how I missed you guys I feel like it's
been forever since I've been sitting
down and filming a video for you guys
but today I'm back and I figured since
back-to-school is literally right around
the corner I apologize for those of you
that still have to go back so I figured
for today's video I was going to do
something a little bit different I'm
gonna do half of my face drugstore and
then the other half higher-end and
hopefully that way you guys can see that
if you find the right drugstore products
you can really recreate any look that
I've used in the past or any look really
out there whatsoever you don't need to
go out and spend all this money on
makeup because guaranteed you're gonna
get a very very similar look so some of
these drugstore products I have not
tried yet so what I figured I would do
is again do half my face half my face
and then kind of update you guys
throughout the day and let you know how
it's all holding up also before I get
into today's video tomorrow is the
launch of my Carli bybel collection with
misguided so anyone who wasn't able to
get it the first round fingers crossed
that you can all get what you want they
ordered literally like quadruple the
amount of the first round so hopefully
that way everybody can get what they
want so I just wanted to mention that as
well but other than that let's get right
into the video let me know if you guys
want me to do a drugstore haul I kind of
picked up like a bunch of products just
because I wanted to make sure I had the
right stuff to get this video completed
today but um the first product that I'm
going to be using is this elf poreless
face primer I have not tried this one
yet I have tried the NYX one the NYX
poreless before and I did really liked
that one but I figured let me try it for
one and plus I really like elf so I
wanted to use a little bit more of elf
products so I'm going to do I guess my
left side with the drugstore so I'm just
going to apply this all over the left
side of my face
it kind of smells like I mean to do that
kind of smells like eucalyptus a little
bit I wonder if there than a eucalyptus
in it as some of you know I was on
vacation last week so I don't know you
could tell but my whole forehead is
peeling it actually doesn't look as bad
now I think cuz my pan is kind of fading
a little bit but it was like really bad
for the first couple of days
oh there's tea tree oil that's probably
what I smelled in and then for the
higher-end side I'm using the tarte
cleanslate poreless primer i also wanted
to mention that all the products and i'm
using today are cruelty free so if you
guys can make the effort you can find a
really really great product that are not
tested on animals so that has also been
another thing that i've been not
struggling with but it's been about
finding new products that i really like
that are cruelty free and swapping out
all of my non cruelty free items like
for instance if i were to film this
video last year i probably would have
used a lot of like l'oreal and
Maybelline and all that and today I went
to the store and I just only wanted to
get anything cruelty free so I picked up
some owl some NYX and also um Physicians
Formula I also know that Milani is
cruelty free they didn't sell it at the
Harmons that I was at though it's nice
to make an effort because I know a lot
of you guys are animal lovers so if you
can buy a product that is not promoting
the animal cruelty why wouldn't you do
it right it just makes sense so from
just applying the primer I'm going to
have to say that so far the tarte looks
like it blurred my pores a little bit
more but we shall see as far as the
foundation and all of that so since this
is a back-to-school look I wanted to do
like a BB cream and I wanted to keep it
pretty lightweight that way it's more
realistic I mean for me I love layers
and layers and layers that's just how I
like to do my makeup but today I'm going
to keep it pretty natural that way
Marcus a natural because for some people
natural is like one layer but um and I
keep it pretty simple that's the better
word so it's so funny I went and I
picked out a couple foundations and also
BB creams today and when I got home all
of them were just way too light which is
crazy and I also went into my stash of
BB creams and they were all too light as
well I just got really tan when we were
Jamaica and luckily I had a really dark
NICs tinted moisturizer so I'm gonna
blend in this one is in the color almond
and I'm going to mix that in with the
NYX BB cream I don't think I've ever had
this problem that I can't find peace
well that calf just fell on the floor
and got all over my floor but the best
part about my floors in my Beauty room
is that they are tile so it's tile that
looks like wood so if anything spills on
it it wipes right up which is literally
perfect for me so after mixing it it's
basically the closest I think I'm going
to get to my skin tone but with
everything else that I'm going to be
applying if it's not perfect it's okay
so I'm just going to dot that onto my
face and when you're finding a BB cream
or anything that matches your skin just
always match it to your chest that way
when you blend it on your face in your
neck it's not going to be a different
color now I have my damn Beauty Blender
and I'm just gonna push it into my skin
I always like using BB creams when I was
in school because they're a lot lighter
on your skin especially when it's still
warm out like September maybe a little
bit of October it's still gonna be
pretty warm and then for the higher-end
SIA I'm going to be using the Tarte
Amazonian clay weepy cream this one is
definitely one of my favorites this is a
little lighter but but again we'll make
it all work
I owe you guys a smoothie recipe video
don't think I forgot because I did it
so next I'm just gonna contour my nose
I'm going to use the la girl Pro conceal
this is my all-time favorite nose
contour products like ever so I'm not
going to use a higher-end product
because I never personally use a
higher-end product to contour so again
this part is also optional most people
don't contour their nose on a daily
basis for like a natural look but for me
personally I feel more comfortable with
my nose contoured so I'm just going to
do that really quick with again the LA
girl Pro conceal and beautiful bronze I
believe these they're like 2 or 3
dollars
so before I blend the nose in I'm going
to conceal I'm going to be using on the
drugstore side the la girl Pro conceal
and creamy beige I'm just going to apply
this like right under my eyes a little
bit there um and yeah what I'll just do
this for the center because I can't
really split it and then a little bit on
your chin and like a little bit up there
and then for the higher-end side I'm
using the NARS creamy concealer in the
color ginger this one's my favorite so
get a little bit under the eyes on the
chin a little bit up here it should be
good I also have the pro conceal in warm
honey it's a little bit darker I'm just
going to apply a tiny bit on there just
because again I'm really really tan
right now my normal colors just aren't
working for me I'm gonna just blend my
nose in with my fingers a little bit and
then I'm gonna blend out the concealers
in a downward triangle as Holy
after blending in my undereyes I would
say the NARS has a little bit fuller
coverage from what I'm noticing but it's
nothing that drastic whatsoever so
compared to each other I'm actually
really happy with how the LA girl is
holding up
so before I set my concealer I'm going
to go in with browse for the drugstore
side I'm using the NYX micro brow pencil
in the color espresso
and for brow powder I'm using by salon
perfect I forgot the exact name but it's
like the brow powder I'll link it for
you guys and that's just to fill it in
of course I lost my eyebrow brush when
we came back from Jamaica I don't know
if it's in my bed somewhere but I can't
find it so this little brush left to do
and then for the higher end side I'm
going to be using my Anastasia brow Wiz
in the color dark brown
anyway going and to fill them in with
powder I'm using the dark brown brow
powder also by Anastasia
so next I'm going to set my under eyes I
can't find my next loose powder I have
searched everywhere and I just can't
find it so I'm going to use the NYX stay
matte but not flat powder foundation to
set underneath my eyes so I'm just going
to blend out the little wrinkles and
then set it with this I'm going to use
my Beauty Blender and just push the
product under the eye and this is going
to help prevent any creases throughout
the day
and then for the higher end side I'm
going to use the Kat Von D foundation
powder as well normally I would use a
loose powder but since I couldn't find
the loose powder on the side I want to
do the exact same products that way you
guys can get the same result so I'm just
going to blend out the wrinkles again
and then set it with this
to set the nose contour on the side I'm
going to be using this grayer tone from
the NYX contour palette I'm just going
to be going right over those lines
and for the higher end side I'm going to
be using the Kat Von D shade + light and
I'm going to be grabbing the gray tone
in that as well
with that same Knicks foundation I'm
going to be seeing a little bit on this
brush and I'm going to be blending out
the sides like just patting it really on
top of that Brown we just applied that
way it's going to look more natural so
again I know this is a lot of steps but
if you want to contour your nose this is
how it's going to look the most natural
if you don't then you can just skip all
these steps altogether and I'm picking
up the Kat Von D and doing the same
thing going right over those brown lines
tapping and then swiping up so today I
also picked up this elf bronzer palette
I can get it if I'm using drugstore
products I usually use the NYX contour
kit so if you want to just use that you
can use that as well but I figured I
would try out a new product today so it
has two mats and to shimmer bronzers in
it I'm going to probably have to mix
these two this one looks a little pink
this one looks a little light so we'll
see I'm going to mix the two of them and
just start contouring or just bronzing
up really
can apply a little bit under on my neck
and also on my chin or my jawline and
then I'm going to apply the Kat Von D on
the other side so in my opinion of
course there's always going to be some
products that are favorites over others
but I really feel like brushes and
technique can really really change how a
product can work on your face so like
for instance right now I'm not really
seeing a huge difference it kind of
looks like I just did my face all with
the same products which is really cool
which was what I was hoping for but I
mean you just never know I've never I
don't think I've ever done half
drugstore half eye and maybe I did I
have a really bad memory for blush I'm
going to be using the Milani powder
blush and awakening rose it's like a
pretty mob color I have bears hair all
over my brushes no surprise and let's
see how this color looks this is really
pretty a kind of is like almost like a
highlighter blush like it has a lot of
like shimmer in it not shimmer but like
shine to it I don't know if you could
see clearly like this I've never charged
these Milani brushes brushes I've never
tried these Milani blushes before but
really like how that's looking I tried
to find the closest one possible this is
a Tarte blush I'd tape and all them so
there's no names I'm gonna try and
figure out which one this is though I'm
going to apply that on the higher-end
side so this one's matte unlike the
Milani I'm not gonna lie I like the
Milani better I love this color for sure
but I kind of like how the Milani gives
you a little bit of a sheen because you
guys have probably noticed but I haven't
put highlighter on my face like on my
cheeks and I don't even know how long
just because I want it to match I'm
gonna apply a little bit of that Milani
over
give it that pretty shine you can still
see like there's some powder foundations
left on my Beauty Blender I'm just going
to push that into my skin that way it's
going to kind of blend in that powder
with the blush and the blush isn't so
harsh so you could see it already toned
it down a lot
so foreshadow I'm going to keep it
really simple on the eyes I picked up
this Physicians Formula shimmer strips
this is what it looks like
haven't tried it yet they feel almost
like kind of like cream shadows a little
bit what do I want to do I guess I'm
going to pick the second color down it's
kind of like a champagne shimmer and I'm
going to apply that on my eyelid
and there's a lot of fallout with this
lovely so be careful so your best option
is using like a setting spray dipping
your brush where's my brush go don't
ever do that like you use something you
put down and then it just goes missing
like so I'm dipping it into my setting
spray and I'm going to pick up a little
bit more hopefully this time that won't
get all over
so I was originally going to do like
high-end verse drugstore on my whole
face but you know what I think
since my face is looking basically all
the same I'm going to go in with just
drugstore products for my eyes since
usually when do you guys see what just
have like the brushes in my hand like
it's right here
I just don't understand I'm gonna do the
same eyeshadow on this eye so I'm gonna
dip it first and then apply I really
like how sparkly this is and then I'm
going to grab a large fluffy blending
brush and I'm going to grab a little bit
of this top bronzer just a tiny bit and
I'm just going to apply that in my
crease just a little bit the reason that
I like to add a tiny bit of like shout
out into my crease is because it adds a
little bit of dimension it opens up your
eyes so if you want to skip the sparkly
step altogether you could just apply a
little bit of bronzer or even like a
brown matte shadow in your crease and
it'll help open up your eyes and it
won't look like you have any makeup on
so since we're sticking with just
drugstore for the eyes I'm going to be
using this brown gel liner file they
make it kind of difficult to get out
this is it so I'm going to use this elf
one it's called coffee you guys can use
the black one if you guys prefer but I
always use black and I think it Browns a
little bit lighter for school and like
an everyday type of look just a little
baby wing for mascara I'm using I've
never tried this before it's the argon
wear mascara by seditions formula it
came in a cute little bottle so I
figured I'd try it out and I do lashes I
like to do the bottom and the top
especially if I'm not wearing falsies
because it makes them thicker this just
get under my eye already
and then for the higher-end side Tarte
lights camera flashes because this is my
other current one I always use I would
say they did a decent job I'm going back
to this palette and I'm picking up this
shade right here and I'm just going to
apply that in my tear ducts and I'm
going to take a little bit as well and
I'm applying that on the bridge of my
nose
for lips I'm going to be using my NYX
pencil in natural I wear this like
almost every night while we were away
it's just one of my favorite drugstore
lip products I mean it's one of my
favorites altogether anyway but um I
figured I'm just going to do drugstore
lips
and I just apply that all over my lips
because I'm really into matte lips
obviously it's all I ever wear and I
just think it's like such a good natural
everyday type of color and then this lip
color looks really great with the blush
and the overall look and then to finish
off this look I'm using the la girl pro
setting HD high definition setting spray
long-lasting and matthan and I always
recommend like a matte finishing spray
because if you're gonna use that daily
spray I just feel like sitting in school
all day you're going to get oil in a
little bit greasy anyway so the map will
help keep it looking nice and matte
another thing that I recommend bringing
is either a mattifying powder or even
the foundation powder that you use put
it in your purse that way throughout the
day if you get a little bit oily or
anything like that you can just kind of
blot it and keep it looking matte and
fresh all day so I'm actually very
pleasantly surprised with how this
turned out I feel like the drugs are in
the high-end side look exactly the same
I'm gonna go in natural lighting so you
guys can see my makeup and natural
lighting because right now I have my
ring lights in front of me but overall
I'm actually really really pleased so
yay look at my little sleepy boy who's
up all night hang with mommy while she
films you were sweet little babe where's
Bobo your brother I here with you Cindy
on the shelf also keeping mommy company
nice sweet girl all her hair's growing
back she's becoming so fluffy again huh
yeah so I'm gonna go out my trend or so
you guys can see how it looks
right today hot today right yeah this
probably was not a good area actually
I'm gonna go in the back hey how's it
goin little boo
there you go big Boosh I'm get so big
baby boy I'm a big boy look at these big
myths we brought him to the vet to get
his third round of shots and the vet was
like he's gonna be huge
he's already like seven pounds and he's
only like six months and look just look
at this though yeah yeah just sleep all
day and then keep me up all night okay
you know your usual thing this right now
is like I feel like the best lighting
I'm standing right in front of my door
you could see there's no ring lights or
anything like that in front of me so I'm
actually very pleasantly surprised with
some of the new products that I tried
out which is awesome and it looks great
and natural lighting too which is also
really awesome yeah so typical filming
attire guys dress sweats cat hair all
over the sweats and up be hey hi guys so
I've been editing all day it's currently
611 I just wanted to give you guys an
update on how my makeups holding out I
went upstairs to just add a little bit
more mascara because I have a severe
problem where I just pick it off all day
me and Brett are running out to get some
sushi really quick and I first ii was
like okay the drugstore one held out a
little bit better but then when i
remembered that this was the side that i
did my I see drugstore I meant the
higher end was better but then when I
was looking in the mirror my higher
inside I had like all like creases under
my eye and this side stayed pretty much
perfectly so I would have to say overall
ruts walking in behind me okay I would
have to say overall drugstore just as
good for this look specifically of
course
so as I was saying I think the drugstore
side actually held up a lot better and
as I've been editing the video and
seeing all the prices you guys if you
are on a budget do not feel like you
need to go out and buy all these
high-end products of course it's nice to
have some because we all love some
higher-end products but for it but front
every day type of look don't feel like
you need to use all the products that
we're constantly using in our tutorials
and everything like that so we're off to
go get food right now
so this video will definitely be up
tonight I'm almost done editing it now
I'm just gonna add this little clip in
at the end so we just got back from
dinner don't mind me I already picked up
all my mascara because I'm crazy and
when I don't wear fake lashes I just
pick them off but I wanted to let you
guys know that the gel liner I think is
the only thing that I'm not so happy
with it didn't really hold up too well
so I just wanted to let you guys know
because I know I mentioned all the
drugstore products were great which they
really all were and maybe if I added a
little bit more on the gel liner and it
would have been better but it is fading
a little bit which usually my eyeliners
don't fade that much so just wanted to
point that out so I was gonna do like a
chitchat and tell you guys what's been
going on in this video but I figured
since there's probably a lot of people
watching this that maybe don't know me
that well or don't really care I figured
I would keep this on the ends of the
video but I just wanted to let you guys
know obviously we all know I've been not
really active that much on YouTube the
past couple of months and I filled you
guys in you guys know I recently moved
and it's been a lot with the house and
everything like that but that really it
has not been the main sting I really
haven't felt like myself to cup the past
couple of months I've been like in this
weird mood all the time and I've been
very like stressed and very like upset
over things that like normally would
never affect me and as you guys know
I've been suffering with eczema really
really bad as of lately I've had it for
probably at least 10 years but it's
always come and gone and it was never
that severe but ever since like March
April my eczema has not gone away
whatsoever so normally like certain
places like for instance on my hand and
on my legs like is bearable I can like
live with it it's not
that's gonna affect my daily life but to
get a little bit personal I also have
eczema on private areas as well top and
bottom so that's what makes it super
super hard for me because it's just so
itchy and I've gone to like three or
four different doctors and finally I
went to a doctor who I know for sure is
going to be helping me I've gone to so
many dermatologists and they just
prescribed me steroid creams and
everything like that and it got to a
point where steroid creams don't even
work for me anymore I've been
researching about eczema for so long and
I know that it's something internal so I
finally went to a doctor who knows that
eczema is internal because I feel like
every dermatologist you go to they just
want to make money and they just want to
send you to the pharmacy to go pick up a
prescription that cost a hundred dollars
and that isn't gonna work or it's a
temporary fix
so I finally found somebody who is
trying to heal me from the inside out so
when I went to see him I found out that
I have a leaky gut syndrome which means
I have holes in my digestive tract which
means that everything that I'm digesting
food and everything that is not getting
to all my organs properly so I'm like
90% protein deficient and like there's
so many other things that are just
really wrong with my body so the doctor
was explaining to me how with all of
this strain going on inside of my body
my gallbladder has been sending out like
lots of stress and I've just been not my
so it makes sense as to why I haven't
been myself because really all my organs
inside are just like not getting the
proper nutrients that they need and
they're just constantly stressed and I'm
constantly itchy so it's kind of like a
whole crazy scenario that if you don't
have eczema maybe won't understand but
I'm happy to know at least that the
reason that I haven't really been
feeling like myself is because my inner
body is not working properly so I'm on a
bunch of supplements right now trying to
stop the problem and then I'm gonna go
back to him and start healing the
problem so fingers crossed that I will
be 100% back to myself again very soon
so you guys get to really only see like
a little percentage of my life and I
never ever want to come on video and
like the sad or depressed or anything
like that I always like to be happy and
show you guys like my happy side because
you all make me happy and I know some of
you watching my videos get happy
watching my videos so you guys real
I haven't seen the struggle as much you
had enough heard me complain about a
little bit but you really don't know how
much it's really been bothering me so
like every single day I've been taking
salt baths Epsom salt baths and oatmeal
baths because it's the only thing that's
really soothe is the itch so like when I
tell you I'm itchy for hours on end and
it's like the worst areas ever and my
skin is just inflamed and then the one
of my leg got infected from scratching
so much so it really has been like a
little bit crazy on this end so I do
apologize I really haven't been myself
lately and I promise that I am going to
be back in the swing of things this is
my second video this week and I will be
getting my Jamaica blog up this week as
well I also know that my giveaway
winners will be announced before the end
of the month so don't think I forgot
about that it's just any free time that
I have if I'm not cleaning and
organizing and doing stuff for the house
I'm in bed or I'm laying on the couch
because I'm trying to prevent myself
from itching myself so thank you guys so
much for bearing with me I know majority
of you guys understand but for those of
you who have been upset with me that I
haven't been so active I do really
apologize and I promise this was only
temporary YouTube is my number one and I
never ever want to stop making videos of
course as I always say as long as you
want to continue to see them so I hope
that you guys enjoyed this video and I
look forward to filming a lot more
videos for you guys let me know if you
guys want more drugstore makeup
tutorials if you want more back to
school videos I know last year I did a
back to school like outfit video let me
know if you guys want something like
that as well I'm always up for
suggestions and I have a whole list of
videos that I do plan on filming for you
guys as soon as possible thank you guys
again for bearing with me during this
crazy time I'm trying to figure out
everything and trying to get myself
better and that's the number one because
I I really want to be myself all the
time not just when I'm filming for you
guys I want to feel like myself every
single day all day even if I'm not
filming so that is really it um again my
clothing line launches tomorrow I don't
have an exact time yet but as soon as I
get that info I will be posting it and I
will be posting on all my social media

I said they ordered so much more than
the first round so I'm hoping it doesn't
sell out for at least a couple days a
couple weeks anything like that
so fingers crossed everyone can get what
they've been waiting for thank you all
so much for your love and support with
my collection so far with my palette

what has been keeping me going through
some of the personal struggles that I've
been dealing with at home so I love you
