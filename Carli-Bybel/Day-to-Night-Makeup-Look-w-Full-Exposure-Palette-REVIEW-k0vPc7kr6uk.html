check out my son
unlike any
always be my daughter
yeah sure
hi everyone thank you for watching
so today I'm going to be doing two
different makeup looks for you guys one
daytime look and then I'm going to
transition it into a nighttime look I'm
using my new Smashbox full exposure
palette and one of the main reasons I
love this palette is because when you
purchase it it comes with this little
pamphlet and it goes to a bunch of
different steps to help you identify
what eye shape you have so like fashion
we all have different body types so we
have to find the proper clothing that
would fit our body types
it's the same thing when applying makeup
I've seen a lot of you guys comment on
my videos saying well I tried out your
makeup look and I just did not like how
it looked on me it looked crazy on me
and it looks way better on you and the
main reason for that is because we all
have different eye shapes so once you
can identify what eye shape you have it
will be a lot easier if you guys to do a
makeup look that's more appropriate for
your eye shades what's really cool is
they not only have this pamphlet but
they have a video on their YouTube
channel which I will link below and it
goes to a bunch of steps to help you
again identify your eye shape so for
those of you wondering what kind of eye
shape you have definitely check it out I
will link it below because it's really
interesting and it's nice to see
different ideas on how you can apply
your shadow to give your eyes the best
most beautiful look possible along with
this makeup look I'm going to be holding
a huge giveaway if you guys want to hear
details on how to enter stay tuned to
the end of the video and I will be
discussing all the ways in which you can
win the prizes I'm personally going to
be giving out two of these full exposure
palettes and also smashbox is holding a
huge giveaway as well so definitely stay
tuned to the end of my video and i will
go over all those details with you so if
you want to learn how to get this day to
night makeup look please keep watching
what's so great about this palette is
it's going to help you guys find out
what your eye shape is so you can make
the most out of your makeup experience
so to say I think this is one thing that
many people forget to do people see a
look on Instagram or on YouTube and they
think oh let me just copy this exactly
and it will look exactly the same well
since we all have different shapes it's
more important to find out which shade
should be going on what part of your eye
one of the reasons I love this palette
is because it has 14 different neutral
shades it has everything from the nudes
to the blacks so it's perfect for again
a day to night look I love it also
because it has the matte and the shimmer
options as I mentioned it does come with
this pamphlet that's going to help you
identify your eye shape as well as give
you three different options that they
suggest would look great for your eye
shape not only that but they're going to
be giving you one two and three options
as to where you should apply which shade
so the options are honestly limitless is
just a great guide for those of you who
are beginning out or for those of you
trying to find your eye shape or trying
to find that perfect go to look so
what's cool about this palette is it
comes with two extra goodies
it comes with a sample size of the full
exposure mascara and it also comes with
this double-sided brush
to start off this look you're going to
prime your eyes with either a eyes
shadow primer or a concealer the first
color I'm picking up is this light
sparkly champagne color and I'm going to
be applying this on the inner corner of
my lid as well as underneath my eyebrow
then with my blending brush I'm picking
up this matte tan color and I'm going to
be applying this right in the crease of
my eye
then picking up the starker champagne
Sparkle color I'm going to be applying
that on the rest of my eyelid before
applying the shadow I dip my brush and
fix+ and that is just so the shadow
sticks better to my brush if you don't
have fix plus you can use eye drops in
place of that grabbing that same color
and a small angled brush I'm going to
start lining my lower lash line then
grabbing the stark Brown Sparkle color
and that same angled brush I'm going to
be lining the outer part of my lower
lash line and then dragging it into the
inner part
next I'm lining my lips with this
neutral colored lip liner and then
following that I'm applying this nude
lipstick picking up the original shimmer
color that I had used on my eyes I'm
then gonna be applying this right on the
Cupid's bow of my lips this is just to
highlight
for the last step I'm just applying a
highlighter in bare light and I'm
applying this right on my cheeks and
this is just going to give my cheeks a
nice shimmery look to match my eyes and
my lips
so moving on to our night look we're
just going to be building from the
original look I'm picking up this dark
brown matte color with my pencil brush
and I'm just going to be coloring in my
outer crease
grabbing this blending brush I'm just
gonna be blending in all the work that I
had just done
picking up this pan matte beige color
I'm then going to be dragging that in
from the dark brown color into my eyelid
picking up that same matte brown color
and a small angled brush I'm going to be
lining my lower lash line to line my
upper lash line I'm just using black gel
liner as usual
just grabbing a little bit of the black
mat color I'm going to be applying that
right on the outer V of my eye just to
make this look a little bit more
dramatic to top this look off I'm using
a peach colored blush and I'm applying a
pinkish peach lipstick so this is the
final look for look number two now if
