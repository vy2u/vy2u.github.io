today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this Arab inspired makeup look
last night I was searching all over
Pinterest and I found so many gorgeous
photos so I tweeted asking if you guys
wanted to see this type of look and
everybody was saying yes and everyone
was telling me to incorporate gold and
purple so this is the look that I came
up with I do apologize because I did
tweet that it was an Arabic style look
and a lot of people were correcting me
saying it should be either Arab or
Arabian so please correct me if I'm
wrong but if you want to learn how I got
this dramatic makeup look please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
going to be priming my eyes with my bare
minerals five-in-one cream eye shadow
so as you can see on this eye it's like
a perfect line going straight out so
what I'm going to be using for this look
is a piece of tape this is a piece of
medical tape I didn't have regular
scotch tape but what you're going to
want to do is you're going to start at
your nose and then drag it up and just
tape it right against your eyes I used
to do this all the time when I first
started out doing makeup and it really
helps keep everything neat looking and
perfect so the way to tell that's in the
right spot because I think this part can
be hard for some people is just think of
how thick you want your lower lashline
to be and I always leave like a little
space and then I apply it up if that
makes any sense
with my Sigma e-40 brush I'm picking up
a little bit of this purple color just
very lightly gapping it in and we're
going to start applying this color right
into the crease
with my Sigma e25 brush I'm picking up
this matte darker purple shade again
just a little bit and we're going to be
applying that right underneath the first
color that we did so it's not going to
go directly in the crease but right
above it and right below that pink color
I'm gonna picking up this bright purple
color with the same blending brush and
again same step just apply it right
underneath that second color
so you can see already how it's starting
to fade with the three colors it's going
to give you a really nice blended look
without having to do too much blending
from the tamanna' palette I'm picking up
the color noir with my pencil brush and
this is a super super pigmented black so
that's why I'm choosing this one what
we're going to for this color is we're
going to start applying it right on the
outer V of the eye blending it up into
the crease and also about a third of the
white on the lid
and we're slowly blending it over now
we're going to go back in and we're
going to darken all these shades but
we're just doing kind of the start of it
all right now
I'm then picking up the foil - eye
shadow magic act by anastasiya and I'm
applying this all over my eyelid and to
really make this gold pop I'm using a
little bit of this liquid gold pigment
by makeup geek it's a little bit more of
a green or gold so I'm going to apply
that right over it just to really make
it stand out
for eyeliner I'm using by Sigma in the
color wicked we're going to be lining
our upper lash line and giving it a very
long extended wing
we're going to be extending it right in
the inner to make our eyes look a lot
longer
we're going to be connecting it right on
the lower lash line
I'm going to take a little bit more of
that black shade with my smaller
blending brush and I'm going to start
blending it a little bit more to really
darken it up and make it blend nicer
okay so now at this point we can take
off the tape you can see how it gives it
a perfect line so for lashes I wanted to
do something very dramatic and focus on
the thickness and the width on the outer
half so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to be putting the t/o lash which
is by the lure I'm mixing this lash and
I'm putting it on top of my Ardell wispy
once those are on right you just want to
apply a little mascara to your natural
lashes just to blend them in with the
false ones so now moving on to the lower
lash line I'm going to take a little bit
of the gel liner and I'm going to be
applying it on my lower waterline
with a small pencil brush I'm taking a
little bit more of that black shadow and
I'm going to start smudging underneath
my eye
with this Sigma II 20 brows I'm picking
up a little bit of that original I guess
magenta colored shadow and I'm going to
be lining that right underneath where I
just did the black
and then mascara for the lower lash line
if you guys want to apply false lashes
on the bottom I would definitely say go
for it for this type of look but my
lower lashes are pretty long and they
kind of still show with this look so I'm
not going to be using those today I'm
picking up a little bit more of that
gold shade and I'm applying it right
here to bronze up my face I'm using this
middle shade from the Kat Von D contour
palette and then I'm grabbing this
grayish shade to contour
for blush I'm using color petal power by
Mac
the highlight I'm using the Kiko shadow
number 208 I'm using the color natural
by NYX for lipstick I'm using nude creme
number 26 by Milani and then over that
I'm using Spring Fling by Gerard
cosmetics
you
so this is the final result it's super
dramatic and I absolutely love how it
came out it definitely took me a lot
longer than most looks would take me so
if you guys are going to try this look
give yourself some extra time but that
is it for now I hope you guys enjoyed
and until next time I'll see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
