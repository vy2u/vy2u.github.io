see world in half is bad they painted to
be for the sons all the daughters stop
to take it and hopefully the hate
subsides and the love can begin hi
everyone thank you for watching so today
I'm gonna be teaching you how I got this
valentine's day inspired makeup look it
is definitely more dramatic so I would
recommend this if you're going out
whether to dinner or even a night out so
don't do this for daytime look it's
definitely a little bit too much this is
going to be the last video I post before
I leave for vacation so thumbs up if you
guys want to see a V log of me and Bret
while we're away in Punta Cana I can see
something like I did for the Miami one I
also wanted to talk about this dress
that I'm wearing right now I found this
new website it's called sexy dresses
calm and I really wanted to share this
with you guys because it is a very very
affordable website you can find all
kinds of really cute dresses for a very
very low budget and I actually got a 10%
coupon code for 30 days from today
so besides the fact that there are early
low prices you can get 10% off so
definitely go check out the website I'll
put the links below and also my necklace
I know a lot of you will probably be
asking about this it's so pretty I'm so
obsessed with this it's from ludora
boutique I'm sure you guys have seen me
mention her a bunch all of her jewelry
is handmade so when I got this I was
like oh my gosh is Valentine's Day
written all over it so again I'll post
the links below where you can purchase
these and if you guys want to learn how
I did my makeup please keep watching
first I'm thinking is vanilla pigment by
Mac and I'm going to be applying this
all over my entire eyelid
whenever I'm doing a more dramatic I one
thing I will always do is take a very
very light brown color I'm gonna think
that color from my brow bar the lighter
brown color and I'm just gonna be using
this big fluffy Mac brush and I'm just
gonna be going right into my crease so
this is gonna show where your crease is
and you're also going to know not to
take the darkest color above that point
so as you can see that just added a
little bit of a shadow and by doing just
this little snap it's gonna really help
bring together the whole look and it's
gonna make it look more complete so my
last part wasn't recording when I was
recording but all that I just did was I
took this small angled brush and the
black eye shadow from my 120 palette and
what I did is I just drew a short line
right underneath my eye and I extended
it outwards and once you do that you
know you don't want the darker color to
go any further than right here so then
I'm just gonna take this color and I'm
going to drag it up onto my eyelid
taking my smaller mac blending brush and
a little bit of the black on the top
just like barely barely dip it in you're
now going to blend that in
next by l'oréal I'm taking this black
gel liner and it's called l'oreal
infallible lacquer liner and it's in
blackest black and i'm going to be using
this small brush i'm just going to be
lining my upper lash line so at this
point you can apply your false lashes
next i'm going to draw a dark line under
my eyes i'm going to be using a little
bit of the black and then just a little
bit of brown over it and then using this
brown shimmer color i'm going to be
applying this right over that so now
we're going to go back to that vanilla
pigment we had used first and i'm just
going to make it a little bit brighter
on my lid then i'm gonna be taking this
frost mac pigment and i'm just gonna be
applying just a little bit right on top
of that white color
if you decide to wear bread this
valentine's day i do suggest doing a
nude lip i think that looks the best
with red so for this look I'm using
morning coffee lip liner by Mac a
drugstore alternative is my Jordana
cosmetics 21 but I actually ran out so I
have to go purchase another one so in
the meantime I'm going to be using my
Mac one and I'm just gonna outline my
lips
for lipstick I'm using myth by Mac and
this is this nice nude color
one thing I always do after I apply my
lipstick is I go back to the lipliner
and I kind of shade it in a little bit
just so it doesn't look like a line and
then your lipstick color
and to top it off I'm using Boise by Mac
it's a cream machine lip gloss and it's
also a nude color and this is just going
to add a little bit of a glossy look to
it so this is how the final look came
out and I wanted to wish everyone a
happy Valentine's Day I know it's two
days early but I will be a way Thursday
through Sunday so I won't be posting a
video so I hope you guys have an amazing
weekend and I promise I will be posting
as soon as I get back I'm pretty sure me
and Brad are gonna do a vlog while we're
away in Punta Cana so thumbs up if you
guys want to see that and I will talk to
you guys see you and have an amazing
time I know
baby I'm just dreaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
