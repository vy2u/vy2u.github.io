here where you going with that foot hi
everybody thank you for watching today I
was playing a limb to get my license
photo and I'm still going after I record
this but I figured you know what let me
do a makeup tutorial for anyone who
maybe is going out to get their license
and they don't know how to do their
makeup lesson I took the photo
um my license had expired so I thought
what I went to just renew it I didn't
have to retake my photo I was personally
liked my license photo it kinda came out
like pretty decent so we just kind of
roll out of bed and then went over to
the DMV and they said when you renew
your license you need to retake your
photo so I had literally zero makeup on
I will pick up complete hot mess it's
not prepared so ever to take my photo so
it kind of inspired this video because I
knew today since we didn't move when I
knew that dress I need a new license
with my new address
anyway plus I want to take my photo so I
figured I would fill this makeup look
that way and you guys are going for your
license photo you can maybe follow this
routine and hopefully look nice and
fresh in your new photo for this look I
could use all drugstore products so if
you guys want to see my makeup routine
as well as a little vlog at the end
please watching to start off this look
I'm using the LA girl smoothing primer
I'm applying this all over my face don't
mind the pimples I've been using this
new face wash and it's supposed to
really clean out your pores so that's
why I'm assuming I have pimples but we
shall say so I'll keep you guys updated
but I haven't had a breakout like this
in a while anyway so for foundation I'm
using by Maybelline the fit me
foundation I am using the one that has
the matte finish I recently just picked
this up at the drugstore so I haven't
used this one in a while but I think it
was like the perfect color for my skin
tones and I really liked how it lasted
throughout the day I'm just applying
this with my Sigma foundation brush and
just kind of buffing it in because I
ended up putting on a little bit more
than planned so next I magically gonna
contour my nose I'm not showing this
plan on camera because I don't think
it's necessary it's just an insecurity
of mine and I personally like contouring
my nose so I skipped over that part if
you guys want a full tutorial you know I
already have one of those up for
concealer I'm using by la girl the
creamy beige concealer and just applying
a little bit under my eye and then with
a damn Beauty Blender I'm blending that
in and downwards triangle this is going
to help really brighten up your face and
make you look super awake and also don't
mind my nose contour I am nowhere near
done so obviously it looks a little bit
orange at this point but don't worry I'm
gonna fix it I just didn't feel like
doing at this point so you just got to
stare at it next I'm grabbing some loose
setting powder I honestly didn't have
any from the drugstore I have to go and
find one I just realize that's probably
product that I can't find since the big
move I did have the next one which I did
like but I'm just using my Ben Nye one
because I have this one out and again I
couldn't find another one for brows I'm
using this NYX eyebrow pencil it's very
similar to the Anastacio Beverly Hills
one that I mentioned I saw one of you
guys comment that it's a dupe so I
wanted to grab it and I think it is I
think it works really great so I do love
it and then I'm just filling in my brows
with my brow bar to diffuse my nose
contour a little bit I'm using the
lighter shade from the NYX contour
palette and then with a blending brush
I'm mixing the two matte shades and I'm
bronzing up my face
don't forget to do your jawline in your
neck so that your face doesn't look like
a different color for eyes I'm going in
with the L'Oreal nude one palette I'm
applying these two lighter shimmer
shades right in my tear duct to really
open up my eyes I'm also applying this
underneath my brows on my Cupid's bow
down the center of my nose and also on
my cheeks
mixing this light brown and pink shade
I'm blending that right into my crease
just to add a little bit of a shadow
it's gonna also help make your eyes look
nice and awake and open even if it's
morning I wanted to make this look fun I
didn't want to make it anything too
crazy of course you can always wear less
but this is what I decided to wear for
mascara I went out to my car and I
searched high and low and I couldn't
find my telescopic and I really don't
have another drugstore mascara that I
would ever recommend to you guys so just
know the L'Oreal telescopic is amazing
but for this video I'm just going to use
my lancome and then for lips I'm using
the NYX pencil and natural I'm lining
them and then I'm just filling them in
because I just wanted to keep it neutral
and it also just looks like a matte
lipstick so it's super easy for blush
I'm using also by NYX and this is a
mineralized blush I believe and it's not
that pigmented but as long as you work
with it it's pretty good so I'm just
going to finish off my blush and you can
set this makeup with the setting spray I
honestly just completely for
so I'm about to go head out right now
and look at my license photo you can
stay here so this is the final result I
hope you guys enjoyed this video now I'm
off to the DMV so I will try and vlogs
much as possible and also let us blog
inside but I'm sure gonna try so I love
you guys so much and until next time
I'll see you guys later hey guys so I
just finished filming I wanted to share
why I decided to wear this color shirt
today they say when you are taking any
professional photos you shouldn't wear a
white shirt or a black shirt just
because of the background and all that
so they say to stick with brighter
colors nothing with patterns I think too
low-cut because remember this photo it's
going to be the photo that you show
everybody all the time so I decided to
wear a long sleeve shirt like this
you're only going to see from your belly
button up and we're probably not even
for me really button up because the last
time that I went it was like a really
close photo of my nan makeup nan hair
done face so that was fun we're heading
out right now and hopefully this photo
comes out better than last time so key
on the blinky time because you guys
don't sleep all night and then as soon
as we're all awake you just want to
sleep doubles
as far as growing back so nicely he's
gonna be fluffy just like his sister we
recently brought him to the vet to get
weighed and checkup in their last shots
and everything and they're both over 6
pounds but he was holding Cindy and he's
like usually Persians they look really
big cuz they're fluffy he's like but
she's solid I'm like yeah that's my
solid girl who's my solid girl like
tattoo she rub so sweet
dang he's massaging her face I'm rubbing
her neck one big happy family
ready oh yeah let's go get our license
photos what do we need to bring we need
to bring passport some mail social
security health insurance and anything
with your name on it all right
so yesterday I went in for a manicure
I have been against nails ever since we
got city embarr because
whenever I've two people over there bot
there was like that was in stuck under
my nails I was just absolutely frozen
unacceptable so I had them off ever
since without them in November and
yesterday I was going in for like a gel
manicure and I was trying on like the
different gel shades you know they put
them I like the long tips you can kind
of like see which color goes where so I
was like holding up each one on like oh
my god I miss having long nails so I
ended up getting nails these are the
pink blush nails that I used to always
get done when I used to go to Walmart so
the place by our house actually does
them so I tried him out and he did a
really really good job usually I'll have
to go home and like reshape them refil
and I did it a little bit but it was
probably the closest to what I wanted in
a while so we'll see how long they last
it hurt really
barking sorry but how are you thank you
may I please have a venti Lite iced soy
chai guys do you think my hair is too
long I feel like I look like a hippie

Andy bathtub where they share some of
course what I'm looking at I just got to
renew our license we just moved into the
area I know we're not in the right spot
Google collie come in do this all the
time
I figured Thank You Man thank you so
much in Edison the closest one
so $44 Russians like 20 minutes from you
god bless thank you so much typical
story of our lives going somewhere that
it's not really where we're supposed to
go just like Monday morning we went
showed about the Duchess knows much that
I know that was my fault so we had a
8:30 I am that disappointment and show
up obviously ten minutes early because
we were we went to a new place so we had
to fill out like mutation forms and
they're like we don't have you in for
today and I look on the counter my phone
and it was the Monday after but luckily
they still took us so it wasn't like we
got up really really early Pronovias
I wonder why I have too much on my
schedule like you don't have a better
planner you wanna play and she walk home
late you see she gave me and I don't
mind that true
that was literally the most stressful
thing ever we were in there over two
hours which is oh so fun and I like my
blue picture better that's one positive
so if you guys do try out this makeup
look I approve of that it looks decent
in pictures um we are supposed to be
meeting someone at our house 40 minutes
ago and we're still 20 minutes away so
Bret just ran and really quick to get a
slice of pizza and then we are rushing
home it's so funny because my old
picture um
I'm so pissed off in and I really was
pissed off because she told me how to
retake my photo even though I didn't
think I had to and I had to make one but
here's a new one obviously if you guys
are going to the DMV I'm sure you know
you're gonna be waiting but um this DMV
they had one person working how do you
have one person working when you have
eight different areas that people could
be working at there was the line
literally wrapped around the whole thing
and outside so get myself situated and
then we are on the road so I think it's
so funny because I had told you guys
about what color you should think about
wearing for your driver's license photo
and the background is basically the
exact same color of the shirt that I'm
wearing so I feel like I couldn't pick
the worst color it really wasn't bad
because you only really see like this up
so it wasn't a problem but after we were
waiting for like two hours on my watch I
want to go up there and they're gonna be
like um can wear that shirt cuz it
matches the background so luckily that
didn't happen
alright so we are heading home I'm going
to edit this video for you guys and yeah
that's about it so I hope you enjoyed I
hope this makeup looks helps for any of
you guys going to get your license photo
love you guys
you
