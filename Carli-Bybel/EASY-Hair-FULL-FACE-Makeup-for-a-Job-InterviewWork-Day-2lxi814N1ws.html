I'm sorry it's been a little bit since I
posted a video I hope everyone had a
great new year I unfortunately had a
death in the family on the 1st of
January so the past week has been a
little bit crazy and hectic and I've
just been with my family and everything
like that so I do apologize for not
being around for the past week but I
wanted to get this video up for you guys
because I had posted a status on
Facebook asking what you all wanted to
see next and I saw one of the most
requested looks was a easy hair makeup
and outfit look for a job interview or
just like a day at the office something
like that so I wanted to show you guys a
really nice neutral look like the makeup
look I have on now and I thought since I
haven't done a hair tutorial a while I
would show you this really cool rope
braid that I learned how to do a few
days ago I think this look is perfect
because is off your face so if you are
going for that interview the last thing
you want is your hair in your face or to
be playing with your hair so I think
this is a really awesome easy way to
switch it up and do something different
with your hair and it looks really
really nice and sleek and yeah so if you
guys want to learn how to get this hair
and makeup look please keep watching and
after this video make sure to go check
out my fashion blog because I did post a
bunch of different options that I would
suggest for a job interview or for work
some slacks some skirts everything like
that so I hope you guys enjoy this video
and I will see you guys next time
the highway let me understand
I pray
you win nothing buddy smile nervous left
there's an eel
Luke got cheese
I've spent years it seems just one Jan
through the
and so came on that
headlights on
the highway
Nishi
with my fingertips I trees on your
biscuit
like to say can huh speak
you mean everything they're not quite
words to tell you all the things that
you've become
headlights are
the highway
I don't need no secrets I gave up on
love
if it's gonna rain I'd rather be blind
I just can't keep my hands off of you
you look so small
Oh wrapped up in my arms I'm so
I'm yours if you are mine
- peace no more
so I wanna deal
lately
now
then we come
sonmi Oh
running from everything it's a ride
I have it
yes in the frenzy
close to your ski you try not to
you're come here to me
yours if you are mine too unreasonable
I wanna live
and I wanna fall asleep then wake up me
me
- fine
so moving on to hair we are going to be
doing a rope braid and to do this you
want to part your hair on the side and
then take two sections of hair from the
front part of your head you're going to
be twisting one piece over the other and
as you grab the new piece you're going
to be grabbing a chunk of hair from the
front of your hair and adding it into
that one strand and then twisting it
over the other strand and you are going
to be repeating the same process or the
front part of your hair so as you pull
the Strand you're going to take a small
chunk from the front and then twist it
to the back
you
once you get to this part of your hair
you're going to want to grab all the
hair from the other side and bring it on
over and this part is going to be a
little bit different when you grab a new
piece this time you're going to be
pulling in the chunk of hair and then
you're going to be twisting it towards
your face and then twisting over the
other piece and the reason you're going
to want to do that is because if you
don't twist it towards your face it's
going to just unravel once you get down
to the bottom
you
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video hopefully learn
something new and if you do have that
job interview make sure to stay really
positive to smile and to just walk in
with confidence because I have faith in
you and I think you will definitely get
that job it's so important to just kind
of throw yourself together make yourself
look really clean and nice because first
impressions are super important so if
you guys follow this tutorial best of
luck to all of you and for everyone just
trying out this look I hope you enjoyed
and until next time I'll see you guys
later
