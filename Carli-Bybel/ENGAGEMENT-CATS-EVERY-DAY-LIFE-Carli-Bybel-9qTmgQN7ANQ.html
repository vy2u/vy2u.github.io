celebrate that as well I have tonight
and then tomorrow we have over 30 people
coming over for New Year's Eve we're
having a 1920s New Year's Eve party so
it's going to be very hectic I'm really
upset I wasn't able to get a New Year's
look up for you guys I was sick in bed
until Wednesday even yesterday I was
going sick but I got out and I had a go
food shopping and I had to get so much
stuff for the parties for the next
couple of days so I won't be getting any
video up before the new year but I
figured out a blog because I really
really want to get a video up but I
can't I'm just going to go start getting
some of the stuff ready and everyone
should be coming over soon yeah
you
you
say it that's what be cool I'm gonna
show you
for me sighs everyone c3t
country before you
hi there
McCrea grass
look at all the decoration you've got
matter today's breakfast
um this is the maple syrup that we use I
like this but likes about should coconut
with your milk crema and sheep
I'm going to go run to the mall really
quick I'm gonna attempt to go to the
mall I want to get like a bigger hard
drive for my computer because as you
guys know I had tried doing the 4k video
and my computer and I guess YouTube just
couldn't handle it
interesting so I'm getting ready to
leave into the wilderness
that is behind me wish me luck
my snow boots on where 90 degrees out no
except the ball it's currently Saturday
I just got my wet nails on last night
so I put my nails off I think I already
explained to you guys why accent sounds
really nice on having an email so I
can't miss it
so so except because I had gotten the
new 4k camera as you guys know or maybe
you don't know I had mentioned a bunch
of times but the camera that I use is
the can 5d Mark 3 so they recently came
out with the mark 4 which has the Forte
filming capabilities which just makes
that video just look like so real and it
makes me seem like you're like sitting
right in front of me so so excited to
try it out but I realized that my
opinion was like 23 minutes long there
was just no way that it was going to
upload I had it uploading for like 13 14
hours on YouTube and it never got past
80% so I had like googled it and it's
apparently with 4k videos you can't
upload one on YouTube that's more than
like 15
so I'm definitely trying again when I
plan into a shorter video for you guys
but since it had been so long since I
had films I wanted to be like it was
long
chitchat video so that was why that
happened
I'm also going to pick up like a beanie
Bret always yells at me that I go out of
the house looking like a hot mess with
my hair a mess so that I should just
going to be me so I'm going to go try
and find one that fits me because
they're just way too big on my head so
it looks silly but probably like forever
21 and yes that's my plan just look up
the Arby's call me crazy but it's
literally snowing 20 degrees and I still
get a string I just cannot do half
strength I start sweating like a movie
Nia
I'm so funny there were people in there
and like full-on snow suits like yes
it's snowing but it's not mine I mean
knowing but like I don't know I find it
a little silly to be out of the whole
snow suit say but hey the each is own
Miranda Lambert's new CD came out it was
in December I believe and that's all
I've been listening to I need to meet
her I was let's do a makeup I was just
like hang out with her one day I know
he's his best friend
so one day my day will come so I just
got here I'm going to go run in I'm
finding my cameras because I'm going to
worry about not slipping on the mall
floor but I'll see you guys see what we
just got back in the car I'm a little
bit happy because I thought I would have
to buy a whole new well I didn't know if
I needed a whole new come here I knew I
needed just like more storage and
everything like that but the storage
that they felt in the MAC store is like
ridiculously expensive so I was talking
to someone who had worked there and
luckily they were super nice and they
had giving me a website where you can
buy like external hard drives you can
buy something for like half the price
and it gives you so much more storage so
I'm definitely gonna go home and do that
I also picked up a couple beanies so I
got a dark gray I got a cranberry
I got bright frickin orange and I got
black so see how they look I know why
this bright orange one was screaming my
name though okay I'm ready for the snow
now literally people will see me from a
mile away I have a sweater at this exact
color so I was like you know if I ever
want to go outside and I don't want to
be hit by a truck I know what to wear
now back home Brett was doing a cooking
video so I'm hoping that the food's
ready because I'm hungry
trying to play Scrabble here
I have to pick letter or typing I can't
get the triple letter you can't either
