so excited to be filming this video for
you guys I have two big announcements
that I wanted to share with you so this
video is not going to be a tutorial or
anything like that so don't worry I will
still have two more of those up this
week we do get the new keys to our house
on Friday so I'm going to try my best
before then to get two more videos up
for you guys but I just wanted to
dedicate a video to two really exciting
things that I wanted to share with you
guys
I'm not going to string you along I'm
going to get right into it so the first
thing that I wanted to announce is that
tomorrow November 18th my Carli bybel
palette will be back in stock officially
back in stock not a pre-order not an
email link not this not that back in
stock we finally got through all of the
pre-order emails so again I wanted to
apologize for everybody who waited but
I'm seeing all of your pictures and it
makes me so happy to see how happy you
guys are receiving it in the mail so for
anyone who didn't sign up for the
pre-order and want to get your hands on
my beautiful new palette it will be back
in stock tomorrow morning I don't have
an exact time so I just wanted to assure
you guys that ever since my last launch
we literally broke their entire website
they had a whole new website built a lot
more servers they should have everything
up and running so there are no crazy
hassles or long waiting periods or
anything like that so yes it is still a
limited edition palette it won't be
around forever so if you guys do want to
get it make sure to head over to the BH
website and then you could just go
purchase it and with the holidays coming
up it's perfect timing it's super
affordable and that's really I think all
I have to say about that for now I'm
really excited about that but the next
news I'm even more excited about um so
before I show you what I'm talking about
I'm going to explain the story because
for those of you guys that have been
with me since the beginning you probably
already know what I'm about to tell you
so my entire life I have been not
deathly allergic but severely severely
allergic to any single animal that I
come in contact with
I rode horses for seven years
and I would go twice a week and I didn't
care I would literally be dying
my nose would be stuffed I couldn't
breathe I'd be sneezing left and right
and I'd have to take that nasal spray
and clarin and yada yada yada but I
still did it because I just love animals
so much I mean anyone who's an animal
lover like can you imagine being
allergic to animals and not being able
to like smush him cuddle them and love
them so I actually grew up my entire
life with a Persian kitten she was a
bull she was a cat she was started as a
kitten she was a white Persian and she
was so beautiful and she was such a
friendly little baby but my entire life
I had a cat so I was always stuffy I
always had allergies growing up and I
just assumed that it was all pollen and
I knew that I was allergic to marshy
because whenever she'd lick me I get
hives and I get itchy or whatever but I
just kind of dealt with it I didn't know
life without having a cat so I didn't
really know what life without allergies
was like dogs cats horses anything you
can imagine I'm allergic to so when I
moved out about three and a half years
ago on my own it was the first time that
I was actually in a place with no animal
and no dander and it was crazy because
my allergies just went completely away
like I had no allergies I realized what
life was like without allergies because
when you grow up your entire life with
allergies and you're always stuffing
you're always sneezing you don't know
what it's like to not live without it so
it was the first time in my life that I
was breathing easy and I just felt so
nice and it was so cool so when we and
Brett started dating he's obsessed with
the animals just as much as I am and
he's allergic to cats and I'm more
allergic to dogs but I'm still allergic
to cats so we just kind of came to the
conclusion that we weren't gonna have
pets and it sucked and we were sad and
believe me we talked about it all the
time like all the time but we just came
to the conclusion that it's not really
worth living life stuffy and miserable
every day and if you can't sleep and
cuddle with your baby every single night
then what's the point of getting one I
feel like it's mean if you have a cat or
a dog or any type of animal you want to
love it and you want to be with it all
the time so that was really the
conclusion that we came to that's the
background of my history with pets I
just want to do fill you guys in for
those that maybe don't know so this past
Sunday me my mom my grandma and my
sister all met up for lunch and my mom
has had
a cat for I think he's three or maybe
four I think three years old his name is
Oliver and he's the cutest little baby
he's a Himalayan and my mom works every
day so during the day he's been home
alone and she started feeling really
guilty and she's been wanting another
cat for a really long time but she I
guess didn't look or whatever the case
may be she was finally ready to find a
new cat so she had done her research
found an amazing breeder and she was
going to look at the kitten
so of course me and Amanda were like oh
we have to join you so we walked in and
there was a couple little kittens
running around and they were precious
like little tiny balls of fluff like
literally if I was holding one in my
hand its entire body could fit in one
hand that's how little they are if you
guys follow me on snapchat you probably
saw my snapchats
it was literally one of the coolest and
best experiences of my life so the house
that we were in she actually has I think
about 13 cats and we ended up saying
there are three hours and it was so
weird because I wasn't itchy I wasn't
sneezing I wasn't anything I did take a
Claridon beforehand but usually even if
I take claritin or benadryl I'm still
allergic so I was so blown away that I
wasn't and the entire time we were
playing with them my sister and my mom
were like you need to get one you should
get one you should get one too and I was
like I can't I can't do that to myself
like as much as I really really want
when I just don't want to be itchy every
day and the three hours later after
playing with them all and bonding with
them all I just couldn't help but leave
with one the lady actually named her
Cindy after Cindy Crawford and there was
no way I could change that name she
literally looks like Cindy Crawford she
has her little cute mole and she's just
literally the most precious thing ever
and at first Lee told me that she wasn't
for sale of course I was playing with
all the other ones but I just kept going
back to Cindy and I was like I need
Cindy in my life so I talked her and I
was like how can we make this work I
need her in my life so eventually she
gave in and I have a new little baby in
my life she's sleeping right on the
floor next to me if you guys follow me
on snapchat you have to see she was
literally sitting on my lap sleeping was
getting ready that's why it's already
dark out because it took me that long to
get ready because I just didn't want to
move because they don't want to
interrupt her perfect little body
sleeping so before I show you guys my
precious little baby I just wanted to
say everything I wanted to say in this
video
because she is sleeping so once I wake
her up I don't know if she's gonna be
fussy or whatever but I just want to let
you guys know that it's so amazing
because the breeder that we ended up
buying them from oh my mom ended up
buying a little boy her brother as well
and yesterday we took her over and they
had a little to our playdate while my
mom was at work so it was really cute
anyways um I'll show you pictures both
of them by the way so I actually asked
her to text me a little bit more info so
I don't mess it up I didn't want to say
anything wrong but when I heard her
story and I heard everything she was
doing with these cats and everything I
just thought it was the most beautiful
thing and I asked her if I could share
what she was doing with you guys what
she does is she does behavior therapy
and it's called ABA and what it does is
it uses positive rewards as motivation
so this is really great for children
with autism children on the autism
spectrum they have great success with
ABA it's pet therapy and it can help
with anxiety and speech delays so I
really wanted to help her spread the
word and if any of you guys have heard
of this before maybe look into someone
in the area that does something similar
if you're not from New Jersey or if you
do breed your own cats maybe this is
something that you could do in the
future it's just a way to help people
and I think it's an amazing thing she
also wanted me to mention that she does
have another kitten for sale I will list
her email below what she does want to do
is she wants to give this kit into a
family with an autistic son or daughter
or someone that has high anxiety anybody
in New Jersey area
if anyone you know or anyone you're
related to has someone in the family
that is suffering I definitely recommend
you reaching out to her and getting one
of these adorable precious beautiful
kittens I think finding alternate ways
to help kids cope with stuff like this
is an amazing thing and not just go
through a pill their way or throw a
different alternative method I think
animals and pets are the most loving
creatures in the entire world and just
me having this cat for the past 48 hours
has shown me a whole new love that I
never even knew existed because I've
never had my own baby before I've had I
had a rabbit I had a bird I had a fish I
had a hamster and everything besides a
cat and a dog because I just wasn't able
to have him in the past so to be able to
have this experience when I never
thought it would be possible it's just
the most amazing thing and I think what
she does is awesome so again if you guys
know anybody help spread
or let's get this little kitten into a
new home and I am getting my little
Cindy girl a sister from the same litter
so she can have a friend to play with
since we are moving and there's gonna be
a little more space we wanted to give
her a little friend so I'm not sure when
we're gonna pick her up but when we do
I'll show you pictures of her as well so
that is the story with that for anyone
wondering why I didn't adopt the reason
that I didn't adopt I think adoption is
amazing but my sister actually just
recently adopted two little precious
babies puff and Pablo and they're
honestly so precious but when I went
over there I was there literally five
minutes my eyes swelled up I couldn't
breathe I was coughing itching sneezing
it was really bad so I that was only a
couple weeks ago even if I wanted to
adopt I didn't even think that'd be an
option anyway because I'm assuming I'm
Way more allergic to short-haired cats
than long-haired cats and some of you
may not understand why but it actually
has to do with their saliva not their
hair the length of their hair so that's
how that whole thing worked out but to
be honest I am still so blown away that
I'm not allergic to this baby she has
slept on my head every single night so
far I'm with her all day I literally
have not put her down playing with her
24/7
and I have not sneeze once so either
it's meant to be and she's only kitten
in the whole world that I'm not allergic
to or there's just some random breeze I
don't know I don't know what the reason
could be but I'm not allergic to her
let's wake this little nugget up and
introduce her to my friends Nona come
meet my friends hmm sleepy baby look at
this little ball of fluff so her name is
Cindy
after Cindy Crawford cuz she's cooked a
little more she's like one of these
bright lights so she is eight weeks old
almost eight weeks old and she's just a
little tiny puff ball I can picture she
looks kind of long but in reality she's
literally the size of my hand and she
looks like a little chipmunk little
gremlin chipmunk but she's the most
precious angel I have quickly become the
biggest cat lady so we're definitely
getting another one I think two is a
good number that way if we ever leave
she has someone to play
and now that I know that for some reason
I'm not allergic to the cats from that
litter I figured we'll get her a sister
and then we'll be all set and we'll have
a nice happy little family so I'm so
excited that I was finally able to share
the big news my palate will be in stock
for good tomorrow
oh yeah no more pre-orders hallelujah

already slaying on the floor sleeping
she is just too cute
