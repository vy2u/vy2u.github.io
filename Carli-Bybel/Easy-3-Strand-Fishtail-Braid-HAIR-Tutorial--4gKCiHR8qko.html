the video is finally here I know a ton
of you guys have been requesting this
hair look ever since I posted a few
pictures a couple weeks ago I was
searching around on Google trying to
find some cool new hair ideas because
I've been bored of the exact same
hairstyles that I always do and I came
across two videos actually and they
inspired me to try out this look so I am
in no mean saying that I created this
look or I invented it it is inspired by
a few that I have seen so if you guys
want to learn how to get it please keep
watching so before I started this look I
clipped in 3 tracks of my Bellamy hair
extensions and this is just to give it
some extra volume so you're gonna want
to make sure your hair is parted however
you want it parted in the front I like
to do it a little bit off to the side
that way I leave like a little bit of a
bang out not that it's even bangs
anymore it's just a long piece of hair
but I'm gonna take all my hair bring it
to one side and my mirror that I'm gonna
be looking at is right here so I
apologize if I'm looking off for most of
this video so with this look we're gonna
be doing three different fishtail braids
and then we're gonna be connecting them
all so the first thing you're gonna want
to do is take a chunk of hair from
underneath so I'm just gonna section off
all this top hair
so I'm taking a section of hair about
this thick and I'm going to start doing
my first fishtail braid
I'll kind of talk you through the first
braid but I also have a fishtail braid
tutorial so you guys need a more
in-depth look on how you do it you can
go check that out I will link it below
so if you guys never did a fishtail
braid before all you do is separate it
into two sections like this and that
you're gonna just be Criss crossing your
hair so what we're gonna do is take a
piece from section one and cross it over
section one and then grab it into
section two like that and you're just
going to repeat the same thing taking a
small piece of hair crossing it over
section two and then putting it into
section one
one thing that's annoying about fishtail
braids is that they just take a lot
longer than a normal braid but it looks
really cool at the end so it is worth it
and also a good thing about this look is
it's gonna be a nice messy fishtail so
you don't have to worry about being
perfect
once you get to the bottom you're just
gonna secure it with a little hair tie
then what you're gonna want to do is
slowly start pulling out the hair and
make it a wider Messier look so you're
just gonna pick out little sections
now that we've loosened this braid a
little bit we're gonna do the exact same
step so what we're gonna do is take down
the hair that we just pinned up and
we're gonna take another section of hair
from underneath here for this look I'm
going to leave this section of hair out
because I'm eventually gonna curl it and
it's gonna be my little bang
so now we're taking another chunk of
hair and it's about the same size and
it's right underneath the top piece and
we are gonna be fishtailing this as well
you
okay so now we're gonna take the rest of
our hair we can get this slip out so now
what you're gonna want to do is make
sure your part isn't in the correct
place I'm gonna keep out about this much
hair in the front which I will later
curl and pin and then I'm gonna take the
rest of this hair and do a third braid
everything that's left we're gonna do in
that third big braid I like to just
throw those overboard this
so now that the third braid is done we
are gonna secure it with an elastic as
we had done with the other ones and then
we're just going to start pulling out
the hair
like that so now we have three big messy
fishtail breeds well one big one and
then two smaller ones what we're gonna
do is we're gonna slowly bobby pin them
together so I'm gonna take a piece of
hair from this side and a piece of hair
from the middle braid and just bobby pin
it together like that then we're going
to attach the third braid to the middle
braid
so now that all three are pinned
together I'm going to take one of the
hair ties off and hair tie it all
together so now that the hardest part is
done I'm going to take down my bangs and
I'm gonna use this curling iron to curl
the front piece of my hair
so of course depending on how much hair
you want to leave out that is up to you
but I'm gonna take this longer piece
that I had kept in and I'm gonna tuck it
behind the braid and that's just so it's
gonna blend nicely into the braid
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and if you guys
try it out make sure to hashtag me
because I get super excited when I see
you guys post pictures and when you
recreate my looks so I love you guys so
much I hope you enjoyed this video I

first tried it out a few weeks ago make
