today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this triple braid hairstyle I
think one of the biggest problems I
always have is on the third or fourth
day that I haven't washed my hair I am
just so lazy I don't feel like washing
it I don't feel like blow-drying it so I
love trying out new hairstyles that you
could do on dirty hair or clean hair so
this look is something I just came up
with it's super fun and messy and it
took me under 20 minutes to do so it's a
little hard to see the braids because my
hair is all one color if you guys have
highlights or lighter hair it'll look a
lot cooler on you but I really loved how
it turned out I have a fishtail braid a
little mini brain and then like my big
giant bright down here so if you guys
want to learn how I got this look please
keep watching this look will work on any
type of hair my hair is just air dried
from my shower two nights ago I never
ended up doing it but I also have two
tracks I'll show you I have two tracks
in of the Bellamy clip and extensions
I'm wearing the 220 gram they are my
favorites besides the Lilly hair the
Lilly hair is a little bit more
expensive the only difference really
between the lily and the 220 gram hair
is that the Lilly hair just is a little
bit thicker and I think it's two inches
shorter but the 220 gram it just is
amazing they're the ones that I always
used until Lilly hair came out so what
I'm gonna do is start with a side part
yeah you can come in though further
better get out before they think we're
doing this on purpose what-whatever it
completely can't kiss you either Laura
kiss energy how about 10 second huh cuz
that gives up Medicare hey nothing good
luck ah do you want to get a haircut
yeah hey love you Hey back to the video
ok so to start off this look you're
going to part your hair on the side just
make sure it's a nice straight part
and then you're gonna take note the
front section keep that out but just a
little section right here
and just separate it
scratch that
so you're gonna take a section this big
pretty small and we're going to do a
regular braid
and then once you get down to the bottom
you can use a little elastic to hold it
into place
these ones I just got from my drug store
you want to make sure it's fast and nice
and tight so now we have this little
tiny braid what you're gonna want to do
is start to pull little pieces out just
to make it look wider so it's more
prominent if you guys have lighter hair
the braids are gonna show a lot better
and look a lot cooler my hair is all one
color so by stretching it out a little
bit it's gonna make it a little bit more
visible
like that next I'm going to do a
fishtail braid so I'm going to take from
here over I'm going to leave a little
bit of a space in between and then just
grab this section to make things easier
I'm just gonna put on my hair on this
side while I do the fishtail braid so
you're gonna split this section into two
pieces for those of you that don't know
how to do a fishtail braid I'll talk you
through the first couple steps I did
boost a fishtail braid tutorial like two
years ago if you guys want to check that
one out okay so you're just going to
take a piece from the left section and
cross it over into the other section
you see same thing with the other side
you just take a piece cross it over the
first section and put it into the second
section
so you're just taking a piece crossing
it over smoothing it and doing the same
thing over and over
I remember the first time I ever learned
how to do a fishtail braid I was laying
bed that was bored
they're gonna call us the masses I'm
totally sorry um yeah so I was laying in
bed and I was bored and I didn't think I
knew how to do it and I was just laying
that anyone have a mirror and I just did
it and when it was finished I was like
wow how the heck did I even do that ever
since then I've been in love love
fishtail braids they just are a little
time-consuming but once you get the hang
of it it's literally so easy
okay and you're just gonna do it to
about there and take another elastic and
we're gonna do the same thing we're
gonna loosen this fishtail braid up a
bit the good thing about this look is we
want to look a little messy you don't
want it to be like sleek cuz I think
messy braid looks just so much better
it's gonna look something like this
again feel free to make it as thick as
you want by just kind of loosing it up
pulling some strands out to give it a
nice messy look like that so next we're
just gonna put all this to this side and
do a big braid for this braid you can do
a fishtail braid if you want but I'm
just gonna do a regular braid cuz with
the extensions and everything I think it
looks really pretty
this piece we're going to leave out
along with a little bit of my bang and
then the rest I'm going to braid into
the back braid so we have three sections
and I'm just gonna grate it
we're using another elastic to secure
the bottom I like using these little
ones because you don't really see them
next I'm going to pin this little braid
into the back of this braid right here
you're going to start pulling out this a
little bit so it's more prominent I
didn't end up wanting to keep that front
piece out cause it's a little long so
I'm just pinning it and then you want to
do the same thing with this braid you
want to really stretch it out
I'm also going to do is just like pull
back here a little bit to loosen it a
little bit you can just pull out any
little hairs you have
so this is the final result hopefully
you guys can see it was my dark hair I
love this look it's gonna be a little
bit Messier in about ten minutes my hair
just messes itself up so it looks a
little bit sleek at this point but it's
really up to you guys how messy you want
it to look it took me under 20 minutes
to do it so this is great if you guys
want to stretch out not washing your
hair next today it's always fun to try
new hairstyles and see how you like them
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
please comment below what you guys want
to see next on my channel I love you so
much until next time I'll see you guys
