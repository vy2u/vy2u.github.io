there I see you on the other side hi
everyone thank you for watching so a few
days ago I had posted a video and a lot
of you guys were requesting this makeup
look and I wanted to put this together
for you guys so I chose the color
emerald because it is a very popular
color for this year and I personally
think it would look good on any color
eyes so there you brown eyes green eyes
or blue eyes I have seen a similar look
on a few other people with other color
eyes so that's how I know I think it
would look good so if you guys want to
try it out keep watching and I will show
you how I got it to prime my eyes I'm
going to be using this color tattoo by
Maybelline this one is emerald and you
can get this at any drugstore
I pray
you wear nothing but a smile and nervous
left
your dark blue cotton sheets
I've spent years it seems just wondering
the darkness came on that late
the highway
with my fingertips I trace on your
biscuit
say can Husby
you mean everything better not quite
words let me tell you all the things
that you become
headlights
I don't need no secrets I give up on
love
it's gone
for lip liner I'm using by Jordana
cosmetics it's called tawny and this
one's definitely on my favorites it's
only $1.99 and I already outlined my
lips before the tutorial started so
that's what I'm using for my lip liner
and for this look I'm going to be using
a nude lipstick I don't think any other
color would really look good with this
dark eye so I'm gonna be using myth by
Mac and then over that I'm going to be
using sugar rim by Mac also
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoy this tutorial I know a lot of
you were requesting this look after I
posted my previous video remember that
this eye look is not only good for
someone with light eyes I think it would
look amazing on any eye color whether
you have brown eyes green eyes blue eyes
anything like that because the emerald
really is like a great color that I
think would look good on any skin tones
even if you have like lighter skin tones
with blonde hair I would definitely try
it out do something a little outside
your comfort zone why not just play
around and see how it comes out so I
hope you all enjoyed this tutorial and
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
