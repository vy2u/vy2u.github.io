I'm going to show you how I got this
emerald smokey eye along with a huge
giveaway this has been so long overdue
so I do apologize that it has taken this
long but I wanted to make sure it was
the best giveaway that I've hosted yet
we are so close to three million
subscribers like any day now and I just
cannot believe it I'm so grateful for
every single one of you and it's
honestly mind blowing 3 million people
are subscribed to me to be honest I
barely ever leave my house so the
thought of 3 million people I don't know
it just hasn't really sunk in yet so I
just I'm so grateful for all of you and
I'm so thankful that you guys are still
enjoying my videos after all this time
so I wanted to put together this huge
giveaway for you guys I'm going to first
show you how i got this makeup look
because i've seen a couple people
requesting it from my previous video and
then at the end of the video i'm going
to announce the giveaway so definitely
stay tuned till the end of the video if
you want to see how you can enter hair
let's put on my face the whole time so i
hope you guys are excited I'm so excited
to announce this for you guys and I hope
you enjoyed this makeup look to start
off this look I'm applying stay don't
stray all over my eyelids this is going
to pry my eyes and help keep the shadow
on a lot longer then I'm picking up the
color golden olive by Mac and I'm
applying it all over my eyelids I'm
first wetting my brush with my fix+ to
help really bring out the pigment
next for my Too Faced palette I'm
picking up the color punk with a small
blending brush and I'm applying this on
the outer V of my eye I am using this
concealer because it has a straight edge
so it's going to give it a perfect smoky
eye just a little tip that you can use
to help get a straight line and then I'm
blending this color right into my crease
with a large blending brush I'm picking
up a tiny bit of that golden olive
pigment and I'm blending that in my
crease then grabbing the color new
romantic I'm applying this right
underneath my brows to highlight for
eyeliner I'm using my ink liner by Pat
Bundy
and then for lashes I am using my karlie
lash by the lower lashes I do have a 15%
off code for their website which I will
list below after I apply my lashes I'm
just going over my eyeliner to make sure
it's super dark then picking up the
shimmery brown color from colour-pop I'm
applying this on the lower lash line I'm
then grabbing a little bit of that same
brown color with my blending brush and
I'm blending that into the crease it's
going to give it a little bit of a
shimmery look once I do the lashes and
the eyeliner I like to go back in on my
eye shadow to make sure it looks super
pigmented so I'm just adding a little
bit more of that green pigment then
comes mascara I'm applying a little bit
on my upper lashes and then also on my
lower lashes to bronze up my face I'm
using the NYX contour kit
for blush I'm using a speech colored one
by NYX and I'm just applying that on the
apples of my cheeks
next for highlighter I'm using this one
by Revlon it was actually my first time
using it it's not too too pigmented but
it is from the jug store so I wanted to
try and incorporate some drugstore
products in this look so I'm just
highlighting my cheeks and also on the
bridge of my nose and then with the
grayer tone from the next kit I'm just
going over my nose contour and then for
lips I am using the color rose by Estee
Lauder and I'm just filling in my lips a
little bit and then over that I'm using
my Anasazi a Beverly Hills the color
pure Hollywood liquid lipstick along
with the colored lovely
and then to finish this look off I'm
using my mac fix+ in the new coconut
flavor

guys which I think this is a pretty nice
bundle if you ask me it's kind of a
little mixture of all of my favorite
products combined into one so I hope you
guys are excited for the prizes so now
it comes down to how to enter and it's
not going to be the usual comment below
and I will pick that way what I'm asking
you guys to do this time around is to
plant a tree so some of you may be like
we'll plant a tree that's kind of random
this is a makeup and beauty channel why
would we plant a tree I think if we can
all benefit the earth in some way it's
an amazing thing this giveaway is
worldwide so think about it if we get a
thousand people to enter this giveaway
that's a thousand new trees around the
world and some of you guys may think
that's a little bit silly but I see it
as a way to help add more oxygen to the
earth and I don't know I just think it's
a really cool idea so what I'm asking
you guys to do is to film a short video
of you guys planting a tree whether it
be at a park or in your yard or wherever
you want to plant it just the rules to
planting a tree I looked it up and it's
not as easy as going out buying a little
seed and throwing it in your yard you
need to make sure you are allowed to be
planning it where you want to plan it so
I looked up a couple websites and I'm
gonna list them all below that way you
guys can kind of check it out and see
how to do it so I'm just gonna go over
some of the rules with you guys because
I don't want anyone to get confused or
anyone to really get in trouble um I
found this website I'm again I'm gonna
link it for you guys and depending on
where you live it's going to be a
different tree so it could really be
anything that's gonna do well in your
area so they're saying to make sure you
think about your local climate you'll
need to think about the weather in your
local area before planning a tree to
make sure that you get a species that
will survive and thrive in your garden
or yard using the Plant Hardiness zone
scale it can help not only identify your
local climate but also the best types of
the best types of trees to plant so I
actually clicked it typed in my zip code
and it showed me what types of plant
will thrive in my area so again I will
link that for you guys if you want to
check that out I'm sure you guys have an
idea of what trees are in your area you
just look outside and see what they are
I looked up the prices and they go
anywhere from like three to twenty
dollars so yeah you guys have to
a little bit out of pocket to do this
but you'd be spending that $20.00 on
makeup or something anyways you have to
remember that this is doing something
really good for our earth and your
children and your children's children
will thank you one day so that is
something I wanted to also mention the
next thing you guys just have to check
is check your local laws for digging
holes and planting trees most
communities will have zoning laws about
trees and digging holes on properties
within its borders it's important to
check these laws to make sure that you
are able to dig and plant trees if not
the community may not only prevent you
from planting the tree but also forced
you to pay fines so I want this to be as
simple as possible for you guys if you
guys don't own the land that you live on
they definitely have some sort of park
around me where you can go and plant a
tree so what I'm asking you guys to do
is a little bit of homework for this
giveaway is to just google your area and
see if you're not a lot of plants on
your own property where you can go plant
if you guys are in the u.s. you can call
eight one one before you dig this will
get your underground utility lines
marked for free which will help to
prevent damage injury and fines so this
isn't going to be go out by tree and
just plant it without calling anybody
this is something if you are under 18 I
would recommend asking your mom or dad
to help you if you go to your local
nursery I'm sure you can talk to
somebody there and they can tell you
about the different trees that will do
well as well as where to plant them and
I know they have parks that you can go
and plant a tree as well as you aren't a
lot of plant in your own yard where for
us we're renting so if I wanted to plant
a tree I can't plant it anywhere on my
yard but I know there's a couple
different parks in my area that I can go
and plant the tree if need be so I just
wanted to let you guys know that this
may be a little bit harder than just
commenting on a video or doing that but
I figured since they are such great
prizes maybe they'll motivate you guys
to really get going with this
so all I'm asking you guys to do is film
a quick 15-second video of yourself and
post it either on Instagram or YouTube
and in that video just show yourself
planning the tree so it's really simple
also in the description box on YouTube
or on your Instagram video make sure to
write how your experience when um I hope
this isn't too much of a hassle for some
of you guys the whole meaning behind it
is really good and I hope we can get a
lot of new trees on our earth so I hope
you guys enjoyed it good luck to
everybody I will be
seeing what date that this ends down
below in the description box as well as
different websites you guys can check
out on how to plant trees as well as the
steps you have to take to enter the
giveaway so good luck to everybody I
love you guys so much I hope you enjoyed
this makeup look and until next time
I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
