sorry for the lack of videos this week I
was in New York City a few days for
Fashion Week and I just got so
sidetracked and I just really didn't
have any time this week so I wanted to
sit down today and some a video for you
guys I've seen this video requests so
many times so I figured I'd finally sit
down and talk about it because I have
literally tried a million different
techniques trying to cover up dark
circles underneath my eyes one thing
that you guys get to look forward to if
you don't have some dark circles is with
age they love to come out if you don't
get enough sleep or if you're out a
little bit late the night before they
just like to stand out even more so I've
literally tried a million techniques and
I found one that works great for me for
covering dark circles if you guys have
bags under your eyes disregard this
video because this is more to cover up
the darker purple or blue toned under
eyes so if you guys want to learn my
technique please keep watching so I'm
going to take off half of my under eye
that way I can show you guys the full
steps as to what I do so I'm just using
a wet wipe and I'm going to take off the
cake and demise
I just have my damp Beauty Blender and
I'm just gonna start dabbing under my
eyes just to get away any sharp lines
that I just erased but you could see the
big difference that I have from this eye
to this eye um to be honest this morning
my eyes were a lot darker um I had a
late night last night so the goal is to
get rid of that I also have darkness on
the sides of my nose that always makes
my nose look wider so it's kind of like
a whole process to highlight in contour
just to kind of fix your features so to
say so again I'm just taking this damp
Beauty Blender with nothing on it and
just kind of dabbing around where I
wiped off okay so step one is going to
be to apply an eye cream this one is by
Bobbi Brown it's the extra repair eye
cream this one is a bit pricey so if you
guys are on a budget just go and find
any sort of eye cream that's thick in
consistency because one of the problems
that I have is or that I had in the past
was when I was trying to cover my dark
circles it would look really really like
spotted and dry looking underneath my
eyes and I've never knew what it was I
figured it was either too much powder
too much product like I don't even know
but by adding eye cream before
everything it's going to really help
keep your eyes moist your eyes and it's
going to be a nice base for the product
that you're about to use okay so you're
going to damp that on so the next step
is going to be primer this one is the
Smashbox
color correcting primer to be honest um
I don't think there's a huge difference
if you're going to be using this primer
it is a salmon color and it's supposed
to help with color correction but when
you put so much product over it it
really kind of cancels it out and it
doesn't do a huge difference so if you
don't want to buy the color correcting
primer don't think that this is a
necessary step I'm just going to be
using it just to show you guys so I want
to dab that underneath my
as well
and if I were doing my whole face I
would obviously apply the primer all
over my face not just underneath my eyes
so there are no sharp lines I'm going to
take a little bit of my foundation that
I used the Chanel and number 40 and I'm
applying a little bit to my Beauty
Blender that's also damn and I'm going
to just start dabbing right around the
area you don't need to put this
foundation underneath your eyes because
you are going to apply concealer so it's
really just preference for you guys if
you prefer to put the foundation all the
way up which sometimes I do you can do
that but it is optional so next comes
the color correcting part this is an
orange concealer this one is from NYX
and it's bright orange I mentioned this
in my recent drugstore highlighting
contour video the orange really cancels
out the dark under-eye whether you have
like bluish or purplish tints I have
found that this really helps keep your
eyes looking nice and bright throughout
the day um some of you guys probably
realized that if you do your makeup and
you said it it looks really really great
but then after an hour - or a few hours
you start to see your dark circles
peeking through so what the orange is
going to do it's going to be a base for
the concealer so if the concealer starts
to fade a little bit it's going to pop
through and then cancel out the dark
shades if you guys have seen the
different color concealers there's green
there's purple there's yellow there's
orange they all do different things if
you guys want to bring up your dark
circles I recommend using a bright
orange like this or a coral color I
prefer the orange I'm just taking a
little bit on my brush this is the
Sephora airbrush concealer brush and I'm
applying it right where there's dark so
right along here is where I'm going to
apply it and only right here you don't
want to put it all under your eye you
don't want to put too much because if
you don't have the purplish undertones
it's going to look orange under your
concealer and it's going to do
absolutely nothing for you so again just
apply a little bit right under your
like that
and it's going to look silly at first
but that's gonna be covered so don't you
worry so next comes concealer I love the
laura mercier camouflage concealer I've
always loved it but it's a very dry
concealer so for most people it's really
hard to blend and it looks cakey after a
few hours I've recently stopped using
that and I switch over to a more liquid
concealer um the one that I was using
for the past few months is the pro
longwear concealer from Mac this one is
NC 20 and I absolutely love this one a
drugstore alternative that is absolutely
amazing it's another one of my favorites
is the Maybelline age rewind um dark
circle eraser this one's great and
another one that I just picked up last
week from Ulta is the it's cosmetics bye
bye under-eye this one I've been using
the past couple days and I actually
really really loved it so this is going
to be the one I'm gonna use in this
video but again just feel free to use a
concealer that you prefer I recommend
using a creamy one if you have the
darker circles because it's kind of a
few layers that we have to apply to
really keep the under-eye super bright
and locked in for all-day coverage so
I'm just taking it a little bit and I'm
applying it right on the back of my hand
and I'm using my Mac 287 brush to blend
that in underneath my eye and I'm just
taking a little bit on my hand and
dabbing it like this and I'm going to
start tapping it underneath my eye right
over the orange and just right under my
eyes
and then I like taking my damp Beauty
Blender and just pressing it in a little
bit more and I'm just very lightly
pressing
so before i started using the laura
mercier translucent setting powder I was
using the brightening powder I'm not
exactly sure the name of it but I
actually just ran out of it yesterday I
got every last bit out of it and then I
had to throw it away so I moved on to
the translucent setting powder you want
to make sure you're using a translucent
powder or something that's really really
fine because if you use the wrong type
of powder that's what's going to really
dry up your under eye so I'm just taking
some on my damp Beauty Blender and
putting it under my eye and this is
going to help prevent creasing and it's
going to help keep it on all day I have
little creases underneath my eye and
they just won't ever fully go away so I
just like to draw a nice faded line
underneath my lower lash line and that
really covers up those wrinkles that
just concealer won't cover up alone so
now I set it with the powder and you can
see it just has a nice flawless finish
it doesn't look really like gooey and
shiny like it just previously did so the
next thing that I do is I take a pressed
powder that's a little bit of a fuller
coverage this one is by Revlon I love
this powder it's a great powder you can
get it right from your drugstore other
patterns that I love are the Mac
mineralize skinfinish sounds really
great as well but this one works just as
good so I wanted to show it to you guys
I'm using the Mac 227 brush and I'm
taking a little bit on my brush just
dabbing it on and then I'm going to be
placing it right underneath where you
could still see that line like right
here I'm going to press it in
so that is the final step for setting
the dark circles underneath your eye I'm
just going to fix my blush and bronzer
so I'm all even and I look like I didn't
wash off half of my face but I found
that's the best way to really cover up
those dark circles and keep them covered
all night so this is the final result I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
hope you learned something new if you

tricks work for all of you guys I swear
