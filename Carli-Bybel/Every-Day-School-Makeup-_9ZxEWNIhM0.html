going to be showing you how I got this
very simple everyday makeup look a lot
of my younger subscribers have been
asking me what I would do for a normal
day-to-day basis if I were going to
school well I'm not in high school
anymore but this look is very natural so
it's good for adding age also if you
don't really like makeup or if you're
not into a lot of makeup you can also
try this look so I hope that you guys
like this and thank you again so much
for watching first I'm going to be
applying L'Oreal magic smooth souffle
all over my entire face using my Mac
dual fibre brush it's really important
to use a good brush when applying your
face makeup so it gets in every little
crevice and besides I know a lot of
people who use their hands and if you do
it that way it's not gonna stay on very
well while doing this you also want to
make sure you get your neck that way you
don't have any sharp lines and it
matches perfectly
to add some color I'm going to be using
True Match by L'Oreal and also a brush
by Mac and I'm just gonna be applying
this right on my cheekbones when
applying the bronzer I like doing it
just around my face because that way it
kind of contours your face and it makes
your face appear thinner I don't like
when bronzer is all over the face just
too much for me
you're then gonna want to apply the same
color around the sides of your forehead
and also the sides of your nose make
sure after you do this you also add it
to your neck that way it does match as
well
I'm then using my Maybelline liquid
concealer to cover up any pimples that I
have it does give it a lot of coverage
you're just gonna want to Pat the area
I'm next taking a concealer just to
cover up the dark circles underneath my
eye if you don't have these under your
eyes feel free to skip this step
you're also going to want to apply this
concealer on your eyelids that way your
eyeshadow last all day for school
I'm then taking this L'Oreal eyeshadow
and I'm applying this right on my eyelid
I'm using the color that's a little bit
more of a peachy color
I'm then taking this light brown sparkly
color and applying it right in the
crease with my Mac blending brush you
just want to do this very lightly
next I'll be using the champagne color
and applying it right in the tear duct
of my eye and also on my brow bone
for mascara I'm using L'Oreal telescopic
this really makes your eyelashes become
a humungous I highly recommend this
mascara
I'm then using my Mac mineralized blush
and I'm applying this with another Mac
brush all over my cheeks
going back to the same L'Oreal colors
I'm going to be using the lighter one
and applying it right on the Cupid's bow
of my lips I couldn't buy my chapstick
so I'm gonna be using lip balm it's just
a clear gloss and it tops off the
natural makeup look this look is perfect
again for an everyday school look I hope
that this helped out a lot and keep
watching for some bloopers hi how are
you so a lot of my Emer
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
