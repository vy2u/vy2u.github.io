morning I posted on Twitter and Facebook
what you guys wanted to see and the
number one requested video was a quick
easy every day summer look so I figured
instead of just doing an everyday summer
look I would do something that you can
do in under ten minutes it took me about
nine minutes and 45 seconds to get this
whole makeup look done so this is
perfect for those of you guys looking
for something easy quick and affordable
because everything I use is from your
drugstore so if you guys want to learn
how I got this quick makeup look just
keep watching okay guys so I am putting
on my timer that way I'm making sure
that it's under 10 minutes I'm applying
this Rimmel BB cream all over my face to
give myself a little bit of a glow a
mixing in the self illuminator and I'm
applying that just a little bit on my
cheeks my forehead and on my chin and
then I want to blend it in with my BB
cream since we are using the BB cream we
don't need to use a primer which is one
of my favorite things about the BB
creams and also it's really lightweight
on your skin so with the warmer months
ahead of us I love using a BB cream as
opposed to a foundation because it just
feels a lot lighter on our skin and with
this humid horrible heat we don't want
anything caked on so after I just
blended it in I'm using my damp Beauty
Blender to just make sure everything is
looking
even and smooth and all that good stuff
and every time I say damp Beauty Blender
I'm saying damp not damn I always see
people commenting saying oh it sounds
like you're saying damp Beauty Blender
well I'm not I'm sorry but every time I
say it now that's what I think of all of
you guys correcting me so it is the damn
Beauty Blender which just means I am
rinsing it underneath my faucet I am
bringing it out and it's still super
damn
you
so now that I'm finished blending I'm
going to grab my concealer and of course
I dropped it under my chair and it took
way too many seconds to pick it up so I
was really stressed at this point but
I'm deceasing my maybelline concealer
I'm applying a little bit underneath my
eyes and between my brows tiny bit on
the bridge of my nose and on my chin and
then I'm just blending all that in with
my Beauty Blender so normally when I'm
editing my videos I always speed up this
part but I wanted to keep it at the
actual time that I was doing it so hope
I'm not boring you guys with all of this
extra footage but I just wanted to show
you that really to take me under 10
minutes and it's perfect for those of
you guys that are in a rush or at work
or you get up early and you just want to
throw yourself together really quickly
so I hope you guys don't mind and I hope
you can follow along with me and try
this routine out and save yourself some
time in the morning because what's
better than sleeping that extra 10
minutes
so now we're moving on to brows I'm just
combing them up and then I'm filling
them in with my elf eyeshadow eyeshadow
eyebrow palette I've actually never used
this one before it has like a cream side
and then a regular powder side so it
actually works pretty good at camera
eyebrows looking super natural which for
this look I think is perfect fill in
your brows how you normally would I'm
just trying to make them even so this
took me a little bit longer than maybe
it should have
you
so now I'm using this hard candy
three-in-one I guess bronzer blush and
highlighter I'm using the bronzer shade
to bronze up my face a bit normally as
I've said in previous videos I'm a lot
Tanner so I wouldn't even need as much
bronzer but I'm just super PC so I'm
just trying to apply some bronzer to
warm up my face
you
and I'm just grabbing a smaller tapered
brush that same bronzer color and I'm
going to be contouring my nose a little
bit
I cannot go a day without contouring my
nose so this part again is optional
depending on if you like your nose
contoured or if you don't if you don't
then this will save you a couple minutes
maybe like a minute but I'm just
applying a little bit and it's gonna
look a little harsh at first but you'll
see what I do is just gonna blend it out
and it's very very subtle nothing like I
usually do but I just need a little bit
of contour my life I'm extending my nose
contour into the creases of my eyes just
to give it a little bit of depth to
really open up my eyes and again this is
still that same bronzer color so I'm
really using the steering one for
basically everything which is great
because the less products better
then I'm just taking my damp Beauty
Blender and just kind of blending in
wherever there were any sharp lines now
since we did apply concealer we want to
set that concealer so I'm using my
Revlon pressed powder first I'm just
blending out any creases that I have and
then I'm just patting on that powder
just so it doesn't move anywhere and
it's also going to get rid of any of the
under-eye creases and it's prevent it
from just coming off in a couple hours
so the powder is very important I know
some people like to skip the powder but
I recommend a little bit of the pressed
powder just so it's going to really seal
up your makeup and help keep it on as
long as possible
and with a larger fluffy brush I'm
applying the peach colored blush and
this is just going right on the apples
of my cheeks
moving on to lips I am lining them with
this Jordana lipliner I actually just
opened this one today and off the top of
my head I don't know the name of it but
as you guys know I always list
everything on my blog as well as in the
description box so I will list that for
you guys and then I'm applying this NYX
lipstick the next lipsticks aren't
pretty good they're not super super
pigmented but they're really like creamy
so it's good because it's gonna
moisturize your lips so whenever in
lipstick you guys decide obviously you
can just throw it in your person then
reapplying it throughout the day but
this is just the one that I wanted to go
with today and I'm applying that
highlight shade all over my eyelids it
is so pigmented and it's such a gorgeous
champagne color so I literally didn't
even need to put that much on and it
just came out like perfect on my eyelid
so I'm also applying a little bit on my
Cupid's bow and then I'm also applying
some on my cheeks because what's better
than look super glowy and dewy for the
summertime
and the next comes mascara it's so funny
because I've seen a couple tweets and
comments and people who are always
saying like the day you use another
mascara hell will freeze over so I just
thought it was so funny because it's
literally the only product that I've
never changed throughout I don't know
six seven years now so this mascara is
literally light and it's so great
because everyone who said that they've
tried it they have loved it and it's
been there any favorite so it's just the
one that gets my lashes super long and
thick at the same time and yeah I don't
know I just can never switch over so
maybe one day I'll invent my own mascara
with similar wand and then I'll switch
over but until then L'Oreal telescopic
is my one and only
with my pencil brush I'm applying a
little bit of that bronzer color
underneath my lower lash line just to
kind of open up my eyes a bit
and then I'm taking a tiny bit of that
highlighter putting on the bridge of my
nose and then I'm finishing off this
look with my NYX setting spray and I did
this whole look in nine minutes and 49
seconds so yeah it can be done don't
think it can't be done I hope you guys
try this out and enjoy it for yourselves
so this is the final result it's been so
long since I've actually time myself
doing makeup so it was a little
stressful trying to get it done but I
got everything done in under ten minutes
so this look is perfect for those of you
guys who don't have a lot of time in the
morning for those of you on a budget and
for those of you that are looking for a
really lightweight but yet pretty makeup
look so I hope you guys enjoyed and
until next time I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
