hi everyone thank you for watching two
videos ago I had mentioned that I've
been using a couple new products to fill
in my brows and I think the last video
that I had posted that was dedicated to
just eyebrows was probably almost two
years ago now so I think it's time for
an update I wanted to go step by step
just showing you how I fill in my brows
and of course depending on how much
makeup I'm wearing will also depend on
how much powder and everything I'm using
but for today when I have a full face of
makeup these are how I do my brows so if
you guys want to learn how I do them
please keep watching a few months back I
picked up my anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow and this is in the color dark
brown and ever since I've been using
this on my brows I swear I cannot go
back to just the powder what I like to
do is take an angled brush and I like to
outline where I want my brows to be so
I'm just going to be using a tiny bit on
my brush I'm going to slowly draw in
where I'm going to eventually fill in my
brows on the other side of this brush it
has a little comb to comb your eyebrows
up so in between doing my brows I'll
continuously comb it up
when I get to the hairs closest to my
nose I always turn the brush and I draw
straight lines just so it looks more
natural and it looks more like your
actual hair but I also like to do is I
always make my eyebrow a little bit
thicker than I would normally like it
and then as I go I'll just slowly slide
my finger and shape it and thin it out
you
these are the two brow powders that I
recommend the whitening lightening brow
bar I've been using forever and I love
the colors in it and this other one is
by Anastasia Beverly Hills as well and
it is also in the color dark brown and
what I do next is I just fill in my
brows and I just fill in any spaces that
look lighter and again you just need to
use a little bit of the product and
slowly add it on and when you get to the
hairs closest to your nose remember to
flip your brush and do vertical strokes
once I've gotten them almost perfectly
even I then use my brow gel and this is
just a clear brow gel this one is by
Anastasia Beverly Hills they do have a
few that I've used from the drugstore
that are just as good and the brow bar
to go has a little gel that you can
apply as well anything that just hold
your hairs in place and make it look the
most natural
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video remember when a
full face of makeup I think filled in
brows really finish off the look
especially for someone like me with dark
hair because once you put the foundation
and everything over your natural brows
it tends to lighten it up so I don't
know I'm just in love with big brows I
always have been so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video hopefully learn
something new and until next time I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
