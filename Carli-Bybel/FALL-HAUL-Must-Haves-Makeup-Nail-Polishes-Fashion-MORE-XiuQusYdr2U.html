me
I can change I can change you hi
everyone thank you for watching so it's
been quite a bit since I've done a haul
video or a favorites video so I'm just
gonna go through a bunch of products
that I've recently purchased for fall
and share them with you guys it's gonna
be everything from fashion and now stop
makeup everything like that so if you
guys want to see what they are then
please keep watching
so as of lately I've seen a ton of
requests for different nail polish
videos or different nail polishes I'm
loving right now I know a lot of people
were asking about the color that I had
on my nails every time I go into the
drugstore I always love kind of mozuku
oh I don't have this color let me go and
get that color even though I usually
come home and half the time I have a
very similar color but there were a few
that I've picked up for fall and the one
that I have been wearing it in all my
recent videos is definitely my favorite
as of right now that one is by Essie
it's the ladylike and it's like a taupe
color I'm gonna say I don't even know
how to describe what color this is but
it's like really really beautiful some
of the other colors that I picked up
that I'm loving for fall the other Essie
ones are miss fancy-pants Bahama Mama
and smoke and Hodge so these ones are
beautiful and I know I'll definitely be
getting a lot of use out of them for the
Fall the three other colors that I
picked up two are actually no they're
all sinful colors is blue purple and
then the strawberry pink and these
colors again are perfect for a fall and
I can definitely see myself wearing them
ever since I took my tips off my nails I
felt so much better so much easier to
work with and I can't always paint them
myself I don't have to worry about going
anywhere to get them done even though I
normally painted them myself anyway but
yeah so for fall I think these colors
are awesome I think they would look
great and you can get them all at a
drugstore which is awesome because
they're all nice and affordable well I'm
still on the subject of nails I really
quickly wanted to just talk about this
awesome nail file that I've just
recently picked up and what's cool about
these is you can peel
so once it starts getting dull you peel
it and there's another layer and I
believe there's about other six in one
file which is awesome because I hated
filing my nails because they get so dull
so quickly and you have to go out and
buy a new one so these are awesome
because they're just peel backs and then
you can just reuse them so again these
ones are by Revlon you can get them at
any drugstore and I highly recommend
them this is my third time buying one of
these next I'm going to talk about some
lipsticks and lipglosses that I've been
using a ton the color that I'm wearing
right now and the color that I use in my
previous Tinkerbell video which happened
to get cut off for some strange reason
is the new color your smile and nude
these ones used to come in a couple
different colors that I talked about but
this new color is so awesome because you
don't need a lipstick with it it's very
pigmented this one is called nude and
these ones are cool because they have
the mirror on them and they also have
the UV light if you can see with all
these lights everywhere but yeah this is
definitely one of my favorite nude
glosses for the fall time basically in
general and not even just for the fall
but just came out not too long ago and
I'm loving it I also have a coupon code
for these glosses to get them 70% off so
I will list that below the next lipstick
is from Mac I'm gonna look for drugstore
alternatives to list on my blog for you
guys but I love this strawberry color it
goes really really well with this
strawberry colored nail polish that I
got as well and I think this is going to
look great for the Fall you can do a
very basic eye and then use a nice
bright color and it's a little bit
different than the normal red and it's
not a hot pink it's like a little bit of
mixture of both so I really really love
this and the last lipstick I believe
might also be limited edition as well
from Mac but I saw this and I fell in
love with it and it was so funny because
this one's called feed the senses but
when I got home it was the exact same
color as my lady like Essie nail polish
which was awesome so I'm thinking of
doing maybe a tutorial using the polish
this one and then I have a cool I shadow
that matches so I'm loving this color
for a fall a few months ago I picked up
this clean and clear acne spot treatment
and I've been using it for every time I
got a pimple which the
pretty covered right now but last week
I've got a few pimples that were pretty
nasty but this stuff really really
drives it out along with the astringent
that I've mentioned in previous videos I
use that and then this and it really
dries out pimples fast I also use this
if I ever get ingrown hairs because
sometimes when I shave I get ingrown
hairs because my hair is naturally curly
so I like to use this as well and it
helps get out those ingrown hairs and
get rid of all your pimples another
favorite right now is this take me to
Brazil palette from BH I've used this in
all my Halloween makeup tutorials so far
because it has every color that I've
needed and they're so highly pigmented
and honestly when I'm filming videos
it's pretty hard to have a million
different products laid out because I
use like this little chair in front of
me
so this palette has been such a blessing
the past couple times and I believe it's
only 1995 I will list that below as well
but the colors are awesome they're great
they have some great fall colors and
they're also really bright amazing
colors for Halloween for summer for any
occasion so I do highly highly recommend
this palette so really quickly the next
products I'm going to mention that have
been an all-time favorite for ever now
and if you guys want to see it in use I
will link the video where Brett actually
does use it but I've been mentioning
this forever the diol smile kit and I
have a coupon code to get it for only
$59 and this is what I use about once a
month to whiten my teeth and I still
back this up a million percent and now
I'm seeing it all over the place which
is so exciting because that means it's
really working for everyone and I love
hearing your feedback and I know it's so
amazing that's why I just wanted to
quickly mention it again because I back
this up a hundred percent the dial of
smile and also by them the brow bar to
go I use this in a ton of my videos I
just use this in the contour video I get
so much use out of this I use it for my
brows to contour everything like that so
these products have been in my drawers
for over two years but I just always
have to mention these in my favorites
because they're my favorite right so
let's move on to some fashion and stuff
like that so these gloves
are so fabulous first ones have some
awesome pleats on it which for fall this
year these pleats are everywhere and
they're everything
I just got a nice leather jacket to
match with the same pleats so I know
I'll definitely be getting some use out
of these they're both from ASOS so
they're both affordable I will link
everything below these para awesome
they're all black with a white leather
thumb which is an pinky which is so cool
they're so different and I love these
and I really never owned gloves before
so I'm actually excited to try these out
so I've always been a huge fan of black
clothing I mean who is and I think it
looks the best in everybody but this
year for fall I'm seeing black and white
trends everywhere and I'm loving them so
I was going through some of my new stuff
that I was getting and I was like what
can I show in the video and I picked out
four different black and white sweaters
because obviously I have a thing for
black and white sweaters this year so I
just really quickly was going to show
you each one this one is like a comfy
little plant sweater with some red
accents and I love this I think it's
gonna be so comfy and sweaters in the
fall or everything you can just throw
them on a pair of jeans and a pair of
boots and you just look awesome and well
put together so I'll definitely be
getting a lot used out of that this one
I love it's a sweater also it's from
forever 21 so it was very inexpensive
these checkered prints are everywhere
and I'm in love with this and when I saw
this it was only nineteen dollars so I
mean you can't really beat that but I
love it it's nice and big and baggy so I
think this I could even wear with a pair
of leggings and boots the next black and
white is this adorable poncho from Zara
and I love the houndstooth print and I
really love Poncho's I think they're
amazing and awesome and perfect to throw
over an outfit when you're just running
out the door and the final black and
white sweater yeah clearly I like black
and white I mean look at my shirt but
the last black and white sweater is all
from asos and it has this really really
pretty print on it and yeah so I'll
definitely be wearing a lot of black on
my sweaters this year I really love the
whole black-and-white trend I think it's
awesome and I think it's a little change
out of the whole black trend that I've
been obsessed with for the past few
years the next thing I'm gonna show you
is if I don't know if you guys saw my
fall fashion video where I did the
matching separates trend in that
adorable deep cranberry outfit but I got
something it's pretty similar also from
ASOS it's this cute little top with the
zipper in the back and then it comes
with a pair of shorts again with the
zipper in the back so I thought this was
so cute and I am obsessed with matching
separates which I'm sure you guys can
tell but yeah I figured this with a pair
of stockings and a pair of boots like I
paired my other outfit will look so cute
and I definitely will be wearing this in
the winter time slash fall time the last
item I'm gonna be sharing with you today
are these insanely fabulous shoes you
see these I still have like the plastics
up on them but these are Jeffrey
Campbell and I know they're like a
knockoff of Isabella Moran
sandals but they are so adorable and
they just came out so I'm sure I'll be
wearing them in the spring / summer time
but it's still a little warm in New
Jersey so maybe I'll get some use out of
them now I don't know as soon as I saw
them I fell in love and they're just so
fabulous I could picture myself wearing
these with so many things I can't wait
to wear them so I guess for now actually
wait no
make sure you one more thing one more
thing so knee-high socks are amazing I
did a post I'm gonna say two weeks ago
with the black ones from ASOS but I just
got these ones from Nasty Gal they're
like open those
see them they're like these white fluffy
knee-high socks and I thought these
paired with short and like a nice long
sweater would look awesome and yeah I'm
really into the whole knee-high socks
short sweater look this year so I'm
probably gonna be doing a couple more
fashion videos soon and I'm sure in one
of them I'll be wearing them but yeah I
think that's really it for now for my
big fall haul if you guys like these
types of videos let me know because I
don't really do them that often but I
saw a bunch of requests recently and
especially for the nail polishes and
stuff like that so I hope you guys
enjoyed and definitely go check out my
blog because I'll be listing where I got
everything as well as cheaper
alternatives for those who like the
items but maybe don't want to spend the
money I hope you guys enjoyed this video
