today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this fall makeup look it took me
probably like 25 30 minutes it was super
quick and I also have an announcement to
make if you guys are not calling me on
social media I am having a pop-up shop
in New York City next weekend the 14th
and the 15th which is a Saturday and a
Sunday and you guys will be able to shut
my collection before it goes on sale I
will list the address the times and all
of that below but the shop will be open
a full day and I'll be there for about 4
hours and we'll have a photo booth and
gets me and hung and I just can't wait
so if you guys are in the area please
come by I would love love love to meet
you and you'll be able to see my entire
collection again and shop it before it
goes on sale so all those details are
listed below as well as the winners from
the face your fears giveaway and if you
guys want to see how I got this glittery
gold eye and dark berry lip makeup look
then please keep watching to start off
this look I'm grabbing this light matte
shade with my Sigma e-40 and I'm going
to be applying that right into my crease
so what I really wanted to do for a
tazed look was keep the eyes pretty
simple and then do like a bright like a
cranberry lip and I wanted to wear one
of my new outfits from my misguided
collection so I was inspired by the
color of it and I really wanted to do
lips to match so next with my finger I'm
just gonna pick up this gold highlight
shade and I'm just gonna dab that right
onto my lid no obviously you could use a
brush if you want but I'm trying to keep
it simple today
and a little bit of pop I'm gonna use
the Inglot Pigman in number 121 it's
like a beautiful gold Sparkle color with
my morphe m1 70 - 4 I'm going to dip my
brush into some setting water and then
I'm going to apply this color right over
the gold on my lid
I'm not going like too high up just
right on the lid and right below the
crease with my 8:45 I'm picking up a
little bit of this darker matte and I'm
applying that also in the crease right
above the shimmer shade just to add a
little bit of depth
you can mix in a little bit of the
lighter matte as well I'm just like very
lightly applying this that way I can
just shoot my eye a little bit and then
with my e 25 I'm using the lighter brown
matte to just blend above I'm just gonna
bring the matte shade down a little bit
further on my lid
then I'm going in with this em cosmetics
liner
I'm using these WSP Christina lashes and
I'm just gonna cut them in half and
apply it just on the ends like this one
I like to keep the short end and then
I'm going to cut off three large
sections and then three smaller sections
so this is what you're left with and
we're gonna apply that right on the
outer edge and this is my new tattoo I
have to go get it fixed because it's so
thin and fine that it started to fade
which happens with finger tattoos but I
wanted it super super thin so this
happened to my other tattoo as well so
with that same gold highlighter I'm just
gonna highlight under my brow and while
we're here let's highlight the nose why
not
picking up a little bit of this white
highlight shade I'm going to apply that
right in the inner corner going back to
the gold highlight shade I'm going to be
applying that right under my eye in the
center with my morphe e18 I'm picking up
the two matte Brown shades and I'm going
to be applying them on the outer and
also the inner under eye
I just realized I only had one earring
in with my buxom mascara I'm going to
apply a little bit on my lashes I don't
know if I want to do bottom mascara I
think I might just do like a little bit
I wasn't going to but I don't know I
don't know if I feel complete without
some bottom
to bronze up my face i'm using this
becca bronzer in capri coast i'm going
to go back with this gold highlighter
and just highlight a little bit on my
cheeks
you don't like to too much so I'm just
like very lightly applying it so this
top is from my new clothing collection
do you see the color it's literally
amazing it is a little bandeau top and
then I have matching high-waisted like
sweatpants
that go with it they're super cute so I
wanted to wear this today and I wanted
to do like a matching lip so what I have
is my Kat Von D Vampira lip liner and
then sad girl liquid lipstick so I'm
gonna try and like mix the two and
hopefully they'll be close to the color
of my shirt and I actually just had this
little choker laying around in my closet
so that ends up being really lucky I'm
gonna fill up my lips in a little bit as
well
and then we're going to go in with the
sad girl liquid lip it has a little bit
of like a shimmer to it
so I'm going to let this dry a little
bit and then I'm gonna go back in with
this liner just to make it a little bit
more red so I'm gonna apply a little bit
of the highlighter on my chest because
every time I wear like a low shirt like
this is something I'd love to do
there's left I'm using this one by Tarte
it's from it's like the pro palette one
so I don't know the exact name of it
I'll try and look it up it's like I'm at
pink cranberry ish color
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I hope to see
some of you guys at my pop-up shop next
weekend again all of the details are
listed below in the description box

love you so much and until next time
