missed you guys to start off this look
I'm going be using my new cover effects
primer it has some acne treatment in it
my acnes slowed down a bit but I figured
I would use it anyway for foundation I'm
using the graftobian warm palette I've
been loving this for a cream foundation
lately it feels a lot lighter on the
skin but it has a ton of pigment in it
and I'm just blending all of that in
with a damp Beauty Blender so bear was
watching my last video and he got a
little upset that I gave Cindy her
little cameo so you know he had to jump
in and start smacking me with his tail
and you know the typical bear stuff so
let's just let him have his moment here
he's a piece of work just look at those
little legs so moving on to nose I'm
using the beautiful bronze by la girl so
I'm just blending in my nose contour
with my fingers and then I'm grabbing
this artiste brush it's like a little
round one and I'm just smudging in these
sides a little bit next for concealer
I'm using my favorite creamy concealer
but when they were playing right
underneath the camera so I had to kick
them out right after this but I am
blending all of that in also with my
Beauty Blender this is my favorite
makeup tool hands down so originally I
was planning on doing my Salina hair
makeup outfit for Halloween video and I
am filming that tomorrow but I can't
find my Bellamy bangs so they're over
nagging me a new pair because I have a
hair idea in mind obviously so I just
want to make sure that it's perfect so I
will be filming that for you guys
tomorrow
and then to set underneath my eyes I'm
using the Cameo powder by Ben Nye to
film my brows I'm using the Anastasia
brow Wiz in the color evany and
following that I am using the brow
powder also in Ebony to fill them in a
little bit darker
so I just realized my Kat Von D
foundation powder book broke from my
long trip back but I'm still going to
use it it's alright it still works
so I'm just applying this on the sides
of my nose this is to set the concealer
elsewhere I don't like using the loose
powder further than underneath my eyes
and in my opinion it covers better and
just makes it look a little bit more
flawless so picking up my Kat Von D
shade and light palette I am using the
gray or tone and I'm going over the size
of my nose I know at this point it looks
a little bit crazy but I'm going to tone
it down a bit don't you worry so I'm
using a little bit of a darker Kat Von D
foundation shade and then I'm picking up
that peachy tone from the shade and
light palette just to go over it to kind
of diffuse it a bit so since I'm gonna
do a pretty simple I look and by simple
I just mean like very few steps I know
some people were like this is not a
simple eye makeup look and I'm not
saying like simple as in the huge winged
liner isn't crazy or anything but simple
as and I'm just using my bronzer for the
shadow and I'm keeping it really just
easy on the eyes as far as shadows so
that's what I meant by simple on my
Instagram post so I am just using a big
fluffy blending brush and blending that
in I'm using the middle shade and a
little bit of the darker shade and feel
free to use as much as you want but I
just wanted to add a little bit of depth
into my crease
for liner I'm using this one by TARTA is
my favorite I wanted to do like a super
dramatic wing since I was only gonna do
one color for eyeshadow I wanted to do a
little bit of a thicker or longer wing
than usual so that's what I'm going with
today I like to do it in steps and
listen like eyeliner I'm still not
perfect at it it's hard it takes time
just got to be a little bit patient with
it but if you're not patient and you
screw it up I have a little trick for
you guys I tend to do this all of the
time I have these pointy q-tips I put
them underneath my makeup wipe and then
I just very lightly clean off wherever
the eyeliner is messed up four lashes
I'm using my favorite lashes the WSP
these ones are the Christina lashes they
come in a six pack for like 15 bucks so
they're definitely just as good as the
red cherry ones they're basically the
same in my opinion so faux freckles how
did this happen it was kind of really
random and I tried this out last year
for Halloween I filmed a Twiggy video
last year for Halloween and I just
absolutely hated how it came out and
even brought was like a girl that does
not look cute so I just never ended up
posting the video so that was the first
time that I tried out faux freckles and
I didn't love it but I thought it was
like a cool idea so I'm doing the
freckles a little bit different today
I'm first using this NYX micro brow
pencil it's like a lighter brown it's
like a medium brown but not as dark as
my ebony so I'm just gonna do some dots
like randomly around my face and then
I'm gonna do the technique that I did a
year ago I actually watched someone on
YouTube and that's how I learned I'm not
exactly sure who it was but I did not
make this up
just cut a little piece of this Vera
Mona color swatch cleaner and I'm going
to be dipping it in my Anastasia brow
pomade and I know this is super random
but when you blot it it kind of leaves
like little freckle marks so I'm just
applying a little bit onto my cheeks
about in the same area where I applied
the darker dots with the brow pencil and
then after this I'm going to go in with
the ebony micro pencil with just a
little bit darker and I'm going to
darken up some of the dots so for an
everyday look is this something I
recommend absolutely not it was
something different that I really wanted
to try I've seen a lot of people trying
out the faux freckles I tried it last
year and I absolutely hated it my plan
for today didn't really go as planned so
I figured you know what try it out I'm
gonna try something different so again I
think it's a really cool idea I think if
you guys want to try it out try it out
see what you look like with freckles but
again this is not like an everyday type
of thing I know some people were like
freaking out online saying like who
would ever do this it'll wipe right off
but this is what makeups about people
it's about trying new things trying fun
things and even if it's just for an
Instagram photo whatever you got to try
new things that's what makeups all about
and I want to apologize I'm talking I
don't know if you guys can tell I am on
like a bouncy ball because we moves our
computers so I'm like kind of going up
and down because when I talk and I get
really into it I'm like moving my hands
and it was my body around oh I wish you
guys could see me right now but anyways
moving on we're gonna put some bronzer
all over the face on the cheeks and then
we are going to go in with this blush
I've never used this blush before and my
brush was still a little bit damp from
cleaning them last night so I really did
not realize that it looks a little bit
not so blended but I honestly was trying
to be really like gentle on the cheeks
cuz I didn't want to wipe off any of the
freckles so I feel like overall I love
how this look came out I just wish I
would have blended that blush
a little bit more for lips i'm using the
Kylie lip kit true brown K liner and
then I wanted to use this mellow
cosmetics chocolate lipstick underneath
the liquid lipstick because it's a
little bit of a darker tone so I applied
that first and then I'm using true Brown
k over it I can't go a day without
highlighting my nose so I didn't want to
cover the freckles too much so I just
applied a little bit right on the tip
and then a tiny bit right at the top on
the bridge and I'm also applying this
highlight shade right into the tear
ducts of my ass to finish off this look
I'm using the skin Inc serum setting
spray it's absolutely amazing and yeah
so that is it that is how I created this
look it's nothing crazy I know I look
weird I didn't apply a bottom mascara
crazy right but thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you enjoyed this
video and until next time I'll see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
