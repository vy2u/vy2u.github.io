cranberries theme my first outfit I'm
wearing cranberry colored stockings
matched with a pair of black highway
shorts a black tank some black booties
and then this amazingly comfy sweater I
have all of the outfit details along
with links on my blog so I will be
linking that all below for anyone who is
interested so to be completely honest as
much as I love this whole outfit and
getup
if I were going to a Thanksgiving dinner
I probably have a flat pair of boots on
try to be more comfortable but I'm
probably gonna end up in sweatpants go
in my family's house but I think this
outfit is perfect for the fall and I
thought it was really cute and it went
with the whole theme
when
when you're lost I'll
look out the window and the day's up on
us now we don't know
I'm not sentimental but I try to be
honest there's a few things you should
know
for the second outfit I have a super
comfy cranberry sweater and this one is
from forever 21 as well and I love these
sweaters because not only are they so
inexpensive they're super warm and comfy
especially like a day like today because
it was so cold out here in New Jersey I
accidentally put on a dark navy blue
belt but pretend you don't see that
because I thought it was black inside
and then clearly on camera it's navy
blue but I paired it with this awesome
bag from ASOS and these new two-tone
boots that I got from goujian and
they're super affordable
so the finish of this look I'm using
sugarplum
by Milani and says dark plum color and
it's named sugarplum so it was obviously
made for me but I'm using both products
by Milani I'm using the lipstick and
sangria and then again the lip liner so
first what I like to do is outline my
lips and I like to shade in after I line
it and then I go with the lipstick just
a quick side note whenever you're using
a really dark color like this be careful
do it slow don't rush through it because
it's so impossible to get it off your
skin when your days long hold you up if
you don't feel strong light you wait
when the dog comes in when you're lost
I'll lead you wrong
and you're all set
just kidding can you imagine kill then
what I like to do is I like to just eat
my finger and then very lightly smudge
along the line
you want to make sure you wipe your
fingers we need days long hold you up if
you don't feel strong light you weigh
when the dog comes in when you're lost
I'll lead you
then I'm picking up this darker pink
color and I'm going to be applying that
as blush
if you don't be
Dogons in
just a quick side note this brush that I
just got from Sigma it's the f50 brush
is so amazing so thank you guys so much
for the suggestions to go out and try
Sigma because I am literally obsessed
their brushes are so amazing and I don't
know if my Mac Buster's are just really
old but these ones work so much better
so again thank you so much for the
suggestions and if anyone is interested
I do have a 10% coupon code for the rest
of November</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
