our room it's so cute so we're about to
go meet my family go get some food and I
got my little room key right here that's
gonna be my money for the week which is
nice so I'm signatures so we just got
back from the mustard station we didn't
meet any of our family members yet so
we're gonna go down I think times x-4 to
be really hard because the Wi-Fi you
have to pay for which we paid for it but
have the people my family don't have an
iPhone or iMessage so I don't know how
we're going to communicate that we're
going to try and find grandma and aunt
Zena and mum and everyone and you wash
the damn toilet it's like gonna suck you
into the ocean so loud
love your sky city good morning guys
it's around not really good morning it's
kind of good afternoon it's around 12
o'clock we are at our first day at sea
and it's still really really really cold
we were just out on the balcony and it's
snowing here sure so this is currently
our view I have snowflakes landing on
this camera right now I don't know if
you could tell but it's really cold I
did not bring enough warm clothes which
I knew that you're gonna have two days
at sea because I've done this cruise
before but oh so this is the makeup
vanity thank God they had this area
because it's perfect so I'm currently in
pyjamas Davids dark we're gonna go down
and get some coffee because we're really
tired my little cousins came knocking at
our door at like 9:00 a.m. and scared
the crap out of us so we were up and
then we go back to sleep a little bit
missed breakfast and now it's time for
coffee so see you guys in a little bit
hi guys so it's currently around 8
o'clock
I completely forgot it was Valentine's
Day when I was talking you guys earlier
but today was a pretty lazy day we went
for breakfast and then we we didn't get
breakfast we got lunch because they
weren't serving breakfast and then we
just walked around for a little bit we
played bingo with my mom and my grandma
and then we came back up and napped
again we were really tired today umm my
whole family's at a show right now and
we slept a little bit later so we're
going down now to meet them for some
dinner
the original Alfa that I had planned for
Valentine's Day was supposed to be at
like a t-shirt dress and on the model it
was a dress and when I tried it on
because I didn't try it on beforehand it
wasn't a dress it was more of a t-shirt
so my HelpOut was hanging out so luckily
I had a different outfit but for having
three bags you would think I'd have like
an insane amount of outfits and for some
reason I don't even think I have enough
for the whole cruise so I may have to go
shopping I'm ready to get
look so handsome up wait let's see the
new shoes looking good
and then this door that keeps swaying
open and shut so my name is bodysuit I
think it's from Misha collection and
then I'm just wearing these wide leg ISO
pants I feel like I've wear them all the
time they're just like my Savior pants
hi we're about to go to dinner oh I have
a little mini munch a poopoo here and a
blonde did you go see the show broke how
was it and a birdie who is the birdie
what are you drinking I'm just I'm apple
juice some pineapple juice looking at
Colin hey hottie topic that was - hey
guys so we walk in and we get our first
animal it's a little elephant why hi Eli
hi guys so it's currently around 7:30 on
Monday we are heading out to dinner in a
little bit or having Asian food tonight
today was another day at sea and it was
still a little bit chilly so we didn't
do the usual lang by the pool and
getting super tan which I can't wait for
that because well overdue earlier today
Brett went to the gym and me and Danny
walked around we explored a little bit
and then we went and we went to the spa
and we went into the sauna and the steam
room which was so crazy it was really
nice I haven't been in a steam room or
anything like that in so long so we were
there for a few hours got ready and then
now we're off to dinner so I don't
really have much else to say except I'll
see you guys later loves you ready to go
yo come here with the end hey she was
feeling a little seasick before she
landed she'll eat dinner early good
poor poopy hey okay I don't hatch thingy
oh yeah where did you put it mother no
oh there it is okay so hopefully this
will help tried everything hey what are
you doing guys so we're getting ready to
go to dinner it is February 16th it's my
sister's birthday today I feel like I
haven't really been recording at all
during the day I don't worry I will
tomorrow and we're actually on the
island but today we were in Florida and
we decided to say on the ship because we
want to go to tan we wanted to lay out
the weather was absolutely beautiful so
we woke up we grab breakfast which today
was the first time that we actually made
breakfast because we've been sleeping in
I had breakfast we went to the pool and
we just laid out and got a little tan
which is nice and then we're going to
dinner now and probably the same thing
that we do every night we've been doing
dinner and then we gamble and we just
hang out and yeah that's about it so see
you guys in a little bit guys first time
I'm bringing my camera to dinner grandma
say hi
look how gorgeous Amanda's birthday
happy birthday color dress prettily
thumbs they're the mirrors on the
ceiling or iPhone 7 iPhone 7
Anasazi Beverly knows good like which
ones my brow which one hold up my brow
look now you it really was the same
exact size of it how many cut it now
right cue baby so we just finished in
iron a long ago beam in my shoulder who
wants oh wait come on come on birthday
girl look at the Mikayla if you love you
those kids with his stress pan
ladies look at recognize where did mine
come from then this is my outfit tonight
for dinner I'm obsessed with it but look
at this I had a pain get it steamed
because they don't have irons in the
room and I sat down at dinner and now
I'm all creased so I gotta change Oh
Carly asked me to take over that's the
pork we just left Canaveral this is the
same place where they launched NASA
rocket ships I'm pretty sure all around
us is all like these NASA bases where
I'm sure they do a bunch of research
basically everything it's really really
awesome really wish we could have left
the ship to do that but we didn't get a
chance obviously but we're leaving now
really peaceful this is my first cruise
so it's pretty cool um never really went
fishing or anything what my family
wasn't really big and fishing so I
always had a problem ocean sickness but
it's really been easy just anybody out
there who's afraid of that I wouldn't
really worry too much about it with
going on cruises because it really just
depends on the weather no different than
an airplane with turbulence you know
just normal and you get used to it after
a while and you just don't even know
anymore so don't want that you know
steer you away from enjoying a cruise
yeah
should I wear my shoes
no it's fun you're hot as you
I like to stand with my right hand
behind my hip and then direct with my
left hand
no not way go ahead do a quick outfit
change because those creases are just
not acceptable
we're gonna go gamble I was gonna do so
we just got back up to the room um we
went on a crazy mission because my mom
texted us she went up before us me and
Danny we're eating our pizza in the
promenade and grandma wasn't in the room
so we hadn't seen grandma in like three
hours we thought she had a bellyache
last we talked to her so we thought just
went up to the room so my mom went up to
the room she wasn't there texted us
freaking out saying grandma somewhere on
the ship um my thing missing and while
everyone was gambling the past couple
hours me and Danny were just kind of
walking around like just exploring and
we walked through the casino like 12
times did we see her we did not see her
at all so we were like she's definitely
on the casino so we I literally had
throughout my pizza not even eat in and
we went on a crazy mission in the
bathrooms like looking for her and then
we find her at the roulette table was a
huge stack of freaking chips and I
literally is a big like not a care in
the world like Oh what you're looking
for me for hey grandma okay so we all
get off to bed and grandma's still down
gambling it's like 1:30
she is my thirty little stay out she is
it dirty stabbed she's had to share that
with you guys so we just got back on the
boat I had over 23 snapchats of our
whole day and it all got deleted as soon
as we got back on the boat which really
bothered me because that's never
happened usually they'll stay like in
that red mode because you know I'm
service and they all deleted hi guys so
I'm wearing the same outfit that I
actually wore the first day on the ship
because we went to the buffet tonight
we're supposed to casual and this is my
casual outfit and sain is here Danny's
here what are we gonna go do gamble
drink ha ha hi what's cooking up nothing
much
um I don't really have much else to say
other than
there's the Atlantis hadn't been there
in so long used to go there all the time
with my family
headin up to the pool how many days left
we have three more days so I know I told
you guys that I was a little worried
that like a Nate's a vacationer than me
too much but it really hasn't been I
think it was like a perfect amount of
time because but time you get used to
the crew's supposed over like once we
figure out where everything is that'll
be the last day you guys got a CL
previous
so these are we just walked up steps
this is the floor it goes all the way
down I don't know if you guys can really
see but it's so high up imagine falling
through this that would stop this is
where we've been eating every morning
the wind Jim see if anyone's out here
I'm sure a lot of people got off one
Island today I don't wanna leave I would
not want to go in that it was broken the
first couple of days because this is the
boat that went through like the freakin
storm so there was like shattered glass
and so many things not working
it's just cool we just got back from the
pool feel like I got a little bit of a
tan it's such a gorgeous day it was not
too hot and it's a little bit chilly
with the breeze but it's nice because
when you're lying in the Sun the last
thing that you want us to be dying
that's sweat and heat we're gonna go
down and get some pizza and then we're
gonna shower get ready and we have
dinner again tonight and I don't know
where yeah I think when we're this
yellow dress because I kind of have a
tan now we're sailing away such a
gorgeous view imagine just waking up to
this beautiful high Bahamas you were
beautiful
we appreciate you
the city
I've been
apple tree
we're off to dinner we're eating at the
same so I literally just saw your text
when I had texted you back I was like
I'm sorry I thought you might laugh at
dinner and then she was able to do it
okay
hi we're off to dinner there's my
brother say hi rub look at his hair
skirt oh I wonder why hey little peacock
hi little frog doesn't shot Oh Danny
Raptors up to packet right I literally
it was like I don't know who he was what
was it and I go where's my dad back she
put in her manners okay
he puts rubber bands around it you're
probably guys tail but Isaac so doesn't
fall parts makes mom really wanted photo
hello okay what's your name here we are
we're still here we're still in Florida
basically we're how do you know where
the coast of Florida I mean I drew for
her see ya
oh oh yeah yeah yeah yeah hey guys so it
is Friday and we are at sea we are
headed back and we should be back by
Sunday we were hoping to get another day
in Sun but it's very chilly today it's
like 60 degrees in super windy so
earlier we went down got coffee gambled
a little bit and explored a little bit
and then we're going for massages in a
little bit and I just said a little bit
like 12 times
I found out say that they had a makeup
store on the boat which I'm glad I only
found out about it today because I
probably would've been there more but
they have everything tax free which is
awesome so it picked up another one of
those Lancome mascara it was 30 bucks
which is cool
what else do I have to tell you I feel
like this entire trip is just me talking
to the camera I haven't really brought
it around much I'm gonna take you guys
through the ship with my little DJ Osmo
thing it's a go
I got your own type thing that keeps it
super stable so I'll do that so you guys
can see the ship but to be honest this
is like my seventh or eighth cruise and
it was definitely not as good as the
other ones of course me and my family
and everyone had a great time with each
other but I think cuz of everything that
had happened last week they're
understaffed and they just keep running
out of everything and the people just
aren't as friendly I remember on the
other cruises that we would go on
literally everywhere you would go that
people would just be like hi how are you
yes and I was just so friendly and that
really makes your vacation so much
better and I don't know again I think
maybe because everyone got really
freaked out from last week it's just
been kind of blah and everyone's kind of
had like a weird added to it which is
not really cool because that makes the
whole vacation when people are friendly
and nice so Polly won't be back on
anthem of the Seas but I probably will
cruise again in the future
I'm just definitely not in February
because we only got three days in the
Sun and then now we have four days at
sea so just meet the full partner okay
you live and you learn
you had a great time though it was our
first time doing a big family vacation
everybody
we've been on vacation like ten ten
years ago probably like seven or eight
years ago but my grandparents weren't
with us so obviously Papa's not here
this is why we did the chip and we all
wish she was here but my grandma
actually played all his numbers on
roulette and won like three or four
hundred dollars the other night so that
was really exciting so we know Papa's
here with us um I don't know what else
to say we're gonna go for the massage
and then we have dinner I'm actually
wearing my favorite outfit tonight for
dinner even though it's cold but um yeah
oh I also plan on doing blog posts and
all that stuff and it's just by the time
you get up to the room and shower and
get ready I've literally
no time we're always late to dinner I've
no time to take any pictures which
stinks but um it's hard because when
you're at the pool all day you get
sweating you have to wash your hair so I
mean to have to blow-dry it and then do
your hair and then do your makeup and
you know how long it takes me to get
ready to go hopefully it's not too windy
out here but this is my view just the
ocean behind us
hey guys so we're getting ready to go to
dinner I'm wearing my favorite outfit so
far don't mind the mess everywhere but
it's red and white the blaze there's a
little big but too bad and try it on
beforehand I think at him so just know
where anyway I feel like this is oom din
so we're running late as usual we're
gonna run down now 737 Bret matches I
meet him where I didn't want to this is
the elephant the jacket stuff like too
big but you know what it's fine okay
it was already all out we look beautiful
hi boo the glare oh I got I caught you
hey hey Oh dr. sue queen you matched
today
okay sorry how cute we got sejuani's
tonight little swanee Lonnie's which
one's yours why love you I'm not allowed
to bring my camera into the casino so
that's really all we've been doing at
night I mean I only gambled one night so
far but we just kind of hang out on the
casino watch everyone else play and we
just walk around and that's really it
nothing crazy just a very relaxing trip
which is exactly what we needed we have
a one more night after tonight and then
we were back home I miss my little
babies and I miss the house and we have
so much more to do we have to get all of
our stuff out of our old apartment we
have one more week until our lease is up
and we still have a lot of stuff over
there so it's gonna be a little bit
crazy so going back to reality is it's
gonna be hectic but I'm ready for it
help me I have like a jack
and with my trim Danny
sick and chain
is a can
i watch the city
love to live
to let me stay
and I don't mind it if you require my
shake
hi guys so it is our last night I just
finished putting on some makeup we're
going to go to the buffet tonight I have
a lot of packing left to do I haven't
done any of money makeup or anything
else and we had a really great time so
I'm so glad that we got to do this and I
hope this blog isn't too boring I feel
like it's just me talking the camera a
lot of the time but I don't know we
didn't have that many days in the Sun
and we didn't get to really do much
which is completely fine because I
wanted to relax anyway but everyone had
a great time I hope you guys enjoyed
this vlog we are going to dinner and
then back to the casino for a little bit
I played for the second time last night
and I know I said this earlier but I
can't believe I won like that's the
first time ever not the first time one
time I won in Las Vegas I wanted
thousand dollars which was the most ever
but last night I was slaying and I do it
a little differently I just do two chips
I do it very slow right oh he says slow
and steady wins the race so that was my
theory last night and I ended up sitting
for like four hours so it was so much
fun I love you guys so much and I will
try and get a little bit more footage
but this might be close to the end of
the vlog so we can leave tomorrow around
8:00 technically but I don't think we're
gonna leave probably like 8:30 9:00 I'm
really really really excited to go home
and see the little babies I miss them so
much
Moo has been sending these snapchats cuz
she's been staying there and I'm just so
excited to see them I miss them and even
think that's really it for now so I will
