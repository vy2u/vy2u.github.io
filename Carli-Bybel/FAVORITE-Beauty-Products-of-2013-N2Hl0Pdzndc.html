hi everybody thank you for watching so
you may have noticed that I'm in a
different part of my room I just kind of
moved the camera over a little bit
because today I'm gonna be going through
a bunch of my favorite beauty products
that I found in 2013 and then I've been
using and loving so I'm gonna go through
everything from foundations nail polish
palettes brushes everything like that so
if you guys want to learn what they are
then please keep watching so first I'm
gonna be talking about the different
face products that I've loved the past
year in my previous video I had
mentioned the CC cream by Smashbox and I
saw a lot of you guys asking what it was
really for I also was using the BB cream
also by Smashbox and I was using this
the whole past year and the difference
between the two is not much but the BB
cream is a five and one it prime
protects perfects hydrates and controls
oil so that's what the BB cream is for I
love this in the summer time or if it's
really warm out instead of using a
foundation this is really light on your
skin and it looks really really nice in
the summer time and the CC cream it's a
little bit newer but I've been using
this when it's more cold out if I'm just
doing a nice casual look and the CC
cream it is the ultimate complexion
correcting cream it reduces the
appearance of dark spots and uneven skin
tone over time while you prime perfect
protect hydrate and control oil as well
so okay so the difference between the CC
cream is just a little bit better and
it's better for dark spots or if you're
a little bit older or anything like that
so there's not a huge difference in the
coverage I really don't see a big
difference but like I said I've been
using the CC cream when it's a little
bit colder out just because I don't know
my BB cream is my go-to foundation in
the summertime so these two are really
awesome I have tried a few different BB
cream brands but I think these two are
definitely when I narrowed it down to so
Smashbox BB and CC cream they're amazing
I love them and it's a nice light
coverage for any of you guys looking for
just something simple and very light on
your face
my two favorite foundations has to be
the magic nude liquid powder by L'Oreal
and the Makeup Forever HD foundation and
these two are definitely the ones that I
use the most I tend to do the HD
foundation
if I'm doing a more dramatic look and
this liquid nude powder is if I'm just
doing maybe like a daytime look and I
don't decide to use the BB or the CC
cream so this you can get right at your
drugstore or even on Amazon that's where
I get mine at and it's really really
awesome so this one is definitely more
affordable this one's a little bit more
pricey but if you guys are in the field
of makeup art Street I definitely
recommend trying the HD because I think
it looks so great on film and if you
guys are doing something for like a
wedding or anything like that this is
definitely the foundation to do so while
we're on the topic of face products I
also wanted to mention the L'Oreal
miracle blur and I think I mentioned
this in a previous favorites video this
I use either as a primer or if you want
to do like a no makeup makeup look you
can use this because it kind of just
blurs out your pores and it kind of just
looks like a nice matte finish on your
face so again you can use this as a
primer or just kind of an instant skin
smoother if you want a no makeup look my
favorite primer for 2013 is definitely
the photo finished color correcting
primer and this one I just renewed
because I had used that my other one
this one I love because it instantly
smooths out your face and if you have
some red spots which I tend to get it
just kind of gives you a nice perfect
slate to start on when you're doing your
foundation so this one is definitely my
favorite for the primer but sometimes
I'll just use the L'Oreal in place of
that so whenever I'm doing my face
makeup and I apply my concealer and
foundation I always like to finish with
a setting powder I go whoa
I go back and forth between the Make Up
For Ever HD powder and the mineral
finishing veil from Maybelline this
makeup forever powder actually came in
like a little kit I got from Sephora it
came with the foundation this and then I
believe it came with like a little puff
brush so I know they give you like a
little bit of a bundle deal if you guys
do want to try the products out and as
far as this translucent you can get
right out of drugstore I mean they're
both really great I go back and forth
like I said so whichever one is in my
grabbing view is the one I'll go for but
again if you guys are in the
professional makeup field the higher-end
HD products they really do make a
difference in my opinion especially on
film so yes
powders are everything you guys need
these because if you're using concealer
and you don't use a finishing powder
it's gonna just kind of slide all over
or it'll crease up and yeah so powder
isn't boring so if any of you guys have
seen my highlighting contour routine I'm
sure you saw me mention the prep and
prime and light boost by Mac this is
amazing I always use it for underneath
my eyes and wherever I want to highlight
my face I also have a drugstore
alternative for that which is the Dream
Lumi camouflage and this one is in
radiant excellent air pollutant oh
that's right word maybe that's like
radiant in another language but I don't
know I'll find out for you guys but yeah
they're basically the same thing and
what they're gonna do is just gonna give
you a nice bright surface to apply our
concealer to to give you that nice
beautiful glow as far as the colors this
one is a more yellow tone and this one
is a more of like a salmon tone so the
yellow is more for redness and the
salmon is more for like dark spots so if
you have dark circles under your eyes I
know a lot of people were asking like
how do you get rid of that the salmon
color corrector or the brainer is going
to help cancel out the dark circles so
for those of you asking I would
definitely recommend trying out a salmon
colored brightener and also a salmon
color concealer because I keep dropping
everything but because this is gonna
help brighten up your face and get rid
of any dark spots next we're gonna move
on to some of my favorite lipsticks that
I used all the time in 2013 the first
one I want to mention I just want to say
thank you because I don't remember watch
a video it was but I was always using
creme de nude by Mac and I asked you
guys do you know any really awesome nude
lipstick so a lot of you guys actually
recommended the myths by Mac and in 2013
this was definitely my most used
lipstick I loved love the color it's a
beautiful matte nude color and it really
goes with anything so this one was
definitely one of my favorites so thank
you to you guys for your suggestions
because it's cool just throwing out
different options and trying them out
and then all of a sudden you have a new
favorite so I really appreciate that
another new brand
that I came across this year actually
towards the end of the year was Milani
and I didn't even realize but they sell
them in all the drugstores I believe I
know they have them in CVS and I'm not
sure about Walgreens I haven't seen it
at Walgreens but you can also get them
on Amazon and the two of my favorite
colors that I've tried this year was the
sangria and the nude creme and the
sangria was a awesome purpley deep color
I would compare this to rebel by Mac the
deep color but I know I had posted a few
pictures wearing this and a lot of you
guys were loving it especially for the
fall and winter time and the nude cream
is like a very pretty pale nude pink
color and one of the reasons I really
love the Milani lipsticks is because
they all smell like just like fruity
heaven and when you put it on it just
makes you want to lick your lips off but
obviously don't do that because it's not
gonna taste good but yeah I just love
the smell of these I love how they're
really creamy and they glide on really
nice so I'm really happy I came across
this Milani brand because not only are
they super affordable but they have
basically every color and I don't know
I'm just loving them this year another
friend that I recently came across was
motives cosmetics and if you guys are
big on Instagram and you guys love to
just search around for different makeup
looks you probably have heard about them
one of my favorite lipsticks by them is
actually the one I'm wearing right now
and it's called nice and this is like a
topi purpley beige nude color I don't
really know how to describe it but it's
super pretty and I really really love it
and I actually have a nail polish this
color so should have painted my nails
the color but yeah I love love love I
love this color if you guys look on
Instagram or if you look on like
Pinterest they always have different
pictures of like the lips showing what
it looks like on so if you guys are
unsure maybe just type in the name of a
lipstick you're looking for and then you
can find a picture so you can see
exactly maybe what it would look like on
so I know this is a favorites video but
I really quickly just wanted to let you
guys know about a couple of sips i came
across that i didn't like because i kind
of when I'm gonna lipstick frenzy this
year and I was trying out a bunch of
different brands to see which ones I
liked and I came across these L'Oreal
ones I actually bought them in three
colors before I tried it out and I don't
like that I'm so sad about it but I just
want to let you guys know
cuz I don't know I don't want you all to
waste your money but these ones are the
L'Oreal color rich lipsticks and they're
more like chapstick if you put them on
like the colors look really pretty and
really nice but then you put them on and
it's like basically a clear gloss which
is not really what you're looking for or
what I was looking for when it comes to
lipsticks I like lipsticks that have
like a nice bold color to it so that way
you don't even need lip gloss or
anything else over it but these I was
actually a little disappointed with
because the colors are very very light
so moving on to nails
I spent I'm gonna say about half of the
year of 2013 wearing acrylic nails which
were those long claw nails and nothing
against them I think they're really
awesome but just for me I noticed that
my hand like just all around my fingers
we're not looking nice my cuticles were
all like frayed looking and I just
wasn't feeling them anymore I wanted to
just grow out my healthy nails so I took
them off I'm gonna say thing is over the
summer and I went to Walgreens because I
was looking for some sort of topcoat
that I could put on to make my nails
grow faster to make them stronger and
just feel healthy again because once you
have that whole thing done and then you
take them off your nails are really thin
and just rigid looking so I tried out
the nail growth miracle growth treatment
by Sally Hansen and this one is an
actual clear coat so you can apply it
straight to your nails and then apply
your color over it or you can just apply
it as a topcoat either way I like to put
it on just as the base because I feel
like it's really soaking up into my
nails but I've been using this and then
I've also used the nail growth serum
which it's kind of like cuticle oil but
it's more of like a gel consistency and
I always put this all around my cuticles
and all over my nails and not only does
it help make your nails grow but it
helps with your cuticles and it helps
just moisturize your hands and I don't
know I just tend to get really really
dry cuticles I don't know why I've asked
everybody what my problem was
but yeah I've really noticed that these
two have helped me a lot and my nails
have grown and they're so thick now and
they're hard and yeah I'm just really
happy with my natural nails so yeah I
think Sally Hansen's miracle nail growth
for some of my growth I'm sure drinking
a lot of water and being healthy of
course has a lot to do with it but I
really like
these products and I thought they were
worked really well for me so you know I
had to bring in this bad boy again not
only does it match my outfit but I've
seen so many comments of people saying
that they tried it and that they really
do like it and that they make they have
more self-confidence because of its
which is so cool because I don't know I
was using it for I guess the whole year
maybe a little bit longer and I think I
noticed a difference but I mean I had
also lost some weight so I didn't really
know what it was doing but I still
always wear this whenever I'm about to
apply my makeup or do my hair what I do
is I'll put it on my nose and then I'll
do my hair and then it'll just kind of
be on for about like 10 minutes and then
it's cool because it really does flatten
out your nose and it's code like a
little nose huggy they're like I don't
know like 25 cents maybe a little bit
more but I got him right on Amazon and I
personally love them and if you guys
watch I think it was my October
favorites I actually called my mom and
she knew exactly what I was talking
about when I said what did you always
catch me wearing and make fun of me with
so these are awesome they're such a
great investment I mean they're only
what they're less than the dollar so I
mean try it out if you have a little bit
of a wider nose and you maybe want to
just deflate it a little bit that's what
I like to say just try it out you never
know so when it comes to contouring my
face I would always go and grab my
powder from my brow bar to go and I
would use the darkest brown color to
nominal into my eyebrows but the contour
and everything like that and I believe I
use them in both of my contour videos
and it's always given me a flawless
contoured look but actually recently
when I was in Vancouver for IMATS I
picked up this Ben Nye media Pro palette
just like a contour palette I guess and
they have some blushes but they're all
cream colors and I use this in one of my
more recent videos where I showed how to
contour or how I did my foundation
routine and this is actually really cool
I never really liked to contour with
cream colors but using this it's
actually really cool so I go back and
forth now between the brow bar and then
this palette but it's fun to try new
things because I was so set on just the
powder contour but then trying out the
creamy contour it's really cool and it's
not so different but it gives you a
really really nice contoured look so
these two are definitely my favorites I
know in my last favorites video I showed
you guys the
golde Sigma brushes that I had gotten in
the set and a lot of you were like well
if it's your favorite how the heck do
you know it's your favorite because
they're not being used well this past
year I actually started using Sigma
brushes and then it also thanks to you
guys and I have a silver set already and
I have a couple pink brushes so when I
had showed you guys the gold set I was
just showing you the same brushes that
I've already used but they just have the
gold plated look to them so that's why
they weren't open yet but I also as a
Christmas gift got the Sigma brushes in
the copper color and uh I just died when
I got them they're so pretty and I'm
saving the gold ones they're still in
the case but the copper ones I've been
using lately and on all my tutorials and
just everyday when I've been doing my
makeup and they're so awesome
these are them and this little cup thing
I got a Bed Bath and Beyond but I love
these brushes they're so great and a lot
of people are asking if you can compare
them to Mac and I have been using Mac
for five six seven years and I really
don't see any difference so I'm loving
these right now and I just love the
copper color it's so different and
they're just really great every single
brush I've basically used except for
this big bad boy I never really use the
big brushes but these are so great and
I'm really highly highly recommend them
I think the most used palettes this year
have been a couple so I just want to go
through them really quick the galaxy
Sheik from BH which has all these
beautiful colors I've used this a lot
this year and I love them because
they're the mineral pressed powder so
they're really pigmented and they're
really nice and I just love the finish
of those the other palette that I'm
loving this one I actually got at
beautycon in LA from the bare minerals
so I've been looking online I haven't
seen this palette actually out for sale
yet so I'm not sure if it's like a I'm
at slash beautycon thing but this is
what it looks like and the bare mineral
shadows I actually never tried them
before so I got this whole kit and I
really love these they're really pretty
and my favorite ones are on the side the
shimmery golds and everything love love
love them I'll just keep looking and if
I see this posted anywhere I will
definitely link it for you guys but I
know they also saw the little quad pal
as well so if any of you wanted to try
out some of the colors and the third
palette that I've used in almost every
single video was the blush palette and
actually just ordered a new one because
this one fell and some of them broke but
I love this blush palette my two
favorites are the light pink and then
this peachy color or no this peachy
color I guess I kind of mixed it too but
it's awesome because when you travel a
lot it's annoying to have to pack a lot
of little single makeup things so I like
the palettes because they have a couple
different options for you so you don't
have to go out and again pack a million
different things this is definitely my
go-to blush palette of 2013 and maybe
2014 although I must say this year my
goal and what I've been trying to do is
I've been trying out a lot of different
new makeup brands I know a lot of you
guys have been like well you always show
all the same makeup brands and that's
only because I've been using them for so
long and when you get comfortable with
them it's just if I'm doing my makeup
kind of in a hurry the first thing I'll
go to grab are just products that I know
I've used and I've loved so I know I've
used a lot of the BH and a lot of other
different products that you've seen
constantly in my videos but I promise
this year I am broadening my horizons
sorry I just heard a beep trying it all
different brands so hence the Milani and
the motives and there's actually this
new company called anesthesia and they
have the brow kits which I actually did
my brows with today and those are really
cool as well so again all these new
brands I've been testing out and I'm
gonna continue to test out so that way
next month I can give you a favorites
video showing a bunch of new products I
do apologize if you guys are getting
bored with all the same products but
when I find something I love I just use
it until it's all up so that is
definitely my goal for this year that I
will start looking for a lot of new
products trying out a lot of new
products and then giving you guys the
best opinions of all of them so the
final product I wanted to talk about
today are the Lily hair extensions by
Bellamy and they are the 260 gram 20
inch hair extensions I only have three
tracks in right now and there's one
track on my floor that I don't want to
get up and get because there's wires
everywhere but I have these two tracks
as well that came with it I know in my
most recent get ready with me video I
had mentioned it was my first week
trying them out
I wasn't too sure about how I liked them
I mean of course I loved them there was
no question about that but I was using
the 22 inch 220 gram for I'm gonna say
two years now and those were my go-to
favorites those were the only ones I
ever wore so for me to try a different
kind I needed a couple of weeks to
really try it out to wash them to play
with the hair and everything like that
and now I can officially say since I've
gotten them these are the only ones that
I have been wearing I know a lot of
people noticed that in my video that
they were more bouncy looking and of
course that's because they're new and
beautiful so I personally recommend
either the 220 gram or the 260 gram
depending on how much hair you really
need like I said I don't need to wear
all of the lily tracks to get the
thickness that I like so I just really
thought it was kind of a little bit
unrealistic maybe for the day-to-day
girl who just wants a little bit of
extra volume in your hair
I mean Lilly ghalichi 's hair of course
is absolutely gorgeous it's huge and
amazing but she's always in these
extravagant outfits and doing photo
shoots and everything like that so I
think maybe if you're in that sort of
limelight or if maybe you have a wedding
or if you need the extra hair I would
definitely go for the Lilly hair but I
mean you're paying all that extra money
and if you're not gonna be wearing all
the tracks I mean does it make sense to
buy them it's completely up to you of
course some of you girls have been into
the extensions for a while like me so
some of you want the most thickest
massive hair you can get if that's the
case get the Lilly hair it's absolutely
beautiful quality so I think if you're
maybe just trying them out for the first
time or if you just want a little bit of
extra body and some length the 22 inch
amazing and I still highly recommend
those as well so those are all my
favorites for 2013 of course I could sit
here for hours and go through a bunch of
my favourite products but I just wanted
to go through some of the favorites that
just popped into my head and Selene if
any of you guys want to see some more of
my favorites from this past year I do
have a playlist on my actual channel
page that has all of my favorites listed
there so you can go check that out I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
until next time I will see you guys
later
it
