we sitting in chai hey guys so it's
Friday I'm getting ready to go head out
to get some stuff for my sister's
bachelorette party I figured I would add
this into my Bahamas vlog because I
didn't have that much footage and yeah I
figured it's gonna be a fun weekend so
I'll take you guys along with me I'm
going to the store called Spencer's to
get some like gag gifts for the bachelor
party and I might get some balloons and
some snacks and then I'm heading into
the city so I'm super excited getting
ready to leave now so first stop
Starbucks oh I just pull up I'm gonna go
running really quick
of the day because I'm addicted where
dude it's me they get a nice drink
fifteen degrees even yesterday I
ventured off into the blizzard
I came to get a Starbucks because I
wanted to get it before I got like too
too bad out and it was a blizzards and I
got a nice drink I don't know why I
really can't do hot drinks so on my New
Year's Post of the pictures I used
Taylor Swift's new song called New
Year's Day and everybody thought it was
me but um I got a guitar for Christmas
mass shooting myself because I've been
wanting to learn so bad because one day
I'm gonna be a country singer I had a
nice relaxing holiday spent with my
family and then on New Year's I had some
friends over which was a lot of fun as
well I want to know what you guys want
to see this year in my channel anything
new in particular were certain videos
that you guys love the most like let me
know because I always love hearing your
suggestions we have other than that we
had a crazy Blizzard here yesterday so
the roads are not as bad as they were
yesterday I'm here my mom had like I
don't
it was like our biggest snowstorm of the
year but it's so cold here like insanely
cold on New Year's it was like six
degrees or something crazy so I don't
think I could ever get to that
so I'm just pulling up to the mall just
trying to find a spot I just left
I'm gonna go to the party store and get
some balloons and decorate the house a
little bit
got lots of penises I'm bringing with me
well baby wanna be my 100 stops my car
is completely packed with balloons and
goodies and
I'm about 15 minutes from New York so
I'm praying that there's a spy like in
front that I can park in to run
everything in because I'm alone
who's my cute little bride is it you let
me see your headband hey what do we have
the Bachelorette
start getting ready yeah
cute shown the bag I'm currently wiping
the excess oil off of my skin from
sleeping so I'm going for my dress
fitting for my sister's wedding and I
have involved in a while so I figured I
would take you guys along with me you
want to put something on because the
last two times I went for my fitting I
had no makeup on and I just I like to
kind of see how it's gonna look you know
I mean a little makeup on the dress
always looks a little bit better so my
sister's getting married on February 3rd
it's coming up so quickly the last time
I vlog we were going for her
Bachelorette weekend and of course I
didn't end up filming really anything
because it was just kind of craziness
and our weekend was cut short because we
got terrible news that my best friend
mushi was actually with us for the
weekend that her sister was in the
hospital and then the next day passed
away so it was just crazy couple of days
I'm mixing number four number five from
Fiona Stiles my sister's getting her
hair trial this morning hoping she likes
it I think I'm gonna get my hair done
for the wedding which is craziness
because I never ever get my hair done
but the day of I have to do my makeup my
mom's makeup and then my sister's makeup
of course so it might be like a little
bit less stressful if I don't have to do
my own hair so I'm gonna go for a trial
and say but knowing me I'll probably end
up doing it myself
I want this guy out yesterday in a while
still works just as good mmm use the
naked concealer it's a little bit more
lightweight than the shape teeth for
like a day time it's like the same color
as my skin which is funny
it used to be concealer when I had a say
on whenever I'm in a rush I just like to
use like the bronzer just to give a
little bit of definition into my eyes
and then also under my eyes we do a
little bit of eyeliner
I saw a couple people asking about
putting mascara on eyelash extensions
I'm not a pro I don't know all the
details but I know where I go they sell
a mascara that's like specifically need
but the reason I use the buxom one it's
a water-based so it doesn't have oil in
it and I have not had any issues so far
just gotta be careful like don't pick
them don't pull it them or anything like
that because that took me like 15
minutes I'm gonna get my hair done and
then I have to leave here in about 3035
minutes just finished my hair barely and
I'm gonna find an outfit in this madness
I know I'd never showed you guys my
closet it's kind of a mess no idea what
I'm gonna wear this is always the
hardest part of my day I'm probably
gonna just wear like sweats and like a
t-shirt I'm gonna put you down because
otherwise I'm never gonna find something
to wear they're gonna wear these you
could see how much Tanner my face is
then my body I'm gonna probably wear
like a turtleneck or something like my
winter secret so don't mind the behind
me because mas I still never even
finished it so I haven't done a closet
or anything but I'm gonna just wear this
with like a sweat shirt around my waist
or something of the sort super comfy
I have luggage from three trips that I
haven't unpacked
that's how behind I am with life I'm
gonna wear these Sony's like a really
plain outfit funky my hair is a freaking
mess but my life is a mess my room is a
mess everything is just a mess so she
should I may just love all my Christmas
decorations up I have to go take them
down soon
I can't match my floor my children what
are we doing sleepy BP's hi good morning
to ya what
oh you scared me
Oh what are you doing
I'm filming and I'm about to leave
filming and I'm about to leave yeah bro
at one time well you're showing them
yeah I'm showing them when I feed my
cats it's this applause chicken I know I
got scared yeah and then I always
sprinkle this on top
it's like freeze-dried chicken and I
swear they won't eat their breakfast or
dinner without it so I just find what do
you need the water you can go so just
sprinkle it so between the four of them
I've used to think the food cuz they
don't eat that much so I use two things
twice a day this is what it looks like
um I have to get my dress fitted there
you go but we try okay
is a little chilly out 30 degrees today
yesterday it was like 16
but it's been like 5 degrees and then
yesterday was warm
gotta love global warming or as Donald
Trump would say we could use a little
global warming here in New Jersey in New
York it's 11:11 make a wish so I feel
like I gained like 5 pounds this week
I've been non-stop eating I don't know
what all I know it's wrong it's been
like stressful sad week so
I don't know what I just can't stop
eating like it's too much so now I have
my dress fitting and probably I hope
it's up it's me I know it's a little
stretchy so
so my dress is Giovanni and they were so
sweet and so nice to gift it to me for
the wedding which is
I would have paid for it obviously would
have so nice that they offered to gift
it for me we got all of our dresses
bridesmaids mine my sister's at and my
mom's all at a place called Castle
Couture and
Manalapan New Jersey so if you guys are
in Jersey it's definitely the best place
it's so much stuff every time I go there
I see a dress that I want but I have
nowhere to wear it
we are they're amazing so
market I highly highly recommend them
