finished the filming my video that I was
supposed to do yesterday but I woke up
with a huge welt on my forehead so yeah
that was fun
I'm gonna go edit this and get this up I
had so much fun creating it and I really
loved how my makeup turned out which is
awesome I just was a little worried with
that much powder and that many layers
that I wouldn't like it but I really
really do actually loved how it came out
so shout out to Patrick
so yeah the rest of the day I'm gonna be
editing getting this up and that's
really my plan so I will see you guys
soon every day every go ahead come come
ahead get comfy
as usual this where he does this every
day I can't stand it I swear I can't
stand it yeah I got my nails done this
morning bright orange and I just got off
a video call but I'm so excited because
tomorrow I am doing Drew Barrymore's
makeup I'm literally freaking out I'm
trying not to think about it because
when I think about things i heiped
myself out and I freaked out and I have
anxiety like I have the worst anxiety
ever when it comes to basically leaving
my house so that's tomorrow I'm super
excited I can't wait to meet her she was
one of my favorite actresses growing up
like every movie that she made I saw and
I was obsessed with gonna be using
products from her makeup line which is
flower beauty I want her to love it and
I want it to go well so this is my first
ever collab with someone that's not like
family or friends so I'm nervous but I'm
stepping outside of my comfort zone
because when you do things out of your
comfort zone that is when you grow as a
person and I know that but it's hard to
take your own advice sometimes and for
me I've known this
and I've had a lot of fears that have
held me back through the years and a lot
of amazing opportunities that I missed
out on because I was scared
and
this year I'm all about growing and
pushing myself to all the boundaries
possible because I can't live in fear
anymore and I know once it's over just
like anything else once it's over I'm
gonna be so happy that I did it and how
could I turn down the opportunity to
meet drew Barrymore she is amazing and I
mean I don't know her personally but
just from her movies I feel like your
true self shows through some of your
characters and your movies and I just
think we're gonna have so much fun and I
think it's gonna be an amazing time so
yeah I can't wait so that's tomorrow and
then I come home and then on Wednesday I
go in she's having a meet up at Ulta so
I'm showing up at the end of her meet up
to do some photos and stuff with her and
then we have a dinner and I wasn't sure
if I was able to talk about it so that's
why I didn't mention it before today but
I talked to my manager and he said yeah
like talk about it why not
so letting you guys know so I'm gonna
vlog a little bit of it obviously but I
will be filming it and getting it up as
soon as possible so I can't wait I got a
big box of all of her products so I've
been playing with them all weekend and I
really love a lot of them so I'm super
excited that AI was introduced to these
products and B I'll get to use them on
drew so the thing that I'm a little bit
nervous about is I know she's such a
natural beauty and she doesn't wear a
lot of makeup and I'm the type of person
where I love a natural look of course
but I also love like a heavy full
coverage look so although I'm supposed
to prepare it all beforehand I'm gonna
bring a lot of the products and I'm
gonna kind of talk to her and feel her
out because sometimes people that are
natural at the time want to try
something out of their comfort zone want
to try something different so I'm torn
between what I'm gonna do on her but I
want her to love it obviously so I just
can't believe I'm actually gonna be
collabing with someone for the first
time and that it's drew Barrymore of all
people like this is
super super exciting for me I hope she
likes me nervous but I think it's gonna
go really well so I started to fill you
guys in
but we sit is you try sitting like that
and you want to be like hair it's so
cute
good morning shy walk out of my room
it's idiom when I find my children could
you pretty girl sassy and 8 a.m.
are you hungry girl oh you guys I'm
freaking out I don't know what's wrong
with me I don't know why I'm like always
so stressed about everything but I'm
really really excited to meet her and I
know it's gonna go really well and I
know she's gonna love her makeup I just
never really do things that are outside
of my comfort zone like I've mentioned
before so I have so much stuff that I'm
bringing with me and I got some goodies
for the cause she has two daughters so I
put together two little goodie bags for
them I figured it'd be nice to get them
some gifts I don't know if they're gonna
be there or not
so yeah I'm getting ready to leave in
like ten minutes and waiting for the car
service to get me wish me luck
but how perfect look how cute I love it

carpet or an event or anything but I
