for Nashville it's one of my really good
friends bachelorette party weekend so it
should be a lot of fun I'm going a
Saturday and I'm coming back on Monday
although they're all staying till

just because I have so much to do and
I'm closing on my house next week so I
have a very busy weekend and week ahead
so I figured I would start blogging so I
just ordered some food I'm gonna start
editing now and yeah I'm probably gonna
go get a Starbucks in a little bit
because I was up really early and I'm
running on like no energy editing just a
cute little thing next to me here we
have Bali mr. barrels
mr. barrows that's been sleeping all day
what's up what's up bud oh good morning

really really busy morning I just
finished up packing I have to leave in
about 20 minutes so luckily I got
everything John that I needed to get
done I just have to stop at CVS really
quick and grab on like mini shampoo
conditioner and a toothbrush and the
Starbucks and then I'm heading off to
the airport
so it's an hour earlier there so my
flights at 4:00 but I land at 5:30 it's
like a two and a half hour flight so I'm
gonna finish up editing up my video for
Sunday that way I'm all set so I figured
I would bring my vlog camera I don't
know how much I'm actually gonna be
vlogging while I'm there I'm gonna try
my best but I actually don't really know
any of the girls that are going I'm in a
few of them one time so I don't want to
like shove a camera in their face and be
awkward I'm super excited it's gonna be
such a fun little girls weekend so I'm
just gonna finish up a few more things
and then hit the road so I will see you
guys soon
Queen on her throne do you pretty good
thank you don't there she's mad at me
she's been watching me pack one morning
my baby so I'm officially on my way to
the airport so I've been obsessed with
this new Starbucks drink and in the
mornings I always have my child's like a
necessity but if I feel like I need
another drink throughout the day instead
of getting another try
I've been
green tea latte with soy milk
just put up to the airport 243 right on
time I'm already checked in
I have never fit all of my stuff for
even two days even sometimes overnight
in New York City in this little carry-on
bag so I have one carry-on bag I have my
purse both of them are completely
stuffed up but I'm packing light so I'm
excited

pedal pub I believe which was Sunday
afternoon we had such a good time I
camera end up dying so I did bring it on
out to us after but we went to a place
called the honky Tonk which I've been to
Nashville a couple times and I always
find myself there it's such a fun bar
and I love all the live music and
everything but we had such a good time I
had to leave yesterday at 1:45 because I
knew I had to work today because
tomorrow I am leaving to go to Montreal
so I wanted to be responsible and make
sure I had my video up for Wednesday so
all the other girls left today but it
was so amazing getting to meet all of
them I didn't really know anyone going
into it but I left with a bunch of new
really good friends and yes I'm happy
that I went and I actually have to go
get dressed now because me and Mo are
going to a concert in New York City
Maddie and Tay so I love their music
they are so cute and I actually met them
at the CMAs the first time that I went
like four or five years ago and then
last year I saw them again and we have
been talking on Instagram and they told
me they're gonna be in New York so of
course I have to go see them so I
figured I would bring you guys along
with me tonight and then I have to pack
