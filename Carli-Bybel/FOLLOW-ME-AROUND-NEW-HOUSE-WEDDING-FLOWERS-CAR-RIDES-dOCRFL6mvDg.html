showing awesome mommy feeds her and you
and you hey guys so it's Monday that's
around seven o'clock I literally just
got off the phone with my grandma and
I'm about to take a bath me and my dad
went and got sushi for dinner and every
time that I eat sushi I get freezing
this is what I'm using for like bubbles
I love this stuff and then I just
finished up this balance salts bath
I believe I got this one at Harmons
these you can get at Herman's - or any
drugstore and then I have this the pure
epsom relax and release when I have this
so how cool is this it makes like water
sealing and also please
can I help you fluffing up your own
monkeys laptop I'm trapped alone
you're slowly try-try why are you
sitting like this why are we sitting
some beard human
hey guys so it's around 4 o'clock I am
running up the door now I've been in my
bed editing my video that I filmed
yesterday all day I'm going to meet my
mom for her dress fitting I just had
mine on Saturday so I'm going back down
there it's about an hour for me and then
I haven't seen my grandma in like three
weeks so I'm taking her to dinner
and then I'm gonna come home to finish
up editing this is how my schedule has
been it's been like one thing after
another non-stop and that's why it's so
hard to just get anything done but I
know once the wedding is over a lot of
my time will free up so I'm excited for
it so I didn't do my hair I'm still in
my pajamas I throw on a bra and I
they're on a little bit of makeup just
because I have to go in public right now
I spent the day with my four children by
my side just editing this video so I'm
grabbing my second Starbucks of the day
even though I'm running late I need it
for this long drive that I've been doing
literally every other day it's just too
much I can't wait to be back closer to
my friends and family so I will be
moving probably like June is my
assumption I saw some people asking and
the place that I bought is being built
right now
Sangram the morning goes it is 10:00
a.m. on Saturday I am heading to my
sister's right now and we are going into
New York for her final I don't know what
you would call it walkthrough we're
going to the florists warehouse and
they're going to show us like the
centerpieces and all of the final
so for her wedding we're using a company
called diana gold if you guys haven't
heard of them you should go check them
out they are absolutely insanely
incredible and I'm super excited to see
the final centerpieces and everything
like that I need some coffee enough time
for coffee it's like
eyes aren't even open right now nobody
have sunglasses she asked me she was
wearing stir rooms so we're on our way
ladies hi just grabbed see Starbucks
dum-dum down oh that's gorgeous
so nice
oh this room I want this I want this in
my house I just love this like I want
that in my room well you should feel so
bad it's so not worth it no oh wait what
highlight what highlight are you how do
you feel are you excited mom I think
you're too tan no I think I think you
need to go like one shade lighter
hey guys it's 4:30 I just got a call
from my mom
my grandma was in a head-on collision
someone hit her and she's currently in
the ICU so I'm running over there to the
hospital right now and I'm freaking out
but I did get to talk to her she is a
week but I'm just super worried right
now the last time I talked to you was I
know my grandma was in an accident so
thank God everything is okay I'm running
out the door right now so I'm gonna kill
you guys and once I get in the car
so yeah the last time that I got on
really scary
happen at that point so
I've ran over to the hospital
it was ridiculous because
the doctor came in and me
memorize
he said that she had nine broken ribs
broken sternum part of her neck and she
had to go in for immediate surgery so
this is like what the doctor is telling
us so we're all just crying like
freaking out
my grandma's 82 years old I mean granted
she's like mentally like a 50 year old
she can probably walk a mile quicker
than I can but we were all just freaking
out and then within like two minutes the
doctor comes back and he was like I'm so
sorry
I read you somebody else's
so he read somebody else's results so
luckily it was a better diagnosis that
she had broken one rib she broke her
sternum and she broke something small in
her neck all these bones
all those bones do
so she should only be in the hospital
probably until tomorrow
great news
a week and a half
I was just let there with my grandma
like the other night and I when I got
that call it was just like one of
thank god she's okay
my papa my aunt kind watching over her
they had a sawed off the door and
cracked the windshield to get her out
because she was stuck in the car like
that's how bad of a dachshund
like poor little Grammy you say about is
the state with Grandma
okay today I'm going to see my new house
I think a lot of the framework is up
like the wooden stuff so
it's raining today but I'm gonna try and
go in in
a little bit

it's really kind of me
over to the hospital
that is my plan for today
all right we're crashing yeah see all
your electrical was put in yeah
so then you speaker there in a speaker
there all the recessed lighting is it
okay to go upstairs which is yeah okay

the patio outside yeah

it is a 3 p.m. we went and figured out
my mom's dress situation thank goodness
and we just went back to go see my house
because I was supposed to do an
electrical walkthrough this weekend but
I was in the hospital all weekend with
my grandma so I wasn't able to go so she
was able to meet us so while I was in
the area I ended up going back there and
just finished up with that and now we
are heading over to the hospitals I'm
really excited for my new places to be
built last time I went it wasn't there

sick the past three days I haven't even
left my bed but my dad called out and
said Charlotte and her family were
outside so how to gather my bed to come
see them so I am praying that amaro I'll
be better you guys I think that one
Charlotte right there Charlotte
good morning good morning - - groaning -
3 and good morning - for bow then look
at Cindy
good morning guys I look like a thumb
right now I have been in bed for the
past three or four days it's around noon
on Saturday I'm going to get my
eyelashes done because last night I
ripped all of my lash extensions and
most of my lashes out as well I tried
eyelash extensions the first time a year
ago when I went to the Bahamas with my
mom and I really really loved them but I
think I lasted maybe a month and I
picked them all off I've had this like
horrible habit my entire life where I
would pick my mascara off and when I
would pick my mascara off I wouldn't be
pulling out my eyelashes I would just be
picking the mascara off but when you get
eyelash extensions there's like almost
like a knot or like something at them so
when you pick at it like winds up
pulling off your actual lashes so I have
no lashes right now I don't even know if
she's gonna be able to fix them but the
weddings in a week so I'm definitely
feeling better today still not a hundred
percent I'm still pretty stuffy grandma
update she's doing okay she's home
she's still in a lot of pain I checked
it on her last night I'm gonna call her
in a little bit but she's home and he's
gonna be making it to the wedding thank
God I had a dream that we were at the
wedding like getting ready and I still
did write the speech and nobody would
help me and I was just like flipping out
so I can't get that tweet written so
that's definitely something I have to do
which I'm definitely nervous about
because I hate speaking in front of
people but it's my sister and I'm the
maid of honor so you know I just got to
do it
moving in and out of traffic yeah if I
have any left I don't know how she did
it but she did it I have lashes I
honestly thought that wasn't me like
crazy bald spots but Tony you're an
angel she saved me if you guys are in
Jersey I highly recommend it's called
lash and beauty lounge it's in
Sayreville and I go to brandy and Tony
today Tony needed them I'm done picking
my eyelashes that's my 2018 resolution
gotta get my life together if I can't
stick to this resolution and I pick them
up I'm done with them I really really
love them I'm hoping that I can
handle my life and stop doing it
sinner
so we just wash my face I'm getting
ready it's my friend Kayla's birthday
tonight so since I am feeling better
today I am going to go I did have
another friend's birthday last night
which I missed because I could not leave
my bed so gonna throw myself together
prettier than a little drop and one of
them may be a relative Buffalo p33 4570
when it is too late
play twice
I'm gonna save it okay yeah
so you can remember you think it still
applies I mean I don't think anything I
said was wrong he just found a letter
that I wrote to him when he first left
the house I think before my parents even
got the worst for the ones in me it's
from one I was six years old
Oh what is it the card
