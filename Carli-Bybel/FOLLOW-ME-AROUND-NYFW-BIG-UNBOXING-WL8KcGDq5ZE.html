hey guys with Saturday around 2:00 I'm
getting ready to leave for Fashion Week
I'm going to the Mack Dougal show I
actually met them at the Oscar party
that I went to last year so they called
me and invited me and they sent me a
bunch of dresses to choose from so I'm
going with this really pretty chain
maille silver one and I tried it on and
it literally fits perfectly so I'm super
excited just finishing up my makeup I'm
gonna go restring in my hair of course
it is pouring raining outside so I'm
gonna bring a jacket and use it as an
umbrella I guess but I'm really excited
I can't wait to see the show it's the
only one that I am going through this
year I really didn't plan anything else
but I'm super excited and see you guys
pretty pretty
hey guys so it is Monday around 3
o'clock I just finished up filming my
video for Wednesday I am gonna be doing
a unboxing in a little bit because I
have about a month and a half two months
worth of boxes that I haven't opened
including ones that I've personally
ordered myself so I know you guys liked
it last time so I'm gonna be doing that
I just ordered some sushi I need some
food in my life I'm starving I woke up
super early fell back to sleep got the
video done and I'm running on just
coffee right now and I'm just gonna go
change really quick and then we will be
doing the unboxing very wary I see you
up there so you probably thought I was
kidding when I said I have a bajillion
packages so I'm going to start opening
some of these so a lot of these packages
are from my peel box some are just from
brands that know my address and some of
the stuff is stuff that I ordered so I'm
probably not gonna get through
everything it's probably gonna take
hours and hours but I'm just gonna start
opening them and see what we got
so the first one is from Sigma
it's a little heart box so you have a
little Valentine's Day gift we have some
earrings we have a house of lashes these
are the ICONic I know these aren't
iconic these are Alaura light which
these are pretty these kind of look like
the ikonics
Sigma lip concealer and then we have two
liquid lipsticks from Sigma these must
be new one it's called new mod and the
other one is foxgloves
Thank You Sigma I have this from Too
Faced the best sex you've had in bed
really we're giving you a year of great
sex in celebration of international
better than sex Day February there are
four different mascaras in here um I'm
gonna be honest I haven't never tried
the better than sex mascara do you guys
like it let me know let me see what the
wand looks like I'm like very particular
with my mascaras
hmm really
I don't know what this hat it's like all
dried out so it's completely dried out I
don't know if this was like a yeah this
one is definitely all dried out let's
see what this one looks like okay this
one is a regular mascara this one must
have been empty or something happened
this is what the wand looks like um I
will definitely try it and let you guys
know so thank you two-faced I want to
just say thank you now in advance for
anyone who did send stuff to me I really
really appreciate it of course I have
two boxes from Amazon obviously it's
something that I ordered but I just
don't even remember do you guys ever do
that do you ever order something and
then forget what you ordered I'm always
ordering stuff on Amazon because out
here it is it's the help or cleanup mass
so after I did my last math video I
ordered I think that's what the other
box is gonna be - I ordered some other
masks so we have the carbonated bubble
clay mask so I saw some reviews on this
one as well and I really wanted to try
it because I've never tried a bubble
mask so let me know if you guys want me
to review them and if so which one you
want to see first
so this ASOS box has been sitting in my
foyer for probably like two weeks Oh
cute they have a little adidas hat if
you guys saw I did that post with those
red adidas joggers I picked them up in
this yellow color as well cuz they're
just so cute I love them got them in
green so this is what it looks like see
again so it has like a built-in corset
and it is mesh so I don't know what I
would wear underneath it cuz I need to
wear a bra because my boobs are small
without a bra I have all my cats here as
I'm filming hey Barry
Bowie in a box try she said he would
have all that what bears love bears he's
gonna try and jump up here the next box
is from Jay
medics and we have a sweetheart long
wear lip stopper look how cute the
packaging is so it's this gorgeous red
should i swatch it I swear they have
like the most beautiful lip stuff so
it's pretty sheer but it has a lot of
sparkle to it I cut here on me so I just
opened up the new amrezy highlighter
this is the packaging Gorge open this up
hey girl congratulations Ambra this is
amazing
I feel like you are the glow clean so it
only made sense that you would do a
highlighter so this is what it looks
like - let's see so that's a one swipe
right there I love that it comes with a
mirror in it um that way when you want
to apply it oh that's intense like
do you see this huh
I mean I have a lot of highlighter on
but look at this I love it
congratulations girl
this is amazing I cannot wait to use
this in my next video I didn't even make
a dent in them already sweating so this
is from Quay I always say it wrong it's
either key or clay so I am obsessed with
their sunglasses I wear them all the
time so I can't wait to see what they
sent me these are cute but he's like
pinkish they're like a clear frame cute
I like these a lot actually right in
time for Valentine's Day these are cute
so we have a whole set of lipsticks I
can't wait to try these I love color pop
they're so affordable and they always
really come out with good quality
products so I'm not gonna sit here and
swatch everything because I have way too
much to go
but if you guys want me to do videos on
like Prince and doing one video just
reviewing this entire collection let me
know yay domine cosmetics I think this
is her left eye palette it comes in this
really pretty rose gold packaging has a
mirror which is so nice 10 different
shades they look so beautiful I love
like this deep teal color this is so
nice I'm gonna do a macchiato pretty
let's do espresso because this one looks
amazing oh look at this
and then creme brulee because I am all
about shimmers hopefully you guys can
see congratulations girl
we have a package from ELF I have a
hydrating order sheet mask ooh yay I
really wanted to buy one of these this
is awesome cool okay so this is an elf
beauty shield recharging magnetic mask
it I saw to online but they weren't
cruelty free so I didn't purchase them
and as I had shown you guys before I'm
like on this little mask kick but this
is cool because it's a magnetic one so I
really really want to try this bad boy
out I'm definitely trying this out I'm
so excited
but package from Lily lashes so the
vegan Lily lashes they're synthetic silk
like material and they are 100% cruelty
free vegan and honey percent glam so I
have a nice pink box right here so thank
you so much Lily you're amazing and I
can't wait to try these so you guys I
think on that note I'm gonna end the
unboxing a because I smell and I want to
go shower and B there's just so much
more to do and I feel like there's only
so much of an unboxing you guys can
watch P me are you so beautiful she's
like mom no I don't wanna be on camera
huh what so I was just cleaning up my
shower because I ran out of shampoo so I
just want to show you this is what I've
been using by Drybar it's called on the
raw these smell just so delicious and
then this is my favorite body wash it's
really good for sensitive skin oh and I
always use these little they're called
Turbie twist for my hair that way it's
less laundry and I reuse them all the
time there's just like fuzz stuff to
them so I am taking the cause off I just
bent my nail back again I keep like
bending them back so next time you see
me
hey guys so it's around 1:15 every time
I look somewhere these closets are crazy
I'm going to get my eyelashes done we
have one eye that stayed beautifully and
last night someone went to town so I'm
gonna go get that fixed I first want to
stop if I have time at Michael's because
I got my nails done today they're really
cute for Valentine's Day but I want to
make the hearts on my nails a little bit
bigger so I tried doing it with like I
bought a pen and I tried doing it myself
but um it just didn't come out good so I
want to see if I could get like a
stencil or like stickers or something
that I can use that way I can get a
perfect heart on my nail but I have no
more claws so I'm so excited I'm still
waiting to hear back from mill if she
could spray me if not I'm gonna use my
loving tan so I'll give you guys a quick
little tanning routine a little bit
later I'm ready for the cold with my
crop top and my
large and in charge jacket concrete
boarding nearby nail aboard my move
left and on the street
that was really dramatic i honestly
forgot i was filming so i leave tomorrow
morning for a little trip so that's why
i'm doing my little last-minute errands
today all right boss lady you doing good
yes
right right a don't actually cut I'll
talk to you later
I'm driving fast and I'm vlogging so say
hi to my friends no I think that the
more I Drive too slow I don't want to
hear it he also means as I Drive too
fast but I swear I have an SRT which
everyone's like oh you must drive so
fast I really only do the speed limit
may look like I'm going fast but I
promise you I only ever go 10 max over
the speed limit debating if I should
stop at Michael's right now my nation
says if I go straight to the last place
I will get there to 20
do you think I could be 10 minutes and
my goals
so that was unsuccessful I walked the
entire store I asked for help and they
had nothing so anyone knows where to get
some nail stencils let a girl know so I
just got them done Tony did them for me
today they came out so beautiful I was
there for two hours I'm using the two
hour Express from loving tan and this
little mint I like to do like two pumps
at a time you just want to keep rubbing
it until it's nice and even you don't
want it to be blotchy you want to get
your fingers so here you could see this
side is done and this side is not to
feel like this is a little much right
now so I'm gonna go tan rest on body and
I'll be right back good morning guys
happy Valentine's Day I'm heading out to
the airport now
