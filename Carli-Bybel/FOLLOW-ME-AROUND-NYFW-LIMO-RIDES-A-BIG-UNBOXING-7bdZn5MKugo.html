since I've been up on YouTube ends I've
just had a lot of personal things going
on and I just kind of it all over the
place so I haven't even had a chance to
sit down and film but I figured I would
do a little vlog because I miss you guys
and if you can I would fill you in on a
little bit take you along with me
tonight I'm wearing a t-shirt by the way
we're going into the city for a party
it's actually at Dave and Buster's it's
a fashion week party and it's with paper
magazines so I'm super excited
we had Rihanna's launch on Thursday
which was so much fun but I forgot my
camera obviously didn't get any photos I
was in Florida over the weekends super
super long story
we had to go get my dad he was living
down there and with everything that was
going on we wanted to go get him so it's
been super hectic on my end so I do
apologize but I'm gonna finish up my
makeup I got to just do my nose
highlight and I got to figure out what
color lip and then I gotta figure out
what I'm wearing because I have no idea
hey guys so I just finished getting
ready Moo is downstairs feeding the cats
because I'm taking forever
I thought that I had planned it in and
the fitting so we are gonna head out now
and got a limo again because it's
cheaper to take a limo into the city
then to take an uber somehow so it's
about to get a little crazy in there
what is that
and what do you mean on Facebook yeah
okay on the top left-hand side there
should be like an arrow facing left okay
no there should be like a little arrow
facing like a left way good
so we just attempted to go to the paper
magazine party and it was literally a
huge mob scene outside there was
absolutely no organization and there was
probably a hundred people trying to push
their way and to get in so we went next
door and got something e at Friday's met
some cuties that hooked us up with some
free meals
alena we love you and now we're just
going some random place to get a drink
and then we're probably gonna head home
but this is our lives in a nutshell we
try to go out we never go out and it's
just always a train
maybe over last year
this is karlie feeding wild deer on
their property Charlotte's not really
wild she's kind of calm
she likes Tomatoes
hey pretty mama was so pretty oh are you
because she goes she's so big and strong
hey guys so it's Wednesday around 2
o'clock I just got myself ready I'm
heading into New York for a fashion show
it's the Marchesa fashion show and Kevin
tequan they are doing all the makeup
there so I got invited but they weren't
able to get me two seats together so I'm
going in by myself so I'm a little
nervous because I usually don't go
anywhere alone I'm like always have
somebody with me but I figured how can I
miss up on this opportunity it's
supposed to be a really really great
show so I'm super excited I just got
dressed and my choker just popped off I
sneezed and I guess it was too tight and
it just popped off and broke so look how
perfect it match - it's like roses and
studs oh well I'm gonna have to find a
different one every time I wear a cute
choker they break so someone needs to
find a better way on creating chokers
there's just so much going on which
eventually when I'm ready I will be able
to talk to you guys about it it's a lot
of craziness so I have to put all that
first and I promise you guys I have so
many fun things I'm gonna be revealing
my misguided collection really soon so I
can't wait for that we've had some
issues with the perfume so that's been
pushed off a little bit for those of you
guys asking so I figured I would vlog
today and the show and my experience and
then get this up for you guys I'm going
to try my absolute best to film a
regular video for you guys tomorrow I do
leave for LA on Friday for a work trip
so it's just been super super crazy so I
do apologize I miss you guys so much and
I'm gonna go try and find a different
choker that matches and I'll show you
guys my outfit in a little bit so I
found another choker I think it matches
pretty good I have like a big black
blazer that I'm wearing over this
I really haven't wasn't sure if I was
gonna go so it's kind of last-minute so
I didn't have like a great outfit picked
out but it's okay this year has been
crazy I miss a bunch of shows that I
really wanted to go to
due to some family things so hopefully
for Fashion Week in February I will be a
little bit more prepared so I'm getting
ready to leave I just called my uber it
is pouring raining outside of course so
this should be interesting of course my
hair is straight today so I'm gonna
probably have to put this blazer over my
head when I'm walking in but I'm super
excited I'm a little bit nervous like I
said because I don't usually go places
alone but trying to step outside of my
comfort zone and I'm gonna try make the
most of it so fingers crossed it stops
raining by the time that I get there and
hopefully the uber will be here soon cuz
I don't want to be late these shows only
last like 10-15 minutes and if you're
late they don't let you in so
just got home it took like an hour and a
half no probably like closer to two
hours to get home the show was beautiful
there were so many amazing pieces a lot
of Fringe a lot of like frill
embellishment which are right up my
alley my home Lee Fashion Show is good I
survived I need a change I just took my
shoes off already and I have all those
boxes to open up so I figured I would
film a quick unboxing and then I'm
editing this vlog and getting it up for
you guys alright so I'm gonna go change
because everything hurts and I really
have to be I'm about to unbox all this
stuff I finally made a trip to my peel
box that's why I have so much that I
know if I'll get through it all because
I really really want to edit and there's
a lot so let's get going so as I
mentioned my dad is now home he's
staying with me for a little bit so he
brought up these big tables in the foyer
and he used a box cutter and opened up
all the boxes so they're already open I
just like open them so that was
definitely easier are you kidding is
someone in the box can you give me one
minute of silence smell hurry up
first box la girl mm today have new
brushes they're called pro brush
interesting I'm sure they're really
affordable which is always free there's
so many there's like double layers so
they're black and gold and it looks like
they literally have every type of brush
beauty blenders to be honest my beauty
blender is like my go-to tool so I don't
know I'll have to try them out so we got
some nation brushes this is cool tick
the dual fiber brush I will definitely
try some of these the rest of my eye
ends up giving away but I'm gonna
definitely try them all right everything
is going everywhere put it filming
unboxing these guys thank you la girl I
honestly cannot wait to try them oh this
is also from la girl it's called lip Fi
yes we have some eyeliners I guess these
are okay so these are lip liners which
I'm really excited to try I'm always
looking for new lip liners and then we
have some lipsticks the mirror this is
on the back well looking Gracie I'm
looking like a glazed doughnut uh-huh
the note says Carly you did that
daenerys tutorial sending you love and a
special beauty for you to have okay
XO Kat Von D they love it thank you so
much so sweet
Kat Von D is definitely one of my
favorite cruelty brands ever like I want
to collab with them tweet them
them we have to make this happen some of
this stuff actually came from my house
so some of it might be stuff I ordered I
genuinely have no idea what this is is
this it's this I never ordered this like
a binder empty I never sent to my house
this is supposed to be its I ordered a
sunglass case like a sunglass holder and
they sent me a binder I hate these
things
I know they're packing it so nothing
breaks this is from Velvet 59 my fair
lashes mascara I've heard of this brand
before I definitely have a few products
from them it does say vegan on it which
is really cool so I will definitely try
this out so the next package is
something I actually bought so it's it's
cruelty free and I believe it's vegan as
well oh it is vegan awesome so guys I
kind of want to dye my hair blue not
like bright blue like dark navy blue I
bought like four or five different hair
like brands to try it out what do you
guys think you have to tell me should I
do it I like want to do something
different you kidding I want to do
something different with my hair and I
look so bad with light hair so I was
just thinking of like what I could do
like dark dark purple or dark blue and
I've been wanting to do navy blue for a
while so let me know if I should try it
and if I do try it I will film it so
what do you guys think half the people
that I said we're like do it do it and
then the other half are like why would
you want blue hair so I don't know I
just wanted it for like over a year now
and I figured why not try something
different why I hate them these cats are
eating them from body what you're doing
do take a moment to give me good service
she'll be fluffy I ordered some shoes
from public desire because I actually
purchased one of the pairs I already
brought upstairs but I'll show you guys
another one so these are super come on
so pretty right they're sandals I just
don't have the paper take that out so
these are them I'm obsessed yeah I got
these just cute little boots they're so
suede and I got them in black which are
upstairs because I was thinking of maybe
wearing them today but hidden so I have
to be here I love their site because
it's very affordable the next package
from my p.o box is from me me box very
bubbly purifying bubbly berry claim ass
mmm it smells good this is what it looks
like I I'm so bad with masks I have so
many and I just always forget to use
them but this one looks cool sent me a
little thing of bubbles so cute I'll
save this from Ella cousin another thing
that I ordered came so I'm doing the
Harlequin Harlequin video for Halloween
so I got some props all the Betsi a
little glove and some rings so I got the
wig already and I'm just waiting on the
costume to come so I'm really excited to
film that for one of my Halloween videos
I don't know I was in like a shoe type
of mood I ordered some more shoes off of
a nightclub where I used to get
something there all the time and I was
looking for like a specific type of shoe
and I couldn't find it so I went on and
I bought like a lot of shoes they're
super super affordable though so you can
get like 10 pairs like two in dollars
which is I've always been that way I am
like I don't want to say quantity over
quality because obviously a good quality
item is important for certain things
the fashion I've always loved like
cheaper items my very few amount of
designer items a lot of my clothing it's
from forever 21 and from like misguided
and all like ASOS and a lot of the least
expensive stores so yeah obviously they
have more expensive items on those sites
but I tend to stick to like the lower
end I'm not like big on designer
products sock booties but they have
roses on the roses and embroidery like
this has been everywhere and when I saw
them on the boots I just thought they
were so gorgeous and I can't wait to try
these I bought these on I think it was
Labor Day weekend and there was like a
sixty percent off sale which was amazing
so next up we have legit sock booties so
you guys remember I did a video I think
it's probably like a year ago around a
year ago it was II smell weird loo they
smell really bad but they now make
actual shoes that look like sock booties
cannot survive hair socks and cut a hole
in them and then they still look a
little bit funky but these are super
cute I am obsessed so we got them in
gray same shoes I know some people think
they're gonna get us and they're on
camera but I just love like a cute comfy
looking outfit with look how cute the
red ones are love so I got another pair
of black boots and the reason that I
bought these and the other brand was I
wanted them for an event that I actually
had last week for a Rihanna's event and
they both didn't come in time so I'll
probably end up returning whichever one
is less comfortable and I have to try
them on after this video I don't know if
it's hard to see or not but they they
have like a fringe II type of material
up the front Oh cute so I have a
hydrating bubble mask really cool blush
but it kind of looks like a highlighter
and highlighter bronzer duos I actually
have both of these I think already I
think I bought these is it what they
look like and then we have eye primer
transformer glittering gold a pencil you
guys see how cool its pencil is I don't
even use pencils what I love this I am
so appreciative of every single person
who sends letters and packages and
everything to my PO Box all of the
letters I go through a couple days ago I
went through a bunch of them and I just
sit there and I cry and it's just like
it reira Minds me like why I do what I
do and I just love hearing from you guys
so I just want to say thank you it never
goes unnoticed although I usually don't
ever do unboxings and I don't really
show a lot of products I do open
everything personally and I do see
everything so but I'm gonna show you
guys a picture it's a mattress topper so
I got one for my guest room downstairs
oMG it makes the bed so comfortable so I
actually have a Sleep Number which I
love but I bought myself one of these
Gel they're called lucid three-inch gel
memory foam mattress toppers so I'm
gonna throw this up on my bed and I'm
gonna try it out because it's like
heaven so I basically got through
everything there's a few more but it's
getting late and I'm so hungry and I
really want to start editing so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I
missed you so much
