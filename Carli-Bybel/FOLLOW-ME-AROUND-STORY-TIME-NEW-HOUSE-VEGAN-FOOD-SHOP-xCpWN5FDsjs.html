yeah I'm talking about you look watch is
this breakfast in bed
enjoy typical spot for Miss Cindy she's
the queen she watches over her throne
with one I swear these are like my most
worn shoes they're just so comfy and I
feel like they'd go with everything
two hoods right in a row it's like they
knew I was gonna be in the car
like it's been a little bit since I
chatted with you guys all feeling in
what's been kind of going on the past
couple weeks so I swear I really never
get sick like I usually get sick maybe
once a year and that's been that way for
probably at least five years about a
month ago I got a cold and I went to the
doctor and I got an antibiotic and
within like two days I felt better so
I'm the type of person more like if I
feel better I just stopped the
antibiotic which I know it was like what
you're not supposed to do so I stopped
it and then I was better for a couple
days and then I got sick again so I had
to finish out my antibiotics and then I
was away for the weekend and there was
like a hot tub where I was staying it's
in it like three days in a row a hidden
I got home I had red bumps like all over
my stomach and my chest and I was like
what the hell I was freaking out because
I knew it wasn't eczema because I've had
eczema I know what excellent looks like
I went to the doctor again and I ended
up getting so gross but whatever I'll
sharing this why not it's called hot tub
folliculitis so when they don't put
enough chlorine in the hot tub there's
like bacteria and that's what I ended up
getting so
and a couple of people that were in the
hot tub Dada hopped up folliculitis
didn't even know that was an actual
thing which is beautiful so I was on an
antibiotic for that for a week and then
I was fine and then last Wednesday I
went to see my house I went to have
lunch with my best friend and I had like
a great day and then Thursday morning I
was actually supposed to go to the
meeting that I'm going to right now
Thursday at around 3 a.m. I woke up and
I was freezing like I had the shivers so
I wrapped myself in like two blankets
and then I woke up a couple hours later
like drenched like absolutely drenched
in sweat so I was like great sick again
so I went to the doctor again and I got
some more tests and they they tested me
for the flu and I was like there's no
way I have a flu like and the girl comes
back in and she's like you have the flu
and I was like oh like literally this is
exactly what I was like I was like no
and then she was like yeah I was like am
I gonna die so dramatic but I was just
like not expecting that I would have the
flu because she was basically over so of
course I ended up having influenza A
which the doctor explained some years a
is were some years B is where
this year a just happens to be worth so
yay for me so although I had the flu I
was like up editing working doing all
that but it's fine I really enjoyed
sticking to my schedule I know I've been
like a little bit slacking on the 10 a
and 10 a.m. uploads so I just want to
say at this point I feel like Wednesday
Sunday you will get a video every single
week it's just some days it's gonna be
up a little bit later but if you guys
follow me on social media you know I've
always always update you on editing
uploading and then once my video is
finally uploaded so if you guys just
follow me on there you guys look at the
update as to what the exact time my goal
is to have it up by 10 but with my
schedule sometimes it's just not
physically possible to see me I don't
but I will in a minute okay just man her
over Oh sir relax she did nothing wrong
huh hi hey hey you're calling me hello

maybe they're coming with you
what does he do again he's another he's
a financial analyst I was like I don't
know it heat meets Johnson and Johnson
he basically like he analyzes the
finances description the finance analyst
for John it analyzes finances right
that's it okay honestly that clear that
cleared I really got for me
they barely brushed my hair actually I
did brush my hair yeah I like when you
don't know when you don't understand
something
filming and driving I don't know
nice so if I see a cop I just like sweat
and like I want to like freak out I'm
look here old in this window use any
autos
- Deeb oh my god
so how many years ago probably like six
or seven eight maybe like seven do you
want to tell the story no you can tell
that I think well I like better coming
really the only thing I know is she gets
up she gets pulled over like this girl
gets out of everything she is like the
queen like you she gets pulled over and
I hope you get out of things - yeah but
I get pulled over a ticket every time
knock on what I've been through over a
while you're not good about giving
excuses on the car or I'm not good at
doing what you did oh she gets pulled
over and I think you got out of the car
and he wanted to what if you wanted was
to gonna arrest you it'd just be a
ticket well he told me that I had a
suspended license all right right right
so she was gonna maybe get not arrested
but usually I bring you to the station
real a door now I'm through a rough
patch where I didn't pay tickets and I
actually had probably a glove
compartment full of hardened yes not
alive she was so like crying so upset
and notes dude wanted to get out of the
situation and the sides to projectile
vomit on the cop on demands like without
even having to do anything just go on
the car and she got away with it and he
let her go I think he felt bad yeah he
felt like this girl just threw up on me
like I think he just wanted to get out
of there and go shower too much I can't
she's thinking on the spot what can I do
to get out
well I would be like that I would just
be like all right just freaking take me
down out of the station another funny
story this was actually a part of my
maid of honor speech my sister used to
live in the city and you know whenever I
have questions about anything I always
call her up she calls me one day and I
was with Sam and she was like I found a
little coolest hack like the coolest
thing like you'll never have to pay for
another toll going into the city because
when you go to the city there's like
three or four and then it's like 25
bucks just to get into the city so at
this point we were all like young broke
and going to city basically every single
weekend
and she's all you have to do like what I
do is I hold up my cigarette thing right
where the e-zpass thing is and you just
drive really fast and then they think
that it's an easy task so like you're
good me and Sam were like wow that's so
smart like that makes so much sense so
we did it literally I think for like six
or seven months we went and did it yeah
and then mom calls us up one day and she
has like $20,000 EZ Pass bill books oh
no I'm and that wasn't a nice hack but
thank you for charging up mom's EZ Pass
pillow she never told me about the EZ
Pass bills a cheap yet are you kid
always call and somehow get us out of it
how did you not eat she didn't call you
freaking out I remember it was like some
astronomical number but then we have mom
so she calls up she's like how dare you
these are in my charges by the buckle
and somehow it gets like the twenty
thousand dollar bill down to like
I never saw any of those that's why I
thought they were free yeah it's the
best sorry because not only did you
believe and like me them genuinely
believes it so every Wednesday we'd go
out to her and I was like oh three might
as well just drive in you know oh my god
yeah okay so that was the one time I got
pulled over and I didn't get a ticket we
were driving into the city for a
Halloween party public 2010/2011 look
she was a bumblebee he was like a
vampire and I had like my teeth in so I
couldn't even talk I was like like
antennas and her wings like her wings
were taking up the entire car had like
this tiny little like Nissan if I have
big knee socks on and you're like a sexy
vampire with the bludgers I think he
lets go cuz you were a cute little bead
you know bad didn't want you to sting
him other crazy city stories do we have
that was the night after I've met Sam
like I knew her from high school but we
met like through a mutual friend and we
had a very long night so I don't even
think we slept at all we're very tired
picked my sister and her friend up so I
figured I'd stop at Dunkin Donuts pull
in parallel park go in get our coffee
we're about to leave I put my blinker on
and I turn my wheel I didn't pull out
yet like I think maybe I inch down a
little bit because when you're getting
out of a spot you need to like
especially in the city you got him real
quick
I'm literally inching out my wheels turn
I'm not going anywhere and this woman on
a bike comes and she just hits my car
and we were like oh let's see she hit
the back of my car no she hit like the
side of my car yeah she gets off her
bike and she was like luckily when my
window was up she spits on my car and it
keeps going I was like oh my god did
that really just happen like we all look
at each other they're like a wicked
witch of the web if it weren't my fault
I would admit him be like oh like I
almost hit this woman on the bike but no
it wasn't my fault she just wasn't
looking I wasn't even move out was like
park
keep driving two lights up we got out of
red light and we're parked at the red
light and I like look like just for some
weird reason I like look into my rear
view mirror and I like awesome see her
charging the back of my frickin my truck
and there's tire marks I got a car
because there was frickin tire mark and
she just like laughs and keeps driving
and I'm like this woman it's nice to
remember her big fluffy hair it's like
yeah like I'm gonna get you like oh yeah
come get me with that bicycle woman that
was so bizarre
it's so crazy I think she like pity and
then like backed up and did like another
little like and then like have done I
want to see Aladdin on Broadway pure
genius
are on our way to my new house we ran a
little bit later in that meeting then we
had plans we were there like three and a
half hours but it went really really
well so we are not going to a psychic
and we're not going shopping because we
wanted to get out before rush hour I'm
gonna drop her off at her car and we're
gonna meet mama she might be pleased so
he my sister we're just talking how did
you get brought up

just a little bit not messy or sloppy
just she needs she put her corporate job
and she's working from home she's doing
centage and she's doing so amazing with
them and she's like the most scheduled
person of life so I asked her I'm like
can you just make like a nice little
calendar like a weekly calendar so I can
keep up with my
and I told her I think she needs know
something
so I was like okay but how do I even
find an assistant
that you should do a plug so here's our
plug here's the plug you are living in
New Jersey and you aren't organized to
organize you're a young and ambitious

thin mouldings

closet store that people showed up at my
house and it's not only gets like one or

ringing my doorbell like non-stop I
wasn't home so I got the notification
and I was listening to them and they
were saying that there were a throw
rocks to break my window so they can
break in and look through my house so

kids I don't think that they would
