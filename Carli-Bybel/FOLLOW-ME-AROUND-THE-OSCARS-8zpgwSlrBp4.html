too much work once I get out there but
like most beautiful Jess I've ever tried

bit big around the least the top isn't
even zipper but I know the top will fit
perfectly it just makes my heart skip a
beat I'm so obsessed
back added again mr. fluffy said

on and off the thing he's just working
out showing off huh

gave us little gift cards to the spy I
wonder if this is the spot here
good morning guys so it's around eleven
o'clock we are in LA obviously we are
going to meet some girls from style Hall
for some lunch and then I'm going to go
get a facial and we're going to go get a
massage and probably just relax
I literally only packed my dress to wear
tomorrow and then sweatpants so it could
be a nice relaxing easy trip but I
didn't get to tell you guys yet but
tomorrow we got invited to go to the
Elton John Oscars party which is going
to be so much fun I got to pick out the
most beautiful dress ever
it's definitely the most fanciest
prettiest shows I've ever owned I think
the last time that I got to dress up was
for prom which was way too long ago so
me and Brett are really excited to dress
up and experience the party so it's
going to be a lot of fun but other than
that that's really our plan for coming
out here it's going to be a nice quick
easy trip but I just want to show you
guys in and I'll see you a little bit
heading to the Sun behind the greasiness
I just got an amazing facial I can't
even like open my eyes because it's
still bright out right now I just got
like a collagen facial it's supposed to
like plump up your skin keep you nice
and fresh lifting so I figured for
tomorrow is perfect they don't do any
like pimple popping or anything like
that
so I don't feel right or anything
whatsoever I feel like my skin looks
like super fresh so I'm going to go down
right now Brett's at a meeting I'm going
to go show up like this like that is how
I'm going to go show up and then we're
going to go and we're going to go get
massages we'll probably do like either
like postmates or room service for
dinner tonight and just like take it
easy
and then tomorrow we have to be ready by
like three or four so I'm so excited for
the way the can do normally

I'm thinking like that oh that's cute
okay see there you go right there which
eye when you forget a brush like did not
bring a brush with you and your
boyfriend is still a little comb from
the spa so I'm going to attempt to comb
this raggedy hair with this one this is
just yuck like not going to work and
joining because normally I bring my own
shampoo conditioner and like a little
cave and this kind of like you know what
