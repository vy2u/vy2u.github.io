married and I have a bridal shower I
want a tea party pool so obviously we
had to do the tea party theme so she
doesn't know she just found out that it
was today pretty recently because we
didn't want it to be a surprise because
I knew she wanted me to do her makeup

know the theme or anything like that she
does know who's going so it's gonna be
really nice

threw the crashing meeting room was the
first time Brett saw Amanda he had such
butterfingers met her he thought to
himself how do I get this beautiful tub
to go out with me so he decided to just
act like a nerd would be interested in a
real smarty
when Amanda saw Brett for the first time
she thought he was extra and could
possibly be her sugar daddy don't forget
make a fast break after your reception

wedding night
