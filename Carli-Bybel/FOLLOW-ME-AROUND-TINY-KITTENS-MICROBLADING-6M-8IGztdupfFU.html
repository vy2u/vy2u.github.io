I would start blocking again today it is
a Wednesday around 10 a.m. I just
finished up filming my get ready with me
which you guys would have seen already
at this point so if you didn't and you
like my makeup look I will link that for
you guys right up here so you can go
check that out I am about to go get my
lashes filled in I figured I would take
you guys along with me the next couple
of weeks are gonna be crazy so I figured
why not blog right so I'm on my way now
and I'm actually also getting my
eyebrows micro bladed on Friday before
my final walkthrough which I just forgot
about until now I haven't done it in
a really long time probably since the
last time I filmed it but I really
wanted to try it again because my
eyebrows definitely lightened up a lot
and with summer coming I figured why not
give it another try so that is the plan
so I am in like sweatpants and a tank
top right now and like full glam but
that is basically my life I get ready
and normally I would just be sitting
home editing and I would eventually wash
my face but I actually do have to leave
the house today so at least the one or
two people will get to see this
like and I'm not sure about this
foundation though it's a little like
almost cakey ish but I'll let you guys
know in a couple hours what I think of
it
but it covers nicely and I like how it's
super Mak well I'm not sure about it yet
so I will
be so bye-bye ciao
just got my lashes done good and fresh
I swear I'm a difference
Hey look at me same little nugget let's
go come on miss grandma gosh she walks
just like a grandma ladies oh we got our
gentlemen to go upstairs
other grandma cutie nugget this my
friends is what life is all about that
one kitty to Kitty three kitty poor
kitty she kills me though chai what are
you doing girl
hi Barry
alright I have to edit shoutouts a
Smashburger for having vegan burgers
good morning I am super dolled up for
the morning I actually had to just take
a photo for a company that I'm working
with
hence this at nine o'clock in the
morning I have a lot of errands today
and my cousin's cat actually had kittens
so I'm totally gonna go down there later
and go see them and get to see them - I
was just watching her live video and she
showed them and they're so cute and
they're so squeaky and I'm just obsessed
so I have a bunch of errands like I said
to run first and then I'm gonna head
down that way I'm also going to be doing
a workout class with my sister I've done
it a couple times and I absolutely love
it so that is my plan for today I'm
gonna grab a drink and then I have to
run to the mall I have to do my dad's
phone broke and he has like I'll show
you what he has he has this iPhone in
case you think this one looks big this
is mine and it's completely shattered so
I'm gonna go get him a new iPhone while
he's working and I have to return I have
a couple things that I bought from
Sephora and they showed up broken and
I've won like three months ago so I'm
hoping that they'll still take them back
because there's a Natasha de Nonna and
they're expensive I just honestly
haven't had a minute to go to the mall
since I ordered them so I'm hoping I can
exchange those and then I'm filming a
video for Sunday and I just wanted to
pick up like one or two items that I
didn't have so I tried that new
foundation that I use for my video
yesterday I wanted to try it one more
time because I was a little unsure of it
yesterday and I honestly don't really
like it it looks kind of cakey and not
cute
so I hate when I'm sitting here vlogging
when people are like looking at me so
yeah I'm not really a fan the Beca one
let me know if you guys have tried it in
your thoughts so I just wanted to also
say thank you guys so much I know I
opened up a little bit more in my get
ready with me video and your comments
it's just it's so crazy to see how many
people are going through the same
situation or a similar situation and if
anything I said could have helped you in
any way like that makes me so happy and
just seeing some of you also having a
similar story to me and letting me know
that now like you're married with kids
because you didn't make the right
decision like that also means a lot to
me as well so it's so nice like I don't
know why sometimes I feel hesitant to
like share more personal details because
I mean
I know why because there's so many
people now that are following me so it's
like sometimes I think like no people
don't want to hear about like my
problems my life like stuff like that
but the more that I talk the more that I
realize like that's why I feel like my
channel got successful when it did was
because I was so open with you guys and
you know I shared some of my scenarios
and how I dealt with them and it's a
beautiful thing seeing like comments
back and forth were people that don't
even know each other are giving advice
and it's just like I feel like it's like
a nice forum a positive forum no one
talking everyone just being like
super helpful and loving and that
seriously makes me so happy so if my
channel can be a space like that I think
that to me is like my main goal and all
that I want and I always said that I
feel I've been given this platform to do
more and to help people and sometimes I
get like really hard on myself I feel
super frustrated because I want to be
doing so much more than just makeup but
sometimes I have so many ideas I don't
even know where to begin so that to me
was like a little spark of like you know
what I need to talk more about what I'm
going through and my advice because I've
lived it and when people have gone
through things and can share their
experience people listen to that and
people can relate to that so thank you I
love you guys and I promise to be more
open in my videos just pulled up to
Danny's house took like an hour with
traffic these kitties I am gonna go love
them so much hey oh my god they're so
small oh my god what do I do
she's a baby so these days she's so can
I pet them is she gonna bite in your
place yeah she's gonna smell me wait let
me let her smell me so she's ha look No
cute oh did I wake you
I'm sorry mr. Johnny go ahead so I
didn't end up going to gym because he'll
cuz I leave the went to Petco and
Walmart
I swear this one I want so Carly wants
to take the one with
beautiful girls
so it could
it is 9:30 I'm going to get my eyebrows
micro bladed I sent my alarm for so much
earlier then
when I woke up but I was so tired my dad
wakes me up at like 1:30 because he's
making veggie burgers and he's like you
won a burger and I'm like yeah I do so I
ended up having a veggie burger at about
1:30 in the morning which I hate eating
late not that I would ever normally eat
that late but I still feel full
so I'm a little extra tired this morning
I had gotten them done like two or three
times last year if you guys want to see
like a full video that I'll link my blog
where I showed like every little detail
of it I definitely like it it adds a
little bit more like color and depth
into my eyebrows so when I do get them
done I don't like them too crazy like
dark or powerful because my whole
reasoning for wanting the brows is so
when I have zero makeup on I look
natural and same thing with my lashes
everyone's always like oh that's natural
I'm like no other eyelash extensions so
how freaking cute were those baby
kitties yesterday I never made it to my
workout class oh they're just so shiny
I've never seen something so tiny like I
swear my whole life has changed now that
I have a witness that and got to
experience that I told her I'm like that
is literally my dream of life like I
imagine just waking up one day she
didn't realize her cat was pregnant
because um she had two outdoor cats that
work she was feeding while she was
living in our last place and she had
them inside like here and there but when
she moved obviously she wanted to take
them because she fell in love with them
and they fell in love with her and she
didn't realize that the girl was
pregnant so she just wakes up one day to
little squeaky noises because she gave
birth so like I said that is like my
dream of life like just wake up with
four baby kids just right next to you
like that doesn't have
well I mean it does happen apparently
because it did happen but I swear cats
are just the most precious creatures you
guys need to get one or two actually you
need at least two
I'm here with the brow queen we did it
with no numbing cream last time so yeah
it's funny cuz I never I tell people
about it they like oh man doesn't it
hurt so yeah I might wanna see No
so you do like regular brows her to like
you're a shaping and LinkedIn thing and
all that I actually had someone asked me
if I knew a brow please a dip brow so I
didn't realize you do do it all do that
we do the derma planing
hmmm looks so good already this other
one like so there's my new shiny badges
it's for Walmart Walmart I'm sure people
go in knowing so the people that aren't
really trained in micro bleeding and
come out with brows that look like that
so I just ran home really quickly cuz I
had no makeup on my forehead I am having
another coffee and I'm heading down for
my final walkthrough I'm so excited I
haven't been to the house and probably
like two three weeks now so I'm so
excited to see it all finished
I'm so excited honestly I don't know as
soon as I see it I'm gonna like want to
move in instantly and I haven't even
started packing so for the walkthrough
it's like two hours and we have to walk
around make sure everything's perfect so
that is the plan my brows are looking
fresh it looks so good I love them
let's go tonight your YouTube they hear
Laurel get a baby coming my tiny nugget
ah baby Brooke and baby Collins not me
oh my God my favorite little tiny
nuggets when did you get so big and mean
16 more 16 oh we got Melissa and Surrey
