11:23 I'm heading into New York City for
something really exciting so I figured I
would vlog if you guys follow me on
snapchat you probably have seen that
I've had or I've been having
construction I've been having I've had
construction going on at my house the
entire week and it will be next week as
well so I figured although I've already
posted two vlogs last I'm gonna probably
get this vlog up because it's kind of
hard to film especially because I wanted
to update you guys on so many things and
talk to you guys and with all that
construction going on in the house it's
literally impossible so I'm definitely
gonna film like a makeup video for you
guys or something where I could just do
a voiceover because I know it's been a
while but um let's get in good day so
today I'm going into New York to meet
with Michael Costello his fashion show
is next week on the 8th and he invited
me again this year I went last year and
it was so amazing and he asked me if I
wanted to wear something from his
collection so I mean that was just like
the coolest one whatever I have never
worn anything from Michael Costello and
I've always loved his designs like he's
definitely an inspiration as far as
designing goes he's so amazing at what
he does and I can't wait to see what he
has for me to try on so I'm gonna go in
for a fitting
later on we have dinner down south for
my down south called I own sales down
south in Jersey so it's like an hour and
a half south for my cousin for her
birthday so I'm gonna head out now I'm
running a little bit late
but yeah I wanted to take you guys with
me so let's hit the road
so last night I posted my Jamaica vlog
finally it took a lot longer than
expected to edit when I was like editing
it the first time around I'm like am I
even gonna post this I always like
second-guess myself especially with
vlogs because I tend to forget my camera
a lot of the times either that or I like
don't feel right like shoving a camera
down someone else's face like with it's
just me and Brett like it's fine he's
totally gets it but like we were away
with my best friend and her boyfriend
and they haven't been away so it was
kind of just like a really relaxing time
but luckily I had enough footage and I
think majority of you guys think the
vlogs okay so so yeah but I didn't even
mention in that vlog what had happened
the night before we left for Jamaica if
you guys follow me on snapchat I think I
like filled you in a little bit but it
was the craziest thing ever so I don't
remember what I was doing all day I was
probably just working or doing something
and I tend it and I save everything to
last minute so I was planning on packing
that night but before I started packing
I was like alright let me just get our
passports that way we're good and it's
funny because like a couple of days
prior to us leaving I texted Moo and I
made sure she had our password and I
made sure Pat had his passport because I
think they had to renew theirs for this
trip so I'm looking for our passports I
find Brett's in the normal spot I have a
drawer where I keep all my checkbooks
and like my passport and everything like
that so I opened the draw and Brett's
was in there and I was like oh that's
weird but I had recently just gone to
London with my sister so I knew I had
had my passport I had just maybe not put
it back where I thought it's usually
always in a drawer or it's in our safe
so I went upstairs I looked in the safe
wasn't in the safe ripped apart the
entire kitchen everywhere trying to find
it I called my sister because when I
went to the airport for London I didn't
bring a purse which I always bring a
purse with me so I was like okay I
didn't bring a purse it must be in her
purse she must have just
forgot to give it back to me blow blow
so I call her a million times doesn't
answer finally answers an hour after I
start calling her and she's like no car
like I gave you your password back you
have it it has to be there somewhere
so I freaked out even more start
literally searching high and low and I
cannot find it anywhere so it's probably
like 9:30 10 o'clock at this point I
must start like trying not to get too
hysterical because when you stress a lot
your eczema gets way worse so at this
point I'm crying I'm stressed out it's
two hours into me looking for it
hold on I'm at Starbucks I just gotta go
pick it up ok so yeah so after searching
two hours freaking out hysterical I
didn't even call me at this point
because I didn't want to worry her I was
just praying that my passport had turned
up so um my sister calls me she's like
I'm on my way over me and Brett are
coming we're gonna help you find it
bubble over but I'm like there's no food
it's gone what am I gonna do I start
looking up the passport agencies in New
York and we were leaving on a Saturday
so this is Friday night so if I couldn't
find my passport that would have meant I
would have to go in Monday and then I
wouldn't have gotten my passport till
Monday or Tuesday and then I would have
gotten to Jamaica on Tuesday and we
would have left Thursday so literally
there would've been no point whatsoever
to even go if I couldn't find my
passport so it was honestly so crazy so
I think around 11:30 right before my
sister got there I'm laying on the floor
in one of my guest bedrooms upstairs
because um I had literally give it up in
breath but I was laughing at me because
I was making like the craziest noises
ever but it was just it was
so scary I was like now like I've been
looking forward to this vacation for so
long me and me I've not been away
together in over 10 years like it was
just we were looking forward to it so
much so of course this was happening I
mean why wouldn't it happen as I'm
crying I'm like throwing things around
like kicking things like being like a
little brat and I find my passport
wedged in between I have like an acrylic
organizer that I have all of my jewelry
in and then there's like a box that I
never unpacked up like clothes and in
between like there's like a space this
big between the acrylic box and the
other box it was like wedged in between
don't know how that happened I don't
know how it even got there but yeah so I
found it what as soon as I found it I
started hysterically crying even more
and then as soon as I found it I called
mail and I was hysterical she's like oh
my god what happened why are you crying
I told her everything that happened and
she was like Jesus you should have
called me I would have came it helps you
look for it bla bla bla but luckily I
found it so I didn't start packing to
like midnight that night the night
before we were leaving so that was fun
luckily I had like a couple outfits in
mine already so it wasn't like I was
completely closed on what to bring but
um yeah so he packed me instead of
making it which was awesome so
that was that
you're going
I hate when people like five cars behind
you try to cut you off like you're
behind me
did I miss him I miss the freakin turn
guys I missed the turn because I'm
talking I'm not looking at my navigation
so
hang on a sec let me see where I am so I
also wanted to talk about something that
I've never talked about on my channel
and before I talk about it I'm going to
tell you why I don't talk about it but I
also just kind of want to let you guys
know because I've been seeing a lot of
comments recently I've seen so many
people asking recently she had her lips
done her lips look so much bigger what's
going on like she totally got her lips
on sheets to calm down they look
ridiculous buh buh buh buh ah I've been
seeing that so much lately and I think
it's so ironic because yes I have gotten
my lips done in the past the upper the
upper lip the reason that I did get my
upper lip done I would say the first
time I did it was almost like two years
ago was because I've always had have
bought that big or bottom lip and I
figured it would even it out I went to
like a party where they had like Botox
and lip fillers and stuff like that and
I just went because Nicole was doing
spray tans at that party and we went and
we were having wine and we were just
hanging out and it was honestly fun to
watch these girls getting their lips
done I remember the first girl that sat
down we watched it and I was like I
wouldn't have
for do that I like that look so painful
and then after like three or four hours
of sitting there drinking wine and
everyone just like getting their lips
done they're like why don't you just do
it why don't you just try a little bit
in your upper lip and I'm like alright
why not so I told her to literally do
the smallest amount because I don't I
didn't want my lips to be too too big so
yeah I did I tried it out I had to say
about like three times I've done it so
the last time that I did my lips was
last November and so it's almost a year
so no I have not touched my lips in
almost a year and to be honest I didn't
even want to do them last November I had
taken my mom because my mom wanted to
get our lips done so I was like all
right were my friends having another
party I'll take you I don't want
anything done but I will still take you
so we go my mom gets her lips done or
whatever and the lady was like you want
to get your son and I'm like no before
November it was another year since I had
done it so it was literally like a full
year at that point from November that I
had done it again and I'm like no my
lips like hold on to the stuff like it
doesn't just it doesn't go away like
most people's will go away it was like
well you see how like on your upper lip
there's like a little space right here
that's like uneven why don't you just
have her like fix it right there and
then it'll be even and I'm like
our eight while I mean I'm here might as
well so I had her just to fill it in a
little bit and then of course a little
bit on this side ending ended up and
having to do a little bit on more on
this side and they were just like way
too big and I hated them and I was not
happy so again this was last November so
it's almost been a year I have not
touched them at all and now and now I'm
getting a lot of comments which I didn't
get any comments back then maybe like a
few here and there but now I'm getting
so many comments like oh what did you do
to our lips tail carbon I haven't
touched them in over here so I don't
even know but I didn't really want to
talk about that kind of stuff on my
channel because I see so many people
promoting it because they're getting
like free injections and then they're
just promoting it to their followers and
I just think that's so wrong a because I
know for a fact they make you sign
something that isn't even if you don't
like it you still have to promote it if
they're giving a free service which i
think is second of all i don't
want to promote something that people
are going to go out and be like oh well
if she did it I'm going to eat it
because no that's not the case
I feel like lip fillers have gotten so
popular the past couple of years and
honestly when I first tried it it was
before Kylie Jenner even did her lip so
I feel like it's now become a whole big
craze and I don't want to be a part of
promoting that to the younger generation
because I don't think it's right I never
wanted to talk about it because I don't
ever want my followers to feel that
since I did it they have to go out and
do it so I just wanted to fill you guys
in because I mean
at this point I don't care it's not like
I'm trying to hide it it's obvious if
you go back to my beginning videos like
you can tell like my upper lip is a lot
bigger than it used to be so yeah I just
want to go let you guys know about that
he's the reason I never settled anyway
this is Lady Antebellum flowers
everything's me my dad a song
only one call away I'll be there to save
the day Superman got nothing
guys we're getting ready to leave for
dinner now I decided to wear this bright
lipstick today because I haven't done
anything bright for summer I'm always
doing like nudes and boring shades so I
figured today let me switch it up a
little bit you could see our couch is
plastic all over it and this lovely
plastic here but I'll show you guys in a
minute what it looks like right now so
here's all the flooring they are
starting again tomorrow these are the
new tiles that we picked out they are
all white with like very light gray
veins so they're much more consistent
than the other ones which is good so I'm
really excited to finally get these down
everything is just a complete mess we
have plastic all over couch still have
the plastic up here and in the dining
room so this is our foyer you can see
all the tiles are ripped up they just
put these little carpets here for us for
the weekend again and then this is our
staircase so what they did so far is
they removed the stain from here because
they have to restain it black and
apparently they have to strip it before
they could restain it and then we have
this stair so what we're doing is so
this part here and here and all the way
up we're gonna stay in black and then
the back boards we're going to paint
white I just think it'll look a lot
nicer and then you could see here like
our molding it's like really nice
molding on this side we're having the
same thing done on that side before it
was just like a really thin piece of
molding that went around the whole thing
so we're just gonna have it matched so
they only started the one side so far so
the goal is to have the staircase as
black as the door so fingers crossed and
who do we have here what do we have here
my three are you guys sleepy people's
baseball today it's only remember to
my bed's a mess we still haven't got no
comforter bed set or anything like that
we're receiving our room for the last of
it we're gonna do downstairs first since
that's people are going to see the most
and then we're gonna actually rip up I
don't want to show you because it's so
messy but we're ripping up all this
carpet we're going to do a light gray I
don't know if we gonna do real wood or
if we're going to do porcelain or
whatever it's called that I have in my
beauty room
morning so today for breakfast
I'm having a packet of the Nature's Path
maple nut oatmeal this one is my
favorite at the moment I just add in a
little bit of water hot water and then
you're good to go so if you guys wanted
a little sweeter
sometimes the oatmeal is not that sweet
because it's not one of those like
really sugary ones you can add like a
little bit of this maple syrup that's
what I do and it tastes so good the
award for the worst vlogger goes to me
yesterday in New York City I brought my
camera with me but it was like a really
quick fitting and it was just me trying
on a couple dresses and I didn't know I
always feel so weird like whipping out
my camera being like when I block really
quick so I apologize I'm sure he would
have let me blog but all of his pieces
from the show were in there so I know it
wasn't wouldn't be able to show all that
because the show is
next week but it was so awesome I got to
try on three different outfits two of
the dresses were literally amazing I
think I'm going to go with the shorter
dress so you guys will see that that's
gonna be on the 8th so excited that he
asked me to wear something to show like
that is so cool so again I apologize
that I didn't bring the camera in with
me there and then I also didn't bring
the camera with me dinner last night
because I just forgot I even had it
vlogs are just me sitting in the car and
talking because you know that's just
life so right now I'm heading to go get
a Starbucks obviously I'm going to the
bank and then I'm going to the post
office
and I just found out that I'm going to
Ibiza for 3 days next month next month
it's already September nevermind in like
two weeks with I'm going to take Nicole
because our cats are getting neutered
and that they're getting neutered like
two days before were supposed to go so
to find the reschedule for the second
time and the finds one to watch the cats
was just gonna be too crazy so I'm gonna
freak mail with me so we get another
little mini vacation to Ibiza so that
should be fun
I'm literally going out in public right
now in pajamas this is
normal day for me
I'll show you guys what I'm wearing in a
minute but
shout-out to the cutie muffin that works
at Starbucks you're honestly so cute so
she's just put me that they're getting
almond milk which is awesome because
Martin my car nut
did you guys hear that my car like just
didn't start right so we are off we has
a menu so in a little bit Bret has a
football fantasy football draft um so
I'm probably gonna clean a little bit
organize the closet a little bit and
then I'm gonna get ready head down pick
him up and then we have dinner plans
with some of our friends so we had
construction this morning they got here
at like 80 o'clock this morning and
apparently they were like trying to rush
the job because it was a holiday weekend
so the guy that's in charge of
everything just sent them home was
hiring somebody else to do the force
because that's just ridiculous like we
don't want I'm going to just rush our
floors I'd rather them not come all
weekend and start Tuesday and had it
have it done right I haven't done one
more time so yeah that's really the plan
for today nothing crazy so I have some
avocados here I'm going to make some
guacamole as my snack and then I'm gonna
go get ready because I have to go pick
up bread soon so I like making my own
cuacamole it always stays better and
then it doesn't have all of those random
additives in them so these are organic
avocados are a little mushy so that's
how you know that they're ready when
they're mushy okay so I have my avocados
my onion this little avocado thing that
I got from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and then my
knife so I'm gonna mash those up add in
the onions I'm going to add a little bit
of this pink Himalayan sea salt as well
to it because I like it a little salty
so I have my mashed up avocado I'm going
to just grab the onion and sprinkle them
in I like big pieces of onion in mind
because I just love me some onion and
then a little bit of sea salt I like
putting a little bit in first and then I
mix it and then if I want more I'll just
add more there you have it some yummy
guacamole I'm going to dip some tomatoes
and I also have peppers okay so I'm
about to
take a bleach bath I've never done this
before a dermatologist recommended it to
me um I just had this bleach at home so
I'm gonna try this I just need to put
1/2 a cup into the tub so I'm gonna fill
this bad boy up and hopefully this will
help with my itchiness hey guys so I'm
on my way now to go get Brad had his
fantasy football draft and we're going
to meet some friends for dinner so it's
currently 7:05 so I went in earlier and
I did my bleach baths was the first time
I ever did it it wasn't as bad as I
expected since you only have to use such
a small amount of bleach like I don't
know why when I envisioned a bleach what
beach each bleach bath I was just like
so scared that I'm gonna be like so
strong and overpowering and it really
wasn't that bad because there's so much
bath water that's not looting it so the
reason that I took the map today was
because I was getting really itchy again
which I hadn't been in in a couple
has really been like the first couple of
days
so long so it definitely soothes it a
little bit they say that it helps
prevent any further ones from coming so
it's funny be some funny but like on my
hand it's like basically gone but
because I got so tan in Jamaica and it
was so bad in Jamaica it's like there's
a tan line so it looks like there's
still like stuff there but pretty sure
it's all healed it's just old
but you're distinct later we're going to
I think it's like a sports bar
a little dressed up but you know what I
don't ever go out of the house and it's
Saturday night so I'm like gonna wear
something cute I just got these new
chokers today how cute are they I got
them in the mail I have a coupon code
10% off it really really cute stuff you
gotta go check it out I'll link it below
for you
so lazy we still leave bear playing
sports is me playing sports I love it
the lazy be trying to play just up Mason
I just want to be loved sorry girl
you're caught you're on camera
hey my closets fill in a construction
but I was organizing some shoes and
stuff today so I figured I would show
you so this is the shoe closet I still
have some more shoes to put away over
there but this is like the vibe that I'm
going with all the colors on this side
and then in the lighted ones um I put
some of my favorite shoes as well as
some of my favorite bags I have to get
like a window seat for right here and
then I'm going to get another pillow and
then I also already have the blinds
downstairs brought just have to help me
put them up so we just put those
temporary blinds up there because you
could see right in and I didn't want
anyone seeing obviously right into my
closet and again they're temporary so it
works for now and then this side same
thing just my black stuff and then I
just worked with what I had so I had
bought these from Pier one so I put one
on either side and then this was just
temporary right here I just didn't know
what I wanted to get like a little maybe
big a little mirrored thing or something
cute for the bag to sit on I'm gonna
show you the rest of my closet at a
later date but also today I was
organizing a little bit and I switched
over all the hangers so here are my
pants and all the darks and I put a
couple little hats there also did the
lighter section so over here I have like
my sneakers umm I don't know what I'm
gonna put here I'm gonna do like jeans
maybe some sweaters I just fold over
there but I also kind of organized this
so I'm just having a little snack I have
my pineapple right here and then mango
slices normally I just buy them and cut
them up myself but um I had to run to
the store for a couple things and I just
figured out grab these I also wanted to
show you guys umm these apricot seeds so
I haven't tried them yet I'm gonna try
them right now but I read up on these
and apparently they're really really
really good for you so definitely go
check these out check out the
information that they have about this
item right here because when I read it I
was like oh my gosh I need them so I
like to add in

like to add in just different healthy
things throughout the day just to make
sure my body is getting what it needs hi
Pammy hi baby bear bear poopoo head see
my baby bring my handsome baby look she

cine poopoo you my baby girlie babies
hello it's Monday it's around 4:30
pretty uneventful past two days I think
last time I talked to you guys we were
on our way or I was on my way to go get
Brett for some dinner so we had so much
fun drink a little bit more than planned
so yesterday I was just dead I don't
really like to drink a lot because what
I do I'm just like I can't leave the
couch I'm just so lazy but we had a lot
of fun so that was good right now I'm
heading off to the mall really quick I
have to run to Sephora
and first I'm going to stop in many of
the iced teas
punched
punched and parched
so just left the mall was there way
longer than expected I went into a
couple other stores that weren't really
planned but I met so many cute little
muffins so thank you everyone who came
and said hi Ivan been to the actual mall
and so long normally I'll just buy
things online but it was fun getting out
into the mall and getting to meet some
of you guys I went to Victoria's Secret
the pink store um Sephora and
Bloomingdale's so I got some some
goodies but I got my Sephora here I got
the cover FX mattifying primer with acne
treatment I got the everlasting liquid
lip by Kat Von D it's a limited edition
and I think all of the proceeds 20% of
the retail price will go to project
chimps a nonprofit organization when his
work to stop the use of chimps in
private my biomedical research and
retire them to a sanctuary so as I was
checking out I saw that and I'm like of
course I love Kat Von D I love that
she's vegan and cruelty-free and she's
awesome so I also picked up another
Beauty Blender solid listen guys I went
for one thing and there's just way too
many things um so the NARS concealers
they came in other colors that I had
never seen before so I picked up another
ginger because I was out of it I picked
up another custard because I was also
out of it and then I picked up one more
there was a another sheet I hadn't tried
yet it's called macadamia so it's like
the one in-between custard and ginger I
believe so it's um all just depends on
how tan I am which I've been so tan so
the custard has been a little too light
I picked up the cover FX
total cover cream foundations and G 60 G
50 and 10 60 because I the hardest time
matching my foundations I would have to
mix already told you about this one I
also got the Kat Von D locket powder
foundation and medium 57
I got another booty blender as Patrick
Starr would say I was watching his full
face or full coverage foundation routine
and I was just like I need him to do my
makeup he's just unreal I love him um
what else what else should I know I also
got deep 74 Kat Von D lock-it foundation
oh my god I got another I'm not another
cream of concealer and biscuit which are
biscuit and macadamia the ones that I'd
never seen before and then at the pink
store like I told you they had like
underwear which I'm not going to show
you underwear that's a little
unnecessary but I picked up this really
cute pink sports bra where's the front
of it this is the top and then these
cute little matching workout leggings so
and then seven pairs of underwear for
$27 what a steal and then there's people
staring at me so hold on guys all right
whatever they're not leaving so and then
I Bloomingdale's I picked up a pair of
ray-bans sunglasses
how much were they I think they were
like 1 they were 195 but there was like
a 15% off code for Labor Day so what do
you guys think I thought they're a
little different I don't really have
many round sunglasses so I really only
want to get one thing from Sephora this
is why I don't go to the mall because
when you can actually touch things and
swatch things and see things in person
it's really hard to say anyway so that's
what I got now I'm at the sushi
restaurant I'm gonna go run in I think
it's some Susi so here's the sushi salad
and then we got coconut aminos I know
she told me and then we got the ginger
and carrot vinaigrette it has no soy in
it and it's he's just like a regular
house dressing so that's this this is
currently they put like this mesh down
and then no idea what that is
these stairs have the air the stairs
were stained black and then they did one
thing of like gloss over I think they're
going to do one or two more and then the
painter is going to come and do all that
white soon but we also had this molding
built on this door show you
so it looks nice so it's there and so
that's going to match this one here and
yeah come along I love the black though
you could see what it was before versus
what it is now so you can see before it
was like a grayish brown it didn't match
see how the floors here are cherry so it
really just didn't match so in the black
isn't it better in my opinion and then
of course when that's why it'll look
nice what are my family tune there might
be these tools scratchy tush girl comes
trouble trouble she scratched
I'll be dead save
stupid me
I
