today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this super easy spring makeup look
it's super fresh and very light on the
skin which is awesome for the warmer
days that come with spring I had tweeted
you guys earlier and asked if you wanted
a natural look or a glam look and I feel
like with Jordan view said natural
although there were a lot of requests
for glam so I will do a spring glam look
this week as well for those of you who
wanted that but I feel like it's been so
long since I've done a really natural
look and it's been at least three years
since I've done a look without
contouring my nose crazy right so I
wanted to just show you guys this look
without like the full contour and
everything like that because in reality
I don't contour my nose on a daily basis
you guys usually just see me all lambs
up so I wanted to show you guys a look
without any contour because I would say
eight out of ten times I'm not even
contouring my nose during the day it's
only when I'm going out somewhere nice
or I'm doing my full makeup that I do do
the contour this look probably took me
about 15 minutes total so it's great for
anyone who's in a rush in the morning
and wants to really quickly throw
themselves together I feel like this is
a very natural look it doesn't look
cakey whatsoever but it's also really
like dewy and glowy at the same time in
person I don't know how I'll show up on
camera so if you guys want to learn how
I got this look please keep watching
first I'm priming my face with pores no
more by dr. Brandt before I started this
tutorial I did wash my face and I did
apply a moisturizer that is key when you
are doing your makeup it's gonna help
keep it on all day
for bbcream I'm using this one by Tarte
it's the Amazonian clay I love this one
because it's super lightweight and it
also gives you a really dewy finish if
you want to add a little bit of extra
glow you can apply a liquid illuminator
I'm using this one by Koh Gendo but you
really don't need one with this BB cream
I just wanted to show you guys that
option if you guys don't want to go out
and get this BB cream if you have uneven
skin and you don't want to color correct
or anything like that this BB cream may
be a little bit too light weight so a
fuller coverage that I would recommend
is by Smashbox there BB cream it's
amazing and I absolutely love the
coverage of that one as well for
concealer I'm using this one by
Maybelline it's the dark circle eraser
in the color light I probably could have
used this one shade darker but it's okay
cuz I'm just gonna blend it in and I'll
make it work but I'm applying this much
because I have dark circles if you guys
are younger and you don't have dark
circles feel free to skip this step or
even add a little bit less but for me
and how I feel comfortable I like to
apply this much just to make sure that
my dark circles are covered and they're
covered for the whole day so I'm just
blending this in with a damp Beauty
Blender and I'm also applying the
concealer on my eyes to get rid of the
darkness on my eyes
to set the concealer I'm using by Laura
Mercier the secret brightening powder
it's really important if you are
applying concealer to apply a loose
powder otherwise your concealer is going
to crease and it's going to wipe off
throughout the day so I'm just applying
a little bit on the end of a fluffy
brush and with a very light hand I'm
applying that underneath my eyes you
want to make sure you blend out any
creases underneath your eyes before you
do this and then I'm picking up some
more loose powder on my Beauty Blender
and I'm just going to be applying that
everywhere that I applied my concealer
that way it just sets it and it helps
keep it on all day long
for brows I'm first shaping them with
the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow is in
the color dark brown I love how it has a
comb on one ends you can brush your
brows up and then really shape them it's
such a fine tip so if you do want to
reshape your brows a little bit or fill
them in without them looking too bushy I
definitely recommend using this first to
fill them to fill them to fill in the
back a house that's a fill um that's
then to fill my brows I'm using the
darker shade in the brow bar to go by
gerard cosmetics sorry guys I currently
have Bret behind me while I'm doing my
voiceover and normally I like to do my
voiceovers alone but for bronzer I'm
using this one by color pop it's like a
satin finish at first it's not as
pigmented but once you just swirl it
around a little bit and you get past
like the top layer it's super pigmented
so you only need a little bit I'm
applying this all over my face to bronze
it up since I did use a lighter
concealer I know it may look really
weird at this point but I'm going to
show you a little trick to make it look
a lot more natural so just apply your
bronzer wherever you want to be tan and
then follow along and I'll show you my
next trick
okay so next I'm grabbing a big blush
brush like this there's nothing on it at
all I wiped it off on the towel
beforehand and what I'm gonna do now is
just gonna do circular motions all over
my face and this is just gonna blend the
bronzer into the BB cream and also the
concealer it's also gonna take off any
excess product it's just gonna help melt
it all together and just make it look
completely flawless it's gonna look like
your skin and not like you have bronzer
and all of that on so that's just a
little trick that I've been doing lately
and it helps really bring the whole look
together and it also helps remove any
excess makeup as I had previously said
moving on to eyes I just wanted to keep
it super light and super easy I'm using
the second highlighter shade from my
Carli bybel palette this palette is
limited edition and I'm not sure how
much longer it will be around but we are
keeping the original launch price which
is 1250 for the rest of the month
so if you guys didn't get it yet and you
do want to get it for the 1250 make sure
you are buying it before May 1st because
then the price is going up to 1450 when
we first launched it back in September
we were only going to keep it at 1250
for like the first week or two but since
way more of you wanted it than we had
expected we were sold out for a while so
we did keep that price at 1250 that way
everyone who wanted it the first time
around could get it so again make sure
you do buy it before May 1st if you do
want to add that reserve 1250 price so
I'm just applying this light shade in my
tear duct on my Cupid's bow and anywhere
I really want to highlight
I'm applying the same color in my crease
that I use to bronze up my face I feel
like whenever you're in a rush or when
I'm personally in a rush I like to use
as little products as possible so that's
why I'm using the shade in the crease of
my eye just to add a little bit of
dimension and to make my eyes look a
little bit more awake
for today's look we're not going to use
any false lashes I'm just gonna be
applying my mascara I'm using this one
by Lancome I always like my lashes super
clumpy and thick so if you guys prefer
them more natural then you can use a lot
less mascara than I'm using but I just
prefer them that way
so of course bear was distracting me and
when I'm distracted
but I just cleaned it up with a makeup
wipe so it's no big deal I'm going in
with the same mascara on my bottom
lashes as well
and then for blush I'm using this blush
palette from BH Cosmetics I'm using this
right pink shade and then I'm also
picking up a little bit of this more
rosy pink shade and I'm just applying
that on my cheeks so to get the blush to
show on camera with all these lights I'm
applying a little bit more than maybe
you would need to I'm going to do that
same technique that I had done earlier
after the bronzer after I apply a little
bit of this darker mob shade
from my palette underneath my eyes
so again I just wiped off my brush
making sure there was no powder or any
color on it and then I'm just doing
those circular motions all over my face
to remove any excess product and to
blend the blush into the bronzer into
the concealer and all of that for lip
liner I'm using world by Mac and for
lipstick I'm using this liquid lipstick
by color pop it's called spritz it was a
little too pink in my opinion which I
feel like I always want to use the
bright pink and then it always looks too
pink so I'm just adding a little bit of
pure Hollywood over it to just comment
down a little bit and then to finish off
the look I am using the green tea
setting spray from Gerard cosmetics
so this is the final result it's
supernatural and I feel like I would
definitely be using this routine on
those really hot spring days but I love
switching over to BB creams and lighter
makeup because that means that the lower
mother is coming so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and until next time I will see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
