today's video I'm going to show you my
current drugstore foundation routine I
recently picked up a few new products
and I've been absolutely loving them for
primer today I'm using the blurring
primer by elf and then I'm going in with
a liquid illuminator and just applying
that right on my cheeks I don't really
like to apply powder highlighter at the
end so I've just been doing this lately
and for foundation I'm using the pro
foundation by la girl I'm mixing in two
colors which I will list them below for
you guys and I am just dying that onto
my face I ended up putting way too much
on my forehead I will be wiping a lot of
that off in like one minute with my
Beauty Blender before I started this
video I did apply a little bit of like a
body bronzer that's why my body is
darker than my face then was a damp
Beauty Blender I'm just going to be
blending all that and I'm going to be
scooping off basically all the
foundation webbing it onto my towel to
blend out my neck I'm using a morphe
brush and they're almost to cause the
tragedy but we're all good
so for today I'm using the new wet wild
contour sticks
I actually just picked this up yesterday
and I love this product I wasn't sure
how I was going to feel about it but
it's super creamy and it blends out
really really nicely it also held up so
great throughout the entire day so I
definitely will be using this one again
I think I have all the products that I
did use today this one was definitely
one of my favorite
for concealer I'm using the only one so
far that I really really love that I
know is cruelty free this one is my la
girl it's the pro conceal I've used this
so many times and it's very comparable
to the NARS creamy concealer it's
definitely a full coverage concealer and
it's easy to blend out and all that so
I'm just going to be blending out the
contour with that same brush I used for
my foundation and then to blend out my
under eyes and all the concealer I'm
going to be using my Beauty Blender so I
wanted to show you guys like a full
coverage drugstore foundation routine
with like the full cream contour and
highlight that way if you guys are in
the market for a good product and you
don't want to spend a lot of money you
guys can try out some of these products
so of course the cream contour you guys
do not have to do you can just do a
powder contour if that's what you prefer
but I wanted to do my exact foundation
routine how I would with some higher-end
products that way you guys can see that
it looks just as good with the lower end
products as it does with the higher-end
products
for patter I'm using the airspun powder
and I'm just first letting out the
under-eye creases and I am applying this
with a brush under my eyes on the sides
of my nose also where my smile lines are
and then I'm applying a little bit above
my brows as well I like to apply this
wherever I get super shiny and I'm just
going to let it sit for a little bit
while I do the powder contour or the
bronzer I'm using the NYX contour kit
and I'm just mixing the bronze color and
the more cooler tone to contour and
bronze up my face at the same time
with a smaller tapered brush I'm using
those same two colors and I am just
going over where the cream contour was
to set the cream contour and also to
accentuate being nose contour since I
forgot to put concealer on one eye I
applied it on the other eye and then I'm
just setting that as well with some
mousse powder that way there are no
creases on my eyes then I'm just buffing
the powder into my skin and just
cancelling out any of like the harsh
lines that I had applied with the
contour and then for brows I'm using
this Jordana eye brow pencil this is
actually the first time that I've ever
used it as well and I really really
loved it it came out super dark that I
didn't even need a brow powder which was
really cool and when I was looking for
like a light blue eyeshadow shades today
I really couldn't find anything so since
the foundation routine is going to say
it 100% drugstore I decided I'm going to
use my thi shadow palette it has a bunch
of foil eyeshadows in it and I'm just
mixing the royal blue shade with the
white shimmer shade and it's going to
give you like the perfect baby blue
shadow I went to like a couple of
drugstores I went to Walmart and Harmon
and I couldn't find anything that was
baby blue so I just had to work with
what I had and I actually really really
love how it came out I think it's such a
pretty light blue
so I just found out that my mall has an
elf store it's brand new which is
awesome so I went there the other day
and I picked up some goodies one thing I
did pick up was this eyeshadow palette
and I'm applying this lighter beige
color right into my crease and I'm just
using a large fluffy brush to do this
when all of my lashes fell out I was
like looking for different products that
help make your eyelashes grow so I
actually got this one at Ulta by
Physicians Formula it's an eye liner
with serum in it that's supposed to help
your lashes grow so this is actually the
first time that I am using it I don't
know how well it actually works as far
as growing the lashes but I really love
how my eyeliner came out today to open
up my eyes a bit I'm using this nude
pencil by NYX and it's just going to
again open up my eyes brighten them and
just make them look a lot larger and
then I'm picking up like this mob
purpley shade and I'm applying that with
a pencil brush right on my lower lash
line from mascara I tried out this new
one that I just got it Alta as well it
reminds me a lot of this Lancome one
that I used to use so I actually really
really love this one I'll listed below
for you guys it's definitely my favorite
drugstore mascara at the moment for
blush I'm picking up this NYX blush
palette when I saw it it reminded me so
much of the NARS blush palettes that I
have so I wanted to try it out and it is
definitely super pigmented worth the $20
in my opinion if you guys are looking
for a blush palette for highlighter I'm
using this one by wet and while this one
is amazing I've used it a few times and
it's definitely my favorite drugstore
highlighter at the moment
and for lips today I am going back to my
original favorite if you guys have been
following me for a while you remember
the Jordana tawny lip liners I used to
talk about all the time it really is the
most perfect color I found one that was
unopened so I knew I had to use it today
and then for lipsticks I'm mixing three
of these NYX lipsticks I didn't know
what color I wanted to go for honestly I
applied a tiny bit of the noodle in
which you can definitely skip I feel
like I mix more like the light pink and
the peach one to give me this final look
and then to set my face I'm using this
elf illuminating facial spray and I'm
just using my sleep but my Beauty
Blender and I'm just going to like
bounce that over my face just to make
sure everything's blended in nicely it's
going to make sure there's no sharp
lines or anything like that and that is
how I created this look
so this is the final result I tried out
a bunch of new product in today's video
and I really really loved how it came
out I feel like although I have a lot of
thoughts on my face it does not feel
heavy whatsoever doesn't feel cakey or
anything like that which is amazing so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and until next
time I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
