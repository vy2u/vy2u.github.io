spinning around in
in circles it ain't my style but I don't
care I'd do anything we hi everybody
thank you for watching so today on my
way home I was driving and I always tend
to get creative or get some creative
ideas while driving I don't know
something about windows down a music up
it's just very relaxing to me so anyways
I was deep in thought and I was like
alright so what do I want to film today
I need to film another video this week I
had just gotten my nails done yesterday
and I picked out this fuchsia color and
I was like maybe I should do some sort
of makeup look that involves this color
so I don't know I think some of you guys
are getting just bored of my normal
makeup video so I was like how can i
maybe put a little twist on this to make
it a little bit different a little bit
more fun and I was like well wouldn't it
be cool if I started a new series where
I picked a different color every week or
every two weeks whenever I decide to
post it and I mentioned my top 10 to 15
beauty products that have that color so
not only does it give me an excuse to
dig through all my makeup and find the
colors but also if you guys are ever
wearing a certain color or if you want a
certain color you can take oh let me go
to her color series go through them and
be like Oh fuchsia I'm wearing something
fuchsia I need a couple ideas on what
fuchsia lipstick to get you click it and
then here I am giving my suggestions of
my favorite products with that color so
I gathered up about 10 products and
lipsticks nail polishes I think I got
one blush and eye shadow and a bunch of
different stuff all with this beautiful
fuchsia / magenta / strawberry ish
looking color I wasn't sure exactly what
this color was so I posted a picture on
Twitter and I think the majority of you
said fuchsia so I'm going with fuchsia
and yes so I'm going to go through a
couple of my favorite products and then
I'm going to show you how i got this
makeup look so if you guys want to hear
what they are and learn this look please
keep watching so to go along with the
fuchsia theme of course I had to put on
my custom-made iPhone cover with a
little cute penguin his light pink belly
and then the fuchsia bow which is so
crazy because it's literally me right
now
like this penguin is me so cute okay so
first I'm going to talk about lipsticks
I'm going to talk about some cheaper
alternatives versus some higher-end
products and along with each product I'm
going to show you guys a nice swatch the
first lipstick I have is called
spellbound and this one is by covergirl
this you can pick up right at your
drugstore or of course on Amazon next up
by next we have this one in the color
sweet tart Nick's not NYX I know I've
been saying NYX NYX NYX who knows I
actually just recently started trying
these products so I never even knew but
this is a beautiful color by NYX as well
also by next we have the chunky dunk
oh I honestly hate that word if it's
really bothering me that I just said
that
but it's AHA so hydrating lippy but it's
actually really pigmented so I
definitely wanted to include this in it
as well
another amazing fuchsia lipstick is by
BH it's called pop cultured I think so
far this has been the most pigmented one
so it's really pretty so this next
lipstick is the one that I'm actually
wearing on my lips it is by dirty little
secret we have guilty pleasure and it's
actually a newer brand the girl actually
is from New Jersey the one who started
it so of course when I tried out her
lipstick I had to support my fellow
Jersey girl these lipsticks are great
and like I said this is the one that I'm
wearing right now I used a liner and
then I used a little bit of a lip tar
which I'll show you in a minute over it
and of course the tutorial is coming so
you will see exactly how I did it but
these lipsticks are amazing they're
really really creamy and the reason I
chose this one is because sometimes my
lips get I shouldn't say sometimes
basically all the time when I put
lipstick on my lips gets super dry so
I'm like grabbing a lipstick that's
pretty creamy when it goes on and it's
not that super matte dry look because if
I'm going to do that that I need to use
a clear chapstick underneath these are
only ten dollars and I do have a coupon
code for 10% off which I will be listing
below and as usual every single product
that I mentioned in this video will all
be listed out on my blog along with
direct links and all that good stuff in
case some of you guys didn't know that
next up by dose of colors we have the
color seductive this one is really
beautiful I actually purchased two dose
of colors because I seen them all over
and after I tried them I went out and I
purchased all of them I know a lot of
people got these gifted for them but
unfortunately I wasn't one of them I
actually went out and bought all of them
so these are great they're really really
pigmented and I absolutely love the
finish of it and the last lipstick that
I have is by Mac and flat out fabulous
and I think this one is the closest to
my nail color just rank Oh I don't even
have pants on okay so yes back to my Mac
lipstick I love this one but of course
the Mac ones are a little bit more
pricey and of course as most of you
probably know the MAC lipsticks are
super pigmented
but those are definitely my top
favorites I do have a couple others that
i swatched and i didn't want to include
but it's also cool because now I'm going
through all my stuff for a reason
looking for a specific color trying out
all the products finding my favorites of
those to bring into the video to show
you guys so in a way it's like a win-win
situation I'm helping you out I get to
experiment and play with some of the
products that maybe I wouldn't have used
on a daily basis or that I didn't even
know existed in my collection but um I
have two other lip products and I think
obviously the main products that I'll
continue Ashley showing these color
series are lip products because those
are the biggest maybe depending on the
color that I pick it might be a
different color but I was thinking of
doing like a mint video next because I
have some really cool mint products but
anyway back to the fuchsia I have this
lip tar which I put a tiny little drop
right over everything to give it a shiny
look this one is by obsessive compulsive
cosmetics and it is called pretty boy
the final lip product that I have is
like a liquid lipstick this one is
Bifengxia I don't know if I'm
pronouncing that right cosmetics but
this is really really cool these liquid
lipsticks are just like they said liquid
lipstick so they're glosses but they're
extra pigmented so they come out really
really pretty
so unfortunately when I went to get my
nails done yesterday I used one of the
polishes that they had in the salon I'm
gonna say the brand was Nicole for the
nail polishes but I'll try and find it
but I had a few duplicates at my house
that I wanted to show you guys that are
really awesome as well this one by
Revlon is called plum seduction and then
this one by Essie is called - taboo to
go along with the lips I actually
outline my lips with this this one is by
Mac and it's called more to love and
this was actually the only lip liner
that I had in this color so of course I
had to go and grab this one I'm sure
they have drugstore duplicates but
another reason I wanted to do this video
was not only can I share my favorites
but if you guys have some cheaper
alternatives or some favorites of your
own I would love for you guys to comment
down below that way we can all interact
and share our favorites because I'm
sorry nobody understands my makeup
obsession quite like you guys because
happy you probably are starting to get
obsessed with it as well it's just so
much fun it's like - fuchsia blushes
that I'm going to share with you guys
one it has been my favorite literally
forever the ten color blush palette by
BH if you guys don't own it please get
it it's literally eleven dollars maybe
even ten dollars and it has all these
different shades in it which you could
tell it's broken a little bit and I've
used it a lot but this fuchsia shade is
amazing if you dip your brush just once
or twice very very very lightly it gives
you this little pink look right here and
yeah these colors are so pigmented I
love this blush palette like no other if
I go on vacation or anything this is
always coming with me
and I also picked up the little color
glitter master glaze by Maybelline and
this one is cool it's like one of those
liquid not liquid um what would you call
this consistence brainfart but yeah
these are like blush sticks and I just
like to either take a little bit on my
finger and then dab it on my cheeks and
yeah I think these types of blushes are
definitely better when it's warmer out
say you're doing like a no makeup makeup
look and you just want to add a little
color to your cheek these are great
they're like little stains almost and
they're not like a powdery finish my new
eyes in the 70s palette had a really
pretty fuchsia color which I used in the
crease of my eye you could see this one
right here I actually use this along
with this darker purple to do the
shadows in my eyes and I love love love
this color and as usual you guys know I
use BH all the time and it's not because
I'm sponsored by them it's because which
I'm not by the way I'm not sponsored by
the age but I just love their products
and when I first started out I wanted to
try a lot of new colors and a lot of new
products and I didn't really have the
money to try all the things at Sephora
and all that so the BH I think is an
amazing stepping stone into the right
direction and not only other shadows
pigmented but I always tend to grab
these shadows over my Mac shadows or any
other shadows
now the last two products I'm going to
talk about before we get into this
tutorial are my earrings these are
custom made by ludora boutique which you
all know how obsessed I am with ludora
and yeah they're the perfect fuchsia
color I also have these other ones which
I've worn and I think at least two
videos these are also by ludora and
they're just so beautiful I'm sorry but
ludora boutique earrings are everything
every time I wear them I get stops and
people are like oh my god where'd you
get your earrings but yeah so that is it
for my top fuchsia beauty products
please comment below and let me know if
you guys like this idea I was thinking
to do a bunch of different colors and
then add them to a playlist on my
channel that way whenever you guys are
in need of a look depending on the color
you can just be like oh I remember Carly
did a video on that and you can just go
down click the fuchsia and there you go
so I hope you guys enjoyed it some of my
top favorite products again please
comment below let me know some of your
favorites and if you want to learn how
to get this makeup look please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
going to be using my Sigma a week I
shadow base and then over that I'm
applying my shadow in the color chase
grabbing my 70s palette from BH I'm
mixing this fuchsia color along with
this purple color and I'm going to be
slowly blending it into my crease you're
going to want to pick up a little bit of
product at a time and slowly build I'm
just very lightly blending this into my
crease bringing it towards the inner
part of my eye and then slowly dragging
it out towards the end of my eyebrow
grabbing my Mac gel liner I'm then
lining my upper lash line
For Lashes I'm using by the lure they
are called dummy up and these are
definitely one of my favorites then
grabbing this gold color I'm lining my
lower lash line hang up this a fuchsia
blush I'm just very lightly dipping it
in and applying it right onto my cheeks
then to add a highlight to my face I'm
using this eyeshadow by Kiko
to line my lips I'm using more to love
by Mac for lipstick I chose guilty
pleasure and then right over that I'm
applying literally one little drop of
the lip tar and this is just to make it
a little bit shinier and to really bring
out the fuchsia color grabbing a little
bit more of that chase shadow I'm going
to be highlighting right on my Cupid's
bow so this is the final result I hope
you guys enjoyed this video it's
definitely something new and I don't
think I've seen anybody do anything like
this which I'm not really sure but it's
just something that came to me while I
was driving home and I don't know
sometimes just randomly I'll have these
like great ideas that pop into my head
and I'm like you know what I think that
my viewers may like that so definitely
let me know how you guys like this idea
because if so maybe I can do like one a
week for a couple weeks or maybe one
every two weeks but yeah definitely
leave feedback because I want to hear
what you guys want to see on my channel
I hate getting too repetitive and I hate
being too repetitive and doing the same
things over and over again so love you
guys so much thank you for watching and
until next time I'll see you guys later
upon me away cuz I don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
