see you hurting you're not hiding
anything
and frankly it's gotten me hi everyone
thank you for watching so I know a lot
of you were requesting a hall I had
posted on my Facebook and Twitter and a
lot of you were saying thumbs up and yes
to that so I'm gonna be showing you a
couple of my favorite new beauty
products some new clothing and all kinds
of different stuff that I've gotten
recently so if you want to see what I've
gotten please keep watching so I posted
a picture using my Mac rebel lipstick
and a lot of you were asking about it
and I actually found a drugstore
alternative that's like what I'm wearing
right now that's so close to it and it's
so pretty
it's this purple color by Revlon and
it's called violet frenzy yeah that's
gonna show and I got this one at Walmart
they're actually a lot cheaper at
Walmart than they are at Walgreens where
I usually go so I think it was maybe
like four or five dollars and the color
is awesome again the one I'm wearing
right now big fan of that and another
color that I love for like the fall
wintertime is it's called spellbound by
yep covergirl and it's like this deep
pink purple color and I love it I just
got this one recently so yeah those are
my two favorite lipsticks right now for
fall you can see there's the purple and
then the pink
two other things that I picked up from
Walgreens and I know Walgreens is
definitely my favorite store you guys
probably already guessed that but what
they have now is a Walgreens card so
they have different deals where it's
like buy one get one half off so when I
was in there I saw these two new
Maybelline quads this is one of them
it's called smokey night and then the
other one is called gutsy green and I
love these colors and I love how they
put four colors together so it's
basically showing you what colors do
look better if you get a big palette
sometimes you're kind of confused and
you're a little scared to try different
colors so when you get the quads it's
really cool because again they pick them
for you this I got today I haven't tried
it yet but it was on sale for $4.99 it
is a aromatherapy eye mask with lavender
and chamomile and you could put it in
the microwave for about 30 seconds I
think or you can put it in like a ziploc
bag and put it in the freezer for
cooller effect and I'm super excited to
try this I know I've seen a bunch of
these around I just never got around to
getting them but at Walgreens today was
$4.99 on sale so I mean I had to get it
so I will keep you updated on how that
is so for nail polish if I do them
myself which usually I do I love getting
simple colors because they're only $1.99
and they have such beautiful colors mine
this one at San Francisco I just got
this one I can't wait to try it it's
like a really pretty emerald green and I
think it's gonna be perfect for a winter
time or even fall time I'm not even sure
when falls over but I love this color so
I'm definitely try this out and I know a
lot of you were asking about my nails
that I had posted I picture four so if
you want to see a tutorial on how I did
them it's kind of like the faded glitter
look let me know so I just tried a few
products from a new company called
Michael Todd this is my absolute
favorite this one is the gel eye
treatment and I use this every single
night after I wash my face I have a
pretty recent skincare video so I mean
if you want to go check that out I've
added this to it it's really important
to use either an eye cream or an eye gel
because when you're washing your face
and you're rubbing your eyes trying to
get the makeup off or if you're using
say a makeup wipe to wipe it off it's
really stretching out the skin around
your eyes and it that's what causes
wrinkles I don't really know all the
scientific stuff about it but I do know
that I love this and it makes my eyes
feel more awake it like kind of like
tightens them as well so I'm a big fan
of this again it's by Michael Todd and
this is what it comes in and it's gonna
has rubus tea in it and I used to
actually get that Starbucks so I think
the name kind of sold me on that and
also by Michael Todd I got this new it's
a face wash on a toner and one which is
awesome because I was using a face wash
and a separate toner so to have
something that does both in one it just
saves a lot of time and this one it's
called cleanse and tone one-step
cleanser toner cleans tones and
neutralizes impurities for normal to
oily and combination skins so what's
good about that is no matter what kind
of skin you have for me I guess I kind
of have combination skin sometimes it's
oily sometimes it's dry so this I've
been really happy with I've been using
it for about three weeks now and
so that's the updates on that now for a
clothing haul okay so basically I'm a
clothing hoarder and I know a lot of you
ask about the clothes I wear and I
always post them the thing is with a lot
of these websites because online
shopping has become I guess so much more
popular things go really really quickly
so if you want comment below let me know
if you want me to start doing more
clothing walls because I'll buy
something and then by the time next week
when I'll wear it it's already gone so
if you want I can start doing maybe more
hauls and I can show you guys more
up-to-date stuff but recently I did go
shopping and I got a few things that I
would like to show you it's perfect for
I guess the wintertime the first thing
I'm going to show you our absolute
necessities and they're two for $20
they're from a store called cotton on
and all they are just comfy big t-shirts
it has like a long sleeve and they cover
your butts they're perfect to wear with
leggings and boots and I got it in white
and black and I'm not sure if they have
an online website I will check but this
one has like a little pocket on it and I
love them because they're like baggy
comfy you can throw on a pair of
leggings boots and like a scarf and then
take a cute comfy casual outfit and
honestly that's basically what I've been
living in I bought like two of each so I
can wash one and keep burning the other
but they're so comfy and then they're
cute so these are perfect and again two
for 20 you can't really beat that I got
this new blazer polka dots and it's from
the Kardashian collection from Sears and
it is so cute I love it I have not worn
it yet but as you can see it's lost the
tag on it but the thing I love about
their collection is they're always on
sale like if you go and they're always
like 30% off it's a great price and they
always have really really cute stuff I
have a whole bunch of thing from their
collection and this I can't wait to wear
it's perfect for winter I would probably
wear like red lipstick with this and
it's a size extra small I like jackets
as small as possible because I like them
fitted so that is that and another
blazer I'm going to show you that I just
got that I'm obsessed with that I also
have not worn yet this one is from bebe
and it's a guy hounds
I think that's what that's called in
like leather and zippers on the front
absolutely love this I haven't worn this
yet either but I'm thinking I'd probably
wear this with like a high ponytail
black scarf and like black jeans and
this one I got in a size zero again
because I just like the jackets really
fitting form-fitting so that was that
I love Blazers Blazers are perfect for
winter I feel like if you put on Blazers
and jeans and a scarf you're like set so
I know forever 21 H&amp;amp;M they have amazing
Blazers I have a whole bunch from there
in my mall there's a store called no
style and I know I've talked about it a
bunch and I'm so excited because they
finally made an online website it snow
style USA I'll put the links below but I
got this shirt from there I love this
shirt it's so cute it's like a black
lace top and it has like a pearl collar
and it was inexpensive it doesn't have
the price on it anymore but I think it
was only like $20 and again they have
the website now I'm not sure if it's
still up there but I love this it has
the button down front and this again I
would probably wear with red lips so H&amp;amp;M
always has like the best leather pants
these are the ones that I just recently
got burgundy and they have like leather
sides and they're stretchy they have
zipper front and then the back is a
zipper as well I have not worn these yet
either and they're definitely very
different but I love them and I think
was like a pair of boots and like a
black jacket this would look really
really cute I love this color for fall I
mean it goes good with my lipstick too
the last thing that I want to show you
today is this really cute romper that I
got from ASOS they have the cutest stuff
on ASOS so again with these websites
everything does go quickly so just keep
checking back this is from ASOS
it is a 1 sleeved romper I don't know if
you could really see but I saw this and
it looked so cute I feel like for the
holidays with a pair of black stockings
and boots and like a jacket over it I
really love this I can't wait to wear it
so those are the newest things that I've
purchased this dress that I'm also
wearing right now this is from I believe
it's from Toby they have awesome stuff
there that's also one of my other
favorite websites and
love this color obviously it does match
my new lipstick which I'm really excited
that I found a duplicate to rebel
because I know the MAC lipsticks do get
expensive so these again I think are
only like four or five dollars and yeah
so that was my first pretty big haul I
hope you guys enjoyed if you want to see
more of those let me know and yeah I'll
talk to you guys soon
listen
