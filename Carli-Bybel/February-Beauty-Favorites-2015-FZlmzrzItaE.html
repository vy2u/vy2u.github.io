today's video I'm going to talk about
some of my recent favorites first I just
wanted to say thank you guys so much for
the amazing feedback on my last video it
made me so happy seeing all your
comments and seeing how much it helped
you and it just goes to show if you were
looking through some of those comments
that all of us are going through
something and it's so nice that we can
let it all out on YouTube and just talk
about it and talk to each other and just
give each other advice and I think
that's an amazing thing so thank you
guys and I love you so much but if you
guys want to hear some of my monthly
favorites please keep watching so start
off this video I just want to show you
guys one of the new Cinderella matte
collection powders it's called a beauty
powder this one is called mystery
princess and like how I did my nails to
match so beautiful it's a highlighting
powder when i swatched it on my finger I
was like oh I guess since they paid more
money for the packaging the products not
gonna be as good but when I actually
applied it as a highlighter I was so
happy with how it turned out I'm wearing
it today and I think it's so beautiful
so I know favorites videos are supposed
to be something that I've been using for
a while but I can definitely say that
this is gonna be one of my new favorites
and plus look at the packaging like Mac
is so genius this is just so beautiful
and obsessed clearly because I painted
my nails after it so I just wanted to
talk about this first because I posted a
picture last night of all the products
that I got from the collection and a lot
of you guys were loving it so I think
this is definitely my favorite of all of
them I'm still waiting for my lipsticks
to come in they were sold out online
when I got them and I won't be around on
March 5th when the collection drops so I
just went on eBay and I bought the two
lipsticks and I paid a little bit more
for them than I should have so gotta
love Mac and you gotta love how their
collections sell out instantly so the
next thing I wanted to talk about is
this new perfume by Vince Camuto I don't
know the actual name of it it just came
like this one of my friends actually
works for Vince Camuto so she sent me a
couple of things from them it smell
so delicious every time I wear it Bret's
like oh my god you smell really good and
I'm like thanks babe it's the Vince
Camuto I rarely ever talk about perfumes
because I've just always been the type
to just kind of go to my local Walgreens
and just kind of pick up a bunch of
little sprays and throw them in my purse
but this perfume is so beautiful and I'm
obsessed with it next up I have the
ultra Repair Cream from first in beauty
and this is a body cream i've been using
the Eucerin
skin lotion for I don't know four years
now I've always used the Eucerin because
it's fragrance free and it's great for
sensitive skin I have eczema and I have
very sensitive skin so I've always stuck
with the Eastern because it was just
always safe for me this one I got I
would say about three months ago and I
tried it out and the reason that I
wanted to switch over from it was
because even though I was using you stir
and I was still getting really itchy so
I was like well let me try and find a
new lotion that works really good this
one is amazing it says it right on the
label that it's good for minor
irritation and itching due to eczema and
other conditions for the face and
elsewhere sorry I have an itch as soon
as I get out of the shower I just wipe
it all over my body it is fragrance free
but it has a little bit of like a clean
fresh smell the next thing that I want
to talk about is something that I
actually just bought a new one of
because it went super quick plus I
accidentally tipped it over and some of
it poured out in my last bottle but this
is the model in a bottle long-lasting
eyebrow sealer and this stuff is amazing
to keep your eyebrows in place I was
loving the anastacio clear brow gel but
that's also empty so I need to get
another one of those but in the meantime
I've been using this one it's like just
liquid and when you put it on it's like
hairspray for your eyebrows so for those
of you guys who fill in your brows or
for those of you guys that want to have
your brows just stand up and just stay
in place all day this stuff is
incredible literally I don't know why I
haven't talked about it sooner but I'm
obsessed with it and that you can get
this right on Amazon the next product is
incredible smells incredible it's
definitely on the pricey side but I have
been loving it lately when I had her
OSHA's workshop where she used me as her
model she used this for the more natural
look as a skin base and then also to
give your face like a really dewy glow
but when she applied on me and I smelt
it I was like oh my god like if I'm
gonna buy anything this is something
that I need so I've been using this the
past two weeks and not only does it
smell amazing about what I like to do
and how I like to apply it is I use a
damp Beauty Blender I dip it in and I
just apply it all over my face and it
feels nice and cold and it smells so
good and it really wakes you up
it's the vitamin enriched base base and
has shea butter vitamin C and E and yeah
I guess that's really the only thing
that it's called but it comes in this
cute little jar I wish you guys can like
smell it through the camera but um it's
so delicious it makes your face feel so
fresh and clean and it gives you a nice
little glow but as far as a drugstore
duplicate I have yet to find anything
like this if I do I will definitely keep
you guys updated so next up I have my
color pop the blush in the color holiday
they sent me a bunch of blushes like
probably about ten of them and they're
so beautiful I'm in love with them
this one I've been using literally
almost everyday it's like a perfect
peachy pink color it goes on really
nicely it's not too heavy so you can
just dip your brush in it a few times
apply it and it's not gonna give you
like that excess powder where it's like
too much where you have to really blend
it you just need a little bit and it
goes on perfectly so next I have these
little makeup sponges these ones you can
get rid of your drugstore their studio
Beauty cosmetic wedges um it says with
vitamin E which I didn't even realize
does that mean there's vitamin e and
then that's crazy I switched between
this and the beauty blender to apply the
loose powder underneath my eyes to
really set the concealer and to prevent
it from creasing these are super
affordable and you can use them for
foundation concealer blush eye shadow
blah blah blah blah blah there's a
million different uses for them I have
yet to try applying foundation or
anything with them but I love it to
apply the powder because it has a nice
flat edge so it makes it go on nice and
even the next product I have is the Kat
Von D shade and light palette I know so
many people were asking me to do a
hit-or-miss video on this so I think I
will definitely do that because it's
definitely one of my favorites at the
moment so if you guys want to see the
hit or miss video on this so I can
really go in-depth show you guys
swatches talk about it fully let me know
I think everybody needs a nice highlight
contour palette in their kit so I love
this one I also love the Anastasia
contour kit but I think I mentioned it
in like 10 favorites already so I've
been trying out this one so wanna use
today the contour and I really love the
shades that they chose for this
especially for the contour shades so my
next favorite is of course my Carli lash
had to include it I'm wearing it today
for those of you guys that haven't seen
it here's a nice close-up view of it I
just am in love with these lashes I'm
thinking about doing like a day-to-night
look with these lashes just to show you
guys that they can go from a very simple
look to something really really dramatic
they also come with a little pamphlet
with a nice little hanger and note from
me and then also a nice little quote on
the back so I just wanted to quickly
mention those because I don't think I've
mentioned those in a favorite video yet
but I'm loving them thank you guys for
all the amazing pictures it's so awesome
seeing everybody wearing them seeing
them on different eye shapes different
eye colors just different faces in
general and just seeing how gorgeous
they look on all of you so I'm so happy
you guys are loving them so yes the
Carli lashes are a must-have in my
opinion the next product is by Too Faced
this is the prime to end poreless skin
smoothing face primer this is the one
that I've been using the past couple of
weeks I also picked this up from Ulta
the same day that I got
lipliner it's basically from what I've
noticed the same idea as the Smashbox
pore minimizer it's gonna really really
blur out your pores blur out any fine
lines it just gives you an overall
really pretty finish if you guys want to
do like a no makeup makeup look and you
don't want to wear a foundation or
anything like that I definitely
recommend trying a poreless primer
because it's really gonna blur out your
face and it's gonna give you that
flawless look so I've been loving this
one as well again it's by Too Faced so
next I have this new lipstick called
rodeo drive by Gerard cosmetics is the
one that I am wearing today
it's a beautiful creamy finish today
well not just today the past couple
weeks my lips have been so dry like
gross dry so I've been applying my
chopstick before I started my makeup and
then I've been trying to find lipsticks
that are more creamy that aren't just
gonna dry into these dry cracked lips so
this one is the most beautiful
consistency it's very creamy and it's
very silky and it just kind of smooths
out all of my dry lip action that I got
going on I mix it with this lip liner by
Urban Decay called liar this one I
picked up recently when I went to Ulta
and I've been obsessed with it it's very
very similar to the color Mac world
which I know some of you guys have been
having trouble getting because it seems
to be sold out and out of stock like
everywhere the next product is the pure
Hollywood liquid lipstick by Anasazi of
Beverly Hills I am not sure this one is
still out of stock because it was the
most popular one but it is so beautiful
it's like a beige pink I'm absolutely in
love with it I've seen it on so many
different people and it looks so great
on everybody I am in love with their
liquid lipsticks I know some other
people were asking to do like a hit or
miss on the liquid lipsticks I don't
know if you guys want to see that I know
I had just done the cream contour and
highlight kits so maybe I'll do a few
others in between but then I can review
the liquid lipsticks if you want but I
absolutely love these if you guys have
really really dry lips I recommend
putting on a chapstick waiting for a
little bit of time to really
let your lips soak in the moisture of
the chapstick and then apply this
because when you have really dry lips
and when you apply a matte liquid
lipstick it's gonna kind of accentuate
the dryness so again just be careful
when you're using something like this
and the final product for today is my
favorite concealer at the moment this
one is by NARS and it's in the color
vanilla I absolutely love the coverage
of this it's really silky it's really
smooth and it doesn't ever get that dry
flakiness look even if I put a lot of
powder over it it's still gonna give a
nice creamy finish so I've been obsessed
with this one I also have it in the
color custard and I kept calling it
mustard because I'm just silly and I
just didn't realize but this one is
amazing if you guys are looking for a
great concealer that's gonna really give
you full coverage the NARS ones are
amazing so that is basically yet for my
favorites for the month I will be
leaving on Thursday I'm going to Florida
for the weekend me and Brett are staying
with Nicole and Jeremy for a Nicole's
birthday so I'm gonna try and get one
more video before I go but I'm not
positive it will happen so if not I will
get a video up as soon as I get back I
love you guys so much thank you again
for everything for all the amazing
feedback and until next time I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
