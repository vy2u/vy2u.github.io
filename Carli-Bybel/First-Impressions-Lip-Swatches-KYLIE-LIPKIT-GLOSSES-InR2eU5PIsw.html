violet back with a new video for you
guys today
I apologize for last week I actually
have to fly out to LA or a few business
trip so I can to share some of the stuff
that I'm working on with you guys but it
was cool because a couple days before
I'm actually leaving for LA I got a text
with an invite to Kylie Jenner's new
lipgloss launch so I got to pick up a
bunch of the lip kids at her gloss
launch so I can't wait to try all of
them out so I didn't end up getting
porque just like that dark purple but I
did try the candy K and also Koko K
already and I think they're actually
beautiful they're definitely my
favorites but I came with try some of
the other colors out on camera for you
guys
that way you can see some swatches as
well as here my first impressions so if
you can get your hands on that maybe you
will know it colors you'll want after
this video so you guys want to hear a
little bit more about them please keep
watching first gloss that i'm swatching
is called so cute this is the lightest
of the three it's a really pretty nude
shade I love how pigmented they are and
I love how creamy they go on the lips
they don't feel sticky whatsoever which
is awesome
I'm just pairing this with candy Kay lip
liner to give my lips some dimension
next up I am lining my lips with candy k
and then I'm going in with literally lip
gloss this is definitely my favorite of
the three I think it matches my skin
tone really well
the third lipgloss shade is the color
light this is the darkest of the three I
am first lining my lips with Dolce K
which is a little bit of a darker lip
liner
so next moving on to the lip kits the
first color that I am trying on is Coco
K which is a really pretty light pink
shade this one is definitely one of my
favorites I always tend to stick with
lighter colors it's just in my comfort
zone so I feel like that's why these
really stood out to me but I absolutely
love it the second one up is definitely
my number one favorite this one is Kandy
K and it's a little bit more of a nude
pink color it's not as pink as the other
one but it still has that pink undertone
this one is my absolute favorite I love
how it looks on the lips and I love how
it feels as well I've had this color on
all day and my lips do not feel dry
whatsoever and I don't have that line
that I sometimes get with matte
lipsticks so that was a really big plus
for me the next one is Dolce K which is
more of a neutral brownish nude I
absolutely love this one as well what's
cool is I don't think I have any shade
similar to this one it was very
different and I liked the undertone of
it on my skin personally
next up is the color 22 this is like a
red orange color I wasn't sure how is
going to feel about it because I haven't
really worn like a burnt orange color
before but I have been seeing it a lot
so I feel like with the right outfit it
could be really really cute I feel like
it kind of clashed with my purpley pink
top I feel like maybe with the summer
coming I'm going to try and pull this
off so I'll keep you guys posted next up
I have Posie K which is more of like a
purpley mob shade and I think this one
is really beautiful as well I feel like
I don't have anything negative to say
about any of them the formula is really
nice as I hadn't mentioned previously
it's not drying whatsoever and I love
how it dries instantly this color is
just so beautiful and I definitely will
be wearing it in the future
next up is true brown K and I haven't
worn like a real brown lipstick like
this ever I tried one that was a little
bit Brown but I had more like a gray
undertone and not gonna lie I actually
really like this Brown
I feel like again with the right outfit
would be really really cute so I think
I'm gonna save this and use it in a
tutorial in the future and try it out
with a full look because I was
pleasantly surprised with how much I
liked that one
and then last but not least we have Mary
Jo Kay when I was first applying the lip
liner I thought maybe it was going to be
too much of like a pinkish red but when
I applied this red liquid lipstick I was
like oh my goodness this is so beautiful
it's so bright I feel like it would look
good on any skin tone it's more of like
a blue undertone but again it's really
really bright so this type of lipstick
is gonna make your teeth look super way
which is always cool
so now I try all of the ones I have on I
would have to say my number one favorite
is candy cat which is this one right
here if you guys have been following me
for a while I'm sure you guys could
guess that it's neutral but it has a
little bit of color to it so I think
overall this is definitely my favorite I
also really love the red which is the
marriage okay it's almost kind of drug
and I know for sure I'll definitely
using these another thing that I love
about them is that they dry really
quickly a few other Mac's that I have
they kind of dry them slower and they
feel a little bit more creamy where
these really dry and gets stuck to your
lips so it was definitely hard rubbing
each color off in between which is the
thing because just shows how long where
that these lipsticks are so I am
obsessive matte liquid lipsticks they
are just my favorite I'm not a big fan
losses because I feel like they make my
lips look a little bit too big that's
just my own personal preference I do
love the three neutral colors that she
picks for the glosses I would say my
favorite is literally which is the
middle shade the lightest one which is
so cute is really cute as well
we're to use the light but I'd probably
use a darker lip liner that way it
doesn't look so light on my schedule so
it's really all about preference if you
guys love glosses I never recommend them
they weren't sticky whatsoever they all
smell like cupcakes by the way every
school which is just under they smell so
nice I also love the lip kits that it's
the liquid lipstick along with the lip
liner I personally always use lip liner
I can't go a single day without lip
liner I just like it completes the
entire makeup look so I love that she
gave you the option where you can have
the liner to go with it because for me I
know I'm always confident usually seen
three lip liners just so they kind of go
with every color so it's cool that she
gave me the option to do that so if you
guys can get your hands on it I
definitely would recommend that you guys
talk about which color look so it's
really all about preference with you
guys are looking for so I would say my
overall first impression is that they're
all so beautiful I love the variety of
shades that she has I hope more come out
because I think they're just really
really awesome and I love trying to lip
liners and neck lipsticks they're like
my thing right now so I need them an A+
Congrats Kylie and they're amazing did
such a good job and she's so proud of
yourself and thank you so much for
inviting me to your launch had a great
time so that was really it for now I
