hi everybody thank you for watching so
today I'm here with Sam and she's going
to be my model we are doing a prom
makeup look and this is for someone with
smaller eyes or brown eyes since I have
bigger lids a lot of people have been
asking for me to bring in somebody else
so I figured what better person so if
you want to learn how to get it please
keep watching we starting yeah first I'm
going be priming Sam's face with my
Smashbox color correcting primer and my
Sigma foundation brush
before I fill in her brows I'm just
gonna be combing all the hairs up that
way I can see the natural shape of her
brow
honestly this is perfect because I'm
only just gonna watch this video exactly
I'm using my brow pomade and dark brown
to shape out her eyebrows and whatever
I'm doing someone other than myself what
I like to do is just frame out the face
so I like to fill in the brows and
contour the face so I can really see
where I want to be applying all my
eyeshadows and while my face makeup when
I finish the eye makeup later on if I've
done your makeup before you know that
one of my biggest rules is you cannot
look until I'm finished so in this case
you guys get to see the process of how I
like to do other people's makeup and
right now you can see our eyebrows
really don't look that great and the
reason is because I only use the pomade
throughout the tutorial I'll be filling
them in as I go but the reason I didn't
fill them in is because I like to just
get a rough copy of what I'm gonna do do
the eyes and then I finish the face last
and that's just because all the fallout
from the eye shadow and everything like
that so again don't mind the eyebrows
they don't look perfect doesn't yet but
as the tutorial continues you'll see
where I go with it continuing on I am
contouring her nose and following that
I'm going to be contouring the rest of
her face and after I finished that I'm
going to go right on to the eyes again I
just like to see where the final touches
are going to be especially when it comes
to the eyes because when you shape out
your whole face it's a lot easier to
shape out your eyes and make them appear
larger in this instance
moving on to eyes I'm applying my
pursuade eyeshadow base all over her
eyelids next grabbing this Mac pigment
in the color Frost I'm going to be
applying this color all over the inner
part of her eyelids I'm dipping my brush
into the fix+
first that way we can get it as
pigmented as possible and it prevents a
lot of the fallout from ending up all
over your face next I'm using my Naked 3
palette and I'm picking up the color
trick and I'm applying this on the outer
half of her eye since we want to make
our eyes appear larger I'm going to be
applying it a little bit higher in her
actual eyelid then I'm picking up the
color dust and I'm applying it right in
the middle of the two shadows and it's
going to give it a really pretty blended
look with a large blending brush I'm
picking up the color nooner and I'm
going to start by shading the outer V
and then I'm going to be blending it up
towards her eyebrow
I'm going to be outlining the outer V of
her eye what you're going to do is look
down at the mirror that way you can see
where your outer crease is and as I did
with all the other shadows I'm just
going to be blending this in and
blending it up a little bit above where
her crease actually is and this is going
to give it the illusion that your
eyelids and your eyes are a bit bigger
some people say if you have smaller eyes
that you should stay away from gel liner
but I actually think the opposite I
think if you apply it very very thin I
think if you drag it out with a little
bit of a cat tail it will give you a
really really nice look and it'll help
make your eyes look longer and also
bigger once I get the eyeliner perfect I
like to go over the darkest part again
and just blend it out and blend it into
the liner next I'm applying false lashes
and these are the ardell demi wispies
and I cut them in half I think if you
have smaller eyes instead of using a
full strip of lashes if you cut it and
just use it on the outer edge it'll be a
lot less heavy on your eyes therefore it
won't weigh it down making your eyes
even smaller grabbing that same color I
use in the outer crease I'm going to be
lining very lightly underneath her eye
so now comes the part where I perfect
your face I'm going to be applying a
little bit more bronzer where I had
contoured when I first started out this
look on the size of her cheeks on the
sides of her forehead under her chin and
also on her neck
we're concealer I'm using my favorite by
Laura Mercier and I'm applying this
right underneath her eyes and I'm going
to be highlighting also on the bridge of
her nose in between her brows and also
on her chin
set the foundation and concealer I'm
using this new loose powder by Mac and
I'm using my Sigma brush I'm using this
peach colored blush this one is by
Maybelline you can get this at any
drugstore and I'm just very lightly
dusting it onto her cheeks
I'm using my new two-faced highlighter
and I'm applying this right underneath
her eyes right above the blush and the
bronzer
to highlight her Cupid's bow using that
same highlighter and then to finish off
the look I'm using by model in a bottle
the setting spray and this one is for
sensitive skin and I definitely
recommend this if you are doing heavy
makeup like this because it's going to
help keep your makeup on all day so this
is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and until next time
I'll talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
