finally back in my room filming a new
video for you guys today I feel like
it's been a month or like longer and
that's just unacceptable but it's not
really good to sit down and talk with
you guys and get ready today so I
figured I would do a full get ready with
me show you guys my updated contour
highlight routine and I also wanted to
do a makeup look using my new car
revival deluxe edition palette so that
is what I used for today's look I
absolutely love how it came out I feel
like this book is perfect for spring and
summer time although my face routine is
a little bit more on the heavy side the
eye look is definitely perfect for day
or night look whereas my routine for my
face is more for like a night out dinner
a special event anything like that so
this whole face routine is the exact
routine that I used for the to award
shows that I attended the Oscar party
and then also influenced Asia so if you
guys are looking for a really great
space routine that's going to last all
night long this will for sure
do the job something I want to get ready
with me today then please keep watching
this is the Fionna
Stiles mat foundation in the color 5 I
have my Charlotte Tilbury wonder glow
this is one of my favorite ones to mix
in with foundation so just a little bit
so next week I'm gonna put the video
like all about the self-tanner and stuff
that I use since my skin is been like
super sensitive it's been like trial and
error trying to find tanner that doesn't
affect my skin so we have four cats now
in case you were wondering yes for in my
last video that I posted my little story
time video I talked about how we got her
and why we ended up getting a fourth so
I'm not going to get into that whole
story again if you want to check it out
I will post a video right here you guys
can go watch that but they are all
finally getting along really well so we
don't have to worry about like keeping
her
room while we leave the house which
honestly it's been a weekday and I think
the only left liking one time because no
I'm a cat mom and I didn't want to leave
her alone too long
she's just a baby I feel like it's
literally been a month at least maybe
even longer since I've got here and
films a video so it feels cata crazy not
going to lie so now that we are all one
color basically I'm going to go in with
my nose contour so I am going to use the
Anasazi a Beverly Hills cream contour
kit it's definitely a swatch I really
don't remember using it but I figured
today I'm going to try it out again and
see how I like it
so I'm going to use the darkest shade
right here and then my morphe m2 10
brush so what I like about this right
off the bat is how cool tone it is some
of the nose contour shades that I've
used and have more like an orangey tone
which is okay because it ends up getting
blended in and covered but the greater
tones definitely look more like a shadow
so you don't feel like worry about
blending it as and much because it
doesn't look like orange and I'm going
to apply this on my cheeks so I'm gonna
like full glam as far as like face I'm
not really sure what I'm going to do on
my eyes and I know I'm going to use many
palette I have an idea of what I want to
do but this is like my going out for
special occasion or just something more
dramatic and apply this under my lip and
then right here and for those wondering
why I named chai chai because I didn't
mention in that last video this is the
reason I had chai from Starbucks for
literally as long as I can remember
before I actually worked this arm up my
sister worked at Starbucks so I sort of
go there and I would order too
I used to get like whipped cream on it
too which is gross but I would go i
order one I drink it still quick and
then I was order one to go and I'd bring
it
maybe that's help stuff I was and I was
probably like 15 years old so I've been
drinking them but the only drink I ever
get at Starbucks so that's why we need
your chai because I love my child I am
going to be using the color macadamia by
NARS it's 1.5 this is the soft matte
concealer this one is like my go-to
favorite concealer at the moment so this
is what I like to use underneath my eyes
I find that it does increase like ever
and it's moisturizing at the same time
so I'm going to use my morphe g16 and
just apply that under my eyes I'm going
to drag it down a little bit as well do
like that downwards triangle reach in
and also my forehead that has a few
breakouts on it and then what I've been
doing I know is it's like so much
concealer but because I feel like
extreme contra my nose I've been using
the Tarte shape tape this is in the
color medium and I just apply a little
bit on the side like right up against
that dark line just like that I let that
sit for a little bit so I'm going to
blend underneath my eyes with my Beauty
Blender
okay so after I blend out the cream
concealer I'm going to grab my morphe
n43 six and I'm just going to blend out
the cream contours let's see how the
anasazi of blends oh yeah so you can
already tell it's really creamy it
blends out really nice no patchiness
whatsoever which is awesome I've had
these sitting in my drawer and I just I
don't know why I haven't tried them I
was using that graftobian taught for a
really long time which I still love I
just actually misplaced it I started
organizing my beauty closet um probably
a couple months ago and a little crazy
getting everything organized so I had
all like my own stuff via cream palace
so tonight when I was picking out the
makeup to use I was like you know I'm
going to turn out yeah blends out really
nice
then with my beauty blender I'm going to
like roll the liquid concealer up into
the dark first oh come on kind of like
Pat it that way it's not like to too
much cut it down the sides and kind of
like a rolling motion to cover and blend
the dark I'm using such a light hand as
well because we don't want to cover it
completely we just want it to like blend
and nicely so it looks like the natural
shadow of your nose I'm going to use my
Kat Von D setting powder in the color
translucent and I'm going to use that to
set my under eyes and lately I've been
using the Kat Von D brush as well it's
the shade and light brush you can find
any brush it's just this one super super
soft so that's what I've been using so
I'm going to just smooth my under eye
wrinkles and then set it with the powder
I'm also gonna do my smile lines and
then I always like to just apply it on
my forehead because my boy always gets
super shiny so I'm going to let that sit
and I'm going to start my brows so I'm
going to use my fuzzy abroad and the
color evany and I haven't really
unpacked pulling from Asia yet so I
can't buy my brow powder but I'm going
to use the ebony powder I have like the
brow kit of all the colors I also can't
find my eyebrow brush so obviously
they're somewhere together so this is
like the little mini number 15 Anasazi
brush but it's basically the same head
as the other one it just doesn't have
like that cold on the end which is fine
because I have this with the comb I
think that's as good as they're going to
get for now so with my Sigma e45 I'm
going to take these two colors for my
shine light palette and I'm going to
just go over the cream contour for my
nose and also my cheeks
I'm using my Sigma e-40 brush a third
shade in my new Carli bybel deluxe
edition palette I'm going to be applying
that right into my crease now I'd
normally don't ever wear eyeshadow
primer I just kind of have concealer on
my eyes and then I go from there so if
you guys prefer primer you can do that
as well so I'm going to keep using that
color when I build it a little bit um
probably about good right now and then
I'm going to take the first shade which
is a lighter peach and I'm just going to
put that like between that and then my
eyebrow to have it blend a little bit
more give it a little bit more like an
orange tent I really love how this looks
like it's the perfect spring makeup look
so I'm gonna apply a little bit on this
second shade with my finger and I'm just
going to dab it on to my eyelid to give
this look a little bit more shimmer
I am dipping my finger into the C acne
Washington AB and that's just going to
give it a little bit of a purple Sparkle
I'm then taking this white eye pencil
and the color I don't know the truth
maybe it's a white shade and I'm just
going to draw a line starting at my
inner corner up
with my Sigma II 10 I'm going to pick up
the first highlight chain which is a
really pretty white shimmer I'm going to
write over that to make it a little bit
more profound using my Sigma F 70 I'm
picking up that white shade again and
I'm going to apply that right in meteor
dust so it's so cool about like all
these highlighters you can use them as
shadows highlighters really whatever you
want so then I'm taking my morphe M 170
- 4 and I'm going to pick up that same
orange e shade and I'm just going to
like make the line look a little bit
thinner and more precise I'm going to
take a little more of that orange and
blend that into the edge so it kind of
blends into the darker shade and it just
kind of ends like right there next I'm
going to pick up a little bit of this
shade right here and I'm going to apply
that in the outer V and then I'm picking
up a little bit of this pinky peach
shade and just a little bit and I'm
going to be applying that on the outer
part of my lid I'm just going to very
lightly blend it into the eyelid color
like that more orange so I don't want to
do too much I don't want to look too
pink I wanted to keep this look more on
the peach side for liner I'm using the
Physicians Formula I booster in ultra
black and I'm applying them with this
little Lily lashes tool and honey I
don't use a tool for lashes but for the
ikonics and these I just like to make
sure they're applied up so they don't
make my eye look goofy
so use this guy today for mascara I'm
using the NYX pinup mascara I'm going
back to this orange sugar here and I'm
just going to be applying that
underneath my eyes
and I'm digging up a little bit of the
darkest Matt Brown and I'm applying that
on the outer part as well so I'm doing
my under eye mascara trick so I'm
applying a little bit of powder and then
for bottom mascara i'll of the buxom
mascara it just makes my lashes super
long I'm going to let my bottom mascara
dry I'm going to switch over the lens
and I'll see you in a minute so I'm just
going to dust away the X outer I'm
grabbing my Sigma V 52 and a little bit
of like this peachy shade and I'm going
to set the size of my nose that's going
to help blend in the contour a little
bit let's make it with a little more
natural and for blush that I am using by
Kylie cosmetics the x-ray and blush it's
like a peachy peachy color blush to go
with the eyes I'm grabbing my morphe g4
and that's a brush because it just make
my skin a little blotchy
I don't know I know it's the blush or
what but it's like blotchy so I'm going
to go with my go-to BH nude and go over
that just to see if I can get rid of
that watching it and then on my favorite
part
you're going to highlight my nose and
I'm going to probably mix a couple
shades I'm going to use this highlight
shape first and then I'm going to apply
a little bit of the peachy orange shadow
over it just to give it a same peachy
look a little bit of this
a little bit definitely goes a long way
as you can see and then I'm going to use
a little bit of that peach as well and
then to top this book off as I never
really do it I'm gonna have to do lips
but I'm going to do a little bit of
highlight on my cheek so I'm going to do
the same two colors just a little bit
right here
and I think barely you've been touching
it cheap pencil by colour-pop look at
this thing Bonaparte
and then I want to mix two colors
because you guys know I never like one
I'm using the Gerard cosmetics buttercup
lipstick this is obviously going to like
go to favorites any time I travel like
always bring this with me so that's
going to be like that pink and then I'm
going to use a little bit of color pop
tipsy it's the lippie stix and it's like
super orange so I figured maybe mixing
it will look cute little safe and then
I'm gone back and then I'm just going to
fade in and that is the final look so
I'm just going to straighten the front
part of my hair and I'll see you guys in
a minute
so now that I'm dressed I'm going to use
a little bit of this shade right here
and I highlight my collarbone I can
think of the word
know so my shoulders
yeah maybe try jumped up to see hello
