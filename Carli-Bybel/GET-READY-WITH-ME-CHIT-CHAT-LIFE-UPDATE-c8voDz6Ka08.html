those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and today I wanted to just sit
down chat with you guys while I got
ready it's been a little bit since I've
done like a chit chat get ready with me
and I just wanted to update you on some
things in my life so if you guys want to
get ready with me today then please keep
watching I'm gonna try out some new
makeup products as well so I have my
touch-up
the silk canvas primer which I actually
used once and I showed a tube highest in
my favorites video not my favorites
video in my Sephora haul and you guys
said that the shape of this kind of
looks like something I actually had the
roundest that it comes with like in it
and then I shut it and then when I
opened it I like scoops all out so there
you have the random shape we are going
to scoop a little bit of this out put it
onto my hands smells really good I think
I may have used way too much actually
it's a little bit out of time
yeah definitely way too much so if you
guys are using this a little bit goes a
long way this is only my second time so
learning as I go
so for foundation I actually just opened
a new package yesterday I have the
Beckham Beckham oh the Becca ultimate
coverage 24 hour foundation so i
swatched two of these shades I think
olive is the right shade for me so I'm
gonna go in with that one but I also
have one that's a little bit more like a
Pinker undertone but we're gonna try
this one first and we'll see how it
looks so I've laid a little bit of a
natural tan I'm not wearing the Vita
liberado which actually I mean I'm gonna
put a little bit of it on we'll see how
it blends out try why are you yelling
so this one nation definitely has like a
thick consistency I'm noticing right
offhand and I feel like it kind of has
like a matte finish but it looks like
it's really full-coverage which is nice
please remember to get your ears just
like if you always do your neck it's
like my two spots that are like must do
and then for my neck I'm blending in a
little bit more with this tart brush
this tart a brush to contour my nose I'm
using the darkest shade for my
graftobian warm number three palette and
I'm gonna do my favorite part which is
my nose so where to begin first with the
medium tart shape tape of course and
honestly this foundation shape really
matches me like perfectly which I'm
excited about because I always mix two
foundation shades I just never can find
one that's perfect for me so I'm
actually really excited but anyway so
life updates I have a bunch of life
updates I go for my final walkthrough on
my house on Friday and then my closing
gate got pushed back a couple days but
it is next Thursday I'm not moving just
yet because I want to get everything
that I want done finished in the house
like I want to add some moldings and I
want to get my closet and my beauty room
and everything set up because knowing me
and just knowing how I was with this
house if I don't get things done before
I live there I'm never gonna get them
down especially with the cats it's
really hard to have like construction
and stuff like that done so I'm super
excited if it's new chapter in my life
when you make big life decisions and
your life is forced to change you know
you just gotta kind of go with it and
honestly right now in my life I feel
like I couldn't be happier I know change
is scary and I know sometimes we have to
do things that we don't want to do
what we don't plan on doing but I feel
like when you let go and you follow your
heart then you do what's right for you
that's what everything starts to fall
together and I feel like I've never
believed that more than the past year
because of everything that's been going
on and although two and a half years ago
when I moved into this house I never saw
it ending the way that it did I'm again
going with the flow of life and you know
if you stop looking at situations as
life happening to you and everything
being against you you find that
everything eventually will unfold in the
right way so with that said at first
obviously I was scared and you know you
don't really know if you're making the
right decision but I can honestly say
that I am in a really good place in my
life and I'm excited for this new
chapter and I'm 27 I'm gonna be 28 in
October so you know like starting over
at that age not that I'm old or anything
but it's like starting over at that age
and it's scary and it's different and
it's weird especially when you've been
with one person for so long but you know
life has a funny way of just working
itself out so I know I gave you guys a
little bit of a teaser in my last vlog
and as of right now he wants to stay
private which I totally respect and I
actually like really loved that about
him and eventually he has no choice he's
gonna have to come in and meet you guys
so but that's one of the things I really
liked about him when I met him was he
barely used social media he had no idea
like anything about makeup tutorials on
YouTube so for me that was like really
nice and refreshing because you know I
have like a whole career and my whole
half of my life is online and it was
nice to kind of have someone that had
know
about it and we can like focus on the
real world not the virtual world if that
makes any sense I have to wipe these
lips off because I can't take myself
seriously I'm gonna add a little bit of
this Charlotte Tilbury
contour wand so honestly I was a little
bit like hesitant to put those last
clips in my blog not because I'm not
happy in my life
but because I wasn't sure like how it
would go over and I know you guys are so
supportive and happy for me and I really
really appreciate that because when I
told you guys about my breakup it was a
couple months after and you know I get
pretty personal with you guys but you
know there's a lot of things that I kind
of keep to myself and not because I want
to just out of respect for the other
person but yeah I can honestly say I am
the happiest I've been in a very very
very long time and I just wanted to
share it with you guys because I didn't
want to have to keep it hidden anymore
because it's a big part of my life right
now and I like to share those things
with you because I mean you guys have
been with me through literally
everything like I've been on YouTube
almost seven years almost seven years
that is so crazy like I could cry
thinking about it like I've literally
been through so much with you guys and
the people that have been there from day
one like you have no idea how much I
appreciate you so I want to open up more
and I want to talk to you guys more it's
just sometimes I don't really know what
how to say it or what to say but you
know what I'm happy and there's no
reason to hide your happiness like I
said things change people move on and
sometimes it could be the best decision
of your life so with that said I
appreciate all of the love and support
on my last video
we're gonna move on to brows this always
happens with my brow is like one side
breaks and then I run out of the eyebrow
pencil on the other side so I keep both
around so I can brush my brows and then
fill them in at the same time this is
the anasazi eyebrow is an ebony my go-to
holy grail eyebrow product
I'm not unpacked I had to go into my car
to grab my makeup because it was still
in there from when I got home on Sunday
I haven't done my makeup since I've been
home so like I mentioned I'm probably
not going to be moving into the new
place for another month or two I have
not even started packing I keep telling
myself I thought today I'll start
haven't started I'm like genuinely
scared but honestly my place is a lot
smaller and there's no basement so it's
gonna force me to like cleanse my life
which is a good thing because I've been
cleansing it in many other ways and now
I'm gonna get rid of a lot of the
clutter I am planning on doing like a
huge giveaway and my friend Nicole
Guerrero's some of you guys may know her
I saw her do like a big giveaway with
like mystery boxes which I thought was a
really good idea so I figured maybe I
could do some mystery boxes like she did
so let me know if you like that idea and
then to fill my brows and I'm gonna use
evany brow powder as well so did you
guys like the drone footage from my last
vlog I swear it took me so long to
figure out the drone I actually crashed
it and thought I broke it which was
beautiful I'll show you guys that quick
clip right now that was really funny and
slash scary I it crashed into the woods
by my house and I was like oh my god do
I go in and get it or do I just leave it
because I figured it was a hundred
percent broke and I didn't think
but actually still work so obviously I
went to get it because it was only like
the third time that I was flying it when
this happened and I found it in the wood
they felt almost in the stream and
luckily it still worked I was able to
fly it after it so I just had a change
like two of the propellers so that was
really lucky
it's the DJI Matic Matic pro I think
it's called but I love it it's so cool
I'm like such a nerd with cameras and so
many cameras and I finally got around to
flying and I had it for about a year I
finally tried it out a couple weeks ago
and I thought it'd be cool to
incorporate some drone footage into my
love so did you guys like it let me know
I'm gonna take a little bit of the color
princess cut and just go over my nose
contour before I whip the way the powder
and we're gonna wipe away and I'm just
gonna spray at my face drench my face
because it's good genuinely have no idea
what I'm gonna do for eye makeup just
did a really colorful one so I'm like
feeling like I could do some neutrals
but I know some people get super angry
when I do neutrals because I do them a
lot but it's you know it's what I like
to wear personally I really wanted to
try out this like hot pink lipstick
today so I might do like color neutral
eyes hey guys gonna be mad if you're
gonna get mad then I'm gonna do new toys
click out of this video now because I'm
sure some of you guys want to see it
okay so now that they're gone um which
palette should we use so I'm gonna grab
the Shayla color pop pellets and I'm
gonna take up the color take up I'm
gonna pick up the color culture and
blend right into I think I want to just
do like very simple eyes like thick
thick liner and like a bright lip
is that's just what I'm feeling today
plus I have to go get my eyelash
extensions filled today after this so I
mean not that matters I could really do
any type of makeup look but I'm in a
neutral I type of day plus I really just
wanted to kind of sit down and chat with
you guys cuz I feel like it's been a
while and I know a lot of you have
questions and I kind of left it with
like a cliffhanger but soon soon soon
and we're gonna grab the color
unbothered and we're gonna put it under
the brow
it's so pretty and the same color I'm
going to apply in my tear duct
I'm gonna do eyeliner and then I'm gonna
decide if I want any more makeup than
that so I'm going to use my tart tart
East lino
hmm they're pretty even that was lucky
pretty lucky because me Thailand are not
best friends I'm gonna grab my pallet
this one's shattered and I don't have
another freshman up here but I'm gonna
grab the light matte nude shade and just
apply that on my lid just to brighten it
a little bit but I wanted matte I'm
gonna grab a little brush and then
whatever's left on the brush I'm just
like blending down into the lid and then
up again as well I'm gonna add some nude
liner this is gonna help make your eyes
look a little bit bigger which is always
fun and I'm gonna add a lash because I
still have extensions but I feel like
this make the look a little bit more
dramatic since we are keeping the
eyeshadow pretty neutral so I'm using my
WSP Christina lashes my go-to wispy
lashes that I love so we're just gonna
plop these little little guys on she's
probably stupid to apply these right
before our last appointment but you only
live once so I'm going with it ladies so
while those are drying I'm gonna take a
little bit of my charlotte tilbury
airbrush flawless finish powder and I'm
just gonna apply it next to my nose
under my eyes just to add a little bit
more coverage cuz I love a good full
coverage routine hate getting those
little hairs ah they're so itchy why and
I'm gonna put a little bit on the sides
as well over the contour cuz it's just
gonna lighten it up
little bit we're gonna spray again
another thing I always like to do is add
some something to my lower lashline even
if I'm not gonna do mascara don't know
if I'm gonna do bottom mascara yet but I
will use that same color culture and
just apply that under my eyes and like
to do a pretty thick because it just
opens up your eyes makes them look a
little bit more round so I saw a lot of
people asking how I did my makeup when I
was heading to the airport in my blog
with the red outfit on and this is
basically all I did I did I didn't wear
the eyelash strips because I had just
gotten my eyelashes done and I did no
bottom mascara because I knew we were
going out that night and I didn't want
it to smear so I just did it once I got
there so I'm gonna apply some buxom
mascara you know clump it on I decided
I'm gonna do some bottom Escarra so I'm
just gonna apply a little bit of loose
powder under my eyes use the Umrah
highlighter for my nose well my under
eyes are drying or my lashes are driving
so I guess really the moral of what I've
learned the past year year to years
basically just don't ever settle because
you're comfortable your happiness needs
to come first and you can't worry about
what other people are gonna think or you
can't worry about anybody else because
at the end of the day if you're not
happy in your life or where your life is
out or who you're with you need to make
a change although it's scary and
although you don't know what's gonna
happen or the outcome of the situation
it's better to go against that fear and
just go for what you strongly believe
because no matter what happens whether
you're supposed to would be with that
person or not everything will work out
in the end and I really strongly truly
believe that so you know I just wanted
to
like my experience a little bit with you
because you know I was in a long
relationship almost five years and it
lasted longer than it should have
because I was so scared of the unknown
obviously everyone's situation is
different and you have to do what's best
for you but just know that if you make
big life-changing decisions yeah maybe
maybe you'll regret it but at least you
can say that you tried because we only
live one time we're never guaranteed
tomorrow and if you're gonna sacrifice
your happiness for other people's
happiness it just doesn't make sense
so from personal experience I think
following your heart and doing what you
feel is right for you is the best thing
that you can ever do in your life
because once I did that and once I
wanted to focus on myself and make my
happiness a priority then I ended up
meeting somebody new and I realized how
much I was actually missing and I'm just
really really happy so a little bit of
words of wisdom I know probably sounds
so cliche but for me I always like
hearing people's experiences that have
been through something similar because
until you've been through it you really
don't know and I get how scary it is
believe me like when you set up your
whole life to be with somebody and then
you just change it all it's scary but
honestly just trust in your gut trust in
your instinct and follow your heart and
do what's gonna make you happy at the
end of the day because that's what
matters first and foremost back to the
makeup I'm gonna use a little bit of the
color angle to bronze up a bit stuff's
pigmented and I feel like I'm just
gonna keep rambling because whatever one
thing you have to think about is not
like the instant effects because it's
gonna be hard for who knows how long but
a year from now if you make the decision
that you feel is right like a year from
now you're gonna be so grateful and
thankful that you may
decision because the longer you wait the
more you dwell in the situation it's
just gonna make it harder and harder so
I'm gonna take a little bit of a color
crown it's a little sparkly so I'm gonna
go in with this say no more
does that mean I should say no more I'm
gonna use this oh it's a lip kit so it
comes with a liner I have this Kat Von D
liner let's see you sure it comes yeah
and this is a velvet liquid lip I never
wear hot pink by the way it's a little
sea
I think I like it find a nice hot pink
blush with it hot pink
wet and wild blush now I'm a blush girl
so I love a nice pink blush understand
only take my bronzer brush and just kind
of blend a little bit so we're not
completely crazy okay okay so I think
that's it oh one more spray or makeup
I'm gonna go put a different shirt on so
I can do my hair and I will be right
back
so quickly just like curled my hair ish
I use a one inch curling wand so I had
like a braid in so it was kind of curly
already but if you guys watched my love
that maybe so I did like two little
braids so I think that's what I want to
go with today because I'm getting like
girly vibes with the pink I put on this
cute little like roughly top and you
guys what does this remind you of old
school me or no so I think I'm gonna do
the braids so I'm gonna just do two
little braids so I just kind of like I
don't even use a comb and just kind of
like guesstimate as to where
so I'll like make the sections and then
I'll hold my hair back and I'll see if
it's like enough hair drop Amol and I
can't find a comb someone use a makeup
brush and then before I start braiding I
always like to just take all the rest of
the hair and clip it into a clip because
otherwise I end up with like stragglers
and it hurts throughout the day I'm
gonna do a Dutch braid I do have a Dutch
braid tutorial which is a more zoomed in
type of video but um you just section it
into three and then you put this one
under the middle and then this one under
the middle that makes sense
you can do it again so this one under
the middle and then we're gonna take a
little piece put it under the middle
take another little piece on this side
piece I just realized those earrings
that I picked out they have green in it
and my nails so I like doing my hair
like this during the summer because it
keeps it out of my face and I always
tend to get frizzy ER around my face I
have to get a carrot in cuz my hair grew
in a lot but until then I'm into the
braids that's why I did it in Tennessee
because I knew we were gonna be outside
all day and I didn't want my hair to be
all like poofy so
and then I like to braid it down just
like a little bit so that way I could
stay tight and then I'm gonna secure it
with a little elastic and I have like
hot pink elastics which it was gonna be
this bad I feel like I'm just gonna
stick with the black because I am doing
the hearings so we're gonna do the same
thing we're gonna start with a small
section of the front split it into three
and Dutch braids so again I'll link my
Dutch braid if you guys want a more
in-depth tutorial but when you're doing
in the front of your hair you just want
to grab like smaller smaller pieces at a
time that way you could tell it's a
braid that's something I always used to
like mess up on when I first learned how
to braid I was like why does my braid
down look like a braid because you have
to use smaller smaller pieces
I swear I hate putting these little
rubber bands in someone Alang and now
earrings I seriously found these in my
back bedroom I have not worn these how
yours really close E and so long but as
soon as I put this lipstick on I just
felt like the old me a little bit so we
had it without the earth
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed today's video it was nice
to just sit down and chat with you guys
it's been a little bit since I've done
