filmed a get ready with me and this is
the look that I came up with I wanted to
try out the new Kim Kardashian contour
stick so instead of just doing a review
on them I figured I'm beautiful get
ready with me that way I could see if I
personally really loved it with the
other products that I use in my
foundation routine if you guys want to
see how i got this makeup look right
here then please keep watching for
primer today I'm using the Krylon ultra
base and I'm smelling had it all over my
face my foundation I'm using these on a
style and matte finish foundation in the
color 5 also as you guys know I got with
keratin treatment and my hair got on
Monday so I'm not able to wash it until
tomorrow so that's why I have like hair
dye all around my roots so it looks a
little funky and has a pink top arms so
today I'm going to be trying out to do
k'kaw you need cream contour and
highlight kids I ordered all four of
them when they launched I really did
personally want to try them so I figured
I was trying to today I'm going to use
probably medium or dark I don't know I
have to see how they look but I saw so
many people complaining about the
packaging saying they didn't like the
packaging by it opinion which is funny
because when I opened them and I brought
them upstairs is I don't know if you
guys have heard of Pat McGrath but she
actually just her packaging is something
very similar so it's kind of like the
same type of bag but she filters a
sequence and then it's like all her
awesome product inside so I know Kim had
done like a collab video with Pat before
her line launch so I'm wondering if
that's where she got her inspiration
from kind of a similar idea so I I
honestly don't hate it I think it's fine
because it is a kit so we'll start our
key products in them but I'm going to
open up them down so they come in
another bag which you guys have seen so
many reviews that they sell and just try
to keep it pretty short and sweet so I'm
going to pick a person that has two
cream contour not always all over my
face but like my nose I go in as soon as
I do my foundation I go right to the top
cream contour on my nose so I'm going to
use these in place of my cream contours
you might
I love contouring my nose so I feel like
I'll be as a judge of how the products
actually work and this is the medium
contour this is the dark contour you can
use because I just opened up one of them
and it says dark contour and medium
contour so this is the dark contour
supposed to be in the same kit these are
contour and then this has a dark
highlight and like a matte highlight so
this is called medium contour which I'm
confused delicious concepts highlight on
its level on the second disease they
came together and then this came
together openness and see what happens
here this one says medium contour and
medium high light medium contour and
highlight so what my assumption is it's
just in the wrong bottle because it
should be called dark highlight I guess
they just put the dark highlight in a
medium contour bottle which is weird
alright well I definitely want to use
the dark just when seeing the colors and
I thought a lot of people complaining
about the amount of product that you get
I do agree it is a very small amount of
product so the whole kit was 48 dollars
so basically it's like 24 and 24 and
unlike let's say the brush is free so
it's $24 for the stick I definitely
think because it's giving you more
products for sure I mean if you have any
other contour sticks or foundation
sticks they usually give you a lot more
product I'm going to swatch these just
to make sure I want to use a dark
this is the medium contour yeah I
definitely use dark these are the
contour shades the medium kit and then
the dark kit so I'm definitely going to
use the dark I'm going to use even the
darkest contour for my nose on the left
side is the medium kit and on the right
side is the darker kits you guys can see
from my skin tone I would definitely use
the matte highlight in the dark kit but
not the shimmer highlight because it's
too dark for my skin tone it would be
pretty as like an eye shadow base but I
would have to use the medium kit for the
high
like so everything I watched they were
talking about using the lighter color on
your nose I personally like you the
darker color so I'm going to start
contouring like so many people just want
to hate it like to hate it but I'm gonna
give you guys my honest opinion because
I'm carefully the makeup of the product
if I like it I like it I'm going to do
some of my cheeks so far it looks pretty
pigmented that I don't feel I need to
keep adding on the product I'm going to
blend it down I'll see if I need to
anymore so before ever blend out my con
wear I always do my concealer so when
you use an R soft matte concealer I
wanted to use all my seeing other
products that I normally do for my soul
face that way I can give you guys like
my honest opinion and then what I like
to do is I like to keep the shape tape
Oni the color medium and then I always
apply this right down the side and this
is going to help tame down that like
dark dark brown I like a little here so
first I blend in the concealer under my
eyes I leave the concealer on the side
of my nose like the liquid one until
after this is exactly what I would do
with it were another cream cons are the
concealers first
so now to blend out the cream contour
i'm using this morphe m4 3/6 brush the
reason that I like to go darker with the
contour is you can use less product I'd
like if you use the lighter crunch I
would have had to use a lot more because
you want it to actually show once it's
blended so normally like when I do apply
a cream contour on my cheeks and stuff
literally as much as I apply it how much
I need so I may apply a little bit more
just for like a little bit extra I
didn't even need to like if I wanted to
keep it more natural I could have left
it it did
honestly blend out nicely it's creamy
it's not like very chalky and I'm using
such a light hand on the brush doesn't
feel dry or anything like that
Iqaluit using the brushes came with the
writing on each eye hi so I'm going to
blend out this side of this brush
because this is my brush I always used
with cream contours and then I'm going
to use her brush for the other sides you
can see the difference later I changed
it so we use a flat end of this side
when a black my jaw as well as this
something you might be better just kind
of blend all the concealer and concert
together I would say the brush is fine
and you know I'm such a creature of
habit I would never just go and grab
this brush or the one that I use they're
similar in shape but I only have this
one had like this dual Russians I feel
like it's better for cleaning products
but this one did blend out pretty good
let me use my brush I always used to
blend out my nose contour so what I
always do is I Pat the concealer down
the sides and then I like slowly drag it
over
I'm going to use a little bit of the
lighter contour and like kind of line my
lips a bit so now I'm going to go in
with the dark highlight it's definitely
maybe too dark for me because it's more
of a crown so I'm going to go in with
the medium highlight more like a
champagne color which is probably much
better for my skin and I'm just going to
I don't like to just draw on highlights
I'm going to draw it on to my finger and
just dab it a little bit and this is
actually really pretty I like this it's
very subtle but it gives you like kind
of like a glow only I don't highlight my
nose right now but do it anyway so the
medium highlight I definitely like the
dark highlight would be way too dark for
me so have to get two kits which means
the 30 a hundred bucks out there so
honestly for like a makeup lover like
obviously regardless that they were bad
or not I was buying it as I wanted to
try it if you're on a budget
I'll skip out I'm just going in with a
little more of that concealer on the
side just to accentuate that knows a
little bit more I'm not going to use a
matte highlight on my face because I
don't like that type of texture
personally so I think you're not
actually was really really pretty with a
very soft and blend is really nice I
think so obviously can't leave it like
this I have to set so I'm going to set
my under eyes a Kat Von D Center
so I'm just going to write under my eyes
and then right down the side
you blend out the wrinkles obviously
good under here won't accentuate it my
own personal suggestion not that my
opinion matters she could do whatever
she wants but maybe in the future she
can sell them not as kits and maybe
individual for a lower price and that
way you people can kind of mix and match
by the colors that they want because in
my opinion with contour and highlight
people are always mixing colors it's
really hard to find colors that can just
be categorized into a medium like dark
ultra dark
like for instance I prefer dark contour
but I can't use a dark highlight because
it'll dark on my face
so maybe with nutritional supplements
individuals and that way people can
spend $24 and just get the contour stick
or that just get the highlights pick
whichever that they prefer use your
judgement I mean it's Kim her names on
it and people will buy it just for that
reason personally so far I really like
how it looks I'll give you my opinion
once my full makeup is done well now I'm
going to go in with my on Satya brow is
in the color editing
and then I'm using the ebony powder to
fill them in a little bit more
okay now I'm gonna brush away the powder
you
so this is it without any contour
powders or anything like that I'm going
to go in with my shaded light palette to
go over them a little bit the product
looks really nice which is super
important I would tell you guys honestly
it didn't look good because I do this
routine basically I personally I can't
live without feeding contour so I'm
going to just go in with my shade and
light palette and I'm just going to
darken up my face a little bit
and like this Sigma e45 paper to brush
I'm going to go in with these two
lighter powder shades I'm just going to
go right over the contour just a little
bit highlight my eyes I'm using the Kat
Von D locket powder foundation in the
color 53 I'm just going to apply that
right on my sister side right in a bit
whatever is like left over my brush I'm
just kind of like very lightly blend the
bronzer into the powder so it's not too
too white on an eye I'm going to use the
occasion confused so medium contour with
the dark highlight I'm going to use the
dark highlight matte shade and I'm just
gonna apply a little bit on my eyelid
I'm just going to use the middle shade
from the Kat Von D kit for a round
shadow and that's all of these on my
eyes right which is going to add a
little bit of depth into your eyes it's
a little bit bigger
anytime I'm doing like a natural look
which obviously it went or this much
face makeup and use my bronzer as a
quick eye shadow or even my palate ever
I happy buddy whatever you do and then I
saw her use the contour under her eyes
as well so I'm going to use the lighter
side which is this one and I'll just try
it underneath my eyes I always apply a
shout-out under my eyes kind of like
what I'm doing here I like it may stick
I think it really opens up your eyes and
you do that and then with this Marquis
36 little baby brush I'm going to you
know what I'm going to grab my palette
don't like a shimmery brown so I'm going
to take this shimmer brown and I'm
put that over the cream because anytime
I use the cream at least have some sort
of shadow or powder over it so it does
it then I'm just going to go in with my
Physicians Formula eyeliner and for the
slope I'm gonna pause blend you lashes
on the outer have to give it a more
sultry look so I'm going to keep the
Wayne thicker on the end and dinner I'm
taking the medium highlight and I'm
going to apply that right here and under
my brow this really is a pretty champion
color so never tardy lashes before
dessert kiss Lily lashes like hold on
the stylus causally so they're not Lily
lashes they're kiss brand I don't want
to put them on the outer I used to do
that all the time at events pretty long
so you know what I'm just going to do it
so I'm going to cut like three big
chunks he's at work off the inner corner
and that way they are better for with
the outer half and I have this in black
pigment it's number 121 like a really
pretty shiny yellow and I've got a bunch
of these a couple weeks ago let me know
if I want me to do a video because I
bought like so many of these and I
thought it'd be cool is doing a swatch
video whenever I'm like looking at
products and I don't know what color to
get I always try and find like people
who swatch like all the next to each
other and it's very hard to find so if
you guys want to see something like that
let me know it's an idea I thought of I
just haven't done it yet so I'm just
going to apply this over the cream
highlight to give it like a little top
I'm going to put a little bit of my
champagne gold color over that nose
highlight I'm going to use a little bit
of this Tarte gifted mascara still a
little how to do scarlet eyes allele of
guys they just have to make my own I'm
going to take a little more of my loose
powder and apply it under my eyes so I
can do the bottom mascara without
ruining my whole face and I let them
into like a bright red today so I'm
going to go in with the Kat Von D rosary
lipliner really quickly I saw a lot of
people asking about my lips in my last
video and I feel like I get this in
every video but I haven't got my lips
injected in over two years and a few
months ago I actually had the hyaluronic
acid injected to like remove any like
the bumps and like the remaining
Juvederm so although they still is big I
serve no do remember my left at this
point um it might be like a little scar
tissue or whatever and that's why they
still look a little bit bigger but again
I haven't done them in two years and I
had this ionic acid injected which makes
the jouvert never go away so I probably
won't do them again probably for a long
time so those asking no I have not
recently done them haven't done them in
a while and this is just what they look
like now so and this is colour-pop
creeper for lips
and I'm left that a flush we use this
pinky shade
then I'm gonna try how to do this before
the cover FX mattifying a steady spray
I should have done that with my hair I'm
going to use a little bit of that same
to exclusion means when I tell it this
color highlight and I'm going to just do
a little bit on my chest
draw here's the job
now that I'm dressed and I kind of did
my hair I really couldn't do much
because it's literally super super flat
and I don't want to take hairspray or
anything so it's just I'm going to do it
today I would definitely say overall I
love how my makeup turned out it kind of
looks like how I always do it which is
good so the products do work whether or
not they're worth the price I feel like
everyone use your own judgement if you
want to try them buy them if you don't
don't I feel like so many people just
want people to get up on your own camera
me like it's horrible don't buy it
whatever but I loved how it came out so
it's really all about preference I do
think they could give you a lot more
product for the price that you're paying
and I didn't love how that the dark
color it wouldn't work for my skin tone
I think it would be cool she sold them
as separate or a little bit of a lower
price but hey this is her product her
line and I'm sure with everyone's
feedback she will take it into
consideration for her next product that
she launches that is it for now I am
filming another video with my best
friends tomorrow we are going to do the
maker veteran look like you tagged I
found the key tutorials do it and people
always think you look like anyway so I
thought it'd be really cool to transform
her into me so stay tuned for that video
as well thank you guys so much for
watching and until next time I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
