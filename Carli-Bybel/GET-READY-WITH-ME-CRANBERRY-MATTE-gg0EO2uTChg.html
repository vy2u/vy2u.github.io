today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this hair and makeup look I think
this look is perfect if you guys have a
holiday party or something like that
it's a little bit different but it's
very festive for the season and of
course I had to wear one of my Carli
bybel misguided dresses to go along with
it when I first started filming I didn't
know what kind of look I was gonna do I
wanted to try out a bunch of new
products which I did and after it all
came together I feel like this is a
perfect look for a holiday party or even
just a night out so this dress right now
is back in stock because there were a
few returns and you can get a 50% off so
I will link everything below and if you
guys want to see how I got this hair and
makeup look right here then please keep
watching the sort of today's look I'm
using the becca velvet blurring primer
and i'm gonna apply that all over my
face
for foundation today I'm using the fenty
Beauty Pro filter and the number 300 I
got a spray tan last night from my best
friend so I'm an extra tan today so I
didn't even have to use the Vita
Liberata body blur so that's why I've
straps today I know some people were
asking why do I always film without
straps that's because when I apply the
body blur I don't like having straps cuz
it'll leave a mark so I always like to
do my makeup with my straps down but
today I'll keep them up so that way I
don't look naked I believe this is my
color I tried matching them I got that
big PR box and I really wanted to try
like every product in there but I think
this is pretty close to my shade right
now I just washed it off this morning so
I'm like super super tan but I love it
if anyone wants a spray tan in your New
Jersey or New York my best friend is the
best in the business
seriously I drove an hour last night
just to get a spray tan so that's how
you know it's good so I tried this
foundation in my Harley Quinn video but
I had to use such a light color that I
really didn't get to see how I really
liked it I mean I loved how my makeup
came out but it was more like costume
makeup so I'm excited to try this out
today to see how I really like it and I
know I use a lot of the same products
all the time and it's because I'm a
creature of habit when I find products
that I really really love I
kind of stick with it and I don't branch
out so I figured today I would try a
bunch of new products branch out a bit
and fill myself getting ready so I
really like the finish of it it's not
too luminous it's not too matte it kind
of has just take a nice coverage I would
say it's probably like a medium coverage
nothing like too crazy but I really like
it
I'm gonna also try the matchsticks in
the color mocha to contour which I
probably could even go a little darker
put their downstairs so I'm just gonna
try this guide this is more like a gray
undertone I know you guys saw my routine
yesterday but let's see how this guy
blends out so they blend out really
really nicely and smooth again I
probably could have won even darker but
so I really like the consistency they're
very creamy
they blend out really nice I don't know
why it's taking me like this long to try
the products so for concealer I'm gonna
try the naked weightless complete
coverage concealer in the color medium I
bought these a couple of months ago and
I really wanted to try them but I just
never got around to it so these are my
urban decay
so today I walked into a wall you guys I
don't know what's going on with me like
I went to get Starbucks I got in my car
and I realized I didn't have my keys
so I got out I always Park in my garage
and like I've done this so many times
where I forgot my keys and I got out of
my car and I was looking at my phone and
instead of walking around the bend I
walked right into the wall and I stubbed
my toe and I hurt so so that was fun so
nice start to my day you know okay so
first impression so far I actually
really liked this concealer it covers
really nicely
it definitely reminds me of the shape
tape I feel like it's a little bit more
of like a lightweight formula which is
cool I'm gonna play a little bit more
next to my nose if you guys have lighter
skin tone the drier tone contour
especially for the nose is always a good
idea especially if you haven't perfected
it and you can't seem to get it
lightened enough when you're contouring
like I used to always always use a
grayer tone nose contour shade because I
wasn't able to like blend it out as good
so it just was a lot easier for me now
that I've like perfected it because I'm
so crazy with it I can use like a super
super dark color and I can make it work
so I would definitely say if you're
starting out try with a lighter gray or
tone it's not gonna be as harsh it's not
gonna take as much work to blend out so
one of my smoke detector one of my smoke
detectors needs a battery change it's
been beeping all morning so I hope you
guys can hear it I'm gonna stick to the
powder that I know and love just because
if this doesn't go right it can be a
little bit risky for instance I know I
recommended the Krylon powder was the
Krylon and I loved it with the
that I used in that video and then when
I had my photo shoot for my misguided
shoot
I used a different concealer with it and
I had to wipe off my entire face and
redo my makeup and I was like in a rush
so it was just a nightmare also I wanted
to say thank you to my amazing
subscriber that gave me these beautiful
little opal cat ears at my pop-up shop
Meetup I loved them and I couldn't wait
to wear them so I just wanted to say
thank you so we're gonna smooth out the
wrinkles and then set if you guys want
like a full talk through I just posted
my full contour highlight routine I
wanted to post that because I I haven't
done like a real full talk there on like
why I do certain things and I know for
people trying to learn like those videos
are super helpful so for those that have
seen me do it a million times
sorry if the video was annoying for you
but there are people that do like to
learn and that are just finding my
channel so I wanted to kind of do an
updated one it's been like a couple of
years since I dedicated a video just to
that so I'm gonna take my granite brow
is by anastasiya and fill my brows in
and I'm also going to use the granite
brow Wiz
so tart just came out with the park app
princess palette which is a highlight
and contour palette so I just got this
and I figured I would try it out today
I'm gonna use the color princess cut to
go over my nose contour not gonna lie I
really oops
I really like that contour stick for my
nose looks really like natural and I'm
going to take angle and princess cut to
contour my cheeks these powders actually
smell really really good they smell
really good and they're definitely very
pigmented they blend really nicely I'm
barely touching it and a lot of product
is coming out which is nice it kind of
smell like chocolate maybe it's just me
this is making a reflection on my floor
ends in these going nuts I got to get a
video of this so now I'm going to blend
away the powder I'm going to spray my
face with my queen of hungry mist
basically give myself a shower with it
it feels so refreshing for today's look
I'm gonna be using the new Shan EXO
remix palette that just came out this is
the new side which I am loving all the
pink shades and then this is the
original side right here so I believe
that used to have lip glosses and she
switched it all to eyeshadow so I'm
really excited to try it out today with
my Sigma e-40 I'm picking up the color
bestie and I'm gonna be applying that
right into my crease I wanted to do like
an all matte look today and these colors
are just super super pretty grabbing the
color needs you I'm gonna be applying
that right above that shade with my
Sigma s 70 I'm gonna be picking up the
color stalker and I'm gonna apply that
right on my outer lip
then going back to the colored besties
I'm going to be applying that right next
to it in the center and then dragging it
towards the inner as well then with my
pencil brush I'm picking up the color
BAM pet and this is going to go right in
the outer be
with my 825 I'm picking up a little bit
more of that shade and I'm just going to
start blending it
picking up the color clarity I'm gonna
apply the under my brow bone and I'm
gonna go back over with besties pen
stalker just to emphasize the colors a
little bit more now that we've blended
then I'm grabbing the color Terra Cotta
and I'm gonna be applying that on my
lower lash line I'm grabbing a little
bit of the color of AM pet and I'm
applying that right on the outer lower
just a little bit and then I wanted to
try the color baby girl because it's
like this beautiful hot pink so I'm
gonna apply that right underneath both
of those shades for eyeliner I'm using
the Charlotte Tilbury feline flick for
mascara I'm using my buxom mascara this
mascara actually started using last year
when I got my eyelash extensions for the
first time because this is a water-based
mascara which means it's not gonna ruin
your eyelash extension so it's just a
little tip and I'm gonna apply a little
bit of white eyeliner right in my
waterline this lighting right now really
annoying but it's okay I'm gonna take my
Kat Von D number 57 foundation powder
and I'm going to apply that on the sides
of my nose just a highlight
I'm going back in with the contour kit
and I'm going to use the color crown and
has a little bit of a shimmer and it
just bronzed up a little bit more this
is a really really pretty color I like
it a lot and I'm gonna grab the angle
for the forehead a little bit more as
well I'm not gonna use a shimmer up
there because I don't want to be too
shimmery I'm gonna do one more spritz
I'm gonna use the fancy Beauty lighting
dust and fire crystal highlighter okay
I'm going to use this shiny one here has
a little bit of like a pink undertone
and I'm gonna highlight my nose super
sparkly I love that Cupid's bow needs a
little bit of the less sparkly one for
right here and I'm gonna apply a little
bit of lighting dust in the tear duct as
well give it a little bit of a highlight
so now her lips I'm gonna match my eyes
so I'm gonna do kind of like an ombre
lip I'm using the color notion and Lion
King first I'm gonna line my lips with
my Kat Von D Vampira lip liner
and the camera so it's so much closer to
the handle and she is
first we're going to go in with notion
and I'm going to apply this on like the
outer part
are you trying to go
and we're done just kidding so now we're
gonna go in a lot with Lion King this is
so pretty this color
and then I want to take this lip brush
and I'm just gonna blend it so now for
blush I'm grabbing this Too Faced
palette and I'm gonna mix how deep is
your love
or maybe I'm gonna use your love this
King because it's more like purpley so
I'm gonna try this guy but just a little
bit cuz we'll add more if you want I'm
gonna grab a little bit of these two
together and just kind of highlight a
little bit no so X is here okay so now
that I finished my makeup I'm gonna do
my hair I haven't done like a slick pony
a low pony in a while so I figured with
this makeup look it's kind of
sophisticated look so I'm gonna do my
hair like that so all you're gonna need
is a comb to part your hair so I'm gonna
part it right down the center and we are
going to get all of the hair to the back
and I like to use a brush like this I
need type of smoothing brush there's
hair all over everybody see it any type
of smoothing brush will work but you
just want to smooth everything as tight
as possible into the ponytail I forgot
one detail there if you want it to be
really tight and smooth it's gonna take
a couple minutes to really get it in
there good um so I always like to smooth
it first also while I'm smoothing I saw
a lot of people asking about like if I
move am i bringing my cats and of course
while my cats are coming with me a and B
I know a lot of people were asking about
Charlotte so obviously that was like
really upsetting for me but anyone who
buys my house like whoever ends up
buying it I won't allow them to buy it
without telling them about Charlotte and
making sure that they keep an eye out
for her and you know they have some
extra that should will sit thrown out
for her but maybe I can come visit her I
don't know I really I'm gonna miss her
but I'm not moving for a little bit the
place that I bought is being built so
I'm probably not even moving until like
junior July so I have time and obviously
I'm gonna miss her but like I said I'm
gonna make sure whoever buys my house is
aware of her and well make sure they
keep an eye out for my girl so I'm gonna
use this hairspray
it's my living proof I'm gonna go back
in and smooth again no I get it as tight
as possible because like especially me
it makes my head look even bigger than a
dirty is if it's not like really really
really tight
I'm gonna spray it again and I just use
my comb to make sure it's flat another
little trick that I like to do is I use
my Anasazi a clear brow gel and I'll do
the front part so I'll get like my
sideburns and then like the front pieces
and it stays so perfectly so I'm gonna
just take a couple bobby pins and just
pin any parts that are looking a little
lumpy
so I'm gonna go find an outfit and I'll
be right back so this is the final
result I hope you guys enjoyed this
