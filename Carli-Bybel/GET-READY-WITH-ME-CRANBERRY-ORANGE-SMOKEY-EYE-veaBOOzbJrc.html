today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this full face makeup look right
here it's been so long since I've done a
makeup video full face one at that but
today I'm back so if you want to see how
I do my full face routine as well as how
to get this eye makeup look right here
then please keep watching to start off
today's look I'm going to be
moisturizing my face I just got this
Charlotte Tilbury magic cream and like
this Big Mama size and I'm just going to
be applying a little bit from whatever's
left on this about that much like to
prime my face I'm using Too Faced
hangover primer so for a foundation I'm
using my graftobian warm palette I
actually just ordered a new one
yesterday because all my colors are
almost gone so I wanted to do like a
chitchat get ready with me today because
it's been a little bit since I've done
one and also we just hit 5 million on
YouTube 2 days ago but I just wanted to
thank you guys so much I look really
cute right now August was 5 years since
I started my channel and it's so funny
because I always have the same question
asked like over and over and like how
did you start it like what made you
start it the only reason I started doing
YouTube was because I would freelance
and people would ask me how I did my own
makeup and I really just figured it'd be
an easy way to like direct my clients to
like one video be like ok I feel like my
eye shadow this is how I did it so that
was really my main reason for starting
and it's funny because like so many
people in my home tell me fun of me and
it was like so weird to like record
yourself doing makeup and put it on
YouTube but it's just so crazy to see
how much the community has grown and how
social media has really changed so many
people's lives and I honestly can't even
imagine my life without any of you guys
so for those who have been with me since
day one I love you for those who just
found me yesterday I love you too
I just wanted to take a minute and just
say thank you guys so much from the
bottom of my heart like all of your
amazing comments and all your love and
support seriously means everything to me
as a benefit through so much and I
honestly cannot imagine my life without
all of these so I love you and I'm in
the works of planning another huge
giveaway for those of you who didn't
watch my last video I broke my nail
literally like right down here like so
far down so I probably will have this
bandaid on my finger for like two weeks
until my nail actually can grow out and
I can take my tip off it's really really
uncomfortable but if I don't keep a
bandaid on it just will like fold over
and it hurts so bad so apologies but I'm
using this la girl and toast I go back
and forth between beautiful bronze and
toast
so this is like the shape of what I do
and then this brush really really helps
smooth it out and make it look super
natural
and then for today's look I'm going to
recreate the look from the picture that
I posted the other day I saw so many
people requesting it so this look is
gonna be full glam this is perfect for a
night out so yes this is gonna be a lot
of makeup but I promise my next video
I'll do a more natural like everyday
take a look and my routine and
everything like that so you guys can see
I'm picking up this brown shade right
here and I'm just gonna contour with the
cream a little bit so whenever I'm going
like out for like an event or something
more formal this is the makeup that I'll
do it just lasts so much longer when you
do cream and then powder over it so this
is like my go-to going out or like a
vent makeup and then we're going to
blend it out
so now just came out with the soft matte
complete concealer this is in the color
custard so as you guys know I've been
like only using the NARS creamy
concealer for a really long time now
I've used this the past four or five
times already and it just covers so
nicely it doesn't feel as thick as the
creamy concealer and it comes in all the
same colors as the creamy concealer so
if you already have the creamy concealer
and you're unsure what color to get just
go with the same color that you used for
that
you
I'm also going to apply that right here
and also for my smile lines I'm just
going to go and then set them
and a little bit on my for it cuz it's
super shiny so next for brows I'm using
my brow is in the color granite my
little other end rope yesterday was a
sad day but um so I have my little brush
from this and I'm just going to brush up
my eyebrows and then fill them in
you
and then I'm filling them in with the
ebony brow powder as well so next I'm
just going to brush away all that powder
the reason that I only apply it like
right under my eyes is because that's
where I get the creases and then for all
this area I'm going to set with like a
foundation powder because it gives a
little bit more of a full coverage so
with my Kat Von D foundation powder in
light 48 I'm going to set the
highlighted areas that I didn't set with
my vendek powder so I don't know if you
guys can see much on camera but it just
really like smoothes it out and like I
said this area gets a little more
texture than any other area so the
foundation powder just really smooths it
plus it like makes those lines next to
your nose disappear so for me and my
nose contour that's like really
important because when we can hide the
shadows on the side and then like
recreate shadows on our nose that's when
your nose contours and I look the most
real it's cracking so I have my Sigma
e45 this is my nose contour brush I'm
dipping a little bit of each color and
then I'm just going to go over the cream
contour and that's going to set it and
it's also going to emphasize the
darkness
I have such a light hand when I'm doing
this you don't know like apply to too
much powder because you want to put like
enough that you can cover it but not too
much that like the lines are going to
stay like super dark and just lately
I've been doing like that line across
like right here because that's going to
help like lift this part and then back
in with the Kat Von D powder and just
apply it very lightly over the dark and
then it's going to blend all of that and
so it doesn't look harsh it looks very
natural see crazy right
moving on to eyes I'm using the modern
renaissance palette by anastasiya and
I'm picking up the color of raw Sienna
with a sigma large blending brush and
I'm applying that right into my crease
next up with the same brush I'm picking
up the color realgar which is a bright
orange and I'm applying that in my
crease as well with a smaller blending
brush I'm picking up the color Cyprus
umber and I'm applying that on the outer
V of my eye
and I'm also picking up a little bit of
the antique bronze and I'm blending that
in from the outer V towards the outer
half of my eyelid grabbing the hot pink
color which is a love-letter and the
same small blending brush I'm then
applying that right into my crease when
I created this look on Saturday night I
just kept like reapplying the orange and
then the pink and it just gave it like a
really pretty like sunset type of look
so I'm just going to keep going over
these colors as I go but you will see
that throughout this tutorial then I'm
grabbing my Tarte East liner and I'm
lining my upper lash line
For Lashes I'm using House of lashes
iconic they are definitely one of my
favorites they make your eyes appear
super large and round and doll-like
so if you guys are looking to make your
eyes appear a little bit larger and you
want a really nice dramatic lash I
definitely recommend this one these are
one of my personal favorites next time
pick up this morphe pressed pigment in
the color untamed and I'm applying this
on my lower lash line
I'm not picking up Cyprus number and I'm
applying that on the outer half of my
lower lash line then under both of those
colors I'm using the color burnt orange
and I'm just applying that right
underneath and a little bit of realgar
as well and I'm extending my lower lash
line a little further down than I
normally would
let's give that more dramatic look and
then I'm just applying a little bit of
mascara and then I'm just applying a
little about a mascara as well so I'm
grabbing this second highlight shade
from my palette and I'm going to
highlight under my brows so do you guys
have any plans for Thanksgiving this
year we're going usually we have like
split it up because my family will do it
and Brett's family will do it but this
year we're just going to go to Brett's
side um everyone on my family is doing
something different and then Saturday
we're going to my mom's to celebrate it
twice so I'm also going to apply that
same highlight shade after this girl um
down the center of my nose
and then I'm also applying this in my
tear duct
I like to take my highlight and put it
up against my contour line so it just
emphasizes it a little bit more
huggers and then love
so to come oh I forgot it was broken I'm
using my Kat Von D palette I actually
just heard most support had their 20%
off yeah like her just the new hardcase
kat von d palette so if you've run out
of one color you can buy like the
magnetic pants for it so I did purchase
that one but I wanted to wait until this
one was used up to start using that but
um no this one broke I may have to start
using that a little sooner
so my mom's 55th birthday is coming up
so since it's a big one I'm planning a
trip to take her to the Bahamas so
that'll be fun that's my plans for the
beginning of December and other than
that I don't have any other trips
planned which is nice I love to just be
home and have some weeks to myself
without having to fly all over the place
so that will be fun I'm excited it's
just me and her
going my sister is not able to go so
it'll be a fun little girl stripped bare
why he's like chewing on my plastic
thing so I just emphasize that line and
I feel like I did it too much bear stop
enough you're chewing on my iPad Boulder
oh we got a little visitor you come
inside my friends come to say hi Oh
buddy buddy my buddy boy hmm lovely kid
my fluffy bumpkin look how big he got hi
I'm so Todd so fluffy and just one you
hi everybody I'm Ben I'm cute boom
everyone comes over I give everyone
kisses
I forgot to set my brows I'm just using
the Anastacio clear brow gel
honestly like I used to do this before I
would do all my makeup but I feel like
doing it after is better because
sometimes when you're applying like
bronzer foundation or bronzer or like
powder anything it can lighten your
brows a bit so good seal them once so
I've been working out all new things for
you guys but the dates keep getting
pushed back I the hair hold on like it's
a bear hair yes big long their hair but
yes so I've been working on so many
things and I was supposed to be able to
announce it soon but everything keeps
getting pushed back so all that exciting
news we'll have to wait a little bit
longer but yeah so I'm working a couple
things that have really really occupied
my time so it's been keeping me super
busy but I want you guys to let me know
what else you want to see on my channel
next so I'm going to line my lips with
Chi liner
and then I'm just going to like smudge
it all over my lips because I applied
that agave mask so it's leaving it like
pretty condition so in that picture that
I took that's all I did I just used a
little lip liner oh man I just like
smudged it on my lips and for blush I'm
using by Charlotte Tilbury the ecstasy
blush there's a little shimmer in it
which is really really pretty
until I tone everything down I'm just
using a little bit more of this powder
and a large mb3 marque brush it's
completely gone but I will list it for
you guys and I'm just gonna do like
circular motions just cuz you could see
like a little harsh
you sent my face i'm using the slay all
day lavender setting spray i have a code
that gets everything forty five percent
off for black friday so i will is that
below for you guys and i'm just going to
apply this all over and I have another
so this is the exact make a book that I
posted a couple nights ago I was going
out and then I put a sweatshirt on that
had a little more orange in it so just
looking at it I can tell I already added
like a little bit more orange right in
the crease I was like a final thing
because I wasn't sure what I was gonna
wear and then I put that on and I'm like
uh you know what I need a little more
orange so after the whole thing was that
I just added a little bit into the
crease kind of like what I'm doing I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and don't
forget to comment below let me know what
type of videos you guys want to see next
on my channel because I will be going
through your comments and writing down
my favorites of the ones that you guys
suggest so thank you again so much for 5
million I'm honestly still waiting for
it's like register I feel like I'm still
waiting for like 1 million to register
it's just mind-blowing and especially
the fact that I sit in my room by myself
all the time and I very rarely even
leave my house I'm always doing
something at home that it's just like
the thought of that many people is just
absolutely mind-blowing
so thank you guys so much I love you all
and until next time I'll see you guys
later
absolutely love how this color came out
I haven't done like fake highlights like
this in probably like three and a half
years so I knew I was gonna love these
because I had done this in the past but
I feel like the red is going to be a
cool little change so it already looks
so cool yeah I always love doing like
blonde hair or likes just some
highlights because the dimension of the
hair just makes everything look so much
cooler</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
