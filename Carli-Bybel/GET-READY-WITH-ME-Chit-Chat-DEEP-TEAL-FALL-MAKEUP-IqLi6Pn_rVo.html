today's video I'm gonna do a little chit
chat get ready with me it has been a
long time since I've done one and then
dou you guys really love those types of
videos so I figured for today's get
ready with me I would try all new
products products that I have not tried
before from foundation concealer powder
and I have to say besides maybe like one
product I really really love how it came
out and I wasn't sure what color I was
gonna do and I know my last makeup
tutorial was like um like a olive green
but today I'm doing like a deep teal
green so I hope you guys don't mind I
wanted to do another colourful look for
you guys so comment down below and let
me know what color you guys want to see
next I want to do one more like bright
color and if you want to get ready with
me today then please keep watching so it
feels so good to be sitting back and
filming for you guys I feel nice and
refreshed I have had a very busy couple
of weeks but now I'm back and I have so
many new products that I've been dying
to try so to start off I'm gonna try the
hello fab coconut skin smoothie primer I
love the first aid beauty brand I love
their body moisturizer it's really good
for sensitive skin honestly when I heard
coconut I was like must try okay so I'm
gonna apply some of this on my face it
kind of smells like coconut so let me
see mmm it smells really really good I
don't know if it smells like coconuts or
what for foundation today I'm gonna try
out the Born This Way
two-faced foundation when this first
came out I think it was like last year
they did send me the press kit of all of
the shades I just never got around to
trying it and recently I was googling
like full coverage cruelty free
foundations because one of my favorite
ones is now discontinued so this one was
one that popped up so I actually went to
Sephora and bought a fresh one because
hey I couldn't find the press kit of all
the colors I probably had given them
away so I am excited to try it
nice and fresh I don't have any body
bronzer or anything on today so I'm a
little bit paler than usual so this
hopefully won't be too dark this is in
the color warm beige and I'm gonna let C
dot it on my face and it should be fine
it might be a little dark I only got it
in this color and then like one shade
darker because I literally don't leave
my house without that veto Liberata body
bronzer it's so amazing and it's just so
natural looking so I figured the darker
foundation would work just because I
don't want to look crazy I'm gonna use a
little bit of my Fiona styles and number
four which is my like latest foundation
that I have available so I'm just gonna
do like one pump of that and mix it in
just so I'm not orange so you can see
it's a lot lighter
so yeah they discontinued this Fionna
Stiles foundation yes I was a little
disappointed but let's see how this
two-faced one works my skin was so bad I
haven't filmed in a while um I'm trying
to think when it was like I'm not
kidding it was like the worst that it's
been and probably even know how long I
had one for a facial and she had popped
all my pimples for me and then after
that it was like pimple City like all
over here it's definitely a lot better
than it was but my skin was just
matching my mood I was just you know all
over the place so probably due to stress
and whatever maybe the weather changing
who knows but luckily it calmed down a
little bit and what happened was I
forgot I had bought this new pimple
cream because I really don't have a lot
of acne products because my I really
don't break out that much it's usually
like one or two and it's nothing crazy
so I bought this new pimple spot
treatment and I was applying it like on
all over my chin cuz that's where my
pimples were like really bad he was way
too much of it and it like burned my
skin so like all here was dry and flaky
so of course throughout LA for my
business meetings and stuff like that I
had crusty face but it happens so if you
guys have any acne products that you
really really love or recommend
and that works for you please let me
know because I'm always trying different
ones I haven't been able to find one
that worked for me I used to use the
Mario Badescu one but it stopped working
for me so since it's been a while since
I've done my makeup probably like a
couple days I'm gonna do some full
coverage makeup and I'm gonna try the
shape tape in the color riche so yes
I've used this concealer obviously
before but I've never tried it to
contour so I'm wondering if it's gonna
be too much too dry let's see so just do
a little bit nothing crazy like a couple
dots and you guys know I always like to
use like a super super dark contour
shade because it gives me like a instant
tan and I don't have to go so crazy with
the powder afterwards I'm gonna blend it
in
ah hopefully it's not too much it
already looks like it's too much but I'm
just gonna keep wiping my brush off as I
go that way it's not too much product so
it blends out really nicely so far so
good I just definitely applied way too
much of it so I would say a little bit
goes a long way which is good because it
means this product will last you a very
long time so the reason I've been doing
like three lines here is because as you
guys could probably tell I no longer
have the lip injection so I've been
going back to my old tricks on how to
make them look larger I had I figure out
what it's called that like removes the
Juvederm probably like six months ago
so I have no more lip injections my lips
are always big to begin with so I always
had little like tricks up my sleeve on
how to make them look bigger so I like
to contour here because it makes this
pop a little bit and as I go on I'll
show you the other tricks as well and
now before I do my nose I'm gonna go in
with concealer I have been really
excited to try these this is color pop
no filter concealer I'm probably gonna
go with the lighter one no I actually
want to go with this one it's number 35
it's called medium tan I probably could
have one even a little bit lighter but
it's totally fine
I like the wand makes it easy really
precise application
actually really really like this it's
super thin and lightweight but it covers
really nice so I'm curious to see how
it's gonna look once I said it but I
really really like this and it's super
cheap I love color pop honestly I'm
gonna go in with this brush right here
it's the tart brush and we're just gonna
I'm now wondering if I have too much no
its contouring because of how pigmented
it is but if I have to add a little more
concealer that's fine which I probably
will a little dark I'm going in with a
little more concealer
so to sit under mags I'm gonna try this
Krylon anti-shine powder I got this in
probably like two weeks ago so I just
peeled the sticker off and pour some cap
super white but it's fine
then I'm done so I'm going to fill in my
brows and we'll never ever cheat on my
anastasi Beverly Hills brow products I'm
gonna use granite and Phillies in and
then with the ebony powder we are going
to fill them in a little more and my
number 14 Anasazi brush is what I use
for my brows so I'm just gonna wipe away
the powder and now we'll really see how
these products are working together this
powder is like made for like stage
makeup so I don't doubt this powder at
all but we'll see how that concealer
looks I know it always like looks like a
lot of powder and honestly for the
longest time I was so afraid to apply
that much powder because of the creases
that I used to get underneath my eyes
but I swear it's just life-changing what
I like to do because my skin has been a
little on the dry side is I like to mix
in like a Beauty oil into my foundation
I mean into my moisturizer that I use
every morning so I know you guys have
been dying for a skincare video so I
promise I will film that as soon as
possible this week's gonna be crazy I
have my photo shoot for my clothing line
on Thursday this collection is insane
there's over a hundred pieces it was
just I just went crazy with this one and
for this line I really wanted to do like
a lot of special pieces with the holiday
coming up in New Year's I wanted to do
like a lot of embellishments a lot of
bling like everything that just is like
a stand out outfit so if you guys are
trying to find a birthday outfit a New
Year's outfit the holiday party outfit
or you're just trying to go out and make
a statement I have a lot of fun things
in store for you and then I also have of
course a lot of simple outfits just
stuff for the everyday person so don't
worry I have a little bit of everything
and I'm so proud and it cannot wait to
show you everything I will be filming a
video and I'll show you everything so I
don't know what I'm thinking it's the
powder because my skin just looks so
nice
it looks literally like airbrush and I
haven't even done like my other million
steps yet so I am
this is my new powder I'm never probably
ever gonna go back so Kryolan
professional makeup anti-shine powder I
already love it I'm going to try the
touch luminous dewy skin mist I feel
like I used this one time maybe like a
year or two ago and I hated it I don't
remember why I think they just made me
look too like greasy but I feel like so
many people use this and love it so I'm
gonna give it another chance smells
really good I'm just gonna kind of
bounce yeah like left I feel like it
left like dots on my face where the
powder is yeah it did I'm not I can't no
it doesn't work for me okay so to
contour I'm gonna use the la girl pro
face HD matte powder in the color toffee
I feel like I may have used this once
but I genuinely don't remember so I'm
gonna just go over my nose contour with
this I feel like every time I do a full
face look and I show like how I contour
my nose so many people are just like if
you contour it so much why not just get
a nose job and the answer to that is
because I would never risk someone
ruining my nose like if I knew that it
could just be exactly how I wanted it
I'd probably consider it but it's too
risky so I'm a control freak like I
don't think I would trust anyone to do
what I wanted so there's contour and I'm
just as happy when I makeup on I love
how it looks when I don't have makeup on
I don't love it as much but it's nothing
that like I dwell on and like think
about all the time so when you perfect
it with makeup it gives you other
options - plastic surgery so I'm gonna
use a little bit of this I do have a
different bronzer I really want to try
but I'm gonna use a little bit cuz it's
a nice color
just on my cheeks a little bit goes a
long way
we talk about these cat ears for a
minute I forget where I got these from
either forever 21 or urban outfitters
but I'll link them for you guys I saw
him and I'm like obviously I need them
so my chest might be a different color
so I'm just gonna get a little bit of
this on to it I don't know what shirt
I'm gonna throw on this is not the shirt
that I'm keeping on it's just really
cold in my house today so I wanted to
wear long sleeve so yeah this product is
really nice guys la girl is super
affordable as well which I love don't
forget your ears I was with my mom over
the weekend and she always forgets to do
her ears and her neck like her face will
be nice and bronzed and pretty and then
her neck will be like white I'm like mom
it's like the one rule like you have to
do your neck she's like no it's fine
it's fine so I'd go there and I'd be
like gonna be like fixing it for her so
she's funny it was her first time in LA
so obviously I had to take her shopping
on Rodeo Drive and she had so much fun
she was like a little tourist like we
drove half pump the restaurant she's
like with their phone she's like oh my
god I love that show
like she was really cute so we had such
a good time so I'm gonna stick with what
I like as far as finishing sprays
because what happened with that tatcha
spray sometimes it's just maybe mine's
old I don't know but I hate when it
leaves like wet specs and then you have
to sit there and blend it like I like
using one that kind of melts everything
together so now that I've applied a
little bit more powder I'm gonna go in
with my skin's and havea oil control
spray and I'm just gonna I've just had
the best luck with this one so just very
lightly blend any areas that need to
blend I feel like I want to do like a
colorful eye I don't know what though I
just ordered four new eyeshadow palettes
on Sephora I got the new huda beauty
wine and Natasha de Nonna hers as well
there's a lot of like hot pinks and
bright color so I'm really excited to
try those um colors should I do I have
this Too Faced glitter palette out I'm
kind of speaking to me maybe I'll do
like this teal maybe I'll do that you
know what I'm gonna grab a subculture
palette and I'm gonna use just those
shadows because I know a lot of people
were
you use two so we don't know if it's
good so I'm gonna give that another try
just because I'm I mean my shirt screen
as well but I'm kind of drawn to like
that teal deep green color just from
hearing a lot of the reviews on the
subculture palette and just using the
modern Renaissance
I literally lightly touch the shadows in
that palette so I think some people went
a little bit crazy so I'm gonna go in
with destiny no I'm gonna go in with
untamed no I lied I'm gonna go in with
NuWave first losing it guys and I'm not
even putting a primer on because I
usually never do
I've never have a problem with my
eyeshadow smudging if your eyelids are
more on the oily side you can for sure
use a primer I know it helps a lot of
people I just it's just something I
don't really ever do so again this is
new wave I'm gonna show you like how
light I go like this
when I blend I just like go almost up to
my eyebrow just so it's like a nice day
didn't look I always like to talk
through what I'm doing even though most
of you guys have watched my videos
before but sometimes there's new people
and they don't know how to do makeup and
they want to learn so for those that
want to learn I'm using my Sigma e-40
and this is what I always always use in
my crease and I focus when I dip it into
the product I focus right in the crease
and then once I know a lot of the
pigment is already on my lid I'll then
go up and just do like circular motions
like up closer to my brow one more dip
again that's all you need and I'm not
done with my nose contour yet so just
learning I'm gonna go in with a smaller
e what twenty-five just wiping it off on
a makeup wipe and I'm gonna go in with
the color untamed I'm probably gonna use
untamed in Access and then I'm gonna use
I think this metallic e greenish blue so
I'm gonna go in with untamed first again
barely touching it let's tap it off so
yeah there is product that falls off
when you barely touch it but it's eye
shadow and now we're gonna apply that
right here and like with barely touching
it it's super pigmented let's see how it
blends so again for the people new in my
channel once I dip it in I like to focus
it like right on the outer V and then
once again the pigment is mostly wiped
off I'll slowly start like blending it
in other directions so like upwards to
the left and to the right
so funny I really wanted to do like a
bright color like hot pink or orange or
something but it must be the shirt I
feel like wearing green just made me
wanna wear green eyeshadow a little
depth and just do little circles
I'm gonna do one more dip and just kind
of add a little more to the outer B I
honestly like it just us it is like
super matte but I'm gonna do a shimmer
because I said I was alright so I'm
gonna use my e of f7d so this is
actually a concealer brush that I use
always I am going to apply a little bit
of concealer that way the product sticks
to it so again you can use an eyeshadow
primer whatever you want I'm gonna pick
up the color splash and I'm gonna spray
my setting spray on the mirror and dip
my brush into that first so I like to do
for shimmers usually always and I'm
gonna focus on oh it's pretty
I'm gonna focus that on the center
and then I'm gonna go back in with that
same Matt untamed color I'm gonna blend
it into the shimmer
and then I'm going back over the edge as
well the same brush to give it some more
color
picking up my b25 there's nothing on it
it's just whatever it was long before
I'm just gonna blend my larger blending
brush the color new wave and again just
very lightly tapping it and I'm gonna
bring that color into here a little bit
that way it has that pop of color to
transition and I'm gonna do my bottom
lash line I'm using my morphe e36 and i
like a pre thick lower lash line so I'm
gonna start close to my waterline and
then slowly drag it down
so with my morphe m1 70 - for this
little guy I'm going to apply the color
splash in the middle let's try this NYX
matte liquid liner because I feel like
my eyes look weird or I don't know I
just don't like how I look without
eyeliner so normally I don't like
brushes like this because it's harder to
get it perfect but and I really want to
try new lashes today I literally wear
the same two or three pairs every single
time but before I do that I'm gonna pick
up a little bit of the color axis which
is the darker teal and I'm just gonna go
over the outer V a little bit a little
more a little more so comment below and
let me know what color you want me to do
next cuz I want to start doing more
colorful looks although on a daily basis
I'm always wearing neutral looks maybe
this one and one more colorful one and
then guys are due for like a neutral one
I just don't want to bore you guys so
for lashes I'm gonna try the flutter
lashes and intoxicating I'm using the
duo lash glue and the darkest shade my
hand compared to my face my hands are
always so white because I wash my hands
so much these are definitely super
dramatic this one's my buck someone I'm
not gonna play around with different
mascaras today so I'm going to take a
little bit of this Urban Decay Velvet
Iser
I'm gonna play that just a little bit
under just like I do my bottom mascara
kind of so fine you can't even see it
but it's fine that it's fine I'm going
to use my Becca Capri Coast bronzer just
cuz that's a little bit of like a
shimmer in it and I feel like my face is
super matte so I'm gonna add a little
bit of that so this is really pretty it
has like a gold highlight in it but like
very subtle which is what I love that's
really pretty
kind of bronze up so I'm gonna wipe away
the powder and for lips I'm going to try
the bow and arrow lipliner by Kat Von D
so again what I like to do to make my
lips look bigger is I like to use well
I'm gonna do a nude lip today but even
if I was gonna do in a different color I
like to use like a brownish neutral
shade to really emphasize my lips over
line them draw them a little bit bigger
so as you can see I'll do one side and
you'll see the difference so you can see
probably hopefully that I just over
lined it and then just shade in so your
natural lip line matches where the liner
is and then I want to try one of the
dose of colors and desi Katy collab um
I'm gonna open them both I don't know
they're both really pretty nudes ones a
little bit darker I think I'm gonna just
use both I'm gonna use a darker on the
outer let's see yeah I'm gonna use a
little bit of this on the outer and then
the lighter shade towards the middle so
I'm gonna go back in with the lip liner
and I'm gonna just shade it in a little
bit I love the texture of it it's super
creamy although it is matte it feels
really nice like I've been filming for
like two hours it's like getting dark
out and for blush I'm going to try the
illuminate by Ashley Tisdale this is the
color Cabana and it's a cream blush but
it's such a gorgeous color and I'm just
gonna apply a little bit and tap it on
hmm really pretty and it adds a little
bit of like a sheen which I like cuz I'm
not gonna do maybe I'll do a little
highlighter tonight one what I'm gonna
play a little bit my lips why not I'm
gonna go in with my medium 53 have
Fonzie powder which I always use but I'm
gonna put a little bit over the contour
so although you can't really tell on
camera I would say I would skip the
shape tape concealer as contour I feel
like it's a little too pigmented for a
cream contour so for highlighter I'm
gonna try the new mani makeup artist and
jeffree star collab in the color Uranus
and it's like a really pretty gold so I
figured it would go perfectly with
today's look so I'm gonna first apply
this under my brows really pretty super
pigmented and we're gonna do my nose
we're gonna do the buggers will never
now call it that by the way and then why
not a little bit right here why not and
I'm gonna highlight my cheeks today guys
I'm just gonna do it I'm going all out
why not I'm using my Sigma f 0 3 and
well damn
I'm like barely touching it - by the way
the little up here a little here now I'm
gonna do is go back in with the Becca
bronzer and I'm just gonna go over that
a little bit because I don't want it to
look light from the front sometimes when
I apply highlighter it just doesn't look
right on me so I'm just gonna make sure
it's not like super blinding although it
looked amazing and then to set my face
we're gonna use this setting spray the
skin Bonavia
oil control you can literally drench
your face and it doesn't ruin your
makeup
which is so key with a setting spray so
I'm just gonna fix my hair a little bit
and I'll see you guys in a minute so
this is the final result this video was
long it's now dark out it is 5:45 sad
that it's this dark that's early I mean
it looks a lot darker I feel like
because you're seeing the side of my
house it's not as dark so I feel a
little bit better actually this guy's
still blue but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video it feels really good to be
back
filming for you guys I am going to blog
my photo shoot and get some
behind-the-scenes footage but I probably
won't be able to post that until I
reveal my collection like I said I do
plan on filming an entire collection
review there will be two drops so the
first drop is October 17th and then the
second one is November 13th so we're
gonna do it in two sections so that way
since there is so many items everyone
will be able to get on the website check
out easily and get what they want
so yeah I'm super excited about all of
that so many fun amazing things to come
and your support and love never goes
unnoticed so I just wanted to say thank
you so much because without any of you
guys I really don't know where I would
be I love you so much and until next
time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
