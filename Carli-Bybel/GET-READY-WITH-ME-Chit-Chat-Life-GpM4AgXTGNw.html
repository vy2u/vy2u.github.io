Friday I filmed a whole video it was
over an hour long a footage yesterday
and there was either a smudge on the
lens or it was blurry but I just feel
like that is so typical of what's been
going on so I'm back today re filming
for you guys and to be honest I didn't
really love the look I kind of just did
like a natural look yesterday I'm just
gonna start getting ready on camera and
then update you guys on everything
that's been going on lately so to start
off I'm just going to be moisturizing
with this touch-up balance pore
perfecting Woodard gel when I was
staying with mom Nicole in Florida we
went to Sephora literally spent way too
much money we both pick this up um I
haven't used it in a couple days because
my skin was so bad it broke out so bad
but honestly I don't think it's the
product because I'll fill you guys in on
everything in a couple of minutes but
again I don't think it's the product I
think it was just bad timing so only use
it again today oh by the way how cute
are these little earrings if you could
see them a subscriber sent them to me
and they mean caffeine so it's like the
symbol for caffeine so it is currently 9
a.m. I wanted to wake up super early so
I could get this up by tonight because I
don't know what happened to me but I'm
just so slow at editing lately alright
so let's move on we're going to use the
NYX pore filler primer so I have a lot
to update you guys on I feel like I
haven't sat down and talked to you guys
and so long how to get your cats to come
in take a wire Oh
i'ma show me a new haircut everyone hey
everyone I gotta you here good mom so
they both got haircuts off to tell you
that story before I get into everything
else um so we wanted them to get groomed
they haven't been groomed before and
their hair was just literally like
everywhere every other day are basically
every single day we had to keep cleaning
because we have dark wood floors and
they shed so much we had a mobile
groomer come to our house quickly
foundation is the Becca aqua luminous we
had a mobile groomer come to our house I
got the number from her from a lady at
the vet that worked at the vet I wish
you could have just seen what they just
did okay and we were just gonna do like
a trim I wanted there but shame because
who gets stuck to their hairy little
butts and when the lady came she was a
great so what do you guys want to do bah
bah bah and I was like just a trim you
know nothing crazy speaking of running
crazy I said wet my Beauty Blender so I
was just like okay like a little trim
shave the butts blah blah blah and Bret
was like no shave them I'm like
absolutely not so she was like well I
actually specialize in the lion haircut
so um I do like forty percent of my
customers I do the line haircut so I was
like alright well I've seen that before
and I think it's so so so cute where
they cut the really fluffy cats and make
them look like lions so we let them we
let her do it she takes any out first
after about a half hour she comes in
I'll show you guys Sydney in a minute
she's much it's so sad um what they are
fine but her haircut is Cindy so Cindy
comes in and lady was like she was
moving all over the place and when I was
cutting her little tail she moved and I
cut her puff off so normally they like
cut they shaved the whole town Langley
like a big fluffy puff at the end so
Cindy looked like a mess so I'm like oh
my god do I even give her bear like do I
even let her do bear after what just
happened to Cindy but obviously I'm too
nice and I I would never like be the
type of person where I'm like oh no she
doesn't look good you can't see my other
one so I was like all right well they're
both gonna look silly together so bear
comes back in and he looks so cute
so his came out really good she said
that he sat still and he was a good boy
I'm like miss Cindy girl so I'll show
you you guys them in a minute I'm good
her tail
I was supposed to have a big giant poof
on it so she looks really silly me girl
but you're still beautiful but bears
came out much better so we'll show you
bear but I'm sure it feels nice all she
would ever do is just try and like lick
that hair right here so we'll see Cindy
you're still a gorgeous girl look oh
enough left me one me senior eats a
fluffy tail is no longer loves me
alright now let's go find bear so I
could show you his haircut and then
nothing you know very we do we know he
here so we're currently in my spare
bedroom where I have all my clothes
can we show everyone your cute haircut
get the tail so this is what Cindy's
tail is supposed to look like a little
lion boy oh so they leave like the legs
kind of fluffy at the bottom and then
the tail looks like a lion obviously and
anemia well this
you
so that happen that was I think like a
week ago so before I get into all of the
random details of my life I wanted to
talk about my misguided launch
everything was absolutely crazy so I
just wanted to say first thank you guys
so much
everyone who was so patient I'm saying
so patient now because it's over with
but that we're dealing with the
craziness that was going on so I don't
know why I like I just was like I think
it's gonna go smooth I think it's gonna
go great and of course we crash the
website was in like a couple minutes
when I went out to man chest and we were
talking about the launch and everything
I told them what had happened with my
palette launch and I was like I don't
want the same thing happening obviously
because it's frustrating and stressful
yada yada yada
their biggest day of the year is on
Black Friday so they get like I gots an
insane amount of traffic on Black Friday
so they were like all right well you
know what we have our servers like
everything's going to be good we're
prepared for heavy traffic like don't
even worry about it so I was pretty
confident in the fact that they were
able to handle the traffic and
everything like that so launch happened
at around 8 a.m. Eastern Time and again
within a couple of minutes the website
was down and everything was just very
chaotic but luckily after some fixes on
the IT and a lot of people were able to
get their order people that were in the
UK literally got their deliveries the
next day so it's been so amazing getting
steelier pictures but I know some
people's orders have gotten cancelled
and I just wanted to let you guys know I
talked to them about it because when I
started seeing your tweet saying like
orders canceled like one or two days
later I was like what is going on so I
called them and I was very upset I'm
like why are people's orders getting
canceled so I think like every 30
seconds the quantity of the items left
update so things were over selling when
they didn't have as much stock in stock
so what they did say was they're working
on a way to figure out anyone whose
orders that did get cancelled before the
relaunch happens we're going to try and
send like a direct link to those people
that way if your order was cancelled and
you
I can CLE already did get it and then it
was refunded you guys will have the
chance to buy it before it goes on sale
and before any more madness happens so
we're working on getting that done so
anyone who was disappointed will it be
able to get whatever item that they
wanted so just know that we've been
working day and night trying to make
everybody happy and trying to get
everything done if anyone's having any
problems with their order first
definitely reach out to misguided I will
list below where you guys can reach out
to them it's for whatever reason you
don't hear back in a couple of hours
just tweet me whatever a problem that
you're having and then I'll send it over
to my contact over at misguided I know
they're literally working all hours of
the night trying to get back to
everybody trying to make sure everyone's
happy so I just wanted to throw that out
there as well that anyone who is having
issues don't worry I have your back I
will make sure that everyone's order is
handled correctly just like we did for
the BH palette I don't want anyone to
think that if something goes wrong that
that's the end of the world and
nothing's gonna be fixed about it
everything will be fixed and I will do
my best to make sure everyone is happy
so the demand was just way higher than
we had expected I've never done a
clothing line before obviously I've
never done anything like this so it was
definitely a learning lesson we were
only originally going to do like the one
launch and then once it was sold out it
was sold out because it is a
limited-edition collection for summer
but since there were some issues and a
lot of people wanted it and weren't able
to get it we are doing another relaunch
in August I will let you guys know the
date when I get the actual date but I
just want you to know that we will be
relaunching all the popular pieces that
way if you want a certain piece you
could still get it also for anyone who
received the tracking number and can't
track their order I placed a big order I
wanted to get like my mom my sister my
grandma and everybody like some clothes
so I had a tracking number sent to mean
it wasn't trackable either so I just
figured it wasn't tracked and it arrived
yesterday so just don't worry just be a
little bit patient it takes time and
although some people are getting it
quicker it doesn't mean that you're not
going to get yours it's just that
there's thousands and thousands and
thousands of orders and there's only so
many people haven't started trying to
send everything out so thank you guys
again for a crazy but successful in a
little bit stressful maybe a lot bit
stressful launch
I didn't sleep for like two days I was
up answering people and just making sure
everything was going on smoothly but
today my blue jumpsuit and a pair of
trousers were launched if anyone wants
to go check it out
there are still some pieces that are
still in stock which I will list below
in the description box for anyone
interested if I didn't cover anything as
far as the whole misguided thing and you
had more questions please just comment
below and I'll do my best to answer
everybody this is just the questions off
the top of my head that I wanted to
discuss with you guys I'm using the
color ginger by NARS and since my skin
has been really drying because I've been
using acne medication I went to get a
facial and she's given me all kinds of
acne medication but since it is pretty
drawing on my skin I'm going to add in a
little bit of this best damn Beauty oil
into the concealer just because it's
going to make it a little bit more
creamy for me so I'm just adding like
one two drops and then I'm just going to
go back in
I feel like it's been forever since I've
just sat and updated you guys don't know
what's been going on let's go back to
who's been almost a month let's go back
to the end of June we planned a trip out
to LA because our apartment lease was up
so we had to go and get all of our stuff
out so that was what I think was like
the 27th or something like that when we
first got the apartment with Nicole and
Jeremy we were out in LA like every
couple of months together you saw the
apartment we're like you know why don't
we split it and we're out all the time
together so it just makes total sense
and of course as soon as we get the
apartment we inw and then she ended up
buying a house a couple of months after
that so we just were so busy with a
million other things that we just ended
up not really even being in LA that much
I also had a hair appointment with guy
tang and this air conditioning just
turned on I hope you guys can't hear it
so I had another hair appointment with
guy thing which I was so excited about
he's so amazing I followed him for so
long and he's just so awesome at hair
color do I didn't want anything crazy I
just wanted like some brown highlights
so I don't know if you guys saw that
picture but he made my hair look so
beautiful like the best my hair has ever
looked and um like styling wise and I
really did like the highlights and I
feel like if the base of my hair was
dyed like super dark before he did all
the highlights I probably would have
liked it more but because I needed like
my roots done really bad and my hair was
kind of lighter than I normally would
like it like I really like a deep base
and I like it really deep around my face
what happened was um a couple of days
after I got home the especially the
front piece it started turning like
grass seen like a little bit orange E
which I had my friends or a toner on it
just because I figured that would help
then what happened was I took all of my
photos for misguided and I did them all
like in the mirror and after I sent them
all like they said they needed regular
photos as well so I had to redo all the
outfit photos I didn't answer my phone I
didn't talk to anybody for like almost
two weeks because I was just trying to
get everything done for the launch and
we found a really
awesome location really close to our
house but of course the days that we
were shooting it was like 90 degrees
muggy disgusting so it was really really
hard not gonna lie getting all those
photos done because it was just me and
Brett we had no team we had nobody with
us so for me like if I want a really
good photo like I wanted these photos to
be really good and really special
because I mean this isn't the launch of
my clothing line like this was the
biggest thing that I've ever done and I
was so excited about so during this time
in the midst of me literally having a
nervous breakdown thinking I'm not going
to get my pictures done in time the
first day of shooting when we got back I
uploaded a lot of the pictures and I
just my hair looked almost like greenish
and I think is because the toner I don't
know what happened so I was just like
that's it how my supposed to take all my
photos what do I do
so I ran to Harmons and I got like a
temporary hair color so it's only
supposed to last 28 shampoos and of
course I do it and then it ends up
coming out like almost black so I'm like
so it was definitely stressful but we
got it done which is awesome um so yeah
that's the story about my hair why I
dyed it I know a lot of people were like
how could you die over the masterpiece
like it looked amazing and yeah 100%
it's so amazing when I left there that
day I was in love with it but it just
didn't look right after I washed it and
then I toned it and then it didn't look
right again so here I am back to dark so
literally he's amazing and you guys want
to see how he did my hair he posted a
video on his channel unfortunately I
don't have the highlights anymore but I
have a feeling once 20 shampoos happen
they're gonna come back out so we'll see
like I would have loved to just go ahead
like a good toner put on and had it
fixed but I just literally had zero time
I was a crazy person for that whole
entire week that was the story with my
hair also when we got back from LA we
had the people here doing my closet they
were originally only supposed to take
three days so they had the three days
mapped out and by the third day they
were not even remotely close to being
done they weren't even halfway done so
they ended up coming
in days so seven full days that they
were here doing my closet and they still
have to come back another day it was
really hard to get work done when I had
people working in my house literally
right next door to me sawing and
pounding and making so much noise so I
did get one video up that was my last
video not the clothing one the one
before so I did get that up and I just
did a voiceover because I wanted to get
at least something up for you guys so
I'll show you guys after this video like
a little sneak peek of my closet so far
if you want to see it it's not done and
there's no closer really anything in it
yet so I will give you guys like the
full tour once it is officially done but
I figured since I've been mi-ae for so
long leave it as a little sneak peek
it's so annoying filming with this
camera because it overheats looking
really quickly look I lose track of what
I was talking about okay now I remember
so we had our dining room chairs
delivered we had our kitchen chairs
delivered we had a bunch of chandeliers
and like lighting delivered we had the
electrician here he ended up being over
two full days doing our chandeliers in
our family room which I'll show you guys
after as well if you guys don't follow
me on snapchat on July 3rd we had a
barbecue at Brett's father's house why
yeah how what do you mean what oh my god
he just I just told me that a friend of
ours from high school just passed away
literally my heart just broke so we just
got news that a friend from high school
was killed this morning so when I still
continued to finish this video but it's
just completely mind-blowing
right now just call just call or text
someone that you love and tell them that
you love them because it is just so
short and you just literally never know
it's just horrible because there was
like a group of guys and they were all
really really close and this is not a
third person from that group to pass
away so it's just like oh man sucks so
many people that I haven't seen from
high school I only ever see them at
these weeks and it's just getting so so
over it
she's so crazy how you just never know
what people are going through that's why
it's just so important to be kind to
other people because you just never know
someone cuz it seems super happy and
then just don't know what they're going
through any of you guys are going
through a hard time you just need to
talk to somebody you can't keep your
problems then you have to talk I feel
like that we're always so afraid to ask
for help because we don't want to look
weak or I don't even know it's just you
can't you can't live life like that you
have to talk to people you have to let
your feelings out alright so as I was
saying I want the rest of the video to
be silent on July 3rd we were at Brett's
dad's for a barbecue there was a good
baby stray kit in there when I got there
I thought someone had brought their cat
I was like oh my gosh you brought the
kitten like it was just a baby and it
was just a stray and no one will know
where it came from the entire night it
just wouldn't leave me alone I kept
jumping up on me like kneading on me and
I was posting it all over snapchat and
people were like the kitten shows you
like you need to keep him so I was
begging brought to take him home and I
like slightly convinced him by the end
of the night he was like I don't think
it's a good idea like what if he has a
family like blah blah blah so the kitten
ended up running away before we were
leaving and I was so upset like I cried
the whole way home and I was just very
very upset the next morning we got a
call from his dad saying that the kitten
was back so we drove back down and we
went and we got the kitty and this was
now July 4th so July 4th we sat in like
an animal emergency hospital because we
wanted to make sure like he was all good
before we brought him around our cats so
he get in tune up getting bloodwork and
he got his shots his first round of
shots and everything and he came back
negative for leukemia but the vet was
saying that we still have to keep him
separate for like up to three months
because four kids sometimes it could
take three months to show so I don't
know if you guys know anything about the
but I just thought of leaving him in the
room by himself for three more months
just like breaks my heart so if you guys
I've heard about this before any
suggestions please let me know I'm
thinking about calling like another bet
or two and just getting like a second
opinion because anyone that I've talked
to they're like I've never heard that
before like it's not nice leaving him in
another room and luckily we have a guest
room downstairs with the bathroom a nice
king-sized bed and stuff so he's living
a lot better than he was out in the
wilderness of course and he's getting
lots of food but I just wanted around
the kitties so I don't know if you guys
know anything let me know
there's the baby this is our guest
bedroom
are you kidding me beau only does is
play with the freaking toilet paper
what are you doing in here honey bouche
can you say hi to everyone
oh hi look at his little hands he's got
thumbs let's show him your thumbs lick
the cutest baby was just a little one so
crazy how big he already got oh there he
goes
look at the mittens that show how we
walk the bowlegs oh sweet boy
there's so many other things that I
really wanted to talk to you guys about
but I'm just going to save that for my
next video I wanted to get something up
for you guys so I just want to get
through this and for blush I'm using
this one and for lips BFF to buy color
pop
look light is not good with this version
I'm going to try the point zero from
Kathleen's collab and then I'm just
finishing it off with a setting spray
alright guys so I was gonna do my hair
and everything and then show you guys
like some of the new stuff that I got
but after the news obviously I'm not
just I'm just not in the mood I don't
think it's right so this is gonna be it
for now I promise I will get another
video up for you guys and I'll update
you on everything else as well but for
now I'm just gonna go make a few phone
calls and call people that I love and
just tell them that I love them and
again just remember that as bad as it is
or as hard as it is right now things
will always always get better I love you
guys so much
you're beautiful you're enough and see
you guys next time
so next we have the green satin dress I
actually gave the size two to my best
friend that showed you guys in blush in
the mint color it's very stretchy super
cute I paired this dress with a pair of
Adidas sneakers and the satin bomber and
I thought it looked so cute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
