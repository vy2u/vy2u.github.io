I'm back with a get ready with me video
I am going to a concert tonight it was a
very last-minute concert but I figured
out fill myself getting ready hair
makeup outfit and then I'll get it up
for you guys tomorrow it's been a really
long time since I've been to a concert I
was over my best friend's house last
night and she was like do you remember
the band dating back Sunday I'm like yes
she well they're all playing at PNC and
we need to go so I was like hell yes we
went right on Ticketmaster got our
tickets and we're going at 5:30 so it is
currently 102 um I have to leave here in
three hours so hopefully I'll have
enough time okay so I'm ready for the
lineup Dashboard Confessional Taking
Back Sunday say yes in the early
November and seems a day I'm so ready I
haven't heard any of these songs and so
long but I have a feeling like I still
remember a bunch but alright so before I
got going whenever I want to apply like
a body balm or like something with color
in it to give me some shimmer on my
chest um I do that before I do my makeup
because when you apply it makes your
skin darker so in the past what I've
done I've learned the hard bite is I
would do my full face of makeup apply
the bronzer like sparkly stuff to my
body and then my face wouldn't match my
body so it's always harder to get your
face to match your body afterwards so I
recommend applying this first this is
the miracle body transformer and bronze
the ones that I mentioned in my last
video so I applied it all over my chest
and my arms I don't know if I'm going to
be wearing shorts yet so if I do all
fight on my legs as well it's actually
really funny because the video that
Brett's in my makeup I feel like he
picked the most perfect foundation shade
that I've ever worn in my life which is
really funny so I may use that one but I
also recently just picked up the
hourglass immaculate liquid powder
foundation
it's mattifying and oil-free I had seen
online
really popular Foundation which is filty
free so I may try that one out today
we'll see so it's been so long since
I've done to get ready with me to be
honest it's been the echo issue I'm
using my blog camera for the third video
in a row because it seems that the echo
isn't as crazy my Canon is just a more
professional camera so it picks up sound
a lot better so I'm gonna try this new
foundation just because I have it out
already
it's the hourglass in the color warm
beige and I picked the colors out online
but i swatched it a little bit when I
got it I just got an email yesterday and
it looks pretty good so I'm just gonna
keep a little bit on the back of my hand
and then dot it on to my face feel like
I haven't like just sat and talked to
you guys in so long how are you guys
doing you guys doing good it is school
over yet I feel like school is basically
over so that's exciting summer break I
remember when I was in school like the
last day of school was probably the best
day ever so I know it's been excited
this is like a daytime concert I would
definitely be wearing like way less
makeup but since it's a nighttime
concert and we have actual seats or not
gonna be like on the lawn or anything
we're going to be underneath like a
canopy so I figured you know what I
haven't done full glam and so long I've
been like no makeup for the past week
two weeks so I'm just gonna go along
today so I feel like this color is
pretty good it's kind of hard to tell
but I think it's close enough and then
the contour and all that stuff will
darken it up to contour my nose I'm
using this beautiful bronze color by la
girl when I have more of a tan I use
beautiful bronze so if you guys follow
me on snapchat I had to go to the
dermatologist two days ago my eczema has
been insane he's launched
I would say the past month at least it
has not gone away
okay so certain areas like on my hand
friend since it's gone and I was giving
you guys like that update because I feel
like the one on my hand was like the one
that just would not go away so the one
in my hand is actually gone I've been
fine with that but I get it in other
areas basically anywhere that I'm warm
like you could see like right under here
and off you could see every night I've
been up for like two three hours of
pitching myself and yadda-yadda yeah and
it's just been brutal and when we got
back from Florida I was like that's it
like what the hell am i doing like I
can't live like this anymore so we went
there's a dermatologist right by our
house so we went over to her I've been
to so many dermatologists by the way
I've been to allergist I've been to so
many and like every time I go they told
me something different but the lady was
actually really nice and she gave me
some good advice and a lot of things she
had recommended I hadn't heard before so
she had asked me like what we keep our
temperature at in our house and I'm like
seventy-three and she's like 73h like
you cannot keep your temperature at 73
like it needs to be a lot lower than
that she's like we keep it at 58
for when you're sleeping and then during
the day like six feet it doesn't go
above 68 so I'm like first of all like
when it's 73 I'm still wearing a robe
and a sweatshirt and I'm freezing in
slippers and everything I feel like I'm
just always cold but we did definitely
make it a little bit cooler which seems
to be helping a little bit she also had
recommended me to take some vitamin D
pills as well as some magnesium pills
which I haven't picked up yet I was
hoping going vegan would clear that up
but I mean I know it takes time so I'm
going to give it time I'm not playing
whatever not being vegan it's something
that
but just can't imagine like not being
vegan at this point that fresh new
custard so let's update with the eczema
thing I do plan on filming like a vegan
update and maybe showing you guys some
of the meals that we've been having and
stuff like that for any of you guys that
have tried it or needs some meal options
check out Brett's channel because he's
been posting a lot of vegan stuff you
also posted on grocery wall which is
really cool maybe I'll even show you
guys my smoothie recipe that I have
literally every morning if you guys want
to see it let me know and I could
definitely film that for you even though
I don't normally don't do like clean
stuff like that thinks I'm a freak
because I don't ever get sick of it but
that's how I am with things like if I
find something I really really like I'll
have every single day until I get sick
of it so so far so good I've had it for
the past two months since I've been
vegan even before my vegan I was still
drinking it it's just good to have like
a smoothie in the morning gives you
energy and I used to always have coffee
and I still sometimes will have coffee
but I'll always always have my cheek
first so that's the first thing that's
going into my body I probably could have
used the color honey with the little
darker who's a little bit light for me
got a nice tan while I was in Florida
but
and so I'm using that on a star zero
weight I have a fuzz on my face
your thoughts who are you you lookee
bottom okay so I'm using the Anastasia
brow is in dark brown eye just how to
get a new one from Sephora when I was in
Florida with Nicole one of the days we
went to the mall and of course we had to
go to Sephora so we did the movie go
shopping slash makeup shop I think any
type of shopping so he's deadly with the
both of us so we're supposed to be going
to LA next week for all supposed to be
doing VidCon just to go like I wasn't
planning like a meetup or anything I was
just going to kind of go and just hang
out I mean we have to go because our
lease is up for our apartment and in
June which so created a thirty-minute
year but so we have to go and empty it
out we have clothes and we have beds and
we have all kinds of stuff there so if
you guys know it was like any good
places to donate or anything like that
we have a lot of stuff in the apartment
that we're not going to need that we
don't really know what we should do is
so you guys have any suggestions let me
know sorry my camera just died the one
great thing about using this blog camera
is it overheats really easily
so as I was saying me my friends all got
into like that scene type of music and
all that stuff when we were like
freshmen sophomores in high school all
my friends chopped all their hair off my
best friend had like the severe swoop
bangs maybe I could find a picture I
don't even think I want you guys to see
pictures of me during that time but it
was a very rough time of my life I
didn't cut my hair off I really wanted
to but I always had curly hair or
something it's just not going to work
but all my friends had like the very
very very very short short hair we used
to go to shows and used to go to like
concerts and the guy I was dating was in
a band so it's just so funny because as
soon as I saw her yesterday
and she told she's like you want to
taste content I'm like yes like bringing
back to the good old days when we were
15 16 not even knowing anything about
life but get still stressing out about
everything I don't know we always take
the time so so I'm really excited about
this in August we're going to see
Miranda Lambert Keith no Keith Urban
artists Oh Keith Urban um Kenny Chesney
and Sam hunt so that's going to be
really fun I cannot wait for that and
August we're also going on a vacation to
Jamaica me Brett Nicole and her
boyfriend Pat we never well me and uh
police to go on family vacations with
each other all the time like I've been
on a bunch with her family she's been to
a bunch of places with my family but we
never like just me and her like we've
never gone on a vacation without like
our parents and our boyfriends are
really good friends which is awesome so
it's gonna be so much fun yesterday we
had like three guys here ripping out the
old closet unit that they had when we
first moved in which was like a dark
dark brown but I didn't really love it I
wanted an all-white closet so I have a
whole closet that I got to design myself
and it will be installed the 29th of
June is when they start so I'm really
excited I can't wait to show you guys so
I like separated all my individual
shadows into palettes so they looked
pretty so this is like my summary peachy
golden palette I guess so I don't know
what I'm going to even do with my eyes I
want to keep it pretty light and then do
the lashes and all that so see I'm gonna
use I'm just going to do the eyes and
then I'll list in order the shadows that
I use because I don't even know what I
might use like a bunch like this peach
just too light all right so let's go
I'm gonna go in would like this
taupey color
I'm going to pick up a little bit of the
color red ochre from the modern
renaissance palette I'm just going to
apply that in the crease as well to give
it a little color L if I was like I want
to do natural and like the crease is
like so dark my brushes need a severe
cleaning my life needs a severe cleaning
by the way I feel like every video that
I post there's always like a few people
that are like you seem really sad or you
seem really down and I promise you I'm
not honestly all I want to do is just
like work and get videos up and just
stay consistent because I feel like it's
been a while since I've been like
actually really consistent and it
stresses me out a lot I missed you my
blog post I miss doing fashion stuff and
I just feel like with the whole move and
everything you just don't really know
what to expect until you go through it
and I mean I've moved oh by the way I'm
also mixing in on my lid gold rush by
Anasazi I took more like a gold I still
have to go through all the video entries
for my giveaway so I apologize it's been
so hectic but the giveaway ended on
Tuesday I probably won't be announcing
winners until like the end of June
because I'm again I have to go to LA to
get my stuff out so I'm going to be like
all over the place but they will be
announced as soon as possible either end
of June or beginning of July so I've
only watched a few I have a lot more to
watch and I cannot wait to watch them
because you guys I feel like that's what
I need I need just like a few hours just
sitting down for getting the world and
just getting to see your videos and I
know every time I watch them and I
actually sit down and watch them I cry
the whole time and I feel like I needed
another it's not a sad cry it's a happy
cry cuz that's what gives me hope in
this crazy world that we live in just
all the goodness and the fact that I was
able to inspire you guys to go out and
go do something nice for some
so the camera died again so I just did
my winged liner because you see me do
that a bunch of times
Jhoanna for you I'm gonna go in with
this little mini more feet I'm 170 - 4
Oh what's going on down there and then
I'm going to pick up that same red ocher
and I'm just gonna sharpen this line a
little bit see a little bit of the burnt
orange while we're in this palette I'm
just gonna blend we're gonna be a cramp
got a background for lashes I'm using
the WFP
French hairy lashes these are like my
time is it 1 for 3 1:43 um I don't know
why I'm stressing out like snuff the end
of the world for not on time um so these
are just the ones I always wear when I
don't want anything crazy they're just
easy to throw on I know they're gonna
look good
I always have to snip them a little bit
just in the inner because they're a tad
bit long if you're wearing false lashes
and you know you're going to be out all
night go go bring up some glue with you
in your purse I can't tell you how many
times I've had to make breath stop on
the way out wherever we're going because
on the way in the car my eyelash lifted
in the corner just always bring it with
you otherwise you're going to have 900
bottles of them and not know what to do
with it all and then we're under the I
try a little bit of this color glisten
and then I'm picking up topaz
mascara this is the only one that I've
found so far
that's cruelty free that I can live with
although I still hoping for something
better you know we will just to create
something a little bit better
one thing that I've been working on for
the past year is going to be launching
it's gonna push back a little bit to
like the beginning like week or two of
July just for there was just a little
bit of a hold up with some of the I
can't even say what but I can't make
sure you guys oh it was so crazy two
months I can talk about it I'll tell you
the whole story on how it happened and
all that stuff taking this Sigma II 52
brush with this peach shade from my Kat
Von D kit and I'm just going over the
nose contour so it's not so harsh that's
there for me I'm using my M oh no sorry
b07 round contour by I don't know the
name of the company it says D /b so I'll
look into it for you guys I'm gonna use
the middle Brown just do this
like the tannest I've been in two years
I'm like picking up a little bit of the
darkest contour shade I'm like shocked
then I'm rushing this is me rushing home
when we got I'm like so you know this is
a real get ready with me I'm really
getting ready and I really gotta go I'm
gonna use the blush that I always use
because it's out I don't know if I have
another one anywhere near me I'm going
to mix this in this on my cheeks my face
is still looking a little paler than my
body
you can take a little bit of the medium
shade bronzer and just kind of bronze a
little bit more for highlighter I have
my top favorite I'm going to use the
pinky pinky gold pinky nice a pink one
I'm gonna call mix in a little bit of
the gold I shout out from my palette it
just always stays the best for my nose
I've tried a bunch of others and then I
noticed like about time I leave it's not
shiny anymore
I know everyone hates us but still
feeling it everyone thinks it looks like
boogers I don't understand like I don't
think it looks that bad because I prefer
it there then maybe I'll put a little on
my cheeks and be outside why not
it's really good for the face what am i
different lips though BFF by colour-pop
look at this apply a little bit of the
kylie air mat for a little shimmer and
pure Hollywood over that's too late I
don't know that light hang on and I'm
going to mix in a little bit of a beeper
I always like to mix lips I'd never like
just loved one lip color that much the
outer and I'm going to use like a little
lip brush to blend it
I can see the original Kiley long so
maybe you could skip that one and then
I'm going to take some of my gold pilot
are
and then on about
see you can make your own mandala play
I'm gonna do my heart because we don't
got right so i snapchatted and ask what
actually with my hair and I tell you
guys to tweet me and I'm seeing a lot of
ways and braids natural ways beachy
waves car light so I guess I'm just
gonna go with some waves which I was
kind of thinking that anyway so I'm just
gonna section off my hair front sorry
about this shirt situation I got going
on and I'm going to start pieces when
I'm doing like the bottom pieces I
always grab like bigger sections like
the top pieces I like a little bit
carlier so those one is my Bellamy by
the way it's a little pink one I'm gonna
repeat on the same side and then I'll be
back because my camera's gonna overheat
so the bottom layer as you guys saw I
just curled and left down the middle
layer I pinned up because my hair is
just super flat and I wanted a little
bit of body so I'm gonna pin knees up
and then while I search for my outfit
I'm gonna leave them in let them cool
and then we'll pull them down so for the
top piece you know a lot of people like
to always see like the top so I'm gonna
split it into two and I'm going to take
this back section because this is a
piece that I like to go back scalp
burned while I was in Florida so if you
see skin it's just dry skin that's all
that it is so I'm just wrapping it
around and I keep it like the barrel
facing back that way the hair falls back
that way I need a haircut very bad I
need some layers I need some angles and
a new color so yeah don't mind the hair
work in progress
and zeal and then I have my little bobby
pins I'm just going to pin it up like
that then take another piece section up
into two and grow
and all these front pieces I'm going
back as well I'm curling it back away
from my face
if you guys have like shorter layers and
your hair curls a lot easier you can if
in you want like big beachy waves you
can skip like the whole pinning up the
reason I've been pinning it up lately is
because my hair is so long it's very
heavy and it gets weighed down and like
all my angles and all my layers kind of
grew out so normally if I want to just
curl it spray it I'd be good but again
since it's so long and heavy I have to
pin it up if I wanted to say
so I finally I don't know if I've told
you guys I finally ordered a couch
I had a couch that I was going to buy
and I was pretty much about to order it
and then I just wanted to make sure
before I bought it that I was gonna love
it and this is the couch that's in from
my beauty room so I know I've been
taking like those near pics or whatever
and my rooms completely empty so I
ordered a couch and I also ordered a new
vanity chair so hopefully those comes
sooner than later I'm really excited to
show it to you guys so I can't wait to
decorate this room I have so many
different ideas in mind I'm gonna do a
couch and then do a nice coffee table
and do some art and I'm like some cool
curtain things and yeah it's gonna look
really nice so I'm just excited to get
like something done I feel like I've
been doing like a little bit here and
there everything and nothing's actually
done I mean that simple process when you
move into your house it's not like
you're renting and you can just pack it
all up in a year or two so you want to
make sure you're doing it right that way
you're not wasting money I can't buy my
hairspray I had like a big white
hairspray so I don't know where it is
I've looked everywhere I don't know if
Bret maybe borrowed it so I'm just going
to use the dry bar triple sec texturizer
if you guys find that your clothes won't
stay without hairspray use a hairspray I
just don't have them today so I'm just I
have to work with makeup so I really
want to do to come over and get ready
with me so we could both get ready
together and film it and Bureau
together but she lives like an hour away
from me now so it doesn't make sense
because where we're going is kind of
like in between both of us so I'm going
to bring my camera though so that way I
can vlog while we're there I want to go
pick out an outfit I'll be back so I
finally had an outfit I called mo I was
a little sitting on my floor I have all
my clothes in like two of the guest
bedrooms because my cause is not done
yet so I was literally I tried something
on and it was a really really really
cute op and I can't wait to wear it but
it was a little revealing a little much
so I said you know what I'll see the
first time where I'm actually with Brett
so I'm didn't wear that took everything
off I'm sitting on my floor naked Indian
salad she's looking at the chaos around
me and I'm like what am I gonna wear
of course I really didn't want to wear
black tonight but you know what I ends
up in black I feel like whatever so I'm
wearing this top and then I have these
shorts they're from : Terry vintage
they're literally like three years old
so I'm sure that pull the pins out and
definitely had enough time to cool so
I'm going to pull these out and they're
going to look ridiculous but just see
what I do
so before I brush it out I'm gonna spray
a little more of this texture like under
all this and we're done just kidding
okay so now I'm just gonna brush through
these bad boys
the reason I like to do it this way is
because since they have time to like set
it's gonna stay a lot longer so I
actually found a hairspray it's not
cruelty free so I don't want to talk
about it but um I just needed a little
hairspray I honestly this is the only
bottle hairspray that I have which is
funny considering you met a crap I have
it elsewhere so see how nice and full it
is and I think I need a little bit of
can you imagine I think I need a little
sea salt right oh look about it I don't
know where all of my hair stuff is so
more textures right is and then you just
get super large and in charge hair all
right so it's gonna deep puff and it's
gonna loosen up as time goes like right
now it's just like massive because I
just took them out so you'll see as a
night goes on true by the time I leave
it's gonna be completely flat but I'm
gonna just leave it super large like
this cuz it's going to tame so if you
want body and you want them to look
fluffy and big pin your curls alright so
it is 350 we have to leave in 10 minutes
I'm gonna try and get a quick picture
before we go of my outfit so you see the
full outfit and I'm going to take you
guys along with me so I am all ready to
go I'm gonna go grab my jacket
grab my boots and we're going to hit the
road it is a 357 omou just texted me I'm
probably just wearing jeans a crop top
not a sure about shoes I'm wearing okay
so I'm gonna tie my shorts
yeah heels heels on the boots
our beautiful unfinished floor that
seems like it'll never be finished we're
running behind as always she left like
10 minutes ago but when are we ever on
