miss you guys so much
last month I was travelling literally
every single weekend and it was the most
that I've ever traveled in my life so it
feels good to be back home
settling in and back to filming today
see guys I know I originally was
supposed to have a launch today but that
got moved to Wednesday the 15th so just
a few more days and then you guys get to
hear what I've been working on for the
past year so I'm super excited to share
it with you guys and today I wanted to
film myself getting ready and Brett has
dinner plans tonight so it's been a
little bit since I feels like a date
night look so if you guys want to get
ready with me then please keep watching
me hi without anything today is by
krylon it's called perfect net I have
not used this one before but I do love
the Krylon brand they're more known for
like stage makeup and theater makeup and
stuff like that so I don't know I just
feel like they're all the products that
I've used in the past are really good
I'm going to apply a little bit oh it's
like liquid just like squirted out of my
hand I don't know if that's right it's
leox helplessly liquid - yes it looks
like you feel what my hands are and like
something came out afterwards so let's
try this again okay so it's like kind of
like a gel consistency hopefully it will
mattify me like it says it will
so I don't know if you guys can tell but
I woke up today in it snowing for
foundation I am using the Fiona Styles
matte finish foundation in the color for
I've been using this for probably like
three weeks now and I really like this
foundation because when I don't have a
pan are not using self-tanner it's
always hard for me to find a foundation
that matches perfectly they always end
up oxidizing and turning different color
so I'm always constantly mixing
foundations but I found that this shade
is literally perfect for my skin tone to
contour my nose I'm using the taupe
color by la girl I love the brush on the
end of this because it makes drawing the
straight line like super easy I'm gonna
contour my cheeks and my forehead and my
job
so I'm grabbing me part sheeps tape
concealer I really really love this
concealer I felt so many people talking
about it when it first launched and I'm
like I wonder if it's as good as
everyone's saying and it really is such
a good concealer it reminds me a lot of
the NARS creamy concealer it's very full
coverage and I loved how the applicator
is super big so I'm applying this
concealer right on the side of my nose
like right up against the ground line a
little bit on the bridge in between my
forehead over these little temples that
I got on my chin too much and then a
smile lines and then for underneath my
eyes I have been using the NARS
concealer in the jar really it's called
soft matte concealers I go back and
forth I have custard and this one's
macadamia but maybe I'll use custard to
this a little later someone's gonna be
applying this with my morphe g16 I'm
gonna scoop a little bit up and then Pat
it underneath my eyes and I found that
by using more like a creamy concealer
underneath my eyes my eye fell priest as
much and notice my more like a liquid
underneath my eyes it can increase a
little bit quicker or easier
I don't know much seems weird that's
what it want what one I'm not blending
in the side of my nose I'm just blending
in the under eyes and then the liquid
that I applied everywhere else the sides
of my nose I'm going to keep that for
now I'm then grabbing my morphe m43 six
and I'm blending out the contour so it's
been so long since I've sat down to film
I know I was supposed to have a launch
today but that ended up being a ballon
until Wednesday I want to make sure
everything was perfect so I will be
getting that video up and explaining
everything and talking all about it next
week for sure
out of the way every weekend inside
it was crazy I went from Florida to LA
to Florida again and it will also be
getting my blog up I'm going to try and
get up this weekend although my weekend
is super hectic already and I was
traveling so much I didn't want to vlog
that way I can at least get that up for
you guys so I will keep you posted on
that as well tomorrow's will be going
for lunch where my sister is getting
married so I guess try out the food and
to see the place and everything like
that and then we have my best friend's
birthday dinner and Sunday we have a
christening so put me a little bit of a
hectic week in them and try my absolute
best and he has up for you guys so to
set my own eyes I'm trying to renew Kat
Von D locket translucent powder I
literally have not even opened it yet
I just ordered this one and then a few
other ones actually on Sephora I got the
little brightening powder as well but
this is the setting powder so this one
needs first so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to smooth out my creases with
this and then I'm going to use the Sigma
so3 brush you can really need either use
your V blender any brush just to apply
the powder I'm going to apply it pretty
heavy under my eyes and then I'm also
going to apply it up towards where that
darkness is I'm just going to blend out
smile line creases and go like this and
then whatever is like left on the brush
will just kind of like tap on my
forehead nagulu
so while my undereyes are baking I'm
going to go in with my sheet in my
palette by Kat Von D as well and I'm
going to go over all the contour areas
so with my Sigma e45 I'm grabbing a
little bit of the first and second shade
and I'm going to go right over the
contour that I have done I'm using my
Sigma f40 same colors and I'm going to
very lightly go over the contour as well
to set it and to bronze up a bit so I
purchase the powder I also picked up
this brush by it cosmetics it's called
five by fours powder and it's number
seven zero one for eyebrows I'm using my
Anasazi brow Wiz and the color evany I'm
just going to fill these in by the way I
have a t-shirt on there's a little Hello
Bay on it I know people are always like
this you make you know I never ever get
ready naked I'm putting in front of a
window
I want to scare the neighbors
since all my brows I'm using the brown
powder and ebony by anastasiya and I'm
using the brush number 12
also by outside yeah this is my favorite
where I'll brush because it's super thin
a lot of the other ones that I have are
a little bit thicker so it gets a little
bit messy sometimes this helps keep it
like super precise super neat and must
look like all you know you know what I
need to set my little brows I'm using
the clear brow gel so for I am using the
violet boss and Laura Lee palette I'm
using the color britches and I'm going
to be applying that in the crease of my
eye and using my Sigma e-40 brush
picking up the color buff with my f7d
and I'm picking up whiskers with the
same brush and we'll find that right
above it
don't worry about blending it at first I
just like getting the colors down and
then I'll work on blending them together
now if you're doing like dark eye shadow
like this and you want to prevent
fallout and you don't know ruin your
face makeup you just wet the brush I'm
just using my setting spray to dip it in
so I chose will be more pigmented and it
won't fall out all over your face and
then right above that I'm mixing fried
and britches and I'm applying it right
on the top and then I'm just going to go
back I'm just going to kind of blend all
the shades together blend them same
brush
the liner I'm using my Turkish liner
along with my e 10 sigma brush and I'm
going to go back in and go over the
color so this is just kind of like my
rough draft
now I'm going to go back over those
shadows I'm going to be a little bit of
the color Lu up it's a black shade and I
want to put that really close to the
eyeliner just to give it more of like
that faded look
I'm picking up a little bit of the color
fried and I'm putting that in my crease
so highlight under my brow I'm mixing
basic and sugar relaxes today I'm using
new Samantha lashes by Buddha Beauty
picking up a little bit of the color
smashley
and I'll apply that on my lower lash
line by the way I applied out with my M
170 - 4 and then when my pencil brush
I'm picking up the color fried and I'm
blending that into the green so you guys
can see like how much has changed I
didn't want be like - like forest green
I wanted it to be more like a
yellow-green
so going to blend that in and then
downwards
for mascara I'm using my buxom mascara
by the way big fan of the setting powder
so far so I'm going to use a little bit
more and I'm going to apply it
underneath my eyes to do my body mascara
I thought you guys this trick a few
videos ago but it really really really
helps so I'm going to do my bottom up
mascara now and I'm going to apply a
little bit of this NYX wonder pencil I
can get the plastic off I just opened it
you guys can do a black liner
I just want my eyes look smaller so
that's why I'm using unused so now that
I went the powder off I'm going to use
my Mariya Badescu facial spray with
cucumber and green tea and I'm going to
just set all the powder
I actually just recently found out that
Mario Badescu is cruelty free super
excited about it because I love their
rose water sprite I actually ran out of
it from awhile ago but when I found out
that they were cozy free I saw they had
a new flavor out so of course I had to
try it and it smells so yummy so I like
to use this spray just to kind of like
melt everything together and then I'll
use something else to set it at the end
so if you highlight my nose I'm going to
be using the new little cat by Nicole
Guerrero and anasazi of Beverly Hills
look how beautiful it is I love it so
I'm probably going to make I'm probably
going to make like these three I'm
thinking for a highlight today because
why not me and Brett went down to Tampa
to celebrate Nicole's birthday last
weekend and it was so much fun we had
such a good time as always so it was
cool to be there with her while the
launch happened and everything so the
first color I'm grabbing is Forever
Young and I want to smile
that brush is more feet a 35 by the way
little teeny teeny brush the highlight
on my keep itself and here I like it and
then I'm also going to have a little bit
in my eye tears up and then over that
I'm going to use the color kitty cat I'm
actually used to today because this one
actually looks like perfect ideas but
I'm going to add a little bit of kitty
cat over it
and then for blush I'm going to using my
BH nude palette and my Sigma s 92
so for lipliner I'm going to use by
Urban Decay the color naked - you have
to show up in it now for my shoulder and
I'm not chopping it you know what it's
like sharp that's what I'm dealing with
and then I'm going to use this hourglass
lipstick in the colour canvas it might
be a little too pink but Michel c2 pink
so I'm going to go in with color pop key
and a little bit of time Square over it
and set my face I'm using the Kat Von D
lock-it makeup setting mix this is my
first time trying this as well now
moving on to hair I'm gonna show you
guys what I've been doing all the time
the past couple of months as you guys
may or may not know I talked about at
lunchtime what I like to do is I like to
shower at night and then I let it air
dry a little bit and then I put it in a
braid and then by the time I wake up I
have like nice beachy waves listen a
party where I normally started I don't
have a cone on right now so so there
will work and I'm going to be using this
launch I know it looks really weird this
one is actually discontinued but
Valentin makes exacting one I'll just
grab pieces and you just wrap it around
and then I'll leave like that much out
of the end and I also don't like to put
this iron too high up because then it
will get too curly by the roots so I
just start about two inches down and
then once you feel the heat coming
through I like to touch it that's when
you know that it's done and then that's
what the curl looks like you can see
it's kind of like uneven it's not
perfectly wrapped around and it's going
to give you like a really cool natural
look and like what's good about this is
since my hair's already pretty much like
wavy especially underneath I don't have
to do every single piece of my hair so
for instance if I blew my hair out
straight I would have to section it off
and do piece by piece to make sure every
piece was curly so this is my kinda lazy
day carotene which just so happens to be
like my everyday hair routine what I am
getting ready for the front piece I like
to bring the iron behind and then wrap
it so that way it falls nicely
and then always pull whatever pieces
you'll be able to see and I'll make sure
those are called as well
sold you like this one Baptiste just
because I see looks a little frizzy and
it for this side so one side is done
we're going to go on to the other side
and then I'm going to spy it and you'll
see it's not going to say as curly as
this
so now that I finish I'm using my triple
sec three-in-one texture spray this
stuff is amazing it just gives you like
a lot of body it gives you texture
without it feeling sticky I like to surf
spray as well sometimes you can get a
little bit too crunchy so I mean the
summer time I love that but for now I'm
just going to use this and then I'm
going to shake it
this massive it's super super fluffy at
first it'll calm down for sure but I
just like it super fluffy to normally
all like kind of part to the side and
then like put this side behind my ear
kind of like that up with that
I didn't use any hairspray and I use
very little heat because like I said I
let my hair air dry so that's like key
so I'm going to go figure out what I
want to wear and I'll see you guys know
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
I miss you so much and too much time I
see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
