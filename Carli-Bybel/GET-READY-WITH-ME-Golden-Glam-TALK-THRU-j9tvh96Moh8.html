today's video I am going to do and get
ready with me I wasn't really sure what
I was going to do as far as makeup but I
just wanted to sit down and do a chit
chat kind of update you guys on what's
been going on I'm sorry I spend
literally forever since I posted a video
I think this is the longest I've ever
gone to like four years and no I'm not
happy about it so I do apologize but
thank you all for being so amazing and
so patient I wanted to do a full face
routine because it's been a really long
time so I wanted to show you guys some
updates some of the new products that
I'm using and all of that good stuff so
you guys want to get ready with me
please keep watching
let's get started for primer I'm gonna
use my pores no more as always by dr.
Brandt this one is just my favorite
before I started filming I wash my face
and I applied a moisturizer to the
Merion Badescu moisturizer um I had a
really big pimple here that I had to pop
this morning as well so don't mind the
redness but I will come
way up so I'm just applying this in a
downward motion all over my face I'm
actually really excited to apply my
makeup today because I've been done like
a full face makeup look probably since
well I did it for around the baby shower
last weekend but I didn't go lay it all
out I just it a little bit so I'm
excited to do like full face Oh
yesterday I actually shaved my face so
if you guys want to check out that
tutorial and go tutorial for that but
it's not raising excited because your
makeup looks so 2 million so nice the
day so you would think since I just
wanted 8 night 9 day vacation that I'd
have a nice tan um I feel like I didn't
really get tan I will be posting my blog
I was supposed to get that up yesterday
but there's just so much footage and I
want to make it better so I want to rush
it before I start talking forever I'm
never gonna be the time I'm going to use
the Make Up For Ever HD stick and 125
and then I'm going to also mix in a
little bit of 127 which is over yellow
tone so it makes me look a little bit
tanner
again I'm just going to add in like one
or two pumps whatever I have left of my
127 Ultra HD and I apologize if there's
an echo I don't have a mic I will get
Marla eventually my room will be filled
so there won't be an echo so I do
apologize I hope it's not too annoying
I don't even really notice the echo of
items because I'm so used to it so I
know a lot more telling me a big set so
I do apologize but I really wanted to
sit down and film today and I just hope
it's not too good
this foundation brush that I've been
using is literally changed my life I'm
not even kidding
I got any brushes before we even moved
but I kind of tried them yet because
they were all packed so I finally
unpacked on my bottom on vacation
actually going to try to delete before
vacation and it's amazing it literally
make sure your pension ones so perfect
so all you do is you just smooth it and
it just blends everything so nicely just
makes everything so much easier and
quicker so I feel like if you know how
to apply your foundation really good any
brush will do the job but if you're a
beginner or if you don't really want to
put as much effort in this is so easy
and simple but are there seeking of
Everglade hand and I'm just sliding it
I'm gonna ply a bit of the best damn
beading lit mask
my lips are super chapped so next I'm
going to come to my nose with my la girl
Pro conceal in the color toast so the
last time that I saw you guys it was
before my cruise we actually went on the
cruise ship that had all those problems
and I love you guys so on
a real curbing boat that went right into
a storm and they had a like turnaround
because the boat was like tipping over
and stuff yeah so that was the exact
boat that we went on and it was only a
couple days after they got back so it
was actually really funny because it was
Brett's first cruise and he was doing a
lot of like sports stuff so he wasn't
paying attention in the news so I was
just praying that he wasn't going to see
it so as soon as we get on the boat so
maybe did you hear about what happened
in this cruise ship last week and I told
an old story I bet I found out
beforehand I wouldn't have came because
people were freaking it out I mean if
you watch some of these videos on the
news people were literally like freaking
out and I can relate because the last
year that we went on it was like six
years ago but we went in December and we
hit a snow storm so on the way back the
boat was really really rocky we were
sitting at the restaurant one night and
my sister's chair went like flying back
and at the wall that's how Rocky was
stuff was breaking so that to me was one
of the scariest moments ever meeting
crews again for about six years so of
course the crews stubbing it back on the
link before I had all those issues but
luckily nobody was hurt and the crew she
got back and by the time we got on it it
was okay and there are a few things that
were broken and stuff like that but
overall it was okay I explained
everything in my blog so I want to talk
about the crews too much so much just to
be like bored by it but um
or catch yeah so I'm just using this
brush to blend out the lines okay so we
just got confirmation our couch is gonna
be delivered this weekend we were
supposed to be in Colorado this weekend
for a Nicole's 30th birthday but we had
people here last weekend doing our
floors and they didn't order enough
boxes there were 20 boxes short so they
have to come back this weekend to finish
if they didn't come this weekend they
won't be able to finish so it's just a
really really hectic weekend so we'll be
able to go out which I'm really upset
about since we're going to go all out
for today's look I'm gonna do a queen
contour as well and I haven't done this
in a while but I'm just gonna do it
because I think it always makes the
makeup look and hold a little bit nicer
so this routine I would definitely
recommend for a night out or a special
event something like that obviously not
a everyday look so I am using my Sigma
e55 brush and this time for contour and
I am just applying this on my cheeks and
around my face you can use any cream
contour this one's really crazy I just
like it to use this one when I have a
little bit of a tan because I like the
color of it but you can use the la girl
for this as well which is a cheaper
alternative and I use it all the time
but tonight I'm gonna use this because
it's what I've been using and carve out
the cheeks and then I'm also going to
pass along my jawline
so I'm going to be using my Mac 130
brush to blend out the cheeks very
lightly and I'm just kind of like
pushing and then pushing up so like
pushing in the product and then like
scooping up that way it's going to like
really cargo the boom so what were they
talking about before I got interrupted
with my couch
oh the crew is to blend out my forehead
and use the same brush as well one thing
I notice is when we got on the boat the
people that worked on there weren't as
friendly as they were from the last
cruises that we were on I feel like it's
really nice when you go when you're on a
vacation and the people that work there
it's like super super Pleasant they
always make the experience so much
better in my opinion when people are
nice it's just a nicer experience I mean
it's common sense
I don't know I'm assuming was because
they were all sugar nuts when the week
before so that was a little bit of a
damper I never one my family had
mentioned it a couple times how it
really wasn't as good as it had been in
the past so we probably only doing
another cruise probably grovyle maybe if
we do it again if we out of Florida so
we don't have those two those four days
that were really cold the first two days
you're at sea and we had hoped that the
second day would be a little
be able to layout but it was too cold
it's actually snowing one of the days
which was really it was actually really
cool to see um so who knows we'll see we
had a really great time with the whole
family of course papa was missed so much
but my grandma played his numbers when I
am roulette and want a lot of money so
that was really exciting so we know he
was there with us in spirit for
concealer I'm using this one bright tart
and it's in the color light medium I'm
just going to put a little bit on the
back of my hand should be almost all out
of this one I've been having some
technical difficulties while filming
this I have my screen right next to me
on like an iPad and it just looks so
dark so I keep getting up to make sure
that's not dark on the camera for
whatever reason usually discolor the
same with that and I don't have to film
this really long video and coloring me
right so hopefully we'll all look good
and then to blend all that and I'm using
a damp Beauty Blender damp not damn I
feel like I've been has been really
crazy trying to get out of the old house
we rented a u-haul truck
when was it I think it was last
Wednesday our Thursday we got onto our
cruise last Sunday and Nicole had a
meet-up in New Jersey so she came and
see with us she actually got there on
Sunday and I actually wasn't feeling
well
I started feeling what that was going to
get a cold so they were here Sunday
Monday and they left Tuesday morning and
I was sick Monday Tuesday and then I
believe Wednesday we did the u-haul but
I could be mistaken maybe was Thursday
it was actually really funny because I
drove evil down to Old Bridge and I wish
you guys could see it it was hilarious
we had some fun driving that thing but
we went and we got all of our stuff out
and let me tell you what a relief
because I hug your way into last minute
I just didn't know I couldn't envision
it and so I can envision it actually
being done so the fact that it's time
it's just bricks I am just go over my
nose contour a hundred times because to
me that's like the most important thing
to set my under eyes I am using a laura
mercier secret brightening powder this
one is a little bit more lightweight
than the actual more Mercier powder
which I love that one as well and then
the brush that I'm using to apply this
powder I've been using for a few weeks
as well as the artis elite oval six the
nose one is the O four and the big one
is the oval-8 so what I do is I just
pick up powder on the brush I take my
Beauty Blender smooth out the wrinkles
and then I just push in the powder and
this brushes makes it so much easier
because you just kind of like push and
then it's like the perfect shape and
just so you guys know I'm not sponsored
by them at all they did send me the
brushes to try them I was actually going
to purchase them and before I walk the
whole set I just I always like double
check my email because sometimes people
will email me and offer me to send me
the product and they actually did which
was cool I was like a few months prior
so I reached out and they actually send
me the whole kit to try I'm also going
to pick up a little bit and then apply
it right underneath discount one next
I'm grabbing this color by Illamasqua
it's heroin and my Sigma e45 and I'm
just seeking a tiny tiny bit it's like a
pointed tapered brush I'm thinking a
tiny bit and I'm going right over those
lines and that's just to set it again
just a little bit goes a long way
because if you make the lines too dark
it's gonna be a lot harder to blend them
and you'll see the lines a lot more next
I'm going to do brows I'm using my brow
is by Anasazi Beverly Hills I've been
using this a ton and it's already empty
crap won't even scroll up anymore so
maybe I can use this let me try I just
like to fill in first usually this is
like a nice pointy tip to shoot them and
then I'll go in with my brow where to go
but yeah
tweeze my eyebrows yesterday and I feel
like they're just not even well let's
see if I can fix that I'm using the
build Brown over 12 brush by dick
cosmetics in my favorite brow brush and
my brow bar to go in the darker shade
I'm picking up a little bit I'm so start
filling used so weird because in my mare
they'll even then I look on the screen
and they don't look even so well as good
is there any for now because I can't see
their glitter um I'm just wiping off
that extra powder under my eyes next I'm
taking this minutes and finish my Mac
it's in medium plus and I'm just going
to set all the areas that I was
concealing just because we don't want to
look shiny so I'm going to do under here
a little bit you'll see it'll instantly
mattify brighten
and my word I use do this brush
and then I'm just going to wait with
that fries I'm using my credit Bible
palette this one is all beat up feeling
I'm always using like the mob shades and
all that so I maybe some of the little
shades and kind of switch it up a little
bit I'm going to apply this matte like
nude shade all over my lids and I like
using on my color on the lips because it
really opens up your eyes and the shoes
are so pigmented I love this one's at
the perfect nude lid base then with my
Mac 224 I'm going to be picking up this
brown shimmer shade a little bit on the
brush and then start blending it into
the crease I get a similar look recently
and a lot more asked me for tutorials to
figure out
grabbing the school cheat right here I'm
going to apply that right on the top
part of my lid like right under the
crease not all the way down to the lid
just right here
this is so random but I just find it so
much easier for me my Kat Von D tattoo
liner is completely dried out and I
haven't gotten anyone yet so I wouldn't
recommend obviously doing this if you're
doing other people's makeup but since
it's my own makeup I'm just inking it on
myself what I've been doing is using the
tart tart East Clegg paint liner I take
a little bit out and I dip this into it
because I just love the shape of this
brush and it just makes eyeliner a
hundred times easier in my opinion for
lashes I'm using these double whispies
by our Dell just to whispies they sell
them like that now I don't remember
where I found these
I found them going to store somewhere
and I was like double whispies okay well
that's drying I'm just going to grab a
little bit of this gold
Tyler Shi with my pencil brush I'm going
to apply that on the lower lash line
partner grab that same brown color we
use in the crease and I want to drag it
from the outer to the middle
I'm having a smaller blending brush and
that same dark brown shimmer actually no
forget that I'm gonna grab a lip of this
matte dark brown and I'm going to apply
little bit on the outer part of these be
a little just to darken it a little bit
literally one little drop will go a long
way
I love these shadows if they're so
pigmented and then to highlight under my
brow I'm going to use a little bit of
this pink shade right here you can tell
this one's my beef turn to my favorite
part ever I'm gonna highlight my nose
I'm going to use that same pink shade
with my morphe 35o it's a little tiny
brush brush onto the lip brush and then
I'm just going to do a straight line I
always use this pink shade because it's
stolen or pigmented than any
highlighters that I have actually the
new Charlotte Tilbury that was in my
favorites video I tried to use up to
highlight my nose and I'm needed to put
my eye shadow over it to make it really
pop so little ball tip
for mascara I'm using my Lancome ran do
so using exit eyeliner by color popomon
outline my inner lower lashline for
bronzer i'm using my color pop it's
called Paradise Cove kind of light so
I'm just going to go in with my shade in
like Comper even though it's using that
middle shade
and then for blush I'm using let me use
this color this is from the new BH when
you blush kit I haven't tried yet I'm
going to mix this one and this one but I
got peachy look
I don't like this no just kidding
Deniz a little bit of that skinfinish go
over so it's not so pink
just because I just picked this one up
it's by Physicians Formula bad boy in
action so I took musicians formula late
I don't know two years ago and I didn't
love that high later so I saw this
beautiful blush so let's see if it
actually works
yeah it's just like sparkles they always
look so pretty but they don't have
pigment
I'm gonna swatch on hand just to say ya
know pink sparkles lips now what do I
want to do for Elise I'm going to strip
down because I always like to you strip
down I don't know what color lip I
should do I kind of want to do like a
peachy pink I'm ready for spring so I'm
going to mix because I want you to
little dip stick I don't want to bright
I'm going to mix retro coral and cure
Hollywood both by anastasiya bubbly put
like a tiny bit of this coral that in
first and then I'm going to go over it
pure Hollywood and then back I love the
strip down
I'm going to grab a little bit of that
same highlight color that I use for my
nose there the plan is not and I haven't
highlighted my cheeks in so long but I
feel like this look is like screaming
spring to me so I'm just applying
eyeliner why not
I'm going to mix that pink eyeshadow and
I'm going to be mixed with the gold
highlighter from the palette all right
so now that I'm done I'm going to use my
variable desk you what to do with the
hair you know what I'm going to just do
it um I'm just gonna straighten it
I work straight a couple nights on the
cruise and I haven't just worn my hair
like down in straighting so long so yeah
I'm some student a little bit so last
night a shower and I put my hair in a
braid so it air dried and has like some
leaves to it so stinking we did it just
we put some leaves but I feel like I've
done so many videos it was curly hair so
I'm just gonna blow it up so I'm just
using this round brush and I'm using the
hairdryer from the Nicole Guerrero
Bellamy kit it comes with come on a blow
dryer
all three of those are in my bathroom
hole I just brought this one out it's
amazing this hairdryer it has so much
power to it which is awesome so shout
out to Nicole for having the best hair
can on the market guys that I could
check it out so yeah I'm just going to
blow out my hair a little bit make it
straight so this is the second time it
happened when Nicole was he or she was
actionable during her hair same spot and
all of the plugs in my room stopped
working so I don't really know how I'm
gonna film this if the sockets don't
work I guess you guys don't really need
to see me bulge on my hair if you guys
want a blow-dried tutorial I can do that
but what I'm going to do is just go
through the entire hair with a round
brush and I just do pieces like this and
I just smooth it out so I'm going to go
off-camera and blow it out a little bit
and then I'll come back on to finish up
the video sorry about that so I did the
top the front and then a little
underneath I didn't fully love my hair
because I don't really ever do that but
I'm just going to go through the rest
with a straightener I'm using the
strainer that also comes in Nicole's
kick all I'm going to do since I don't
want it like pin pin pin straight is I'm
just going to grab little pieces and
just straighten it if you want like
super super pin straight hair I
definitely recommend um just clipping it
up and doing sections but again I don't
want it too flat because I hate that
flat hair
so I'm just going to do like the pieces
that look a little bit wavy when I get
to the bottom pieces of the hair I just
curl it under a little bit to blend nice
I got my bed and table top what happened
was I got a smaller size marble vanity
top and it was a little too small to go
with the mirror that I wanted to use as
my vanity mirror I'm actually using the
mirror from my old beauty room with you
guys so my old be room tour there's like
that white really pretty near so that's
what I'm using as my vanity mirror so I
originally wouldn't return the smaller
one and then just buy the bigger one but
it was on back water so while I was
waiting for the bigger when I still kept
the smaller one and when we were in LA
as soon as I got home from a leg of
course I had a whole towel over the top
because Lily was like you can't room in
the top where you won't be able to
return it so of course as soon as we get
home from LA I go and I look in the one
little tiny area that wasn't covered by
a towel there was a foundation that was
spilt over and ruined the marble so now
there's like a little stain on it so now
I'm not able to return it to it what I
figured I would do is just use it which
I'm using right now and it's honestly
awesome I'm using it as my filming desk
so I have my vanity over there and this
is like where I'm filming which is so
cool because I don't know if you guys
follow me on snapchat but I showed you
guys what I used to use to like balance
all my stuff on while I was filming I
used in my old makeup kit that I used
when I was doing freelance work and when
I tell you these surface area was PI
like that big so I had like my mirror on
there and then like makeup balancing and
absolutely
artists never so it actually all worked
out this is a perfect desk to use to
keep all my stuff on while I'm filming
so this definitely happens Burmese and I
posted a picture yesterday on Instagram
we were pulling off the wallpaper in my
closet from the old place because he
kind of didn't want it up and there were
three little rips and it's so weird
because the first trip I don't care what
anyone says like it's a penguin it
literally at the eye the exact spot go
check out my Instagram we want to go see
how weird it why the bag fell me and
Brett felt like the universe was
speaking to us because how does it
happen three random reps and then one of
them is a penguin and I'm wearing my
penguin t-shirt which II was also a
weird so who knows I think everything
happens for a reason and stuff like that
just doesn't happen so it looks like
California I don't we are not moving to
California or summer-like mobiles I mean
you're moving California no we just
bought a house in Jersey so we are not
moving anywhere our TV it's a sign up we
need to go to your trip out there it was
really weird because like the past week
I'm reading a lot of books and in one of
the books that I was reading is coffee
well it's different signs and like
changes whole life by just saying yes to
things anymore
Wasim no - so I was just like really
like thinking about all that kind of
stuff and just gotten relate to the book
and then we went over there and that but
I was just like okay I don't know I
believe in science
what about you guys do you believe in
that kind of stuff so we think that's
the straightest it's gonna get for now
I'm gonna pick out my outfit and then I
would show you guys what I decided to
wear so I just got a tweet from my Carli
bybel fan page you guys are the cutest
on Twitter her name is Carly with two
eyes sorry my oh my god is Miss Cheng
going and she could please say hi in
every video so hello beautiful thank you
for running that account on Twitter

posts always make my name mwah love you
I grew up in the kind of place you have
to pass when traveling somewhere else
my mother laughed more than she cried
but when she cried it was something
jin-yi I am baffled by the echoes I've
been deafened by the side
that place where they said we should
dream heaven keep our feet read so this
is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and you so much for
watching I'm going to have at least two
more videos up this week and then I'm
going back with the swing of things
