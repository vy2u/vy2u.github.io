those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and today I wanted to film
myself getting ready and I wanted to try
out one of the biggest trends for spring
and summer this year which is the
holographic trend so I am covered head
to toe and holographic products and I
absolutely love how it came out so if
you guys aren't already subscribed
please hit the subscribe button right
here and click the bell for post
notifications that way you guys can get
updates every time I post but if you
guys want to see how I got this look
right here then please keep watching
start out today's look I'm gonna be
priming my face with a blurring primer
and since the whole theme of this video
I'm gonna kill her I swear today so miss
Cindy loves my little Christmas lights
she got shaved for foundation I'm gonna
be mixing number 300 and 310 from fenty
but I got a look at Lulu's already now
so these were the only two colors that I
had out I don't know if this ever worked
for me or what was going on we're gonna
start over so I'm gonna use my trusty
Fiona styles and number five I just
found another bottle of this in my
foundation drawer which I didn't realize
that one or two and there's literally
gone so everywhere so I promised my new
mission is to find my new favorite
foundation blonde to contour my nose
with toast by la girl and I'm going to
conceal with creamy beige it's like a
little bit of like a pinky undertone
which I love it's good for dark circles
and I need like $5
I'm gonna play a little bit more right
next to the brown
to set my under eyes I'm using the Cameo
powder by Ben Nye
so next I'm just gonna fill in my brows
you guys have seen this a million times
so to contour I'm going to take this
palette from BH and go over the cream
contour before I blend and I'm just
going to blend out that powder now the
very light hand I'm going to spray a
little bit of setting spray so first I'm
gonna take this wet and wild
highlighting stick and I'm just going to
apply that right onto my lid blend that
in with my finger and then I'm gonna
take the Pat McGrath a strobe light I
shout out with my finger and I'm gonna
apply that right over that crazy then
with my pallet I'm gonna pick up these
two purpley mob shades first I'm gonna
grab the lighter one and very lightly
blend that into my crease
and then a little bit of the darker mob
and apply that as well so for this look
I wanted a holographic look to be like
blueish tint and also like hints of
purple so that's why I wanted to mix
these two it together on the lid and
then to highlight underneath my brow I'm
picking up this purpley holographic
highlighter from my palette and I'm
gonna apply these two shades right here
into my tear duct and then right over
that I'm going to apply a little bit of
this as well for my lower lash line I'm
applying the darker shade
or mascara I'm using my favorite one
which is the buxom lash mascara and the
reason I love this mascara
especially when I have eyelash
extensions it's because it is a
water-based mascara so it's not gonna
ruin your lash extensions I've seen a
couple people asking like why I put
mascara on them and the reason I do is
because when I do a more dramatic look
they don't look as good without mascara
so I'm just gonna apply a little bit of
powder under my eye and apply some one
bottom mascara another thing I love
about this mascara is it never runs the
other mascara is that I use always leave
like dark black spots like an hour after
I would apply my makeup I don't know why
so this is the only mascara that really
prevents that for me plus I get to my
bottom lashes really long as well spider
lashes just how I like it so I'm going
to wipe away that powder and since we're
going with a full holographic theme
today I'm gonna take this purpley color
from my palette and highlight my nose
and I'm gonna mix a little bit of this
so it's not like crazy like I want this
look to be wearable but also super
holographic and as you guys can see
already drenched my body in this
highlighter before I started as well
when I bronze up my face with this BH
palette
and blush we're gonna go in with my
favorite so the main thing that inspired
my holographic makeup look today are the
new buxom holographic full-on plumping
lip polish top coats there are eight new
shades that are launching today and I'm
super excited to show you guys them in
action when I was watching them on my
arm the other day I was like just dying
inside because as you guys maybe know
from my past couple of videos I have
been living for lip glosses and these
plumping shades are absolutely insane
and they go with the whole holographic
theme of today's video and the trend for
spring and summer of this year so you
can use these products alone or you can
apply it over your favorite lipstick or
lip liner even all eight shades are now
available today at Sephora so one of the
things that I love about this product is
the applicator it helps glide
effortlessly over your lips so you can
wear it alone to instantly illuminate
the lips or you can use it over your
favorite lip product to amplify and
customize the color via the
multi-dimensional finishes so because
it's not a typical lip gloss wand it's
not going to move around the lip product
so if you want to apply it over a
different product it's gonna sit right
on top really nicely and just add that
beautiful holographic look so these
buxom plumping top coats aren't infused
with smooth prismatic pearls so because
I've got it's in to make your lips look
more plump so let's try these bad boys
out I'm super excited so I have a bunch
of buxom lip products in front of me the
one that I was just kind of drawn to
first is the plump line lip liner in the
color ransom so one of the things I love
about their lip liners is it's such a
big lip liner so I feel like it's gonna
take years to even finish this product
which is amazing so I'm going to use
RACI reveal which is the matte lipstick
also by buxom
I'm getting like Barbie vibes right now
oh my gosh well though everyone who's
first I feel like I'm gonna use one of
these first I'm gonna go with the color
Mariah and I'm gonna apply that right
over it do you see that oh my god if you
apply it right on your Cupid's bow it's
gonna give you a beautiful beautiful
highlight and when you focus it right in
the center it's gonna help make your
lips up here larger as well so it has a
little bit of like a tingly feeling
which I like because that way you know
that it's working and this one is
absolutely gorgeous it matches my eye
makeup perfectly I feel like this is
gonna be hard to choose just one because
I have these two are really like
speaking to me as far as this eye makeup
look so this is lip option number one
again this was Mariah
so next I'm gonna pick up the plump line
lip liner in the color stealth and for
lipstick I'm gonna use the color i rebel
rose so with this color lip I'm gonna
try out the color Savannah has yellow
undertones do you see that
so I really love this one as well I feel
like this color with a nice tan and some
golden I shout out some like golden
highlighter all over your face would be
like amazing since we're going a little
crazy with the holographic trend I'm
gonna try out the color ultra violet
which is a matte purple lipstick I don't
know how I'm gonna feel about it but I
feel like I should just try it just
because why not
that's pretty mmm it's really pretty and
I'm gonna just use a little bit of lip
liner just because I feel like it always
completes the look
I'm gonna use the color femme fatale and
for this look I'm gonna try the color
iris which is a beautiful pinky bluish
purple you see that and I love this
applicator it's super super soft so you
can see how it really transforms the lip
color and it just adds so much dimension
and how much bigger tip my lips look
next I'm going in with the plump liner
in hush hush which is my kind of color
and we are going to try the color Salina
this one is I think one of my favorites
oh my god this one's amazing so this one
is a white with like a bluish purple
undertone I feel like that this one
looks really good with this makeup look
as well I think this one might be the
one I don't know is this the winner what
do you guys think I think it might be so
I have to try this blue one just because
I'm have like a whole blue vibe going so
I'm gonna try one more and then I'm
gonna decide which one I like the best
for the rest of the video I'm gonna do
another like new dish shade just because
I feel like with this eye makeup look I
don't know how like a red or anything
that would look so I'm gonna go in with
incognito and we are going to try the
color Jourdan excited to see how this
one looks on the lips
hmmm this is really pretty as well I
feel like this one that matches actually
like the best you know what I might just
keep this one on and add a little bit of
Selena yeah I feel like this one is the
one so which lip combo was your favorite
