those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and today I found myself
getting ready for a lunch date I'm about
to hit the road but if you guys want to
get ready with me and see how I got this
hair and makeup look right here then
please keep watching start off today's
look I'm using the Natasha de Nonna
magic primer for foundation I'm using
the la girl pro coverage in the color
fair I'm gonna blend that in with my
damp Beauty Blender
I tried out some new skincare products
last night and I lovely bumps on my
forehead so weird I hate that that when
you try out like more than one product
so you don't know what it's the one
doing this is they don't think this has
ever happened to me before
it doesn't look like pimples it looks
like it's bombs to contour my nose I'm
using the la girl Pro conceal in
beautiful bronze and for concealer I'm
using the light/medium shape tape with a
side of bear hair and I'm going to just
blend that in with my Beauty Blender
so today I'm going to lunch with my
grandma and I figured why not film
myself getting ready to do a little
chitchat and probably meeting her in
about an hour or so so I knew I had to
get ready anyway and yeah I'm going to
apply a little bit more on the sides to
the lend out the nose contour I think my
favorite part of makeup is the nose you
don't feel like a lot people don't spend
the time on it like I do but it's
because when you don't love your nose
and you know you can change it with
makeup it's like a necessity every time
to set my under eyes I'm gonna be mixing
these two shades from my shade and light
palette normally I use like a setting
powder but this way it's a little bit
quicker that I found it's gonna blend
out all the creases and then go in with
those powders
can get over my forehead with my small
tapered brush and the lightest shade in
the same shade and light palette I'm
going to go over the sides of my nose
next for brows I'm going to go in with
my ebony brows with my lavender facial
spray I'm just gonna just bring my face
I swear this is my favorite part
I'm gonna go in with my ebony brow
powder and I'm just gonna fill these
brows in a little bit more
so for today's look I'm gonna try out
the new a soft glam palette by Anasazi
of Beverly Hills
I literally just opened it it's so fresh
I haven't even touched it yet I have
been dying to use this so I can't wait
to try some of these colors first I'm
gonna go in with orange soda make sure
you blend up any creases on your eyes
I'm going to apply that right into the
crease
with my finger I'm going to pick up the
color rose pink will not apply that
right onto my lid at the outer half such
a pretty color I love this color
and then on the inner part I'm going to
pick up the color glistening and apply
that on the inner half
I'm just kind of mix them together
with my smaller blending brush and the
color Sienna I'm gonna apply with these
shadows a little bit goes a long way so
I'm just barely applying a little bit
right into the crease I'm gonna blend
that up into the orange soda and also in
all the way into my inner crease as well
did you guys get any snow we got so much
snow we got like eight inches so I'm
gonna attempt to leave my house today I
should be good I know the roads are fine
my driveway is just not paved yet so
like a winter wonderland out there I'm
going back in to the large wine and I'm
just gonna blend again there's no one
new product on this brush and then with
my morphe M 170 - 4 I'm gonna pick up a
little bit of the color Tamara you
pronounce it and we're gonna put it
under the brows and I'm also gonna apply
that same color right in - I'm gonna
actually use my finger a little bit more
pigmented right into my tear duct
I really love how this looks oh I think
that's it for the eyes on the top I'm
going to go in with the color dusty rose
and I'm gonna apply that on my lower
lash line now
and I'm gonna play a little eyeliner I'm
gonna just don't feel like me without
eyeliner honestly come here squeaky toy
hi oopsie hi I'm such a big girl one
years old in February 18th I'm using the
tortise pencil by Tarte settling for a
lunch date you know for lashes I'm using
the Christina WSP there's perfect like
daytime lash if you guys have smaller
eyes and you've tried these mean they're
a little bit too big I really recommend
the art doweled mi Demi to my demi
wispies they're very very similar but
they're made for like smaller eyes so
for instance my mom she always sees me
using these she went out and bought them
and they were just too much for her I
shape and her eye so I told her about
the demi wispies and I don't know why I
feel like I'm saying that we are demi
wispies and she they look so amazing on
her they look how these look on me so
just a little tip from mascara I'm using
the buxom lash mascara it's empty I need
it pick up a new one
so I'm going to use a little bit of this
white in my inner lash line for blush
I'm using this cream blush from the
Ashley Tisdale BH Cosmetics club in the
color rose a and I'm using my damp
Beauty Blender and I'm just gonna pick
up a little bit
and just dab it on
to highlight my nose I'm using the
amrezy highlighter from Anasazi Beverly
Hills I'm so excited to try this it's
like ridiculous
and I'm going to apply a little bit on
my cheeks
and then we're gonna go in with some
runs uh using the shade and light
palette the middle shade so just realize
I completely forgot bronzer the guy just
got here to plot my driveway hallelujah
for lips I'm using the Shoei lip liner
in Sienna and then for gloss I'm going
to be using the champagne dream Bellini
gloss by Becca so pretty
matches this eye makeup perfectly too
and I'm gonna add a little bit of this
powdered orange ito new blush by it's
heart
oh hi Grammy again how are you okay
nothing I'll be done and probably like
30 minutes and then I can head down to
her she's so cute she's doing really
good by the way she was in a bad
accident I think it was the end of
January um but she's doing good she's
doing physical therapy she wasn't good
for a couple of weeks it was honestly
scaring all of us but she's doing good
so thank you to everyone who asked about
her I don't know what to do with this
hair so I think I want to do a high pony
it's really annoying because I ran out
of hair ties so I only have like this
big big big one
um can we take a second from my
sweatshirt though shut up I got matching
the sweat pants to I'll show you guys
the flop in a minute
so I think I'm just gonna do like a high
tyranny today I just don't have it in me
all of me is what you're kind of matches
so I'm just using like a brush like this
to smooth it I always like my pony's to
be kind of messy so it doesn't need to
be perfect so when you get all the bumps
down yeah I have a driveway so normally
I would like flip my head upside down to
keep it super tight but I'm going to try
to do it like this just because I don't
want to not be in frame
grab like a hundred times I do one more
yes
till they keep like these little guys
out and I didn't even curl the back
I just braided my hair when I got to the
shower so I kind of just have like
natural waves so I'm just gonna leave it
honestly I like to bring like little
baby hairs out so I don't look like I'm
balding so I'm just gonna spare a little
bit and then I have my texture spray
it's the triple sec I'm just with spray
in the back because I like my ponytails
to be a super fluffy zhesan adds texture
and I almost want like a little more
orange in my lips so I'm gonna take the
color tipsy and I'm just gonna add a
little bit
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I am gonna go
hit the road pick up my grandma grab
some lunch and I don't really also have
fun for the rest of the day but I hope
