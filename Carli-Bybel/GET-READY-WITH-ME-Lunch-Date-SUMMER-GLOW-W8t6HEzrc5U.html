today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here i have
plans to go meet some my girlfriends
we're going out to get some lunch and
some drinks so I figured I will feel
myself getting ready today so for some
this may be a little bit too much makeup
for a lunch date but I felt like going
all out today so you guys can use this
left for a night out for lunch for
breakfast cookie I want to get ready
with me today and learn how to get this
super summery glowy look then please
keep watching start off today's look I
am using my Holy Grail product that I've
been obsessed with the past four or five
months this is the Vita Liberata body
blur the shade that I have is latte it
comes one shade lighter which is latte
light and it also comes one shade darker
which is called mocha and I have been
using this in basically every single
video for the past couple of months I
wanted to show you guys how I apply it
because I always always apply it before
I put on my makeup you want your face
makeup to match your body so it's key to
make your body the color that it's going
to be before you do your makeup so
that's why I always like to apply it at
least on my arms in my chest and then
once I figure out what I'm wearing I
will apply it on whatever parts are
showing I love this product because it
has aloe vera in it also shea butter so
it helps keep your skin really hydrated
I have very sensitive skin so it's taken
me a while to find a product that
doesn't leave my skin feeling itchy or
anything like that and I really love
this because when you apply it it covers
any cellulite or any imperfections and
it has a built-in highlighter in it
which gives you a beautiful reflective
glow what's also great about it is it
washes off at the end of the night and
it's the exact product that the Victoria
Secret Angels wore when they walk down
the runway so you know it's got to be
good and I do have a 25% discount code
for this product on Ulta comm so moving
on to the makeup I am using this rodeo
airbrush primer and I'm just patting it
all over my face for foundation I'm
using the Fionna Stiles foundation in
the color 5 so as you guys can see I'm
using a much darker foundation that way
I can make sure my face blends in with
my body so I am just dotting it all over
my face and then blending it in with a
damp Beauty Blender I always like to
blend my neck in with this type of brush
is one of the
our toothbrushes moving on to nose
contour i'm using the la girl beautiful
bronze and i'm just drawing down the
sides of my nose and one thing I've been
doing for the past couple of months
which works really well for me I'm using
the shape tape concealer I'm applying it
down the sides of my nose also a little
bit on my smile lines and on my forehead
and I like to use this liquid concealer
because it covers the nose contour much
better so I'm using the NARS matte
concealer underneath my eyes I like this
one under my eyes because it blends a
little bit better and I feel like it
doesn't crease as much as the shape tape
which I mean you could really just use
the shape teeth if you want but I just
found that this works a little bit
better for me so I'm grabbing this Tarte
brush and I'm just blending the
concealer in slow motions up the side of
my nose I don't want to wipe away the
brown I'm just patting the concealer
over it to cover it but to still keep it
there then I'm just grabbing a Beauty
Blender and I'm just blending that all
out with my Kat Von D setting powder I'm
applying this right under my eyes and
also right up against the dark parts of
my nose you can also apply this wherever
you applied concealer just to kind of
set the whole look for contour I am
using the shade and light palette by Kat
Von D and I am applying that on the
sides of my nose also on my cheeks on my
forehead and also along my jawline so
with this bronzer and contour it's going
to make my face match my body completely
so again this is another reason why it's
key to do the body bronzer at least on
your chest and your neck beforehand that
way you can make sure your makeup looks
good and you don't have any of that
flashback we don't want our faces
looking more white than our bodies for
brows I'm using the Anastasia brow Wiz
I'm using it in the color granite today
because I ran out of Ebony I'm just
waiting for my new order to come in but
this brow was is literally my favorite
brow pencil ever so I'm just filling
them in a bit and then I'm going in with
a brow powder to darken them up a little
more
so once your brows are looking good you
can wipe away the powder underneath your
eyes I like to blend it in circular
motions up against that dark contour on
my nose it lightens it up a bit so
moving on to eyes I am using my new
Carli bybel deluxe edition palette was a
large blending brush I'm mixing the
lighter brown and the darker orange
color and I'm blending that right into
my crease I knew I wanted to do like a
bright orange lip today so the eyes I
was just kind of winging it but I'm
taking a smaller more precise brush and
that same lighter brown matte shade and
I'm applying that on the outer third and
the inner third of my eye I'm then
picking up the new gold highlight shade
and I'm applying that right in the
center look at this color was only one
swipe of my brush it is so beautiful
it's like a perfect champagne E gold and
give it a little bit more of a gold hint
I'm going to pick up the second shade in
the last row that gold color and apply
that right over it and it's going to
really make this look pop make that
blend a little bit better into the matte
shadows I'm picking up a little bit of
that shimmer Brown and I'm just applying
that right on the edge of the gold then
I'm picking off the darker matte brown
shade and I'm just may accentuate the
outer crease a little bit and just give
it a little bit more depth so I'm going
back in with that orange shade and a
large brush and I'm just making sure
everything looks blended and nice
so next I'm just going to line my eyes
and apply my lashes I'm using the WSP
lashes by red cherry today I'm then
picking up the lighter matte brown shade
and I'm applying it on the outer third
and also the inner third just to mimic
what we did on the lid and I'm applying
the same two gold shades right in the
center and then to highlight in my tear
duct I'm going to start with the white
highlight shade to really brighten it up
and to really make my eyes look super
bright and then I'm taking a little bit
of the gold highlight color and I'm
applying that right over it just to give
it a little bit more of a gold undertone
laughs hmm
one is just one I'm going okay
um you should make memories uh I always
make that face whenever I sing and he
goes Zoo I can't help it I'm then taking
my Kat Von D foundation powder and I'm
applying a little bit on the darker
shadows on the sides of my nose and I'm
just dragging that up over the darkness
again and it's just going to kind of
calm down the nose contour a little bit
to highlight my nose we're going to go
in with that same a gold new highlight
shade from my palette and can we take a
second it's so pigmented and I just love
it so much okay so now that I got really
excited over the nose contour I'm going
to apply a little bit on my Cupid's bow
and I'm gonna wear highlighter on my
cheeks today guys so just a little bit
and just with a tiny little swipe this
is how pigmented it comes out which is
really nice and I'm applying it before I
apply my blush that way I can tone it
down just a little bit more because you
guys know I don't like too much
highlighter because I don't like when my
skin looks textured so for blush I'm
using this peachy blush from NYX and I'm
going to take a little more highlighter
and as you guys can see I don't even
need to do this because the body bronzer
gave me such a beautiful glow but if you
guys want to highlight a little bit
further you can apply that same gold
highlighter on any of the high points of
your chest
so for lips I wanted to do like a hot
orange color and I feel like in the
intro now it looks a little bit more red
but it is like a beautiful hot orange
color this one is by honest obvious
Beverly Hills I am obsessed I think it's
screams summertime and I feel like it's
been a really long time since I've done
a bright lip other than like a regular
red lip so again it does kind of look a
little bit red but in person it was like
that perfect hot orange color so I'm
just taking a little bit of this bite
lip mask and I'm applying that just so
my lips don't get too too dry
and Bay Beach I just came over
now for hair this little piece is cute
I'm just going to do it straight so you
guys have seen this so many times so I'm
just gonna snap my fingers and my hair
straight so I've just straightened my
hair you guys want I do have a full
in-depth tutorial on how I straighten my
hair I hope you guys enjoyed this look I
am going to put on the rest of my outfit
and then head out the door
so thank you guys so much for watching I
love you so much and it's the next time
I'll see you guys later
back someday
you'll never stop smiling I'm mega star
