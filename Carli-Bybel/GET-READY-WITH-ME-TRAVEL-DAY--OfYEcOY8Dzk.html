those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and I am actually leaving in
about an hour to head to the airport I'm
going on a very long vacation to Morocco
and I'm so excited about it so I figured
I would throw myself getting ready for
the airport today some of the times when
I do fly I learned no makeup but on some
days I want to got myself up a little
bit so this routine was super quick and
easy and I really loved how it came out
so if you guys want to see how I got
this look right here then please keep
watching to start ups today's look I'm
using the derma dr. dd cream and this
one adjusts to your skin tone which is
nice but beautiful everywhere actually
so I'm just gonna rub it in with my
hands and then I'm gonna go in with my
feet under I'm also gonna play on my
neck for concealer I'm using the
Charlotte Tilbury touch her in number
two this one's a nice lightweight
concealer as well just gonna apply this
wherever I get dark usually back
obviously if you want to wear less feel
free this is just what I have been doing
for today there are times when I do
travel with absolutely no makeup this
video wouldn't be too much fun if it was
just me washing my face and saying okay
I'm ready to go next up I'm taking the
Ben Nye Cameo powder and I'm just gonna
apply a little bit under my eyes to set
that concealer and to prevent any
creasing when it quickly fill in my
brows a little bit now I'm going to wipe
away the powder
and then taking my Natasha to donut
contour kit and this shade right here
and I'm gonna contour my nose a little
bit because you already know so now
moving on to eyes I actually just got in
the new Urban Decay Born to Run
collection which it's a whole travel
collection it came in this cute little
box and what better time to use it then
on my way to the airport so this is the
inside of the kit we have eyeshadow
palette three lipsticks three liners and
a setting spray I love the whole theme
of this collection so I'm gonna be using
the Born to Run
I showed up out today on my eyes I just
got my eyelashes done yesterday and I
had to do like more than usual because I
am going away for two and a half weeks
and I want them to stay so they look a
little crazy that's why so this is the
Born to Run palette it has pictures of
all different countries all over it
which is so cool I love this idea and
then when you open it up it has all of
these beautiful shades and it has this
mirror right here as well so I'm
definitely gonna be bringing this
palette with me on vacation there's so
many amazing colors in this and when I
first opened it I was like yes this is
like right up my alley with the Purple's
the oranges the peaches there's Browns
Shama Browns and then you also have some
greens which is nice as well so since I
am keeping it pretty light on the face
today I want to keep it somewhat light
on the eyes this peachy color is kind of
speaking to me it's gonna add like a
little bit of color to the eye but yet
it's still gonna keep it like pretty
neutral so I'm going to pick up still
shot and I'm gonna apply that all over
my lid
what I also love is how big this mirror
is I don't know if I already said that
but to travel it's always good to have a
mirror that you can like really use
because sometimes they don't have those
close-up mirrors where you're staying
which always just a little bit of a
problem for me at least and the lighting
in the bathroom is never amazing so I
could just bring this palette right in
front of a window and make sure
everything's looking nice it's just cool
I'm gonna grab a large bunny brush and
pick up the color riff and I'm going to
apply that right into my crease
with a smaller blending brush I'm going
to pick off the color good as gone it's
a little bit and apply that right into
the crease with the outer crease just to
give my eyes a little bit more dimension
I'm then hooking up the color blaze this
is really pretty because it has like a
peachy undertone which goes nice with
the eyes with the eyelids I should say
and I'm also going to apply this right
in the tear duct
so want to apply a little bit of
eyeliner this one is by flower then for
my lower lash line I'm going to pick up
the color ignite and I'm gonna do I
think
only lower mascara today because like I
said I do have a lot of top lashes going
on right now while my Laura mascara is
drying I'm going to apply a little bit
of bronzer / contour so that one was a
little too gray I think I'm gonna grab
this Milani baked bronzer it's gonna
give me a little bit more of like a warm
glow and a little bit of like a shimmer
which is nice perfect and now we're
going to wipe away the powder
I'm gonna go in with the Urban Decay all
nighter spray and this is like a mini er
version so it's perfect for travel and
I'm just gonna spray my face push all
the products together just looks really
natural
I'm just going back in with the color
breath and I'm just gonna play a tiny
bit more just a little bit just in the
crease to highlight my nose I'm actually
gonna use the same palette the color
breakaway we're gonna play a little bit
on my nose and also keep it well
and a little my tear ducts for blush I'm
using sweet pea by flower
for lipliner I am using the color free
spirit by NYX
this color matches the eyes perfectly
and to finish the look off I'm gonna go
back in with the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray I'm gonna bring this and
put this right in my purse because it's
so refreshing and I love bringing a
setting spray with me on the plane
because he gets super dehydrated so
definitely gonna throw this right into
my purse so finally was able to wash my
hair I love to travel with a braid so I
think what I'm gonna do is like a French
Dutch braid so I'm gonna just show you
guys how I usually do it I'll take like
a bigger section to start so I like to
split it into three like so I know it's
kind of hard to see because my hair
start we're gonna take this section put
it under the middle section and then
this section and put it under that
middle section and then pull it so now
it's all kind of in three sections still
we're gonna take this one again and put
it under and then tie it in and then
with this section we're gonna grab a
piece of hair make sure it's smooth
before you pull it tight
section of hair
to brush and smooth and that's gonna go
under that middle piece and if you guys
want I do have a full like Dutch braid
tutorial this is a little bit hard to
understand so we're gonna just doing the
same thing
I always bring it to the front
raid
and then I like to just pull the braid
bigger
and it'll get look super messy in a
little bit so I kind of like I don't to
make it too messy because it always
somehow it's a mess so this is the final
result I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'll show you my full outfit in a
minute I just got to go change finish
packing and then I have to hit the road
so I'm so excited I will be filming
