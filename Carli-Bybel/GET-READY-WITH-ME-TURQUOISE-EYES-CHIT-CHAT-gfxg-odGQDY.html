missed you so happy new year I hope you
guys all had an amazing holiday a great
New Year's Eve and I hope your new year
is off to a great start so excited to be
sitting down and filming for you guys
today I will be filling you in in this
video on what has been going on the past
couple of weeks where I've been and all
of that good stuff so this videos going
to be a complete talk through just a
chitchat video so if you guys want to
see how I got this makeup look right
here and then please keep watching I'm
using my Too Faced hangover primer I had
brought this with me when I traveled to
the Bahamas and I am assuming my eyelash
glue exploded all over the place but
it's fine I'm still going to use it so
for today's video I'm going to do a talk
through and just kind of update you guys
because I feel like this has been
literally the longest I've ever gone
without filming it's been super crazy on
my end so I just figured I'd fill you
guys in and do a full face look because
it's been a little bit so if you guys
don't like talked through videos and you
don't care what's been going on in my
life they want to skip to this part I'm
also going to take a tiny bit of this
mattifying primer and I'm just gonna
apply it where I get oily and I notice
my pores kind of come out throughout the
day I'm going to be showing you guys
like a full face routine like a full
glam highlight contour because you know
it's been a while so I'm just applying
it like on my nose right next to my nose
on my forehead on my chin and yeah
that's basically it
for foundation I'm using my favorite
craft Obion palette so the night before
we left for Bahamas I decided well I
decided like about a week before that I
wanted to try eyelash extensions I don't
know if you guys can tell I may look a
little
because basically I know eyelashes left
so I went the night before we were
leaving I went around like 3 or 4
o'clock and it took me about an hour to
get there
and I knew it was going to take about
like 2 hours but I also have like my
pedicure appointment and I had a path I
had a million other things that I had to
do of course I didn't end up liking how
it came out I asked her to just do
something like super super natural
because I wanted it to be like perfect
for the day time like when we were
laying by the beach and by the pool like
I didn't want to have to wear makeup I
just wanted to look like I had like a
little bit mascara on that actually
having to wear mascara so that was
really my goal I had seen how my mom's
came out and she loved it a little bit
more thick but I had told her like
showed her pictures I'm like this is
exactly what I want I want them super
wispy and really like natural looking
eye Beauty Blender thief's in this
household so hang on so when she
finished I looked in the mirror and I
was like oh no like of course I knew
like by saving it to the day before like
nothing ever goes smoothly for me it's
not that I'm the pickiest person ever
but since I do makeup and all that on my
only I know what looks good for my eye
shape and everything like that and they
were so dramatic that it looked like I
was about to go like to a wedding or
like to a prom or like something crazy
she was like I put like 5 on every
single lash and I feel like I didn't do
enough in my head I'm like oh my gosh
like I 5 on every lash like No
so I called my mom I had already at this
point missed my like nail at women which
whatever like that always happens to me
anyway I called my mom and I was like
really upset because I'm like what am I
supposed to do I was like looking up
different ways on how to remove them the
girl did it like I'm not gonna bash her
work she does amazing work on so many
other people but it was just not what I
was looking for so my mom was coming
over that night anyway because she was
gonna sleep over because Brett was me
drives to the airport in the morning she
came over it was like 9 o'clock and she
had texted her original eyelash girl
that she used to go to
was still at her work so we drove about
a half hour to go see her she removed
majority of the lashes and then kind of
fixed them for me and they ended up
looking so much better so I was so happy
about that the reason I'm telling you
all about this eyelash story there's a
reason I'm not just telling you for no
reason
because um I had my long nails on so as
I'm talking just gonna let you know
taking this lighter brown I mean it's a
darker brown whiter than that one and
I'm just gonna contour my cheeks and
here so they lasted the whole trip they
looked amazing I loved them I was so
excited I'm like yes I'm gonna start
doing this now just not having to do
anything when you wake up and you still
look like a girl like I feel like
without lashes I'm like a little boy but
with the lashes on I was like oh I
really like it I feel like so girly it
was just like really excited about it
so when I got home from the Bahamas um
one of my nails ended up breaking they
weren't like getting way too long and
kind of annoying anyway and I didn't
know what I wanted to do with them I
went to the salon and I had them just
take them up and cut them super super
short which they're already like too
long I got to cut them a little bit then
that same day I believe that I took my
nails off I went back to get my
eyelashes filled so I still have like
majority of them on but only like a few
had come off there was like no issues
whatsoever so I had to redo them all for
me they looked even better than they did
the first time and I guess because not I
guess because I took my nails off it's
like I have this very bad habit where I
sit and I pick on it mascara off so with
these eyelashes on it was like having a
scar on at all time so I've been having
a lot going on regardless so I feel like
whenever I'm really stressed out I tend
to pick them more but when I had my long
nails on I just didn't really pick them
as much because I guess I just I don't
know I just didn't do it so now that I
had my nails off and I have these lashes
on I just was so stressed that one night
I picked them all off and I have like a
bald spot in my lashes now so as I was
ripping the lash extensions off it was
pulling my actual lashes off with it so
yeah it was like a very weird scenario I
don't know it just
have it just like everyone has bad habit
that's my bad habit I've done it since I
was like in high school when I don't
have the lash extensions on I don't ever
actually pull out my eyelashes I just
pick off my mascara and like sometimes
the lash will come out but like never
anything as serious as this so now I
have like no lashes left I looked like a
thumb for like a week and a half and I
was like crying I'm like why did they do
this to myself
I look so scary my lashes aren't gonna
go back but they are starting to go back
obviously but I'm like sad because I
really liked how they looked but it just
wasn't working with my bed habit so it's
either I work on my bed habit and try it
again get my nails back on try it again
or I just don't do lash extension but
yeah so that was one of the reasons I
wasn't filming I mean there's a million
other reasons but like on top of that I
just felt like so like disappointed in
myself I just didn't feel like myself
every time I looked in the mirror I was
like oh my god like all I saw was like
this bald spot on my eye I don't know it
was just like kind of a traumatic moment
for me I know it's like
firstworldproblems it's nothing that
serious but that was my first story that
I wanted to share wheezing beautiful
bronze to contour the nose when I got
home from the Bahamas we got home on
what day was it it was a Tuesday I think
it was the 13th because it answered in
my mom's birthday and a slip all day on
the 14th because whenever I fly just
like don't feel like myself I'm just
always so tired and I just needed like a
date up just like rest and then you guys
had seen that week basically because I
had blogged it so you guys knew I was
like sick for a couple of days just not
really doing anything and then I had our
holiday party with Brett's family so I
had to prepare for all of that there was
like 20-something people coming over so
it was it was the first time that we
were hosting like any holiday or
anything at our house to the 18th of the
party and then the following week was
like the week of Christmas and also
Hanukkah so for Christmas Eve we went
over to my mom's house it was a fun
night it was me Brad my sister and her
boyfriend and we played Scrabble
we had some dinner we looked at old
pictures and all kinds of stuff like
that and it was just like a
fun relaxing that we played with the
kiddies my mom has two cats as well for
Christmas day we went first to Brett's
brother's house for breakfast then we
went to Brett's aunt for a party and
then we went to Brett's dad's house on
the way home so we were all over the
place on Christmas as well but it was a
really like overall amazing weekend it
was nice spending time with the family
everything like that days before
Christmas so Christmas was I'm just
trying to like remember my life so 18th
was the party I ended up getting sick on
like the 20th which was like a Tuesday
and I woke up and like my throat was
killing me I was definitely a cold it
was nothing crazy but like I had a
pounding headache
I was really stuffy and my throat was
killing me like every time I swallowed
so I was like in bed and just kind of
relaxing that like for a couple of days
on Christmas Eve I showed up at my mom's
literally zero makeup and I had like my
robe and I brought slippers like that's
how much I was like sorry mom my god I
love you but I'm not like a hot mess
today obviously she doesn't care so I
was still kind of stick out Christmas
Eve my Christmas Day I was definitely
feeling a lot better we were out all day
and I was fine I took some medicine and
I was feeling okay and then by Monday
I felt fine I was like okay good I'm all
better and then two days after I was
like all better I wake up again and I
couldn't even swallow
I thought it was so bad so I never I
usually don't even ever get sick but the
fact that I had like too cold within the
matter of a week it was like are you
freaking kidding me I got you know I
wanted to do a New Year's Eve look for
you guys I wanted to do another holiday
look for you guys but I just felt so
sick I had a New Year's party you
planned at my house for with over 30
people we had planned this months and
months ago so I knew that was coming up
and I
so had my family's Hanukkah celebration
on the 30th which was that Friday so the
midst of me being sick twice and knowing
how much chaos I had the following
weekend I then also had to help my
soon-to-be brother-in-law proposed to my
sister so my sister got engaged on
Friday the 30th and he had asked me to
come meet him I met him on like Tuesday
to help him pick out a ring and
everything like that and he was going to
originally wait to propose but like my
sister was just so like getting so
suspicious and everything that we were
like are you like you got to do it soon
because we don't want her to know we
want her to be surprised it's very hard
to surprise that one so I'm like seeing
Bears hair all over me Tuesday I want to
meet him Wednesday I got sick again
Thursday I was like in bed sick again
Friday was when he proposed so I had to
wake up super early and I met them in
Asbury Park where they had their first
date and I like hid behind a fence and I
film the whole thing and it was such a
beautiful moment it was honestly so
special and so nice and I was so happy
that he asked me to be a part of it that
was on Friday morning and then Friday
around 4 o'clock I had my whole family
over to exchange presents and everything
like that so that was hard I had to get
so much food mind you and I had to do
all this shopping everything because I
had Friday and then Saturday two parties
back to back which don't ask why I did
that to myself but I did and it was so
stressful decorated my whole entire
basement it looked awesome and I don't
even know if I got any footage because
it was just like chaos decorating you're
up all night didn't sleep at all Friday
night Saturday woke up super super early
if they're getting like 2 3 hours of
sleep went to party there again finish
decorating and
I had to get ready for the party and
then everyone started showing up on time
at like 8:00 and that was
whatever like is excess on the sponge
I'm just kind of setting like in between
wherever I like highlighted but all this
powder I want to keep on wall I do my
brows and then I'm gonna wipe it off and
we have a little Tiki doodle
she come to say hi my Peabody oh my god
so for the New Year's party we had
started off like very small we had like
35 people here which is crazy
um but it was so much fun we had rented
a photo booth which I think was like the
hit of the party in my opinion the whole
night ooh can you guys see this
what is so I just filled in my eyebrows
and I wasn't talking during them luckily
but I just raised my camera turned off I
just got a brand new cameras my first
time that I'm using it so luckily I got
up to just make sure it was still
recording because normally I have my
little iPod here iPad here which you can
see has the screen already on it um for
whatever reason this new camera is newer
obviously so the equipment doesn't work
as well and I can't see when it's
stopped recording on here so all you
missed was me filling in my brows I use
the Anastasia brow pencil on evany the
brow Wiz and then I used the powder in
Ebony as well to fill them in next I'm
just going to go in with my Kat Von D
kit I'm just going to go over that cream
contour the very light hand I didn't
want to do my normal you know beige is
Browns all of that which I probably will
use a little bit of brown but I got a
new watch which is just way too bare I
get the link seeking out yet and this
pretty little necklace I got from Etsy
I'm upset with Etsy shout out to all the
small business owners trying to make it
for themselves I love supporting people
that are starting their own businesses
so I've been shopping so much on Etsy I
found this necklace on Etsy
after I purchased this watch from
Michael Kors which I love so I am going
to try and find a color scent
of this and I am going to put it all
over my eyelid so me a minute I found a
zoo Oh see see there hundreds of vegan
and cruelty-free which is awesome I love
OCC so I have them in the color
saturation chlorophyll and I'm going to
mix them I'm going to use mostly
saturate but I'm going to add a little
bit of this like turquoise e green in as
well because I really wanted to pop on
such a gloomy day why not brighten it up
with some bright eyeshadow so let's see
how this looks
so first I'm actually going to grab my
palette and a large blending brush and
I'm gonna take the my shade like these
two I'm just gonna blend that like into
my crease so I'm really upset I didn't
get like any selfies or like pictures of
my makeup from my 1920s New Year's party
I also had like literally no time to
even do my hair I really wanted to do
like a big way like finger wave type of
hair didn't come out as plan but if you
guys want me to do like a tutorial
I know 1920s maybe people have them like
all throughout the year I know it's
mostly maybe like for like a Christmas
or a New Year's Eve party but if you
guys want to see like a look I created
and maybe like a hairstyle and stuff
like that let me know and I can totally
recreate that for you guys I'm going to
do saturate and I'm going to I like to
put it in the cap and I'm just going to
wet the brush a bit I use the side of my
Starbucks drink
why not whatever works and I'm going to
apply that all over my lids
so I hope all of you guys had an amazing
Christmas Hanukkah Kwanzaa whenever you
guys celebrate and I hope you guys also
had so much fun on Year's Eve I always
loved new years and years you because
it's like you get a chance to not start
over but like stuff you didn't get to
accomplish the year before just a chance
to do things that you weren't able to do
the previous year so I've seen some
people saying like have you give it up
on YouTube and I know this year was a
little rough for me I didn't maybe do as
much as I should but there's a lot of
stuff going on that I keep private
obviously I have so much going on in my
day to day life that you guys don't get
to see and I don't really talk about
because I like to talk about like happy
things and other things and all that
stuff so just know that it was never
that I didn't want to be on YouTube it's
just been a very hard year for me I've
been going through a lot personally it
was funny because the other day I was
putting away clothes and for some reason
I haven't worn it in years but I found
the shirt that I wore in my first ever
YouTube video and like first ever video
sitting on my floor in my mom's room and
I was like you know what I'm gonna go
back to my mom's house maybe film a
video right where I started and like do
something like that because just you got
to always remember where you came from
and how it all began and it's just so
crazy to think about like through the
years what YouTube and what all of you
guys have provided for me so she wanted
to thank you I know I don't thank you
enough and speaking of not thanking you
enough I have a huge holiday giveaway
that I never was able to announce does
that mean it's not happening heck no it
just means you know what now I'm gonna
add some more prizes into it I'm
thinking about I like doing there like
an iPad or a laptop or just something
really like big and special I hit five
I don't remember when was it was either
like October November and so I wanted to
do a giveaway for that and I wanted to
do a giveaway for the holiday so I'm
just gonna make a huge giveaway I'm
gonna announce it soon and yeah so let
me know if there's any like big presents
and stuff you guys want included I
really love this I'm gonna take a little
bit more of the mob and I'm gonna take a
drop of the dark brown for my palette
and I'm just gonna blend it right on
like that lines just so it blends nicely
into the crease and it doesn't just look
like you know I just placed plopped and
placed shadow wherever so just very very
lightly blending so I don't know if I
said this already but this is the first
time I'm using this new camera which I
knew I did say that but it's 4k video
do I look extra sharp so I'm just hoping
like I didn't have to put it into 4k
mode or anything like that because I
just kind of hit record and hoping for
the bag I am grabbing my eyeliner the
only one that I ever use I need to
branch out what eyeliner is you guys
like tell me because I want to try some
new stuff but um I really love this one
I do have to say though in the inner
corners it always smudges so it's
something that's kind of annoying but I
really love how black it comes out so
that's why I've been using it a ton my
rings back on because I'm not doing my
face anymore
my birthstone is opal and I'm obsessed
with opals as of lately so you know I
treated myself to the thrinng a couple
weeks ago okay back to the eyes i'm
using this liner and i'm just going to
line them as i normally would so i'm
going to tie and you pair lashes today i
never use these before they're the
glamorous lashes from socialised
cool and i'm going to glue these bad
boys on
I'm going to use the second shadow in
the second row from my palette I'm also
mixing the third highlight shade with
that goal to give it a little bit more
like a bronzed gold so it's not so gold
and the second shade in the first row
which is like that pink shade I'm just
going to apply like right in my tear
duct just to bring it up a bit and with
a pencil brush I'm going to take the
dark brown matte and then mascara you
guys see me do this too many times so
sort of bronze up my face I'm using my
Kat Von D palette as always Ranjan up
the cheeks forehead and all the usual
spots should I think if there was
anything else that I wanted to fill you
guys in on I did vlog last week a little
bit I also wanted to show you guys the
proposal and everything so um I think
I'll get that vog up this week as well I
don't know how much footage I actually
have so maybe a couple more days this
week and then I can um kind of combine
it all together highlight my nose I want
to use this color from my palette the
second highlight shade
I'm also going to apply that under my
brows extra lip liner I'm going to use
BFF there's like nothing left and this
thing's like falling out but I really
like it no I think we're on our last
days folks this is how desperate I am
right now
and then stick with like that mob color
which I have on my eyes and on my lips
I'm using a little bit of birthday suit
by color pop as well Eklund then to
finish off my look I'm using my lavender
setting spray and there's nothing on
this brush but I'm just going to kind of
blend a little bit just to make sure
there's no sharp lines or anything you
could use like a powder or something but
like I'll do that sometimes but I feel
like it's not as harsh as it can
sometimes be so clean brush will work so
this is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this makeup look definitely let
me know what you guys want to see this
week I am planning on getting up at
least three videos because I owe it to
you guys so I love you so much and make
sure to let me know what else you guys
want included for my big holiday slash
5-million giveaway I love you guys so
much and until next time I'll see you
guys later
