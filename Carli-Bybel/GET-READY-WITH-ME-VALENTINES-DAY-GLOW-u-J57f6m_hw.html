those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly today I film myself getting
ready and I created a really fresh glowy
Valentine's Day look for you guys
whether you have plans to go out or if
you're just staying in and you want to
glam yourself up I think this look is
perfect I also wanted to let you guys
know for those of you that don't follow
me on Instagram Twitter or snapchat that
I have a new filming schedule so every
Wednesday and Sunday I will be uploading
a new video for you guys at 10 a.m.
Eastern time so make sure to check back
on my channel on those set days for a
brand new video I hope you guys have an
amazing night tonight and if you guys
want to learn how I got this look right
here then please keep watching to prime
my face I'm using the cover effects
blurring primer these nails are coming
off tomorrow by the way I've had them
like a week and a half and I can't do
anything I can't type I can't do
anything so they're really annoying for
foundation I'm using the Fionna styles
luminous foundation in number 5 I did
apply a little bit of like a body
bronzer so I want to match my face with
my body but today's look I want to keep
it really like luminous and glowy I have
an idea of what I want to do but since
it is Valentine's Day I wanted to keep
it like fresh and glowy that's the plan
for today
I'm gonna blend my neck in with a
regular foundation brush is just easier
quicker for contour on my face I'm going
to be using the Charlotte Tilbury
contour wand I use this once I like the
color a lot it's just to be careful
because there's like an on and off
switch and I kind of put way too much on
the first time so you just got a very
lightly squeeze it I like pushed really
hard and there was like probably half
the bottle on my face I'm probably not
gonna use this on my nose because I have
like one shade that I always always like
to use which is from my graftobian worm
number three it's the high def glamour
cream palette you can see the one color
that I use is basically empty it's just
darkest shade right here with my morphe
m4 36 I'm just gonna the very light hand
blend that out
for concealer I'm going to use the shape
tape in the color medium and then once
that's all blended out I'm just going to
apply a little bit more just right up
against the two lines on my nose
for brows I'm using my one and only Holy
Grail brow is I have granite and ebony I
go back and forth but I'm going to use
the ebony just to shake them out
so I've been like growing my brows out a
little bit because they were just so
uneven naturally for a while and I feel
like they're starting to like be much
more even which I'm happy about to fill
in my brows with powder I'm using the
number 12 brush also by Anastacio this
is my favorite brow brush ever it's like
the perfect thickness and I'm going to
mix the granite and ebony brow powders I
like to start here and then I'll like
slowly work my way to the front that way
I like it when it kind of phase a little
bit when they're not like so so so dark
in the middle because I feel like it
looks more natural that way
so I always start here and then when
there's like nothing left on my brush
I'll like drag it in and here obviously
since my hair grows up I'm doing upward
strokes I'm just gonna do like circular
motions to blend out the powder actually
know before I do that I'm gonna go in
with my shade and light and my taper and
a blending 45 by Sigma I'm gonna take
the grace shade and I'm just gonna go
over those lines and the reason I like
to do this before the powder is the
powder will diffuse the color of this
powder a little bit so it's not so harsh
so yeah now we're gonna blend it all out
I'm just kind of like very lightly going
over the whole face that way it kind of
sets it it doesn't make it like too
powdery so now that I wiped away the
powder I'm just gonna use a little bit
of the setting spray
it's the aloe chamomile and lavender my
Mary a Badescu so when I was thinking
about Valentine's Day look I was drawn
to the purples and I recently just
picked up this violet Voss palette from
Sephora and this bottom row was like
speaking to me so I also picked up this
duo chrome top coat by Natasha de Nonna
the brown mob / purple so I'm gonna try
this first I don't know if I'm gonna
even use any shadow because I kind of
wanted to keep it like glossy and like
really fresh looking so I'm gonna try
this guy out and then I'll see if I need
any other shadow with it so I'm just
using this as a concealer brush I always
use it as an eyeshadow brush it's the F
70 and I'm gonna apply this on my lids
it is so pretty I love Natasha tanana's
products so pretty it's like super
subtle but it gives you like a glossy
finish so like part of me wants to just
leave it like this let me see what we
have in this palette that I can maybe
you know what I might take a little bit
of the color sunset it's like a really
pretty light purple and I might just add
a little bit into my crease I'm gonna
start out with like a tiny bit and just
see how it looks it might add
and I just barely touch the shadow and I
wiped it off a little bit because I want
to keep it light and then I want to
blend it up towards my brow that way it
feeds really nicely yeah so it just adds
a little bit of dimension but it's still
gonna keep that glassy look so honestly
I think that's all I'm gonna do for the
eyes because I just really really love
how simple it is so do you guys have any
plans tonight for Valentine's Day
comment below let me know what you guys
are doing even if you're just staying in
why not blame yourself up get some
pictures why not I'm gonna play a little
bit more of this and the tear duct come
on just bathe myself in this honest and
chic highlight under my brow I'm gonna
grab my palette they officially stopped
making my palette so once it's sold out
it's gone forever but we kept it around
a lot longer than anticipated so I just
wanted to first say thank you to
everybody who purchased it everyone who
has been loving it and cretan looks with
it you guys are amazing I'm so proud of
this palette you haven't gotten your
hands on it yet
I would pick one up or if you do love it
I would grab an extra or two because
it's gonna be going forever soon so I'm
gonna probably let's see yeah I'm gonna
grab a little bit of this highlight
shade it has a little bit of like that
purple undertone I'm gonna highlight
right under my brow and I barely touched
it
and I'm gonna also apply a little bit of
that and underneath my eyes I'm gonna
apply a little bit of the color sunset
as well this one is by Too Faced it's
the black liquid art eyeliner I have to
go get my eyelashes I have like eyelash
extensions I'm going to get them done
tomorrow so they're like a little bit
sparse so if they were done today which
they're not I would just probably add a
little bit of mascara and call it a day
but they're pretty thin on the edges so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my
favorite
WSP lashes by Christina I'm gonna cut
them and just apply on the outer house
just to give it a really like sultry
look so I'm gonna cut these I've used
these before I'll probably cut off like
one to three of the two of them and I
cut off two and I'm gonna attempt to put
these on these nails are honestly so
difficult I know once you keep them on
you get used to it but I think I'm
allergic to the gel because my cuticles
get so bad whenever I have these so I'm
gonna go back to my tiny little nugget
nails I prefer them it's just easier so
now I'm just gonna apply a little bit of
mascara this is the buxom mascara which
is one of my favorites I'm gonna apply a
little bit of powder under my eye and
I'm gonna do some bottom mascara
I'm gonna grab this nude eyeliner it's
called honey dude and I'm gonna align my
inner lashline this is gonna make your
eyes just appear a little bit more open
and more youthful
my opinion um taking a little bit of my
Kat Von D foundation powder and I'm just
gonna apply a little bit on the sides
like over my nose contour mom lying a
mascara dry I'm gonna highlight my nose
I kind of want to use the purple that I
used like under my brows but I don't
know how it's gonna look maybe I'll use
that and then like a different color
over I let's see I'm gonna use a little
bit of this pink shadow over it because
I mean I like how it looks but
realistically most people are gonna want
like a purpley highlight so I'm gonna
use a little bit that pink right over it
a little bit of both threw it on Cupid
oh so now I'm gonna wipe away the powder
under my eyes and I'm dying to try out
these I bought these two diamond and
glow palettes I'm probably going to use
this one which is Daria yeah cuz it has
more of like the pinkish purple Lee
tones where's my Beauty Blender I'm
gonna grab a little bit of the cream
blush which is this middle pink shade
I'm gonna just dab it onto my cheeks
I'm gonna do the blush before I add any
bronzer just because if it's too much
I'm gonna have to probably tone it down
a little bit I'm going to this duo glow
is just too amazing I need to try it I'm
gonna apply it with a Beauty Blender as
well I'm gonna just dab a little bit to
start cuz I don't want to go like crazy
overboard I'm just gonna apply that
and this is so beautiful I'm gonna maybe
grab a little bit of this diamond powder
because just look at it it's amazing so
I'm gonna use a tiny bit barely touch it
and go right over that so for lips this
might be a trial and error so I might
not like it but we're going to try I'm
gonna try the Shoei Sienna lipliner I'm
gonna over line my lips don't winding
them and just cleaning them in a little
bit I'm stuck between Times Square and
love love muffin I gotta use love muffin
it's Valentine's Day look I'm gonna use
a little bit cuz it's very pink but it's
like a satin lip which I like and I'm
gonna try a gloss which you guys if
you've been following me forever you
know I just never use glosses but this
becca gloss matches as I shut out too
perfectly so I'm gonna use like that
much of love muffin my lips are so
chapped
chapstick I don't think oh I do have
little traps that great wave I have this
bite agave lip mass so I'm just gonna
apply a little bit cuz my lips are like
nasty which kind of makes them look
glossy anyway but um
see yeah a little bit of love muffin
maybe like a drop more and then I hope
this doesn't ruin it I'm gonna apply a
little bit of this becca crystal lip
topper and the color amethyst oh wow
I literally used like the tiniest bit
and I think that's all I need is a tiny
more
so I didn't even put any bronzer I'm
gonna use a tiny bit just because my
face looks a little bit lighter than my
body at this point but I'm gonna apply a
little bit like on my forehead just the
middle shade from my shading like
palette and a little here
gosh I'm obsessed and I really like the
glossy lips it just all ties it together
so beautifully
I am 1000% wearing my makeup like this
for dinner
on Valentine's Day or tonight cuz you're
seeing this video on Valentine's Day
how should I wear my hair so I was torn
between like a ponytail or just wearing
it down I know for me I'm most likely
gonna be wearing it down so I'm gonna
curl it cuz if I were to do like that
big messy ponytail I would curl it
anyway so I'm just gonna section off my
hair I always like to just bring all my
hair to the front make sure it's rushed
which I guess that's one good thing
about these nails they double as a brush
and I'm just gonna grab random pieces
and start curling I like my waves to be
like pretty big so like I just grab
random pieces and just start curling I
like to leave like this much at the end
because they'll look more like waves as
opposed to curls so I'm just gonna
repeat the same thing throughout my hair
and when I repeat the same thing on the
other side and by the way I'm using a
Bellamy one-inch curling wand to create
this look so honestly I'm just gonna
part it down the center put all the hair
I did to the back and I'm just gonna
instead of doing another section I'm
just gonna start grabbing so I wanted to
thank you guys for all your beautiful
comments on my sister's wedding video
I'm so happy you guys enjoyed it and got
to see a little preview of the best day
of both of their lives it was so amazing
and I swear with all the planning the
night goes so quick so if you guys are
getting married soon or you're in the
middle of planning and it seems like
it's so stressful just know that the day
of it'll be so worth it and just got to
live in the moment and take it all in
because the night flies by and you're
gonna remember that day for the rest of
your life so I'm grabbing the front
piece of my hair I'm bringing my iron
around and I'm curling it back away from
my face and usually when I do my hair I
like to pin up just the front pieces
because these are the ones that always
follow the quickest so I'm gonna leave
it like that and we do the same thing
with the other side
so again I'm gonna grab the front piece
I'm gonna curl it away from my face so
if your hair doesn't last that one when
you curl it you can pin all the curls
and either like do your hair first pin
it and then do your makeup but my hair
kind of stays and I always like to just
do the curls a little bit a little bit
smaller that way when they do fall
they're like perfect but I always just
like to like shake it out a little bit I
like to do it in the center and then
I'll just kind of like work with it I'm
gonna like do like a side part or
something
I don't think I'm
but I think I like it down little-ass
think
so I picked out my outfit I'm gonna just
apply these earrings one of my good
friends got these for me as a late
birthday gift they're really pretty I
love them that rose gold studs I don't
know any rose gold studs when I open
these I was like I can't wait to wear
them you're so pretty there from
Francesca's
so I'm already I'm definitely gonna be
wearing this with probably like a jacket
I don't know what type of jacket over it
obviously because it's freezing but I
hope you guys have an amazing
Valentine's Day whatever you guys end up
doing make sure to be safe and have so
much fun thank you for watching I hope
you enjoyed getting ready with me today
remember to check back on my channel
every Wednesday and Sunday for a new
upload I love you guys so much and until
next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
