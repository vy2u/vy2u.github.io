my second appointment for micro bleeding
so I talked about it a little bit in I
guess it was my get ready with me video
why is there a bus it is 11:30 8 p.m.
and there's a bus right in front of me
so I'm going to be stuck behind it but
anyway I mentioned how I had gotten my
eyebrows micro bladed probably I guess
like five weeks ago and I knew I had to
go back for a second appointment so I
asked you guys if you wanted for me to
bring the vlog camera and bring it what
is going on here when you're running
late still many get coffee and there's
30 kids coming off this bus all but
they're students so I asked if you guys
wanted to come with me for my second
appointment and you guys seemed to want
to see how it's done so I really didn't
know much about micro bleeding
whatsoever I get my hair done from one
of my friends and her name is Felicity
I've mentioned her a billion times we
were somehow talking about it like I'm
there for hours we always end up talking
about like random things and you know
life and she had mentioned something
about micro bleeding she told me about
this lady that she knew I guess in the
area that looked for like two years
that's how good she was so I was like
let me see her Instagram page and I went
on it I was like wow this is ridiculous
I thought micro bleeding was tattoos so
I've never been a fan of something
permanent tattooed on your face because
trends change eyebrows change nothing I
am actually on my way to go get my
eyebrows micro bladed so the second time
wait did you just get that wrong yeah so
you're supposed to go they said it could
take three times so you go like five
weeks apart and then it's what's the
left for I don't know a year or so so it
lives it pretty well but not really so I
guess the second appointment will really
fix all the little like spots that
weren't filled in but I'm excited oh
good luck Luke you guys over as the
kitchen you know we started to pool all
day for Hall had some urgency for head
okay turn wherever I got the first
treatment done about five six weeks ago
and I first they were super super dark
and a little bit uneven my brows are so
annoying like I've always had a brow
problem ones a little higher so I always
have to like try and draw them in to
make them like proportional on my face
so in one mirror they'll look perfectly
even and then another they look
different so I guess when she was doing
it it's not her fault I'll show you a
picture like really quick right now one
was just kind of like a little lower so
listen nobody would ever notice it fill
your brows in when they're micro bladed
wait a couple India so it was really no
problem at all I love the results they
were a little dark at first but when I
had like makeup on they look great
without any makeup they looked a little
bit dark but they faded a lot over the
first week so and then they faded and I
didn't get a shot of my eyebrows before
but she's going to wipe it off the
powder once I get there I like going
with my eyebrows done so it should feel
like the idea of how I like to do my
brows so you can see like some of the
strokes definitely lasted I think after
the second round it's going to be
perfect and I probably won't you have to
go back for the third but we'll see but
you definitely want to go to someone
who's experienced and knows what they're
doing because the last thing that you
want are tattooed eyebrows that don't
look natural you want your eyebrows to
look real and natural and puffy and you
know all that so
in a little bit great song will be me
beer so tiny
let you say goodbye just pulled off how
does it usually take to kick in about
waist 10 for 5 minutes
hey thank you sexy so this is done with
nothing right now can you calm really
pale under all this makeup but not with
them yet so we're bringing us mm-hmm
piercing bringing these up also brings
up a little bit little area and I'm
focusing on really making your tail prop
with more color and more density what's
the theme that's not very natural yeah
if you want a guard to make you complete
this right drop this on my face by the
end of the that's plenty my friend
Lindsey the one who referred me to Isha
texted me after she saw your post and
she was like oh my god you did it it
hurts so bad I'm like I didn't even feel
it she's like I'm too afraid like I
wouldn't do it I'm like I'm gonna peel
it at all it really doesn't hurt I mean
some people really hurt you yeah and I
maybe they go too deep there's one
everywhere yeah when you have six blade
five legs out robust to the work groans
oh you're about to get it in Wow so
every shape and size I see
all right the works on this side done
she does the work
yeah oh that was nothing cool here yes I
got it
with us character Gaucho cross-browser
so now we're going to come back in and
all these clocks that we trusted I've
stretched as good you can I don't know
if you can see them on your camera
mm-hmm
we're going to come in and we're going
to reinforce that cover and cover all
these tiny little bit I think we should
leave it like that that was really good
so this is a different blade now this is
a bigger blade an hour so I don't have
to put a lot of pressure just finish of
the blade goes in I'm going to need to
do so that's not a lot of this right
I was really to get like the color like
the thickness minimum you realize the
small pieces the normal things to see
with bleeding are little drops of
bubbles of blood okay morning that there
are things much trauma to the skin if
that's a really deep if you keloid at
that point you can turn a different
color can't appeal revision effect too
deep into the layers right
you anything no this is kind of very
slightly burned a little bit but nothing
make up fix and everything stay away
remember yeah it looks so good though
crazy so much beauty bars bar located in
the menu Jersey which is finishing car
leave eyebrows and they look fabulous
amazing wings it to share everything we
did from the beginning of the journals
now if you like to come over to us all
see our makeups video and we offer all
different types of eyebrow work from
watch aims to reshape you for
microwaving and eyelash Americans well
thank you so we just finished up I'm in
the car
eyebrows are looking good so I'll get
the real full specs ones you can finally
wash off all my makeup and all that good
stuff so I think we're tonight I have to
just use like a white and like wash
around my eyebrows I can't touch them
with anything just clean them with the
sterile water well me know that's about
it
so I think it's a really awesome thing
to do you guys have thinner eyebrows and
you want to try it out for especially
for like the summer when you're at the
beach and all that but it's definitely
not a necessity it was just a cool
little thing I wanted to try so hope you
guys enjoyed that little process we
create just a little bit
what is it
what is it kids mmm you hungry too bad
