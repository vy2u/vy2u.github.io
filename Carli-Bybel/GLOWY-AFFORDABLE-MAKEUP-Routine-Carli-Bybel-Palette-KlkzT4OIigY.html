today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here I
wanted to do something affordable and
simple for Valentine's Day the other two
looks that I did create one was more
dramatic and one was like in-between so
this is like my daytime Valentine's Day
look so if you guys want to see how I
got this look right here then please
keep watching to start off today's look
I'm using this elf blurring primer and
I'm applying that all over my face this
is the third time that I'm using with
primer and actually really liked it wear
foundation I'm using the LA girl Pro
Foundation it's definitely my favorite
drugstore foundation at the moment I'm
just going to be blending all this in
with my fingers and wiping any excess
product on to the towel that way I don't
have any extra foundation that I don't
need and then I'm grabbing a damp Beauty
Blender and I'm just going to make sure
it's all blended in perfectly the reason
that I've been using my hands lately is
because it gives it a more natural look
overall when you're finished so that's
just a little trick that I have been
doing lately to contour my nose I'm
using this Wet n Wild contour stick and
I am using a little brush to apply it on
the sides of my nose that way it's more
controlled and then I'm also applying it
on the tip and then with my la girl Pro
conceal I'm dotting like five little
dots underneath my eyes in between my
brows bridge of my nose on my chin and
also my smile lines and I'm just going
to be blending all of that in with my
fingers this is going to help really
warm up the product and like melt it
into your skin and it's going to give
you an overall really nice natural but
yet still covered foundation routine now
the nose contour is obviously completely
optional I just prefer it if you guys
don't need to contour your nose or you
don't feel like you want to of course
you could skip that step and just apply
a little bit of highlighter on the
bridge of your nose I'm just blending
all of the nose contour in with this
artiste brush and then I am blending
everything all together with the Beauty
Blender just to cancel out any harsh
lines and make it all stayed in isolate
so to set my under eyes I'm using this
NYX foundation powder I'm not going to
lie I definitely would recommend using a
actual loose setting powder instead of
this as I had mentioned in my last
drugstore video I can't seem to find a
cruelty free drugstore powder I
misplaced the NYX one that I had so I
just had to use what I had for the
moment so although my makeup came out
really nice I would say throughout the
day it just started getting a little bit
creepy underneath my eyes so if you guys
want to prevent that definitely replace
this step with some loose powder and
then let it sit for a little bit and to
just dust it away so to bronze up my
face I'm using this la girl I believe
it's a foundation powder this is my
first time trying it and I wanted to try
it from bronzer and I figured this was
nice because it's like matte and I'm
going to use a highlighter today which I
normally don't use so I wanted to keep
most of the other products matte so I am
darkening up my face as you can see the
foundation was a little bit light
compared to my body color so this is
when I'm going to start bronzing
everything up to match my face with my
body
this product is super pigmented like a
little bit goes a long way which is
really cool so I just wanted to fill you
in on that as well and with a paper'd
blending brush I am just applying that
on the sides of my nose and then with
this bigger brush I'm just going to be
blending upwards just to blend like the
powder into the foundation powder just
so it all fades really nicely and then
with my damp Beauty Blender I'm just
going to kind of bounce all over my face
just to make sure everything is blended
nicely so I'm using this new elf
highlighter that I picked up at the
store and I'm using it kind of like as a
bronzer just to kind of add a little bit
of shimmer I just wanted to know if I
was going to apply highlighter which I
will later on as well but it's just
going to give my cheeks a nice glow so
for today's look I'm using my Carli
bybel palette I am using these shades
that I use literally almost every single
day I'm using the lighter mob shade in
decrease of my eye with a large blending
brush then I'm picking up the darker mob
shade with a smaller blending brush and
I'm applying that on the outer V and up
into the crease as well
then picking up the first highlight
shade I'm highlighting right underneath
my brows and I'm also highlighting in my
tear ducts and I wanted this look to be
super like bright and glowy so I'm
extending the shadow out really close to
where my nose contour stars
sobriety not my tear ducts a little bit
more I'm using this Amanda steel and
color Pop Collaboration shadow and I am
dragging that out about half way on my
lower lash line I'm then taking up that
darker mob shade and applying that on
the outer half of my lower lash line and
then I'm picking up a little bit of that
dark plum color and I'm applying that
just on the outer V to add a little bit
more depth and then for mascara I'm
using the NYX mascara that I used in my
last video as well I really like this
one so I'm going to continue to
highlight my face with that first
highlight shade I am highlighting the
bridge of my nose on my lips I didn't do
this not today just for all of you guys
that were requesting I try something new
but in the Piatt today but I am going to
be applying on my cheeks which normally
I don't you guys know I've been like
loving a matte face but it's always fun
to add a little bit of shimmer and I
figured I would add some glow because
we're gonna do like a fresh glowy look
her lips amazing this NYX pencil and
then for the liquid lipstick I'm using
this one by color pop I'll just have my
head I don't know the name but I will
list it of course below for you guys and
then I'm using the shimmery pink elf
blush and after I applied it I just felt
like my cheeks were just too shimmery so
I'm going to go in with my BH blush
palette and I'm going to pick up that
mob tone and I'm going to apply that
right over it because it's going to just
like mattify the cheeks a little bit
more I just felt like with that shimmery
bronzer and then the highlighter and
then the highlighted blush it just was a
little too much I just feel like my skin
looks a little too textured when I apply
to many shimmery products so this is the
final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I hope you all have an
amazing Valentine's Day no matter what
you're doing I love you guys so much
thank you for watching and I'll see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
