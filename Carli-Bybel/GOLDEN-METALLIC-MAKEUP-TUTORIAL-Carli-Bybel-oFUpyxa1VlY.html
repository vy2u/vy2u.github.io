today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this metallic submarine makeup
look I had a few other video ideas in my
actually sat down and trying to film -
yesterday they ended up being a complete
fail so I'm not going to be uploading
them I was gonna get ready and film
something else but I figured you know
what I'm going to record myself getting
ready because I wanted to try acting me
do a swamp clean palette by graveyard
girl it's really awesome and there was
just so many like bronzy tones in it
that I figured you know what I'm going
to do that and pair it with like a cool
new metallic lip I just got in the mail
the Milani ones and also the Kylie
metallic lips so I got the ones in like
the similar shades but I ended up mixing
these two for the lips because the
Milani one although it's so pigmented so
amazing it's not 100% realistic like I
wouldn't go out with just this one on so
I mix the kylie one on top of it and the
kindly one is a little bit more subtle
so it just kind of was a perfect
combination and that's how we got the
lips right here so if we guys want to
see how I got this makeup look please
keep watching to start off this look I
am applying a concealer on my eyelid and
I'm blending it in so originally I
wasn't going to do a makeup tutorial but
after I did my face I decided to film
how I was gonna do my eye shadow so I
promised my next video I will be showing
a full face routine I know a lot of you
guys prefer that so to start off today's
look I am using the new palette that
bunny designed with Tarte cosmetics it's
the swamp Queen palette and as soon as I
saw all the colors I knew I wanted to
try it out today and it just inspired me
to create this all metallic look I'm
applying the color SF s on the inner
third of my eye I'm gonna be applying
three colors on my eyelid so I'm going
to be chopping it into three different
sections next I'm picking up the color
sassy bun and I'm applying that in the
middle part of my eyelid and then I'm
going in with the color sippy sippy and
I'm applying that on the outer third of
my eye
next up I'm grabbing a clean blending
brush and I'm just gonna blend out the
brown shade a little bit then with a
large blending brush I'm picking up the
color natural peaches and I'm applying
that up in my crease it's a really light
orange color and then I'm going in with
the darker orange which is called Dogman
and I'm applying that closer to my lid
so it's gonna give it a really pretty
blended look so this is the first time
I'm trying out this palette and I really
really love it it's super pigmented and
I love all of the colors it's right at
my alley so I wanted to say
congratulations to bunny it's such a
beautiful palette and I definitely give
it my two thumbs up so I am just working
on the outer part of my eyelid I use the
little sponge just to get like a
straight line if you don't have any
makeup on prior you can use a makeup
wipe to clean it up and make it look a
little bit neater but if you already
have your face makeup on you can use a
Beauty Blender as well and it does
basically the same thing for eyeliner
I'm using the color wicked by Sigma I do
have a coupon code for everything on the
Sigma site I will list that below for
you guys to highlight my tear ducts I'm
using the color Gator wings and then I'm
also highlighting underneath my brow
now I'm just going back in with the same
shadows and I'm just darkening them a
little bit so I'm using this small
precise brush and I'm just making sure
it looks super neat and I'm just
repeating the same steps that I had done
originally I just ran upstairs to
double-check the brush that I'm using
right here is by morphe it's the m1 70 -
4 brush I absolutely love this you can
use it for shout out or lips and I do
have a coupon code for you guys for
morphe as well so then I am doing the
same thing with the brown as well
darkening it and then going back in with
my blending brush and then I'm just
blending it out then I'm taking the same
small precise brush with the brown and I
am just drawing in my crease a little
bit darker and sharper that way just
looks neater from further away
and then I'm taking my pencil brush and
I'm just blending up that line a little
bit to make it look more blended then
with my blending brush I'm just blending
again and going back in darkening again
and yeah you guys get the idea so you
just want to keep repeating that until
it's as dark as you want until you're
getting the right pigment that you guys
want so it's a process take your time
with it on my lower lash line I am using
the rose gold pigment from graftobian
which is the most amazing pigment ever
one of the videos that I tried filming
yesterday was like the dripping rose
gold lip that I had seen all of our
Instagram and it just didn't look good
on me this is Coco
I get useless like that I can focus on
setbacks tonight
the one spray shine highlight yes when
comments Brett was leaving and he had to
come interrupt my video obviously so
back to the under eye I am using the
color uncommon which is a pretty
metallic purple and that is going on the
outer half of the lower lash line so for
lashes i am using strip tease by violet
boss for mascara i'm using the tarte one
in the gold packaging the one that i
have been using all of the time i can't
remember the name of it off the top of
my head and for eyeliner I found this
honest Asya one I think it's called like
pure gold and I didn't even know I had
it but I wanted to try it because so
beautiful when you swatch it it didn't
show up as much as I wanted in the inner
lash line but I think it's made for the
outer part of your eye so it is a really
beautiful shade but going in with my Kat
Von D shade and light palette I am
bronzing up my face last week and I went
to the beach for the first time and I
don't even know how long and I got so
sunburned so I'm actually covering up my
tan lines with this sharp it was bad me
and Brett were both bright red because
we didn't anticipate on
in the beach so we were only out there
for about an hour and we didn't have our
sunscreen with us so both of our white
skin turned really red real quick but
right now it's turning into a tan which
I'm really happy about so going in with
highlighter I'm using this new glow kit
by anastasiya I am picking up the gold
shade on the top row and I am
highlighting my nose these are always so
pigmented and so creamy and so amazing I
actually just opened the box today so I
opened up this box and I open up the
metallic lipsticks and also the eye
shadow palette so that was what really
inspired this whole look I was like you
know what I want to try some new
products today and I was really really
happy with all of them which is really
cool because I would have hated if I
filmed this whole look and didn't like
how it turned out but I am just adding
extra highlight then I have applied it
in a long time I just feel like making
this look super shiny so feel free to
add as much highlighter as you guys want
for lips i'm using the color natural by
nyx and i'm just lining my lips as i
normally would then i am applying the
Milani lipstick originally i swatched
these two on my hands the kylie and the
Milani and I was going to use the Milani
today because it was a lot more metallic
looking and it just seemed more
pigmented than the Kylie one so I did
apply it on my lips and it was
definitely more pigmented than I even
expected so I applied this first I
looked at it for a little bit and I was
like you know what I need it toned down
a little bit if I would realistically
wear this out which I only like to show
you guys looks that I would personally
wear myself so I apply the Kylie
lipstick over it and it just happened to
be the perfect metallic finish so if you
guys are in the market for either one it
depends on what you guys are looking for
I think they're both really really great
but it's again all about preference I'll
show you guys the swatch of both of them
next to each other that way you guys can
decide if you want both or if you want
one over the other so I actually really
like how the matte lip looks I'm going
in with my BH nude blush palette there's
a peach shade in it which I am using on
my cheeks and then I'm just going to go
back in with the lip liner I'm just
lining the edges and I'm going to like
fill it in a little bit just to add a
tiny bit more of color on the outer part
of my lips I don't know why but I feel
like naked if I don't have a lip liner
showing with my lipstick I don't know
weird I just have to always go back in
with the liner so I'm doing that and I'm
grabbing the bronzy highlighter from
that same palette and I'm just applying
a little bit on my cheeks and a little
bit on my forehead just to
yourself glow a little bit more why not
I'm taking a little bit more of that
gold highlighter and I'm just applying
it on my collarbones
so anytime I go out I always like to add
a little bit of highlighter on to my
chest especially if it's showing all
obviously only if it's showing I just
like the look of a highlighter on the
boobs and on the chest so that's all
about preference it's up to you guys if
you want to try it go ahead if not you
could skip that step and then to set
everything I'm using the Gerrard setting
spray and the color and the flavor
whatever you want to call it lavender
and yeah so that is it
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this metallic bronzy look I
feel like this is the perfect look for
I'm night out and summer it's super
bronzy super glowy and of course the
metallic lip is awesome I wasn't sure
how doesn't feel about it but I actually
really really love how it turned out so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
