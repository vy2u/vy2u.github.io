those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and today I let Google pick my
makeup I saw this challenge originally
on Niki tutorials page he's one of my
favorites here on YouTube and I really
wanted to try it out for today's look so
when I googled the image I was like oh
gosh what am I gonna do but I knew it
would be bright colors and I know you
guys have been requesting some more
bright makeup looks so if you guys want
to see Google pick my makeup and see how
I got this look right here then please
keep watching so for those who haven't
seen this challenge before what you have
to do is type in the first letter of
your first and last name and then type
look after it and then whatever image
pops up first on Google Images is the
image that you have to go off of so this
is the image right here we have a lovely
motorcycle with royal blue paint and
like orange and yellow detail on it so I
am just gonna give it a go and see what
the heck I come up with I hope it comes
out decent so first I'm gonna use the
cover FX primer it's the blurring primer
and I'm just gonna apply it wherever I
get like really oily which is usually
just like on the sides of my nose on my
nose and then like in between my brows
and on my forehead so I have a little
bit of like a body bronzer on so I'm
gonna make my siste match my body so I'm
gonna try the Born This Way Foundation I
have it in warm beige and sand I'm just
gonna adopt this all over my face and
we're gonna blend it in
to contour my nose I'm gonna be using
this graftobian warm palette the darkest
shade and then for concealer I'm using
the shake tape in the color medium I'm
gonna do a little bit right down the
sides next to my nose to blend the nose
contour out I might think a little bit
of the dark color with this brush and
just kind of bronze up a little bit just
because I do have the bronzer on and the
concealer are lightened up my foundation
a little bit we just want to balance my
air conditioning just turned on like a
heavy so you can right
I'm going to set my under eyes with some
Ben Nye cameo powder and then we're
gonna go in with browse my anastacio
brows in Ebony I'm gonna take a little
bit of this shade for my shoot and light
palette and I like to do this before I
wipe away the powder because it's gonna
lighten it up a bit and I'm just gonna
take a little bit of like a setting
spray this one is the queen of Hungary
mist drench my face and now we're ready
to move on to the eyes
wish me luck so first I'm just gonna
take a little bit of my concealer and
apply that all over my eye so I'm gonna
blend that in with my finger that way I
can get everything the same color I'm
then grabbing this matte yellow shade
from the Natasha's anona sunset palette
and with a sigma e40 I'm going to be
blending that right into my crease so
we're just gonna blend that in almost up
to the brow and I really wanted like a
bright yellow to start so obviously if
you guys want to recreate this look I
know color pump has a really similar
palette so this one that's a lot cheaper
so I will link both of them for you guys
so next I'm grabbing the Jacqueline Hill
palette and I'm going in with this matte
yellow shade it's a little bit of a
darker yellow so we're gonna apply that
darker yellow right below the bright
yellow a little bit closer to my crease
then I'm grabbing this burnt orange
shade from the Jaclyn hill palette
so now moving on to the lid I'm gonna
pick up this bright blue shimmer shade
with my finger and I'm gonna apply that
right directly onto my lid this is such
a pretty blue so I'm just going to get
as much as I can on and then I'm gonna
grab a little bit of this light teal
color and I'm gonna apply that towards
the inner part of my eyelid
so with my pencil brush and this burnt
red shade I'm just gonna apply that
right below the orange and I'm gonna
blend that red into the blue because we
want it to look like decent I'm gonna
use the pencil brush first and then I'll
go in with like a blending brush but the
run will help transition like that
bright blue into the orange in yellow so
I'm grabbing a tiny bit more with my
blending brush like red and we're gonna
just blend down and up
snow feeds a little bit nicer it doesn't
look so harsh and since there's a little
bit of a silver detail on the bike I'm
gonna pick up this champagne color and
apply that right under the brow so the
seat and the tires are black so we're
gonna apply a little bit of eyeliner
this one is by Tarte it's the tortise
liner from mascara I'm gonna use this
one by buxom I have eyelash extensions
so I'm not gonna use any false lashes
today so now I'm gonna line my inner
lower lash line with this urban decay
liner in the color Sabbath and I'm gonna
line my lower lash line with the blue
from the Jacklyn palette and I'm gonna
take a little bit of that burnt orange
I'm gonna apply it under the blue and to
see how it looks a little bit of the
yellow
and a drop of that red actually right
under the blue because I think it just a
little better
so the eyes are done we're gonna bronze
up the face with my shade and light
palette I actually really like the eyes
really colorful definitely different um
I feel like I had like a tropical sunset
on my face not mad about it
so I actually leave for Nashville
tomorrow one of my good friends getting
married so we're going for her
bachelorette party so I'm really excited
for that so it's not quite a tropical
island getaway but it should be a fun
little trip so to highlight my face and
my nose today I'm gonna go and with the
Jackie aina and artist Couture la peach
highlighter I'm so excited to try this I
have been dying to try it and I know
it's now available at Sephora which is
amazing so congratulations to both
Jackie and Angel and this amazing
accomplishment so this is like a
beautiful beautiful golden highlight so
I'm gonna grab a clean brush and I'm
gonna dip a little bit in and apply it
onto my nose so nice
I'm gonna take a little more and I'm
gonna apply that here as well because I
think it's necessary and a little bit on
my Cupid's bow and because we're going
all out for taste look I'm gonna apply a
little bit on to my cheeks silver lips
I'm using the colour hush-hush by a
buxom and we're gonna use the colour
quickie by the Sheila and color pop
collaboration and then I also really
want to try this ultra McCloskey lip in
color neat-freak
high a little bit right on the center so
pretty and I like to apply the gloss
like right on my Cupid's bow this will
help make your lips look bigger I love
this lip combo it looks so nice and then
a for blush I am using the color x-rated
from Kylie cosmetics and then to finish
off this look you just gonna spray a
little bit more
so this is the final result I actually
really loved how it came out
