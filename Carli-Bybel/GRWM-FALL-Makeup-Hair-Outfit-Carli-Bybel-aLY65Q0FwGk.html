her moment right there she's a piece of
work
so to start at this look I'm using the
Nivea sensitive skin post shave balm I
tried this out when nikkietutorials was
raving about it when I used it I noticed
that my makeup stay down all day and it
just looked so much better when I used
it so I've been using this under my
foundation every single time now for
foundation I'm using this cream
foundation palette it's by graftobian
and if you guys are just doing makeup
for yourself and you don't need all of
these colors they do sell I believe it's
like a row of five different shades so I
will link the website that way you guys
can check it out but I got the entire
kit because I like mixing different
colors and plus here and there I'm still
doing makeup for other people so that is
why I got the full thing but I just love
it because a little bit of product goes
a long way it's so so so pigmented and I
like to blend it all in with a damp
Beauty Blender the reason that I also
like using this kit is because I'm
applying the lighter foundations and the
areas that I'm gonna eventually
highlight and the darker colors where
I'm going to contour and I like using
the darker color to also match up with
my chest and my neck so it's just an
easier way to get two different colored
foundations in one moving on to nose I'm
using the only product that I ever used
for my nose this is the LA girl Pro
conceal and beautiful bronze so I'm just
drawing parallel lines down the sides of
my nose I'm then going in with that same
palette and I'm picking up a darker
foundation shade and I'm just going to
carve out my cheekbones a little bit
also apply it on my forehead and on my
jaw line I only do a cream contour when
I know I'm going to be going out and I
want my makeup to last all night long so
you can skip this step and only do
powders to bronze up in contour but when
I'm going out and I'm doing like a full
face I love doing both because the
powder will just stick to the cream
contour and it just looks extra good in
my opinion so the beauty of having cats
is you have to rip off hairs from your
face and your Beauty Blender the entire
time but moving on to concealer I'm
using the NARS creamy concealer in the
color macadamia why do I feel like that
doesn't sound right
you know when you say something that
just doesn't sound like the right name
it could be wrong yeah I just looked it
up it's macadamia I don't know what I
was even trying to say over there but
yeah so I'm just blending that in with
my Beauty Blender I love my Beauty
Blender because just blends everything
so much smoother and I feel like it
leaves more products on your face so to
set underneath my eyes I'm first just
gonna blend out the wrinkles and then
I'm using the Ben Nye neutral set and
I'm just dabbing that underneath my eyes
I don't like baking my entire under eyes
I like doing it just directly right
under my eyes not like that hold
downwards triangle because I like to use
the foundation powder which I'll show
you guys later on it just covers better
in my opinion
and I'm also applying that right
underneath my cheekbones just to again
make my cheekbones pop a little bit to
fill in my brows I'm using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow is I am using the
color evany so I don't know if you can
tell right now but I just had my hair
dyed on Tuesday morning so it's a little
darker than I wanted but I know it's
gonna fade so my hair is a little darker
which means my eyebrows have to be a
little bit darker so I switched over to
the Ebony so once I fill those in I'm
just going in with a little brush and
I'm wiping away the rest of the loose
powder and once all the excess loose
powder is off I'm just using my Beauty
Blender to just press the powder into
the skin then with my Kat Von D shade
and light palette I'm picking up the
grayish and a little bit of the middle
shade and I am just contouring over the
cream contour with a tapered brush this
is just to set the contour which is also
just an accentuated it's gonna look a
little heavy but I'll show you guys also
how I lighten that in a little bit
so to set my brows i'm using the
anastasia clear brow gel which is one of
my favorites for eyes i'm picking up the
35n palette from morphe i also have a
code for you guys and i will show you
guys right in the left side which shadow
that i'm using because there are so many
but i am just applying that right into
my crease with a blending brush
then I'm dipping my brush into my
setting spray and I'm picking up the
darker cranberry color from the same
morphe palette and I'm applying that
right on the outer V of my eye I always
like to dip my brushes in some sort of
liquid because it brings out the
pigments so much more so I don't care if
it's a cheaper palette with less
pigmentation if you're wetting your
brush you're going to get much more
pigmentation so just a little tip I'm
sure most of you guys know that by now
but I just wanted to share it just in
case not so then I'm picking up the
color blazing by anastasiya and I am
mixing that with the orange shade from
the morphe palette and I am blending
that into my crease with a big blending
brush
I'm going back in with my smaller
blending brush and that same color to
just darken up the shadows a bit I feel
like with any dramatic looks that's kind
of what I do I like doing the draft
first and then I'll go back in and I'll
darken all the shades just to make sure
it looks perfect so again we're going
back in with the larger fluffy brush and
we're blending those same two colors
together I'm then picking up the second
highlight shade from my Carli bybel
palette and I'm applying that right on
the inner half of my eyelid and I'm also
applying that in my tear duct for liner
I'm using my tart tart East liner and I
basically do my eyeliner the same every
time and that's just because I know how
to make my eyes look more longer and
more larger so that's kind of why I
always like the wing and then the
extended inner corner so it's just
really all about preference with a
pencil brush I'm picking that same dark
cranberry color and I'm blending that
into my crease I'm going to make it a
little more smoky in the crease I didn't
like how light and shimmery it was
looking with just my highlight shade in
the inner part so that's why I decided
to do that
I'm then picking up the color conceded
by artist Couture and these highlighters
are literally incredible they're so
pigmented and so sparkly so I'm just
applying a little bit right in the
center of my eyelid just to give it a
little bit of pop and also some sparkle
I'm then picking up those same cranberry
colors with a pencil brush and I am
smudging it out on my lower lash line
I'm picking up a little bit of the color
Anastacio hot chocolate and I'm adding
that in just to darken it up a little
bit as well
and to fill in my lower lashline I am
using this dark brown liner from
colour-pop I'm not sure the exact shade
but I'll listed below for you guys
moving back on to my face to set the
cream contour and bronze up I am using
the same Kat Von D shade and light
palette and I'm just applying this on my
cheekbones around my forehead on my
jawline and also down my neck so now to
set my under eyes and to basically erase
any lines or imperfections I'm using the
Kat Von D foundation powder and you
could see how it just kind of blurs out
any of the darker parts on my face so I
absolutely love using this to set my
concealer I think it just covers a
little bit better than the loose powder
for blush I'm using this BH nude blush
palette I'm first using this lighter
pink color and then in a little bit I'm
going to show you guys I'm going to go
in a little bit more like an orange tone
but to highlight my nose I'm using my
Carli bybel palette the second highlight
shade and I'm just doing an exclamation
point on my nose as always and I really
feel like this is like the best nose
contour tip to do the exclamation point
it just really really finishes off the
whole nose contour
so for lips I'm using a new brand that
I've recently started using its mellow
cosmetics and the color is Shanghai
I love these liquid lipsticks because
although they dry matte they still feel
a little bit creamy so you don't have to
worry about them drying out too much and
leaving like those weird lines on your
lips I kept this on all day and
literally lasted through food through
everything and they also have vitamin E
in them which helps keep your lips
moisturize do you have a coupon code for
the website which I willis below for you
guys but now I'm just going in with this
darker blush just to give it a little
bit more of like an orange e reddish
tone instead of that pink tone that I
had before and then I'm just using a big
fluffy brush and just kind of like
blending everything all together and
then to set my face I'm using the Gerard
setting spray and the lavender flavor I
know people get mad for some reason when
I say flavor I know it's not flavor
because you're not eating it but then
what would you call it like Oh fragrance
lavender fragrance lavender smell I
don't know you guys get the point so
today I decided I'm gonna do some big
curls in my hair so I'm using the
Bellamy 12 in one curler I believe this
is the one and a half inch head so it's
gonna give you like bigger curls lash
waves so I'm just wrapping the hair
towards my face and I'm just gonna
repeat the same thing all throughout my
hair so I'm just gonna show you guys one
side I feel like I've done so many hair
tutorials so you guys I'm sure at this
point know how to curl your hair but I
like to keep it on until I feel the heat
coming through then when I remove it
from the heat I just hold it in place
for a little bit to help it set and cool
a little bit and then you should be good
to go
so once I did that whole side I'm using
the sebastian shaper plus hairspray and
I'm just using a little bit because I
hate when my hair sticky I always use
like the smallest amount of hairspray
and it works for me so I guess it's all
about preference however your hair is if
you need more and a little bit more if
you don't like it sticky then you know
less hairspray is better
so for the entire head I just let the
curls kind of cool in my hand and then I
just let them fall but for the front
pieces I always like to pin them up with
a bobby pin that way they stay more curl
than the rest of the hair so as you can
see I have two little cute horns on my
head but I'm just going to let them sit
until they're cooled and then I will
spray it one last time and then I will
remove them and you'll see they're a
little bit more bouncy than the rest of
the hair so I always find that my front
pieces fall a lot quicker than the rest
of my hair so that's just why I
personally like to do it so once you
have curled your whole head spray a
little more hair spray and then I like
to just kind of scratch my roots and
then shake it a little bit to like
loosen up the curls a bit I'm using the
dry bar triple sec spray which adds some
texture and yeah that's how I did my
hair makeup so now it's time for an
outfit so thank you guys for getting
ready with me today I know it's been so
long since I've posted a makeup look or
