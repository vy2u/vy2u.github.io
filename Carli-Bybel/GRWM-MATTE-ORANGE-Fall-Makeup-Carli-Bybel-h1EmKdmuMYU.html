today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this hair makeup look right here I
wanted to do something like oranjee for
October October is one of my favorite
months not just because my birthday is
in October but because I just love when
the weather starts to get a little bit
cooler one of my favorite things ever is
when all the leaves start changing
colors as well so yesterday morning I
drove up north I was actually going to
see a medium um she didn't end up being
that good but I will find someone good
undetermined but on my way up there I
haven't been to that part of Jersey in a
really long time it was like up north
and there's like a lot of like mountains
and like a lot of big hills and stuff
like that and there were so many trees
and all of the trees were all beautiful
fall colors like the oranges and the
Reds and the greens and just like so
many beautiful colors together so I just
got like lost like looking out the
window and just like looking at how
beautiful everything was so that kind of
inspired my video today I really wanted
to do a fall look using some of those
like burnt orange colors so that is how
I got this look today so if you want to
learn how I got this hair and makeup
look please keep watching so the first
thing I'm going to be using for my skin
is my skinning daily dose serum so when
I was in Ibiza back in like mid
September I went with the company skin
Inc and I got to learn all about their
new products what's really cool about
the serum is you can custom create it
for your own skin so since everyone has
different skin it's kind of unrealistic
to assume that every serum or every face
lotion stuff like that would work on
every different skin tone so when I
heard all about this product I was
really excited to create my own so I
have three different serums mixed into
my custom serum you can pick which color
bottle also which is cool of course I
picked the pink one and I don't know if
you guys can see but there's like little
beads inside so I've been using a little
bit before I apply my makeup I apply it
all over my face and what's also cool
about the serum as you can apply
underneath your eyes I know with some
skincare they say you shouldn't use it
like around your eyes and stuff like
that you should use more like an eye
cream but with this one you can use it
all over your eyes so I've been applying
this before my makeup ever since I got
it and also at night time I just really
love how my skin feels afterwards and I
also noticed like my under eyes don't
get as cakey when I apply the serum
under my eyes so I'm just going to apply
like a little bit extra right under my
eyes because when I was first getting
back from Ibiza probably from traveling
and everything I just had really really
bad dry under eyes and also I had the
eczema on my eyes so lately it's been so
much better which is awesome so sink air
is really really important especially
when you're applying your makeup because
I know I saw some things on the Nivea
post shave balm and that people's pores
were getting bigger and what I always
like to do and what I recommend for you
guys if you're new on my channel you
don't know is I always apply a serum a
lotion then my primer and then my makeup
that way it doesn't seep into my skin so
when I do use the post shave balm I do
apply my serum my lotion then the balm
and then even a primer on top of that
that way it's really just like creating
that barrier and my makeup stop sinking
into my skin so to prime my face I'm
using the cover FX mattifying primer
this one has the anti acne treatment in
it and I'm just applying that all over
my face I feel like it's been a really
long time since I've done a talked
through video I've been doing like a lot
of voiceovers so I figured in today's
video I would just do talk through
update you guys on some things and just
do a little chitchat because it's been a
while so for foundation I'm using my
graftobian palette this is the one that
I've been using for the past couple of
months I really really love this product
because a little bit goes a long way
it's so pigmented so you can put a thin
layer and it's gonna cover really nicely
so if you guys do need like a fuller
cover foundation but you don't want it
to be like cakey definitely try this
type out it's really really nice and
I've been loving it lately but I'm using
this color right here and I'm just going
to apply that on my face
and then you're going to blend it all in
with a damp Beauty blender hi babe hi so
my birthday is in four days so let me
know if you guys want me to film like a
birthday makeup look I have a dinner
with my family on Saturday and then next
Thursday we're doing the dinner with my
friends so we're doing like a party bus
and we're gonna go to dinner in the city
and then come back to my house
afterwards so that should be fun I'm
really excited I have no idea what I'm
wearing yet I have a couple outfits in
mind so once I figure that out I'll have
like a makeup idea in mind so let me
know please see for brows I'm using my
Anastasia brow Wiz in the color evany
and I'm filling my brows in with the
anastacio evany powder to contour my
nose I'm using my la girl and beautiful
bronze I think my brows look like really
crazy right now
for concealer I'm using creamy beige
also by la girl for being so affordable
these concealers are honestly like my
favorite I haven't used the creamy beige
in a while but I used it last night for
the first time and I noticed like my
makeup just stayed on really really
nicely so I'm gonna get back to it for
now
and then the concealer with my Beauty
Blender
so I do plan on doing maybe like two or
three Halloween videos I'm just waiting
on a couple more costumes to come in
maybe leave some suggestions below but I
did purchase a couple costumes as I ment
as I just mentioned so I will try and
get this up for you as soon as possible
to set my under eyes I'm using the
neutral set by Ben Nye
you can also set like on the sides below
the contour if you want you don't have
to I just like to do that and then
whenever is left on the Beautyblender I
just go like do my little smile lines if
you go like this it helps prevent
anything from creasing into those lines
and then I'm just gonna wipe away the
powder with my Sigma t-bird highlighter
nothing's on my Beauty Blender but I
just like to push in any of that powder
that way anything that didn't rub off is
just gonna be good sorry my cats are
playing in a box right now so if you can
hear on I apologize with my Sigma e45
tapered blending brush and my Kat Von D
shade and light palette I'm taking a
little bit of these two colors and I'm
just gonna set my nose contour and when
I do this I just have a very very light
hand because I don't like adding too
much product then it gets really hard to
cover so if you just very lightly apply
it it'll be a lot easier to cover like
those lines so you don't have like those
two distinct lines I'm using my Kat Von
D locket powder foundation in the color
light 48 and my Sigma E 52 and I'm gonna
be applying that underneath here to set
the concealer I like using this because
it just covers a little bit better um I
feel like if I didn't contour my nose I
would just use a powder too
probably just like big under my eyes
like most people do but since I like to
hide shadow
next to my nose to help make it appear
slimmer this just covers a little bit
better so
and I'm also applying a little bit on
the sides over the cat Bundy just to
diffuse the color a little bit so it's
not like so crazy I like look back at
how I used to contour my nose I'm like
oh my god I had lines down the side of
my face like no F's to give just walking
around with lines on my face so this is
going to help really blend those lines
like into the foundations give it like a
really pretty like smooth transition so
it really looks like your nose and not
like lines Center fees I drink like
three of these a day by the way it's
naturally alkaline and it has a pH of
seven point eight to eight point two so
I like this it's good for eczema they
say do you have water with alkaline in
it so I drink like two or three of those
probably like three closer to three
maybe four a day I am a fish and I'm
obsessed with water so that is like one
of my favorite things ever to drink so
for today's eyes I'm going to try out
the Kiley palette I recently got this
and I haven't tried it out yet I haven't
even watched it like it's literally
brand new so for this look I wanted to
do like all orange tones I'm going to go
in with this color right here and I'm
going to apply that in my crease
I'm then picking up this orange color
right here and I'm going to just apply
that on my lid I want to keep this look
on that since I'm usually only doing
shimmers which I mean I love shimmers
but I figured switch it up a bit
with my morphe M 170 - for took a little
tiny brush I'm going to pick up this
cream color and I'm going to apply that
in my tear duct what I like to do
usually when I'm using my palette
because I have a very similar nude shade
what I like to do especially when I
contour my nose and I'm doing like a
full face look I bring the cream color
up against the side of the contour to
really give it that contrast so it just
kind of like emphasizes the nose contour
a little bit so it's just like a little
trick that I do and you can just like
slowly like blend that into that orange
you can see it just kind of like opens
up my eye a little bit overall first
impressions so far shadows are really
nice I know there was a lot of mixed
opinions with this palette um I do think
it's a little bit pricey but I mean it's
Kylie's palette so she can really sell
it for however much she wants I'm sure
you guys can find duplicates from either
like morphe or even like bah or any of
the more affordable brands it's just
really all about preference so whatever
you guys are feeling I'm gonna use my
Sigma e25 and I'm going to take a little
bit more of that original color and a
little bit of like this darker matte
Brown and I'm just gonna blend that on
the outer B
so if you guys aren't really into
celebrating Halloween and you just kind
of want to do your makeup cool like I
feel like this is a good option if you
want to like go to school and we're just
like cat ears and not really do anything
crazy this is an auction for you guys I
know when I was in high school we
weren't allowed to dress up they like
took that away like as soon as we got
into high school so I just used to do
like my makeup really cool and like
funky lashes and stuff and then that was
like all I did so it's just really all
about preference whatever you guys want
I'm going to grab a little more of this
color right here and I'm just going to
apply that in the inner part and just
drag that into the orange
for liner I'm using the tortise liner
on my lower lashline I'm going to apply
this color
and then some mascara runs up my face
I'm using the Kat Von D she didn't like
palette as always so what's been going
on I don't even remember the last time
that I talked to you guys um we finished
all the crazy construction hallelujah I
would say everything was finished like
two weeks ago
um and then we're just waiting on some
more furniture and everything like that
but it's slowly coming together so
that's really nice I have a lot of
things that I've been working on that I
will be able to share with you guys very
soon so that's really exciting as well
I'm still trying to figure out what to
be for Halloween I we have a Halloween
party to go do and me and Brett don't
know what to bake that is like my next
mission to figure out what I want to be
for Halloween I just feel like I've been
so much already like I'm gonna be 26 on
Monday it's so weird to even say that
but so yeah I've done so many things for
Halloween like there were years that I
was even like to costumes at the time so
I might redo something that I already
done we shall see
but if you guys have any suggestions for
me and Brett definitely let me know so I
was just watching and trying to find
like a good orange lipstick and I was
surprised I didn't have any like burnt
orange colors like a liquid lipstick so
I'm actually gonna go with Kylie's 22
and this was not planned to use all of
her products but it just happened that
way since I don't really have a pretty
burnt orange I feel like this is a good
color so I'm going to line my lips
you
my lips are actually like extra dry
today for some reason so I'm just going
to take a little bit more of my skin Inc
serum and I'm just going to apply that
on my lips so give it a little bit more
moisture without making it shiny I just
feel like this is just too orange not
really what I'm going for
so I'm going to blend in a little bit of
the stripped liquid like lipstick from
Anastacio I feel like I never just wear
one color I'm always mixing and I just
want this a little bit lighter so you
make a drop more and it's like perfect
yes much better kind of like toned it
down a little bit for blush I'm using my
little NARS blush palette that I created
I'm going to mix a little peach and then
a little bit of this color I'm gonna
start actually with the peach and then
once it's like a good color I'm going to
apply a little bit of that Laurens on
top just cuz I don't want to do too much
you
now to tone down everything so it's not
too heavy
I'm using the medium 57 by Kat Von D
with my morphe it's completely gone but
I think it's like mb3 or something just
a little bit and then just do some
circular motions and that's just going
to kind of blend everything together and
tone the blush down so you could see the
difference this little mini brush I'm
picking up my second highlight shade and
I'm gonna just highlight my nose and my
boogers and that is it so so - like
melts everything together I'm using the
skin Inc pure serum mist and this is
just gonna help like blend all the
powders together and everything like
that it's cold I think I'm gonna add a
little bit more eye shadow I was looking
at it and I'm like I just want a little
bit more so I'm gonna pick up a little
bit of this like reddish and brownish
and mix them just make it a little bit
more smokey
so for my hair I'm going to do like a
little half lop ponytail me and Moe went
to a concert it was like Miranda Lambert
Kenny Chesney and Sam hunt back in
August and I had my hair down and it was
so hot when I tell you like ridiculously
gross hot that's how hot it was
so my hair was literally crunched and I
haven't done the keratin in a while so
like all the front pieces got really
curly so she luckily had like a little
mini hair tie like this and I did my
hair like wherever it was really sweaty
I like pulled it half up and when we got
home from the concert that night I was
like I really like your hair like that
and I was like really like it didn't
mean to come out like this like I just
was trying to prevent
curly sweaty frizziness from happening
so I just figured today I'm going to try
to get that same look I feel like when
you don't try sometimes your hair comes
out a million times better but I figured
I would do that for today so the goal is
to just take a little bit of hair um I
have long nails so they double as a comb
so if you need a comb and then you just
literally take like this much hair so
not too much but you also want to make
sure that it's enough where like when
it's all down it looks good too so and
it's even so I'm just straight even like
I need a little bit more on this side
and
Wow I'm using a orange hair tie and I'm
just tying this piece up and then
tightening it and then just like kind of
pull it out I like it messy looking so
literally so easy and then you just
spray a little bit of hairspray and as I
said I like it like kind of messy and
like pushed out if you want it like
super slick you could do that as well
but I just think it looks like kind of
cuter that way so I think I'm going to
just use like one bobby pin for like
this right here I like how it's like
poof so I'm just gonna very lightly
apply that and then 6:06 and then I like
to smooth down my little baby hairs also
quickly wanted to show you guys my new
tattoos this one right here is an ohm
symbol and it's also something else
which I can't tell you guys about yet he
touched over my love he touched over my
open heart and then I also got Milly on
my other finger so me my best friend
Miller nicknames for each other is Milly
and it's just been that since we were in
fifth grade so we were trying to think
of a tattoo we wanted to get together
because we've been wanting one forever
so when I posted a picture with Moo
laughs a lot of people were saying like
did you know that Milly
M oh oh I means beautiful in touch so we
didn't know that like we had no idea so
we figured why don't we just get Milly
on us because it also means beautiful so
she got hers like right here and then I
got mine right on my finger because my
only tattoos are on my finger so I
didn't want to like put it anywhere else
but I really loved how it came out he
touched up mine and then did the new
ones and I'm highly considering getting
the love and this removed and then
him redo it all together just because
like you could see how thin this one is
and it's just so perfect and beautiful
so he did such an amazing job it's
really hard to find someone who can do
tattoos so if anyone's looking for
someone who's really good I will list
his info below for you guys so this is
the final result and I hope you guys
enjoyed this video definitely comment
below and let me know what else you guys
want to see as I did mention I do have a
few Halloween ideas in mind but other
than that I'm always up for a new
suggestion so I love you guys so much
thank you for watching and until next
time I'll see you guys later
