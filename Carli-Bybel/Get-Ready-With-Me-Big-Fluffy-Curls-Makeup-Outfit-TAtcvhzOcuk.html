and see we'll start a little
hide-and-seek if you are have some fun
fine
make a wish
I'll give you anything for just one kiss
there's nothing that you don't in class
but someone so big like you exist
it's all night if you stay we
stars never fade in so
I sneak you live
Oh
I desire
just see
Sam
hello everyone thank you for watching
we're going to start off this look by
using the BH galaxy palette and I'm
using this bronzy color and this is
going to be going all over my entire
eyelid following that I'm grabbing this
gold shadow and I'm applying that right
over the color that I had just put on my
lid grabbing my blending brush and this
light beige color I'm then going to be
applying that right into my crease and
this is just preparing myself for the
darker colors I'm about to use and this
is also going to give it a nice faded
look grabbing this cranberry color with
my smaller blending brush I'm then going
to be applying this right in the crease
of my eye creating an outer V
then very lightly we're going to drag it
into the inner part of our crease
following that we're grabbing that
bigger blending brush and we're just
going to blend this all in then picking
up this dark purple color and this black
shadow we're going to be mixing the two
to create a really dark plum color and
this is just going to be going over that
color on the outer view of my eye and
this is going to add some dimension to
my eye
so next you're going to be applying your
mascara as you normally would and
originally I wasn't going to do an
eyeliner but I'm just taking a quick
little liquid eye pen and I'm just gonna
be drawing a line from where my false
eyelashes end to the inner tip of my eye
because you can kind of see a little gap
so that's why I again I'm applying the
eyeliner next picking up this dark green
color I'm going to be lining my lower
lash line
you
pick up a white eyeshadow and then just
going right under my brow and also in my
tear duct
you
moving on to lips I'm doing my normal 20
by Jordana all over my lips following
that with creme de nude by Mac I'm just
taking a little bit of a vanilla pigment
and I'm highlighting my Cupid's bow and
that's just gonna make your lips up here
a little bit larger for lipgloss I'm
using by color your smile and nude it is
my favorite nude lipstick if you haven't
noticed already and for the final step
for my face I'm applying some pink blush
and just smoothing that in with my Sigma
brushes so that is it for the makeup now
let's move on to the hair to get some
big voluminous curls so moving on to
hair you're going to first want to
section your hair off pulling little
pieces at a time I'm using this Pro
Tools curling iron and I got this on
Amazon about two maybe three years ago
and it works so good and it's only like
$15 so I will link that below but I love
the curling iron because it's different
than the curling one it's gonna give you
a nice bouncy full-looking curl as
opposed to just like the bigger waves or
the curlier waves that the wand would
give you for this look I also clipped in
the Lily hair by Bellamy and to be 100%
honest I do love the hair it's great
quality as all Bellamy hair is but I
didn't notice a huge difference from the
220 gram to the 260 gram of course I
said I'm not wearing one of the tracks
but seems like basically the same length
as 222 inch because I did have to cut a
lot off and then cut some layers and of
course to make it blend with my hair but
I will keep you guys posted because in
the beginning all hair extensions are
amazing but I can give you guys a true
review after I've used them for a few
months and I've put heat on them and
I've washed them and everything like
that so definitely stay tuned for that
so as you can see I'm still just
sectioning off my hair and just curling
it what I like to do is I like to curl
the top part let it sit for a few
seconds and then unclip my curling wand
and then pull it all the way through
it's really hard to describe what I'm
doing but you guys can basically see
what I'm doing and once you hold it for
about 10-15 seconds you'll feel the heat
coming through the iron onto your hair
you just use a little hairspray and then
pin it on up
and heaven is super feminine to blow
you're dumb because you know I'm gonna
put the summit
they're holding you closer and more nine
so now back to my hair I'm going to be
sectioning it off I like to do the back
pieces first and I like to curl these up
and then pin them up so it gives you
body if that makes it sense you'll get
what I'm saying when you see how I pin
it up
yourself a merry little Christmas let
your heart be like
from now are not trouble
to be
love side
yourself I'm Mary
Christmas
it's like game
now our our troubles
the way
here we are as enrolled in
happy golden days of yore faithful
Friends who are dear to us gather near
to us once more
years I always like to pull apart all
the curls and just kind of fluff it
around a little bit and I've always been
the type of person to just leave my hair
down I just love it really full and
voluminous and just down I don't really
like any updo so that is it for the hair
feel free to tease the back if you need
more body
with me we could dance all night
in the Sun
I think you live
desire
see
let's be fearless made let's be free
take
we turn
turn let your head go
run away with
we kiss all night interesting so now
that I have my big bow shoes on I'm
ready to go and thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you guys have fun
getting ready with me and I hope you
guys have an amazing holiday and a great
new year I'll see you guys soon
