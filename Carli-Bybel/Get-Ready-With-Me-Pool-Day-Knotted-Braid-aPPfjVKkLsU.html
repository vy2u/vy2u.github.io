I say it's alright
you
little darling it's been a long cold
lonely winter little darling it feels
like you since it's been here she comes
I said she comes there soon and I say
it's alright I'm in love thank you for
watching to start off this look I'm
going to be using my acne spot treatment
for a few of the pimples that I have on
my face I like to apply this underneath
anything that I want to apply my face
that way goes directly onto the pimple
little darling the smiles returning to
the face next up I'm using by Neutrogena
it's called clear face and it is a
sunscreen it does of SPF 30 in it so
you're gonna be nice and protected with
this all over your face little darling
it seems like you sis's spin then to
cover up those pimples I'm using this
concealer that also has acne treatment
in it here comes a Sun and I say it's
all
then I'm grabbing this BB cream this one
is by Lori Allen it's a skin beautifier
and it has an orange tint to it and this
is going to help really brighten up the
face it also comes with a green tint
which is better for those of you with
redness but I decided to use this one
and I'm applying it all over my face
with my favorite sigma foundation brush
so here it comes
sun sand Sun here comes Sun sides then
here it comes
so the only products I'm not using from
a drugstore is going to be to fill in my
brows you can get any eye pencil or an
eye powder whichever you guys prefer I
just like using this one for a more
natural look because it's a lighter
shade and it also has the comma and then
this is so me medicine little dolly it
seems like you see is pinky
she comes a Sun here comes the Sun and I
say it's alright I'm applying a little
bit of concealer under my eyes this one
is by Garnier and it has caffeine in it
so I like to apply this not only because
it's very very thin but also because it
gives it a nice tingly awake feeling and
I love to apply just a little bit Randor
my eyes and then I like to dab it
underneath and also on my lids a little
bit as well and again the reason I love
this concealer is because it's really
thin so it's going to be sweat proof to
add a little bit of color to my cheeks
I'm using this master glaze and I'm
going to be dabbing it onto my cheeks
slowly blending it in I prefer to use
something like this over a powder blush
when I'm going outside in the heat
and for chapstick I'm using my Burt's
Bees and I love this one it's
all-natural and it has a really pretty
poorly finish now to be honest if I were
going to the pool I would probably end
it right here not even bother with
mascara but for those of you who prefer
mascara and can't live without mascara
feel free to add it at this point I
don't own any waterproof mascara just
because they're impossible to get off so
if you prefer that I suggest using that
in place of this so now let's move on to
hair I just want to do something really
easy simple but yet cute for the pool so
I'm going to be doing a knotted braid I
haven't recorded this before but it's a
really fun beachy look I'm going to be
putting all my hair to one side and I'm
going to be pulling out two pieces from
both sides and wrapping it over the hair
once you wrap it over you're going to
tie a knot just like so
so you're going to tie the knot like
this tighten it up then you're taking
these two strands wrapping it around the
rest of your hair you're going to
crisscross it in the back and then bring
the two strands forward once you do this
you're going to take a little bit more
of the hair from each side to add into
those knots and you're going to tie
another knot you're just going to be
continuing the same process over and
over again till you get to the bottom of
your hair so again you're just pulling
two pieces you're knotting it crossing
it over the back pulling the strands to
the front and then grabbing a little bit
more hair to use for the melon
look at her just keeps on getting better
my so we're walking by the shore I've
got something to say words can't
describe the way that I feel when I look
in her eyes
to keep assist
every day I
wouldn't be Yusei
is
with that
I wish we stay like this forever
miles away from everything we've known
there's nothing to fear she's by my side
baby dream day
she
yes
every day
would he be the same
once you finish you're just going to use
a hair tie to secure the braids and then
using a few bobby pins you can just pin
back the hair that is in the front
that's falling out kind of however you
feel comfortable but I always like to
just pin it right back
moving on to what I usually bring in my
beach bag of course I always have a clip
handy for when my hair is wet and I get
out of the pool I'm going to be bringing
more of my SPF 30 face lotion I'm going
to be grabbing a purple towel to match
my swimsuit also I'm gonna be bringing
this Evian water which is an amazing
spray to just rehydrate your face and
I'm also just gonna be throwing in some
of the makeup products that I use for
this look that way I can touch up
throughout the day I'm also gonna be
bringing my wallet and a bottle of water
to stay hydrated so that is it as far as
what I brings me to the pool or the
beach that's also how I do my hair and
makeup I hope you guys enjoyed this
video now I'm gonna go off to the pool
and enjoy my day I love you guys so much
thank you for watching and have an
efficient
we sir
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
