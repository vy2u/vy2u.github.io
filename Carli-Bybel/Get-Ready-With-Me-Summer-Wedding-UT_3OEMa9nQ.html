but if I never recover for you I'll
never be the same
I know
take the other way
hi everyone thank you for watching this
past weekend I went to a wedding so I
decided to film myself getting ready
so first I'm starting out with my hair
that was just the low dried and it's
getting long isn't it whew but I'm still
gonna be applying extension so I'm tying
a little bit up teasing at the root and
then I'm applying the lily hair by
Bellamy I'm only gonna be using three
tracks and this is just basically for
thickness since my hair is about the
same length as it right now I'm gonna
drag my finger through the back bring
all the hair to the front brush it out
and then I'm going to start curling it
I'm using also by Bellamy the six and
one curling wand I love this one because
it comes with six different heads so you
don't have to go out and buy the six
different ones for it I'm using the 25
millimeter head for this one and I'm
just gonna be curling my hair as I
normally do I've done a million videos
like this so if you guys want to see it
in slow motion or if you need more help
just trying it out for the first time I
will link those videos below but for
those of you who have seen all of my
curling videos you know I'm just
wrapping it around and pinning it up
into place
her hair square I'm using by L'Oreal d
element satin and I'm just spraying a
little bit right onto the hair once I
finished it with each side remember to
curl it away from your face
then I'm sectioning off my hair again
and applying the second track of
extensions you're going to want to use
the route again and then just flip them
right along your hairline
once I finished I'm just gonna be
spraying my whole head and then I'm
taking this little scarf that I have to
clip the hair away from my face whenever
I have a formal event or really anytime
I like to comb my hair I like to do my
hair first leave them in the pins do my
makeup and then that way it's going to
last a lot longer so now moving on to
makeup I'm first priming my face with
NYX angel veil then using my Chanel
foundation mixed with this argan oil I'm
going to be applying this all over my
face with my damp Beauty Blender
grabbing this dark brown color from my
makeup forever contour palette I'm then
gonna be applying this on the sides of
my nose with a small brush then grabbing
a larger brush I'm going to be
contouring the hollows of my cheeks also
on the sides of my forehead and under my
chin
using the darkest shade and my brow bar
to go I'm then filling in my brows
to top off the brows I'm using a clear
brow gel now moving on to eyes of course
this part wasn't originally recorded so
I had to go back and rerecord this
beginning part I'm using this melon
pigment on the inner half of my eye then
I'm grabbing this pinkish bronze baked
eyeshadow and I'm applying it on the
outer half of my eye then from this BH
palette I'm picking up this brown color
and my blending brush and I'm blending
it right into the crease of my eye
following that I'm grabbing his darker
cranberry color with a smaller blending
brush I'm applying that right into the
outer V of my eye to line my eyes I'm
using the new black Sigma gel liner and
their new eyeliner brush as well it
makes doing eyeliner that much easier
for lashes I'm using da me up by the lor
taking this liquid gold glitter liner
I'm then lining right above that black
liner and for my lower lash line I'm
mixing this pink and opal color I'm
first lining it with the pink and then
right over that I'm using the white opal
color okay now that I'm finished with my
eyes I'm going to take out these pins
because this hairdo I got going on is
just not cute
so I am taking out my hair it's probably
been about a half-hour once I finish
taking out all the pins I'm then gonna
just spray it one last time and then
finish the last bits of my makeup before
concealer I'm using this one by Makeup
Forever and I'm applying that also with
my damp Beauty Blender right underneath
my eyes on the bridge of my nose and
also on my chin in between my brows
basically everywhere you want to
highlight to set my concealer I'm using
the banana powder by the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit for I
highlight I'm using Mac whisper of guilt
right on my cheekbones also on the
bridge of my nose
and it's a - Wow
never be the same
so now that I finish my makeup I'm just
going to tease my hair a little bit
using the same comb that I use to tease
my roots so I'm just using the back
pieces to give my hair some extra body
once I finished that I'm going to spray
it with a little bit more hairspray and
I'm good to go
never be the same
I don't know where you stay with me
