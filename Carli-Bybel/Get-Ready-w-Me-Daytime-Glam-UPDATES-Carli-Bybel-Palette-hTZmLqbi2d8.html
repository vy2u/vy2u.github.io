today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this hair and makeup look I film
this as they get ready with me style so
that way you can see the full look and I
also wanted to update you guys on a
bunch of things that have been going on
the past couple of weeks thank you all
for being so amazing and patient with me
I've had a ton going on and I will
explain it all to you in this video so
if you want to learn how I got this look
please keep watching so start off this
look I'm using the pores no more primer
by dr. Brandt this one is absolutely my
favorite I'm applying this in a
downwards motion that way it mattifies
your face and it's gonna push down any
hairs that you have on your face next
I'm using me photography fluid that I
mentioned in my previous favorites video
I wanted to show you guys this little
bad boy in action it comes with a little
dropper but I just take a little bit off
the sides and I'm going to apply it on
the high points of my face so I'm just
going to take about that much and then
I'm going to start dabbing it on my
cheeks bridge in my nose in between my
brows basically anywhere that gets
darker I noticed like around my mouth
around my nose on my chin area
it starts to get like um like a grayish
look after a long period of time when I
wear makeup so I noticed that when I
apply this it helps keep it really
bright for a lot longer so if you guys
are doing a makeup look and you need it
to last for hours and hours and hours I
definitely recommend trying this product
it's awesome just using my damn Beauty
Blender and I'm just pushing that into
my skin making sure it's all even for
foundation I am using biko Gendo the
aqua foundation in 113 the shade is a
little bit light for my skin tone so I'm
going to mix in my cover effects drops
and these are in color n40 this has a
little bit of a darker pigmentation so
instead of mixing two foundation colors
you can use these to make your
foundation lighter or darker then with
my foundation brush I'm going to be
mixing the colors together on the back
of my hand and I'm going to start
painting on my phone
this might actually be a little bit too
dark but I can always just add a little
bit more of that lighter Foundation and
it's so crazy I haven't broke out like
pimples like this and I don't even know
how long and I'm not happy about it and
then I'm just blending everything in
with my damp Beauty Blender for brows
I'm filling them in with the brow bar to
go in the darker shade okay so now that
I got the hardest part or the longest
part over with I'm going to start
talking through the rest of this video
I'm so sorry that it has been so long
since I had posted most of you guys know
because you watched my last video that
um my Papa has been in the hospital so
it's been a really hard week it's been
hard to film when I've been there almost
every day so that was the reason I
wasn't able to get anything up for you
guys today is actually two weeks since
he first went in he had fallen and they
had found blood in his brains they had
to operate on him and right after the
surgery he had woken up and he was a
little confused still but he was still
okay and then every day after that it
was just kind of getting worse and worse
and worse he wasn't waking up he hasn't
been up in two weeks yesterday we were
all there and he opened up his eyes for
like a couple seconds so that gave us a
little bit of hope hoping that maybe
he's gonna wake up from this it's in a
really rough couple of days so that is
basically the update on that
once I posted that video and then I
asked you guys to pray for him it was
last Sunday and then that Monday he was
doing a little bit better like there
were some improvements and I was like
yes it's because everyone's praying for
him he's gonna get better and then it
slowly got a little bit worse but then
yesterday again we had some good news um
he opened up his eyes a little but she
hadn't done at all so hopefully fingers
crossed everything will work out for the
better and he will be okay so that is
the update with that we had found a
house a couple weeks ago and we had the
inspection on Friday so it's just been
one thing after and
between the new house that we got and
starting to pack up this place and then
my papa so it's just been craziness um
and my birthday's this weekend so I
don't know just so much going on and
I've just felt very very very
overwhelmed but I'm happy to finally be
back and sitting here talking you guys
because it's been a while and I also
have some updates on my new palette that
has been out of stock forever if they
didn't already post something they
should be posting it today
sorry just gonna get those straight
lines in what happened was it sold out
within I don't know a couple hours they
had not expected as many people to be
buying it obviously so what they did was
they put up a pre-order not a pre-order
where you could purchase it but you
could insert your email so what they are
doing for everybody who signed up with
their email is they're going to be
sending you guys a private link to
purchase the palette once it's in stock
before it goes public so if you guys
haven't signed up to that yet I
recommend signing up to that because you
guys will be the ones that will be able
to get it first everyone will be able to
purchase just one palette so that way we
don't have any eBay problems for the
next batch that's coming in they already
have pre-orders going out so if you guys
were the first 10 or 20,000 that put
your emails in you guys either already
got your palette or it's being sent out
like any day now they have that shipment
already arrived
so again if you guys haven't signed up
for the email on the website do that
immediately because you guys will be the
first ones to get it as they're getting
shipments in every week they're going to
be fulfilling those orders first before
they fully make it public on the site so
realistically I don't think you will see
back in stock on the website until like
November because they're going to get
all those pre-orders out first so go on
their site and then insert your email
and then again like I said they will
send you a private link to purchase the
palette once it's available and you'll
be able to do it before it's available
to the public so unfortunately this is
the way that they have to do it because
they just had no idea that this many
people would be ordering it I had no
idea
this mental would be ordering it either
so you guys are just so amazing thank
you everyone who has been so patient I
know it is literally so annoying so I'm
going to light this site right here if
you guys want to go click it put your
email in and then that way you guys will
be the first ones notified I'm sure a
lot of you guys have gotten the palette
already from the pre-order but if you
haven't yet don't worry it will be
coming just could be a little bit
patient the price is staying at 1250
which is awesome so everyone will get
that same deal I'm pushing them to make
sure that it's backed by holiday season
if you guys want to buy it for gifts or
anything like that it will be officially
back they're saying hopefully the first
week in November it'll be like back in
stock and they'll just have an inflow of
pallets coming in anything changes or
it's back in stock sooner obviously you
know it will keep you updated but
unfortunately this is the best that they
can do right now they hired a whole
other factory of people to start making
the pallets as well so now they have
doubled the amount of people each pallet
is handmade so that is what is holding
that up a little bit so BH is gonna put
out a statement to let you guys know the
same thing I'm basically telling you
because it is unfortunately out of my
control it is all on their end and they
feel really really bad that it has taken
this long and that people are waiting
this long to get the pallets so thank
you guys everyone who already purchased
it and sent me pictures it's so amazing
senior looks and I love that you guys
are loving it as much as I do it's
always so exciting to hear great
feedback and throughout everything that
I've been going through the past two
weeks I swear like just reading all your
comments and talking you guys makes me
feel so much better so thank you as
always for being my friends when I
really needed it to set my under eye I'm
using the laura mercier secret
brightening powder in this same tart
brush
with my Sigma e-40 brush I'm going to be
using this light bronzer color just to
apply a little shadow
into my crease for today's look I just
wanted to do like a winged liner and
then keep it pretty simple for the eyes
the beauty of having a good bronzer /
contour shade can use it for eyeshadow
as well for eyeliner I'm using the Kat
Von D ink liner those wings are not even
girl for lashes I'm using these wispy
drugstore lashes just for a more of a
natural eye look I'm grabbing a little
bit of the shimmery brown color and I'm
applying it on my lower lash line so
right before I put my lashes on I had a
charge pop up on my phone that I used my
American Express and sitting here
filming so no I didn't use my American
Express somebody got my credit card
number and went and spent couple hundred
dollars on walmart.com really nice so I
had to just call and report the fraud
charges I don't know how people get your
credit card number that's just unreal
they're so scummy with this dark matte
brown shade I'm just gonna apply a
little bit of that right into the crease
mixing these two NARS bronzers to warm
up my face a bit I'm just doing very
light strokes so I like broke out I
don't know if it's from stressed my
period or what's going on but I haven't
had like pimples like this in so long
they're not like whiteheads they're just
like bumps anyone has any suggestions
let me know I don't want to be pimply
from a birthday back to the news of the
house we were looking for the past seven
months um our lease was actually up in
August for where we're at now and we
extended it an extra six months because
we hadn't found anything so it actually
worked out perfectly because our closing
date is supposed to be November 20th
which means I have about a month to pack
up this entire house actually it's good
though because this place were and now
we have till February first so at least
it's not like we have to be out of here
by November it's good because I can kind
of slowly pack and get everything over
there for the two months that I'll have
this place still so it all worked out
really good but I'm so excited
we're officially homeowners leasing was
good for us in the beginning because we
didn't know where we wanted to live we
wanted to kind of test it out see what
we wanted and I wouldn't have done it
any other way so I'm glad we got to rent
two places to really see what we want
versus what we didn't want for a
permanent home so when we found this new
house we just fell in love and it's a
great location so we're really excited
about it you just saw my closet tour so
I feel like that room alone is just
gonna be so much fun to pack up really
looking forward to it for blush I'm
mixing these two pink ones right here
maybe a little bit of that peach I love
having them on a pallet like this
because you can just kind of mix and
match
I know this look is nothing special I
just kind of wanted to do something a
little bit lighter on the eyes because
I've been doing I guess kind of more
dramatic looks so what I've been doing
lately is highlighting my nose and not
highlighting my cheeks as much um
summer's over I don't really have a tan
so I kind of stay away from the
highlighter not fully there are days
where I will apply it but today I'm
going to go with no highlighter I just
like to highlight my nose because it
just accentuates the contour and it
makes it look thinner so I'm using this
eyeshadow shade from my palette and just
slowly going to draw a straight line and
then the little ball so it's like an
exclamation point next I'm going in with
a black gel liner just to go over that
Kat Von D line moving on to lips I am
using my Estee Lauder lip pencil in the
color rose and for lipstick I'm mixing
number 25 and number 27 by Milani I'm
using 25 on the outer corners and then
27 in the middle
next moving on to hair I'm using the
Bellamy curling wand this is a part of
their 12 in one kit which is amazing I
just opened it up and how cute is this I
didn't realize it was all pink I love it
um so I'm just gonna put some random
waves slash curls in my hair I showered
last night and then put my hair in a
braid so I also have some leaves already
but I just want to do a couple pieces to
make it a little bit fancy yeah so when
I'm doing big waves I don't want like it
perfect
I don't even section off my hair I just
leave it down and then just slowly grab
pieces and I always found that that was
easier for me when I want to do
something a little bit more sleek and a
little bit curly er I will do the
sections where I'll start from the
bottom and work my way off so as you can
see I'm just kind of pulling pieces and
just wrapping
so I recently started reading the book
called surrender experiment by the same
author as the untethered soul which I
had mentioned to guys a couple I don't
know maybe like two years ago it's so
good so far and I feel like whenever I'm
going through something I tend to read
more than when I'm not and makes me
remember how much I missed reading so if
you guys are looking for a really good
book
check out the surrender experiment if
you haven't read untethered soul I
recommend reading that one first and
then reading this one after for all of
my spiritual gals and guys out there
that are just looking for some look at
the answers maybe some clarity hard to
explain but it's so good and I
definitely recommend it we do the same
thing on the other side
next I'm just using my Moroccan sea salt
spray to add some texture to my hair I'm
going to do a little fishtail braid I
don't know what side I want to do it on
I think I'm going to do it on this side
and have it hang yeah so what I'm going
to do is just part my hair and then I'm
going to take this chunk of hair right
here and do a little fishtail braid so
for those of you who don't know how to
do a fishtail braid what you're going to
want to do is section your hair into two
sections what I'm going to do first is
take a piece from the front of the
section one and pull it over to section
two then we're going to take a piece
from section two cross it over to
section one and you're just going to
repeat that same step take one from one
move it to two vice versa
as you get to the bottom part you can
want to do smaller pieces because it is
a thin piece of hair so normally if you
have a thicker piece of hair you'll
notice it more but if you do smaller
pieces you'll see the fishtail it will
look a little bit nicer there's been a
little fly flying on my room for days
it's like a little fruit fly and I can't
get them out and I keep seeing him fly
by the lights sweat these bugs are
haunting my legs then with a small
elastic I'm going to secure the bottom
and I'm going to slowly start stretching
it out and I like it messy so you can
just kind of work at it until it's as
thick as you want it and until it looks
just how you want
you
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I will try my
best to get up another video before this
weekend's if not I will be posting my
birthday look for sure so stay tuned for
that and thank you all for being so
patient I know it's been an annoying
couple of weeks especially with my
palate I love you guys so much again you
are everything to me and I hope you
enjoyed this video and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
