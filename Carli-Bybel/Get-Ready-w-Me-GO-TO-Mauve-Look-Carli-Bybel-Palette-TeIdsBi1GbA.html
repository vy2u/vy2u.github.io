missed you guys thank you for being
patient
last week was such a crazy week for me
with Fashion Week and all that I was in
and out of New York basically three or
four days out of the week and if you
guys have never been to New York there
is insane traffic at all times the day
so it was just a very time-consuming
week but I am back today with my go-to
look that I have done for the past
couple of months ever since I finally
had my palette put together I feel like
it's an amazing neutral look that looks
great with a bunch of different outfits
so I wanted to share it with you guys
because I've seen a lot of requests and
I also saw some requests for more looks
with my Carli bybel palette I also
wanted to let you guys know that it will
be back and stuck hopefully really
really soon they're working their
absolute best to get as many palettes
delivered as possible I know they did
place a huge order so I will keep you
guys posted as of right now I don't have
an exact date but thank you all for
being so patient I know it's very
stressful and quite annoying that it is
taking this long but good things come to
those who wait so I hope you guys enjoy
this look and if you want to learn how I
got it please keep watching to start off
this look I am priming my face with dr.
brandt pores no more this one has been
my favorite as of lately I'm just
putting a little on my fingers and then
I'm gonna slowly apply it on my face and
a downwards motion and the reason that
I'm doing that is because the hairs on
your face you want the primer to push it
all down so it gives you a lot smoother
of a finish I saw um someone had said
that you're supposed to do it in an
upwards motion and I just wanted to
clarify why I like to do it in the
downwards motion I figure today I would
film a chitchat get ready with me
because it's been a little bit since I
posted and I wanted to just maybe update
you guys and talk to you because it's
been a while and I missed you so far
foundation I am mixing the co Gendo and
143 with the cover FX custom cover drops
in n40
these two Roush actually used on me for
her seminar and I just absolutely loved
the finish that it gave so I went out
obviously to buy it and it's really cool
because these custom cover drops when I
was first going to Sephora I kept
looking and looking and looking I'm only
putting them like two jobs so I've heard
about these custom drops for a while now
I went into a couple of different stores
and I tried getting it a couple times
and I just had a lot of trouble finding
what shade that I needed because in the
store they all looked just super super
dark so she used them on me I don't know
if these were the exact colors that she
used but I realized that they're just
pure pigment to really bring out your
foundation to give you a little bit more
of fuller coverage so if the color isn't
perfect you don't have to worry so yeah
the way that the cover FX works they
have like neutral golden and then pink
so I think these ones are the neutral
yeah
neutral one so I have a little bit of a
spray tan left it's basically gone on my
face because I've been exfoliating and
stuff um but my chest looks horrible I
got a go and exfoliate in the shower so
if you could see it which I don't think
you can don't mind it so I posted my
closet tour I think two days ago now it
literally took me over a year to set
that up
mostly because I wasn't like a main
priority because I knew that we weren't
going to be here that long when we first
moved here Wow when we first moved here
we figured maybe we'll rent for a year
see how we like the area and then maybe
we would end up buying place wherein but
over the past year there's just been a
couple things that we would haven't been
too happy about about this place so we
figured it'd be best to start looking
for a house we've been looking the past
six months and um there's been a few
things that we've liked but it's just
I've been all over the place because
obviously it's a huge decision you just
want to make sure you're making the
right one so that's really the update
with that I know my closet is very
overwhelming and it's organized chaos I
just wanted to let you guys know cuz
obviously it's a lot since I have my
fashion blog and
I do my YouTube videos and stuff like
that I'm so lucky because a lot of
people will send me stuff for free so I
would say about 90% of the jewelry that
you saw in the closet where were
actually sent to me for free which is
amazing so I just don't like guys no yes
I have a crazy shopping problem but it
doesn't help that a lot of companies
send me stuff for free so it kind of
just adds to all the chaos I did mention
that I had sold some stuff on eBay I
only sold about half of the stuff that I
wanted to sell so I have a lot more
coming it's just a lot of work and it's
very time consuming so I've had Brett's
brother helping me a little bit so we'll
be getting a lot more stuff up to sell
for you guys and I will be donating 50%
of every sale to a charity I haven't
picked one charity yet but what I'm
hoping for is that it'll make enough
money that I can kind of separate and
donate to a couple different charities
so as usual if you guys have any
suggestions I have a bunch written down
that I am very interested in but I love
hearing your suggestions and just
hearing what you guys think that I
should do also I wanted to let us know
that I do donate a ton of my stuff as
well that I wouldn't even bother selling
so yes I have a ton of everything but I
will be giving back and I have been
getting back so that's really important
as well so I just wanted to fill you in
on that in case anybody was wondering
because it is a lot and I am aware
believe me I'm aware so a couple days
ago my sister adopted two little baby
kitties um they were found like on the
side of a street somewhere and she ended
up adopting them because they were both
brothers so it's so funny because I
think I told you guys when I was
babysitting my mom's cat Oliver when she
was away my sister's boyfriend he's not
allergic to cats but he doesn't he
didn't really like cats so he didn't
really want Oliver staying with him so I
ended up keeping even though I'm
allergic I ended up keeping Oliver for a
few days so I thought it was so funny I
was like how in the world Amanda did you
manage to get your boyfriend to approve
of two cats now living with you so I
just think it's so funny how he changed
his mind but they love them and they're
the cutest little babies ever I haven't
met them yet but I've seen videos and
pictures and I just can't wait to meet
them what we were thinking of doing was
getting two kitties as well because I
feel like one kitty is just mean
so as soon as we move that's like the
number one thing on my list to the
babies running around are you guys cat
people or dog people comment and let me
know I've always wanted a dog like I
used to cry and beg my mom for a dog
when I was younger I just always been
deathly allergic to all types of animals
which is just so sad but the reason that
I feel like I can have a cat now is
because when I did babysit my mom's cat
I was actually okay I think it was
because he was ground and he was Kip
nice and clean so I just feel like as
long as they're kept clean there should
be no issues it's actually really hard
to talk well doing makeup I feel like my
makeup always comes out better when I'm
not filming so in a way
so I wanted to thank everybody who came
out to the seminar last week with Haru
she was actually a week ago today was so
much fun getting to meet you guys
I still want her to people a little
upset that the meet-and-greet wasn't a
little longer but I just want to let you
guys know that it wasn't really my event
it was mostly hers and I was kind of
just her model obviously if I ever hold
an event and it's a meet-up
I will make sure I can spend enough time
with all of you guys so that you don't
feel gypped but since it was her seminar
and she had to teach a class and we had
to be out of there by 4:00 it was a
little bit rushed so that was really the
main reason why it wasn't maybe a little
bit longer but it was still so amazing
getting to meet guys and I heard some
great feedback from the class I think
she's such a talented artist and getting
to hear some of her tricks even for
myself it's awesome I feel like there's
always room for improvement there's
always room to grow and it's awesome
getting to share tricks with different
makeup artists like I actually taught
her something which was fun so it was
just a really overall like successful
experience in my opinion so thank you to
everyone who came I always thought it'd
be cool if I could do like a live
seminar like just me teaching makeup it
do it like a live makeup tutorial um
I've been thinking that ever since I did
her first class with her because I just
really could be a really cool way to get
to meet all of you guys and then do like
a live tutorial that way you guys can
actually meet me and you do it in person
and get to interact and I can kind of
walk through and see you guys doing your
own makeup and give you guys tips and
tricks so let me know what you think of
that because I feel like that could be
something really fun to set my under
eyes I'm using the Ben Nye Cameo powder
I only like to use this when I'm going
out since we are going on a little date
tonight I figured why not without the
heavy powder
I feel like this powder is definitely
good for a more dramatic look since it
is a little bit thicker I just started
doing new technique with powder I used
to use a little powder puff now I've
just been getting rid of all the creases
under my eyes and then I use this brush
by Tarte it's like a flat kabuki ish
brush it doesn't have a number on it so
I just dip that into my powder
and then I just Pat it on since it has
like a flat hat it just applies so
evenly and it doesn't give you that
extra extra extra powder that baking
does so I'm literally not even looking
in a mirror right now just so you guys
can see the technique but it's so good
because it just literally goes right
into every little crevice because of the
shape and the size of it I don't even
know when I got this brush but I just
was like let me just try it see what
happens and I'm just applying this
everywhere that I highlighted and over
the nose contour as well so next we are
moving on to brows I'm using my it
cosmetics build to brown number 12 which
is the best eyebrow brush of life in my
opinion and I'm using my brow bar to go
by whitening lightening or drug
cosmetics this is the darker one and
I've tried a million powders and this
one is just the best in my opinion it
just makes your eyebrows look super
natural and it just fills them in really
nice I don't know why it's just so hard
lately for me to get my eyebrows even
there's some days where I just don't
even try and they come out so good and
then the other days it's like why do I
have cousins as eyebrows not sisters I
want the sisters so next I'm going in
with the Ella masca heroin powder which
is a great gray shade for the nose and
I'm using my Sigma small tapered
blending brush and I'm going to start
going over those lines so this is really
random but I've like mastered how to
contour my nose and what I do is I make
this like I go like this so I can see
really where the edges are of the sides
of my nose and it's literally an instant
nose job because I've never had a nose
job and I've always wanted one but I
won't get one people still think I do
it's so great though because if people
are claiming you got a nose job and you
really didn't you know your nose contour
is on fleek girl I've had so many makeup
artists do my makeup before and it's I
feel like the nose since like the center
of your face it kind of can change your
entire look and no one knows how to
contour my nose like I do so I just have
never really
so that I haven't liked it I just when
you get so used to doing your makeup one
way and then it doesn't look like that
it just you feel like it doesn't look
like so like the nose is like so
important for me and I know people are
like well why don't you just get a nose
job
you're contouring so much and you're
changing your features well because I
don't want to get plastic surgery as of
yet maybe after I've kids I'll get my
boobs done or something like that so
right now it's gonna look a little harsh
I'm gonna go back in with a different
powder and a little bit I'm gonna start
on the eyes what do you think I'm using
for my eyes today the Carli bybel
palette that has been out of stock for
years and years and years I feel like
I'm getting gray just waiting for it to
come back in stock so let's talk about
the Carli bybel palette let's talk about
some updates I talk to BH they're
supposed to be getting a huge shipment
in any day now so I know they have that
pre-order option not a pre-order option
but you can put your email in so they
can notify you when it's coming back so
if you guys are really interested in
getting it I would definitely recommend
putting your email in they're going to
send out the mass email to everyone who
signed up before they're gonna announce
it to the public or have it like public
online so if you guys do want to get it
like immediately definitely put your
email in and you guys will be the first
to get it don't worry though because
they're just gonna keep reordering them
till everyone who wants one can get one
because they were a little unprepared in
my opinion and I don't like how everyone
has to keep waiting but remember the
quote that nothing worth having comes
easy so with time this will come I
really really really love this palette I
think everybody needs one just because
of the colors it's so neutral I have a
lot of older aunts that I've been giving
them to and they've been using it
everyday it's just so great I feel like
it's so versatile for so many ages and
I'm sorry that I keep using it and some
people haven't been able to get it yet
but I promise it will be back so soon
sorry I didn't even tell you what I was
using I am using these two shades right
here and right here I mix them together
and I put them with a big fluffy brush
right into my crease today I'm showing
you my like go-to signature look this
has been my favorite look probably
you've done it like a hundred times you
guys have seen pictures and
doing it I wanted to share with you
because I've actually not posted it
online yet so yeah you're just mixing
those two purpley shades the mob colors
and they are going in your crease and
the reason that I picked these colors
over my typical Browns was I just prefer
this shade in my crease I feel like it
looks so amazing on so many different
skin tones different eye colors and I
feel like it's a great color that can
really replace your typical matte light
brown shades another reason I love it is
because everyone's natural shadows have
a little bit of a purple tone like a
purpley grayish tone so because of that
I feel like it just looks really good
and it's a great replacement for people
who kind of wanted to step away from the
Browns and they wanted to try something
different plus I feel like this mauve
color is so in this fall I created this
palette over a year ago and it's so
funny because I knew I wanted like
baldie shades and it was just about
finding the right consistency finding
the right color the right pigmentation
and when I was planning all this it was
like last summer and I didn't even think
that these colors would be great for
fall it was kind of just I wanted to
pick colors that I thought would be
great for a year round but I just feel
like this fall like these cars have been
everywhere that liquid lipsticks just
the shadows everything so I feel like it
just came time again I'm so sorry about
the weight this was not the plan they
had ordered a lot and they sold out
really quickly and I guess they weren't
expecting a massage so quick so we
proved them wrong I'm going to take the
darkest plum color mixed with the second
to darkest plum and or ma whatever and
we're gonna go underneath our lower lash
line and I've told you guys this before
but one of the main reasons I love doing
a smoky lower lash line
and kind of like making it a little bit
lower than maybe most people do is I
have like stupid little eye wrinkles
under my eyes that were never here and
they just decided to show up
and there's nothing I can do to get rid
of them by adding a nice smoky color on
the lower lash line like this it's just
gonna
camouflage those little wrinkles
wrinkles wrinkles wrinkles wrinkles so
moving on to liner I'm using the ink
liner by Kat Von D mine's a little old
and it's not as good as it was which is
annoying but what I'll do is I'll use
this one which is like the marker and
then after I've done my lashes I'll go
back in with a gel one just to really
make the black pop and to make sure
there's no like lighter spaces so for
lashes i'm using the wispy sweet
nothings pretty sure that's what they're
called from velour lashes so next i'm
just going over the liner with a black
gel liner
so now I'm just applying the Studio Fix
powder and n4 I'm just stamping it
underneath my eyes I'm just going to
brighten it up and I'm dragging this up
to the sides of where my contour is I'm
not going over the dark lines but I'm
just dragging it up to where that is and
that's going to help make my nose up
here
slimmer as well which is always a plus
so that is I think basically it for the
eyes um it's just been this look that
I've been doing literally every day
matches every outfit it just looks good
with everything and yeah it's just my
go-to look I feel like it will look good
on so many different people so I can't
wait for you guys to try it and
hopefully love it so next what I'm doing
is I'm grabbing the NC 42 on that same
brush and I'm just going to start going
over those lines putting a little bit
over the brown stamping it on basically
and it gives it a much more natural look
because it's blending in with the powder
under your eyes and it's taking away
that dark grayish
look so I'm just going back with
whatever is left on this brush over just
the thinner lines to make my nose appear
thinner again it's just a process I
think that's like the key with the nose
is like there's a lot of steps and you
want to just keep going over those same
lines so it looks as most natural as
possible so see how it kind of just
blends in nicely for bronzer I'm using
the shade and light palette the middle
shade and a little bit of that bright
shade and I'm just slowly gonna contour
just because I have my lip liner here I
don't have my blush it's over there I'm
gonna grab it in minute I'm just gonna
line my lips I'm using oak bye man I
love this lip liner because it's a good
contour color so if you want to make
your lips look bigger this is key see
the difference see how it just adds like
a sheet of shadow above your actual lip
line so it makes it look a lot bigger
than it really is so for blush I'm using
I got the new NARS Pro palette how
amazing um so I'm gonna use some of the
blushes from this one I'm gonna go with
I'm gonna go with like these two because
they're more unlike the mob side my mob
mob
however you want to say it so funny Mina
Roush had a conversation about it too
like how do you pronounce it is it mob
is it mob I don't know what do you guys
think mom laughs either way I'm grabbing
these two and I'm just gonna do circular
motions and then for lips I'm using dose
of colors and stone I think it was a
limited edition shade but it's just so
beautiful I'm gonna try to find a dude
for you guys so you could see how this
lip shade just matches the eyes so
perfectly and then back to the oak so
now this is the most important part for
the nose contour in my opinion I'm
actually going to pick up this eyeshadow
shade right here and I'm going to do a
little ball at the tip Nicole taught me
this little tip and it has changed my
life so yeah it's kind of weird at first
we're gonna put a little ball at the top
and then you're gonna just draw the line
down the center
like that and it just you see how it
makes my nose already looks so much
thinner just because the way that the
light hits it it makes it appear more
narrow
it means this brush I got this one
recently from a Nastasia and it's
honestly so good for highlighting so
just right here little on the chin here
love the brows a drop and you can see
how pigmented these highlighters are so
exciting hydrate my lips a little I'm
using the best damn beauty lip mask I
always always do this with my liquid
lipsticks so I don't get that line so
you can either use this before or after
I like it after because it leaves your
lips feeling really moisturize and not
so dry from the matte lipstick and then
last but not least I'm just setting my
face with the Mario Badescu rose water
what to do with this hand I don't know
what to do
I showered last night and this is how it
air-dried I'm just kind of blot the
front
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video as soon as I
have any other updates on my pallet and
when it will be back I will definitely
notify you guys that way you guys can
get it as soon as it's back up so thank
you all for being so patient I hope you
enjoyed this video and until next time I
will see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
