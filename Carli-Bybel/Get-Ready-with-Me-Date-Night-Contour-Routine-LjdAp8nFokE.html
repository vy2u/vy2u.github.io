now I'm not gonna make you feel loved if
you don't I would rather learn what it
feels like to burn and feel nothing at
all oh I used to treat you sweetly I
would pull you to my chest as you cried
about feels they've been quickly through
your hands he was searching for one
grain of sand along and in this Beach as
I was building hi everybody thank you
for watching tonight me and Brett are
going out to dinner so I decided to film
myself getting ready so if you want to
see my getting ready process please keep
watching on a slowly shattering what do
I say
make you feel love it
I would rather
feels like a fun
you have faded my reality like a Eve
that turn to dust fell asleep inside a
fantasy then woke up feeling lost now
I'm terrified and restless but I just
cannot escape I wish you had words this
that is killing me what do I say what do
I do to show you all the ways my heart
is slow
chattering
I see
what do i to
ok so it's been quite some time since
I've done an updated contour highlight
video so I'm going to talk you guys
through this section the first thing you
always want to do before you contour and
highlight your face is you want to
determine what type of face shape that
you have so you know where to apply the
darker shades and where to apply the
highlight shades for this look I'm using
the shade and light palette by Kat Von D
it's the new contour and highlight kit
that you can get at Sephora and this kit
is amazing it's definitely one of my
favorites the colors I'm going to be
using today are sombre and shadow apply
and then to set the highlighted area I'm
going to be using the color lyric which
is a yellow tone for me I have a large
forehead so I'm going to be contouring a
lot all around my forehead area I'm also
going to be doing my cheekbones
underneath my jawline and of course my
nose so the first shade that I'm going
to be using is the color shadow play and
this I'm going to be using as a bronzer
to kind of bronze up my face a bit
before I go in with the more gray tone
to contour for this look I am using the
double sided shade and light brush also
by Kat Von D 2 bronze I'm going to be
using this side right here taking a
little bit on my brush and I'm gonna
start applying it on my face starting
with my cheeks I like to do small
circular motions and I press very light
on the skin because we don't want too
much product in one area we want to give
it a really nice bronzy look so again
I'm using this first shade to kind of
bronze up my face so if you guys have a
smaller forehead you don't need a
contour as much on your forehead if at
all the key to contour and highlight is
to really accentuate your features and
to kind of change your features a little
bit so again if you have a smaller
forehead you can skip this step or just
do right along the hairline but for me
since I have a nice big forehead I'm
going to be going from about the side of
my eyebrow up and then just all around
you could already see before I did this
side you can already see just by adding
a little bit of bronzer it kind of
shrinks it a bit so again I'm using a
very light hand to apply this and I'm
doing little circular motions
you don't want to forget to do the sides
right on your temples as well
so for my jawline I'm going to do it
right underneath my jaw if you guys have
a larger chin or a larger jaw you can
make the line up a little bit higher to
kind of cut it off a bit but I feel like
I have kind of like a weak a weaker chin
so it's a little bit smaller and I want
to balance it out with my forehead so
I'm going to be doing it right
underneath of course we will know make
sure we bring it down on our neck so our
neck matches our face it's like the one
rule for makeup is to make sure blends
nice and it doesn't look like you're
wearing a mask of course I really love
this color for a bronzer some other kits
that they sell out there they don't
really have a mixture between cool and
warmer tones so one of the main reasons
that I love this is you could bronze you
can contour and you can set your
highlighter all with this one kit so
it's not like you're going to be not
using all the shades in the kit the
darkest shade I would definitely use to
contour when I had a tan um so with
spring and summer coming up hopefully
I'll be a little bit tanner and I will
go in with that darker shade but since
my skin is super super light I'm not
going to be using that today okay so now
I'm going in with the color somber you
can see this is a more grayish tone
shade this color is really going to
accentuate your contours so I'm using
that same side of the brush dipping it
in and I'm not going to be applying it
all over like I did the bronzer I'm
going to be applying it right where the
line is and then you're going to slowly
blend it up just a little bit let's see
how it really accentuates the cheekbone
taking a little bit more and I'm
applying it right along my hairline and
then again right along my jaw so to
contour my nose I'm grabbing this sheet
again with a smaller tapered blending
brush and I'm going to squeeze it
together and just go right down the
sides of my nose
whenever I'm contouring my nose I always
like to bring it up towards my eyebrow
and then blend it so that way when I do
my eye shadow it's all going to blend
together and it's not just going to look
like two random lines so next we're
going to pick up the color lyric with
the opposite side of the brush and we're
going to apply that on all the areas
that I had highlighted with the
concealer I already basically set my
under eyes with the Laura Mercier powder
but this powder is going to really
highlight it and really bring it forward
so with just one swipe of my brush you
can already see how much more
highlighted this side is versus this
side so I really really love this powder
one thing that I always noticed was with
a lot of highlight and contour kits
besides this one the highlighter shades
they were good but I just never use them
because they weren't they didn't have a
full enough coverage like it just went
on and it kind of didn't look like any
different so this I love because it
comes out super pigmented so you really
just need a little bit to set it I'm
gonna play a little bit right here on
the bridge of my nose and then on my
chin and then very lightly I'm just
gonna slow they bit end it all in so I
just wanted to leave this part in normal
speed to kind of give you guys a little
update on a highlight contour routine
using just the powders so now we're
going to move on to eyes I'm probably
not going to talk through since I do so
many talk throughs on my eyes this is
actually going to be the eye shadow look
that I posted when I was back in Tampa
it was what I wore for a night out there
and I saw a lot of people requesting the
same look so moving on to the eye
it's tell afford shoes and soles of your
feet I've got the stars from running
I'm beaches and streets I've been locked
down now I've got eyes black and blue
cuz I'm hit in the faith when I'm
talking to you know goes lie down as
soon as I sleep you'll be leaving this
town down
some loss
I've got my mind
and then file all asleep
even is
it's
you see I've got
and I've never been
but you sway or just stubborn
ah down
as
you'll be leaving this I don't wanna
hold you if you wanna go now I'm not
gonna make you feel loved if you don't I
would rather learn what it feels like to
burn and feel nothing at all oh I used
to treat you sweetly I would pull you to
my chest as you cried about the ocean
slipping quickly through your hands he
was searching for one grain of sand
along an endless beach as I was building
you a castle that you just refused to
see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
