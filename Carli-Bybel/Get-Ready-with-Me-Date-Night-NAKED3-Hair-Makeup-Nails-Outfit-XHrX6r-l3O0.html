today's get ready with me video is
inspired by this new clutch that Brett
bought for me I love rose gold I think
the color is so beautiful so I gathered
a few my favorite rose gold items and
these were my inspiration so if you guys
want to get ready with me please keep
watching so I have a date tonight with
Brett and I wanted to take you guys with
me while I get ready I saw a lot of you
guys concern about this mark on my neck
that it is just a burn I burned myself
with my curling iron so first step is
obviously neosporin I am going to be
priming my face with my favorite
Smashbox primer and then following that
I'm going to be applying my foundation
to fill in my brows I'm using the brow
gel from anastasia beverly hills and
this is a new product that i've been
using and I really love the consistency
and I love how it makes your brows look
you
I'm going to be contouring my face so
I'm starting off with my nose I'm using
a brown I'm using a brown color and this
is going to be a cream contour so first
I am just outlining my nose following
that I will be doing my cheeks the sides
of my face underneath my jaw and I'm
going to be planning it all
to start off this look I'm using this
nude eyeshadow base from Sigma and I'm
just applying that all over my lids and
this is going to help the eyeshadow
stick to it since I am using shimmery
colors I do like to apply either a base
or concealer on my eye so my theme for
this video was the color rose gold and
I've seen a ton of you guys requesting a
Naked 3 palette tutorial so I figured
why not try it out the pad is indeed
rose gold and they do have a few really
pretty colors in it so all over my lid
I'm mixing the color trick along with
the color dust and this is going to give
you a really pretty coppery shimmery
look so with my blending brush I'm
picking up the purpley matte color
called nooner and I'm applying this
right in the crease of my eye
using my smaller blending brush I'm then
picking up the color dark side and I'm
going to be applying that right in my
outer V and this is just going to give
my eyes some more depth and it's going
to give it a smoky or more dramatic look
next up we're going to be applying false
lashes these ones are by velour and
before I apply them I'm just going to be
applying a little bit of mascara that
way I can use just a tiny bit of mascara
once I actually get the lashes on so
once you got those bad boys on don't
forget to apply a little bit more
mascara that way your natural lashes
blend into the false lashes so I was
originally going to skip the eye liner
but then when I had applied the lashes
it seems a little bit too dramatic so I
knew a liner would balance out the look
so I'm just applying a black gel liner
all over my upper lash line then
following that I'm applying my mascara
on my lower lashes with a small angled
brush and the color dust I'm going to be
applying some of that shadow on my lower
lash line and then grabbing the darker
color dark side I'm lining the outer
part of my lash line blending that into
the lighter color so now that we
finished the eyes let's move on to
concealer I'm just applying that with my
Beauty Blender underneath my eyes also
on the bridge of my nose and anywhere
else you want to highlight
you
the most important thing to do is grab
your foundation brush and just blend
everything in really nicely to give it
that beautiful faded look so for my lips
I'm going with a rose gold look as well
I'm using my tawny lip liner by Jordana
and then following that I'm using pure
Zen by Mac
next I'm highlighting my Cupid's bow
with the color dust and then to
highlight my cheeks I'm using by Revlon
it's called pink light
to top off this look I'm using my NARS
blush and there you have it this is my
rose gold inspired makeup look for my
date tonight
as I was recording this I couldn't help
but notice how chipped my manicure was
so it's definitely now time to do my
nails
this is hands-down the easiest way to
remove your nail polish all you do is
just stick your finger in swirl it
around and then all of your nail polish
comes off since I don't have any legit
rose color for my nails I figured I
would go with this light peachy color
and then apply a shimmery coat on top
and then I figured it would give it the
closest thing to a rose gold manicure
one of my little tricks between each
coat is to use my blow-dryer so it dries
a lot quicker so with each hand I did
two coats of the peach colored and then
I just did one coat of the sparkly color
over that so moving on to hair it is
time to wash my hair so instead of
washing it let's do a ponytail that's
what I always do I always the day I know
I need to wash it I'll do either a bun
or a ponytail and then just wait an
extra day just because I'm a lazy and my
hair takes forever so I'm doing a
ponytail look with my extensions I have
any more in-depth tutorial if you guys
want to see that I will link it below
but I'm just doing a little pony to wrap
around my extensions and then you will
see how it all turns out
so once your hair is secured and nice
and tight there probably will be at
least one or two bump so you can just
fasten those down with some bobby pins
then I just use my hair spray some of it
all back and I'm all done with my hair
so now let's move on to my outfit so
since I had all my jewelry and
everything planned out beforehand I knew
I wanted to do something which would
incorporate a light pink so I ended up
picking out these pink trousers and I
pair them with a pair of nude Louboutins
that I love they're just not so
comfortable I must say and I also paired
it with this beige top because it had
this nude underlying lace underneath it
so I love this look if you guys want to
see more details and more pictures of
this outfit definitely go check out my
blog I will list everything with the
links below thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed this video
now I'm gonna go head out the door and
go for a date with Brett I love you guys
and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
