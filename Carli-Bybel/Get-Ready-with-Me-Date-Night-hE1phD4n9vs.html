instead of stays with you
all eyes where you stand
it's been a long you
catching trains here
I wear
hi everyone thank you for watching so
last night I went out to dinner with
Brett and some friends so I decided to
film myself getting ready now today of
course I sound a little bit sick I'm
stuffy so I do apologize but I just
wanted to basically show you guys how I
did my hair makeup for dinner I wanted
to recreate that makeup look that I
posted a couple days ago because I saw a
bunch of people asking for the tutorial
so this is the makeup tutorial for that
I'm starting out with my Smashbox primer
I'm applying it all over my face and
this is basically empty so I think maybe
to go invest in a new one
but I'm just applying this on my face
with my fingers next up I'm using this
Orange
slash salmon color concealer from NYX or
NYX however you say it I just picked
this up today so it was my first time
using it but what I've been doing lately
is applying a salmon color concealer
underneath my foundation this is going
to help really cancel out and dark under
eyes as you can see my eye looks already
so much brighter by just doing this one
simple step so if you guys have some
dark circles I recommend trying this out
because again it is a new trick that I
started doing and I think it really does
help make your face look even
with a damp Beauty Blender and a little
bit of my Chanel foundation I'm going to
be applying this all over my face I
basically use one pump for each side of
my face and that's always enough and
again use your Beauty Blender damp
because I made the mistake of trying it
dry and I just never liked it but when
it's damp it really gives you a
beautiful flawless finish
sometimes songs
moving on to eyebrows I'm just using
this double-sided brush I'm going to
comb them up and then I'm filling them
in with my brow bar to go in the darker
shade
but that's cream
you're using that same brown shade that
I use for my eyebrows I'm applying this
right on to my nose to contour it with
this lip brush actually but I personally
like this to contour it's going to seem
really dark at first but I like to do it
dark and then smudge in with my fingers
and then basically throw out the look
I'll always be smudging it out blending
it out to really give it a perfect
finish
since I forgot before I'm now applying a
clear brow gel right onto my brows and
this is going to hold them in place
I'm applying the color rose pigment by
Mac all over my eyelids first and again
I was originally just gonna leave it
that one color and then once I kind of
finished the look I ended up putting the
tan pigment right over that and it gives
it a really pretty cranberry beige /
bronze color and I actually really like
how it looks layered so that is how I'm
going to be doing it again
you don't really need too much product
with the shadows because they are super
pigmented so again I'm just blending
them right into my crease and up towards
my brows to give it a nice blended look
in Arkansas
just say
so I'm applying the Mack 35 lashes and
I'm using the new velour lash glue and
it's actually really really great it's
this black color and they come in these
sticks so they're really easy to bring
with you
next up by Sigma I'm using the gel liner
in the color wicked and I'm also using
their new eyeliner brush
daydreams
you're
so I started to apply a little bit of
the tan pigment under my eye and then I
realized I didn't apply my concealer
that I wanted over it so I'm using the
Laura Mercier and sc2 and with my damp
Beauty Blender I'm just applying a
little bit more underneath my eyes to
really highlight and brighten up my face
I'm also applying it on the bridge of my
nose and in between the eyebrows and I
apologize again that I sound like a
complete stuffy mess
moving on to contour I'm using the
anastacio kit and I'm applying this
brown shadow all over my face where I
want to contour it's okay if you see
some harsh lines I'm going to go back
with a clean foundation brush and just
blend it all out
so going back to that tan Pegman and my
pencil brush I'm just applying this
underneath my eyes and I'm dragging it
out to the middle part of my eye and
then I'm taking that darker brown shade
from the Too Faced palette and I'm
applying it right on the outer part of
my eye blending it into the lighter
shade for lips i'm using the color oak
lip liner by Mac and then over that I'm
using this new wet and wild lipstick I
believe it's 9:02 I will list everything
on my blog as usual but I'm just going
back to my lip liner and just shading it
in so it blends really nicely and that's
what you give it that really cool nude
color that I've been wearing in my past
few pictures
okay so now moving on to hair I would
say this is PI like day two or three
since I've washed it so this new
hairstyle I've been doing a lot lately
and I saw some people asking how I do
and so basically tie my hair down I part
it where I want to part it and then with
some hairspray and the smoothing brush I
just really smooth the hair behind my
ear as if I were doing that low ponytail
that I showed you not too long ago so
again just some hairspray smooth it down
and it tells us smooth as you want it
just I guess keep spraying it I'm going
to use a little bit of that clear brow
gel that it's from my beauty tricks for
my last video and I'm just going to
smooth out any of the loose flyaways
right around my face so that is how I do
the hairstyle you can either leave the
hair on the front or put it in the back
and for those of you wondering I'm not
wearing hair extensions in this video
it's just finally getting long but for
my outfit I've had this plan for a while
now I kind of plan our outfits and then
hang them together
these look like matching separates but I
actually got them from two different
stores
I love the new menswear trend that is
going on I also love the whole buttoning
it from the bottom off to kind of show
off your belly a little bit but I paired
it with this beautiful necklace from
ASOS some white ankle jewelry and these
amazing Gucci pumps that I got last year
so all outfit details and more pictures
will be on my blog so if you want to see
more go check it out thank you guys so
much for watching and until next time
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
