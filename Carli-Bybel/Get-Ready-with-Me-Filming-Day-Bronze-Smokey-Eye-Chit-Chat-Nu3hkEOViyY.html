today I decided to film myself getting
ready I am filming a fashion haul today
what you guys probably already saw by
now today I figured I would do a get
ready with me video because I had to get
ready regardless for the fashion haul so
for this video I'm not going to do it
like my normal get ready with me video
I'm just going to kind of just talk to
you guys and tell you some updates in my
life as I get ready so if you guys want
to know everything I'm using I will list
every product down in the description
bar as I use it yesterday I had my first
mrs. EO is my first live interview
experience um I know a lot of you guys
probably already saw that I was in
People magazine last week I was there
people pick of the week which was
awesome it's funny because I don't even
know that they were going to be picking
me I only found out because people
started tweeting me the picture which
was so funny so um it was really
exciting but once I was in people I had
the people I had the people from people
reach out to me and asked me to come on
their live show which is people now on
people calm so anyway the people from
People magazine they reached out to me
and they asked me to come on their show
to do an interview and then to do like a
little segment um about like wedding
season and prom season that's coming up
so I went in and it was a live show and
I was super nervous um one of my biggest
fears is public speaking and I know
that's how it might sound crazy and I
know some of you guys are gonna be like
will you do this for a living you sit
and you talk to millions of people and
that's what you do but I always have to
explain this because people never
understand my fear is when I film videos
I'm alone majority the time Brett's not
even home so it's not like I'm sitting
here talking to a bunch of people I'm
just kind of
talking to a camera and then I
eventually post it online so I don't
know I've just always had this problem
it's like a severe phobia like even in
high school when we would have to go up
and like share project or share
something I would literally start
sweating I would shake like this and
yeah it just always been not a good
experience for me so going into it I was
definitely really really nervous so we
had a car pick us up and we stopped at a
Starbucks by my house on the way in and
probably a bad decision because nerves
plus caffeine is never a good mix so
I've had about three sips of it and I
was just like this freaking out and I
know it shouldn't be freaking out like
right kept saying like it's not a huge
deal it's not like it's live television
like bla bla bla bla bla but I don't
know just something inside of my head
like I'm just I don't know I've always
just had such problems and I think one
of the reasons that I have so many
public speaking problems which it's
really silly story actually but when I
was younger I did singing lessons and we
would have like um singing recitals at
the end of the year
and I think it was probably my first
recital maybe like second recital that I
ever did and when I went up I was so
nervous and my voice cracked a little
bit and there was like a front row of
like all these young kids and everybody
started laughing at me
so I just I know it's like so little and
it's so long ago I was probably like 7
or 8 years old but it stuck with me and
it really scarred me ever since I just
had such a fear and it's definitely
affected me later in life so I think
they have like hypnosis and like they
have all different kinds of things I'm
pretty sure that you can like do to get
over this fear so I'm going to look into
it I don't know if you guys have heard
of Tony Robbins if you guys have seen
Shallow Hal he was the one with big
hands he was really tall he was one that
actually made Hal see people for their
beauty inside and outside so I'm
actually going to one of his seminars
over the summer he has like a
a three-day seminar where it's like 12
hours a day and apparently it's really
life-changing so I'm excited for that
but back to the People magazine so um
when I got there I they like read over
like a script they had like a script
written that they wanted me to say and
immediately I was like well I am NOT
going to be reading off the script
because whenever I have to read off
something or when someone tells me what
I need to say like that just is a huge
problem for me it makes me ten times
more nervous because I just like to talk
and say what I want to say and share
what I want to share because it's not
like I'm free like I'm not premeditating
what I'm going to say in my head so I
ask them I'm like is it okay like if I
don't read off the script and kind of
just go with what I want to say and
they're like yeah totally like we only
have it here to help you and blah blah
blah so um I kind of just want it is
that a word wrong it yeah that's a word
kind of just one it yeah um so the first
part was an interview and I'll link it
if you guys want to go check it out they
just asked me a couple questions which
I'm always usually okay with interviews
because they're just asking me questions
about like how I started and Goudy got
and like for me this is like the one
thing in life where I could sit down and
talk about it all day every day because
I'm just so happy in my career and I'm
just so happy where everything's been
going so that part was like a piece of
cake but then um afterwards I had to do
like a talk to camera part where I was
alone and I had to just talk about some
tricks for wedding and prom season so
sorry it's kind of hard to like talk and
tell a story while I'm trying to
concentrate into my makeup so I ramble I
apologize but I never really did it get
ready with me where I just sat here and
talk to you guys and um
I figured I'd try it out if you guys
don't like this type of video you can
let me know and I won't do it again
but um yeah just
to chat with you guys so yeah so I did
the second segment and thank God I
brought props with me because it kind of
almost felt like I was just making a
video for you guys and like just sharing
some like tips and tricks that I would
actually share with you on camera so it
did go I guess pretty well as I was
holding up each product though I was
shaking so much I was so nervous and a
good thing I went to watch it back you
couldn't really tell that I was shaking
so I'm sure some people reply like oh
you did a great job but like in my head
I was just like oh my god it was
probably one of the scariest things I've
ever done and I don't know if I will
ever do it again like the thought of
live anything where I don't have like
control over the situation it just
scares me so how you like that's totally
like this but I survived it went really
well
and iguana Munich they want me to come
back which I'm not sure if I would go
back not because I didn't have a good
time but again it's just I don't know I
have some severe issues that I need to
deal with because I'm just I feel like I
won't ever really be myself in those
situations because my nerves take over
and I have like a mini anxiety attack so
it was definitely outside of my comfort
zone I'm glad that I did it um yeah I
mean it's just really I felt very
honored that they even wanted me there
so it was a definitely a really cool
experience so that was yesterday and
that was was definitely one of the most
nerve-wracking things I've done to date
and um when I was talking my mom about
it she was like I don't understand like
this is what you do for a living like
you have your meet ups and you have like
hundreds of people that come in you sit
there and you're so good with everybody
and I'm like well it's so different
because when I haven't meet up with you
guys it's like I get one-on-one time
with you I'm not focusing on the crowd
of people that are watching I'm just
having like a one-on-one conversation
which I could do all day every day like
I
talking you guys I don't know to me
that's not anything that's nerve-racking
it's just the thought of being somewhere
knowing there's like a lot of eyes on
you and just in a comfortable situation
so that was that we recently just got a
new job from my grandma it was her
birthday and um she was feeling lonely
so we got her a cute little rescue puppy
from the shelter and he's so cute I've
only seen pictures I haven't gone over
on to see him but I'm probably gonna go
either today or tomorrow to go see him
but I'm so excited because it sucks I
know I've said it in a couple of videos
I have like the worst allergies of life
large - literally everything every
animal every fruit basically which I
still eat fruit just allergic to
everything we wanted an animal for so
long the way I see it is it wouldn't be
fair if you got an animal and you
weren't able to cut out with them at
night and sleep with them every night so
I don't know I think that's the biggest
reason I just I don't want to live my
life sneezing itchy and being miserable
because I can't breathe so it's always
nice to just go and visit and I could
take a benadryl and then I'll be fine
but yeah I mean I don't know like I know
they have like shots they say that can
take away your allergies I don't know I
guess maybe I should look into it a
little further before I come to the
conclusion that I can just never get an
animal because I don't know I feel like
everybody needs an animal I feel like
you're empty without it so we shall sing
you never know but it's funny because I
don't know this is like a true thing I'm
pretty sure I looked it up and it's what
I saw is that every 7 years like your
allergies change or like your body
changes or something like that and it's
funny because my whole life I was
allergic to bananas and strawberries and
just basically every single fruit like I
would never really ever eat fruit like
apples and now I can eat bananas so no
problem I have one almost every day I
love bananas what else can I have
that I wasn't able to have before you
know I can't think all the time I had
strawberries
I'm better with it really just a pen so
I don't know if it's because we started
shopping all organic and maybe I was
allergic to the pesticides or maybe it's
just my it's sure that your body maybe
changes and what you were always
allergic to you aren't allergic to any
more so I don't know if any of you guys
know if that's true or not let me know
because I mean is exciting I used to I
used to just do it anyway like I would
go horseback riding and I would
literally leave there a hot mess from
sneezing okay is it garbage coming today
oh it is I don't know something's just
gonna make sacrifices for if you really
love something we got to do it so I mean
I was a horseback rider I feel like that
it's so fun I'm just like Ram I'm like
telling you guys like the most random
things but um I those of you guys that
maybe don't know I was a horseback rider
for like seven years I love horses and
it's funny because Brett said today he's
like I'm gonna buy you a horse
one day Morgan put it in our yard and I
was like yeah that'd be so much fun I
really like I'm so obsessed with horses
I want to take Brett and horseback
riding with me me my dad used to go
trail riding every weekends basically
and I also took lessons for like seven
years as I said and there's so many good
times so the garbage drives right
outside my window right now so I'll just
be quiet for a second
like if I talk
I don't even know what I was talking
about I apologize I only got one video
up for you guys last week I don't
remember what I was doing last week but
every time that I went to go film like
something else came up so um I also had
a wedding on Saturday was one of one of
my oldest family friends and I did the
makeup for her I did my sister and then
I did my mom so it was just a really
hectic week for me so I do apologize
Thursday I'm leaving for LA I'm going to
like Thursday to Monday Monday we're
taking the red-eye home so I'll be home
technically Tuesday morning I've seen a
lot of people requesting I mean forever
now years now because I've already been
to different homes um that you guys want
to see a house tour and all that stuff
and we've been renting this place that
we're in right now um we did a one-year
lease so August was when we got the
place and when we moved in and um
originally we were like okay well we
love it here let's think about buying it
but I'm not sure if that's going to be
the case so that's the only reason I
really haven't done so even a house tour
because I just feel like I haven't
finished decorating because I just
haven't been sure if we were going to
stay here and one thing I learned last
time around where's my brow bar I went
not all out and fully decorated my last
place but I definitely put a lot of
energy into getting a place looking nice
and buying all kinds of furniture and
then when we moved into this place oh
the walls were different colors the
whole color schemes were different so I
had to buy a lot of new things and I did
buy like a new couch and like a few like
a new bed set which I could bring
anywhere but I didn't really fully
decorate because I wanted to make sure
we were going to actually
stay here this time because a lot of the
stuff that I brought over from my old
house I ended up having to put into
storage I'm planning on going my
interview later so we're planning on
looking soon so if we decide to stay
here which I don't think we will
I will finish decorating and I will get
you guys a little house towards it's not
a house it's a townhouse so they are
attached to the other ones that's
another thing to add on to the to-do
list is
find a place to live for us it was a
good idea to rent in the beginning we
used to our old place I actually um got
one thing about it was like January of
2013 yeah definitely 2013 I moved out of
my mom's house and I literally moved in
the same development like right around
the block into my own place and that was
around the time that me and Brett
started dating so he ended up moving in
and I think if I would have known ahead
of time that we were gonna be living
together I probably may have gone
something a little bit bigger just
because it was a perfect size for just
me I have a lot of stuff and I think
when he moved in he kind of had like no
space and it was just it was very
cluttered so we were there almost two
years like almost two years and then we
found this place and we've been so back
and forth on where we want to live like
we didn't want to buy because we don't
know what part of New Jersey we want to
stay in it made so much sense just to
rent until we figured out where we
wanted to be and now I just feel like
renting is basically just a waste of
money at this point because you spend
all this money and then at the end of
the year you don't really have anything
so for us we know like yes we're not
married yet but we talk about it all the
time and I know that me and I might
spend the rest of our lives together so
I think for us it's time that we start
looking at maybe like a smaller house or
something like that just to buy to have
um so we have something so weird we're
like real grownups it's funny how time
flies
that's for sure also I don't know if you
guys saw on my Instagram
I you can see like the walls behind me
I'm going to show you guys a close-up in
a second um I recently just did the
tempeh / which is temporary wallpaper my
mom actually works for the company and
they had just come out with this amazing
new print which is the white on white
lace so I of course wanted to add it to
my walls in here I'm so happy with how
it came out with I'm so happy with how
it came out you can do it yourself
all you do is it's like a big giant
sticker for your wall so it is gonna
take you a couple hours because you want
to make sure everything's all lined up
and looking even but I absolutely love
it if you guys are in college I think
it's great for like dorm rooms cuz it's
temporary so if you're renting like we
are it's a way to cover up the walls
without permanently changing the color
we did the white on white lace in this
room and then I did the damask print
downstairs which I think I mentioned in
one of my favorites videos so I will
list the details below if anyone wants
to go check it out feel like my makeups
gonna take so much longer this video
doesn't end up being like hours long so
whenever I'm not filming like a makeup
video I always tend to do a similar I
lock on I'm using the natural matte
eyeshadow collection and I'm just using
this color in this color I'll be using
after and it's just a very neutral look
that is just enough to film with so I
kind of always do the same thing so I
just figured for this video I would just
do the same filming look that I usually
always do
one of the hardest things to do while
filming is eyeliner because I'm sure you
guys have noticed that by my videos cuz
it's always I'm always trying to stay in
focus well I'll do my makeup and like
with my eyeliner I think I need to be
like this so uneven huh a struggle
struggle but I'm not filming never ever
have a problem filming wings always
uneven hi why is that do any of you guys
watch or have any of you guys watch
Breaking Bad I know it ended like a
while ago but we started watching
breaking down after New York I'm at or
the weekend that we're in New York
because um we've been talking about
either watching that or Sons of Anarchy
because nipple and Jeremy were saying
those are like the best shows me and
Brent would never we never had like
shows we he always watches football I'm
always on my computer always doing
something so like I don't mind not
having like any shows but back in
October I found that Daenerys makeup
tutorial because a lot of people were
just telling you that I looked like her
and I never watched the show before then
and I just film the video and it's funny
because I started the video like in a
forest because I never watched the show
I didn't know what the hell goes on but
I figured okay if she's the queen of
dragons she must have been a four in a
forest at some point but it was funny
because people were like this video is
great and all but I've never seen
Daenerys in a forest which I thought was
hilarious so that made me and Brett
decide hey like let's try and watch that
show so we've finished the whole season
and now it's back on which I'm not gonna
lie I am enjoying it but I hate having
to wait a whole week in between shows
like it's a frickin torture and I forget
what happens and it's just bothers me so
we've been watching Breaking Bad and I
think in like two weeks we got through
all the seasons we have one more season
left we literally watch the season
finale last night of I don't know what
are there five seasons
I think there's five seasons so if there
are five seasons we watch season four
finale
it's just so good it's it's honestly
amazing but I love that I love waiting
and then
and being able to just watch and watch
and watch and watch and not have to have
like a break in between I can't tell you
how many hours we've spent like just
laying on the couch being lazy bums but
you know what it's nice every once in a
while to just kind of take a break from
your everyday routine and just watch a
good show so if you guys have any
awesome shows that you recommend please
comment below and let me know because
I'm always looking some of the ones that
I've heard that are really good that we
plan on watching our Sons of Anarchy
Walking Dead
I heard orange is the new black is
really good so yes we just got Netflix
and it's one of the best things ever I
love how it just remembers what episode
you're on and remembers everything for
you so yay for Netflix I'm wearing my
Carlie lash today have you guys tried
them out I know I keep getting so many
amazing pictures and you guys look so
good in them
literally impossible not to get me Skara
on your face like I said before Thursday
I leave for LA and when I get back I'm
gonna do definitely another prom video
for you guys maybe too um my cousin has
blonde blonde hair so I was thinking of
bringing her in um to do like a look for
my blondes out there cuz I know it's
always me doing my own makeup which some
of you guys I know don't mind but for
the others it can be hard maybe to know
what colors would look like on you
because I have maybe different skin tone
or different coloring than you guys so
let me know how that sounds cuz I was
thinking of bringing her in as soon as I
get back to do that my little cousin
brookie she is five oh my god she's six
yeah she's six years old now which is
just not okay I've been trying to get
her to come into a video with me forever
now who want to step outside your
comfort zone
Smith hi hi my angel did you oh yeah I'm
filming a video I'm gonna show you look
oh look a camera say hi okay
why has makeup on cuz I'm filming a
YouTube video for my makeup Channel yeah
I know I miss you
so I finally think she's old enough to
come in and sit for however long it
takes hopefully it'll be quick because I
know she won't last too too long but um
I was thinking to do like a cute like
hairstyle for little girls or something
like that so let me know if you guys
like that idea because I want you guys
to just meet her because she is just my
favorite human being and I just love her
so much and
just wanna get her in on a video so
weird how quick time goes and like you
live every day and like you look back
and you're like oh yeah like Tom's past
you don't notice it but then when young
people in your lives like every time you
see them they look like different people
because they're getting so big that's
when you're like cheese like where the
heck did time go I remember when my
little cousins were just little babies I
have two Brooke and Collin Collin is
like nine or he's turning nine which is
so weird he doesn't even like me anymore
I guess it's like a stage that little
boys go through we've never had any boys
in our family so I'm not used to having
a little boy so when he was younger he
me and him were just close like this
like he would see me he'd come running
he come jumping give me kisses all that
sup and now he's just too cool and it
makes me so sad every time I see him I'm
always like hi and he'll like look at me
like this and then look away because
he's too cool i cant say hot in front of
his friends he doesn't want to be
embarrassed and yeah i mean it's just
it's very it's a setting for me because
i just want to love me it's been so cold
here in jersey the past couple of days
I've literally had to wear my winter
jacket hopefully by the time we get back
from LA which will be Monday it'll be
warm here so come on New Jersey what lip
color should I do I'm gonna use the new
honest Asya gloss I haven't tried these
yet do I want to do pink
um I'm um I'm just going to go in with
my world pencil because I don't really
like how light this is
I love lip liners because it really
changes the color of the lips so like if
you aren't too fond of the color and you
add a little lip liner like I'm probably
gonna like this how it looks after
so it changed the entire color of the
lips it's not so light in pink that is
basically it as far as makeup I'm
probably just going to leave my hair
straight for this haul so I'm not gonna
bore you guys any longer with my
rambling I hope you guys enjoyed this
video it's just a quick easy look that I
tend to always do when I'm filming I
always like to put on a little extra
because the lights really wash you out
so that is it for now I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I love you guys so
much and until next time I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
