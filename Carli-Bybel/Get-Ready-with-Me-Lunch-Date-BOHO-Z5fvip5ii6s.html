figured I would feel myself getting
ready today I have a lunch date up north
and since the place is a little bit
fancier I figured you know what I'm
gonna wear some heels I'm gonna do my
makeup and I decided to film the look it
is a boho inspired look now that summer
is officially here I love boho looks and
I will be doing a lot more hair
tutorials that we wear a little bit more
fun but for today I didn't have a lot of
time so I just wanted to do some big
loose waves but back to my makeup just
blending in all of my foundation with my
damn Beauty Blender and for concealer
I'm using my dark circle erasers where
they get a drugstore and definitely my
top favorite athlete rubs for
one problem that I have with some of the
concealers is that crease is badly under
my eyes and this one with the Maybelline
they're super thin so yeah it may look
like a lot of makeup but once you blend
it in it really is a nice thin layer so
it's gonna cover nice but it's not gonna
feel cakey or anything like that
moving on to contour I'm using and the
beautiful bronze shade and I am
contouring my cheeks along my forehead
also on the tip of my nose along my
jawline and then also on the sides of my
nose
to blend in my forehead I am using my
damp Beauty Blender and then I'm
grabbing this brush to blend in the
sides of my cheeks just because it gives
me a little bit more control the reason
I drew my line a little bit above where
my actual natural cheekbone is is
because when I blend it out sometimes or
what I used to do is I would apply it
right where my actual line is and then
when I would blend it it would kind of
lower my cheek bone which would make my
jaw look too small it's kind of hard to
explain but if you guys know the basics
of contour and highlight its really to
accentuate your own features so that's
why I apply the contour a little bit
higher now because when it's blended out
it's gonna give it a much more natural
look to set underneath my eyes I'm
applying my Laura Mercier powder and I'm
applying an excess amount I'm gonna be
wiping off the extra in a little bit so
don't worry it looks super white and
weird right now but we are doing
something what some people like to call
baking and I've tried this technique a
few times and I kind of go back and
forth on different techniques I like to
try different things all the time with
makeup so this time around I'm gonna
bake my face while I start applying my
eyebrows I'm sealing my eyebrows with my
model in a bottle and then I'm wiping
off all of that extra powder so my skin
will be looking back to normal and
crease free
for my eyeshadow I'm using this new pH
palette and I'm picking up this light
champagne / pink eyeshadow I love their
baked eyeshadows because they're so
pigmented I always like to dip my brush
into fix+
beforehand you can also use eye drops or
whatever just to get the brush wet it's
gonna really bring out the pigment I'm
picking up that brown color and blending
that out with my crease and I'm using
something with a flat edge just to make
sure the line is perfect and I'm getting
my eye shadow in all the right places to
darken up my crease I'm picking up this
black sparkly color from Sigma and I'm
applying that on the outer V
for eyeliner I'm using the tattoo
eyeliner by Kat Von D and for lashes I
actually mixed a pair of velour lashes
with my Ardell whispies so that is the
concoction that I got there picking up
that same color I put on my lid I'm
applying that in my tear duct and then
with another big shadow it's a little
bit of a purple tone I'm applying that
on the rest of my lower lash line next
comes mascara you guys know the deal
to make this look a bit more dramatic I
am lining my inner waterline with a
black eye pencil this one is from Sigma
feel free to use whichever one you like
I like this one because it comes out
really black and it stays that way
her bronzer I am using this one by Mac I
keep forgetting the name of it but I
will list it below as usual it has a
beautiful highlight in it so it's just
gonna get my skin a really pretty
ron's dewy look I'm not gonna be going
in with any contour shades for this so
just make sure your bronzing up your
face as well as your neck cuz we want it
all to match
to contour my nose I'm grabbing just a
little bit of this shadow with this
pointed a tapered blending brush and I
am just pondering the sides of my nose
for highlighter I am using the new Elvis
Katya highlighters I just got it in the
mail today so I couldn't resist I had to
try them out and this one is so gorgeous
it's super pigmented it's really shiny
and you guys know how much I love
highlighters for your blush I am using
this new one that I actually just picked
up from Ulta it's by NYX and I love the
color of it for lips I am using this
pencil by Estee Lauder I picked this one
up because this is the one that fives
they used on me when I was back in
London and I think it's such a great
color as is I was going to leave it as
is but I felt like it kind of looks
pretty similar to maybe some other lip
colors that I always use so I'm just
throwing on a little light coat of
little itzá by Kat Von D and that's
gonna finish off the makeup look
and then to top off the whole look and
keep it on all day I am using the NYX
setting spray so now moving on to my
hair I'm applying two tracks of my
Bellamy hair extensions I don't need
them for length anymore but I love
having them in my hair when I curl them
because it just makes it super
voluminous I am using the six in one
curling wand which is basically the only
curling one that I use it's amazing and
it comes with six different heads so I'm
using I think the biggest head that it
comes with because I just want really
loose waves
you guys have seen me curl my hair like
a bajillion times so I'm gonna try and
speed this up as quick as possible I'll
leave a little bit in for those of you
guys that want to see my random
technique I feel like every time I curl
my hair I do something different and it
always comes out different but this is
just gonna give you some nice big though
who waves and what I'm doing when I
finish a section is I'm spraying it with
hairspray and then I'm just scrunching
it up it's like a big nest I guess and
I'm just clipping it into place this is
gonna help keep your curls in a little
bit longer and it's also gonna give it
that nice messy textured look I can't
escape fall so I think about is you
baby there's this there it's the only
thing holding me back from you so sick
Oh baby I'm so sick
you know wanna touch your bag
I don't this secret
Jessica missing you baby I'm so sick of
missing you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
