face this new primer is one that I've
been using lately it's my cover effects
it's the mattifying primer with anti
acne treatment I've been using this
because I broke out a little bit so I've
been using this one just because it says
that it has anti acne treatment in it so
try prevent any more pimples from coming
also I wanted to thank you guys I
tweeted asking if anyone had any
recommendations for like good acne face
wash because it's really been a while
since I've broken out I saw a couple
people recommend the same one and I was
right by Walgreens so I went and I
picked it up the noxee my brand I bought
the face wash and then I also bought
these and literally my pimples have gone
away so quickly so thank you guys to
everyone who recommended that and I saw
so many other good recommendations that
I didn't actually get to get to it was
only because I was right by Walgreens
and I didn't have time to UM go to like
a regular store for foundation I'm
mixing the Too Faced Born This Way along
with my L'Oreal True Match Lumi this one
is in golden and this color is warm
beige I got the whole kit of these a few
days ago maybe like a couple weeks ago
now and I don't know I've tried this new
mixture with which I'm gonna be showing
you guys today and I just love how
flawless my makeup looks so I'm not sure
if it's the primer if it's the
foundation arts the concealer or it's
kind of all of them mixed together but
it's just given me like such a flawless
finish I'm gonna put a couple pumps on
the back of my hand and then I'm gonna
mix in a lumi stuff and then start
pinked in the face if you're doing it
for yourself or if you're doing it on
clients um just mix the foundations on
the back of your hand that way when you
start paying on you can see if the color
is right so yes I think this is good and
we're going to be doing highlighting and
contouring and all that stuff anyway so
even if the color isn't perfect don't
even worry about it I wanted to do like
a chitchat get ready with me because I
feel like so much has been going on
so I'd update you guys a little bit um
so yes no two days ago Brett had
shoulder surgery so you know he actually
filmed like a vlog and he's gonna fill
you guys all in on like why I don't want
to spoil it for him but um so he's been
really feeling crappy on the couch and
I've been kind of taking care of him so
I was planning on filming this yesterday
but he was just in so much pain
yesterday it was the second day out so I
just wanted to kind of relax with him
and be there for him because he can't
really do much so so that's the update
with that I'm gonna spray a little bit
of the fix+
on my brush and then I'm gonna start
blending it again so I know a lot of you
guys were asking what the deal is with
LA and I know Nicole announced it on her
snapchat and I didn't wanna something I
didn't want to tell you guys right away
it's just I honestly haven't even told
anybody my family yet um just because it
was so like last-minute spur the moment
type of thing but um the let not this
time that would just pass but time
before that like 3-4 weeks ago that we
were all in LA we were out there for
business and it's just a very expensive
trip to go out there um with the hotel
and everything like that so when we were
out there usually it's like me and a
call will go off and do our thing and
then Jeremy and Brett are like doing
whatever um and they went and they
actually looked at a couple apartments
so actually let me start from the
beginning so three times ago when we
went to LA me and Brett stayed with my
friend her OSHA's boyfriend and he has
an apartment opposite where but we were
staying with him and we were thinking
about maybe looking at an apartment not
permanently but just to look and see if
there was anything out there since we're
always going out there anyway so we
looked at a few apartments in his
building and they're really really nice
but the one that we kind of liked um got
sold so we were like alright whatever
we'll just keep calling back and seeing
if anything opens up so then when we
went last time with Nicole and Jeremy um
me Nicole were out shopping or doing
whatever we were doing and the boys went
and I guess there was like a new
apartment that had opened up so when we
were all at dinner that night they were
like so we have some news for you
they decided to tell us that there was
like this really really nice apartment
like it just opened up it's gonna be
gone if we don't get it so you went and
we saw it and it literally was like so
much nicer than the other ones that we
had looked at the previous time so we
figured since it's two bedroom why not
split it that way whenever we go out
there we don't have to pay our hotel
because one trip out there would cost
the same as a splitting rent so we
decided to get an apartment together
we're always together when we're out
there anyway and it's funny because I
see them more than I see some of my
friends back home and yeah so that's the
big news
we got place in LA we're not moving
there permanently we're keeping our
places on the East Coast
I don't everyone moved there permanently
nothing against it but I just prefer the
East Coast I don't know it's just my
home so we'll never move there
permanently
I mean Brett would wanna in a second but
um an East Coast girl so we're actually
looking at some places to buy an Jersey
because we're still renting right now
and um I keep seeing people request like
a house tour but the thing is when we
moved in here I wanted to get set up my
beauty room in my closet everything
because I have so much stuff but I
didn't want to really like set up the
entire house because I know we're only
renting and I knew it was lying to me
like a year or two so I that's the
reason I haven't done like a house tour
or anything like that because I feel
like once I buy something I know I'm
going to be there longer than a year
then I'm gonna fully decorate it and
make it like my own but again after our
first place together
I actually went a little bit crazy and I
decorated it I spend a lot of money and
then when we moved here nothing matched
like nothing matched the walls and since
we're renting we couldn't really paint
so I decided to not go crazy and
decorate this place really nice I kind
of just got the necessities like a couch
TV table all that stuff so that's why I
haven't done that yeah but just wanted
to update you guys on that so you guys
all know before my own family so hope
you feel special so next for concealer
I'm using the Tarte creaseless concealer
in light medium I love this concealer I
love it because I had like a peachy tone
to
it so I'm just applying that under my
ass so that was like the reason that we
went back last week was just to buy some
beds and like to set it up a little bit
what else is new and exciting oh um if
you guys told me on snapchat maybe saw
that I was babysitting my kitty brother
while my mom was away Brett was actually
a way that weekend for a bachelor party
so I was scared to be alone anyway I
just haven't stayed alone since I moved
out I like made my friends sleep over
and then Brett came right into my life
so I haven't really ever been alone and
I'm just such a baby like I swear I
think there's like monsters in my closet
still so it was good that I had him to
keep me company and I was a little
nervous at first I only plan on keeping
him one night because my sister was
gonna take him I've always been like
deathly allergic to any type of animals
and any time I go to my mom's like a
student I walk in the door I would just
art sneezing so I figured you know what
I'll take him for the first night
because my sister works all day and it
just wouldn't be fair to keep him alone
if I could just keep him and I had him
the entire weekend she didn't even end
up getting him so like a Monday and I
wasn't it she and I was perfectly fine
and I think the reason is because right
before my mom left she took him to the
groomer and she got him basically all
shades and gave him like that lion
haircut which was so cute so I think she
was just cleaned and he was shaved
basically everywhere that's why I was
okay since he is a long-haired cat I
feel like I'm mostly allergic to like
the smell of them and they haven't been
groomed in a while and then all the hair
everywhere so I was completely fine and
then when Brett got home he actually
stayed with us Monday night - and Brett
got to witness him in the house and
Brett was fine too because usually
Brett's a lot more allergic to cats than
dogs and I'm just equally allergic to
everything so that's the reason we
haven't gotten a pet but I seemed okay
so now I'm wondering can we get a cat so
we've been like looking into getting
cats we've been calling a couple
different shelters and we just told them
to like keep us in mind if any like
kids come in so fingers crossed it was
just so cool having a little buddy in
the house of me like I felt like a mom
when we went and stayed with Nepal and
Jeremy in Florida it was so funny
because like every five minutes Nicole
would get up and be like babies babies
and like look for them and be worried
and then when I was babysitting Oliver I
went upstairs and I came down I couldn't
find him I was literally searching
everywhere I'm like where's Oliver C's
did he escape like I was freaking out
so it's so funny because now I totally
get why she's like that it's like you
just they're your little babies and you
gotta just protect them and make sure
they're okay and they don't run away and
I just liked having that responsibility
so we shall see hopefully we'll have a
new member of the family soon and I feel
like if anyone should have a pet it's us
because we're home almost every single
day like all day so we wouldn't leave
him or her and so I'm excited about that
I feel like this videos gonna be so much
longer than normal so I hope you guys
don't mind but I just why did it fill
you guys in because it's been a while um
what else
Oh Monday I have a dentist appointment I
think I'm gonna need my wisdom tooth
pulled
I had one pulled oh like five years ago
just one and then this one I have one on
the side and it's been growing in and it
wasn't bothering me at all
so they said as long as it wasn't
bothering me like I should be fine but
the past couple of days it's been so bad
so it actually worked out perfect cuz I
had a dentist appointment on Monday
anyway and I was thinking about
canceling it but now that I'm in so much
pain I figured I'll just keep it and
then go see what is up but if I need
that Pulte I'm gonna cry I the worst
pain tolerance like I am the biggest
baby of life and the first time that I
got it pulled I was literally on my
couch for a full week like just moaning
in pain so that'll be fun I look like a
nice little chick bunk alright so I
wanted to quickly let you guys know um
in my last video when I had talked about
nose contour I told you guys about
bitch I told you about how I've been
using just this la girl concealer
instead of that brush that I had showed
you so what I do is I just take a little
bit on the back of my hand
that's a lot actually
just so I don't have too much and then I
start contouring and normally I was only
using like gray or tones and I found
that this color and this brush is just
perfect I feel like it's just like the
right size like it's like the perfect
thickness I feel like I've been using
just this for so long now and it's like
if I could find one product that I love
for contouring like I'll never stop
using it because I've just been always
searching for something and none nothing
really works as good as this and it's so
cheap like you can't get that
for today's I look I wanted to do
something really summery because I feel
like summer is basically over and I
didn't really do any like summer look so
I feel like this is going to be like one
of my last maybe like I'll do one more
summery look but it's so weird people
are like - back-to-school looks can you
do um like fall looks and I'm like shoot
fall looks I didn't even do anything
really summer looks like where does the
time go it's just so crazy plus
traveling so much doesn't help um it's
actually kind of annoying traveling so
much I love just getting home and just I
don't know just something about getting
home but actually oh talking about
getting home when we landed on Tuesday
we didn't even realize but there was
like a huge explosion on the Turnpike
and we were stuck in traffic for four
hours so that's how long our flight took
so we could have went back to LA in the
amount of time so we literally got out
of the airport and just set a nap in
traffic we were in one spot for an hour
literally did not move there was cars
all around us moving we were stuck in
this lane behind this big truck and it
wouldn't move I was literally having a
panic attack it was probably the worst
experience ever but I was like of course
the day that we land just the exact same
time we're stuck in traffic is this a
sign do we need to go back to LA and
move there and then all that was like
come on
well let's not push it here it's nice to
visit but it's always nice to come home
I haven't even talked about how exciting
it is though it really is it's so funny
because meaningful are the same way like
we are so excited about things but we
don't let things like faze us it doesn't
seem real to we're actually there so
like right now I'm like do I have an
apartment ally I feel like remind myself
that I do like once we're back there
it's like like oh my god we really do
have it all spore get along so well it's
always so much fun when we're together
so the hotter time next I'm just going
to set my under eyes with my secret
brightening powder so you just want to
make sure you're getting all the creases
out I like doing one eye at a time
because mine just crease instantly and
I'm taking my little powder puff and
powdering it should I apologize because
this
err you just cannot handle it anymore
I'm buying anyone I apologize because
it's so annoying
and then I'm playing a little bit
under and lately I haven't been
contouring lately with um a cream
contour like I used to it just because
it's summer it's too thick otherwise so
I just do this and then I'll go in with
like a bronzer cute right next comes
brows I'm using my brow bar to go along
with my eyebrow brush I'm just setting
it with some clear brow gel so next I'm
just going to wipe under my eyes off
with this brush I'm just going to prime
my eyes with stayed on straigh I'm using
this color right here this is the morphe
35o palette um i never used these before
but I was testing on they're so
pigmented so I'm going to pick up it has
like a lightish pink to it I'm going to
pick that one up and I'm applying it on
my eyelids I swear morphe MBH they're so
affordable and their colors are just as
good like don't spend your money on all
these high and eyeshadow palettes and
you can get so much more for your money
like when I first started freelancing
all I ever used was BH because that's
all I could afford
and I still to this day use them more
than any other brand so just a quick
little note for anybody out there that
feel they can't afford some of these
products that a lot of people are
recommending you don't need to spend
that much and you'll get a gorgeous
gorgeous look still this is super random
but I'm actually taking this matte shade
for my lighter brow bar to go umm I just
like using these as shadows but I'm
taking that with my big fluffy brush and
I'm applying this in the crease
this is just a very light light brown
and then picking up this shade and I'm
going right over that crease color so
now for my inner tear-duct I'm mixing I
have my Mac white gold pigment and I'm
also mixing mermaid fantasy by artist
Couture then this is a gorgeous like
iridescent greenish color brush I'm
applying a little bit of the Mac pigment
you can see it's like a really pretty
iridescent shade for line arm using the
tattoo eyeliner by Kat Von D I saw a
couple people asking why I didn't
mention an eyeliner brush in my previous
video and it's only because the past
couple months I've been using this so
it's like a little felt tip marker for
lashes I'm using my cardi lash by the
lure these are a new pair so I just have
to cut them to fit my eyes really
quickly for my inner lash line I'm using
this mint eyeliner from Stila these are
so pigmented I'm applying this right in
the lower lash line using the shade
right here I'm gonna be lining my lower
lash line I like to make the lower lash
line a lot thicker because it covers all
my little under eye wrinkles just a
little tip next I have by BH Cosmetics
it's glitter eyeliner in synergy at that
same iridescent color I'm just gonna
line my upper lash line with this like
right above the black
so now we're going to just wipe off this
powder for bronzer I'm using global glow
by mass for blush I'm going to be using
this peach color this one's from my ELF
quad blush palette for lips I'm using by
Mac fruit cocktail lipliner
so this one was razzle-dazzle ER and
then I'm going to put a little bit of
Nick's fireball on top and then I just
went over the liner with red by Mac to
highlight I'm going to use a mixture I'm
gonna use a little bit of the mermaid
fantasy just a little though and I'm
going to take a little bit of the laura
geller
umm gilded honey over it then to set my
face I'm using mac fix+ and coconut so
now let's move on to the hair just
looking at myself I'm just taking a
little bit of this loose powder and I'm
just gonna put this over the lipstick so
it's not so the laisse like too much
gloss makes my lips look so big
alright so I'm just brushing up the hair
then I'm just going to put some loose um
beachy waves because I feel like this I
make up look it screams mermaid so I'm
just gonna do some beachy waves when I
was out in LA I got the tape is removed
because I just was not feeling them they
were really cool for like a short period
of time but my favorite thing of life is
like at the end of the day taking off
all my makeup
taking out the clippings if I have him
in and then brought just rubs my head
like this and with the tape ins he
wasn't able to do that because they
weren't permanent I recommend them if
you want permanent extensions they were
definitely cool they didn't ruin my hair
or anything but my hair is so long like
this is all my hair so it wasn't really
needed I'm gonna put some heat
protectant spray this one is by Schwartz
cub and I'm not going to do any
extensions for today just because
I know I don't feel like putting them in
right now
I hope you guys enjoyed this video let
me know if you guys want any more summer
makeup looks or if we're ready to move
on to fall / back-to-school which is
just weird but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I love you guys so much and
until next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
