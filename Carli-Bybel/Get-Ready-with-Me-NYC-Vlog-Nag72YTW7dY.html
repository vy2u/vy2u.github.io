I'm going to get right into the video
today I am going to a Broadway play in
New York City so I wanted to let you
guys get ready with me starting off this
look by applying my pursuade eyeshadow
base all over my lids following that I'm
grabbing the Maybelline nude palette I
think that's what it's called I'm
grabbing this white shade and I'm
applying it all over my eyelid then with
a large blending brush I'm picking up
this I don't know if it's like a dark
brown a little bit of a grayish brown
color I'm applying it right into my
crease just take a little bit at a time
until you get the desired darkness
grabbing my black gel liner I'm just
gonna be winging out my eyeliner feel
free to do whatever eyeliner you prefer
I know I always do a large wing I
promise in the future I will be doing
different types of videos with no wing
liner so don't you worry about that I'm
then picking up with my pencil brush
this copper shade from the new
anastasiya palettes
grabbing that same dark shade with a
smaller blending brush I'm going to make
the outer V a little bit darker so just
keep applying it on the outer V until
again you get it as dark as you want
grabbing this yellow Mac pigment I'm not
exactly sure the name of it I will list
it below I'm applying this right in the
inner tear-duct
moving on to my face I'm priming my face
with my Mac strobe cream I'm applying
this with my fingers all over my face
you just want to make sure it's nice and
even then for foundation I'm using my
favorite Chanel foundation I'm super
pale so I'm using it in the color 30 I
believe
next up I'm contouring my nose I'm using
the la girl Pro concealer in the color
beautiful bronze I'm applying this on my
nose on my cheekbones around my forehead
and also on my chin
moving on to concealer I am using mac
prolongwear concealer in NC 15 and I'm
just applying this with my Mac brush
underneath my eyes
then grabbing my NARS concealer I'm
going to use that to highlight not
exactly sure the shade I know it's not
mustard it's the one below and it's a
little bit lighter so I will find out
and write it for you guys but I'm just
applying this under my eyes on the
bridge of my nose also on top of my
brows and on my chin and I'm blending
that in with my damp Beauty Blender
so I started contouring my cheeks with
my Anastasia palette and then I realized
my brows needed to be finished I hadn't
finished them earlier so I'm using my
brow bar to go in the darker shade
so once I finish contouring I'm going to
apply a little bit more mascara under my
eyes and I'm gonna go over the eye
shadow as well just because I want it to
really pop and sometimes when you apply
your foundation or concealer it can kind
of lighten everything a bit I'm then
applying a clear brow gel to hold my
brows in place and then I'm using the
banana powder from the same palette to
highlight under my eyes and everywhere
else that I highlighted for lips I'm
using Mac's or lip pencil and I'm just
filling in my lips with the entire color
so it's gonna give it a nice pinkish
matte shade just because my lips are
super dry I'm gonna be applying a
chapstick just to give it a little bit
of moisture for blush I'm using this
pink one by Tarte and last but not least
I'm going to apply some bronzer on my
neck on my chest and a little bit on my
face because feeling super pale and we
want our chest to match our face we
don't want it to look like I'm wearing a
mask here so now moving on to hair I'm
gonna apply two tracks of my hair
extensions so I'm just sectioning off my
hair and I'm applying the two tracks
with the four clips on each the
extensions are now the same length as my
hair so I just like to add it for a
thickness when I'm going out at home or
if I'm doing something low-key I won't
wear the extensions but I like to add a
little bit of thickness
I showered and blow-dried my hair last
night just because I knew I had to wake
up early and I didn't have much time so
I like to just go over the front pieces
of my hair with a round brush and the
blow dryer just to give it a little
extra height and body so this is the
final result I didn't get a full outfit
picture but I do have a few photos
coming but I wanted to share with you
