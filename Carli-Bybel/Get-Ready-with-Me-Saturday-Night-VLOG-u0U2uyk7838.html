tonight I'm going on a dinner cruise
with my best friend mu her boyfriend and
Brett and this was her birthday gift to
me so I'm really really excited about it
so if you want to see how I got this
look please keep watching to prime my
face I'm using pores no more bye dr.
Brandt if there's anything left in this
thing
for foundation I'm mixing by Co Gendo
the aqua foundation in 143 and 113 I do
have the middle shade but since we're in
the middle of packing I just can't find
it so I'm going to mix these two for
today and to blend my foundation I'm
using this Sigma flat kabuki brush it's
number f80
for brows I'm using my brow bar to go in
the darkest shade
to contour my nose I'm using the la girl
in the color toast
and for concealer I'm using the new
Ultra HD concealer by Make Up For Ever
this is my first time trying it and I'm
really excited because I've heard great
things tonight we are going on a dinner
cruise in New York City move got us
tickets for this for my birthday which I
thought was a really cute idea I'm so
excited I feel like we've been talking
about this for so long and it's the day
is finally here so she's actually coming
over in a little bit to get ready here
but I figured I'd do the bulk of it on
camera that way I can get a video up for
you guys because it's been very crazy we
close on our house this Tuesday finally
we were supposed to close on November
20th
but um I guess that's just what happens
when you buy a house it just never
closes on the day that they say so it's
just been a very hectic couple of weeks
but I'm gonna start blending this out
first I'm just gonna use my fingers to
blend out very lightly the nose contour
and then I'm going to use my Beauty
Blender to blend out the concealer
you
so I'm really liking how this concealer
is blending out it's really really
creamy and it covers nice sometimes I'll
have to do like two layers of concealer
if the concealer maybe doesn't cover as
much but I think this should be good I'm
taking a little bit more of that toast
and I'm just going to carve out the
cheekbones it's honestly been like a
week probably over a week since I've
actually done my makeup so I'm doing it
above and beyond tonight it's been nice
though giving my skin a break and I'm
just blending that in with my Mac 130
brush I like to do this when I'm doing a
more dramatic look because it kind of
sets up the base and it helps make your
makeup look fresh all night so basically
what you're doing is you're setting the
groundwork for the powder that way the
powder has something to really stick to
and it's a really good undertone to
bring out the contours and the
highlights and all that good stuff so
normally I won't do this unless I know I
have to go somewhere that my makeup
needs to last all night so if like
wedding or something like that that's
when I would do this as well
I'm so excited because in this place and
the place we were in before I never
really decorated the downstairs I got I
mean we did the couch and the TVs and
all that but I never fully decorated
because I knew it was gonna be temporary
and move you don't know what color
schemes everything's gonna be so I
always did like my beauty room that was
in my one room to really decorate and
make my special room but now in the new
place I'm excited because our plan is to
stay there probably forever I mean never
know forever forever but um we plan on
staying there for a really long time so
I'm excited to actually decorate I don't
know how good I am at interior design so
I guess some we shall see but I've been
all over Pinterest and everything like
that just seeing pictures so if any of
you guys know any good websites please
let me know there's so many good sales
this weekend which is annoying because I
can't get to the house tell I think
we're gonna do the walkthrough on Monday
so I need to like measure rooms to see
like what can go where there's a
standing room table that I fell in love
with and it comes in like 10 sizes so ah
the struggles of moving into a new house
but it's gonna be fun I've never done
anything like this I'm thinking of
bringing my blog camera tonight and then
maybe like vlogging a little bit and
then I could put at the end of this
video so you could see it's all just
very nicely blended in it doesn't look
harsh and it does not feel cakey
whatsoever it literally feels like I
have nothing on my face right now which
is really nice I'm just gonna blend out
the under eye wrinkles and then I'm
gonna set it with my Laura Mercier
translucent brightening powder or
whatever it's called I'm just applying
that under my eyes not gonna do that big
triangle um I don't know I noticed
whenever I tried to bake it just feels
like way too much makeup like too cakey
so this is the way that I've been doing
it as of lately my routine changes all
the time so just kind of depends on the
mood
so you can see I'm just applying it
right underneath where I always get
those little wrinkles set my nose
contour i'm using the heroine shadow and
i'm just using a little bit and i'm
going to apply it right over the nose
and this is just to set the cream and to
accentuate the news of course
and then to set the concealer under my
eyes I'm using in p20 the coverfx
foundation powder
from the Carli bybel palette I'm picking
up this mauve shade right here I feel
like I use it in every single look but
it's a good crease color I'm just
applying this in the crease of my eye
you
on my lid I'm applying this Maybelline
Color tattoo it's like a mint green
color and I'm just applying this right
on my eyelid just a little bit
I'm picking up a little bit of the color
comment from my BH Galaxy chic palette
I'm going to apply that right over the
mint
with a pencil brush I'm picking up this
matte brown shade and I'm applying it in
between the green and below the mob
shade
and I'm just grabbing a little bit more
that mob shoot and kind of blending it
so it gives it a pretty blended look to
highlight under my brow picking up this
shade right here
I'm just blending the brown down onto
the mint to have it blend from the mint
to the brown to the mob
4-letter I'm using the Kat Von D tattoo
liner for lashes I'm using Miami by Lily
lashes I do have a new coupon code for
her lashes if you guys want to try them
out they're amazing
everything will be listed below so you
guys can go check that out but I'm just
gonna apply these and then you'll see me
in a second I'm taking a little bit more
of that mint shade and I'm applying it
just on the inner half of my lower lash
line I'm going back to that matte Brown
and I'm applying that on the outer half
I'm also picking a little bit of that
plum the darkest plum shade in my
palette and kind of mixing it to give it
a little bit of that plum look
to bronze up my face I'm using the new
morphe contour kit I'm going to use this
one and then the shimmer one
you
now this is the first time I'm using
this palette and I like it because it
has a mixture of warm and cool tones so
I'm kind of like mixing a bunch together
as I'm using it and so far so good it
doesn't go on like chalky or anything it
seems to be blending really nice which
is good now I'm most likely I don't know
what I'm wearing it but I'm most likely
gonna wear like long sleeves and pants
since that's what I always tend to wear
when it's colder out and that way I can
make my face a little bit Tanner than my
body because you won't be seeing my body
so again I'm not exactly sure what I'm
going to wear I'm going to try a few
things but um we shall see
for blush I'm using dainty by Mac is a
mineralized blush
I love these blushes because they have
like a sheen to them so you could skip
out on the highlighter if you want for
lips I'm using stolen lip liner by Mac
and then I'm using invasion liquid
lipstick by Gerard cosmetics
to highlight my nose I'm using that same
pink color that I use to highlight my
brows
I'm going to use a little bit of that on
my cheeks just I'm going to set my
makeup with the NYX matte finishing
spray just because it's right over here
what did with the hair
up
we're down
okay so I decided I'm gonna do a
ponytail because I don't know I just
like doing it um I also put a little bit
of the bite Beauty lip mask whatever
it's called on my lips because my lips
were a little bit too dry or the matte
lipstick what I'm going to do is use a
brush like this and some hairspray
actually no first I'm gonna take a
little argan oil this is my GK argan oil
and I'm just putting it on the ends of
my hair and I'm also since I am doing
the pony I'm just going to kind of run
it across the top to take away any of
the flyaways and to kind of smooth it
out then I'm going to make sure that the
part is straight because it's definitely
not
I think the hardest part for me is
getting this part smooth so I always
like to pre smooth before I grab it that
way it makes it a little bit easier
so this is the final result I am going
to put my shoes on head out the door and
I am so excited I'm going to bring my
camera and try and vlog a little bit of
it to include in the end of this video
but I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and until next time I will see you guys
later

boots on head downstairs Nicole and Pat

city tonight because it's open bar so

hi guys so it's currently Sunday morning
it's 11 a.m. so last night didn't really
go as planned and I wanted to vlog the
whole experience for you guys so I felt
I should give you an explanation as to
what kind of happened last night so our
plan obviously was to go on the dinner
cruise but when we got there we waited
on like an hour line in 30-degree
weather and when we got on the boat it
was so packed that you literally
couldn't even move
we went and she had bought tickets this
was for my birthday guest and she had
bought tickets that we were supposed to
have like dinner and stuff like that we
went over and it was a buffet and
everything was literally already gone so
we went down to the lower level same
thing really really really packed every
table was taken and the bar downstairs
was closed so we kind of just really
quickly all looked at each other more
like let's go get dinner somewhere else
so it's okay it really just wasn't what
we expected which is fine we just didn't
want to be stuck on the boat for four
hours not being able to move not being
able to eat or drink anything because we
were all dying of hunger so we went to
mr. Chow's and we had a lot of food and
we had a lot of fun so I just wanted to
fill you guys in on what happened I
think it's so funny that's literally our
lives like we always have plans to do
stuff and she never works out that's why
we just don't like going to New York
City especially any time we have plans
to go there like our plan just always
end up changing but everything happens
for a reason we didn't stay out as late
as we probably would have so I was up
bright and early and I'm actually on my
way to meet my mom right now we are
going to get mattresses she needs a new
mattress because her head this is camera
might move so we should see how this
but on her head or neck everything's
been really bothering her so she's been
needing a new mattress and the mattress
that we have me and Brett have right now
is actually my mom and dad's old
mattress from when I lived in my
original house which was no six years
ago now so I'll tell you a quick story
about that mattress not that it really
matters so the mattress that we have now
it's called or was called or is called I
guess the cloud when we were younger my
parents got that and it was too soft so
they ended up putting that in our spare
bedroom in our old house and literally
Everson like me my sister would sleep in
the bed because it was just so comfy it
felt like a cloud so you would literally
lie in it and just sink into it so
everyone always wanted to sleep over my
house because we had the cloud so that
has been our mattress when we moved I
was like sorry mom sinkings mattress and
I've had that one ever since and very
down where she goes
so Nicole life is a mess right now
Nicole Guerrero told me about this
little pan that you can put your camera
on and that's what I was using but I
think I accidentally threw it out when
we got this car our lease was up and I
guess it was like kind of October so why
do I he'd be like a door or was open
