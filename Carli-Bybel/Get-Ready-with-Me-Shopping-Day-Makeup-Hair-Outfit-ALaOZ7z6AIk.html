the time
to me my sweetest
take it back way
and this is
come to me
we're scared when
hi everyone thank you for watching to
start off this look I'm applying my
Smashbox primer all over my face
following that I'm using my Rimmel
foundation and I'm applying it all over
my face with my Sigma foundation brush
to fill in my brows I'm using the brow
gel by anastasia beverly hills
next I'm using a cream contour to
contour my nose as well as the sides of
my cheeks around my forehead and
underneath my chin
you
for this look I'm using my galaxy chic
palette from BH Cosmetics and I'm using
the color called Sun and I'm applying
this all over my lids I'm dipping my
brush into the fix+ that way the pigment
is extra strong
grabbing the color Mars with my blending
brush I'm going to be applying this
right in the crease and I'm blending it
up towards my eyebrow when you use this
brush it does a lot of the work for you
so you can just do these windshield
wiper movements and it'll be perfect
for false lashes i'm using the Ardell
whispies and i just cut them in half and
I'm applying them on the outer corner of
my eye following that I'm using the
L'Oreal telescopic mascara to line my
lower lash line I'm using me Stila
cosmetics foil shadows in the color
comics gold and I'm dipping my brush
into fix+ or you can use a little liquid
that it comes with and I'm lining my
lower lash line and then following that
I'm grabbing the same Mars color from
the beach palette and I'm lining the
outer part of my lower lash line for
concealer I'm using Laura Mercier as
usual and sc3 and I'm just applying this
on all the areas I want to highlight my
face
to set my foundation I'm using the
Rimmel stay matte powder and I'm using
just my foundation brush to apply it all
over my face this is going to give it a
nice matte finish for blush i'm using
the color angelica by NARS it was from
the holiday edition palette
and then for lip liner I'm using
sugarplum by Milani cosmetics and I'm
going to be lining my lips be careful
when you use a dark color like this
because if you mess up it's impossible
to get it off your skin for lipstick I'm
mixing two colors I'm using Mac rebel
and I'm using Milani in black cherry
you
so moving on to hair I'm going to be
using the Bellamy
16:1 curler and I'm just going to be
doing big waves in my hair because I'm
going to be wearing a beanie this one is
definitely my favorite I like how it's
thicker at the bottom and then it gets
smaller I do have a 160 dollar off code
and it is Karli 160 in all lower case I
will have that all listed below but as
you can see I'm just leaving it on for a
few seconds just to get some big waves
in my hair
once I finish this side I'm using bumble
to bumble surf spray and then I'm going
to just scrunch my hair a little bit and
then moving on to the other side I'm
just doing the exact same step taking
large pieces of hair and curling them
away from my face
so this is the final result I'm off to
go pick up my cousin and then over to
the mall so I hope you guys enjoyed this
look it's definitely a little something
different I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and until next time I'll see you
guys later
I'll be confusing for you be sweet now
be grateful cover me with kisses dear
lighten up the atmosphere keep me warm
inside I bet I got dreams of you all
through my head fortune teller said I'd
be free and that's the day you came to
me
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
