yeah would it be
oh start off this look I'm going to
be covering up my lovely pimples that I
got going on here this is my ELF
concealer and it has acne treatment in
it so I love using this right before I
apply my primer and my foundation
grabbing my next angel veil I'm just
applying a little bit right onto my
hands and I'm applying this all over my
face this is my foundation primer
for foundation I'm using this BB cream
by Tarte cosmetics and I'm mixing it
with this illuminator this one I picked
up from Sephora recently and I really
love how she Marie it is I love mixing
in an illuminator with my foundation
especially for the summertime because it
really gives your skin a beautiful
healthy glow to apply my foundation I'm
using my Beauty Blender and I've really
been loving this lately in place of my
foundation brush it just really really
seeps into your pores and gives your
face a really flawless finish
next up I'm contouring my nose and if
you guys want to see a more in depth
video on how I contour my nose and a
couple of my tricks that I use let me
know and comment below because I'll
definitely get that up for you guys
to contour my cheekbones I'm using this
flat brush by Mac I'm grabbing that same
cream contour and I'm starting from my
cheekbone and I'm blending it upwards
really contouring out my cheeks and I'm
also applying this on my forehead my
chin and just blending out the sides of
my nose for concealer I'm using my dark
eraser concealer and this one you can
find at your drugstore and I'm blending
this in with my Beauty Blender
using whatever product is left on the
Beautyblender I'm just gonna run that
right down the center of my nose in
between my brows and on my chin and to
set all this I'm using my matte powder
by Rimmel
moving onto brows I'm just going to keep
this sped up because you've seen me do
my brows many a times and I also have my
brow tutorial for a more in-depth look
here I'm just using a dark brown brow
powder from Sigma and my Anastasia
Beverly Hills brush
then grabbing my clear brow gel I'm just
going to brush my brows into place so
they don't move
moving on to eyes I'm using my Sigma
eyeshadow base in the color neutral eyes
and it's a really pretty orange color
then right over that I'm mixing these
two eyeshadows from my bare minerals
palette and it's going to give you a
really pretty peachy bronze look
grabbing this matte brown color I'm then
very lightly blending this right into my
crease and upward this is going to start
to create some dimension then grabbing
my pencil brush and this dark brown
matte shadow I'm going to be coloring in
the outer V of my eye to achieve this
look I like to look down and then
straight at my mirror that way I can
really see the shape of my eye and just
fill it in and while doing this will
make sure that the darkest color doesn't
get too high towards your brown
using that same color I'm then dragging
the line right underneath my lower lash
line grabbing a smaller blending brush
on then just going to blend in all the
work that I've just done using the color
kitten I'm just highlighting my inner
tear-duct also underneath my brows
grabbing a little bit more of that pink
color that I originally used on my lid
I'm just dragging it underneath my eyes
then I'm lining my eyes with my BH gel
liner
next I'm adding a little bit of bronzer
to my cheeks and this is the shimmery
bronzer by BH and then right over that
I'm applying some blush and since this
whole look is a peachy bronzy look I'm
going to be using my NARS blush in the
color super orgasm using my Kiko
eyeshadow and number 208 I'm applying
that as a highlight right onto my
cheekbones
you
I'm then lining my lips with a peachy
bronze color by NYX and I will list all
these names of all the products I used
on my blog as usual but to line my inner
lash line I'm using light black liner
and then for lipstick I'm using my new
one by back in C Kelly Osbourne limited
edition lipstick and then I'm going back
to my lip liner and I'm just filling in
my lips and up doing the ombre look
which I had explained in my previous
video
then to finish off the lips I'm using
this loss find ours as well that's going
to give it a really pretty bronzy finish
using that same shadow in the color cane
to highlight my Cupid's bow and this is
the final result as far as they go so
now let's move on to the hairstyle
you're going to part your hair with a
deep side part and you're going to
section it off leaving the front pieces
down because I'm going to be grading
this front piece you can make it as
thick as you want but you're just is
again section off the hair and then tie
back the rest of your hair that way it's
less confusing and it'll be easier to do
your braid so I'm doing a Dutch braid
which is a French braid but just
backwards and I had done a full video
like this after the Hunger Games video
came out I don't know I think a year ago
but if you guys don't know how to do it
it's just again the same thing as a
French braid but instead of crossing
over the middle piece you just cross
under the middle piece and I'm going to
be braiding down the front part of my
hair and then braiding it about half way
down you got something on me
you got something that keeps me on my
feet I don't know but I know
it's true that love makes no sense if
I'm not loving you now loving you
she runs around New City downtown always
catching the late train it's always a
good day likes to pretend the world is
her playpen dropping a bunny on
everything she sees she's content is on
her own
of the people that she loves and so Kate
with started stars from the places where
she was
you got something I need
I'm going crazy
you got something that keeps me on my
feet I don't know but I know that it's
true
that below makes no
love you
so once you braid it down you're going
to want to use a hair tie to fasten it
unfortunately I have no more of these
little tiny rubber bands that I always
used to use so I'm using a bigger hair
tie which is a little bit too big I
think in my opinion I would definitely
use a smaller one so this one will just
have to do for now but I'm slowly gonna
be pulling out the sides of the braid
that way it's not so tight and it's
gonna give it a really pretty full look
you got something
I'm going crazy you got something that
keeps me on my feet I don't know what it
is but I know that's true
that blow makes no sense
love you now
hello
I know everything you do so next I'm
gonna put some big loose waves in my
hair and give it a really beachy look
and I'm using my Bellamy 6 in-1 curler
and this one is definitely the only one
that I use at the moment it's my
absolute favorite it comes with all
different six head so you don't need to
buy six different ones but yeah so I'm
just doing this waves and I'm actually
not wearing any extensions in this video
my hair is finally growing so I just
thought for this fun beachy look I'm
gonna leave it without extensions so
this is all my natural hair once again
Oh
got something
Oh crazy
Casey
true
once you are done curling your hair if
you want some height you can tease the
back right in the roots which I am doing
as you can see right here and then once
I finish that I'm going to spray it and
then just form it so it's not looking
like a big rat's nest
okay so this is the final result this is
how I decided to do my hair makeup for
the evening I'm going out to dinner with
Bret and I'm gonna go pick out my outfit
so you'll see some pictures in a minute
and don't forget to go check out my blog
for more pictures of my outfit as well
as all details and all makeup products
used in this video I love you guys so
much and thank you so much for watching
