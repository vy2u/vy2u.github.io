today's video I'm going to take you guys
through a few of my favorite pampering
steps I get it that we all have crazy
schedules and sometimes we just don't
have the extra time to maybe take care
of ourselves or treat ourselves so what
I'm suggesting for you guys is to take a
night in for yourself no matter what you
have planned cancel your plans and just
do some of these steps to really refresh
yourself and make yourself feel better
so I'm gonna take you through some of my
favorite steps so if you want to see
what they are please keep watching
so to start our girls line in i
recommend treating yourself from the
inside out make a really fresh
nutritious smoothie and you're gonna
help start this process off really well
i'm gonna add some of my favorite fruit
in it feel free to use whatever flavors
that you guys like I chose strawberry
banana and make out because those ones
are my favorite but it's really
important to make sure you're treating
the inside as well as the outside I have
some frozen fruit in here and some
frozen yogurt I'm also going to be
adding a full banana I'm going to add a
little bit of fiber powder I'm not going
to use a full tablespoon just about a
half and then I'm going to add a scoop
of vanilla protein powder it's non-gmo
so next I'm going to add a little bit of
nonfat organic milk feel free to use
water or any dairy replacement in place
of this and I'm going to fill it up
about halfway
it's a better smoothie video than mine
that was in focus as well it was mm-hmm
next I'm going to do a do-it-yourself
face mask and hair mask so for those of
you guys on a budget you can just use
some things that you can find right in
your kitchen to create these first I'm
going to be making a papaya face mask
and this is really great for brightening
up your skin so I'm going to show you
guys a few steps and show you how easy
it is to create it so next up we're
going to move on to creating the face
mask so the first thing you're going to
want to do is cut the papaya and scoop
out all of the seeds so just using a
regular spoon I'm just going to start
scooping out all the seeds and just hang
them in this cup
okay so now that we've taken the seeds
out you're going to start scooping the
papaya and I'm going to mix it with my
food processor if you guys don't have
that I'm sure a blender would work just
as good or you can just take something
and start mashing it up to get it a nice
consistency so that's how much of the
papaya I'm going to use I'm going to eat
the rest of that so we don't let it go
to waste
the next step is to add one teaspoon of
plain yogurt and then also a teaspoon of
honey
so next I'm gonna make the banana
homemade hair mask it has potassium in
it which is going to be great for
damaged or dry hair it's also going to
have some vitamin A vitamin E and
vitamin C which is all really great for
your hair and your scalp and just to get
your hair nice and silky so first I'm
going to take two bananas and put them
into this Cup next I'm going to use 1
tablespoon of coconut oil 1 tablespoon
of olive oil and also one tablespoon of
honey
and again I'm just going to pour it into
a bowl so I could bring it upstairs
so I first washed my face I will link
below my nighttime routine that I
recently posted because I'm still using
the same face products but I just washed
all my makeup off so now let's put on
the mask I'm just using my clean hands
and I'm going to be rubbing it all over
my face it will have like a little bit
of a grainy texture so it's like an
exfoliating mask so it feels really
really nice on your skin moving on to
hair you just want to take it out of a
ponytail if it is in a ponytail of
course and you're going to start
applying it all throughout your hair
it's gonna smell really delicious but
feel really gross and slimy I ended up
getting it a little bit on my phone so
be careful you don't fling it everywhere
but what I like to do is put all my hair
down and then tie it up into a big bun
and that way to just sit there and soak
and I'm gonna leave my mask on for about
15 minutes but I'm going to leave my
hair mask on for at least an hour to get
it nice and soft
and then moving on to my favorite part
of the night we are going to take a nice
warm bubble bath but I was younger I
used to take baths all the time and just
recently I like to just get in get out
of shower and not really take my time so
for our girls night in I suggest taking
a nice long warm bubble bath with extra
bubbles of course because they're just
fun to play with when I take a tub I
love to dim the lights light some
candles play some on me up music I have
this awesome station that I listen to
all the time it just plays like spa
music just really soothing slow and just
helps you relax so during this time what
I want you guys to do is just free your
mind I don't want you thinking about
million next things that you have to do
just take the time for yourself and just
let it all go and relax take it easy
feel free to read a book during this
time or if you have maybe some apps on
your iPad or something that you want to
play with feel free to do that but just
be careful because we don't want any
accidents happening but that is
basically it if you guys want to do some
extra steps like doing your nails or
treating your nails feel free to add it
into your routine but I just wanted to
take you guys through the most important
steps of things that I like to do for a
girls night in but as I said earlier
please take the time for yourself
because we all deserve it we all work
really hard and it's nice to treat
yourself every once in a while and you
don't have to go out and spend a lot of
money or go to the spa to do it you can
do it right in your own home so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video
I beg you guys take the time for
yourself and really have a fun girl sign
in feel free to do it alone or with a
few girlfriends obviously we'll skip the
tub part if you're with your friends but
just take the time to pamper yourself
because you yes you deserve it alright
guys until next time I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
