just working against me
and gravity wants to bring me down hi
everybody thanks for watching in today's
video I'm going to show you how I got
this gold prom makeup look I had posted
a status on Facebook and a gold look was
definitely most requested I think a gold
makeup look can really go with a bunch
of different color dresses so that is
why I wanted to do this one first for
you guys I'm gonna try and grab my
friend Sam to bring her in a video this
week so I can do a prom makeup look for
brown eyes and also for someone with
smaller eyes because I know some of you
may have a little bit of trouble
recreating my looks because I do have
fairly large lids so I will be trying to
do that for you guys this week and I'm
wearing a tube top so don't think I have
nothing on under here also before I
started this look I contoured my face
and I filled in my brows I have about 4
or 5 different contour and highlighting
videos as well as how I do my brows oh I
will link all those below if anyone is
interested but if you want to learn how
to get this beautiful gold prom makeup
look please keep watching to start out
this look I'm going to be priming my
eyes with my Sigma pursuade eyeshadow
base and this is going to go all over
your eyelids
from my forever nude palette I'm picking
up the champagne color and I'm going to
be applying that on the inner part of my
eyelid I'm also going to be applying it
underneath my eyebrow and in the tear
duct of my eye next I'm using one of my
favorite Mac pigments this one is called
melon I'm dipping my brush first into my
charge water that way the pigment sticks
to the brush and it brings out the color
you can also use fix+
or eye drops in place of this
grabbing my larger blending brush and
this light brown color I'm then going to
be applying this right in the crease of
my eye you just want to very lightly
brush this into the crease and give it a
nice faded look
as usual I'm lining my upper lashline
with a gel black liner
next comes false lashes I'm using girl
you're crazy by the lore and these
lashes are amazing
to line my lower lashline I'm using this
gold eye pencil this one is by L'Oreal
and it's the h IP collection if you guys
have a gold eyeshadow that you prefer to
line your lower lash line with you can
do that instead but I really love how
pigmented this liner is before I
continue on I just wanted to let you
guys know if you aren't looking for
something super dramatic you can leave
it right here and be done with the look
to give it a really pretty gold finish
but if you want to do something a bit
more dramatic I'm going to continue on
the look and show you how I make it a
more dramatic eye grabbing my pencil
brush and these two darker colors I'm
then gonna start drawing in right where
my creases I like to look down and then
straight at the mirror that way I can
really see where my crease starts and
just start drawing a darker line right
there
picking up a little bit more shadow I'm
going to be filling in the outer V of my
eye once you get it as dark as you want
it then you're gonna grab a blending
brush and just blend out all the work
you just did
to fill in my lower inner lashline I'm
using this nude pencil
for blush I'm grabbing this peachy color
from my BH palette and I'm very lightly
applying this right onto my cheeks a
little bit goes a long way so if you
just lightly dust it you'll get the
perfect amount of color
I recently just picked up this new
highlighter and it's absolutely amazing
it's from Kiko cosmetics and I'm just
very lightly applying this right on my
cheeks right above where my blushes and
I'm just dabbing it on a drop in the
ocean a change in weather I was praying
that you and me might end up together
it's like a wishing for rain as I stand
in the desert but I'm holding you closer
than most for lipstick I'm using by Mac
it's called peach stock and it's a nude
color
I'm applying a little bit more of that
highlighter I used on my cheeks right on
my lips and also to highlight my Cupid's
bow if you don't love me puts in flowers
then it's time and then over that I'm
using my mute lipgloss by whitening
lightning
only used combs I wonder how capable
student this part is optional but I'm
just applying a little bit of my gold
loose glitter by BH right underneath my
lower lashline and on my lids most
nights I hardly sleep do so this is the
final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video for those of you that have
prom the next upcoming weekends I hope
you guys have a great time make sure to
be very safe and take tons of pictures
because I would love to see all of your
pictures from prom make sure to hashtag
Carly Bell so I could check out any of
you guys who recreate my looks and yeah
I think that's it for now but until next
time I'll see you guys later also bring
me down oh I never know
what makes this man with all the love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
