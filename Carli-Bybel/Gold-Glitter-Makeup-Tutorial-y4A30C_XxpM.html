in this tutorial I'll be showing you how
I got this gold sparkly look and it's
for the holidays first I'm going to be
taking my wet and wild fantasy makers
palette using this gold color the reason
I'm going to be applying this first on
my lid is so later when I use the gold
sparkles it's gonna stick to my lid and
not end up all over my face I'm then
taking a small shader brush and using
the same gold color on it so when I use
the glitter it will stick to the brush
as well using NYX gold glitter and this
is going to be going all over my eyelid
then using the Mack blending brush I'm
going to be taking this light brown
color and applying this right in the
crease of my eye blending it upwards
you're going to want to do to some small
circular motions next I'm going back to
the shader brush and I'm taking pearly
white color and applying this right
underneath my brow bone back to the Mac
blending brush I'm then going to be
taking with this other brown color and
applying this right over the same color
in the crease of my eye blending it
inwards
taking this mac brush I'm going to be
using a dark brown color and creating an
outer V in the crease of my eye this is
going to give my eye more depth going
back to the max blending brush I'm then
going to be blending this color into the
crease as well
using a black liquid eye pencil from
Jordana cosmetics I'm then going to be
lining my upper lash line
I always do this in sections that way
it's a lot easier to create a straight
line I like to keep my line very thin so
by doing it this way it also helps I'm
then gonna be lining my lower lashline
as well
from my Maybelline palette I'm gonna be
taking this pearly white color and
applying this right in the tear duct of
my eye just to open up my eye and
highlight it
I'm then taking a Mac angled brush and
this black eyeshadow and applying this
inside of my eye you could also use a
black eyeliner whichever you prefer
the reason I like using this is because
it does come out a lot darker
apply your mascara as you normally would
I'm using L'Oreal telescopic mascara in
black I'm then taking this Mac blush as
well as a Mac blush brush and applying
this right on the apples of my cheek I
just got this color and I'm so obsessed
with that I love it
apply your lip gloss I'm using Revlon
rose gold or rose on my lips
you
I think this look is perfect for the
holidays it's perfect whether you're
going out or just even having a night in
I love the glitter so you can also use
this for our New Year's Eve look thank
you so much for watching and I hope this
helped out a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
