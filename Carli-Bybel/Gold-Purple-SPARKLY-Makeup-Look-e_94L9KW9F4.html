your heart be like
Oh trouble to be outside hi everyone
thank you for watching so the holidays
are right around the corner can you even

year has flown by I wanted to get up a
bunch of holiday makeup looks for you
guys because it's been almost a month
since I posted my last makeup look so
this is going to be look number one
definitely let me know what kind of
looks you want to see for the holidays
what I was thinking was of course this
look maybe a gold sparkly look a black
and silver smokey eye look something
more dramatic definitely leave feedback
below because I love seeing what you
guys want to see next this makeup look
was definitely inspired by my new
earrings that I got from ludora boutique
and they're beautiful they have some
gold some purples in them and yeah so I
put them on and I was like you know what
I have to do a makeup look inspired by
this because to me the screams holiday
is with the glitter and everything like
that so I also wanted to announce a
little giveaway that I'm doing with
ludora boutique I've seen you guys
requesting a giveaway for quite some
time now so I will be listing all of the
rules below my other Amazon giveaway is
still going on I think it closes on
Wednesday so if you haven't checked that
one out please go do so now and if you
are interested in winning any ludora
boutique earrings check out the
description box below there's going to
be a total of three winners and three of
you get to pick two of your favorite
pairs from the website so if you guys
want to enter this giveaway definitely
check it out below and if you want to
learn how to get this beautiful holiday
inspired makeup look please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
using this eyeshadow base from Sigma
it's called awake and I'm going to be
applying this all over my entire eyelid
then I'm picking up this light pink
shadow and I'm applying it right over
the eyeshadow base
taking my mac blending brush in the
shimmery beige color I'm going to be
applying that right into the crease of
my eye and then blending it down onto my
lid
then I'm taking this gel liner by BH and
it's called bronze and it's this nice
gold color and I'm going to be lining my
lower lash line the reason I'm using
this gel liner is because later on when
I apply the glitter it's going to be a
lot easier to stick to
for my bareMinerals palette I'm picking
up this beautiful purple color and I'm
going to be applying that right on the
outer part of my crease and then
blending it in
following that I'm picking up this
darker plum color and this is going to
go on the outer V of my eye giving it
more dimension and more depth
to line my eyes I'm using the color onyx
and it's a gel liner with the brush and
I'm just going to be lining my upper
lash line as I normally would dragging
it out extending to give it a little
tail
For Lashes I'm using Bible or and I will
list which ones they are below but I
love these ones and I do have a 15% off
code which I will also list below in the
description box
whenever I finish my mascara I like to
take the darkest color and I'm going to
add in a little bit of this black and
just go over my outer V just because
once all the lashes and the mascara and
everything is on you can really see how
the final look is going to look and I
wanted to add a little bit of a darker
color in the crease
I'm using some loose gold glitter and I
like to dip my brush in the fixed plus
which is going to help the glitter stick
to the brush so it doesn't end up all
over my face a cheaper alternative as I
always mention is eye drops or the fix
plus
you
quick coffee break then on to the lips
I'm using Jordanna and Tony to line my
lips
to give my lips this really pretty gold
shimmering look I'm going to be applying
this pigment by Mac it's called melon
and I'm first applying this all over my
lips I had apply chapstick right before
this just to let it stay a little bit
easier and then right over that I'm
going to be using this light pink Mac
lip gloss
my favorite bronzer is the L'Oreal True
Match in cocoa so I'm just going to be
lightly contouring my face and since I
am pretty pale right now and it's winter
I only use a little bit of bronzer just
to add a little bit of a contour
for blush I'm mixing this light pink
along with this light purple color and
I'm going to be applying it all over my
cheeks
you
I just picked up this new highlight by
Mac it's called pearl and I just take a
little bit on my finger and I dab it on
right on my cheeks and it gives you that
really nice glowy look you can also use
a shimmery eyeshadow but I just got this
I wanted to try it out
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and definitely

me so I can see you guys recreate the
look remember to please leave feedback
