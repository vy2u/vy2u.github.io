you can see I have to transform myself
into a golden goddess and I wasn't sure
how exactly I was going to do my makeup
so I kind of just sat down and played
around for an hour and this is what I
came up with so there were a few
pictures that I saw online that I was
inspired by I will link them below if
you guys want to see them also this
costume that I'm wearing it came with
these gold armbands and this little gold
headpiece so these you can get for like
40% off I'll link the costume below in
the description box so yeah if you want
to see how I created this look please
keep watching to start off this look I'm
going to be using Mac strobe cream and
I'm applying it all over my face for
foundation I'm using my Chanel
foundation along with my million-dollar
tan shade upgrade to give me a nice tan
I had applied self-tanner on my body
before I film this tutorial so that's
why I like to include this in my
foundation then I'm using these Mac
lustre jobs they have this really pretty
gold finish to them
next I'm contouring my nose
to fill my brows I'm using the darker
shade of the brow bar to go
moving on to eyes I'm using my flash
palette I'm using that Sam gold color
that I use in my previous tutorial and
this is going all over my eyelid using
my pencil brush and the black color in
the flash palette I'm then going to
start drawing out the wing of my eye
once you have them even you can start
blending it up and this is just going to
give my eyes a really dramatic look so I
am taking the black color adding a
little bit more on and just kind of
thickening out this line
then with a blending brush and this
light brown color from my to face
palette I'm blending this right on the
line and blending it upwards don't worry
if the line gets too thick because with
a little swipe of a makeup wipe you can
just clean that right up
and you just repeat the same steps on
the opposite I the key is to have it all
blended so it's going to give it a nice
a gradient effect and it's not going to
be such sharp lines that way from far
away it's going to give your eyes a
really dramatic look
grabbing my black gel liner I'm going to
start drawing the inner corner of my eye
this part take your time with I'm just
extending my line
out onto the contours of my nose it took
me a little bit of time to get it right
but just take your time with it and it
mess up don't worry we can use makeup
wipe that is what they are there for
then using my pencil brush and that same
brown color I'm going to start coloring
in the inner part of my eye just again
to give it a nice blended look like what
we see on the outside again I had a
little bit of trouble with this so just
take it slow take your time with it and
you'll get it perfect
so keep blending until you feel
comfortable I'm next applying my lashes
and then I went back to blending it out
I probably should have left it right
here but I wanted it darker so I'm going
back with that same eyeliner and just
extending it a little bit darker then
I'm going back to the blending brush and
doing the same steps just to make it
look nice and blended
grabbing the darker shade in that same
toothpaste palette I'm then using a
bigger blending brush and blending it in
my crease then using my Kiko shadow in
the color 208 I'm applying that right
underneath my brows just to give it a
nice highlight grabbing my smaller
blending brush in the same darker shade
I'm just going to darken up in the
crease
moving up to concealer I'm applying it
with this amazing new 3d brush from
Sigma I originally was just gonna apply
the concealer with this and then use my
Beauty Blender but the way that it's
shaped that has like sharper edges on it
it makes doing your concealer so easy
without messing up all the work that
I've done so I'm just blending in my
concealer highlighting where I would
normally highlight I'm just applying a
little extra than normal because it is
Halloween and we really want our skin to
look nice and glowy
then grabbing my Beauty Blender I'm just
gonna blend in around the edges to give
it a nice smooth look
next with the darkest shade in my
contour palette I'm going to be
contouring my cheeks around my forehead
under my chin and a little more on the
sides of my nose so here marks the point
where I try to transform myself into
literally pure gold so I was trying to
get the most pigmented shadow so I just
used a whole mixture until my skin was
gold enough so first I use the Kiko
shadow all over my face with the contour
brush then with this foundation brush I
use the gold shade from my flash palette
to give it a nice golden look then since
I forgot I'm applying a little bit of
the banana powder under my eyes just to
set my concealer so we don't get all
Creasy next I'm applying this really
pretty bronzy self-tanner stuff from
hard candy it's not a self-tanner it
kind of just gives your skin a nice
golden glow so after that I am applying
the same Kiko shadow with that contour
brush all over my chest and neck area
using the dark brown shadow from my brow
bar to go I'm then aligning under my
eyes a little bit just to give it a more
dramatic effect moving on to the lips
I'm using this Mac pencil I believe it's
called boldly bare I'll double check for
you guys and then for lipstick I'm using
this nude lipstick by Gerard cosmetics
applying a little bit of that gold shade
from my flash palette also on my lips to
give it a nice golden glow as well I
didn't want to do full gold lips just
because I wanted to look a little bit
more natural and wearable
yeah wearable although I look crazy and
I've so many layers already but it's
Halloween remember and you want to look
like a golden goddess so we have to do
as many layers as it takes pics I'm
grabbing this Becca highlighter in this
really goldish color and that's gonna
really add a nice golden glow right to
my highlight when I was looking for
rhinestones I found this little
rhinestone sticker in my draw so I'm
gonna be applying two of these on either
sides of my forehead then moving on to
hair I'm going to do a nice slicked back
look so I'm just using some hairspray
and the smoothing brush to just get it
nice and slicked back
once you get it just how you want it
then apply the little crown that comes
with a costume they come with these
little clips so they just clip right
onto your hair so it's super easy next
I'm applying this glitter this is craft
glitter that I got from Michaels and at
first I was using eyelash glue to make
it stick but then I realized I can just
spray some hairspray and I will do the
same trick so I'm just applying this on
my cheeks on my neck and I'm also going
to apply it along my hairline
and then adding a little bit of a peach
colored blush just to add a little bit
of color on to my cheeks then to top it
all off you just want to spray the
hairspray so all the glitter stays and I
actually went back and wanted to put
some rhinestones along these lines just
to make it a little bit more fun and I'm
just using little rhinestones that are
actually stickers so they just stick
right on so this is the final result I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I just
wanted to say thank you guys so much I
hit 2 million subscribers I think it was
two days ago now and I'm just so blown
away I love you guys so much and until
next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
