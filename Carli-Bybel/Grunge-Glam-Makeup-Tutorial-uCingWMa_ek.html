today's video I'm going to teach you how
i got this makeup look i like to call
this grungy glam and i think it's
perfect for the holidays it's a nice
dramatic look incorporating some deep
Browns a nice smokey eye and a little
bit of glitter so if you guys want to
learn how I got this look please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
going to be priming my eyes with this
Rimmel scandaleyes stay liquid a texture
so you can just blend it in with a brush
on top of that I'm using by makeup geek
this pigment in the color nightlife and
I'm applying that all over my lid
picking up this bright orange shadow
with a large blending brush I'm going to
be blending that right into my crease
picking up this brown shade with a
smaller blending brush I'm then blending
that right into the bottom part of my
crease blending it up into the orange
and also down into my lid to give it a
really pretty faded look next moving on
to lashes I'm using the one that I
helped design from velour lashes I'm so
excited about it and I will be doing a
video letting you guys know the date
that it will be available but these are
the lashes that I am using in this video
they're really wispy and full and I just
absolutely love them so I'm applying my
L'Oreal telescopic mascara over that and
then I'm following that by grabbing a
black eyeliner and drawing it in the
lower lash line picking up a little bit
of my black gel liner I am then lining
underneath my eye really close to my
lash line to just give it a really smoky
look this whole grunge look that's
really in right now always has a nice
smoked out bottom lash line so I'm going
to start it with this black liner and
then I'm gonna have it fade into the
brown and then also fade into that
orange so next with a pencil brush
I'm grabbing that same orange color and
I am drawing right under my eyes with
this pencil brush following that I'm
grabbing the makeup geek shadow that
brown color and I'm putting it right in
between the orange and the black and
it's gonna give it a really really
pretty faded look I'm picking up a matte
black shadow and I'm applying this right
on the outer V of my eye just to really
darken it a bit
moving out to the glitter I'm dipping my
brush in mac fix+ first and then I'm
using this dark brown glitter and I'm
applying it all over my lids
to highlight under my brow using this
white matte shade from the forever new
palette as well
was
you can't not dance and sing when Taylor
comes on Kosh I love her anyway I am
using this nude pencil by NYX to line my
lips
for lipstick I'm using this beautiful
color called buttercup by Gerard
cosmetics and I'm going back to my lip
liner and I'm just gonna kind of fill it
in to give a nice blended look for blush
I'm using this bright pink color from
Sigma
and to highlight I'm using this new
highlighter from Bobby Brown and I'm
using my fingers to apply it and you
just want to apply it right above where
your blush when right on your cheekbones
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and until next
time I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
