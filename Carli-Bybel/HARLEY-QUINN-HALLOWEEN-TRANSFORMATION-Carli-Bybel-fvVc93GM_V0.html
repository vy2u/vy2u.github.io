how to get this Harlequin inspired
makeup look I am obsessed with the movie
and I knew I wanted to do Harley Quinn
for about two months now so I've been
gathering the pieces of the outfit and
today's finally the day so if you guys
want to see how I got this look right
here then please keep watching start off
today's look I'm using a blurring primer
to smooth out my face next up I'm
picking up the fenty Beauty Foundation
and the number 140 for this look you
want to use a foundation shade a couple
shades lighter that way your face looks
super pale for concealer I'm using the
medium number 30 concealer by color pop
this is actually a little bit darker
than my foundation but it's fine I'm
gonna pick up a gray toned contour shade
to contour my face and my hos a little
bit so I know she's like very pale but
I'm gonna contour a little bit and it'll
lighten it well
I'm gonna apply a little bit more
concealer on the sides of my nose just
to help blend the contour out which
probably will be super easy because it's
not as dark as I would normally go
normally it's a very very dark color so
I always apply the concealer to help it
blend but this should be easy
we're gonna use a super white setting
powder underneath our eyes to set the
concealer so while my concealer is
setting I'm gonna do my brows so now
we're going to whip away the powder just
by a little bit of a setting spray to
soak in its when we should Jeff so for
shadows today I'm using my custom
palette that I created from buxom they
have 40 different shades which I got
basically all of them and I custom
created my own palette isn't this
palette look like a unicorn I love it so
obviously I'm only gonna be using the
Blues out of this palette and I'm also
gonna be using like a black shade but I
had a little fun creating this palette
so it ended up looking like this but
I'll just use this one as well so I'll
kind of talk you guys through it so
these shadows are primer infused which
means you don't need an eyeshadow primer
to apply them so that's perfect for me
because I usually skip the primer anyway
these shadows are super pigmented so I'm
gonna go in with a clean blending brush
that I'm gonna start with this blue
shade and I'm going to apply it to think
it's her left side his blue let me check
so we're gonna just start off with a
little bit and I'm going to start
applying that may actually smooth out
these little crease
I got first so I barely touched it you
guys can see how pigmented it already is
I want to keep it pretty light at first
and then I will be building it so we're
gonna focus it mostly on the outer half
and I wanted to do a look very similar
to the movie so we're gonna make it look
like smeared down with the face so we're
just gonna start dragging it down make
it look like it's smeared I'm gonna
actually grab a smaller brush and I'm
gonna just add some smear marks and I'm
gonna grab a little bit of this darker
sharp blue as well and I'm gonna focus
up first on the outer B I'm gonna drag
that down as well
so next I'm gonna go in with the shade
it's called LBD and I'm gonna go over
this again to kind of darken it up here
and then I'm gonna go back with this
brush and just kind of blend it all
picking up a little bit of the color
diamond darling I'm going to apply that
under my brows I'm also going to apply
that my tear duct and I'm gonna drive a
little bit on to the lid I wasn't going
to why not
so now that that's on the lid we're just
gonna grab our blending brush and just
kind of blend the lid in with the blue
and I'm gonna grab a little bit more of
LBD and go over so I couldn't find my
close-up lens so apologies if it's not
as close up as normal and I cut out
looks so with a clean fluffy brush I'm
just gonna go over the edges just to
make sure nothing looks too harsh
and for red I was looking through my
collection and it's so hard to find a
red eyeshadow so I had already picked
out my lipstick for today's look which
is the toxic cherry matte lipstick also
by buxom so I'm going to show you guys
how to use a lipstick as an eyeshadow
because majority of you guys probably
don't have it a red eyeshadow like
bright red at least so I'm just going to
apply a little bit on the back of my
hand like this I'm going to take my
concealer eyeshadow brush and I'm going
to start applying it again I'm gonna
start applying it right on the outer V
cool right
this is literally like the perfect red
to do this look cause it almost looks
like a little bit of a pink undertone
which hers kind of has that pinkish look
so first I'm gonna apply it with this
brush and then I'm gonna go in with my
blending brush but I'm gonna do kind of
the same thing with the drips and they
don't need to be perfect because she was
kicking some ass and it just kind of
naturally happened
so now we're going to go in with a clean
blending brush and we're just going to
blend the edges out
and then to do the smaller ones I'm
going to use a smaller pencil brush to
blend because I don't want to make them
any thicker
you
I'm gonna go back in with the diamond
darling shade make to your duct and
these shadows are super pigments that
I'm like barely touching we're gonna
just drag this into the inner half of my
eyelid and just kind of slowly blend
that into the red
I'm going to take a little bit of little
black dress or LBD again I'm just gonna
do a tiny bit in the red just to add a
little bit of dimension
so next we're going to go in with a
black eyeliner
and I'm going to take like a regular
eyeliner I'm going to line my lower
lashline and I'm also going to smudge it
like down on my lower lashline and then
I'm going to use the shadow just to give
it like a more grunge type of look I'm
just like we looked up the picture
friend I feel like I should use white
eyeliner in and then the black on the
bottom so I'm just gonna wipe it off my
inner
for lashes i'm using the WSP lashes for
mascara I'm using my favorite mascara
which I'm actually almost out of its the
buxom lash mascara so I bought these
tattoos from Hot Topic
they are the Harlequin tattoos obviously
so you guys can draw on the heart and
the rotten on their face if you want but
I'm gonna just use the tattoos because I
have them runs big maybe I won't use it
because it's too big so I'm going to
draw them on with some liquid eyeliner
so first we're gonna do the heart I hope
that this was working
tell me on the one picture I was looking
at it was on the blue side and now the
other ones I'm looking at is on the
right side I guess we'll just leave it
oh well close enough
hey now I'm going to do a little bottom
a cetera and by a little I mean a lot
I'm gonna take the diamond darling and
I'm gonna highlight my nose just a
little bit because I contoured for lips
I'm using also by buxom the plump line
the lipliner and the color code red
and then for lipstick I'm using the
buxom bold gel lipstick in toxic cherry
these lipsticks are super pigmented and
they come in both matte and satin finish
I'm using the matte one today and it's
like the perfect red for this look I
love how creamy it feels sometimes matte
lipsticks can be a little bit drying so
I've been preferring actual matte
lipsticks over the liquid lipstick as of
lately so I'm gonna go put on the wig
get dressed and then finish up the
makeup look I don't know how much more
I'm gonna do but I'm gonna put on the
wig and then kind of see how I feel so
be right back like this wig might be
glued on for a long time I use like this
new twig glue Hey so I'm gonna put on
the accessories I'll link where I got
everything from this little guy
I'm gonna make it a little bit more
grungy I'm gonna grab the color hot or
yacht by buxom it's like a gray tone and
I'm just gonna go under my eyes to add
like a little bit of shadow feel like it
looks too neat
and I'm gonna do the smear look
this lip liner actually comes with like
a little brush on the bottom so I'm
gonna take a little bit of the lipstick
I'm just gonna add a little bit more of
this color just to make a little dirty
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you're going
out for Halloween this weekend make sure
to be safe don't need too much candy and
until next time I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
