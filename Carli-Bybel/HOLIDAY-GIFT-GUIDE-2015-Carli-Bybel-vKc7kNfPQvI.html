finally back with another video for you
guys thank you for being with me during
this a very hectic time we are not
officially in the new house I'm still in
my older room obviously it may look like
I haven't packed anything because my
background is still the same but all
around me is just chaos
we basically packed almost everything
and we packed a lot of stuff up and we
slowly brought stuff over on our own but
we do plan on having the big moving
truck come to get all of our larger
stuff probably next week before
Christmas which I can't even believe
Christmas is next week and already it's
just very very weird which means it's
almost New Year's which means it's
almost 2016 which means it's almost
January so I don't even know where the
time has gone it has been flying by and
with all the moving and all the packing
and all that it kind of just went even
quicker I did start a vlog yesterday
we've logged a little bit of our
experience I showed you some of the new
stuff that I got for the house also my
beauty room so I will have that video up
probably at the end of the week because
I don't think I have enough footage to
make just yesterday a vlog so I figured
I'd kind of combine a few days in one
for you guys so today I wanted to talk
about some holiday gifts ideas I have a
lot of great ideas for you guys some
last-minute ideas some cheap affordable
options as well as some higher-end
options so if you guys want to see some
of my holiday gift options please keep
watching so first I'm gonna start out
with the gifts that cause basically
nothing to a little amount of money and
then I'm gonna work my way up one thing
I always did when I was a lot younger
and I didn't have the money for holidays
was I would try to find different ways
to create my own gifts just using some
items that I have in my own house or
just kind of thinking of something in my
head the number one thing that we always
used to do me and my sister and I think
my parents liked it I mean I don't know
we would make coupon books so we would
go on the computer we would go on like
word and create like a cute little
coupon and we'd write in like good for
one back massage or good for one movie
date or something like that so you can
create two types of coupons you can
create one that is good for like a back
rub or something that doesn't require
money or you can do a coupon for say a
movie date or a dinner day and it's just
a cute way it's a kind of
give a different type of gifts instead
of giving just like a gift card a Visa
gift card to go out to dinner or
something like that so you can really
customize it depending on who you are
doing it for if it's for a girlfriend or
boyfriend maybe you could do a coupon
like good for one home-cooked dinner at
any time you want and the way that that
works is it could be any day any time
they just give you that coupon and then
you gotta cash it in so I think that's a
really cute idea there's a million
different things that you can do you
guys know who you're buying the gift for
so you know what they would appreciate
and what they would like so I think that
was a fun little idea that I wanted to
share with you guys for those of you on
a budget it's a perfect option and you
make it at home
on your own computer gift option number
two is a step book scrapbooks have not
been around for a while because now with
social media and Facebook and Instagram
and all that stuff you don't usually get
pictures printed when I was growing up
we would have disposable cameras it's
naughty to say like when I was growing
up as if it was so long ago and it's so
different but it's so funny how much has
really changed in the past 15 20 years
but um so as I was saying when we grew
up we used disposable camera so if we
wanted to see what the pictures looked
like we would have to drop them off wait
like a couple days and then go pick them
up at Walgreens so one year for the
holidays um actually for my ex-boyfriend
we don't need to tell Brett I made a
scrapbook so I had one I printed out a
bunch of pictures I went to Michaels and
I got a couple like cute stickers and
stuff like that and I just made a
scrapbook of different pictures one
thing I always do I keep like movie
stubs
I keep airplane tickets I keep room keys
if we're staying at a hotel or something
like that so just little things that
remind you that person you can kind of
include in that scrapbook and I think
it's a really amazing idea because
nowadays if we want to look at pictures
it's only on the computer or online
where for me I like having something
right in my hand I like being able to
actually like physically touch it and
look through it so I think that would be
a really really cool idea as well you
guys can go out and get printer paper
and print out the pictures yourself or
you can go and drop it off to get the
pictures printed I think you can even
upload your pictures online at like
Walgreens CVS Walmart and then they
could print it directly for you and then
again you can go find maybe some
stickers or some scrapbook stuff at like
Michaels or a supply store or something
like that
obviously this gift is not gonna cost
nothing it's gonna cost a little bit
more but I think the thought and the
love and the energy that you put into it
will mean so much more than maybe some
other gift so as I said you guys know
who you're buying this for so you know
what that person would like and
appreciate so keep in mind a scrapbook
may not be for everybody but I just
wanted to give you guys as many ideas as
possible the next gift I actually talked
about in one of my favorites videos I
just love the idea of it and it can be a
do-it-yourself project as well it
doesn't need to be something that you
actually need to go out and purchase
this is like a little jar with some
positive notes in them so I talked about
this a few months ago and then I also
created my own jar a couple years ago
and inside are little notes with
positive affirmations on them so this is
something you can really do by yourself
you cut up little pieces of paper just
need to get a little jar and then you
can either write different positive
things down positive quotes or you can
give someone like an empty jar with a
bunch of little papers and you let them
know that each time that they have
something positive or something amazing
that happens in their lives that they
can write it down put it in the jar and
then at the end of the year or by next
holiday they can open it up and then
they can see all the amazing positive
things that had happened to them the
previous year it's really easy to forget
a lot of the good things that happen
sometimes of course we have bad times
that overcome the positive and kind of
puts us in a dark place and we kind of
forget the good things that happen so I
think this idea is really awesome to
remind ourselves the positive things in
life and then to just remind yourself
that though there are really hard times
there are still really good things that
happen as well so I think that's a
really cute do-it-yourself idea as well
I will link where I got that jar if you
guys want to actually buy it
she has different positive quotes in
there so I thought that was really
really nice I actually got that as a
birthday gift so I just wanted to share
that with you guys as well so the next
gift I wanted to mention is super
affordable so of course I had to mention
can you guess what it is
my Carli bybel palette it is still on
sale for only 1250 it was out of stock
over the weekend but thank God that it's
back in stock because when I saw that
one out of stock it said it wasn't gonna
be back till January and I was like oh
no the holidays are right around the
corner we can't have this happening so I
called them got it back in stock thank
goodness so anyone who is interested in
my palette it is still currently only
$12.50 if you guys want to see swatches
if you guys want to see more looks
created with this palette I have so many
videos up I will link them all for you
guys but this I think is the most
perfect palette every one that I had
given one too it's absolutely loving it
they say they use it every day because
it's a perfect mixture of everyday
colors and more dramatic colors
highlighters it has it all so again it's
only 1250 go check it out I will link
everything below for you guys so the
next products I didn't realise but I
actually packed away but the whole brand
is super affordable so I wanted to
mention it and then talk about some of
my favorite products so these are some
colourpop lip liners and eyeliners I am
obsessed with their liquid lipsticks I
did pack up all my liquid lipsticks all
of them except maybe like 6 or 7 that I
wear all the time they came out with a
little holiday set with mini sized
liquid lipsticks which is awesome I will
link everything for you guys I also have
a $5 off coupon if you use my direct
link to color pot so they have the most
amazing products all under like $10 I
love their blushes I love their
eyeshadows the liquid lipsticks the
liners are really great as well
so if you guys haven't checked out any
of these color pot products you need to
check them out and they're perfect gift
ideas they're great stocking stuffers
they're super affordable which is also
really nice so you can get maybe a
couple more than you would if you were
picking out something a little bit more
higher-end but I love the color pop I
love all of their products I will link
some of my favorites below for you guys
to check out the next two products I
wanted to mention I actually just
recently purchased from Nordstrom I took
my nails off about 4 weeks ago and I
wanted to give them a break I also
looked into regular nail polishes and I
saw how much chemicals were in them and
how bad they were and how much it can
affect your health so I was like oh
that's nice because now I have about 100
different colored nail polishes and they
all have harmful chemicals in them so I
just figured I would buy these two
little gift sets that they had for the
holidays the sets are by deborah
lippmann and the first one is called
cuticle lab it's intensive cuticle
treatment and it's a
five dollar value kit but you only get
it for $45 for the holidays it comes
with a cuticle remover a cuticle pusher
cuticle oil and cuticle Repair Cream so
I have been doing this every couple of
nights because my nails have been in
really really bad shape since I've had
the gel on them so I thought these were
really good holiday gift ideas because
they come as little kits and I also
picked up this little sample set of a
couple of these pretty nude shades that
are also vegan and nail polishes I read
up that these were a lot more healthy
for you compared to some of the other
products out there and to be honest I
only ever wear like nudes or Pink's or
beiges or stuff like that so this was
kind of a perfect little set for me and
it's also smaller size bottles than
normal and I never go through a full
bottle of nail polish so that's why I
thought it was like a really cool gift
idea and this cost $34 when it normally
has a $72 value as well so I wanted to
talk to you guys about that look into
what you're using on your body I know
makeup is so toxic and it has a lot of
chemicals in it and maybe I need to
start looking into that a little bit
more which I do plan on doing a lot but
I'm starting with some of the other
products and then I'm going to work my
way to makeup um makeups just really
hard there's so much of it so do you
need to research that a little bit more
but as far as nail polishes I'm only
gonna stick with polishes like this for
now so like I said earlier I did pack up
most of all of my makeup I did keep
these purposely out because they're
amazing they're a Nastasia liquid
lipsticks so you can see this was full
but I only kept the ones that I thought
that I would need before I move I used
the burgundy Mac lip liner and then I
used Americans all liquid lipstick so
these liquid lipsticks are amazing I
love the color range that they have in
them anasazi a Beverly Hills her
products are just amazing I also love
her contour kit or highlighters on my
nose highlight right now I have my gold
eyeshadow shade from my Carli bybel
palette and then I have so Hollywood
also by uh Nastasia over that so if you
guys are looking for any amazing on
Stasia products I will list below my top
top favorites but definitely the liquid
lipsticks the highlighter and then the
get or I must have and if you buy that
for anybody you know they will be
jumping up and down because everybody
wants something from my Anasazi Beverly
Hills so the neck is brand and products
I'm going to talk about are by morphe I
love the morphe brushes I can list which
ones are my favorite for those of you
guys who want to buy me the individual
brushes but they also came out with
these new mini kits which I think are
perfect stocking stuffers let's see it
which each one is so this one right here
is a highlight powder kit so it has
different highlight shades this is the
0-6
PC so the next one is an eyeshadow
palette that has a bunch of bright
colors this one is the 12 P then we have
12 s which is definitely my favorite
it's all shimmery colors neutrals
there's a plum shade a little bit of
like a blue shade but it's just
absolutely beautiful I love this one and
then the last mini one is the contour
shades which have all of the darker
shades the cool the warmer tones morphe
is super affordable I do have a 10% off
code which is Karli so you guys can
apply that at checkout for a little bit
of a discount there are a lot of other
morphe products that i love like the
bigger eyeshadow kits I did use a few of
them in my most recent videos so again
check out the morphe brushes check out
the morphe palettes they're great
stocking stuffers they're great gift
ideas and of course they're affordable
so you can't be so I actually had some
more holiday gift sets to show you that
I guess ended up being moved to my new
place I had a big suitcase and I was
putting a lot of makeup and stuff in
there so two other brands that I wanted
to mention that I don't have on me right
now but they have amazing holiday kits
that I'm obsessed with
there's Tarte cosmetics that have a
bunch of different holiday kits that I
will link for you guys to check out they
have different blushes different
eyeshadow kits they are amazing I
absolutely love them and then also by
Too Faced these products you can find it
Sephora I believe you can find them at
Ulta I will link everything for you guys
but I love during the holidays how they
come out with different blush palettes
with like six or eight in there where
you can really try all of them without
having
money on buying individuals so the next
friend I wanted to talk about is jarred
cosmetics I have a few bundles with them
that will save you a ton of money
so the first bundle is a Hydra liquid
lipstick a gold lipstick and then a
Bratz bar to go I use the brow bar to go
literally every single day I've gone
through probably like 15 of them in my
entire life the gold bullet lipsticks
they come in so many different colors
you can pick any color that you want and
the same thing with the Hydra lipsticks
this one is ecstasy I love this one I
love the color invasion those are
definitely my two favorites and the
second bundle that I have for you guys
is a liquid lipstick a gold bullet
lipstick and then either a regular color
your smile lipstick lip gloss or they
have these new creamy lip glosses which
are amazing this one's my favorite
it's called blooming hibiscus and it's
just such a gorgeous color if anyone is
in the market for amazing stud earrings
I literally wear them every single day I
have all of the ones on her website it's
Princess Pea jewelry which you guys have
heard me mentioned forever I personally
love the studs they look like real
diamonds every time I wear members like
are they real and obviously I tell them
no but they're just so gorgeous I also
love her dainty necklaces she also has
beautiful rings and bracelets if anyone
is looking for some amazing jewelry you
can check out her site as well so if you
guys are in the market for hair
extensions I 100% back up Bellamy they
are the best hands down my favorite
extensions if I were to be buying them
for a friend are the 220 grams
22 inch the Lily hair or the new Bugatti
if I had to pick one favorite it would
definitely be the Lily hair it just
works best for my type of hair because
my hair so thick I'm actually not
wearing extensions this is all my hair
now so I have kind of been staying away
from the extensions just for now because
I don't really need them if I do go out
and I have like an extravagant event
that I have to go to I'll have maybe one
or two checks to add a little bit of
thickness but the curling wand is also
an amazing gift that you guys can get
this one is running the new 12 in one
set which is 12 different curling wands
in one which is just unreal this is what
I use all the time to curl my hair they
also have a six in one car
which I was using before this one came
out so they're both amazing if you are
in the market for a curling wand do not
go and spend your money on any other
brand because I've tried literally every
single one and they've all broken and
I've had to throw away so many of them
so next I'm gonna talk about a couple of
large gifts if you guys have a little
extra money that you guys want to spend
for the holidays here are some things
that I personally love that I recommend
the first is this Chanel perfume this is
called chance by Chanel and it's so
beautiful I actually recently picked
this up I've used it maybe three or four
times and I love the smell of it but I
love the smell of it as well so of
course it's a little bit more pricey but
everyone uses perfume so if you get it I
feel like that's a gift that people will
use all the time it doesn't have to be
Chanel it could be a different brand
just go to the counter take a little
width of each one and see which one that
you like the best but I just personally
love the chance by Chanel right now the
next large item is my favorite camera
that currently has this little thing
stuck in it this is the sony a 5100 it
has the flip up screen and if you want
to take the best selfies in the world
this is the camera for you this is I
think around 500 maybe $600 so it is
very very expensive but it is worth it I
use this all the time I know a lot of
the other makeup girls online use the
same camera it's amazing it's just
really really good at capturing your
work for the longest time I would use my
cell phone to take pictures and I would
take hours to get ready and no matter
how many pictures I would take it just
never captured my makeup well so when
you got a camera like this it really
really emphasizes your makeup and shows
your skill so I think if you are looking
for a camera this year this is the one
to ask for I use this also to vlog so
this camera is definitely my favorite
and then last but not least if you guys
have some extra money after you spend
your gifts on everybody else and you
feel that you personally deserve
something for yourself or for the guys
out there maybe watching this for your
girlfriends this purse I got right here
this is st. Laurent I got this from the
online site Lisa
their aroma I think I'm saying that
right but they have the cutest purses
ever I think this little purse right
here was about a thousand dollars which
is a lot of money I know it's very very
expensive but for this brand it was
actually the most affordable one that
they had on the site unless you wanted
like a really really small one but this
is a really nice-sized clutch it's big
you could fit a lot in here I didn't
even take the packaging out or anything
but you couldn't really fit like your
cell phone make up your money your
credit cards all that stuff in here
which is so cool I have a black and gold
Saint Laurent purse it has like the
little gold fringe it's a little bit
smaller and I wanted something a little
bit bigger because I couldn't fit much
in it but if any of you guys are looking
for amazing designer purses you guys
have to check out this website I will
link it for you guys they have the best
stuff ever and we're gonna happy with my
graduates after I don't look cute with
this outfit like a pair pants and then
this you can't measure a gift by the
price tag it's all about the thought and
the love and the energy that you put
into it so whether you want to spend $0
and make a cute little coupon book or if
you want to spend a little bit more and
get a nice splurge gift that's all up to
you any gift that you decide to give
will be amazing and I'm sure the person
will absolutely love it so there are a
million other gifts ideas that I didn't
mention some just off the top of my head
that I've done in the past of course you
can do like gift cards if you know
someone is moving into new house okay
Amy
I've gotten a couple home goods gift
cards at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and those
100% be used so I think those are the
typical gifts that you don't need me to
sit here and tell you about but I wanted
to talk about some of my favorite makeup
product some little bundles that you
guys can get for the holidays and yeah
so I hope you guys enjoyed that video
like I said I will have a blog coming
for you guys this week as well thank you
all for being so patient with me during
this crazy move but once I'm settled I
am settled for good I am NOT going
anywhere and I can't wait to really get
back in the swing of things I'm have a
ton of alpha post coming a ton of makeup
videos and so many different exciting
things prepared for you guys in 2016 so
I love you guys so much thank you for
watching I hope you enjoyed have an
amazing week and until next time I will
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
