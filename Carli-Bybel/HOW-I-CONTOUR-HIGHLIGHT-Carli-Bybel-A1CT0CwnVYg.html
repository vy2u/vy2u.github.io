here today to show you my full contour
and highlight routine I feel like it's
been a little bit since I've done a full
face look let alone talk through each
step and why I do each step so I wanted
to film that for you guys today I film
this exact video for you guys yesterday
but I guess because mercury is in
retrograde it decided to delete all of
my files and info and 800 files off of
my memory card so I am having a job
because I'm in the same exact outfit and
I read some the same video but I wanted
to get this one up for you guys because
I know it's been a while and I'm sure a
lot of you guys want to see my routine
and why I do certain steps so if you
want to see how I got this look right
here then please keep watching so I
never do what salt face routine without
a primer to start off I'm using the
Becca velvet blurring primer and I'm
going to be applying that all over my
face and a downwards motion for
foundation I'm using with Leona styles
luminous foundation on mixing numbers 5
and 6
I already applied some of my Vita
Liberata body blur that's why my body is
Tanner than my face so whenever I apply
this I always like to do my body first
and then I'll match my face to my CEO as
I've mentioned a couple times I did
prefer the matte finish but since I'll
be using a lot of powder and stuff like
that it's ok because it ends up looking
more matte hopefully she comes back with
the matte
I shouldn't have put my earrings on
first cuz I have to do my ear but Alda
sees a wipe oops
so I film this entire video yesterday
and I had posted about it this has never
happened before I had about 800 files on
my memory card because it's really
really expensive big one so it holds a
lot of files and I'm just like I hate
deleting things and just like keeping
them on the card just knowing that I
have them makes me feel good and I had
imported the photos that I took
yesterday posted one to them on
Instagram I exported my memory card as I
normally do and I put it into my laptop
because I like editing on my laptop and
when I put it into my laptop and I tried
to import the footage there was nothing
on the card so I was like okay I've
restarted my laptop I figured it was
something wrong with my laptop we
started it and when I restarted it again
same thing so I brought my memory card
back down to my main computer and
everything was just deleted like
everything all the photos all the videos
I had a minor panic attack and pulled on
I'm using the it cosmetics bye bye
breakout I've been using this just on
any pimples that I have and this is in
the color tan makes me feel better
knowing that there's like anti acne
treatment in here so yeah when I put it
back on my main computer again
everything was gone so I downloaded
three different software recovery
programs none of them worked and yeah I
mean I lost a lot of good footage I mean
a lot of it was are all edited and I
have videos up on YouTube so I was just
like you know what I'm just gonna film
it so here we are take two hopefully
this one will be even better than last
time so you know it's okay I'm gonna
blame mercury in retrograde for the
issues because I dropped my phone and it
completely shattered I have something on
the back of it
I don't you guys can see it completely
shout out the night before so yeah it's
just when mercury is in retrograde they
say like technology and all kinds of
 goes crazy so I'm gonna blame that
and we're gonna move on so moving on to
a cream contour one of my favorite
products that I've used for a while is
the graftobian warm palette number three
it's the high def glamour cream palette
it comes like this I do believe you can
buy individuals of each one but I really
only use these to darkest ones so it's
really all about preference depending on
if it's your first time or not you want
to try some new colors the darkest color
is called Sienna and the other color is
burnt amber I'm gonna take Sienna don't
be afraid to use a dark color to contour
either because it'll all blend out as
long as you do it enough so I always
like to contour the tip of my nose
depending on your nose shape you're
gonna want to make me look up different
no shapes to see where you should be
contouring obviously if you follow what
I'm doing it might not work for you
because we have different noses but I
found what works best for me I like to
make it look more narrow and also more
uplifted at the tip so I contour the tip
and then I draw as you guys can see
where my nose ends it's more on the
right side and then I have like a little
bit of a bump right here so it kind of
like goes out even more I don't know if
you guys can tell so I like to bring
those lines much closer together
and then I also drag it up a little bit
I mean I sometimes use eyeshadow but I
like to bring it up like that
when I'm doing like a full glam full
dramatic look I always like to cream
contour and then use a powder contour
over I just feel like it stays longer
and it looks less blotchy so I like to
apply a little bit on my cheeks again
with this product it's super super
lightweight and pigmented so a little
bit really does go a long way so I like
to apply this a little bit above so my
cheekbone is here I like to apply it a
little bit above that way when I'm
blending it out I don't drop it down too
far I like to make the bottom part of my
face look bigger because I had a little
bit of a weak chin so I don't want to
bring my contour too far down or it's
gonna make this part look even smaller
so I apply a little bit around my
forehead I have a nice big forehead so I
like to apply it all around and then
I'll apply the light just like right
here that way I'm not making it look
bigger if you guys have a smaller
forehead you can either skip this step
or just maybe apply like right along
your hairline and then you don't need
much more than that
I also like to contour right below my
jaw line again to help extend it a
little bit more if you have a larger jaw
or a larger chin and you want to make it
look smaller just bring this line up and
then you're gonna help mock where your
real natural shadows are don't do it
right underneath and then I kind of just
like super on my chin to emphasize it a
little bit and then couple lines to get
rid of my beautiful double chin so as
you guys know I have not had lip
injections in over two years and I had
all of the Juvederm actually removed so
I saw a couple people asking about if I
had gotten them done again and a recent
picture the answer is no I'll show you
guys how I make them look bigger you
guys can see they're pretty small right
now so what I do is I apply the shadow
underneath right here and that's gonna
help make the bottom lip look bigger and
then I like to apply it here here and
here and that's gonna help make this
like lift a little bit for concealer I'm
gonna be using these shape tape in the
color medium this is one of my favorite
concealers I really like it because it's
like a creamy consistency it's not too
drying so normally if I'm doing my
makeup off camera alcohol I just blend
the contour in and then go in with the
concealer but since I'm trying to show
you guys how I like to place everything
I'm gonna just do it all and show you so
I like to apply that under my eye and
like a downwards triangle on my smile
lines my chin and then in between my
brows I don't like to do it down the
center of my nose because I just find it
kind of unnecessary and then it will
it'll move the lines a little bit so I'm
gonna blend my concealer in first with
my Beauty Blender
and then with my morphe m4 3:6 like a
hair I'm gonna blend out the contour and
I use a very very very light hand so you
just want to do very light soft strokes
blend it in towards your hairline first
and then you can kind of blend it into
the concealer as well and another reason
why I love this cream contour product is
because like I said it's super
lightweight so it's not gonna leave you
looking blotchy or anything like that so
again you can see it's a little this is
my natural cheekbone line so again with
a very light hand I'm going to blend it
up and then right up against that line I
have some beautiful dark spots that like
just started appearing like I don't know
a year ago again with a very light hand
we're just gonna slowly kind of blend
that into the concealer that way there
is no harsh lines and it kind of blends
seamlessly
and then we're going to do the same
thing with the Joel
I'm gonna I'm just gonna kind of go over
everything with my beauty blender to
make sure everything's blended nicely
and I'm gonna apply some shape tape
right next to the brown lines link right
up against it and with my Tarte
double-ended brush I'm gonna use this
end and I'm gonna slowly drag the
concealer down and then I'm gonna like
again very lightly Pat it onto my nose
so the key with contouring is like you
don't want to completely cover the brown
otherwise it defeats the whole purpose
so I usually just kind of do this in
steps I like try and blend it first and
then I if I have to reapply like the
brown in any areas I will but as you can
see like don't be afraid to go with the
darker shade because we ends up covering
it
very lightly blend over my beauty
blender so now with my Kat Von D
translucent powder I'm gonna set my
under eyes I'm using my Kat Von D shade
+ light brush this taper to end my make
sure you blend out any of the wrinkles
underneath your eyes and then apply this
powder right under and also right
against the brown on your nose as well I
know it's like crazy to some people to
be like how do you use that much powder
I swear I was one of those people that
I'm like I don't know how people will
use that much powder it's gonna make my
skin so dry and if you use a nice
concealer like the one that I use it's
very nourishing so like it doesn't dry
out your skin and it really does work so
I'm gonna again blend out the wrinkles
and apply I like to apply a little bit
under here on my chin and also my
forehead so as you can see like that
whole luminous foundation is now
basically gone at this point it's all
like that because of the powder anyway
so so next I will always do my brows but
since this is a video focus mainly on my
contour highlight Rutina I'm gonna skip
this part but for brows I use the UH
Nastasia granite brow Wiz and also the
granite brow powder so I was using the
ebony and I switched over to the granite
because I felt like my eyebrows always
looked a little bit lighter than I
wanted so I really really love these
products and I use the anasazi on number
12 eyebrow brush so I'll be right back
okay so now that my eyebrows are drawn
on I'm gonna go in with my shade and
light palette I'm gonna grab these two
shades just a little bit and I'm gonna
go over the cream contour on my nose I
always like to do
before I wipe away the powder because if
it's a little bit too dark the powder is
going to diffuse it
and with the other end of my sheet and
light palette i'm gonna go in with the
middle shade and just very lightly go
over the contour as well
by the way I always got to show you guys
so I'm going to wipe away the powder and
circular motions and I'm going to blend
it over the nose to diffuse it as I had
mentioned again I'm very very light hand
we don't want to move the product we
just want to wipe away the powder
so now that all the powder is wiped away
you are gonna want to use some sort of
setting spray the one that I've been
really loving lately is the clean of
hungary mess it's a little bit pricey
but I ran out of my other one and I
really like how it evenly distributes
all over my face so I'm gonna spray it
now feels so refreshing especially like
after having all that powder it just
kind of brings everything together melts
it all together and I'm gonna use the
little butt of my beauty blender and
just very lightly like push everything
in so since this the video again is all
about the face I'm gonna just do a very
very natural quick my makeup look this
is something I usually do like on a
day-to-day basis I'm gonna just grab a
little bit of this orange shade with my
Sigma e-40 and I'm just gonna apply that
into my crease I'm also gonna grab the a
little bit of the brown shade and apply
that as well and I always like to
connect my eye shadow to the nose
contour that way it all kind of flows
better and obviously I have some eyelash
extensions on I tried them out I kind of
her like ooh ah why I just drop my
palette and it broke everywhere these
past couple days are just not they're
just not good they're not good I just
cleaned my floors so I'm gonna grab this
shade right here which is one of my
favorites I'm gonna highlight under my
brow and to highlight my nose I do this
every single time this is my favorite
color to use for my nose contour so I
like to do an exclamation point on my
nose I apply the dot hock so like the
tip of my nose is here I apply the dot a
little bit higher that way it gives my
nose a nice lifted look so that's
definitely a technique if you guys want
to make your nose look lifted up
highlight a little bit higher all right
here and then I'm gonna apply a line
down the center and I like to keep it
pretty thin again because we're trying
to make my nose look more narrow if you
want your nose a little bit wider you
can make this line a little bit thicker
so before I continue I'm gonna go in
with my Kat Von D medium 57 locket
powder foundation and I'm gonna be
applying that on the sides of my nose
so I take a lot on my brush and I'm
applying that right up against where the
brown is and it's just gonna add more
depth and dimension so this part isn't
necessary if you guys aren't really
going crazy contouring your nose but
when you are using like dark shades it's
good to have like the dark against the
light because it's gonna change the
shadows of your face so you can see it
erases the shadows on the sides of your
nose which in turn make your nose look
smaller I'm also applying this right
here I get pretty oily here so it's just
adding a little bit extra powder and
also on my chin and around my mouth so
grabbing my deep 74 powder foundation
I'm gonna grab a little bit on my brush
and I'm gonna go over again you can use
a bronzer but I just tend to use this
more than a regular bronzer because I
feel like it looks smoother and it
blends in nicely with the lighter
foundation that we already applied under
our eyes and again with this product I
could have probably gotten a shade or
two lighter so a little bit was gonna go
a long way then what I've been doing
we're gonna go back to my palette I'm
gonna take these two darker shades and
since I
I like to highlight highlight my cheeks
I've just been using this over my
bronzer to give it like a subtle glow so
just a little bit that way I'm not like
super super matte and I also take that
same gold highlight I apply it right on
my Cupid's bow and also here I know a
lot of you guys don't like that but
since I did contour here here and here
it's good to highlight as well because
it's really gonna help bring that part
out and make your lips appear larger I'm
gonna apply a little bit right in here
as well did I finish talking about my
eyelash extensions I don't remember
I got eyelash extensions probably like a
month ago and I'm obsessed with them I'm
going to the Bahamas for my mom's
birthday and I just really loved them
when I had them last year so if you guys
are in New Jersey I will list my girl's
name and info below she's amazing and I
highly highly recommend her so I'm gonna
use my feline flick liner and just line
my upper lash line just a little bit I'm
gonna also grab a little bit of that
orange and brown shade and I'm just
going to do a little on my lower lash
line we're gonna go back in with the
same spray and then I'm not gonna use
any mascara I'm just gonna use like a
little wanna just like brush my lashes
for lips I'm using the pickup liner by
the balm cosmetics in the color a cute
one and I'm gonna show you guys how I
make my lips look larger so I always
obviously over line them so what I like
to do is or align them and shape them
and then blend them in
so you can see before and after
and now instant lip injections so now
the final step is blush I'm using my BH
nude blush palette
so this is the final result I hope you
