in today's video we're going to be
talking all about boobies so I'm going
to give a little disclaimer now if you
are uncomfortable with seeing booths
amount of splash you guys don't worry
but if you're uncomfortable with
cleavage you're comfortable with the
conversations of boobs you don't want to
see bras you want to be my cleavage
personally and then please click out of
this video now this video right here is
for all my drugs out there who I have
been requesting it and be well maybe
smaller boobs but want to make them look
a little bit bigger so I've seen so many
people asking lately as I've gotten a
boob job
which no I have not not against them I
think if you want a boob job and that's
something that you personally want I
think that's awesome so today I'm just
going to show you what I personally do
how I personally make them look a little
bit bigger and what bras I use and I'm
going to show you like two different
shirts you do an idea of what I do make
sure to stay tuned to the end of the
video because I will be announcing a
huge giveaway so without further ado you
want to hear a little bit more than
please keep watching something to keep
in mind before I get started is we all
have different moves and boobs are
beautiful any shape and size it doesn't
matter they're beautiful they're natural
they're here to feed our children that
is the main purpose of them so I'm going
to just take you through like the bras
that I use on the little cutlets that I
use all that good stuff that way you
guys can try out for yourself and
hopefully it'll work for you like it
works for me so right now I'm wearing a
bombshell bra from Victoria's Secret
this is the strapless bra the one that
adds the two cup sizes my bra size is a
32 C so that's what size I actually am
in like a regular on the padded bra but
for strapless bras I like to go a size
down because this tighter and it helps
push my boobs up even more so again I'm
normally a 32 C button shuffles product
i buy 32 B so since I'm going down a
size and it adds two cup sizes this
technically only adding one cup size so
I always like to add a little bit extra
I think
this for a really long time now but ever
since I was begin and I'm not even just
saying because of that but I feel like
as I've been eating a lot more my boobs
maybe grow a little bit more I've gained
about like six pounds in the past year
not trying I just really haven't been
watching what I've been eating I just
begin and I eat whatever I want whenever
I want so I don't lot of people were
like oh well he'll expect when the old
videos do boobs look super small and
they were a little bit smaller back then
but a guy didn't wear the bombshell bras
and B I was really skinny for a while I
was probably about like 20 pounds it's
probably when the in Bret first started
dating I was working out like insane
every single day and I lost a lot of
weight and I wasn't eating healthy so
when I was doing all that I lost a lot
of my curves and the past year since we
did go vegan I'm eating so much more
and yeah I gained a little bit of weight
but I'm okay with it I'm happy I have
this brought in a 32 C but the strap is
too big on me and it falls down easily I
like this one because it's tight so it
doesn't move so if I'm wearing strapless
stuff it's going to stay there all night
so what I put in my strapless bras are
these little cutlets so this is what it
look like they're silicone and really
twitchy so well here let's get the hair
of the way so this one has a cutlet and
then this one doesn't have the cutlet so
you can see it just adds more volume to
your boobs
normally I guess they're supposed to go
right side off the thicker part here but
I flip it upside down because the bra
already has a panning on the bottom so
when you flip it upside down it's
putting that push up right on the top so
we have the push up on the bottom and
now we have that extra push up on the
top so it's giving your doing some extra
lift as well as fullness so it's good
back in so I'll always like scoop it and
like put that under so you could see
let's take them out
so this is what they look like without
the silicone padding but again the bra
is padded to begin with it's the add two
cup sizes so these are the ones that I
always wear so whenever I wear a shirt
like this and I'm going out somewhere
and I want my boobs to look nice I'll
wear those I don't want them all the
time and I don't wear them with my
regular bras I only wear them with my
strapless bras so for my regular bras I
wear the same bombshell bra and I get it
in my size so it's online it will add
two cup sizes to your suit so that is my
view again upside down I like to scoop
my boobs and then it like sits right on
top of the bra you can see the
difference
scoop and voila big boobs and they
jiggle more and everything again with my
regular bra in my normal size I don't
wear these there was one night and I'll
never do it again that I wore the
cutlets in my regular bra and I was only
because my slit was really high in my
dress so I wanted my boob pill with a
little higher that way maybe I should
show a little bit of cleavage and we
were out and I got sweaty and I was
leaning over talking to somebody and
thank God my hands was like free and I'm
holding a drink or anything
but it slips right out into my hand so I
was like oh my god like put it back in
and when I never again so I don't
recommend wearing them with these types
of bras because the padding comes up the
side and then they'll slip right out
especially if you get a little sweaty
when this broad was a strapless bra and
flipping it upside down I've never had
any issues they've never fallen out and
I've done this for well over a year now
that is my major bra it is literally
life-changing so what I also like to do
which I to do I'll do right now I like
to highlight my boobs because it brings
them forward a little bit so I'm going
to use my pallet I'm going to just take
a little bit of this color I'm just
going to highlight them
and then I also like to highlight here
and then a little on my shoulders if you
want to get a step further you can
contour it to give it a little bit more
depth which I'm not going to do with
this shirt but I'll show you a different
shirt that I would do something like
that in so that is what I do for
strapless bras again because the size is
down it's a little bit tighter so it
doesn't fall down as easily so try to
check out what we know how it works for
you guys now I'm going to switch to the
shirts that I recently just posted in my
fashion wall which I told you you guys
can use like bathing suit pad and wet so
before I put that shirt on these are the
bathing suit pending that I usually use
I'll link them for you guys as you can
see they're not like just your regular
thin one they have a little bit of that
padding underneath so whenever I have to
wear a shirt wear my back is showing and
I can't wear a bra I'll use these but to
be honest I usually try and make my
strapless bra work because if I want
some cleavage I need to have a bra I'm
going to just a shirt on and I'll see
you guys in a second okay so this is the
top and I put a pair of these little
guys in it these are like a size C and
then I also bought upside Z for like the
smaller top so this is the same thing
that I used in my bathing suit as well
so it gives me a little bit of like a
push up and then if I were going to the
beach or something like that obviously I
wouldn't do this but if I'm wearing a
shirt like this out to dinner and I have
my makeup done and I want to make them
look a little bit better
I conjure them a little bit so I did
this in my last video so I'll show you
guys again but I'm just going to use
like a little brush like this and my
contour kit from Kat Von D and I'm just
going to shade in the parts that are
already shaded
you
so you can see how it just adds a little
bit more shading which helps make it
look a little bit bigger
you
hi I'm conferring the to you wouldn't
want to block such beautiful things what
is your response anything I want to job
I'm leaving you why the would you ruin
something so perfect wait them look big
and he likes a little a lot of things on
their brain just show so that as well do
four shirts like this
these babies new padding's are literally
life I never wear bathing suits without
the padding and there's been times where
like I have and I was actually at a
family party and so much you must mean
they're like when did your boobs get so
small and I'm like you've always been
small I do not make them look big like
so again with without so as far as tips
and tricks that's literally all that I
do I only wear two bras over the
bombshell bra in a strapless version and
the larger version so anything that's
appluse I can't wear a bra with I always
wear bathing suit padding and if I can't
wear either of those I'm just not going
to be wearing the shirt so unfortunately
I only have my boobs that I can work
with so I know this is what works for me
I'm sure there's other people on YouTube
who have done a similar video for maybe
girls with large boobs that want to help
keep them off and all that but this is
just my personal tips and tricks for me
just really about working with what
you've got
and feeling comfortable and what you're
wearing so I just wanted to share some
these tricks because hey they work for
me and see it's a way to take a boob job
without having to pay all that money so
these little cutlets are literally like
where they up there in the drop
obviously there's literally so cheap I
have like three pairs because sometimes
I miss placement also again eating
healthy and feeding your body what it
means is super important like I said a
few years back I was super super skinny
though obviously when you gain weight
lose weight that's going to affect it as
well so back then I could use this trick
but I didn't really start wearing the
cutlets until about a year after my
skinniest point so yeah that is really
it for now if you guys have any other
questions comments concerns I'll be
happy to answer them all below so make
sure to comment below I think I pretty
much covered everything
again I was going to try on another or
shirt but I mean I was going to try this
one on for you guys I wore this in my
last video in a white color but I just
wore the same thing I just was shuffles
Robin cutlets so there's really nothing
different about it also again doing the
contour and highlighting can help and
the mention just like on your face
becomes where our cheekbones to make
them pop same thing down here so I hope
this video helps you guys I hope you
enjoy hopefully live something new I
hope I didn't offend anyone but listen
girls we all have them so let's embrace
them let's love ourselves love our
bodies and yes so next let's talk about
the giveaway I had a bunch of different
ideas in mine but I think I have found
one perfect idea for this next giveaway
so as you guys know in the past I've
done the cheats for changing it away
I've done two small acts of kindness
giveaways and I was going to maybe think
about doing one of those again which I
probably will before summer's over
but for this giveaway I wanted to do
something a little bit different so I've
just finished reading one of my favorite
books for the second time and it helps
give me the idea for this next giveaway
so in order to enter this giveaway what
do I have to do is you have to film
yourself facing one of your biggest
fears so for instance one of my biggest
fears is speaking in front of people
like being on stage a crowd of people
that is like one of my biggest fears
ever I know it's crazy because I do
YouTube but it's funny because a lot of
youtubers that I've met are the same as
me where we're totally fine sitting in
our room alone filming on camera but
when it comes to speaking on stage in
front of so many people it's just super
frightening so I actually faced one of
my fears when I was in Malaysia and I
presented an award and it felt so good
and walking off that stage after I did
it after all that build-up and then
sensation of just like not wanting to do
it and just thinking of every spot one
how I can get out of it but I'm so happy
I went through with it
and our fears hold us back from so much
in life even if you don't even realize
it so one thing I want you guys to do is
just to face one of your biggest fears
so what you have to do in the video is
sit down talk to me let me know why it's
one of your fears maybe the story behind
it there's always a reason that you have
that fear and that
so myself facing that year so that's
what you guys have to do to enter I will
list all the details below as well you
have two choices you can upload it
either on Instagram or on YouTube I'll
be taking three people from YouTube and

card and you're also going to win $500
worth of amazing makeup someone put a
nice big goodie box together for you

prize this time around so the grand
prize winner will also win $500 worth of
