just woke up it's around 9 a.m. and I
was gonna film something else today but
yesterday I unfortunately woke up with a
sty it was my first time ever getting a
sty so I was kind of freaking out I
didn't know what was going on but I knew
exactly where I came from thank the Lord
because otherwise I would have been
freaking out trying to throw away all my
makeup two days ago when I filmed my
makeup tutorial for you guys I usually
do one eye and then I'll film myself
doing the other eye when I did the first
day I was using a pair of lashes that
were brand new that I hadn't used before
so they were a little too long and they
were like poking at the side of my eye
here so what I did was I used my little
eyebrow scissor and I tried to snip like
the little corner off that way they
wouldn't be so uncomfortable and I guess
that metal part touched inner part of my
eye and there was some bacteria or
something on it so yesterday I had
planned on filming a new video for you
guys but when I woke up with this eye I
was like alright I googled it and I said
the number one thing you shouldn't do is
put makeup on so I kind of wanted to
just stay barefaced not film anything I
went through my entire Beauty room
sanitized everything I started packing
some stuff I used like those Clorox
bleach wipes and I literally like
cleaned everything so now I feel nice
and clean and fresh and today actually
is almost gone I didn't want to do
makeup again today so I figured what
better time than now to teach you guys
how to shave your face so in my previous
favourites video I mentioned that I
started to shave my face ever since
Nicole Guerrero told me about it I had
heard about it in the past but I was
just convinced that your hair would go
back like black and the last thing that
I wanted was a nice dark beard
so I will let you guys know because I
have been doing it for a few months I do
notice like the peach fuzz on my face
looks a little bit more than what I had
prior to doing this so if you guys have
barely any hair on your face and it's
like tiny tiny peach fuzz I would
definitely recommend skipping this
altogether the only reason I wanted to
try it was because I heard
makes your makeup go on so much smoother
and it's actually really true it does
make your makeup look a lot more
flawless so if you guys again have small
small small peach fuzz and it's blonde
and it doesn't bother you do not follow
this stuff this is just for the girls
out there that maybe have a little bit
more facial hair or you want your makeup
to go on smoother so that was just a
little disclaimer for those of you guys
obviously it's not growing back thick or
anything like that I'd stop doing it if
that were the case but I did notice in a
picture that I took you could kind of
see like the little fuzzies so you're
only gonna need one little tool for this
video I have these little so weird I
just like looked and it looks like it's
dark out right now it's 9 a.m. what's
going on anyways so what you're going to
need is a little mini razor like this I
believe these ones are the eyebrow
razors I will definitely like them they
come in like a three pack so you can use
them more than one so I'll show you what
I do at the end to make sure that it's
nice and clean but all you're going to
need is this little razor and I'm going
to just show you guys how to quickly
shave your face and it's so easy it's so
quick I do this probably once maybe
twice a month if that what I also
recommend doing is doing this at night
when you're not planning on applying
makeup after that the reason for that is
when you are removing the fuzzies off of
your face it's actually an anti-aging
treatment as well it's removing the top
layer of skin off of your face so it's
going to leave your skin feeling like a
baby's bottom it's going to remove any
dead skin it's just a really great
overall exfoliating treatment so the
reason I recommend doing this at night
is once you've washed your entire face
all your makeups off you want to have no
lotion on your face you want to do that
and then you want to apply your serums
your lotions and your skin is going to
really really really absorb all of the
treatment lotions that you're putting on
because your pores are going to be nice
and fresh and nice and open so I am
waking up and doing this just because I
wanted to get a video up before the day
is over we have plans a little bit later
so yeah let's get started so I always
like to start on the bottom part of my
face what you're always gonna want to do
is take your finger and pull your skin
up so you don't want to hold it flat
against your face you don't want to hold
it straight out like this you want it to
just be at a tiny bit of an angle so
and you're going to want to do downwards
motions so pulling up my face I'm just
going to go and just do little swipes
and so funny because I could see the
little hairs flying so basically just
want to do like downward swiping you
don't want to just do one swipe you just
want to do like slow steady swipes like
that so
I'm like kind of far from my mirror but
can you see probably not I honestly
can't believe that it looks like it's
midnight outside what is going on and
you're just going to repeat the same
step
all around and if you want to do your
sideburns I used to cut my sideburns
which was biggest mistake in my life so
I let them grow obviously so they could
fit behind my ear but sometimes you'll
get like little stragglers
I feel so soft ready
so my fuzzies so many fuzzies
okay so I only do like this part I don't
really do like under my eyes or anything
like that and you could do your forehead
same thing just make sure you're pulling
the skin up be very careful the first
time that I did this um I was in a light
with Nicole and she was showing me what
to do well first I did was I went and I
pushed way too hard and I had a big cut
so the key is a very very light hand you
just want to very lightly graze the top
of your skin you don't want to push it
down and then do it because you're gonna
cut yourself so again it's just do it
with a very very light hand and be
careful where you're doing it because
another thing when I did the first time
was I shaved part of my eyebrow off
which we don't want to happen so just be
careful I don't really have a lot of
hair on my forehead so I just do a
little bit and if you actually look into
this treatment there are a lot of salons
that will actually do it along with a
facial because there are so many
beneficial reasons to do it so that is
another reason I do it I mean before I
did it I didn't realize what I was
missing to be honest it's not like
something I think everybody should go
out and do but if you have that extra
hair and you want to get rid of it
I think this is a really cool way to do
it so I think that's really good you
never want to do it up always just down
that's another tip I feel like today's
one of those days where you just want to
knock it out of bed it's like so gloomy
here in Jersey I understand um yeah so I
guess that's really basically it what I
always do after because you can reuse
these I have this little spray that I
picked up from Harmons it was like a
little empty one and I put 91% rubbing
alcohol in here that way it just
sterilizes and cleans it so what I will
do after I'm done is I will just spray
it and then wipe it off on the towel
and then put the little cap back on it
and then I have a little drawer where I
keep them and again they come in a
3-pack so you can reuse them that's
probably like the third time that I'm
using that one
they're basically like disposable razors
so once you're all finished you can
apply your serums your night cream all
that stuff for me since it is daytime
and I'm gonna be having to leave the
house soon I'm going to just put some
face day cream on this is the vital see
hydrating Repair Cream it's literally
empty I just got into one of them it's
my image skincare and it smells the corn
jizz so I'm just gonna apply this over
my face so that is it that's how I do it
it's super easy nothing crazy
my skin feels so soft after um again try
it your own risk if you are under the
age of 18 or ask your mother or your
father because I don't want to tell you
guys to go do this and then it ends up
backfiring so definitely look into it a
little bit more if you guys want if you
do have naturally really dark hair on
your face I'm not sure if this would be
a good idea I don't know if it will make
it grow back thicker I don't know if
that's a myth I don't really know what
but I've noticed that it's made my skin
look a lot better and I always just had
that like blonde peach fuzz on my face
so definitely do your homework look into
it a little bit more these razors are
super affordable I will link everything
for you guys and I hope you enjoyed that
video I'm gonna drink the rest of my
iced coffee to get my day going and at
least I got a nice fresh face now so I
love you guys so much thank you for
watching and until next time I will see
you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
