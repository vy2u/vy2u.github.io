today's video I'm going to show you how
I personally blow-dry my hair my hair is
super long and it's frizzy it's a little
bit curly so it's kind of hard to
maintain so I figured since it's been
like I don't know four or five years
since I posted my last one I would
update you guys and just show you
exactly what I do has maybe you guys can
learn a thing or two and it'll make your
blow-dry routine a little bit shorter so
if you guys want to see how I below dry
my hair then please keep watching since
you want to meet my videos in which why
don't you see hi everybody thank you for
watching do you miss mommy mommy missed
you so it is currently 8 o'clock at
night I turned out all my lights in the
house hopefully it's not too dark for
you my hair is still damp as you can see
I showered probably like two hours ago
so that's one tip that I definitely
recommend for you guys if you want your
hair to grow and you want it to stay as
healthy as possible obviously it's
impossible to not use any heat on it
whatsoever so if you can let it air dry
you're gonna use a lot less heat in the
long run so a couple months back I
picked up this Dyson a supersonic hair
dryer and I honestly forgot about it it
was sitting next to my couch and I was
like you know what I'm gonna try this
one out today this one came with some
way hair products the other hair and
drying that I use is still packs because
I just got back from a little trip so
I'll let you know what I think of this
hair dryer it's kind of like a review
plus tutorial all-in-one so I'm gonna
open up this guy I've heard a lot of
good things about it and I have the
Dyson what's it called
oh whoa definitely peed somewhere in my
room when I was away by the way every
time I walk by my room I smell it and I
don't know where it is yeah
Pisa everywhere so it comes with a
storage bag nice decent size and has
like a magnet so this specific set came
with four way
right products shampoo repair
conditioner soft mousse and hair oil I
think that's why I ended up picking up
because I was like yes so this is what
comes in the box a diffuser which I
never really use diffusers the dryer
it's really lightweight which I'm
excited about because everyone knows
blow-drying your hair is a workout and
it comes with two nozzles one is thicker
and one a thinner take all the plastic
off of this I have all my cats here
right now I'm gonna use the wider nozzle
oh just like a magnet nice and just goes
right on this is exciting I haven't used
the nouveau jar in a while so I hope
it's as good as its advertised cats are
definitely afraid of it so they're gonna
go wrong can we take a second for my
shirt who watches changer things I saw
this as like an Instagram and when I was
in the Bahamas my mom was gambling and I
was like online shopping because I
really just don't like gambling so let
me talk about my hair for a minute
normally what I like to do if I know I
don't need to do my hair right away is I
will shower braid it and then in the
morning it's gonna have like nice beachy
waves in it I've done a bunch of Cardon
treatments like I've told you guys but
the past probably like two and a half
maybe three years I've only done like
the front part of my hair so like all of
this back here is my natural hair so
it's like a little bit curly and like
frizzy if I let it air dry it would
honestly be like out to here so I think
you can kind of see how it's getting
crazy so what I always like to do is I
like to section off of my hair and this
definitely helps speed up the whole blow
drying process especially if you up
stick hair because it may seem dry at
some point and then there's like pieces
underneath that aren't and then as soon
as you walk out the house it's gonna get
frizzy so if you do it in layers it
might take maybe like an extra five
minutes but you know each layer is gonna
be super dry so I feel like that's like
really important so I always just split
it down the center and bring it all to
the front so I have two brushes that I
always use to do my hair I have they're
both by dry bar there
round brushes like this you can get any
brand I had a different brand that
worked really really good but I just
needed new ones so I came across these
and I picked them up you guys can see my
hair is like pretty frizzy naturally my
cats are in the box
hey get out barrels
what are you doing in mommy's box get
out the smaller one is the smoothing
nozzle gentle low velocity airflow to
dry and style at the same time and then
the other one is styling concentrate are
fast precise airflow for controlled
styling one section at a time and then
diffuser so they're all magnetic I'm I
don't know there's like a lot of things
going on with this so I just hope I have
to turn it on and I got scared too with
a theory okay so when I turn it on it
automatically gets hot so I'm gonna go
with it and what I always like to do is
always keep my hair in the front it's
just easier and then I will just take it
under and just start smoothing it this
way I'm blow-drying it
push the phone button let it cool down a
little bit and then I just kind of like
twist it off so you can see how the
bottoms are like curled under a little
bit I always like to just curl it a
little bit but you could see the
difference
so you only want to press the cold
button once you know your hair is
completely dry because then it'll stay
nice and shiny and not frizzy at all so
now that that section is done I'm gonna
go and bring another section and I'm
going to bring it all to the front
now that I know that it's basically all
dry I'm gonna go in with the little
smaller one and then I'm gonna curl the
bottoms under because it'll last a
little bit longer especially for my hair
and when I do the front of my hair I
know a lot of people like will go like
this and blow upwards I always take it
from the top and like scoop it like that
that way it stays flat down I don't know
it's just what always works best for me
I think Cindy's really interested in
what I'm doing right now and as you can
see it all kind of curled under I'm just
gonna take it all one more time and wrap
it around
take the smaller brush
nice and silky so so far I really like
this hairdryer I think you can really
make any dryer work the brushes I think
are a little bit more key but so far my
hair Lu's looking super shiny and silky
so I like it so now I'm gonna go to my
last section of hair and I always like
to part it in the center
I take all this hair bring it into the
back so what I like to do first is I
like to start with the back piece I'm
just gonna clip this like together and
I'm gonna do all this together and then
all of this together so I'm gonna use
the larger round brush I like to always
like scoop everything up and over so I'm
grabbing from underneath but I'm
blow-drying it up and over if that makes
sense
try baby
so once that's like basically all dry
I'll bring in the front and say hey I
like to do it away from my face
I'm sweating
so next I'm gonna move on to this side
and then I'm gonna do like this whole
front piece together to give it like a
nice like curled under look I'm gonna
start with the back section make sure
it's all brushed out
so now I'm going to take this front
section of my hair and I'm gonna do the
same thing with the smaller size brush
so if you guys have a lot of time once
you release it you can roll it up in the
roller and then pin it and let it cool
on its own that's just a little trick
and then it will definitely give you
guys more body around the top of your
hair but I think the blow-dryer works
really really well I think my hair looks
nice and healthy I'll show you guys the
back
so I hope you guys learn something new
in today's video I hope you enjoyed I
definitely give the Dyson two thumbs up
I think it worked really really well
there are a lot of good hair dryers that
are I'm sure half the price or even a
third of the price so don't feel like
you need to go out and buy this one so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and until next
time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
