have honey
if you could stay like that thank you
for watching we should get to the rest
my social gaps are you special guest so
today I'm here with Brooke thank you for
taking over my entrance a great job girl
and how old are you 10 years old and how
long have you been trying to fill this
video girl it's really been that long so
we finally got it done how do you like
your hair it's good
today's video we're going to teach you
how to get this hairstyle right here
quick turn up gorgeous we filmed the
whole video it wasn't recording so we
redid it for you guys if you guys give
this hair just keep watching keep
watching so the first thing that you're
going to want to do for this hairstyle
is spray the front with water so it's a
little bit easier and it's gonna be a
little bit more smooth then you just
want to brush out the hair and make sure
it's fully brushed it's gonna be a lot
easier to braid when there's no knots in
the hair so I'm gonna start this braid
right on the side by her ear and I'm
gonna be doing a Dutch braid so if you
guys want a more in-depth tutorial as
well I tried showing good angles on this
one I do have another video which I will
link below for you guys to do a Dutch
braid you're going to start out with
three sections of hair and each side is
going to go under the middle each time
you're going to grab a piece of hair so
the first piece I'm putting underneath
the middle second piece putting under
the middle and then I'm going to start
grabbing hair so you want to grab hair
from the front section you want to leave
the back part back and smooth you're
going to see I'm only grabbing hair from
the front piece for this I'm going to
leave all the back smooth back so as I
grab each section I'm going to make sure
it's smooth I'm going to cross it under
the middle I'm going to tighten it and
then I'm going to keep repeating so I'm
going to grab the section of hair put it
under the middle tighten it and you want
to make sure there's Breda staying close
to the front of there
so with any braided hairstyle the key to
making it look nice and neat is to
tighten it in between each section I
didn't part the front of the hair
because I don't want it to be a smooth
line you'll see once I'm done there
won't be really any lines it'll just
kind of all flow really nicely so you
just again want to repeat the same
things over and over I'm going to leave
it in normal speed so that way anyone
may be having a little bit of trouble
can follow along and see exactly what
I'm doing
if you guys want this whole look to be a
lot more smooth and slick you can use
like a pomade or you can use hairspray
as you're going I personally like when
it looks a little bit more messy so I'm
not going to use any of that for her
hair
you're going to continue this braid all
the way down and wrap it around by her
ear and then once I get to the bottom
piece I'm going to turn her around so
you can see it from behind but it's
really just the same exact thing all
around the head
the
when you run out of hair by her ear
you're going to start grabbing from the
top section and these pieces you want to
make sure our smooth down so that way it
looks really nice so as I am grabbing
I'm going to be grabbing from the right
side a little piece underneath and then
on the left side I'm grabbing those
bigger pieces that come straight down if
that makes any sense it's kind of hard
to explain
but I'm hoping with these two angles you
guys can really see what I'm talking
about
so once you're almost done wrapping it
around your hair and you're picking up
the last piece you're just going to keep
it super super tight and you're just
going to braid it down into a regular
braid and then you just want to fasten
it with a little elastic I'm using just
like a little clear one you can get
right at the drugstore they also come in
different colors depending on the hair
color and if there are any short pieces
that come out like some that you see
right here don't worry we're going to
use a lot of bobby pins and we're going
to secure everything so it looks neater
once you've secured the bottom you just
want to slowly separate the breed a
little bit just to make it a little bit
thicker we're gonna then wrap that
around and cover where we originally
started that braid so it looks a lot
nicer
so once you wrap it around you want to
bobby pin it in place you just want to
tuck the end of it underneath one of the
braids on top the key to making this
look perfect is to just kind of keep
working the braid Bobby pinning it and
just kind of fluffing it in certain
areas just so it looks like it's one
full wraparound braid also it is a
little bit hard with some of the
flyaways but again just keep using
hairspray and keep pinning it down until
you get the desired result this was only
my second time doing this hairstyle so
maybe it could have been a little bit
slicker and neater but I think it came
out really cute and she loved it so
that's all that matters now your New
York so you can see if you like it do
you love it
oh so cute
got stuck on shanz alia this is the
final result well thank you so much for
