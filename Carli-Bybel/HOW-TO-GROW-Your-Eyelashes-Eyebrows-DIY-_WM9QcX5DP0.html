today's video I'm gonna be showing you
an at-home method to make your eyelashes
and your eyebrows grow so I originally
saw how to do this from one of my
giveaway winners so thank you to
Kristina for showing me this awesome
technique because I've been using it the
past few months and I'm loving it
I have tried out the Latisse before but
when I found out that it can turn your
blue eyes brown I stopped using it so I
really wasn't using anything for a while
but when I came across this method I was
so pleasantly surprised as to how
amazing it actually works and this
method is definitely a lot more
affordable than some of the other serums
I've seen out there so if you guys want
to learn how to do it please keep
watching so to create your own serum to
make your eyelashes and eyebrows grow
you're gonna need three different types
of oils and I wasn't able to find these
in any drugstore near me so I just got
them right off of Amazon I will link
everything below but the first thing
you're gonna need is castor oil and this
is a hundred percent pure versatile
skincare castor oil so it is safe for
your skin the second thing you're gonna
need is coconut oil and this one is pure
extra virgin organic coconut oil and you
can use this to cook you can use it for
your skin you can use it for so many
different things and it's so amazing and
I actually found out about this from
Raths mom because she had purchased it
for us a few months back and I've been
using it when I get out of the shower
just all over my body and it's just
smells so amazing so this does have
multiple purposes so I definitely
recommend trying this out and the third
oil you're going to need is avocados and
it's a hundred percent pure moisturizing
oil and again these you can get on
Amazon so they're super easy to find
what you're also going to need is a
container to hold all of this in I got
these little travel-size bottles they're
a pack of four and they're from
Walgreens they were just right on the
Shelf and they were very very
inexpensive the reason I got the four
pack is because it was a great deal and
you can use these when you're traveling
for shampoo for lotion anything like
that
so whatever concealer is like don't use
Sharyl ends up using for something else
so I'm just gonna take one of these
containers of course I got to pick the
pink one so what we're gonna do is mix
half coconut oil and half castor oil in
this jar and you're gonna apply a little
bit of avocado oil as well you don't
need the avocado oil but I read online
that it's actually really really good
for you so I wanted to add a little bit
of that as well so you're just gonna
unscrew the cap and try and make it half
castor and then half coconut hmm first
you got to take off the little safety
thing
you
be careful if you have a big jar like
this because
it's not basically going everywhere but
it's okay because I'll just whip the
excess amaze again and then the third
step you're just gonna add a little bit
of the avocado oil
I'm in shape and now you have your hair
growth serum and you're going to apply
this onto your eyelashes and your
eyebrows as well and what I did is I
just bought this pack of and then what I
also did is place an order of a pack of
how many 50 different deluxe disposable
curved mascara brushes so they came in
this one pack and these are perfect
because you don't really want to use the
same one to apply this because if it
gets bacteria on it the last thing you
want is getting that in your eye so
you're just gonna take one of your wands
and the beauty of these little
travel-size thing is they have a little
hole in them so all you have to do is
just put the wand right in the hall and
then it kind of acts as a mascara would
and it clears some of the oil off of it
and I like to just make it go back in
one more time to make sure there's not
too too much oil and what you're going
to do is you're going to apply it as if
you're applying your mascara
you
then what I like to do is take a little
bit of the excess oil on one of my
fingers and then just rub it along my
lash line
we just applied some mascara just to
show you guys how long my lashes really
are so I hope you guys go out and try
this method and hopefully learn
something new until the next video I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
