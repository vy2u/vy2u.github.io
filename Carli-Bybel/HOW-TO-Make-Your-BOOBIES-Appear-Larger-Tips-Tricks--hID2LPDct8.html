you can see by the title of this video
I'm going to be talking about boobies
today so for some of you this may be a
little bit uncomfortable or some of you
may think it's inappropriate but I think
it has been my number one requested
video for quite some time now but the
way I see it I'm just here to help out
some of my girlfriend's teach them some
tips and tricks on different things that
I've done in the past to make my boobs
appear larger um I've had a lot of
people asking if I had recently gotten a
boob job which is a compliment because
no I have not gotten a boob job I just
wear a really good bras and kind of know
how to work with what I got so I'm just
gonna basically go through a few tips on
different things that I do and different
things that I recommend for those of you
looking to make your boobs look a little
bit larger or just shaped a little bit
nicer so if you guys want to hear a
little bit more about it please keep
watching and this is my disclaimer right
now that if you think I shouldn't be
talking about boobs and you don't want
to see some cleavage turn the video off
now because this one is definitely not
for you so if you guys want to hear a
little bit more about it please keep
watching so my first tip is to make sure
you're wearing the proper bra size you
guys can go into any of the stores and
they'll measure you for free so
definitely make sure you're getting the
right size because that's like one of
the biggest thing if you're not wearing
the right size you can be spilling out
in the wrong areas and it can just give
you a weird shape so that's definitely
the first thing that you need to do
second is buy a push-up bra so there's a
million different types of push-up bras
out there the ones that I've been
wearing forever now and that I have in
basically every single color are the
Victoria's Secret bombshell bras I'm
sure most of you guys have already heard
of them they and two cup sizes so some
people may see this as false
advertisement I like to see it as a nice
push-up bra it really gives them a nice
shape and pushes them up and just gives
you some great cleavage so I basically
bought it in every single color and
those are really the only bras that I
wear right now they also have the same
type of bra in a strapless version which
is
what I'm wearing right now and it also
adds the two cup sizes for any of you
guys looking for some extra lift or just
extra shaping shape it just that a word
I think it's just like a foam padding
that's in these it's not anything
uncomfortable it's a what a bras it's
not gonna burst on you these are a
little bit more pricey so on my blog I'm
going to put some other bras that I've
tried out that are maybe a little bit
similar or that I also recommend so
definitely check out that so for those
of you who are asking what types of bras
I wear it's either this checklist one or
this one so some of you guys may think
okay well that's like false advertising
you're making your boobs look bigger and
I'm gonna guess in a way yeah but if you
have absolutely no boobs and you wear it
maybe it'll be false advertising but if
as long as you got a little something to
work with I don't really think it's that
big of a deal plus my boyfriend already
obviously knows what my boobs look like
so for me I could wear so much padding
as I want and I can get away with it
when I was back in high school I of
course was not wearing these types of
bras I had just regular on pad and maybe
like a little bit of a padding bra and
that was enough for me um once I got a
little bit older and I wanted my boobs
to be a little bit bigger I went out and
I tried this one and I just haven't
bought anything since so if you guys do
want to spend a little extra money it is
definitely worth it in my opinion so for
those of you who want the same type of
push-up but you don't want to go out and
spend the money I got these little
silicone gel boobie things off of Amazon
and their social squishy but you can put
these right into your bra or your
strapless bra and it's going to give you
instant lift so if you're wearing the
add two cup sizes bride effin Utley
don't recommend putting these in there
because your boobs are just gonna look
ridiculously massive but if you have a
bra with less padding or maybe no
padding stick one of these in each side
and it's going to really boost up your
boobs so I'm wearing a padded bra right
now but I'm just going to give you guys
a quick example of how much bigger the
look
look at laughs so that's will stick
these bad boys in this video so yeah
look at that instant cleavage
so again false advertising
maybe but I don't know for my girls out
there who've used them before
are they not amazing it's just instant
cleavage so for those of us that don't
want to get the boob jobs these are
definitely great cheaper options to make
your boobs look nice and full so my next
tip for you guys is to sleep in a tight
cami or something that's gonna just keep
your boobs nice and up nice and up I
wear these shirts you probably see me
wear these a bunch they're from anorexia
I have literally every single color
because I literally wear them every
single day it's like a built-in bustier
so it doesn't have a bra in it or
underwire but it has little like areas
for your boobs to keep them nice and
intact
I sleep with these almost every single
night if not this then something just
tight because I don't know I have a
theory that if you sleep with them nice
and up they'll stay up and in my case
that's what's worked best for me if you
wear something loose are a little bit
more baggy if you're just kind of laying
to the side or lying on your stomach
they can get like smushed or like just I
don't know like tilted the wrong way you
guys understand what I'm saying so wear
something nice and tight to keep them
nice and lifted while you're sleeping
because I think that's one of the
biggest problems that a lot of people
don't realize my next tip is to apply
whatever night cream that you use on
your face onto your boobs before you go
to bed this may seem a little bit weird
as well but I use the Nerium face lotion
so if any of you guys have tried it it's
really really sticky and cystic
consistency um I always like to add a
little extra pump and then just put the
excess but all are my boobs and I don't
know I think that really has helped as
well think about if you're putting
anti-aging stuff on your face and on
your neck why not put it on your boobs
because like our skin starts to Sag our
boobs start to sag so let's try and keep
them nice and perky for as long as
possible so I quickly wanted to put on
one of my shirts that I wore my blog
post cuz I saw a lot of people asking I
think this is where it all kind of
started was with
this shirt is the cage shirt that I wore
in my cage blog post I wear these little
sticky bras I have like a bunch of them
the ones with the sticky like this I
like to unhook them now so they're just
like two little pieces so this is what
I'll wear with this type of shirt
another trick that I'll do when I wear
something like this is I take my brow
bar because it has a nice brown shadow
in it and a blending brush and you just
fill in where your cleavage is and it
helps accentuate it and also makes them
look a lot bigger
you see see how it's so natural and
makes them look bigger because what it
does is it adds more depth kind of like
contouring your face
first I'll do that and then I'll take
any type of highlighter and I just add
it right to the lighter parts
it just really gives some dimension to
them which again makes them look larger
so that is what I'll do for like tops
like this um I mean we all have
different shapes sizes everything so of
course everyone's are going to look a
little bit different so that is
definitely what I like to do when I'm
wearing more low-cut shirts or shirts
where I am NOT wearing a push-up bra so
it gives it a little bit more to mention
a little bit more cleavage and yeah
that's just like something I've done I'm
gonna say really at least five or six
years now when I figured I wanted to try
make them look bigger I just kind of sat
and played and this was something that
worked out really well for me so wanted
to share that as well and my last tip
for you guys is to work out if you guys
don't have any fitness plans or any
different type of workouts that you
currently do not only is working out
beneficial to your health but it's also
gonna make you feel good it's gonna make
you look good and there's just a million
benefits to it so I definitely recommend
working out if you add different chest
exercises into your routine believe it
or not it's gonna really help build the
muscle under your boobs which is going
to help keep them nice and firm that is
one thing that I'll always do when I'm
at the gym I constantly do different
chest exercises I believe Bret has a
video on his channel of a workout
routine that we did Jim doing different
arms and chest movements so I will link
that below for you guys to check it out
also if you haven't worked out before
and you're just trying to get into it
check out Bart's channel because all
types of workouts for beginners and it's
just something I definitely recommend
overall not just to get your boobs
bigger but that is basically it as far
as my boobie enhancing tricks I hope
this video helped for some of you guys
out there these are just little tricks
that I've learned throughout the years
because my boobs have always been like a
normal size but I always wanted to try
anyways to make them look bigger without
having to get surgery so I'm not against
plastic surgery if you guys choose to go
down that route lucky you you're going
to have some nice big old boobies but
for me natural is the way to be ooh it
rhymed
so thank you guys so much for watching
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
until next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
