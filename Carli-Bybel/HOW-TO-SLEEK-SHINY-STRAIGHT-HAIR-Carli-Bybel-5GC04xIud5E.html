today's video I'm going to show you how
I personally straighten my hair I've
been training my hair for 10-15 years I
was born with really curly frizzy hair
so I have used everything from a real
clothing iron two different
straighteners I've tried literally
everything and I feel like I have a
really good routine down now that helps
keep out the frizz keeps it super
straight and silky and yeah so I had
asked you guys in my last video if you
wanted to see my routine and I feel like
majority of you guys said yes so if you
guys want to see how I personally
straighten my hair and then please keep
watching so the first thing you want to
do is brush out your hair make sure
there are no knots that's like the key
to straightening your hair so last night
I showered and then I put my hair to
braid and then it kind of just air dried
like this like pretty wavy and a little
bit frizzy so for those of you guys who
don't know I've gotten a few keratin
treatments in my lifetime my hair is
normally naturally super super frizzy
super curly so I have been shooting my
hair forever and I've been always trying
to find like new techniques that work
for me and I've just been doing the same
thing for probably about two years now
and just makes my hair super super
straight gets rid of all the frizz and
although the Cardon does help with the
frizz my hair is grown in a lot so my
roots are growing in like this much so
all around my face gets super curly and
frizzy so that's where I like to focus I
I feel like that's the most important
part for me if you notice certain parts
of your hair get frizzy or first those
are the areas that you want to work on a
little bit more and make sure you're
getting them super super straight that
way it less all night long so my hair is
all brushed out so I'm going to section
it off starting at the bottom this again
is another key trick to getting your
hair super straight if you're doing too
big of layers or if you're doing too big
of pieces you're not going to be getting
like all the frizz out of your hair
and you're not going to be getting all
the moisture out of your hair and it can
frizz up a little bit later on so if you
want super straight hair you have to pin
it up I know I've talked to a couple
people and they're like I don't want to
do my hair in sections like takes too
long but this is how I always do it it
just comes up the best in my opinion and
then that way you don't end up missing
any hair so you could see like the
bottom parts of my hair are completely
grown out I would say like to hear the
past like three times I only did it
right around in front of my face because
that's where it's the worst and I kind
of miss my curly hair a little bit so
I'm trying to grow it out so you can see
it's like frizzy down here and another
thing that I wanted to mention is from
having frizzy hair my whole life the new
technique that I've been doing that has
worked for me so well is to shower at
night bring my hair in a super tight
braid I'll even like smooth the front
down that way it's like almost straight
and then in the morning I take it out of
the braids and then it's air dried and
it's so much less frizzy and it looks
just really pretty so that's just
something that has really worked for me
so I wanted to share that with you guys
so now what I always do is I run my
finger to the back and then I bring the
hair to the front that way it's easier
to straighten so lately I've been using
this little guy this is from Bellamy it
came in like my 12 in one kit I recently
found it I started using it and I was
like how have I not used this my entire
life so it just makes straightening your
hair so much better when your hair is
brushed and nice and smooth it's going
to straighten your hair so much better
so as you can see when I clamp it down
and run it through there are no knots
and it goes directly through my hair so
what this does is as you straighten it
it brushes your hair and flattens it
that way the straightener can reach
every single point so I have my strainer
this one is so beat-up you can't even
see like what the temperature is so what
I always do is I clamp it like this then
I grab my Shriner and I just start
straightening
then when I get to the end I kind of
like curl it just a little bit so you
can see with just one little swipe it
already made it perfectly straight but I
always like to go over it like least
twice just to make sure it's perfectly
straight so
so now you can see it's nice and
straight so I'm gonna repeat the same
thing on the other side now
I noticed there was like a little short
piece that I didn't really get so
so the one thing that I'll do without
that little brush is I'll go over the
roots a little bit so although it may
seem like it takes more time to do
sections it actually will ends up being
quicker because you won't have to keep
going over the same pieces over and over
again because you're going to know any
piece that you've straightened is
completely straight and it'll be good
for a couple days I mean depending if
you're hair is greasy or not I can when
I shake my hair at last like two three
days sometimes so it's the same thing
with this layer we're just going to
bring it all to the front um
you can even brush it each layer just to
make sure that it's all brushed out
sometimes
switched when your hair is really long
it just gets really knotty at the ends
no matter how many times that you brush
it so I'm going to start with this back
piece
you wanna make sure you got all the hair
so you can grab it your sections as well
and the beauty of this show my went out
so yeah you just want to make sure it's
all straight like you can see there's
like oh look a little straggler that
annoying piece that I gotta straighten
but again the comb just really separates
the hair and it just helps the
straightener reach like every strand
which is awesome
never put the same thing on the other
side I'm going to start with the back
piece there once and then straight in
sometimes it hurts at the end because my
hairs so naughty
so again you want to make sure you're
going like these back routes because my
problem is always I like miss one of
those pieces in the back so just make
sure you're getting like all around the
rooms and we're just repeating the same
thing so I section it into four sections
total depending on how much hair you
have and how long is you could probably
even do three but um again I've only
been filming for probably like 10-15
minutes and I'm already almost done and
my hair super long so I feel like the
key is just make sure your hair is dry
um since you are using heat on your hair
I definitely I think sometimes you don't
have a choice you have to blow-dry it
and then strain it but if you wash your
hair at night let it air dry you're
using a lot less heat and I feel like
that has been the main reason my hair
has grown this long and also how it's so
healthy it's because I stopped using a
blow-dryer altogether the only time I
use a blow dryer is to just blow out
like the front pieces which usually
takes me like three four minutes tops so
I really really feel like that's one of
the main reasons my hair has gotten so
healthy and so long because I'm not
using heat on it like I used to so if
you guys have curly hair or frizzy hair
try my technique out let me know if it
works for you that is because as you can
see you don't need it to be like you can
see my hair is frizzy and like pretty
curly back here and you don't need it to
be blown out straight to get it
perfectly pin straight this I think
works so much better your hair feels
softer and again it's less heat damaged
which is key especially if you want to
grow your hair long and if you want it
to look super healthy so again we're
gonna start with the back pieces
straighten them I wasn't sure if I was
gonna film this video because I don't
know I feel like straightening your hair
is kind of self-explanatory I don't know
I've never post
and I've been on YouTube five years so
but I saw a lot of people who are
questing it and since I've been recently
using this little tool I figured since
it's been helping me so much might as
well give you guys a little tutorial
plus like I had asked in my last video
and a lot of you guys were saying yes
please show us so this one is for you
guys so again you want to focus on the
ends as well make sure you're curling
them under a bit making sure they're not
like frizzy or brittle at the end
for me this is one of my bad spots so I
like to take like a tiny little piece
like this much and make sure I can get
really really close to the root without
burning myself obviously but I take it
and I kind of like go like this in this
kind of motion and that just really
really smooths them down and it also
just keeps them straight all night so if
you don't focus on those parts and they
are a little bit frizzy those are going
to be the first ones to frizz up
especially if it's humid wherever you
are so just a little tip you never want
to hold the iron too long in one spot as
well because these things do get super
hot and then the final section so I
never liked a part like directly in the
center I don't know I have like a phobia
of it so I just do it like right off the
center I just feel like for my safe
shade by the pretty big forehead so I
just I don't know what I do Center I
just feel like it doesn't look right on
me so now that I've done all of the back
I'll just put it into the back that way
I don't get confused um you can using
clip it out of the way that way it's a
little bit easier and you're not going
over the same pieces over and over again
without realizing so I'm going to take
this piece brush it through and string
so I'm sorry it's taking all night a
Saturday to get a video up um me and
Brett both had food poisoning Sunday and
Monday so I mean we think it was food
poisoning it was either that or we had
like a stomach virus it was so weird
people haven't been sick in so long and
the fact that we were both sick it was
just like so we didn't leave bed all day
Monday and then I had a couple meetings
during the week which went really well I
can't wait to share with you guys what
I've been working on and then yesterday
I spent the day with my mom and then we
also went to dinner it was Brett's dad's
birthday it was also Brett's mom's
birthday on Tuesday so we went for
dinner and a little bit crazy on my own
but of course I wasn't going to go a
full week without good eat as a video
I'm also going to LA on Monday really
really quick trip just Monday morning
and then we fly home 6 a.m. on Wednesday
so the second part of my meeting that I
had on Thursday is going to be in LA so
that's why we're going just really
really quickly so that'll be fun
so I'm gonna have a video up on Monday
through Wednesday but as soon as I get
back you know I will have a video up for
you guys I hate not being able to tell
you like what I'm doing I really want to
tell you guys but you know as soon as I
get the word you guys are the first to
know as always so again with the front
piece I do the same thing I just grab a
little piece and I just make sure that
it's super straight cuz right here is
always where I get the frizzies frizzies
and also right back here if you don't
straighten it enough it could be like a
little poofy or for me if you poofy so
again we all have different hair so
everyone's here going to be a little bit
different so the last time that I
colored my hair I had some angles put it
in the front so I like to just kind of
curl them under just a bit just they're
not like going straight straight down so
you could see like how this is kind of
lifted and that's just because that's my
like curly roots so that's why you want
to make sure you focus on the top that
way it flattens out like so I'm just
going to like make sure under here is
super straight as well right by the
roots okay so I'm just going to unpin
the rest part it down the center again
bring it all forward and just make sure
everything is all straight
so next I'm just taking a little bit of
argan oil that's like two pumps I'm
gonna focus this on the ends you don't
want to get it too high off because you
don't want your hair to look greasy but
this will just like smooth out any like
split ends or any like frizzy pieces
that you want smooth so you can really
use any argan oil and then I have my
shine missed by dry bar this one was
from my favorites video and I'm just
going to apply a little bit I don't my
hair like too shiny but
and that is it that is how I get super
shiny straight hair it's really easy it
probably took me like 20 25 minutes max
it usually doesn't even take me that
long I feel like just cuz I was
explaining and talking guys through it
it's a little bit longer than usual but
again if you guys want really straight
hair that's gonna last and it's not
gonna frizz up try out my techniques try
out the different sections try out this
little brush let me know if it makes it
any easier for you guys I hope you
