watching so it's been quite a bit since
I have posted a haul or a drugstore haul
I believe the last video I did was my
all-time favorites from the drugstore so
in my town a huge Rite Aid just opened
up and I normally go right to the
Walgreens that's right on the corner
where I live but again a new ride a just
opened up so of course I had to go check
it out so the other day I went and I
picked up some new things that I saw
were on display and some things I
haven't tried so I'm just gonna
basically go through everything that I
bought and tell you guys how I like some
of the products because I actually did
my whole entire makeup look with the
drugstore products that I had used so I
found some really awesome products and
then I found maybe a couple things that
I tried that I really didn't like so if
you guys want to see my big drugstore
haul please keep watching so in all the
drugstores I have one of their loyalty
cards or whatever so they offer certain
deals that they wouldn't offer for the
normal person who doesn't get the card I
think it's free to sign up so I know
what Walgreens is like the balance
rewards cards and then Rite Aid has some
other type of cards so they have little
tags on the products saying it's like
buy one get one half off or anything
like that so whenever I see the buy one
get one half off I always pick up my
L'Oreal telescopic mascara because I
think they're about 10 11 dollars and a
lot of the times they don't have the
sales so if they do have the buy one get
one half I always stock up on them
because as most of you probably know
this is my favorite mascara so I came
across these little concealer sticks
from covergirl they are called the
trublend fixstick and this one is in
deep and normally when you see concealer
in the drugstore they only have like
three shades which is like really really
pale or like I think it gets probably
the darkest is this color but I saw that
they had these darker color so I was
like you know it that'd be really cool
if I could contour with these products
so to do my face today I actually use
this dark color this one is deep and
this color is medium light and I use the
stick to just draw where I wanted to
contour which we're on my cheeks around
my nose and I put a couple lines on my
forehead and then I use a big brush to
blend it all out
I'm loving how it came out so it's a
cool way to contour your face for those
of you who aren't really sure what to
use or you want to try out a different
product I definitely back it up and I
think it's a really cool way to do it
and it's easier because instead of using
a brush and a powder or a brush and the
different thing you can just take off
the cap and then just draw wherever you
want to contour and then with the
lighter color I just did wherever I
wanted to highlight so these are really
cool and I definitely recommend them I
will be using these I'm sure a lot to be
contouring my face so the next product
that I found was by Rimmel and these are
called to stay matte liquid mousse
foundations and most of these products
that I'm going to be mentioning are
literally right in the front of the
store they were on the display as like
the new products so as soon as I walked
in I grabbed like half the stuff from
there because they're all new stuff and
I've never tried them so what caught me
about these was it says stay matte so I
actually use this foundation underneath
the concealer Stix and I loved love the
finish of it it really was a nice matte
finish and it wasn't too thick it was
like a nice consistency it covered
everything it needed to cover and yeah
so I'm a big fan of these so when I was
in the store actually sampled a little
color on my hand to figure out what
color I needed and I ended up getting
ivory and true ivory because I was kind
of in between the two so again I mixed
these two I put them on my foundation
brush and I used it for my foundation
for this look right here and I'm loving
it so I think this is going to be my new
favorite drugstore foundation the Rimmel
stay matte so I definitely recommend
that along with that I've purchased the
stay matte long-lasting pressed powder
also by Rimmel and I use this to set my
concealer and everything and to be
completely honest I love this finish as
well I just used a big fluffy brush and
then I swirled it all around and then
put it all over my face and this I used
in place of my makeup forever loose
powder that I usually use so I'm a big
fan of this as well and it's so cool
trying out new products because if you
find something that could be your new
favorite I mean who would have even sunk
plus its rug store plus it's even
cheaper than say you're going to Sephora
something like that so I was actually so
pleasantly surprised with these three
products definitely recommend them
you guys do try these out let me know
how you do like it as well you do like
it I don't even think that's English
sometimes I just sit here and I'll like
ramble and then after I'm done I'm like
I don't even think that was proper
English another product that was in the
front was by L'Oreal this is the visible
lift CC cream and it's a concealer and I
wanted to try this out as well so before
I use the lighter shade of that
concealer stick that I had just
previously mentioned
I tried this instead and it was so
liquidy and thin for me when I'm looking
for a concealer I like to get one that
has a thicker consistency that is
actually gonna show up on your face and
really brighten up your face so I wasn't
really happy with how this one came out
I would say if you like very light
coverage and you're not looking for a
thick concealer maybe try this one out
but for me I probably won't be using
this one again just because again it was
a really thin consistency and I use this
and then I ended up using a concealer
over it to give it a more brighter look
so not a huge fan of the CC concealer by
L'Oreal so the other day I was checking
out at Walgreens and I was with my
cousin Danny and she ran off the line to
go get a new chapstick that she needed
because her lips are really chapped she
picked up the Baby Lips doctor rescue
which is like a medicated lip balm so of
course the other day when I went to Rite
Aid I saw it and I was like you know let
me try it out because I'm always in need
of a good medicated chapstick so I've
been using it and I really love it it's
just a clear plain chapstick but I've
had really dry lips this whole winter so
I apply it first and then I'll apply my
lipstick and I actually really really
love it so I mean I've only used about
three times so far but I think it's
awesome and yeah next I came across
these two highlighting palettes can you
see them okay they are both by Revlon
this one is peach glow and this one is
bronze glow it's cool because they're a
bunch of different colors in one so what
I used for my blood this one's not even
open yet but what I use today for my
blush was those bronze and this pink
color so I used a smaller contour brush
picked up those two colors and apply
them as my blush and then this top white
shimmery color I use to highlight under
my brows on my Cupid's bow and then kind
of right above my cheeks a little bit so
I actually really really like these I
didn't try
out this one yet the peachy glow but I
really love these so far and I think
it'd be perfect for the summer to give
yourself a nice bronzy glow or if you're
just wanting a nice glow in the winter
time definitely try these out they're
cool and they're great highlighters so
so if you guys have been following me
for a while you guys probably know that
the only bronzer that I've ever used
slash liked was the or is the Maybelline
no na Maybelline scuse me L'Oreal True
Match in cocoa and it's actually not a
bronzer it's a I guess the face powder
but I use it as a bronzer and I loved it
but when I was in Rite Aid I saw the NYC
cosmetics which I don't really have a
lot of those products and I came across
this color wheel mosaic face powder this
one is called the all-over bronze glow
and I used it again to bronze my face a
little bit and I actually really loved
it so I'm happy that I found another
bronzer that I like I always had trouble
finding something that was pigmented
enough to do what I wanted it to do and
I must say that NYC it's pretty
affordable and I'm a big fan of this
mosaic bronzer so I found another
bronzer I'm going to use so yay and I do
approve of it if anyone is looking for a
good bronzer while I was also in the NYC
section I found this double pencil thing
and the reason I picked this up is
because I've been looking for a nude eye
pencil for a while now just to use in my
waterline and I can't seem to find
anywhere so I actually used this to line
my inner waterline the nude side and I
really like this so I'm happy I picked
this one up I don't remember how much it
was the other side is just a plain brown
eyeliner but it's really good and I love
the nude side of it so by Revlon I came
across these colorburst matte balms and
I picked them up in three different
colors I'm wearing this pink one on my
lips and it was a little too pink so I
did use a nude lipstick over it so that
is what I'm using but I will show you
guys some swatches of this but they're
so nice they're like big crayons they're
really pigmented and yeah they're really
cool I'm actually a big fan of them I
feel like in the summer time I'll be
using these a lot because they're really
summery colors but they come out so
pigmented and really nice and I don't
know something about the crayon it's
just a little bit different and I really
do approve of these so again I'm wearing
this pin
one right now and then I just applied a
nude lipstick over it while on the
subject of what's on my lips believe it
or not I didn't use the tawny by Jordana
because they don't have Jordana at
rite-aid but I wanted to try out this
one by Rimmel and it's called innocent
and I actually really like the color
it's more of a nude as opposed to the
Jordana 20 which has a little bit of a
pinkish tone so if you want that really
nude lip look I really approve of this
one and I think it was like six or seven
dollars so it is a little bit more
pricey than the Jordana but I actually
really liked it this is the one that I
use for my lips today so in a few videos
I mentioned ooh open so in a few videos
I mentioned the Seabreeze astringent and
I literally use the last drop out of my
last one so this one I was just renewing
and I always like to use this if I see a
pimple coming along or anything like
that I just wash my face and then with a
cotton ball I apply this all over my
face and my neck and Bret always like
sees this as well so I really love this
astringent I've been using it for like
five six seven years now and it's really
affordable and I think it's great for
anyone who is looking for something to
help clear your skin I've been in need
of a pencil sharpener for literally two
years now I don't know why but it always
slips my mind when I'm out shopping so
you had something so finally I got
around to picking one up and I'm glad I
waited because this one was only $0.99
which is awesome it's by Wet n Wild and
it has the two different sizes in it so
it's perfect for the bigger pencils or
the smaller pencils and yeah it's only
$0.99 so that's awesome
also by Wet n Wild I picked up this
one's called idle eyes and it's a cream
shadow pencil and um I mean it's a right
if you could see it's not as pigmented
as I had hoped I had to apply a shadow
over it I used this underneath my eyes
um for the Ron Pope concert and then I
had to apply a shadow over it because it
didn't come out as pigmented I as I had
hoped for so now the huge fan of this by
wet and wild but I mean the color is
really pretty you just would have to
apply a shadow over it so one of the new
products by Garnier was also in the
front staring at me so I wanted to try
it out I haven't tried
it out yet but it's called the ultralift
transformer anti age skin corrector and
this was with the Garnier miracle blur I
know that's not what it's called but
that's what it's the same thing as the
L'Oreal miracle blur so I didn't grab
the Garnier version because I figured it
did the exact same thing as the L'Oreal
but I did pick this up thinking that it
was some sort of primer or something for
your face but when I got home I realized
that it's it's actually for sunscreen it
has it helps prevent sunburn if used as
directed with other sun protection
measures so this is actually just a
sunscreen I found out it's saying to
apply it 50 minutes before sun exposure
so I actually was a little disappointed
because I originally thought it was more
like a base or a primer because it says
ultralift transformer so I was like ooh
is this going to lift up my face before
I put on my makeup but I think it's more
of just a SPF to put underneath your
foundation more for the summer time but
of course if you are going to be outside
in any sort of light it's great to put
on SPF so this again has the SPF 20
haven't tried to get when I do I will
keep you guys posted another thing I
picked up from the drugstore was a
little mini Purell to put in my purse
I have a bigger sized one on my vanity
so whenever I'm about to do my makeup I
always like to use it but as I was
checking out in the front they had this
little sample size one and I figured
it'd be good to keep either in my car or
my purse so Purell is important you
don't want any germs on your face
especially when you're about to touch it
to do your makeup and everything like
that so it's really important either
wash your hands a lot or use Purell
another product that I love that is
actually from Walgreens I picked up a
couple weeks ago to refill it is these
little InStyle fragrances and they are
copies of actual perfumes this one is an
impression of Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana light blue
so it does smell like the actual perfume
and I don't know why I'm not huge on
perfume I haven't I don't really have
any really nice ones I have to go out
and smell a bunch and find a few that I
love but this is one that I just love to
keep in my bag or my car and just spray
on before I go anywhere it smells so
good and it really does smell like the
lake blue so I mean I'm not a big
advocate
knockoffs but if something is cheaper
and smells really good and you can buy
right at your a drugstore I mean why not
try it out right alright so the last
product that I'm going to be talking
about today are by Revlon these are
called photo-ready skin lights the
colors that I got them in were bare
light pink light and peach light so what
these are are highlighters I also
mention those highlighter pallets a
little bit earlier in the video but
these are more like a liquidy highlight
so what I like to do is put a little bit
put a little dot on my hand then tap it
and then just like tap the product and
then tap it onto my face and this is
going to give you a nice highlight I
like to apply it right on my cheeks
these are actually really cool the
reason I wanted to check these out is
because I do have a Mac version of them
and they're so similar and they did
exact same thing so I really love these
if you guys are looking for a nice
highlight and you don't want to try the
palette these ones are a great
alternative I think they're basically
the same thing this one will probably
just last a little bit longer since it
is more of like a liquidy highlight as
opposed to the powder highlight so I
guess if you want to try both out see
which ones you like better it's
completely up to you but I do definitely
recommend these and I know I'm gonna be
using this a lot in the summer even
though in the winter I don't know why
whenever I think of something shimmery
and bronzy I just automatically say this
will be perfect for the summer but I
mean any time of year if you're looking
for a bronzy or a pretty glow these are
great products so that was my most
recent drugstore haul I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I hope some of
you go out and try some of the products
and hopefully love them as much as I did
like I said there was only a couple
maybe that I hadn't tried out or that I
wasn't happy with I honestly think some
of my drugstore products are better than
some of my higher-end products so I mean
it's all about trying it out seeing what
you love and everything like that but I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and if
you try out any of these suggestions
make sure to tweet me and let me know
how you guys like them I love you guys
so much and please leave any feedback on
what you guys want to see next on my
channel I love you guys and until next
time
this way
student I'm
I know
whoa
all out of my
it's you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
