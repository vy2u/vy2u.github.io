before I get into today's video I just
wanted to say thank you guys so much to
everyone who went out and purchased my
palette I know it was pure chaos and
there was a lot of technical
difficulties so I do apologize for those
who try to get it who weren't able to
get it but I just want to let you guys
know that beforehand I warned BH that I
feel like it's gonna be a big launch
make sure you guys are prepared they've
done this before with many other
youtubers and they said that they were
prepared and they thought that they had
enough palettes that it wouldn't sell
out right away so we definitely proved
them wrong we sold out within hours of
it being launched so I'm so grateful and
so thankful for every single person I
also want to let you guys know that it
will be coming back I will make sure
that it's not permanently out of stock
until anyone who wants it can get it and
we also are keeping the price at 12:50
that way if anyone wasn't able to get it
you guys can still get it for the
amazing launch price deal so with that
said I'm going to get into today's video
which is going to be a huge fall haul I
picked up a ton of new stuff and I
wanted to share it with you guys I have
a lot of new websites I wanted to talk
about as well as some awesome new coupon
codes so if you guys want to see what I
picked up please keep watching so behind
me I have some of my new purchases
they're also mixed in with some older
stuff so I'm not going to be showing you
every single thing on this rack that
would just take way too long but I'm
going to show you guys a bunch of my
favorite new pieces that I just picked
up I bought a bunch of stuff from
forever 21
for my back-to-school slash fall video
where I did a bunch of outfits this
unfortunately did make the cut but I
just loved this sweater I thought it was
so so so cute it's a little bit fancy so
I think it can be really cute on the
days that maybe you want to take a
little bit more time to get ready and
get a little more fancy I would probably
wear this with like a pair of leather
shorts black shorts black jeans leather
pants something like that something with
black on the bottom but I absolutely
love this and I had to pick it up and
maybe it's not for everybody but I love
anything with like a fringe on it and
like just look at this the next item is
a long white blouse that is super
creased this is from misguided it's long
sleeve that has a low front and it's
really really long so you could either
wear it as like a
dress with the pair of leggings
underneath it you could put on a pair of
shorts you could put on a pair of jeans
really anything and it just gives it
like a really really nice like
business√≠ yet really chic look I
absolutely loved it on the model so I
had to get it and I can't wait to
actually style it with an outfit but
this is from misguided as I just said
I'm going to show you the picture of it
on the model so you guys can kind of see
how she styled it and also what it looks
like on another white top that I got is
also from misguided it's just a little
blouse that you could tuck in you can
wear with the skirt you can wear with
jeans you can make it super dressy or
you can keep it super casual and just
throw out like a pair of blue jeans with
it the next type is super cute it's from
ASOS it has a slit front so I would
definitely recommend wearing like maybe
like a pair of black jeans black leather
pants with this oh it would look so cute
together with just like a pair of simple
sandals and what's great is you can even
do leggings with this since it does
cover your little tush so it just
depends again how you want to style it
but I just love this fabric and this
material on super lightweight so you can
even throw like a blazer or a leather
jacket over it and a little super cute
so the next thing I wanted to show you
is this nude pencil skirt I actually
have a bodysuit that went with this it's
the exact same color so you can kind of
make it into a dress this is from
Zachary the label I mentioned this when
I wore that leopard bodysuit which is
over here this leopard one right here um
their website is amazing next up I have
this silk playsuit also from ASOS and I
just loved it as soon as I saw it was
just so my style I love how it has the
high neck the long flowy sleeves which
are just so cute if I were to wear this
I would definitely do my makeup to match
because it's just such a gorgeous like
taupe white color and I would probably
just wear like a simple sandal with it
nothing crazy but I just absolutely love
this as soon as I saw it and the style
of it is so me so I can't wait to wear
it these sleeves are just everything I
just love sleeves like this you know
what these sleeves remind me up have you
guys ever seen crossroads with Britney
Spears like 10 years ago
all her shirts that she wore with those
big sleeves seriously ever since that
movie I've been like dying or sleeves
like that next up I have this
I guess it's like a long blouse / almost
like a trenchcoat top it's really really
long but it does have slits up the side
so obviously you can't wear it as a
dress I would probably wear black jeans
with something like this and just like a
pair of black flats or even a pair of
black heels I just love how this look on
the model that's kind of my problem is I
see something on the model and I'm like
oh I bye it's and I look great on me and
that's the number one thing I recommend
if you guys are buying stuff online as
soon as it comes in make sure you're
trying it on because just because it
looks great on a 6-foot model doesn't
mean it's gonna look on you so that's
always been my biggest problem this I
just loved I thought it's so cute for
fall you can even wear like a
long-sleeve turtleneck underneath with a
pair of pants and then you're set to go
so just such a good color - I love nude
so next I have this long sweater dress
it goes down on like a little angle this
is from szabo skirt and actually the
shirt I'm wearing right now is also Saba
skirt isn't it um I got a coupon code
which I will list below as well for you
guys it's only valid for I think like a
week or two so this is one thing I
picked up along with the shirt that I'm
wearing and I think there's a few other
things that I have in here that I'll
show you guys so next I have this
gorgeous new dress it has buttons down
the front as soon as I saw this I
instantly had to get it I just
absolutely love this it's also from the
website Zachary the label so I do have a
code for you guys it's just really
form-fitting the main reason I love
Zachary's website is everything fits me
like a glove so you guys are really
petite I would definitely recommend
their site because made for petite girls
so I just actually love this dress it's
so gorgeous tight fitting and yeah you
can wear with like a blazer or a jacket
obviously in the fall time when it gets
a little bit cold but here in Jersey
it's been like 90 95 degrees still which
is just disgusting so I'm ready for the
fall weather I'm ready for the jackets
and the sweaters and scarves and all
that it's time next I have these
adorable cigarette trousers from Zachary
the label as well their stuff is just to
die for I love their pants they are
definitely made for girls who are petite
the cigarette pants are great though
because if you are taller if they are
a bit short on you it's okay because you
wear a nice pump with them and then they
look like they're supposed to be that
way but these just fit so nicely and I'm
obsessed next I have this sleeveless
trenchcoat looking thing it's from
forever 21 it's like a new dish pink
color the top is a thicker material and
then the bottom is almost like a sheer
um material and I love this I feel like
this with a white top or even like a new
top blue jeans and just like sneakers or
even like a pair of boots would look
really really cute I love the sleeveless
trenches last year I actually did a
fashion post wearing a sleeveless trench
I'll link that if you guys want to see
how I paired it but they just look so
cute and for me I always liked something
that's gonna like cover me during the
fall time so of course it doesn't have
sleeves it's not going to keep you warm
but it's more for style and this one was
37 dollars from forever 21 pretty good
deal a lot of people probably won't like
this but when I saw it on the mannequin
I was like I need to have it so this is
the other item that I bought from Free
People the other day the sweater I was
planning on wearing underneath it so let
me just show you guys really quick so
this is the sweater under it and it's a
long bell bottom Jean Robert so it
actually looks really cute on and it's a
little like farmerie but I personally
like it I feel like 70's style is so
back and it's so funny because my mom
was like I definitely had something that
looked like that when I was your age so
I just loved this romper I can't wait to
wear it I'm definitely gonna wear it in
a blog post soon again the free people
sites this was $120 so I'm sure you guys
can probably find something really
similar on forever 21 if you guys do let
me know when I'm linking all the
products that I've mentioned in this
video I will definitely see if there are
cheaper alternatives to some of the
products next up I have this blue and
white mesh top this is from the website
called shop akhira they have really
really cute stuff you guys gotta go
check them out the front is like a white
mesh print and it has a good Jean floral
design on it and I
love it because it has a high neck and
it's a tight-fitting top I just love how
this top fits and looks and I would
probably pair it with a pair of jeans
that are similar in color and you can
even keep it really casual throw on a
pair of sneakers or you can even throw
on a pair of heels and dress it up a
little bit okay so next I have this blue
it looks like Brett's shirt
like looks like a boyfriend's shirt but
it's actually like a dress from
misguided and it fits really baggy and I
actually love this so this is one I was
planning on wearing this with this was
probably gonna be one of my next blog
posts I'm sure a lot of people will be
like a listing you're wrong for jammas
but I like that style so it's gonna be a
dress it's gonna be loose-fitting and I
have these like gladiator high black
sandals that go up to like your knees
and I just thought it would look really
really cute and like different I don't
know when I buy things I envision how I
wear them in my head and that's just how
I envisioned it so I'm actually gonna
try it on and hopefully do a blog post
for you guys when it's not raining out I
was planning on doing one today but it
is literally like the most gloomy day of
life it was so hard waking up this
morning because our room was like pitch
black but I just thought this was so
cute and we'll see how it all looks
together hopefully it looks as good as
how I envisioned it in my head but it's
just I know something different so next
I have this pretty plain pretty basic
gray sweater it's from forever 21 I
bought this because I don't have
surprisingly I don't have just like a
plain throw over sweater like this I had
a couple outfits in mind that I could
wear this with just throw it on over
with like a jean skirt pair of jeans you
can tie it around your waist I think
it's just really good to have like a
plain colored sweater in your closet
that way on days where maybe you have a
really cute outfit but you have nothing
to keep you warm you can just throw this
right over it and I think it'll look
really casual but cute too like 12
dollars from forever 21 so that's why I
had to pick it up and it also doesn't
have that itchy material which is
another reason why I wanted it that was
a cute little sweater you can even keep
it in like your locker at school keys to
get really cold
um I know for me I'm either super super
hot sweating or I'm freezing and I need
to bring a sweater with me so this is
something that I'll just be packing with
me wherever I go this next outfit is one
of my favorites and I haven't
to get and I feel like it's kind of
summery but I don't know I feel like
IKEA where it was like a gray jacket
it's this gray long skirt and a cute
little matching crop top this is from
the website called fashion bunker which
is also an Australian website they have
all Australian designers on it so the
site is definitely a lot more pricey
than some of the others that I've
mentioned but again it's all Australian
designers so the quality is amazing I
got the skirt and the top in a size
extra extra small the reason for that is
there sizing is a little bit different I
have a bunch of clothing from these
brands and they originally only had
extra small and every time I would buy
something as an extra small I'd always
have to get hem because their sizing is
just very off so I guess a lot of people
were complaining about it and now they
actually came out with extra extra small
so now it fits me perfectly I don't have
to spend an extra money day on the hem
which saves a day um the brand cameo and
Finders Keepers for any of my big events
I always tend to wear their clothing
because they're a little bit extra
special in my opinion I actually may
wear this to my event that I have next
week which I also wanted to mention
really quickly um me and my good friend
Harish who is actually Kylie Jenner's
makeup artist we are having a huge
makeup seminar she has these all over
the world and we're having one right in
New York City at the Plaza Hotel tickets
are 250 dollars but that is because she
will be teaching a full two hour class
to you guys she normally charges a lot
more so I know for some people they may
be like oh my god that's too much money
but if you guys are an artist or an
aspiring artist you guys probably have
heard of classes like this and know that
that's actually a really good deal
there's going to be a goodie bag given
to every single person worth $600 which
is awesome and we're also doing a big
meet-and-greet for an hour before the
class starts so if anyone is interested
I'll list details below but it's going
to be so much fun and I can't wait to
meet some of you guys check out the info
below and you guys can see a little bit
more about it next I have just this
plain little t-shirt it's also from
forever 21 I got it because let's be
real majority of the time I'm living in
t-shirts and sweats and I know a lot of
you guys going back to school of course
it's nice to dress up on some days but
reality we love wearing sweats and
t-shirts so I wanted to include
I just love the quote on it that's why I
got it says don't hate what you don't
understand and you guys know how much I
love both so when I see a t-shirt with a
really cute quote on it I will always
buy it because I know I'll get a lot of
use out of it
and I just thought this was really cute
especially for those going back to
school I understand how hard it is with
the bullying and how people can be
really really mean believe me some of
you guys may not but I was bullied a lot
in school like a lot a lot I'd go home
crying so I completely feel you guys I
understand and I know how hard it is but
I just want you guys to know that life
after high school is going to be so much
better high school kids are just so
immature
and whatever any of them say just ignore
them and know that they are more
miserable with themselves if they are
taking out their anger on you so
sometimes it's nice to buy t-shirts to
remind yourself and to make yourself
feel a little bit better so that's why I
got this one this shirt was 14 dollars
from forever 21 so it's a pretty good
deal in my opinion and it's a little bit
of a loose-fitting t-shirt but I just
love it so next I have this amazing
sweater it's definitely one of my
favorites
this is also from szabo skirt look at
these colors mixed together like
obsessed I just love it I love it I love
it it's so warm and cozy and it's not
itchy whatsoever I live for sweaters
like this in the fall wintertime they
are just everything to me
I'm not exactly sure how much this one
goes for but I got it in a size small
medium and again I do have the coupon
code for 10% off szabo skirt for a
limited time if anyone is interested but
the sweater is just everything I can't
wait to wear it next up I have another
szabo skirt sweater
another sleeveless sweater as well this
one's a little bit more form-fitting it
does have an open back which is really
cute I do most of the time have a
sweating problem especially in the fall
in the winter because people tend to
hike up the heat so sweaters like this
are always good for me because it lets
you breathe while still keeping you warm
at the same time next I have this
gorgeous khaki green bodysuit it's also
from the website Zachary the label one
of the main reasons that I absolutely
love this bodysuit is you can see it has
like a really really long time
so these bodysuits are like the ones
that you can wear a bunch of different
ways it's hide around the waist you can
make it just look any way that you want
on their website they showed you a bunch
of different ways how you can wear it
which is so cool they have it in like
every single color so if you guys are
looking for a really nice quality
bodysuit this one's amazing it does have
a low back and yeah it's just so cute
and I'm obsessed with green this color
is just like next I have this green
bomber jacket from ASOS and it's very
light weight which is really nice this
one I love because it's form-fitting and
it's a great just plain sweatshirt to
just throw on whatever outfit if you
guys are getting a little chilly next up
I have this cute little floral blouse
from forever 21 it's black obviously
with some peach colored flowers I
thought this would be so cute with a
black skirt which I'll show you guys
because I have it right here also from
forever 21 it's like a little skater
skirt I thought this like tucked in
would be really really cute plus it's
super affordable which is always good
next I have this black jean jacket this
is from ASOS and it's just your typical
black jean jacket I actually didn't have
one beforehand I have been wearing my
actual jean jacket like a ton so when I
saw that they came out with a really
similar one in like a black color I had
to get it these are just great to throw
on over any outfit um especially with
the fall like sometimes I want to wear
like a cute tank top but I need a jacket
or a blazer to go over it and sometimes
we don't know where like a leather
jacket because it's a little bit too
heavy but something like this is
definitely more lightweight and more
realistic to wear maybe like inside
somewhere so you're not gonna be like
sweating dying but I just love this one
next up I have this gorgeous suede
chocolate brown dress from house of
Seabee is so cute I absolutely love that
website they are definitely a little bit
more on the pricey side but their
quality is amazing and the way that the
justice fit are just unbelievable and I
love the style of it definitely go check
out their website if you guys are
looking for amazing dresses if you have
a special occasion or something like
that that is like one of the number one
sites I'll go to if I know I need to buy
a dress or something a little bit more
fancy from the same site this is a
leather button-down top also house of C
be so annoying up every time I lift
thing up the lighting changes but
anyways this is also from house of
Seavey it's a leather button-down top
this would look cute with a black skirt
black pants really anything like that I
never owned a leather top like this
before so when I saw it I thought it was
little something a little bit different
and can't wait to actually wear it and
style it with something next I have this
black bodysuit
also from house of CB has a little white
fuzzy on it oh it's just amazing that's
really the only word I can use to
describe it I cannot wait to wear this
long-sleeve checkered print high neck
just right up my alley you can use these
for anything with a skirt with pants I
just absolutely love the style of this
so you guys aren't ready for this next
romper I don't know where I'm gonna wear
it but I saw it I knew I had to happen
in my closet it's so cute it's all the
little fringes it's a low front
literally fringes everywhere which is
just my life way too bright why I don't
know where I'm going to wear it
definitely out somewhere with probably a
pair of black pumps or something like
that but I can't wait to wear this I'm
definitely wearing this soon it's just
amazing and I love fringes like anything
with fringes give it to me next I have
another bodysuit this is also from the
website shop Akira it's just a striped
bodysuit um it is see-through so I would
definitely recommend wearing like a
little crop top like this underneath it
you could wear a black band o top or if
you're feeling a little bit frisky wear
a black bra you could do that too you
can wear them with those a wide leg
baggy pants which I love skirts black
pants really anything so love this even
like a black blazer over it I think
would be super super cute so last but
not least I wanted to show you guys this
little feather top that I got from
misguided how cute is it a little
feathers to be honest it's annoying it's
already shedding but I just thought it
was so cute and so different and I
really like statement tops it is a crop
top so I probably wear it with like a
black high waist skirt or black
high-wage jeans um I feel like whenever
I wear black I always tend to stick with
like all black which I feel like looks
good on everybody so that is
it I think that's enough right you guys
probably think I'm absolutely crazy for
having all this stuff but I love to shop
plus I feel like I got to keep you
updated on what's in style or what I
feel is in style so I hope you guys
enjoyed this haul let me know if you
guys want more of these because I'm
always shopping and I'm always picking
up new items I love sharing them with
you guys because sometimes with the blog
and the blog posts there is a lot of
time in between I don't get to wear
everything so it's fun to just show you
guys and give you different ideas for
your own shopping time so I hope you
