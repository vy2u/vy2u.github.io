those of you guys that don't know my
name is Carly and today I'm standing in
my closet because I did a little
shopping I was good for a couple weeks
but I went a little crazy and I got so
many things for spring so I figured I
would do a try on haul for you guys it
has been quite a bit since I have done a
fashion haul so I figured I would show
you some of the items that I recently
picked up as well as talked about some
of the trends first spring this year if
you are not already subscribed to my
channel please do so by clicking the
link below it's on this side so if you
guys want to see some of the items that
I picked up then please keep watching
so this first shirt I just got in the
mail about four days ago I actually
pre-ordered this probably like two
months ago and it finally came so I'm
super excited about it it's from the
brand I am Jia it has like a really 90s
vibe to it which I'm sure you guys have
already noticed the 90s are back hence
my shirt 1990 I was born in 1990 so when
I saw this shirt I obviously had to get
it but I really love this brand I am Jia
has really cute fashion-forward pieces
some of the items are like super EXTREME
and you'd be like what when would I even
wear that but I feel like they're ahead
of the trend so what you're seeing on
their site you're gonna start seeing
like and all of the other retail stores
pretty soon so next up I have this cute
two piece from misguided it's the
Madison beer X misguided collaboration
I love the Pinstripe details this type
of pattern is also super big this year
and what's cool about this little outfit
is you can dress it up or dress it down
if you want to wear sneakers with it you
can wear it during the day or if you
throw on a pair of heels you can
definitely dress it up as well there you
get away from the can dog he's just
gonna sit right in front of my candle so
if you guys know me you know cropped
things are like my specialty I picked up
this little crop top from misguided it's
just beige and white really simple but
you can wear it was kind of it
thing my go-to in the spring as long as
it's warm out are like ripped jean
shorts I have one pair that are like my
go-to they fit me so nice no matter how
many times I wash them they never get
too tight they never stretch out too
much so I always like to find like key
little crops that I can wear with them
so I had to pick up this little guy as
well try stop it next up I have this
beautiful flowy crop top it's also from
misguided I love the color of it it's
super 90s this shirt kind of gives me
Britney Spears crossroads vibes have you
guys seen that movie I swear I've seen
it like a hundred times it used to be my
favorite movie and quick little story
time me and two of my best friends when
we were in fifth grade we made like a
little memory box and we put a bunch of
pictures and all kinds of stuff in that
box and then I'm going to graduated high
school we dug it up and it was like the
coolest thing ever so obviously we were
inspired by that movie but yeah Britney
Spears was just everything in the 90s I
mean she still is everything but that
movie was definitely one of my favorites
and there's this shirt and not remind
you of her like the big flowy sleeves so
now this bad boy oh it's just so
beautiful so extra
I got a 50% off because I'm Scott it
always has 50% off so if you're shopping
and you have a bag full of stuff
and they're not having a discount wait
like a day or two because they always
have 50% off which means don't ever pay
full price so this is from the peace and
love collection it's like a huge kimono
with like beautiful draped sleeves you
can wear this over say like black jeans
and like a plain top or you can wear it
over a bathing suit if you want to be
super extra which is kind of what I
planned on doing it as obviously if I
were on vacation I would wear this if
I'm going to the beach or like my aunts
pool I'm not gonna be wearing something
like that so next up I have this cute
little two-piece that is from revolve
clothing as well sometimes when I order
things and then it comes
like look at it in the packaging and I'm
like why don't drink what are this but I
tried it on instantly and I fell in love
I love the flowy details of the pants
they're super airy and they're a little
bit creased right now because they are
brand-new but obviously if I were to
wear this I would be steaming it but I
love how they're like open in the front
so when you walk it's like you're a
supermodel and you're just like flowing
in the wind so next up can you guess
what we have another two-piece this I
just couldn't resist honestly like the
color I just have like this severe
obsession with matching separates and
this skirt it just fits so nice its
high-waisted with little cost details
down the front it has a zip up the back
and it has like a little like ruched
fabric and then for the top it's a one
sleeve and it is a little like Rowlett
type of top but since the skirt is high
waist you can totally get away with it I
am planning on vacation soon and this is
definitely gonna be top on my list of
what I'm gonna be wearing it's funny
because every year for like spring
trends like they try to make things that
have already been a thing like new and
exciting but on all of the magazines and
all the websites that I was looking at
like pastels are huge for spring which I
mean that's a given every year they're
huge for spring also floral so like you
have the florals in this two-piece next
up from misguided I have this ribbed
midi dress it goes down below the knees
which I love it's super basic and simple
but I love these types of dresses
because let's be real if you forgot to
shave and you wanna wear dress because
it's warm out this dress is perfect for
you it's just so gross but I have to be
real I mean in the summertime that's
like the one thing I look forward to the
least I've shaved my legs I get out of
shower an hour later I swear I already
have stubble my hair just grows back so
fast so besides the fact that I love how
these dresses fit my specific body type
I feel like they make me look a little
bit taller especially with a pair of
heels they're perfect for those days
where you want to stay cool but you want
to cover them legs so next up this was
something random but I don't know why I
felt the need to purchase it Barbie X
misguided it's like this cute little
Barbie sports bra type top and when
their did their original collaboration
with the Barbie I was like I would never
buy something that's in Barbie on it
it's just not my thing but something
about this outfit just spoke to me and I
just felt the need to have it in my
closet they say Barbie like kind of
small on the leg and then we have Barbie
Barbie Barbie Barbie Barbie maybe I'll
wear my blonde wig that everybody
thought was real with this outfit I'm
surprised that you guys liked it I
thought when I posted it I would get so
much hate but everyone seems to really
like it which is funny so I'm thinking
maybe I'll do a video with like the wig
on and then you guys can tell me what
you really think because you know
snapchat filters always make everything
better so next I have this super cute
romper from revolve clothing this is the
Michael Costello X revolve collaboration
so obviously I had to support my love
and besides the fact that I wanted to
support him this jumpsuit just is insane
the color is absolutely gorgeous these
bold colors are really big for spring as
well and I just love how flowy it is I
always look at his page I'm like I want
every single thing he ever designs and I
was randomly browsing on her evolve and
I saw that he's into collaboration so as
soon as I saw this I instantly how to
get it so another big trend for spring
this year are polka dots which is super
exciting because I love me some polka
dots so I can't find my bra in the
smaller size so don't mind the bra
showing but yeah so I picked up this
cute little crop top I feel like
everything is cute and little and a crop
top I don't know why I just my whole
life I just described everything that's
little um quick little funny quick
little funny story I was away on
vacation with my best friend mu when we
were thinking like 8th grade 8th or 9th
grade and we were away with her parents
obviously
and I was in the shower and I didn't
have a towel so her mom her name is
Joanne you call her Jojo I called her I
was like Jojo can you get me a little
towel because at this point like
everything we said was little this
little this so she hands me like one of
the little hand towels so there's a
picture of me that exists somewhere in
my house and I'm like standing there
with like this little hand towel
covering like just my boobs and my
bottom and I was like Jojo not a little
towel like I meant a real towel but I
just called it a little towel so she
ended up giving me a little towel so she
was literally on the floor peeing
because she just thought it was the
funniest thing ever which it was because
that's what I get for calling everything
little SH I asked for a little towel so
she gave me a little towel I'm sorry I
just can't help some of my vocabulary it
just comes out naturally moving on to my
favorite section so yellow is so huge
this year which is super exciting
because yellow is my favorite color
yellow and pink but I really really love
yellow so I picked up this shirt along
with this one from misguided I'll
probably like knot it in the front and
wear it with some high-waisted something
because that's all that I wear and the
reason that I personally have loved
high-waisted items for as long as I can
remember I remember actually I think it
was sophomore year in high school me and
my best friend mil we bought these
high-waisted pants when the thing that
was in were like those super super low
cut pants and it warms up partying and
everyone made fun of us but we just kept
wearing them because it made us look
taller make sure legs look longer I
always always wear high-waisted
basically everything you will never see
me with anything low-cut so next I have
this fringy jacket and yellow I love it
fringe is in for spring and it's so
funny because sometimes my mom will be
like that is so in and I'll just be like
is it is it so in and Here I am saying
same thing so I'm just as bad but it's
so funny but anyway fringe is a huge for
spring and that excites me because in my
world fringe is always in style so when
I saw this in yellow I knew how to pick
it up and then my last yellow item that
I picked up this one I definitely
couldn't resist
it's a beautiful yellow maxi dress with
polka dots so you got your bold color
and your polka dots
I love how flowy it is and again it's
the color
I feel like this color is gonna make you
look way tanner than you actually are
which is super exciting and yeah I just
love it I guess what another crop top
this one I love it's super 90s it has a
little American flag on it and I love
like the trim around the sleeves and the
neck this I would definitely wear with I
keep looking down because I just got a
new pair of shorts and like I mentioned
earlier there's like one pair of shorts
that I got like six years ago and I went
to buy a second pair of them and they
came and they're completely different
just got these from our vows they're a
little bit pricey but I bought them in a
size 24 and a 25 and the 25 fit
perfectly everywhere but it was so big
on my waist like crazy big so I put the
24 on and they're a little tight on my
butt but I know jean shorts always
stretch out so I'm gonna give them a
chance so this next two-piece as soon as
I saw it all I could think about was
pretty woman and that's definitely one
of my favorite videos ever so I had to
get it plus suits are huge for spring as
well I love a good polka dot pattern
shorts with the ruffle waist and then we
have the matching blazer so this color
is like this burnt orange and it's not
something I would normally gravitate
towards but it was just very different
and I haven't seen anything like it so I
would definitely wear this with some
sort of white tank top I keep this one
short and sweet it's red and white
stripes and
his girl gang on it but I love it and
then I have a red mini dress also from
misguided it has a ribbed fabric but I
love the color red it makes a statement
so something as basic as this will
really stand out so you could totally
dress this down with like a little jean
jacket and a pair of sneakers or you can
wear it out at night and put on a pair
of like lace-up sandals and you can even
still wear the jean jacket so you can do
like a date and night look with
something like this so another trend
that's really big right now is like that
whole NASCAR look which is kind of weird
but I kind of love it
and I would definitely wear this with
like black either black jeans or
something black on the bottom but you
know what I can even probably wear this
with something I'm about to show you in
a minute though this little two-piece I
picked up I just thought it was so cute
biker shorts which are really really
popular I have them in so many colors
and they're so comfy so check your print
shorts and a matching sweatshirt so I
know this is so random and I'm sure some
of you guys are gonna hate it
but oops but I don't know why I'm kind
of like living for this print so what do
you guys think would you wear it guess
No comment below let me know another
crops t-shirt this one I love because it
has the little rose on it it says
eternity I love it super simple had to
have it so that is it for my big spring
fashion haul I hope you guys enjoyed
