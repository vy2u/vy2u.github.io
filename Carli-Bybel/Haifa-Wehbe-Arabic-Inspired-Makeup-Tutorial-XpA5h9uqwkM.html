you
you
be my
thank you for watching so today's makeup
look is inspired by hateful webby and
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that
right so if I'm not I do apologize but
she is a Lebanese singer and actress and
she's absolutely beautiful and I've seen
so many requests from you guys to do an
Arabic style makeup or makeup inspired
by her so when I was looking through the
different pictures you sent me this one
was definitely my favorite look I just
recently got this headpiece in the mail
from ASOS I will link it below and it is
so beautiful and I was so excited when I
got it and I figured this is a perfect
time to do the makeup look inspired by
her so if you guys want to learn how to
get it please keep watching and I will
show you how to prime my eyes I'm using
Laura Mercier concealer
first color I'm taking is the champagne
color from my Maybelline pod and I'm
applying this all over my entire eyelid
the next color I'm using is by Stila and
it comes with this little liquid jar and
this is going to help bring out the
pigment of the eyeshadow so I just apply
a little bit to my brush and then I dip
it into the shadow
next I'm grabbing my Mac 224 brush and
this bronze color from the same
Maybelline quad and I'm applying this
right in the crease of my eye
you
then from my BH 120 palette I'm picking
up this darker brown sparkle color and
I'm applying that right over the bronze
color in my crease
next we're going on to eyeliner I'm
using by L'Oreal de gel liner in black
for this look you really want to extend
the inner part of your eye so what I did
was extend it and if it's not perfect
you can always just grab a q-tip and
wipe away any of the mess that you made
because again this part is gonna be a
little bit harder
also for this makeup look you want to
extend your tail a little bit further
than you normally would if you need help
making it perfectly straight you can use
anything with a sharp edge for instance
my eyelash glue I'm going to be using
the sharp edge of that
next I'm just applying false lashes
which I had already cut and I'm just
applying them to the outer part of my
eye and this is going to extend my eye
and give it that more narrow Arabic look
once you've applied your lashes you're
then going to apply your mascara I'm
using my L'Oreal telescopic as usual and
this is going on the top and bottom
lashes
going back to the BH 120 palette I'm
taking up this turquoise color and I'm
going to be lining my lower lash line
this color is going to go as close to my
lash line as possible
right underneath that color I'm going to
be picking up this bright purple and
lining underneath the turquoise line
you're then going to want to line your
inner lashline with this dark black
color and this is just going to finish
off the eye look to line my lips I'm
going to be using by Jordana cosmetics
my lip liner in tawny
and for gloss I'm using the color your
smile by whitening lightening and nude
and last but not least I'm just going to
be adding a little beauty mark to finish
off the look
so this is the final look I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and remember you
can always switch the colors underneath
to make it your own but until next time
I'll see you guys later so much love
in between
