want to check out her website I'm gonna

basically she's in a competition right
now and all that you have to do to win
this contest I'm giving away two elf
pallets there are hundred pallets
there's I've used them in a lot of my
videos there's a hundred different
colors so there's gonna be two given
away to two winners if you want to enter
the contest all you have to do I'm going

you're gonna do is you click the link
and it's going to pull up to her
Mixcloud competition is basically

most hearts which are likes she gets
flown to Miami Florida and she said I
think open for Swedish House Mafia or
something really exciting like that
so she's from Sweden so basically it's
her life and it would mean so much to me
if you guys would just it takes two
seconds just click the link click the
play button click the little heart and
then you can comment me below and tell
me that you did it and then I'm going to
do the contest winners like I did for my
previous one and again it's the two elf
palette so I use them in almost all my
videos so it's gonna be a really easy to
follow along if you do have what I'm
using you know you mean so that said can
you want the hair tutorial basically I
wash my hair every three days I have
really thick curly hair like I've said
previously so my hair never really gets
Gracie so I can last three days without
it looking bad if you have greased your
hair and you have to do it every other
day that's fine it they do say it is
better if you don't wash it as much but
I mean if you have oily hair you can't
really help it you don't want to be
walking around with like Gracie what I
use is by L'Oreal it's by V it's called
V Pro it's neutral off mirror shine
shampoo and it's from medium to long
hair that's damaged this is what it
looks like this is the shampoo and then
the conditioner
right here basically this is the only
shampoo and conditioner that I will use
I've tried so many different brands and
I mean my hair I don't know I feel like
ever since I've used this my hair really
does look a lot shinier and another
thing I love about this is my hair I
like love conditioner
I love conditioner love conditioner so
every time I wash my hair if I use this
it feels really really soft I feel like
that's a sign you know you have a good
conditioner if you get the shower and
your hair is like dry and just doesn't
feel nice and you know that whatever
you're using isn't working for your hair
this will make your hair feel like
amazing amazing any this any Walgreens
any CVS um I actually ran out and my and
I threw at my garbage so I don't have
the deep conditioner that I use but I'll
put a link to where you can buy it below
you know the brand of it it's a little
blue one it's like a Moroccan argan oil
deep conditioner and like I said I
really dry hair so basically every time
I shampoo and condition my hair I use
deep conditioner in between washes if
you have like I said the greasy hair if
your every if say you wake up in the
morning you do your hair and then at
night it's like greasy again you're like
why's this happens to me I highly highly
highly suggest batiste it's um a dry
shampoo
it's really awesome all you do as you
shake it it's a good spray can like this
you shake it and you spray it like this
far away from your hair wherever it's
greasy and once you sprite in you're
going to massage your scalp let it sit
for comments and then just brush it
through and then either blow-dry your
hair like style as usual and it really
does make a big difference it does make
your hair look not greasy anymore I
guess cuz I think it's something like I
don't know if you've heard if you use
baby powder in your hair like soaks up
the grease or something along those
lines but the it's really good the
batiste I love this one
when I get out of the shower when my
hair is still wet before I brush it I
use john frieda frizz serum goodbye this
also at Walgreens and I put about a
dime-size amount maybe even a little bit
more excitable out of hair rubbing your
hands and I focus on the ends focus all
the serum on the ends because if you put
them too close to your scalp it can make
your hair greasy before you blow-dry
your hair I've
said this in my past two tutorials that
I showed where how I blow-dry my hair
you need to use a heat protectant
this one's called this one's by Chi it's
called silk guard at some moisture
therapy and what it does it just um
helps prevent your hair from any damage
or or the really like high temperatures
so spray this all over your entire head
if you have like I use a lot of products
you guys probably think I'm crazy if you
want more body in your hair when you're
blowing it out and either if you have
thin hair or if you have thicker hair
and you just want your hair to stay up I
suggest a root lifter in this product
before its matrix its amplify you just
spray this like I basically spray it
right around this part of my head
just make sure roots actually like say
lifted and it keeps the body all day
once I'm finished blow-drying my hair I
also have another serum this one is
called liquid shine it's by a brand
called New York streets my sister used
to work for them so I had a bunch of um
samples this is equivalent to like a bio
bio silk you can get like the serum one
of my favorite serums that I actually
just ran out of is by brilliant brunette
and it's a shine shock therapy that's
the thing look that's what it's called
it's in a brown bottle and it's the same
thing it's all just like a shine serum
you could take a little bit again and
rub it through your hair put some end on
never too much it makes your hair really
shiny again you just want to focus this
on the ends sometimes before I go to bed
I'll just put a little extra in my hair
mom sleeping just cuz I don't know I
overuse products I think they tell you
to use just a little amount and I just
use as much as possible and then I have
one more product to show you guys this
is for all my older viewers this is the
coolest thing ever I don't personally
use this clearly because I don't I'm not
losing hair but if you have like
thinning hair or if you have a maybe
like a little bald spot or your hair's
thinner in one place I don't know if you
guys know about this stuff it's called
spray-on hair it's by um Jeremy Jeremy
Russell this is what it looks like
basically if you have like a bald spot
and you shake it you can buy whatever
color as your hair you spray and I
promise you this stuff looks so real
I've used this on
people before and I'm not going to say
who because that's just mean but like I
promise you it really makes like the
world of a difference this you could buy
I think in any beauty supply store so if
you're a little self-conscious about
like a thinning spotter and you think
that this will be your new best friend
so try that out as well so that's
basically it for my haircare I think if
you were to I know I I know I always
suggest a lot of products I'm sorry I'm
just like a freak with all this kind of
stuff so I love like way way too many
things but if I'm going to recommend
buying anything it is the shampoo and
conditioner again it's the vivre Pro by
L'Oreal thank you guys so much for
watching I hope this helps out I know
you guys have been asking for a while
what my hair care routine is so
basically that's it and again remember
if you want to enter the contest to win
a elf palette 100 color palette which is
awesome I love it
all you have to do is click the link
