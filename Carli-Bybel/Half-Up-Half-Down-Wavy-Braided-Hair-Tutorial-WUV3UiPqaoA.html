today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this way the braided hair style I
absolutely love how it turned out and I
think it's great for the spring and
summer time I'm counting down the days
till spring and it's starting to feel a
little bit like spring here in Jersey I
think it's been like 50 degrees so hey I
will take it but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and if you want to learn how
I got this hairstyle please keep
watching alright guys so the best time
to do this look is on Daniels hair two
day old hair and the reason for that is
because the waves are gonna stay in a
little bit better your hair is gonna be
a little bit more coarse it's not gonna
be so silky
I just blow-dried my hair I think it was
two days ago now so it is a little bit
silky but we're gonna be doing some
loose big waves in our hair to start off
this look the first product that I'm
going to be using before I go in with
the hot iron I'm going to be using by
Schwarzkopf the crystals shine and hold
heat protectant spray since I am using a
wand that gets up to 440 degrees
Fahrenheit it's so important to use a
heat protectant spray this one is great
on dry hair so you just want to spray it
evenly throughout your hair to give it
nice protection you don't want to make
it too wet you just want to make sure
basically the whole thing is a little
bit damp so the first thing you want to
do is section off your hair we're gonna
be creating some loose waves so I always
like to start with the bottom and then
work my way up so before curling it just
make sure you brush your hair through
and make sure there's no knots
for this look I am using a medium-sized
curling iron and I'm just going to be
creating some loose waves all throughout
my hair when you're doing the waves I
like to leave about this much out so
it's straight at the bottom that's gonna
give it more of a wavy texture instead
of looking like a normal curl now once
you feel the heat coming through you're
good to go
so once you've completed each side I
like to spray it in between just so they
don't fall out too much I'm using also
by Schwartz of the biotin volume and
texture hto free hair spray
okay so I just added some loose waves
all throughout my hair I was focusing
mainly on the bottom half the front
pieces are I'm gonna be putting back in
a braid so they're not as wavy as say
the bottom so I'm just finishing it off
with a little bit more hairspray next
product I'm using is also by Schwarz cup
and this is these satin for its control
and protect wax powder in my last video
that I did for Schwarzkopf I mentioned a
different type of powder that was really
good for adding volume into your roots
to really give you a nice root lift this
one is a little bit different this one
I'm going to be applying to the ends of
my hair what's great about this product
is it adds texture but it doesn't take
away the shine and it also helps protect
your hair from any humidity from getting
frizzy or anything like that so I'm just
gonna be taking a small amount into the
palm of my hands and I'm gonna be
working it into the bottoms of my hair
when you start rubbing it together it's
so crazy because it goes from like a
powder to a wax formula it's honestly
amazing I don't understand how it works
but you're just gonna work it in just
use a little bit as you go and to see
how much you actually want but it's
really magic I really don't understand
how these products work they're so cool
so again just rubbing it together and
then just working it into the bottom to
create some more textured waves this
stuff is gonna make your hair look so
beachy and it's gonna make the waves
look a lot more natural as well so
that's about all I need for right now so
now I'm moving on to the fun part
it's gonna be a half up half down a
braided look and the way that it's gonna
work I'm gonna turn around so you guys
can see really how I do it but one more
product that we are gonna be using to
help keep the braids looking nice and
sleek and keeping all the little
flyaways in I have a lot of really short
layers so when I do braids sometimes I
can look super messy which it's okay if
you want to leave it messy that works
too but I'm going to be using the
crystal shine and whole transparent
polishing pomade this stuff is
incredible I've used it so many times
already when I use this for mostly is
when I like to slick my hair it really
holds your hair down perfectly I'll do
another video if you guys want showing
how to do
but I'm just gonna be grabbing a little
bit with my fingers as I'm braiding it's
gonna be a lot easier to grip the braid
and it's also gonna give the brand nice
shiny finish so if you guys don't have a
lot of highlights it'll really kind of
stand out so I'm gonna turn around so
you guys can see this better starting
off this look I'm gonna be grabbing the
front piece of my hair basically right
above my ear and I'm gonna be starting a
Dutch braid so what this means is each
strand is gonna be going under the
middle strand instead of going over it
like a normal French braid I have a
Dutch braid tutorial that's more in
depth if you guys want to see that I'll
link it below but I'm basically just
grabbing a small pieces of hair and I'm
going right across the back of my head
since I did apply some extensions you
want to be careful not to have them show
too much so just grab little pieces and
start braiding it around and then once
we get to the other side I'll show you
how to turn it around to make it go back
the other way
once you get to the other side right by
your ear you're gonna pull the front
piece into the braid and then we're
gonna kind of make a u-turn and go
around and then back across so you just
want to make sure again to have the
front piece back so it's like a half up
half down and then you're just gonna do
the same thing pulling pieces and
wrapping it right underneath the first
braid
and once you've gotten back to the other
side you're just gonna fasten it with an
elastic I'm using one of these little
ones you can pick up right from your
drugstore and you're just fastening it
and there you go you have a nice pretty
half-up half-down braided look just to
loosen up the braids a little bit I'm
gonna start pulling them out just to
make it look a little more dramatic and
also to hide my extension track that you
can kind of see a little bit
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I think this
look is so perfect for springtime I'm so
excited for the warmer weather to
finally get here I've always been so
obsessed with braids but this is
something a little bit different that I
think would be amazing for the spring
and the summer time braids are so in
this year and I just really love how
this looks turned out so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and until next time
I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
