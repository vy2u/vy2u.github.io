forgive hi everyone thank you for
watching so I know a lot of you guys
have been requesting a heatproof slash
summer makeup tutorial and ever since
last summer I was shopping around trying
to find one product that I could really
recommend for your face for the
summertime because with a lot of the
foundations even if they're not too
light they can feel very cakey and once
the weather gets really warm if you're
outside the last thing you want is it
dripping down your face so I'm gonna be
showing you guys how I would do a hot
long lasting makeup look if I were going
outside somewhere like the boardwalk or
great adventure' or a concert or out to
lunch something like that I wouldn't
recommend this look for the beach or
anything like that so don't get this
confused with a quote-unquote beachy
tutorial so I hope you guys enjoy and
I'll see you guys soon
also all products details and everything
is going to be on my blog and I have a
direct link right below so definitely go
check that out I'll talk to you guys
soon so I don't know about you guys but
where I'm from it gets super super hot
in the summertime and last summer I
learned my lesson and I learned that you
can't just wear your normal makeup on a
hot summer day unless you want to be
wiping off all the makeup and having it
sweat all over you and yeah it's just
not a good idea so I actually found
these last summer they're the BB Creams
by Smashbox and I've used them in a
whole bunch of my tutorials and the
reason that I love using this for the
summertime is because it has the SPF in
it so you don't even need to apply your
lotion it controls your oil which I have
very oily skin in the summer time I
always get it really bad around my nose
and also my forehead so this also helps
control the oil and when you put it on
it doesn't feel like you have cakey
foundation on it's like as if you were
putting on a tinted moisturizer so I've
been using this like I said for over a
year
my color that I usually use is called
light/medium but I'm out of those right
now so I definitely to go get a new one
but the ones that I'm going to be using
I'm just mixing light and medium because
I do have both of the other shades so
when I'm tanner I have this one I want a
paler at this one so I'm just going to
mix the two I'm going to put the lighter
colors under my eyes and where I would
normally highlight and I'm going to use
a darker color around the rest of my
face if you want to achieve a more
contoured look you can do the two
separate colors like how I'm doing it
but if you do want just one plain shade
um they work just as well even when
you're applying it it does feel like
cool on your skin meaning like cold not
like feels cool yeah it it really goes
on really nicely and it feels like
you're putting lotion on it doesn't feel
like you're putting on foundation I'm
just going to take a tiny bit of the
darker color and just apply that around
the outer part of my face because this
color does make me look paler than I
already am I haven't been to the beach
yet this summer
got to get my tush out there you just
want to also drag that down onto your
neck so again there's no sharp lines
there was a lot of outdoor parties that
I went to last year and honestly this BB
cream saved my life so once you apply it
it literally feels like you have nothing
on your face which is so nice it doesn't
feel thick at all and it is a nice light
coverage I am a concealer hoarder I love
concealer and I don't know it's just so
amazing but one thing with the warm
weather is you do notice that the
concealer starts to melt
off a little bit so I'm just going to be
applying a little bit of concealer and
one thing I notice is throughout the day
if it's hot out or if I'm sweating I
will just have to kind of smear it in a
little bit here and there just so it's
not cakey looking so this part is
optional if you guys don't have any dark
circles or you don't want to use the
concealer that's completely fine I just
have darker circles under my eyes and
shadows on the sides of my nose so I
like adding a little bit of concealer to
brighten up my face I'm just using my
finger because again we just want a tiny
bit of concealer we don't want as much
as we would normally use in a regular
video
so for me the next step would be to just
take a little bit of a loose powder to
set my foundation and the concealer and
I know for a lot of people it's going to
be like oh my god if it's hot out I'm
not wearing any makeup but there are
days where it's hot and you want to look
put together and you want to have makeup
so this whole technique is just going to
make you look like barely their makeup
but it's going to also be sweat proof so
I'm just going to be taking a tiny tiny
bit of pressed powder just smallest
amount and that is just again to set
everything so when you step out in the
Sun it's not going to be all slimy and
it's not going to be slipping all over
the place so you're just going to take a
tiny bit of powder and just very lightly
brush on your face like with this brush
I barely even touch my face with it that
way we don't have to worry about
anything moving around like I said maybe
a little bit of a concealer yet you
might have to wipe away a little bit but
other than that this is really going to
help set it and keep it on so since the
weather is warmer I'm going to just be
assuming that some of you guys have a
little bit of a base pan so I'm going to
skip the bronzer for this look and I'm
gonna go straight to my long-lasting
blush this one is legit a long wear
blush so it's meant to last all day and
I've used these multiple times and these
were the ones that actually I've noticed
stayed on the longest throughout the day
so I figured I would include this one
because if we're gonna be sweating we
want something that's gonna be known for
being long-lasting so I don't have to
keep reapplying anything all day because
that's what's gonna help make the
cakiness this one is a peach color told
peachy dream and I keep switching
between this one and there's like a
Pinker color and I'm loving loving
loving these so you're just gonna smile
and then apply it right along your
cheekbones since these come out as a
powder you just need a little bit on the
brush because they do come out pretty
dark
and you're just going to go back to your
original brush and just kind of very
lightly blend it in next I'm just gonna
be applying my mascara then I'm going to
move on to my lips
I'm just outlining my lips with they
only lip pencil I ever use for lipstick
I'm just using this one by Smashbox and
this one is also long-lasting that's why
I did choose it and this one is like a
new dish pink color and it's actually
called nude but it is a little bit more
pinkish it will last you all day and it
will out stand the heat so this is the
final look and this is what I have been
doing and what I plan on doing for any
super hot day that I want to pull myself
together of course if you're going to
the beach or anything like that I don't
recommend doing this it's way too much
it's just I would recommend this if you
were going to the boardwalk or if you're
going to great adventure or maybe even
like out to lunch or dinner and you're
going to be outside it's a very flawless
look but it's going to have a very
minimal amount of makeup so it's not
going to be clogging your pores and
making you feel like you have a lot of
heavy makeup on so that is it and I hope
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
soon
