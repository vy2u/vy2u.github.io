and he said would you mind sitting down
for a while and talking to me I'm
feeling a little
she said I'm off in an hour and I know
where we can go
hi everyone thank you for watching so I
wanted to do a fall hairstyle and I came
up with this messy braided bun look so
if you want to learn how to get it
please keep watching and I'll show you
how in this tutorial I'm going to be
using a bun maker by Conair you can get
this at any drugstore and the first step
that I'm going to be doing is spraying
the front of my hair I'm using Loreal
Elnett satin hairspray and also a
smoothing brush and I'm just gonna
smooth my hair back to prepare it for
the ponytail I'm sure most of you know
how to do a high ponytail but if you
don't you're just going to now smooth
your hair back up into your hands and
lift it upwards smoothing up as well so
there are no bumps sometimes to get my
hair really smooth and really tight I'll
have to try this maybe one or two times
but once you get it as tight as you want
you're then going to take an elastic and
wrap it around try and get it as tight
as possible if you're unlucky like me
and you have any flyaways just spray
them down and you can even brush them
down that way you can make sure this
hairstyle lasts all day
if you guys are anything like me and
lose all of your bobby pins and swear
that there's like a black hole in your
room I get these ones by Connie oh they
come in a little jar so it's just a lot
easier to keep them organized if you
have any bumps these will press them
down and once you're done with the top
half you're going to spray underneath
and again smooth underneath and pin it
where necessary because you want
underneath to look just as good because
once we put up our hair in the bun you
will see it now taking your bun maker
you're going to wrap it around your hair
and push it up against your hair tied
next you're gonna flip your hair and
smooth your hair around the donut
keeping your hair in the position of how
it should be in the bun you're gonna
grab a small section of hair and you're
gonna start braiding it once you get to
the bottom you're going to use a very
small elastic you can get these again at
any drugstore and also if you've ever
had braces and you had those rubber
bands you can use those as well
in this fun I did the same thing with
five strands of hair so I had a total of
five braids
if the braids are a little bit too small
and you want them to have more of a if
the braids are a little too small and
you want them to have bigger in the bun
you can just pull out the little strands
one by one and this is gonna make your
braids a little bit wider
next you're just gonna pin your hair and
as you pin it down you're gonna want to
make sure that the braids are in place
as to where you want to see them
we can California then real Emily told
her all its heart might be the
all the things he was so scared of when
it's getting counter up over here and I
close my eyes see
I'm to pinda and got your desired shape
you can just spray the rest and make
sure everything's completely smooth
using this Conair bun maker it
definitely made it a lot easier for me
to achieve the results that I wanted I
love how this messy braided bun came out
and it's perfect for the fall you can
wear it to school or you can even wear
it for work I hope everyone enjoyed this
look and thanks so much for watching
I'll talk to you guys soon
