today I'm here with Brett and we are
gonna be going through a couple gift
ideas for guys for the holiday season so
we're basically gonna go through gifts
ideas for your brother for your dad for
your grandpa your boyfriend for your
husband for me for him right is that all
the yeah cuz then anyone who's a guy cuz
I know for me I wish I would have seen a
video like this because I always get so
confused and I never really know what to
buy so I guess we're gonna just go
through each person and then he'll give
what he suggests and then we can give
options of what we've given guys in the
past so if you guys want to learn what
they are then please keep watching so
why don't we do grandpa's first cuz
that's kind of easy for us at least yeah
yeah right no first no you go first okay
I'll go first so I got my grandpa well
we got my grandpa dinner and movie date
so we got him a gift card to the movies
and a gift card to a restaurant and he
took his girlfriend out and it was
really nice but I would just suggest
he'd be going for something that brings
up good memories of you and your grandpa
because that was something me my grandpa
did a lot when I was a young kid just go
to the movies so I know it really hit
his heart in a good way for the holiday
yeah he was more thing was because we
also celebrate Hanukkah so we did some
of our gifts already yeah one thing that
my little cousins got my grandpa this
year which is also something me and my
sister always did when we were younger
is get those sweatshirts with the
pictures you can put any kind of picture
on it and then a saying so I don't know
if you ever seen them they usually have
those stands like in a mall or something
like that and you can just put like a
cute little picture of you guys and say
like we love Grand power we love Papa
and I don't know my papa
always loved that he's such a little
cornball I love him so much but he would
totally wear one every single day if he
had it just to show off his grandkids
but so I think that was a cute idea
anything like he said like something
that reminds you of him that he'll
really like touch his heart I mean my
Papa when he was younger he loved going
to the track because he loved horse
races and everything like that so what
we used to do also is just give him some
side money it's a go just put aside for
the track and he
that also yeah things I'd like to do you
know just make him happy
that's all that matters and sometimes
even just a card is good they like
they're more about yeah it's let's move
on to uncle Lucas everybody has that
uncle either that drinks a lot so you
can get it maybe like a old scotch or
something you know like maybe like a
bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue something
like that or you have an uncle who's a
big sports buff right so you want to get
him his favorite team but get him
something cool you know likes nothing
that's just gonna go up on a wall that
he's not gonna be able to see so maybe
he could bring in his office something
he could put his beer in on a Sunday or
because his drink sir
those are just ideas that wouldn't
normally go across somebody's mind I
feel like so yeah that's why I'm saying
because you just kind of think if you
think about it you're gonna think of a
good present so yeah it's got to give us
some thought like when we went into that
sports store yeah everything everybody
everything no I was just saying I love
sports saw like you know coming into her
family know all of her family is so
loving and they want to get any presents
for every holiday we celebrate even like
you know Columbus Day I was getting
presents yeah but regardless it's like I
would have been happy with anything
Chiefs anything Mets regardless of what
it was think about their passions and
get them something that like really
doesn't have a price whether it's a
dollar a hundred dollars a thousand you
know what I mean I know owning a rainbow
but I'm just saying okay oh yes well
always sometimes it's hard it really
just depends on the person
yeah hi guys I'm Seahawks yeah I know he
loves my uncle of the Seahawks oh you've
gotten everything from like a blanket to
but she got me a you got me a beautiful
coat and wool well good I was gonna say
he loved the coat but you wouldn't think
oh yeah yeah yeah she got me a really
nice like the leather sleeved trench
coat my uncle tried it on and he was
like literally loving it so my first
work that we know yeah so like things
like that you know what I mean sometimes
if you're not sure ask a question but
don't give it away or ask maybe you know
your aunt or cousin or something yeah if
you have a sibling and you're not an
only child it's good to always team up
together and get like a gift together
that way you don't have to both go out
and like try and find something little
mean you can put money in and get them
something a little bit night
sir so next we're gonna talk about
brothers and cousins and he's probably
gonna do most of the talking because I
have no boys my family will actually no
excuse me
I have one little boy in my family he's
seven so more recently I've been able to
get four cousins but brothers and
cousins he is like everyone's boys on
his family so what do you usually do for
your brother brothers so for my brothers
I'm not really much of a shopper those
guys hate it yeah I can't stand like
just shopping and lines and all that but
regardless what I really always have
done is just basically think about what
my brother's like at the time obviously
year by year things will change and
interests will change but really focus
on what they've been you know doing like
the past year things that they like or
things that they express to you that
they like and then I would kind of
correlate it towards that as far as a
gift so I have nine grandchildren I'm
one of nine grandchildren's you have
nine grandchildren I'm one of nine
grandchildren and I was the second born
so it's always been like me buying my
little cousin stuff and then I've always
just had my older brother so it's always
us team up together to really buy
everybody else stuff like foreign stuff
it's always been sports stuff I don't
want to keep the trend but it's really
has I'm you know come from a family that
loves sports yeah outside so I've always
bought them sports stuff like this year
we bought them sports I put some fish
yeah when iTunes was like brand new I
used to get them for their iPod just
like I can gift cards simple stuff you
know even coffee gift cards one of them
just got their license I'll get him some
gas gift cards something that you know
that they'll be able to use when I first
got my license the best thing anybody
could have gotten is like a gasket or a
gas card because gas is abnormally high
and then I think in like every single
category that we talked about so far I
mean we're still gonna continue but I
feel like comfy pajamas pants what
you're wearing right now like fleece
come peebs you have my pants our
slippers right don't all guys love goofy
slippers and we're like socks mm-hmm so
little and it depends on the person how
much do you want to
so moving on to Dad's what the heck can
you get your dad you got to know what he
likes and every year you've had the
opportunity to get him what he wants so
you know maybe if you got him a bad gift
in the past that you shouldn't get him
at my dad's and love it do up and I
remember as like a kid I got him like
the same gift every year and I remember
he'd be like oh this is awesome that I
know in the back of my mind I like this
kid doesn't understand you get me the
same gift yeah I get it like the best
that do-wop you know are something like
CD from and you probably yeah it was a
good CDs in one and then we gotta make
the sopranos book one yeah oh yeah yes
they love the show yeah the show like
well the Sopranos book I don't know if
this book I'm sure there's books but
yeah I think what we've gotten my dad in
the past we did this for my grandma and
grandpa this year but you I know you
were thinking of doing that with your
brothers - what we did was me and my
sister Brett and then her boyfriend we
all chipped in and then got a like a
cute little flat-screen TV for their
bedroom like nothing crazy nothing huge
but they needed a new TV because they
had like the one with the VCR still in
it little TV my grandpa doesn't have
yeah so we just got them like a nice
little flat screen for the room and my
grandmom was tipped over she was like oh
she loved it but that's a great idea you
were gonna think to do that for your dad
yeah I was gonna dad for my dad but I
know my dad needs a lot other stuff like
my dad express stuff that I even over my
fitness stuff you wanted to start like
losing weight so I got him I'm getting
him all stuff to just like lose weight I
got him a suit where he could sweat a
sweat suit I got him a couple things for
the inside the house cuz he has a treble
in his room you know he wants to stay
healthy he's doing a good job so I'm
just gonna reward him with all that I'm
gonna make it rain exercise products on
Christmas all right so why don't we move
on to spouses because this one's
probably gonna be like not really the
most important but we're gonna have
probably a lot of ideas and I know a lot
of girls were asking like why do I get
my boyfriend like we just started dating
or we've been dating a year so why don't
we go through some gifts that we think
is a good idea for like a newer
relationships that you just started
dating you don't want to spend too much
money because you don't really know if
the glass but you like him blah blah
blah blah so let me think of what the
heck today when I had done I was just
thinking so do you know what his
favorite can
is because I think what would be cool is
if you like got like a bag and like
filled it with his favorite candy and
then maybe put like something else on
it's like whoa yes you're like what can
we put underneath that bag akkanee like
a new relationship well for instance
like when we first started dating last
Christmas music this actually run this
time yeah what I did was early Christmas
present which was like why are you doing
that like why do you I don't need this
listen the funny girls we need to do
this you need to find something really
ugly that you know he won't like like I
took this old scarf that was actually my
it was a woman's scarf and I rocked it
really nicely in tissue paper and then I
put it in the bag and I had his real
gift underneath it but so he opened it
and he opens the scarf and he's like
looking at he's like oh this is so nice
I'm like you love it I was like do you
love it because it's so nice after he
pretend that he liked it I was like all
right baby I was actually just kidding
so keep digging there's actually more in
it so it's fun to just play that little
game on them because it's funny to see
their actual reaction to opening up a
gift that they actually don't like but
they have to pretend that they like so
that was cute how you act like you liked
it but I actually got him Knicks tickets
so I knew he liked the Knicks and I mean
there weren't any crazy seats or
anything but I thought that would be a
nice fun gift and I think if your
boyfriend or husband loves any sports
teams whether it's like hockey or
basketball football is almost over at
this point but I think it'd be cool to
buy them a ticket to the actual game
because I mean right is that not one of
the best gifts yeah because it's an
experience yeah you're going to watch
the game but then you have like dinner
before if you want and you just have the
whole experience and the memories of
going to the game and I think that's a
good because you hate you she doesn't
hate sports but I was just like wow wow
this is like I know you don't want to do
this it's like me buying Keith Urban
tickets I don't want to go we went to it
I did go to rest flats return what sir I
think what a rascal okay okay so
speaking of sports tickets you can do if
they like jay-z or if they have a
favorite artist
no no no I'm just gonna say since you
did sports tickets make sure you know
they'll buy you you know your tickets
later you said that's a dozen yeah like
oh you know sports tickets though but
then also it's a gift that you get to
enjoy as well yeah think something that
we've continuously said our he's
continuously said is that you have to
feel the person out obviously if you're
dating them you know what
like so I mean not everyone said I love
sports tickets but I originally was
gonna get him a watch I just figured
that he would probably like the sports
event better and then when we after he
actually opened I asked him if he would
have preferred this watch and was like
no no no no like this is so much
brighter we get to do do the experience
not saying how the watch isn't good
because for some people they may need a
new watch and I think a really nice
watch is a great idea that watches her I
mean awesome yeah obviously I think have
you been dating someone for a while and
you've already done like the watch and
the sports tickets and yada yada yada
like this year I got him I mean I'm
gonna be getting him probably something
that I'm not obviously gonna say but I
got him a couple pair of sweatpants
because I know he loves sweat pants so
got him a couple like v-necks just cuz
stuff he needs stuff that he wears all
the time you know like underwear I mean
that's a given like just like little
things like that that you know that he
needs socks and socks are fun gift too
because I recently socks I just become
like the next big thing Ducks are here
sub ducks recently like this socks you
know a bad I'm like a new hiked out
thing so I would maybe get something
Superman back yeah like I got Superman
socks that was an awesome baby on my
grandma no your aunt yeah so yeah so for
socks some socks some socks still run
through of just like a bunch of all the
things that we've listed like just good
ideas for guys period gift cards
dinner movie years Pep Boys yeah stuff
for your cars if you have a cousin or
maybe a friend or brother in your car
but for your car you know you have a
cousin or your brother just got a new
car or licensed carwash gift card
carwash gift card stuff for gas cards
yes I know that's toilet to rack up
board stuff anything from mature Z
signed baseball sports tickets
what sign baseball no no one wants that
anymore
yeah someone may want that if you're
watching this and you know someone that
may want that Tom but - hush so I know a
lot of the things that we've been
mentioning have been like things that
you have to spend money on of course
there is some people that really have a
lower budget and they don't want to buy
everyone gifts so one thing that me and
my sister
when we were younger because of course
we didn't really have our own money we
used to make little coupon books for my
dad like good for one massage or good
for one neck massager good for one date
to the movies or something like little
like that something that you can
actually put some thought into it or you
can just hand make a card anything
handwritten you can do like a scrapbook
I don't know somebody looks like that I
got that my dad got that for me or made
that for me for my football in high
school and Pop Warner like kept all my
pictures of things that's like something
gift like maybe like a grandpa scrapbook
of your family's yes vacations or
something you guys do traditionally you
know so don't think you have to go out
and spend all this money make someone
happy I mean as we said like it depends
on the person but if you have a budget
anything handmade I'm sure that person
would appreciate I mean it's not all
about how much did you spend it's all
about the thought you put into it and
the time and the energy and yeah alright
guys so that basically sums up our gift
guides for the guys in your life I hope
we helped a little bit do you think we
helped yeah I think we had some good
options yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed
