that you just wanna give away it's okay
to open up go ahead and let the lad show
hi everyone thank you for watching so
it's been about a year since I posted my
last highlighting contour routine a lot
of things are basically the same some of
my techniques have changed but I have a
better camera better lighting and I just
wanted to show you guys an in-depth
tutorial on how I would normally
highlighting contour because a lot of
the makeup looks that I do have I just
show how to do the eyes so if you guys
want to learn how to highlighting
contour like it is right here
then please keep watching for foundation
I'm using the magic nude liquid powder
by L'Oreal and sun beige you want to
make sure to shake this really really
well before you apply it and I'm going
to be applying this all on the outer
part of my face when highlighting and
contouring I don't like to put the
darker foundation anywhere near where I
want to highlight so again this is just
going all around your face and also on
your neck
to highlight I'm using prep and prime by
Mac in light boost and this is just
going underneath my eyes on the tip of
my nose
between my eyebrows my chin and I'm
going to be blending it in with my Mac
188 foundation brush
to contour I always use this dark brown
matte color from my brow bar it's the
perfect Brown I use it to fill in my
eyebrows and
you
then what I like to do is extend a line
from my eyebrows down to the bridge of
my nose and this is the start process of
contouring the nose to make it appear
smaller
you're then going to extend the line
down the natural curves of your nose and
I just bring it around my entire nose
underneath and then I drag it back up
and of course it's gonna look silly with
just a line but later on we're going to
be blending it all in to make it look
natural and to make it look like the
shadows of your natural nose
what I like to do is smudge it in with
my fingers and now that I have the males
it's extremely easy to do this and
you're just going to smudge in the lines
next we're just going on the contour
brush that same brown color and we're
going to be applying this on our
cheekbones if your cheekbones aren't as
distinguished and you're not sure where
to put them just kind of suck in like a
little fish and you'll find where the
lines should be when contouring you also
want to do your forehead you want to do
underneath your chin also you want to
blend in the nose a little bit with this
brush
for concealer I'm using by Laura Mercier
and I'm using this Mac flat brush to
apply it it's a lot easier when using
this type of brush because it's going to
give you perfect straight lines which is
gonna in turn make your nose look
perfect and like a non-surgical nose job
and we're just going to be also applying
this underneath our eyes and underneath
the sides of our nose
you
taking this concealer brush from Sephora
and then just going to be very lightly
blending all of this in
to set the concealer I'm using my makeup
forever the HD High Definition powder
then I'm taking the darkest Brown and
the middle brown color with my Mac
blending brush and I'm just going to be
extending that line that I started from
my eyebrow and I'm going to be adding
this color right into the crease of my
eye
that's why fireflies
some songs you can't help but just sing
along with but for blush I'm using this
light pink color from my BH palette and
this is just going to go right on the
apples of my cheeks so this part is
optional but I like to add a little bit
of a highlight sometimes and I just
apply this nice cream color from Mac
right on the tops of my cheeks basically
and yeah I just like to dab it on like
this so this is the final look and I do
this all the time when I'm going out
obviously for a day-to-day look I don't
use all of this makeup but it does
really do a difference for your face it
slims your nose Slim's your whole face
and I just love how it comes out so I
know a lot of you guys have been asking
for an update a lot of the products like
I said are the same as they were but the
techniques have changed a little bit so
I hope this video helps and make sure to
subscribe and like if you want to see
more videos see you later guys
I am so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
