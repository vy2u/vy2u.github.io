maybe I can find
hi everybody thank you for watching I
just wanted to say thank you to everyone
who had posted a very sweet comment
yesterday they really made my day and I
promise no more negativity and what's
done is done
so I just wanted to do a tutorial today
for you guys a lot of you have been
asking how I highlight in contour my
face so I'm going to be showing you
step-by-step how I do it and some of my
products that are more expensive I show
drugstore alternatives that I've used
and then I personally like so please
keep watching and I will teach you how
to season the first thing that we're
going to do is a ply a foundation primer
I'm using the one by Smashbox it's a
photo finish and it's oil-free my other
alternatives are by Laura Mercier their
foundation primer and also by L'Oreal
this is the magic perfecting base and
you can get that at any drugstore to
apply my primer I'm going to be using my
Mac 130 foundation brush and this is
definitely one of my favorites I love
the short bristles I love that you can
use this for multi purposes you can use
it for your primer you can also use it
for your foundation or you can use it
for a powdered foundation as well I'm
taking a small amount of my primer and
I'm just going to be applying it all
over my entire face
next I'm taking a yellow prep and prime
highlighter light boost which could be
compared to the Maybelline cover stick
in the color yellow this is going to
correct any dark spots or any dark areas
on your face and I love applying this
underneath my concealer because it's
going to help keep under my eyes nice
and bright
besides under my eyes I'm going to apply
a little bit on my chin on my nose and
also in between my eyebrows again to
highlight these areas this part is
optional but before I rub in the prep
and prime I'm going to be applying a
little bit of the Dream Lumi touch
highlighting concealer by Maybelline and
it's a salmon color and the reason that
the salmon is really good for underneath
your eyes because salmon really cancels
out the dark circles on your eyes so for
me I don't have very bad circles but if
you have darker skin definitely try a
salmon color concealer to rub these
colors and I'm going to be using my Mac
I believe it's number 188 brush and it's
pretty similar to my other one it just
has longer bristles and this one I love
for blending and stuff like this because
it's not going to blend it in deeply
into my skin it's just going to smooth
it out while still leaving the
highlighter on my face
next taking my Mac 224 blending brush
and the color espresso by Mac I'm just
going to be accentuating this line right
here and this is going to be the first
step of contouring you're just going to
be applying this color right along this
line as this place will feed me master
so I've been contouring for a while now
and this brush is definitely the best
buy Mac it's number 109 and it is made
for contouring and throughout this whole
time I'm going to be using that same
espresso color with this brush I'm just
going to be using a little bit of that
color and doing small circular motions
blending in that line and blending it
upwards and this is going to help create
definition in your cheeks
when contouring your cheeks it's a lot
easier if you randomly smile I know it
looks funny and it looks like I'm
probably smiling at myself but I promise
you it's just my technique
if you watch any my other foundation
routines you would know that my L'Oreal
True Match in the color cocoa is my
favorite bronzer you can get this again
at any drugstore and I'm going to be
applying this with that same contouring
brush from Mac and what you're going to
do is you're going to be applying this
right starting at the line and blending
it upwards this color is a little bit
lighter than the actual first contour
color so you're just going to be
blending it in and it's going to create
a very nice blended look with this
bronzer you're also going to be doing
the sides of your forehead and also you
don't want to forget your chin and also
on your neck
going back to the same mac brush I'm
just going to be very lightly blending
in everything I had just done it's
really important that you blend all this
together because in some lighting you
will be able to see some of the brush
strokes so using a brush like this very
lightly is going to be perfect for that
the next step is the fun part
I'm taking my Mac 214 brush and it's a
little smudge brush and I use this to
contour my nose a lot of you are asking
how to make your nose appear smaller and
this is how you're going to be taking
the same espresso color and very
carefully you're going to draw two lines
on the sides of your nose and also
you're not going to forget to do the tip
of your nose and what this does it's
going to add shadow onto your nose so
it's gonna make it appear smaller I know
a lot of you are asking if I had gotten
a nose job or anything like that and if
you do look back into my older videos if
my nose does look a lot smaller but it's
all because of this wonderful amazing
contouring trick
now that I look really funny and looks
like I have to stripes down my nose I'm
going to be taking my Mac 224 brush and
I'm just going to be blending in those
lines one thing I'll do to make this
look as natural as possible is I will
connect the top lines into my eye shadow
into the crease so if I have a light
beige color right in my crease I'll just
connect that right into my note and it
makes the contour look perfect at this
point you're probably like what else can
this girl do to your face but I'm just
taking my first Mac brush that I was
using the shorter bristles and I'm just
gonna be blending in just so again
there's no lines so now that we've
finished contouring we're now going to
highlight I'm taking by Laura Mercier my
secret camouflage concealer in the color
s3 and I'm also taking this brush by Mac
it's number 120 no 191 sorry the letters
are rubbing off but yeah you're just
going to be applying this right onto the
sides of your nose and I just got this
brush and I never knew what the long
skinny ones were for but honestly to
contour it's so easy because when you're
applying this on the sides of your nose
it's already going to make your nose
look even more straight and perfect
because the way you're applying it it's
applying in a perfectly straight line
you're going to be blending it downwards
and you're going to be creating the
upside down triangle from the bottom of
your nose all the way up to the sides of
your eyes
you're then going to take a little bit
on your finger and just apply this right
down the middle of your nose and also on
the bottom of your chin and then the
middle of your eyebrows and again this
is just going to be highlighting the
parts of your face we're almost done I
promise I'm going to be using my Mac
prep and prime finishing powder a 1 very
comparable is by Maybelline it's a
mineral veil and it's just the a
translucent powder and this is just
going to set your concealer and this is
going to help prevent any of those lines
or your concealer creasing next apply
your favorite blush my two favorites are
Maybelline peach satin and Mac gleeful
and I'm using my Mac blush brush and
it's number 123 and this one is
definitely my favorite for blush I love
that it's nice and fluffy and when I
apply my blush I just Pat the blush
right onto the brush as so and well if
you smile you could see exactly where
the apples of your cheeks are and you're
just going to be applying that I dab it
on instead of actually swiping it on for
lipstick I'm using my favorite nude
lipstick by Mac which is called creme
Zee nude and I'm also using by
Maybelline it's the baby soft lips and
it's a pink chapstick color and if you
mix these two together it's a perfect
color
ah
and that is how I personally contour and
highlight my face I hope you learned a
lot and I would definitely recommend
this for a nighttime look perfect for
the fall time I hope you enjoyed and
thank you all so much for watching I
will talk to you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
