did a vote on my Facebook page what you
wanted to see first whether it was hair
care or how to curl your hair in the new
picture that I had just posted if you
didn't yeah go check out my facebook
page it's beauty by Carli bybel and hit
the like button please and then that way
you can have a little insight on what
you want to see next so if you like how
my hair looks please keep watching I'll
show you how I got this if you like my
peekaboo highlights keep watching till
the end so I can show you how I got them
first you're going to want to tie up
your hair and leave a small section
underneath when curling your hair it's
always important to do small sections at
a time and start from the bottom up
it's always easier to pull your hair to
the front when curling your hair before
you start to curl you're going to want
to make sure your curling iron has gone
for a few minutes so it's extra hot
first you're going to take a section
about this small brush it through with a
comb so you make sure it's completely
smooth lifting the clamp you're then
going to take your hair and wrap it
around the curling iron once you wrap it
around all the way you're going to shut
the clamp so that way it heats up the
hair from the top and underneath as well
be careful when you're doing this
because you don't want to burn your
fingers I've done this many times and I
promise you it hurts so do not burn your
finger as your hair is wrapped around
the curling iron you can test out a
piece if you feel the heat coming
through the hair that's when you know
the curl is ready you're then going to
slide the curling iron off your hair and
you're gonna get a perfect curl
I just curl it back up with my fingers
and I pin it with a bobby pin
that way it cools off and then the curl
holds a lot longer
you want to repeat the same step for all
the hair on your head feel free to do
the curls in opposite directions when
you're doing it that just gives it more
of a natural look to it
again to make sure that the hair is
ready you can test out a piece and then
you feel the heat coming through that's
how you know it's done
so again you're going to pull your hair
to the front and brush it out and make
sure it's completely smooth
I didn't want to completely bore you and
make you watch me crawl my entire head
so now I'm just up to the top part of my
hair because this part basically the
front pieces I do a little bit different
than the rest of my head
you
you're gonna part your hair wherever you
normally do and smooth the two pieces
down you're then going to take the one
piece of hair and take the curling art
and you're going to want to curl it away
from your face that way it's easier to
blend in with the rest of your curls
next you're going to repeat this on the
other side holding the curling iron in
the opposite way so again you're curling
away from your face
next take any hairspray of your choice
mine is a very lightweight hairspray
because I don't like my curls being
sticky you're now going to remove all of
the bobby pins in your hair
when you first take the bobby pins out
your curls are going to be really tight
your hair's gonna look really short I
just use a brush and I brush the curls
out that way it loosens them a little
bit and it also makes them more fluffy
again throughout the day your hair is
going to fall so I like doing the
smaller curls that way about in the day
I know my hair will still be curled
a lot of people were asking about in my
last video how I got the highlights or
the peekaboo highlights or what you
would call them what to tell your
stylist well as you can see I don't have
them right now because mine are just old
extensions that I had died a caramel
color basically I just wanted to lighten
up my hair to make myself look more like
Jessica Burciaga in my last video so if
you want the highlight and you don't
want to actually ruin your hair you can
do it I did and just use a pair of old
extensions so if you just wanted to add
some highlights kind of like I did all
you're going to do is you're just gonna
clip them underneath your hair
this will just lighten up your hair a
little bit
my hair actually used to be this light I
can't even believe it so much darker now
and then you do the same down the other
side
now you have peekaboo highlights without
actually ruining your hair so these are
fun to just put in your hair if you're
going out and you want a little change
it does make your hair a lot thicker so
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
