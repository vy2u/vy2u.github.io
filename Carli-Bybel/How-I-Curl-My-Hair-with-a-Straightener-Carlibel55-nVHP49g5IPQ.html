just like I stand before you a
to watch you leave and all the time I'll
let you in
just feel
I disappear when you
hi everyone thank you for watching so
today I'm going to be showing you how to
curl your hair with a straightener it's
so funny because back when I was in high
school that's the only way I really knew
how to curl my hair I didn't even know
about the wands and about wrapping your
hair I didn't even know there's like ten
different kinds of curls that you can do
so I know I did old Hollywood curls and
I've done big waves and all kinds of
other curling videos so this one's a
little bit different
of course it's with a straightener so
that's why the curls look like this
they're bigger they're more flowy and
they stay a lot longer this way the
straightener that I'm using is by new me
and I have the pink one and what's
really cool is for the holidays they
gave me a coupon
it's Bible for new me I'll list that
below and I think you can get a strainer
for like $49 what a night I'll double
check but I'm pretty sure it's $49 and
they come in all different colors I
actually got I'm not gonna say who but
someone in my family a green one in case
they watch it I don't want them to see
it so what I love about curling my hair
with a strainer is that it lasts for
like two days so tomorrow when I wake up
and if I brush it out it's gonna be like
nice big waves and that's such a plus so
if you want to learn how I curl my hair
with stray hair please keep watching
first you're going to want to section
off your hair and pin the top half up
then you're going to want to take a comb
hopefully yours doesn't look like what
mine looks like but you're just going to
want to brush through the hair to make
sure it's nice and smooth
taking my nume strainer I'm then going
to clamp it over my hair and I'm going
to be spinning the straightener around
like this you're going to want to pull
the end of your hair pull it around and
continue to circle the strainer and pull
it down to the bottom of your hair I
don't know if I'm really explaining that
that well but I'm going to show you a
couple times how I do it just you can
get the idea
for the front pieces the only difference
is you're going to be holding the hair
up and you're going to be spinning the
iron away from your face and that's
gonna help the curls stay away from your
face
whenever I curl my hair the strainer
it's important to use some sort of argan
oil on the ends because your hair is
going to be a little bit fried so the
argan oil really helps to smooth it out
and give it a really shiny look you're
going to want to run your fingers
through your hair and then go over any
pieces that maybe aren't as curled as
they were previously for hairspray I'm
going to be using Loreal Elnett satin
the one I always use and I'm just gonna
be spraying it all over my hair this
part is optional but if you want to
tease the back it's just gonna give it
some more volume so I hope you all
enjoyed this tutorial and you could
definitely try it out for the holidays
and remember I do have a coupon code to
get the strainer for only $49 so go
check it out have a great holiday guys
tell me this is the last time I say it's
this is the last time you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
