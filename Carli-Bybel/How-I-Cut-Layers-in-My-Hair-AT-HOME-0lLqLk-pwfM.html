today's video I'm going to show you how
I cut some layers into my hair I've been
growing out my hair for like ten years
I've talked all about my hair in
multiple videos so I won't get into all
those details but it's been a really
long time since I've cut some layers in
my hair
I would say like six months ago I
trimmed them just a little bit but I've
been trying to keep my hair all one
length so it grows really thick and
really long with the keratin treatment
that I have my hair is just super flat
and when I don't have layers in my hair
no matter what I do my hair just
flattens out like really quickly so I
knew it was time to cut some more layers
in my hair and give myself some body
back so I just wanted to take you guys
through and show you what I do it's
basically the same thing that I've been
doing for like five years now I am NOT a
professional I've never went to school
to cut my hair but I just had some
really bad experiences getting my hair
cut and now that I finally have long
hair I will never let anyone touch it
but myself some people may think that
I'm butchering my hair but this is how
it came out just exactly how I wanted it
I'll show you guys from the back so it
was all basically one length and I
wanted to cut like right in here to just
help lift it all up so I wanted to also
curl it under so you can really see the
layers and barely cut anything off of
the bottom just kind of dust it a little
bit so it's all soft and thick and
looking good so if you guys want to
learn how I cut my hair at home please
keep watching so you want to make sure
you brush out your hair and I blew out
my hair right before this video so it's
nice and straight and I like to cut my
hair dry just so I can see where
everything is gonna weigh and then what
I like to do next is sit on my hair a
little bit above my ears and this layer
I like to keep all one length and the
reason I like to do this is I like to
keep a really thick bottom layer and
then just cut the layers on the top
layer just because I like to keep it
looking really thick that way I don't
really need extension
if I don't want to my biggest problem
that I always noticed when I got my hair
cut was they started the layers way too
short so the bottom layer was just way
too thin and then it would never grow
past my shoulders so it's really
important to keep the bottom layer super
thick and all in length so your hair can
still continue to grow so I'm just
sliding down my fingers and I'm cutting
off about a half an inch and this is
just gonna really dust the ends I have a
fear of chopping off too much so a
little bit goes a long way in this case
so what I always do is I just smooth the
hair slide my finger down make sure it's
all even and then I just trim the bottom
straight across
you want to make sure both sides are
even so this one is a little bit longer
so I'm just dusting off a little bit
more on that end and that's all I'm
doing for this layer
we're gonna bring down another layer
this one's gonna be I'm gonna see like
two inches above your ear that's just a
guesstimate but I'm just taking
everything from the back drawing a
center part in the middle and bringing
all my hair to the front and I'm
repeating the same step so this layer
about two inches above my ears it's all
again gonna stay one layer I'm just
cutting it straight across and this is
just to keep a really nice thick bottom
layer so once you get the whole bottom
layer all on length we can just flip it
on back
so now we're gonna be moving on to the
top part I'm just gonna part my hair
wore and normally would pull the hair to
the front and then I'm gonna clip back
all of the bottom layer that way I don't
accidentally cut any layers into that
part so I'm just clipping that part back
and then I'm gonna work with this top
layer I'm going to start by cutting
straight across the longest layer that I
have just to kind of make it all even
cuz it looks pretty raggedy at this
point and then once I do that I'm gonna
start cutting angles in the front of my
hair and this is gonna start the process
of giving layers and when you put layers
in the back you have to angle the front
that way it all kind of blends together
nicely
so I'm just cutting off any excess and
then I'm moving on to the front part of
my hair this is like my little bang I
never have them as bangs they're not
even that short but I like to call my
bank piece so I bring it just below my
chin and then I'm gonna start cutting
all this hair off
so first I'm cutting it straight across
just because I want the longest part at
this length and then I'm gonna grab that
same piece and then start cutting up on
a diagonal so it's gonna give it a
little bit of an angle I'm now grabbing
that same section on the opposite side
with that section that I just cut and
I'm bringing it all to the front and I'm
cutting it in like in popcorns be that
way it's gonna be even and it's gonna
get both sides the same length of angles
so the next part is just grabbing pieces
of hair pulling it forward and just
going down on a slant to give it a
really pretty angled look
one thing you probably notice me doing
on this side of my head is I take the
hair and then I flip it because when
you're doing it on yourself it's kind of
hard to do this one side but if you just
pull it down smoothly and line it up
with your fingers you could see exactly
what parts you need to cut off and then
you just kind of turn it around so doing
that exact same thing just grabbing
pieces making sure all the angles line
up
my main technique is I just continuously
grab pieces and just make sure that the
bottoms are all on a nice even angle the
first time you do it it's not gonna be
perfect so just keep grabbing those same
pieces to the front and you'll see how
it's just gonna slowly give you a really
pretty angle down
okay so now that I have done the angles
in the front I'm going to section off
the crown of my head I'm going to leave
my bangs out and then with this brush
I'm just gonna create a straight line
all the way to the back of my head and
I'm just clipping back the front pieces
of my hair so again I don't cut anything
that I already cut I'm just working with
section by section so I'm taking a small
front section from the back section that
we're doing I'm smoothing it out and
then I'm taking my fingers like a
scissor and the V is gonna go straight
to the center of my head drag it up and
then I'm gonna slide it forward a little
bit and then bring it down so it's not
gonna look like I'm cutting it evenly
but it's kind of hard to explain what I
mean but if you take your hair and
between your fingers put all the way up
pull it forward a little bit and let a
little bit of hair come out then that's
how you know it's gonna be on that
straight angle so that's what I'm doing
right here and it's really hard to
explain but you guys can kind of see
what I'm doing so then I'm just taking
the rest of that hair and you guys can
split this into maybe like two or three
more sections but at this point I was
sweating and I just wanted to get it
over with and I already know what I'm
doing so I just took that hair and then
I'm gonna start going in on it and just
start chopping it so it's in a nice even
angle um this is a lot of hair to work
with at once and just so you guys know
these scissors are brand new I just
opened them for this video I got these
at Walgreens
they are haircutting scissors so they're
not kitchen scissors before some of you
guys start freaking out about that but
they are very sharp this is just the
technique that I like to do and again
just keep grabbing the pieces and making
sure that they're all blending in nicely
okay so now I'm just taking my hair out
of all the clips bringing it all to the
front and then I'm just gonna see what I
got going on fix any little stragglers
and just make sure everything's super
even so this is the final result I again
just wanted to curl my hair under so you
can really see the layers and see what I
was going for I love how it came out as
usual so some may think my technique is
crazy and I don't really have a
technique but that's fine because every
time I do it I love how it comes out and
yeah so just cut at your own risk
be careful if you're doing it for
yourself at home if this is your first
time cutting your hair at home I
recommend taking a tiny bit off at a
time as well as having someone help you
because you don't want to but your hair
and this is my disclaimer right now in
the past I've noticed that a lot of you
guys actually commented on my video
saying you thought it along with what I
did and you love how your hair came out
so I hope this video helped for those
that want to save some money and do
their hair at home and until next time
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
