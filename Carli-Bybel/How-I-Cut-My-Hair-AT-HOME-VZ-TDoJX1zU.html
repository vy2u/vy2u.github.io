been about two years I'm gonna say since
I posted my last video and how I cut my
hair at home this morning I was
blow-drying my hair and I noticed how
dead my hair is at the bottoms it's been
quite some time since I've given myself
a trim I also have not cut my layers in
a really long time because I've been
trying to grow my hair out so I wanted
to trim out my layers and trim my hair
and I guess just show you guys what I'm
doing right now if any of you guys want
to try it out at home I don't know if
you guys are anything like me but every
single time that I've gone to get my
hair cut I asked them just a trim please
take off the tiniest bit and I never
listened I always what ends up walking
out with like this much taken off so I
prefer to do my hair at home I never
went to school to learn how to cut your
hair at home and I want to school for
anything for that matter as far as hair
makeup but this is the way that I love
to do it the way that I've been doing it
for at least 3 years now so if you guys
want to see how I do it please keep
watching so I'm now in my bathroom and
whenever I cut my hair I like to close
my drain in my sink and then cut it over
the sink that way it's easier to clean
up I'm just using a towel to wrap around
myself so I don't get hair all over the
place whenever I cut my hair I like to
bring all of my hair to the front I just
blow dried my hair straight because I
like doing it straight that way it's a
lot easier to tell if it's even I
brought all my hair to the front it's
all brushed out and I'm just gonna take
all of my hair smooth it down and go all
the way to the bottom and just cut a
straight line
so again I'm smoothing down my hair
going to the bottom and again just
making sure it's cut in a nice straight
line moving on to the other side of my
hair I'm doing the same thing one thing
I can't stress enough is just to make
sure your hair is not knotted and that
it's really brushed out that way you're
going to get the closest to perfect cut
I'm saying closest the perfect because
we are doing it at home so it may not be
as perfect as a salon but you are taking
off as much as you want to take off and
you're not going to walk out with eight
inches cut off with your hair so once
I've done both sides I'm just going to
smooth them down and just make sure that
they're even
next up I'm cutting some angles in the
front of my hair so I'm grabbing my hair
from the middle part down to my ear and
I'm bringing it all forward you want to
make sure it's all brushed and all
straight forward and you're going to
start cutting your hair and a diagonal
down so with slanted scissors I'm
cutting angles right down the front of
my hair so once you're done you'll see
the top of your hair will be the
shortest part and it'll go and a nice
angle down when your hair is this pin
straight it does look a little bit rough
around the edges but I always like to
blow my hair out or have a little bit of
a curl in it so it's gonna really give
it a lot of body by adding the angles in
the front and then in a little bit I'm
going to show you how I do the shorter
layers in the back and again this is all
to just help your hair get nice and full
so with the lights and that towel I was
just getting way too hot so I'm just
gonna risk getting hair all over me for
the back part of my hair I am taking my
fingers from my middle part and I'm
going right around the crown of my head
and I'm pulling up the hair I'm then
going to section that into two pieces
and take a thin top section like this
and I'm going to be brushing it forward
again you want to make sure it's super
smooth and brushed all the way forward
and then with my two fingers I use those
as kind of like a comb I drag it all the
way down so it's straight bring it
forward and then snip off the edges
then I'm repeating the same steps just
pulling up some hair smoothing it out
using my two fingers as a comb to make
sure it's also straight and then I'm
just cutting all the rough edges
then I like to take the pieces on the
side of my head and just bring them all
forward some of it has the back layer in
it so I can just trim the hair around to
blend it in from the angles in the front
to the layers in the back it's kind of
hard to explain so I don't even know if
this makes any sense but it's just all
about trial and error just take small
pieces try and have them all blend
together once you're done with that
bring all your hair to the front and
just kind of level it out and make sure
it's all even and whatever pieces you
have to go back and cut just take them
and cut them
so this is the final result I know it's
not much of a change but as I said I
just needed a trim I just like cutting
off the dead ends every couple of months
that way my hair grows a lot longer and
a lot quicker I have been taking
different supplements to help my hair
grow but it's only been about a month so
I'm going to use them a little bit
longer just to make sure that I
officially approve them before I let you
guys know but again if this is your
first time trying this at home or you've
never done it before either ask someone
to help you or just do a tiny bit at a
time because I don't want any of you
guys coming to me complaining that your
hair got all butchered but it may seem
like a weird process on how I do it but
that's just the way that I've always
done it so I hope this video helped for
those of you out there we're just
looking to do your own hair at home and
until next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
