sorry it's been forever since I posted a
video I was away over the weekend Nicole
and Jeremy came up from Florida and we
were in Atlantic City for the weekend we
had so much fun but I'm finally back to
filming today I've seen so many requests
for this video forever now and I figured
alright I'm going to sit down and film
it today it shouldn't be too too hard so
if you guys want to see what I got going
on on my iPhone please keep watching so
this is my iPhone I have this cute
little bumper on it and it has the her
meds symbol it's so cute it's like black
and gold so this is my main home screen
it's kind of busy I have obviously the
normal messages camera calendar YouTube
photos Twitter and of course on my front
page I have candy crush it's like a sick
addiction every single night before I go
to bed obviously playing it I'm on level
315 crazy this one's hard
this one they want you to collect the
cherries and these fall and then they
get stuck so somehow you have to move
these over to and it's just impossible
I've been on this level for like a
couple days now but yeah it's like a big
problem I'm always playing it and it's
so funny because if I have this thing
turned on then you can hear the sound so
I'll like try to sneak that I'm playing
it so but about things I'm an addict
and all of a sudden you hear alright so
I think you all understand the whole
candy crush thing but that's right on my
front page because it's something I'm
always using then I have the weather app
my Facebook app in my navigation I have
the maps that comes with the iPhone also
in navigation I have this new app called
ways that open and this is cool because
it shows you where there's traffic and
it also shows you I guess other users um
let's see what are you doing over here
what are you doing a little pink guy
with a knife so it shows you other
people that are in traffic or whatever
is going on so that's pretty cool
and the last app that I have under there
is uber which I'm sure you guys have
heard about uber it's like an easier
taxi service then I have my Starbucks
app which I always pay with the
Starbucks app which is pretty cool the
clock app store settings Instagram in my
planner I have the reminders the
calculator and notepad and then dollar
signs I have my paypal chase American
Express n PNC all in this little grouped
area right here though and then on the
second page all the apps that I never
use are right here um the ones that I
guess you can't really delete off of
your phone then I have for music the
nothing my Pandora is down here so
Pandora is what I always listen to my
favorite stations are Lady Antebellum
Coldplay Rascal Flatts ah
ambient ambient however you pronounce it
is a sick app if you guys have trouble
sleeping it's going to help you fall
asleep I have some really soothing music
here I'll play it for you
it's just like something you would hear
in a spa it's just very relaxing um
Rascal Flatts Coldplay Lady Antebellum
those are all the ones that I listen to
there's a few others in here I don't
even know why they're in here where they
came from southern hip hop was what we
were listening to when Nicole and Jeremy
were here I love listening to my music
on Pandora I have some music downloaded
into my music in here mostly just some
country music all that good stuff
oh also I have my mail app in here
because it's just stopped working every
time I open it let's see if it'll do it
I know it's not going to do it but
whenever I open this app it would just
cancel right out so I had to download
the Gmail app down here and swap it out
I don't know why that happened but next
I have my photography section which I'm
sure a lot of you guys have been wanting
to see my favorite editing apps are
camera plus perfect photo filter storm
and face tune so I guess I'll show you
guys how I edit my pic real quick pic
real quick so what I would normally do
is open up camera plus import a photo
let's go for this one so this is what it
would normally look like so usually I'll
hit like auto makes it a little bit
right I'll go into the filters they have
all kinds of crazy filters normally for
a normal picture I'll use overlay
because it gives you a nice below you
can change it however much you want it
so I'll just usually go to like 15
save it and then what I like to do is
I'll go into perfect photo this is my
secret technique so what I do is I'll
pick take the photo and when you take a
photo it is has a lot of noise it's
called it makes it look blurry so if you
D noise it watch it happens so like it
zooms in and you can see it just kind of
blurs out your skin I don't ever use
that much I usually go to like forty
fifty hit okay it's cool cuz it tells
you some fun facts while you're
denoising your photo but this is really
good because I always use the front
camera I mean I started switching back
to the normal camera but when you use
the front camera it's so noisy and by
noisy it means just like blurry and like
speckly looking so this is gonna really
smooth everything out then I'll just go
right into the sharpen and lower it a
little bit
save it yeah I go through like 20 apps
it's just easier and then I open up face
tune sometimes I won't use this but it's
good for blurring out some extra lines
so you go to the blur the smooth just
kind of smooth smooth some stuff and
then save it and before Instagram had
the option to edit your photos I would
then go into filter storm to kind of
color correct it a bit but now that
Instagram has its own editing it's just
a lot easier so I'll go like that go
into this thing and then usually I'll go
to the warmth make a little warmer
sharpen it up a bit and voila I'm all
ready to post it so yeah that's how I
added my pictures it's kind of annoying
you gotta keep opening up different apps
but each app does something different um
filter storm has the denoise feature but
it doesn't work as good the perfect
photo just really kind of just blurs out
the fuzziness and then you resharpen it
to make it look more natural so that is
how I do that I have pic jointer and
pick stitch to make double photos a lot
of you guys were asking how I would do
the one where I would add like two so I
say I was using that same picture put it
in and you could take away the border
and then we double tap and in here you
can get um orientation and then you just
flip it so like those are how I do the
flipped ones and you can just see it's
cool
something like that not that I would
post a selfie like that but I like to do
a more full-body luck with that
um pic Joyner I don't really use as much
anymore
I only use it if I want to make a
YouTube thumbnail you can see they have
the different sizes the one by one is
obviously for Instagram but three by two
is like a perfect size for your YouTube
picture so you can make the border
thinner and then you can just add your
picture in like that um what else do I
have on here that I haven't showed you
okay turbo collage is just random
collages that you can mix and match a
bunch of pictures so you can just select
as many pictures as you want and then
they will all just show up you can pick
like how you want it send our frame pile
you can just kind of move them all
around so that one's kind of cool I
don't really use this one much but um I
forgot to show you bokeh file which is I
used to use this all the time you just
pick what shape you want and then it
gives you Goga like that sorry my phone
died but back to the second page I have
this app called lens light and this is
just to add some flares or some light to
your photo so let's grab a photo you can
click whatever effect and then there's
all kinds of effects but you can resize
it just by going like that so some
people I've seen put them like on their
earrings give it a little glow something
like that but I haven't used this one in
a while but I still have it on my phone
just in case this section I have some
important apps I have my Find My iPhone
app which is literally everything
everyone if you have an iPhone please
get it because it has saved me and Brett
so many times if you have your location
services on and you lose your iPhone you
open this up and it'll tell you exactly
where your iPhone is you can play a
noise so it's easier to find so yea this
app is literally everything then I have
my ADT app which unlocks my front door
locks the front door puts the alarm on
right from my phone
one so if I forget to do it before I
leave the house or anything like that I
could just do it right on my phone which
is so convenient then I have this app
which is my period tracker which i think
is cool I've had this forever and it
just lets you know when you get your
period so you can track it and 14 days
left yeah so it's just a cool app just
so you always know when you're getting
it the next app that I have in here I
just download this weekend Nicole told
me about it and it's so cool it's called
open table and you can just make a
reservation for however many people
write on an app on your phone which is
really cool then I have the wisdom app
which is the relax and sleep well app
that I told you guys about
it's a Glen and he does some meditation
this one is I believe the free version
it looks like this it says relax and
sleep well this one I paid for and it
has a bunch of different meditation to
listen to before you go to bed try it
out it's so fun you wake up feeling so
refreshed and something about this app I
love it then I have my iBooks which the
only book that I have in here right now
is the untethered soul which I actually
just started rereading please read this
book if you haven't yet I know I
recommended it a bunch of times but it's
so good and it's life-changing then I
have the newsstand app whoops that just
comes with it
snip snap app which is going to give you
coupons any coupons that are active you
can just type it in at the top and let's
say I'll show you for example so yeah
20% off all you do is click it and hits
that I guess oh yeah and it gives you
the barcode and everything so you if
you're in the store you can just bring
this in like they could skin it right
off your phone so this app is awesome
for anyone who loves a good discount and
the last app that I have in here is
called gifts and this is so cool because
if you get a lot of gift cards you can
track them all right in here so for
instance for around the holidays I got a
Cheesecake Factory Wawa Starbucks Pier
one you can add in any gift cards that
you have and it's just an easier way to
keep track of all of them also so your
wallet doesn't have 900 gift cards in it
so this I thought was super cool you
just click it and then you click redeem
and then there's a scannable code right
there and
the last section I just have my games
other than candy crush these are the
games that I like to play temple Rana
this was literally me and Brett's
addiction for a while hey William
showing them my games this game is so
old skin is so good though like I'm so
late with the new game I don't play any
other games so he's calling your cousin
shirt that's it we go to 15 oh man other
game that I still have on my phone is
flappy bird I think my high score was
like 13 don't mess up okay thanks thank
you for me
oh no my high-score was 48 do you see
that that's just ridiculous and with
this game it literally gives you anxiety
the next one is dumb ways to die this
one is deaf my favorite looks cute
little baby
humph that our little Dean oh man oh man
what the heck
ah what there's a flappy bird game and
it's called flying Fred it's a bird his
name is Fred it's weird
maybe it's my baby reincarnated shake
shake that sucka Oh get the game it's
fun and then I have snapchat which I
never even use but yeah that is it as
far as my apps
my background is me and bupps it's been
this one for a while but what I used to
do is I always would put a quote on the
background that way whenever I would
screenshot something or just shut my
phone it'd be a nice quote to look at so
that is it as far as what's on my iPhone
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
until next time see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
