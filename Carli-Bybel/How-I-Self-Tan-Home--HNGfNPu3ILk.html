everyone thank you for watching so not
too far back I posted a video mentioning
my current favorites and I told you guys
about my favorite self-tanner at the
moment and I know a lot of you guys have
been requesting a self-tanner demo so I
wanted to show you guys how I personally
apply my self tanner I usually do it if
not every two weeks usually every three
weeks because it does last about a week
and it gradually comes off so once I
start noticing myself getting really
pale like I am right now
I will reapply it before I showed you
guys the demo I just really quickly
wanted to go over a couple of the other
products that I've used why I didn't
like them so I did go through YouTube
but I did look for the most popular
self-tanner so to say and I did cover up
the brands because you guys watched my
extension video I am doing the same
thing I don't want to bash any names
because every product works differently
for other people so really quickly I'm
just gonna show you what I'm talking
about with the other products the first
two that I'm not going to talk about
because I covered up the brands but one
of them I was actually really excited
about because it was recommended by like
the Allure Beauty magazine so I thought
it's gonna be really good and remember
everyone has different skin tones so
some Tanner's that look bad on me may
look better for some people but what I
notice about these two is they came out
like a greenish Brown they weren't like
a nice just came off the islands suntan
look it was like a greenish like I don't
really even know how to explain I'm
going to show you so this is the first
one and then this so you can see they're
very very dark instantly right on your
hand and when you rub them in you'll see
like where it's going and I'll give you
a guess a bit of an instant tan but it
has like a very greenish not like a nice
Brown to it when I did it I only did
half of my body just to kind of tell
sit out and I was really not happy with
it so I did shower off most of it right
away last thing you want is to be a
gross color for a week and be stained
and these ones they do like stain your
skin don't apply it evenly or if you
apply extra on certain spots it's going
to be really blotchy so that's one thing
I did not like about those two the third
one I tried I heard some good things
about it and I wanted to try it out but
it gave me like an orangey tan and that
was my biggest fear of selfie heading
like ever before I ever self-tan I was
like oh my gosh I'm afraid I'm weak
orange like I don't want to be orange at
all and this gave me an orange though so
these ones are all dark lotions when you
put them on and it's all gonna give you
the same problem if you rub it in and
it's not even it's gonna get blotchy and
it's just going to give random marks and
yeah this one just gave me like a more
of an orange II glow so I wasn't happy
with this one either
so the fourth self-tanner that I finally
got around to which I did mention again
was the million dollar tan and the
reason I instantly love this was because
it came out clear and when you rub it in
it's white so it's like a regular lotion
as if you're applying on regular lotion
so it's a lot easier to see where you're
rubbing it into because again it is
white so it's not like cloudy with the
brown stuff so you can't really see
where it's going and the reason I also
like this is because it is buildable so
if you just want a little bit of a tan
you can just apply it like a normal body
lotion but if you wanted a deeper tan
you can apply it so it's like it makes
your whole arm white and you just gotta
like sit there and rub it in rub it and
rub it in and what's good is it also
doesn't stain your hands because this
self-tanner does take about four to six
hours to actually fully come out it's
good because you can fully apply it to
your body and then wash your hands after
and not have to worry about having green
orange black hands what's really awesome
about the million dollar can is when you
apply it you don't have to worry about
cleaning your sheets or ruining your
sheets because since it is a clear /
white cream it does take about six to
eight hours to fully develop into the
right color so if you apply it before
bed you can wake up and you'll be super
tan with the other lotions they're going
to be brown and like stain so if you
do decide to lay on your sheets it is
gonna sing your sheets which is going to
be just a hassle again this is going to
be in my opinion the nicest brownest
natural to the Sun sunless tan I want to
show you guys a quick demo showing how I
do it and yeah it's basically really
really simple and I hope you guys
enjoyed this video hope it helped I'm
sorry I'm not going to mention the names
of the other companies just because
again my opinion and someone else's
opinion can be completely different
everyone has different skin tones so
just in my own personal opinion I did
try out four different ones and this one
was my overall favorite I hope this
helped me be clear it up for a couple of
you guys who were in the market for the
self-tanner and I hope you guys enjoy
I'll see you soon you're gonna do is
you're gonna apply one the two pumps per
area I would say and it what's cool is
as you could see just white and clear so
you're applying it as if you were
applying your own body lotion as if
you're going to get a shower and the
reason I like it like this is because
you can rub it all in to make sure it's
perfectly even unlike the staining ones
that is once it's on your skin it's
going to be stained you can see it's
like a white it's like any other normal
body lotion it's really really like
conditioning so it feels like you are
actually putting on lotion which is nice
so I just finished rubbing in all the
lotion so I'm going to come back in a
couple hours just to show you guys the
finished result so look how pasty I am
and I'll see you guys soon
it's now been a few hours and my tan is
starting to develop and I'm starting to
look tan again yay so now that you guys
know my tanning secret I hope you guys
go out and try it because remember the
real Sun will eventually give you
wrinkles which nobody wants so a nice
self-tanner is always an amazing thing
to have Millie now Chan 100% of the way
and I hope you guys enjoyed this video
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
