you guys have been following me on
social media the past few weeks you may
have seen that I have a new eyelash
coming out with velour lashes I helped
design the lash and I took a little bit
of my favorites from each lash and
combined it into the carpet lash so I'm
actually wearing them right now and I'm
so obsessed with them and I'm so excited
to be announcing it for you guys it goes
on sale today for presale and
unfortunately they won't be shipped in
time for Christmas but they will be to
you guys before New Year's if you do
decide to buy them today you guys have
probably seen me use velour lashes a ton
in my videos they are definitely my
number one brand so when they came to me
asking if I wanted to create my own lash
I was literally jumping up and down and
I was like this is so cool I don't
really have anything that's mine yet so
I thought it would be a great way to
start so I'm going to take you guys
through all the steps on how to take
care of the lashes how to apply them all
that good stuff so stay tuned for that
I'll be showing that in a little bit
before I get into that though I just
wanted to go over the lash and tell you
guys a little bit more about it that way
if you have any questions hopefully I
can get them all answered before we get
going so for the Carlie lash it is on
sale for $35 I know some of you guys
would be like what $35 well first of all
I have a 15% off code so with the code
it comes to about 30 dollars the reason
that these lashes are a bit more
expensive which if you go on the website
every lash is between thirty and fifty
dollars is because they are made from
main-care and they are not disposable
you can get about 25 uses of them if you
take care of them the right way and they
are amazing quality they look so natural
and I love them because you can really
glam them up or you can even do a subtle
makeup look like what I have on now and
they look really awesome as well so I
wanted to talk about the whole mink hair
situation because when I posted my
first Instagram post about this I saw a
couple people getting really angry with
me and I just wanted to clear this up
before anything so I wanted to let you
guys know about the mink hair where it
comes from how its cruelty free and all
of that just before I get into anything
else I'm literally going to read what
they have on their website their cruelty
free and sterilized they're 100% natural
mink hair and it is free from any
chemical processing or dyes velour mink
is collected from free-range Jews and
recycled during the shedding season
it's then sterilized to ensure it's
completely safe for use so if you want
to learn a little bit more about that as
well if you have some more questions go
right on their website and they have a
whole section where they explain
everything to you for those of you guys
who may have some more questions so no
animals are harmed whatsoever it's just
through the natural shedding process so
I just want to clear that up before I
move any further another reason that
these lashes are a bit more expensive is
that they are all individually made so
if you never tried a pair of velour
lashes if you were to compare them to
say a drugstore brand you can see the
huge difference in them there's about
double the amount of hair on it they're
thicker lashes they look so natural I've
been wearing these a ton lately and
every time I wear them people are like
are those your real lashes and I'm like
I'm always tempted to be like yeah
they're mine they're my real lashes but
then I don't I can't lie I'm just
literally the worst liar so I am
obsessed with them I'm so excited to be
announcing it for you guys they are
finally on presale today so head over to
the website check it out read up a
little bit more about them if you want
and stay tuned because I'm going to show
you guys how to take care of the lashes
as well as how to apply them properly
because sometimes the lashes are a
little bit too long so you need to cut
them measure them to your eye and yeah
there's a whole long process so I'm so
excited thank you guys so much because
without any of you guys this opportunity
wouldn't have even been possible I
really back these lashes up 100% I think
they're beautiful I think they're
natural they're wispy they're just
amazing and I think they would look
great on everybody one last thing and
then I will stop blabbing I prom
if you guys decide to go out and try
this lash please hashtag me I'll include
the hashtags that I'll be looking at so
I can repost them because I want to
shout all of you guys out on my
Instagram I want to see all of you guys
wearing them and see how beautiful they
look on all of you so if you guys want
to learn how to take care of these bad
boys and get 25 uses ahead of them
please keep watching the first thing you
always want to do is measure the lashes
with your eyes because one thing with
Flora lashes is they make them a little
bit longer that way if you have larger
eyes they'll be perfect but if your eyes
are a little bit smaller I recommend
cutting them they are a little bit too
long for my eyes so I'm just going to be
trimming off you'll see on them there's
like a little bit of black space on the
edge of each so I'm going to cut off the
two black ends and I'm also going to
start cutting them from the outer corner
the reason I want to do it from the
outer and not the inner is because the
lashes go from big to small and we want
the smallest section in the corner of
our eye so it looks more natural it
doesn't look as fake when you're taking
them out of the tray you want to be
super careful with them these lashes are
as I said previously a little bit more
pricey than most you can really see the
quality in these lashes they look so
real and they last so much longer so
again be extra careful with them because
we don't want any of the hairs coming
out what I like to do is bend the
plastic that way I'm not ruining the
lashes and it's a lot easier to get them
off so as you can see there's like two
longer black ends so I always like to
cut those first
and I just measured them again and since
they are still a little bit longer I'm
going to cut a tiny bit more off of the
end so as you can see they still look
perfect I just had to cut them to my eye
shape if your eyes are a little bit
smaller you can just continue to cut
them until they fit perfectly the next
step before you actually apply the
lashes is to apply a mascara as I said
earlier you want to do the mascara first
so you don't really get them on the
lashes then you can apply any eyelash
glue each lash does not come with glue
so make sure that you use a proper
eyelash glue you can get those really
anywhere you want to wait a few seconds
till the glue dries a little bit and
then start applying it I don't use
tweezers to apply my lashes but for some
people I know they find that easier if
you just wait long enough so the glue is
basically dry it's so much easier and it
doesn't slide all over the place what I
also like to do is pinch my eyelashes
with the false lashes to give it a more
natural look
so next I'm going to talk about cleaning
the lashes it's important that you clean
them correctly that way you can get as
many uses out of them as possible the
first thing that you always need to do
is after each use you can use a tweezer
and you start picking off the glue the
reason you want to pick off the glue
between each use is because it's going
to make it go on a lot easier for the
next time and we want to get as many
uses out of them as possible so again
with a tweezer you're going to start
very very gently picking off the glue
don't hold or pull the lashes because
they do fall out pretty easily so you
just gently pinch and then start picking
up the glue
so I'm not gonna lie I've been a little
bit naughty and when I've worn these I
haven't picked the glue off so there's
maybe like two or three uses that I
haven't picked the glue off I got these
as the sample ones about a few months
ago so they've lasted a really long time
already it's funny because if you guys
saw my be room tour you probably saw
that I have like two drawers full of
false lashes and it's so funny because
some people are like how do you have
that many lashes I mean a lot of the
companies send them to me so that's why
I have like an excessive amount but I
also like to get as many uses out of
each pair as possible like even though I
might have like five of the same pair
I'll try and use the one pair for as
many uses as I can until they're like
not usable anymore
and the reason for that is that they
just last so long so it's like why waste
a fresh pair when you can get a few more
uses out of these like I said if you're
doing this in between each use with
these I promise you it's not going to
take as long it's not going to be as
annoying so I recommend doing it in
between so it's not so built up another
thing they recommend since it is mink
hair is that you don't put mascara on
them I apply my mascara first and then
I'll apply them and not gonna lie
sometimes I have to add a little bit
more mascara to make my natural lashes
blend in with the fake ones so if you
got a little mascara on them it's not
the end of the world don't worry just
don't put an excessive amount I like to
take a q-tip with some oil-free makeup
remover and I just like to comb over the
areas that there's mascara on them but
what you could do is if you do it right
on the tissue you can already see the
tissues turning black from the rest of
the mascara another great thing about
these lashes is that they don't lose
their shape so they're gonna be
perfectly curled and looking nice and
new for a really long time so here you
can see I picked it up and now they look
basically brand new so the one on the
left has gotten about eight to ten uses
out of it and this is the brand new one
so you can see it really doesn't look
any different as long as you take care
of them you can get a lot of uses out of
them so again this is the one that I had
used about eight to ten
is already and then this is the
brand-new one that I haven't even used
yet so this is the final result as you
can see they are super natural looking
they're nothing crazy I will link to
videos where I actually wore these
lashes with a bit more of a dramatic
look but I wanted to keep my makeup
pretty neutral basically my go-to look
for this look so you can really see the
lashes and see that they're not anything
crazy but they're like a step up from an
everyday look because again they are a
bit pricey and I wanted to make sure
you're going to get your money's worth
but they're absolutely gorgeous and
they're my new favorites and I'm so
excited so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you decide to go out and
purchase them again please hashtag me
because I want to see you guys wearing
them and I want to repost them and just
share the love so I love you guys so
much and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
