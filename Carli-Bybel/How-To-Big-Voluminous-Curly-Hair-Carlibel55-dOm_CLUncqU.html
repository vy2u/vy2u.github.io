anyway
she wears a heart that Kamel my own
she wears a smile that wanna sing hi
everyone thank you for watching so today
I'm gonna be showing you how I got my
hair like this I posted a picture a few
days back when I had first tried out
this hairstyle and a lot of you love the
look so today when I asked what you
wanted to see first this is the look
that one so I hope you all enjoy this
video and this look is definitely
perfect if you are going out or doing
something fun for Valentine's Day it's
really fluffy and fun and I really loved
how it came out so if you all want to
learn how I got it please keep watching
and I hope you will have the most
amazing Valentine's Day ever talk to you
soon guys so to achieve this look I'm
going to be using the smallest size wand
from the new me Karl gem set and I got
mine in the purple zebra what's really
cool as it does come with the three size
one so you can try out all of my looks
all in one purchase before this tutorial
I already clipped in my 22 inch Bellamy
hair extensions so if you do want to
learn how I did put them in I do have a
video that I'll link up there for you
guys and also for both the new me and
the hair extensions I do have
Valentine's Day coupons so I'm going to
put those below in the description box
if anyone is interested I'm just parting
my hair where I normally would and I
already did this but you just drag your
finger back and then pull the hair all
the way to the front so all your hair is
in front then I'm just going to be
clipping half of my hair up and I'm
going to start with the bottom half
so I'm gonna take a section of hair
about this big and I'm going to take my
wand and I'm going to start wrapping
away from my face because these curls
are a lot smaller not just a little bit
less time than you normally would
because I don't want my curls to be like
completely spiraled I want them to open
up a little bit so I'm just going to
hold them in place and you'll feel
they're really hot at first you just
want to like kind of hold it until it
cools down a little bit and in other
videos I showed that you can bobby pin
the curls in place so they will say if
you do want smaller curls and you want
to cheat that look you can pin them but
for this look I'm just going to hold it
and then let it go because again I don't
want them to too small so I'm just going
to repeat the same step on the center
hair until I'm finished with this hair
and then I'm going to do the same thing
on the other side
once you finish the first side you can
take a little hairspray and I ran out of
my when I usually use so this one is by
Rusk and it's called weightless
hairspray plus and I'm going to be
spraying a little bit on my hair and
just kind of scrunching it upwards and
one thing I'll always do when I'm
finished with a section is I'll take
smaller pieces and I'll just kind of go
back over them with the curling iron and
that's just going to add more body to
your hair and also just going to add
some extra curls and give a prettier
fuller look
now I'm just using the back part of my
hair unfortunately I cut this out when I
was filming just using a comb and I'm
teasing it as I normally would in the
back section of my hair
she gives me presents
with the presence along
she gives me everything I could wish for
she is my kisses on the lips just for
coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
