Sunday
first he's turning
I swear sleeping
hi everyone thank you for watching so I
know it's been a while probably almost a
year and a half I'm gonna say since I
posted a blow-drying routine and it did
change a little bit and I do use some
different products but I just wanted to
really quickly show you guys my
different techniques that I do when I
blow my hair because my hair is frizzy
curly gross and it does take a while to
get it from that to this so if you guys
want to learn some of my techniques
please keep watching and I hope you guys
enjoy this video also in this video I am
not wearing any extensions this is my
natural hair it's finally getting a
little bit longer but not quite there
yet
to start this lipgloss I'm using the
Fekkai glossing cream and I'm just going
to be applying a little bit about the
size of a dime fall throughout my hair
and I'm focusing on the ends to protect
my hair from the heat I'm going to be
using by Chashma if they heat protectant
spray and you can find all these
products in your drugstore I also have
used the chi spray before for he
protected and I love that just as well
when blow-drying my hair I'd always
section it off I always tie the top up
first leaving the bottom half down and
then what I will do is I will run my
finger right through the back of my hair
pulling both sides to the front
on this hairdryer there are a couple
settings I'm making it the hottest and
I'm also using it on the highest power
and I'm going to start with this
medium-sized brown brush and I'm gonna
start brushing my hair up and away from
my face the first couple times that I
use the brush along my hair it's mostly
to just dry the hair so this part is not
as important as getting it silky
straight but one thing I'll always do is
I will make sure every single part of
the hair is dry I'll do the top I'll do
the bottom and I'll do the sides because
if your hair is not fully dry that is
the first step in why it would start
frizzing because once your hair is not
all the way dry it may look dry but it
still has moisture in it and once you
walk outside it's gonna be a nice big
round ball I like using the ceramic
brushes when I blow-dry my hair because
they grasp the hair a lot easier so as
you're spinning it around and going
through your hair it's gonna have a nice
grip on it and it's not gonna fall right
out or it's not gonna get um knotted
like some of the other brushes that I
have tried
you
once I'm sure that my hair is dry I will
take my hair and wrap it back up in the
brush and I'm gonna be switching on the
setting on my hair dryer to the cold
setting and I'm just going to blow some
cold air and that's gonna help set your
hair and it's give it a nice silky
finish
you
when you're drying your hair just focus
on small sections at a time and again
make sure that the hair is completely
dry because that is the biggest problem
that I've noticed for myself and also
when people have asked me your hair
sometimes looks completely dry but it
really isn't so you just want to focus
on one piece over and over again until
you're absolutely sure it's dry
every single time I blow-dry my hair is
sectioned off in three pieces so now I'm
down to the middle piece I'm just going
to section off the top piece and tie it
up and I'm going to focus on the front
part of my hair for this part next I'm
taking the smaller ceramic brush and the
difference with this brush is it's gonna
help grasp the little pieces in front of
your hair and since I do have those
little pieces what I notice work best
for me was to take the hair and drag it
towards the face but then blow it away
from the face every time I have gotten
my hair done by a professional they
always set this opposite which would
leave my hair looking 'disformed
and kind of like a bowl on top if that
makes any sense
so now for the top section I'm going to
again section it into two more pieces
and I'm going to do the back part first
and then I'm going to go ahead and do
the front piece
for these top pieces since I do have
shorter layers I always blow the hair up
in the way I never blow it back towards
the root I always do it kind of in the
opposite way that way when you do put it
back it's going to give it a little bit
more lift in the root
once I finish I always add a little bit
of argan oil into the ends of my hair
and I love this and if there's any
exercise of just what being on my skin
because it's so amazing so that is how I
blow-dry my hair it takes me about 40
minutes to do which is just so fun I
usually do it every two to three days my
hair is pretty lucky because it doesn't
get greasy that quickly so I can leave
it for a couple days
it does take forever and I am like
dyeing sweat after I finish but that's
how I get it from a big afro to nice and
silky straight so I hope you guys maybe
learned a different technique or learn
something new and if you've never been
able to do it before I hope this helped
I hope you go out and try it thank you
for watching guys I'll see you in the
oceans
California's on
the Santos is tired
we always sumif you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
