will be showing you how to clean your
brushes with dawn antibacterial soap and
I kind of bought this one because there
are penguins on it and I'm really really
obsessed with penguins but anyone with
antibacterial is definitely important
because this is going to help clean your
brushes
you're also going to be using olive oil
to clean your brushes
you're first going to be squirting some
of the antibacterial soap into the dish
and equal amounts with the olive oil
take your brush and you're just going to
swirl it so both the soap and the oil
come together just rub it around in your
hand until the whole brush is covered
it's really important to clean your
brushes because in these brushes
there's old makeup there's dirt and
debris there's bacteria there's oils and
dead skin cells think about it you're
using it on your face every day so if
you have any oils on your face to begin
with it's just you're adding foundation
plus all the oils onto your face already
which forms pimples it's really
important to do this at least once a
week
you're then going to take the brush and
swirl it in your hand underneath the
water until all of the soap comes out of
the makeup brush it's important to clean
your foundation brushes at least once a
week one of the best things that you can
do for brushes is clean them regularly
when it comes to the brushes for
finishing powders or even bronzers you
can also do that once a week for
eyeshadow brushes I would do this every
two to three days because your eyes are
very sensitive and for your eyeliner
brushes if they're ever use
when you're washing our brushes you want
to make sure you're shaping them in the
correct way because you don't want them
to be all messy looking
you know like it's the fetishes on if I
have like hand fetishes you ever get me
all over this for in between uses I use
daily cosmetic brush cleaner this is
just an easy like spray to get the
eyeshadow off in between thank you for
watching I hope that this helps have a
great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
