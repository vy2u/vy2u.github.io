couple days ago I had posted that
drugstore haul and I had used some of
the products to do my contour and
highlight routine I saw a bunch of you
guys requesting how I did the routine
with the drugstore product so I figured
why not just film it for you guys I do
leave for Texas tomorrow so if you could
see the clothes all over my floor I
apologize I'm in the middle of packing
and the way I usually pack is I'll pre
plan all my outfits with the jewelry and
everything in that way I'll set them up
on my floor and then that way I don't
over pack and bring too much stuff even
though I always end up bringing too much
stuff anyway I hope you guys enjoy this
video and if you want to learn how to
contour and highlight your face using
only drugstore products from my haul
please keep watching for foundation I'm
using the stay matte foundation by
Rimmel I'm just applying this all over
my face with my Sigma foundation brush
to contour my face I'm using this darker
color by covergirl I'm going to be
making lines where ever I want to
contour and then later on I'm going to
be taking a bigger brush to buff it all
in
once I buffed in all the lines I'm just
going back to my foundation brush and
I'm just blending it all in
in play something lighter covergirl
stick I'm using this Revlon concealer
that I actually forgot to put in my haul
it is new and I'm just applying this
wherever I want to highlight my face
which is under my eyes on the bridge of
my nose in between my eyebrows and on my
chin I know it looks like a ton of
concealer but we're going to be blending
this all in with that same foundation
brush and that is the key to each step
of this look to continue using this
brush to smooth it all out to make sure
it doesn't look cakey or anything like
that then to top it off I'm using some
setting powder also by Rimmel and this
is just to set the concealer and the
foundation
for bronzer I'm using this one by NYC
and I'm applying this all over my
cheekbones on the sides of my forehead
and I'm just basically going over the
whole contour that I had done with the
cream concealer
you
Oh
clock ticks til it breaks your glass
Randall drew
daizen frozen waves where the past comes
back to life fight fear for the selfish
pain it was worth it every time hold
still right before we crash cause we
both know how this is
and so this is the final result I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and remember
to stay tuned for part two which is
going to be a day to night makeup look I
love you guys so much and I will be in
Texas until Monday so I'm not sure if
I'll be able to film but I will be
trying to do a fashion post well in
there so have a great weekend and I will
see you guys later
still fired and I don't know
i-if
is tragedy why are you my remedy if
insanity why are you my clarity
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
