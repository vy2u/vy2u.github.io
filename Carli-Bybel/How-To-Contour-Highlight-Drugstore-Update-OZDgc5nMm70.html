today's video I'm going to teach you how
I got this full face highlighting
contour routine using only drugstore
products some of the products have been
my favorite for quite some time now and
others I just tried out just for the
first time today so I'm actually so
pleasantly surprised with how it turned
out I think it's really really natural
and it's perfect for those of you guys
on a budget that still want to get that
really nice flawless face so I also
wanted to quickly mention that my
earrings are from ludora boutique and
for the next day or two I think it's for
the next two days I'll write it all in
the description box but the 10% off code
that I normally have is now in 30% off
code so if any of you guys have been a
little hesitant on purchasing some
things for a better code I would
recommend going over to the site now and
checking out some of their beautiful
earrings because they are so beautiful
and again I have a 30% off code so I
will list all those details in the
description box for those of you guys
interested and if you guys want to see
how I got this a full face look please
keep watching so first I'm going to be
priming with my hard candy sheer envy
primer this one is specializing in
minimizing lines and pores so it's going
to give you that blurred effect this one
I picked up from Walmart so I'm just
going to put a little bit on my fingers
and rub it all over my face when you're
highlighting and contouring a primer is
very important because you're going to
be adding a lot of product and you don't
want it moving around wanted to stay all
day long next I'm using this nyx
concealer and this is the full coverage
concealer it's a bright orange shade
some of you guys may be like well what
the heck do you need that for but I
don't think I've really ever shown you
guys how to color correct in a highlight
and contour tutorial it's something that
I started doing more recently because I
noticed after a few hours these dark
circles would just come out
matter how much concealer I used so I'm
just applying a little bit on my brush
and you're gonna apply this underneath
your eyes if you have those dark circles
obviously some people are blessed and
don't have dark circles mine aren't too
too bad but this is just a step I wanted
to show you guys because I did notice
that after a few hours instead of having
my dark circles come back out when I do
the orange first it helps keep them
concealed
it's gonna look really weird at first
obviously but we're going to be covering
that up anyway
if you get dark spots like around your
mouth or really anywhere basically like
the purpley blue colors feel free to
apply that because we're going to be
covering it with foundation for
foundation I'm using the Loreal magic
nude liquid powder foundation make sure
you're shaking it really well before you
apply it I'm using this in the shade 320
which it's looking like it might be a
little too dark for me but we shall see
extra pale so a little color never hurt
nobody so you can see the orange just
kind of disappears once you put your
foundation on
I like this foundation because it's not
too thick it's pretty thin it gives you
appetite medium coverage if you guys are
looking for more of a full coverage um
which one the L'Oreal True Match I
believe it's a too much I think has a
little bit of a fuller coverage but I'm
just applying this all down because I'm
wearing a lower shirt and my skin is a
little paler so I'm just making sure it
all blends for concealer I'm using the
dark circle eraser and the color light
and you're going to apply this under
your eye and down a little bit like to
here I'm gonna do the same thing on the
other side also on my chin and between
my brows and down the bridge of my nose
if you want a little bit of extra
highlight this part is optional but I'm
just going to do it to show you guys
this is by Maybelline as well it's the
dream Lumi highlighting concealer so I'm
just going to apply a little bit just
underneath where I would normally
highlight here so normally at this point
I'd blend this in before contouring but
just to show you guys where everything
goes I'm going to do the contour next I
haven't tried this one yet I just went
to the drugstore picked it up it's by
Revlon and the color riche ginger so I
figured it'd be easier to use the stick
but we'll see how I like it but you're
going to apply this on your cheeks
and you don't want to just apply wines
wherever you want to actually go along
your contour zone so you want to suck in
your cheeks a little bit and see where
that line is that's where you're going
to apply it most going to apply it
around my forehead and also under here
and then to contour my nose want to use
the same shade but I'm going to just use
a brush to make it a little bit thinner
as you guys can see this contour color
isn't that dark you don't need to go to
too dark because the later use powder
and make it a little bit darker
ha
so it might be a little hard to see
because it's not such a dark color but
no biggie okay so I have two little
foundation brushes these are Mac 130s
and one of them is lighter one is darker
because I like to use them to blend in
the highlighting contour
so as you can see now that I've
highlighted everything I mean we still
have more steps to go with that orange
concealer that I originally applied is
nowhere to be seen so it's basically
just to prep it that way if the
concealer is fading a little bit your
dark circles aren't going to pop out and
I swear I've done it a few times and I
wasn't really sure if it did a
difference but then when I stopped doing
it I did notice that it would get a lot
darker under my eyes so this is
definitely something I recommend and I
don't think I've ever talked about it in
a video so
if you guys have a smaller forehead you
can highlight higher and do less contour
but I have a nice large forehead so I do
it just a little bit of highlight and
then the contour is going to take up
most of my forehead because that's going
to help make it look smaller so now I'm
going in with the other brush you don't
need two brushes but in between I would
recommend wiping it or at least do the
lighter part before you do the darker
part because otherwise there'd be no
point in highlighting if you're just
gonna use the dark over it
little step you today don't find me
and then to blend rhinos I'm gonna use
my finger
so now to set the highlighted areas I'm
using by Revlon
the pressed powder in what color are you
in light and this is also a new purchase
so we'll see but I'm just using this big
fluffy brush this is Sigma F 25 you're
just lightly putting this over all that
because we want to set it we don't want
it moving all over the place so that is
that so now that we've set all the
highlighted areas I'm going to go in
with my L'Oreal True Match in the color
cocoa and this one I've been using
forever and I've always been a big fan
of this I use this as a bronzer can also
use it to contour and I'm using my Sigma
F 0-5 contour brush just gonna play a
little bit on your brush and do little
circular motions over the contoured area
so I think the whole thing with contour
and highlighting is since some of these
products are in brand new and I'm just
trying them and really I can't really
tell to be honest the difference between
the drugstore or the higher-end
it's really all about technique it's
about brushes the brushes are so
important
most of my brushes are Sigma I will list
all the brushes that I did use for you
guys so I think if you invest in a
really good set of brushes that's going
to really help give you that flawless
finish that most people want so I mean
so far I'm like very happy with how it's
looking I haven't done an all drugstore
um like face routine in about a year
actually so just just a nice reminder
that you don't need to spend so much
money on all these different new makeup
products you know like some of the old
stuff does just as good as some of the
newer things so next I'm taking this Mac
129 fluffy brush and I'm just going to
add a little bit more bronzer because
I'm just feeling a little bit pale so
just so very lightly you can even go
over a little bit of the highlighted
areas just to add a little color into
your face
next for blush I'm using this one by NYX
and it's
I swear one more truck one more top
drive by NYX blush in the color wonder
lust and and right now I'm um lil aha
right now I'm loving this morphe m40 to
brush for blush I've also never used
this blush before I've tried it in other
shades so we'll see how it comes out
it's a nice peachy color
these next blushes are really good just
they're maybe not as pigmented as most
so if you just need to dip it in a few
extra times go right ahead but I like
this because it has a nice little shine
to it throw these baked they're baked
blushes so I have like a nice little
highlight built in
and one of my all-time favorite
highlighters from the drugstore is the
Maybelline master glaze and the color
subtle bronze and these are unreal like
I go back on videos sometimes and I'm
like okay how do I how did I do that
make a book because I forget sometimes
and this highlighter is just incredible
it's one of my favorites should have
included it in my yearly favorites but I
forgot like a bunch of things so you
just apply a little bit on your fingers
and you can just dab it um
I like to highlight just right above my
cheek
good see it gives it a really pretty
look
if you want you can apply a little bit
to the bridge of your nose and your
Cupid's bow so for those of you guys
like me that have some little wrinkles
under your eyes
you matter what I do I've literally
tried every single product I've tried
every suggestion and I just have these
little three little wrinkles right under
my eyes I don't know if you can even see
them from here but um there's nothing I
could do to get rid of them no powder no
nothing my concealer will always crease
into them so my little technique is
applying a light shade with my pencil
brush right underneath my eyes like
always I do it and I do it a little bit
lower than I normally would and it just
covers like most of the wrinkles so you
can't even see the wrinkles so if you
guys have some under eye wrinkles just
put a very light like smudged out Laura
on the bottom lashline and it's really
going to hide it so just a little
technique that I like to do so moving on
to lips I'm using the NYX pencil and
natural and I just want to let you guys
know because I had a little bit of
chapstick on before I started this look
this is the Burt's Bees in the club
champagne my lips have been so chapped
lately so I spend a little extra money
out of chapstick because apparently the
Burt's Bees is supposed to be really
good so that's what that little shimmer
is
and then for lipstick I'm using this new
one it's called decadent peach by
covergirl and this I also just picked up
today so let's see how it looks since
it's a little sheer than expected I'm
going to go over that with wet and wild
902 C and last but not least since I
completely forgot let me add a little
bronzer to my neck and chest so it
matches one thing you always want to
remember if you're wearing a low-cut
shirt or any skin is showing and you're
applying contour and highlight on your
face you need nee nee nee need to do
your neck and your chest because
otherwise it's not like you're wearing a
mask and that's like the number one rule
for makeup
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
I am so pleasantly surprised with how it
turned out and I will be using some of
these products in my everyday routine
now because I don't know I feel like
this looks so much more natural than my
usual contour and highlight maybe I just
need to start using lighter colors
because I'm used to having a nice tan
and lately I've been rocking my natural
skin tone color and I guess maybe some
of the shades I've been using have been
a little too dark so I hope you guys
enjoyed this routine I hope you learn
something new please comment below what
you guys want to see next on my channel
this week because I've been going
through all your suggestions and I want
to keep updating you guys on different
routines out of course you want to stay
so I love you so much and until next
time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
