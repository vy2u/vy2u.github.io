this is my second time around filming
this tutorial for you guys I filmed a
yesterday and I did it all myself
and when I was looking back at the
footage I feel like the angles of me
doing my hair was kind of hard to tell
what I was doing so unfortunately I
wasn't able to be film yesterday because
I had a meeting in New York City so I
literally was like a half hour late I'm
meeting because I was trying to film it
and get it right but it just didn't work
so I figured today I would be film it
and have Brett help me get some cooler
angles so I'm hoping that it turned out
a lot better than yesterday's video but
I just wanted to make sure that since I
am teaching you a hair tutorial you
could see kind of every angle of how
moving my hands because with this type
of hairstyle it's kind of all about
technique I can do these braids without
even looking in a mirror which is so
crazy because I swear I was one of those
people that had no idea how to do French
braids I didn't know how to do a
fishtail braid and I always was like how
can people do on their own hair I
thought it was a craziest thing
it wasn't until Apollo a couple years
ago I just was laying in bed and I was
just trying to figure out how to do a
fishtail braid that I got like really
really really into braids and little did
I know with a little bit of practice I
can do it on my own hair so I hope you
guys can follow along with this tutorial
pick up some new tricks and add some
cool hair cells here list of to do's so
I feel like I always do this hairstyle
when I am about to wash my hair I'm on
that day where it's like not looking
good
any other way and then I'll just do a
braid because it's just easy and it
prevents me from washing it another day
so it's a perfect lazy day hairstyle
another thing I always do when I shower
I like to shower at night I don't know
why I just never shower in the morning
it's just not my thing so every night
when I shower not every night I don't
shower every single night but when I do
wash my hair I always get out of the
shower and I do one French braid I just
love how my hair dries that way it gives
it like really pretty natural leaves so
I'm always always always doing French
straight at night if I'm a little lazy
and I don't have it in me to do the
French braid off into a regular braid
but that's my secret I think to growing
like really really long hair as I always
let it air dry I never use heat on it
anymore I used to always use a blow
dryer to dry my hair but I just kind of
found a better technique where I'll
shower at night I'll braid my hair and
then by the time I wake up my hair is
dry and it's like fringe free in perfect
little waves so I think that's like the
coolest thing I've ever done so if you
can't do two braids try to learn how to
do one and try my little technique if
you guys haven't already done it's not
like a crazy mind-blowing thing but let
me know if your hair got a little bit
better so I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and if you want to learn how I
got this hairstyle right here please
keep watching so first you're going to
want to part your hair it's all about
preference whether you want it directly
in the center we're a little bit off to
the side I always do it just like a drop
off to the side just because that's how
I prefer it but I like to part the top
first also really quickly before the
tutorials started I brushed my hair you
want to make sure your hair is brushed
and has no knots in it because if you
have any knots in it it will make it ten
times harder believe me I've tried it
both ways so once you get that part
straight you're going to want to drag it
to the back
okay so once you've parted your hair if
this is like your first time doing it
maybe ask someone it's the part is
straight in the back it's always harder
to get it straight on the back if you're
doing it on yourself but it's not you're
seeing it so it's not a big deal so next
you're just going to take a clip and
then clip whatever side you are not
doing so the first thing you want to do
is spray your hair with either a
lightweight hairspray or some water I
don't have either actually at the moment
so I'm using my facial spray actually
just to get it a little damp and to keep
it really smooth this will make it a lot
easier for you when you are braiding it
so just a little recommendation so the
first thing that I always do when I
start out my braids is I grab it a
little section of hair from the top just
about this much you just want to smooth
it out and then create three sections
like that so to do a Dutch braid what
you have to do is take each end piece
and cross it under the middle for a
regular French braid it's just over the
middle so it's really not that big of a
difference for those of you who don't
know so the first thing I'm going to do
is take this left piece put it
underneath the middle piece cross it
over and then the right piece and cross
it under the middle piece so now we're
interesting thing with this piece we're
going to grab another section of hair
small section cross it underneath the
middle piece pull it tight and then
repeat on the other side so this is this
piece we want to grab another section
put it under the middle and pull tight
and you just want to keep repeating so
we're going to pull a section put it
underneath okay
if you're playing a piece and it's not
smooth just smooth it with your little
brush they'll prevent having to use too
many bobby pins I just like to do these
braids extra tight that way I can pull
them apart later on so it just comes out
neater that way
you
once you finish that you're going to
bring the hair to the front and then
just continue the braid to secure the
bottom of your hair you're going to use
a little elastic I get these ones at the
drugstore they're better for when you're
doing two braids like this because the
braids are a lot smaller so if you're
using a regular size hair tights in the
loop they come in black and they also
come in blonde and they come and clear
so whatever color hair you have there
will be a hair tie that will match so
then I have like some shorter pieces
that stick out you just got to like tuck
them in and it'll stay now what I like
to do is I like to slowly pull apart the
braid just to widen it it makes your
hair look a lot thicker so it's like a
little trick that I like to do and if
you do it super tight at first it's
always going to look a lot better when
you pull it out this way because if you
do it looser it's just going to come out
so quickly even when I do it this tight
at the end of the day like there's so
many pieces that are just out everywhere
so I also like to pull like my little so
I burns out and then I like to push my
baby hairs down so you just pull these
out
so now for the second side we're going
to do the same thing smooth it back
we're going to start with a small
section and we're going to do the same
thing I'm going to separate it into
three sections another thing I wanted to
add is when you're doing it on your own
hair it's kind of all about how you grip
it I can do it without even looking in a
mirror because the way that you grip it
you can just feel that it's going the
right way so I take my hand that I'm
holding my hair with the opposite hand
I'm wrapping around my head and that's
what I'm going to use to hold the hair
we're going to take the first one and
put it under the middle the right on and
then put it over the middle now we're
going to grab a small piece of hair put
it under the middle small piece of hair
under the middle same thing small piece
smooth it if you gotta
you can see as we going and like rushing
through my hair even though my hair was
fully brushed it gets knotty when you're
doing this so just keep that in mind
you
Oh got my workout the day that's for
sure
so I'm going to take a couple bobby pins
and just smooth back the piece that
didn't stay as tight as I wanted it to
so you just kind of like push the bobby
pins in any museum and then I'm going to
start pulling this apart just like I did
on the other side
let's take a little bit of hairspray and
just lightly spray the front I don't
like too much hairspray so this is the
final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video hopefully learn some new
tricks let me know if you a try it out
because I would love to hear you
actually tried it out and it worked for
you and big if you've never been able to
do this before and you do learn from
this tutorial also let me know because
that makes me so happy and I feel like
it's really hard finding a technique
that works for you and sometimes people
will teach something one way and then
you'll learn how to do it completely
other way and that's how I feel like
I've always been so I hope you guys have
enjoyed I love you so much and until
next time I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
