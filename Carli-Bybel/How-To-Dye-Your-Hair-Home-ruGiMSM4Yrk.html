ton of you have always asked me what
color I dye my hair how I dye my hair
basically those two questions over and
over and over again for a long time now
so I'm sorry it's taken me this long to
get a video up but I did record myself
dyeing my hair and how it came out
I have been dyeing my own hair for about
I'm going to say seven years now I did
get it done in the salon a few times but
it never really came out how I liked it
and basically since I just do it all one
color now I like to do it at home I know
you'll probably hear constantly over and
over again don't use box size i know
it's someone who does hair it's their
worst nightmare but for me this is what
I've been using I've been happy with it
I feel like whenever I dye my hair it
gets silkier and shinier so I think
after dyeing it hundreds of times I can
honestly say that I am a big fan of box
dyes and I have used a bunch of
different box size that I have loved so
I will list below all the ones I did try
and also if you are dyeing your hair at
home put towels down everywhere and take
your time with it because it took me a
long time to really get used to it and
to not end up with dye all over my
entire face so I will post a couple tips
on how to remove dye and everything like
that on my blog so definitely check that
out and I hope you guys enjoyed this
video the colors I'm using to dye my
hair are the Garnier olia and i'm using
dark brown usually I used to mix the
medium brown with the dark brown but
this time I'm just going to do it plain
dark brown and I always need two boxes
because I have thick hair
so with the boxes it comes with
directions so each box comes with a
conditioner this is just for when you're
washing the dye out so I put these aside
and it's really simple all you do is put
on the gloves that they provide you with
and you'll see each of them are numbered
so it's pretty simple this is one and
two so you're going to apply both of
them into the little jar that it comes
with just undo the stamp so normally if
I was using two different colors like I
said if I didn't want it as dark I have
used the medium and the dark brown
together all you would do is you would
apply the number one developer which is
like a cream and first and then these
ones are the colors so this one since
they're both dark brown it's fine but
one of them says the medium brown you
would just do half of this in one jar
and then half of this color in that jar
and then in the other jar you would do
the rest of each of the two hopefully
that makes some sense but again this one
that is both dark brown so I'm just
using the one color
I like keeping the boxes handy just as
you could throw the empties right in
there
once you get that and you just tighten
it put your finger over the hole and
just shake it and again since I use two
I'm going to repeat the same steps in
the other jar alright let's get started
so whenever I down my hair I wear an old
t-shirt but I won't care if I get hair
dye on it and I have this one designated
dye your hair towel so this has stains
on it so I don't care if I get again any
stains on it before you do this make
sure you ask your parents / warn your
parents and put towels down everywhere
because the last thing that you want is
hair dyes staining your rug or anything
else okay so I've been dying my hair the
same way for I don't know six years now
seven years so this way is different
than your way or you don't agree with my
way I apologize but this is the way I've
always done it so the first thing you're
going to want to do is a make sure your
hair is not clean because it's better to
do it after a few days so they say but
you just want to make sure all the knots
are out because when you're dyeing your
hair if you have knots it could prevent
the strands from fully young died
once I finish brushing out my hair I'm
going to section it off into four
separate pieces I'm going to draw a line
from the front of my head of all the way
to the back and bring all of my hair
forward and then I'm going to continue
to tie up three different sections
you
whenever I color my hair I always like
to start with the roots before I drag
the color all throughout and I do this
because if I didn't do it this way I
noticed my roots tend to always look a
little bit lighter than the rest of my
hair so I always notice that this
technique works best for me also if you
get any hair dye on your skin don't
worry I like to just wipe it off
instantly that way it doesn't stain
because the longer you let it sit there
the longer it's going to try and see in
your skin so the plus of having a towel
wraps around you is once you get it on
your skin you can stop for a second dip
your towel on some soap and water and
then just scrub it right off so as you
can see I'm just taking the hair dye and
using it as if it was a comb and I'm
dragging it through the roots of my hair
and using my hands as well to make sure
it's all blend it in nicely and one
thing I always continuously do is use my
hands as if it were a brush to make sure
that it is reaching every single piece
of the hair on all sides of it
okay so now once I've done the whole
left side of my head right side for you
guys watching
I just comb it down like this and I just
put any extra all throughout the roots
and I do the back part of my hair as
well just to make sure everything is
covered and once that's all in I like to
just run my fingers through it as I said
previously using it as a comb
you
some people do need help doing the back
part of their hair because it is hard to
see for me I'm just good with muscle
memory I just put my head down and I
feel it out and I make sure basically
everything is covered underneath
obviously if I miss a couple strands
here there it's not the biggest deal
because again it's gonna be underneath
the hair but I make sure I use every
last drop of this hair dye to make sure
every piece of my hair is Hubbard
so once I'm positive all my roots are
completely drenched I split my hair into
two sides again and I split it into two
more sections two smaller sections that
way I can make sure it's covered
completely and I just take the hair dye
and I slide it down I'm sorry the
lighting is so bad right here I was in
my bathroom using the mirror so it was
super hard to make sure the lighting was
good but I'm just using my fingers as a
comb dragging the hair dye through
making sure again everything is
completely covered
so once I'm completely finished I always
tie it up into a bun and it kind of just
stays because of all the hair dye and I
just use whatever excess hair dye I have
and I squirt it on in the bun and then I
leave it there for 30 minutes because
that is how long you're supposed to keep
it on for so I'm going to set my timer
but before I do that I like to apply a
little hair dye on my eyebrows as well
just to make them a little bit darker I
notice it really doesn't last that long
but what I'll do is I'll apply it with a
q-tip and I'll just very gently and
lightly put it on my eyebrows and if I
happen to get it outside my eyebrows I
take a clean q-tip and just clean it off
that way
once I've waited the correct amount of
time I then just rinse out my hair and
you want to make sure you get all the
hair dye out so you're going to keep
rinsing it till the waters running
almost clear since I use two boxes I
have two conditioners one I will keep
for future use but one I'm going to use
right now and I just run it all
throughout my hair and right now there
still is some hair dye in my hair but
once you put the conditioner and you'll
see how much softer your hair gets and
it's a lot easier to get that rest that
hair dye out when it is softer so I'm
going to apply this in for a couple
minutes and then rinse it back out and
then I'm going to be deep conditioning
with the nume hydrating mask hydro punch
and I've used this for about a year and
a half now and I'm absolutely in love
with it I use a big old glob and I put
them mostly on the ends and I let that
sit for about three to five minutes and
then I rinse it out and you're all good
to go so this is how my hair turned out
I hope you guys enjoyed the video and
again I do apologize for the horrible
lighting and if you are trying this out
at home warn your mom ask your mom have
a friend do it if you're not too
coordinated with your hands and again
put towels down everywhere because you
don't want to stain anything hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I'll see you
guys soon
