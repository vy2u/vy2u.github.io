hi everyone thank you for watching so if
you guys been following me for a while
you probably already know that I love
wearing buns in my hair and a lot of you
guys have been asking for a more updated
version I know I posted one probably
over a year ago and I showed you guys
the stock bun and how to use that if you
didn't have thicker hair and you wanted
a fuller bun but I honestly don't ever
even use the sock I was more showing you
guys how to do it if you were beginners
and today I figured I would show you how
I've been doing my bun lately there's
been a few things that I've switched
around and it's half them at a time and
it gets it perfectly sleek and nice like
this and yeah it's only under five
minutes so if you're ever in a rush or
you're having a bad hair day this will
be your new favorite tutorial because
this is what I always go to so if you
ever see my hair in a bun you know that
I either woke up late and didn't have
enough time or I'm lazy and tomorrow
I'll end up washing my hair so I hope
you guys enjoy and if you want to see
how I got this whole look in under five
minutes please keep watching
Oh No so you woke up and your hair is an
absolute mess how can we do our hair in
under five minutes well I will show you
right now
I'm gonna be timing it just so you know
I'm not lying I'm going to be taking a
bottle of water to wet the front of my
hair and this is gonna help smooth it
out normally I would just use my faucet
and dip my brush in it and then just wet
it that way but to show you guys this
video it was easier to use a water
bottle
you
so once you have all that wet that's
gonna help start the sleek process I
then suggest using a smoothing brush
this one you can get at any drugstore
and it has just very fine bristles
you're gonna start this process on one
side of your head and just focus on
small areas at a time you really want to
make sure the hair is smooth back and
there's no bumps because once you put
the hair tie in if you don't smooth the
bumps then it's just gonna all pop out
and you're gonna have to redo this a
hundred times and that is definitely not
fun one thing I will always do as I'm
smoothing it out is I will continuously
pull my hair back with my hands and make
sure it's super tight and smooth back
anything I had just smooth with a brush
and that way when I go and get the other
side of my hair I don't lose any of this
hard work that I just did
I'm then gonna fasten my hair with a
hair tie
I love these ones you can get at any
drugstore they don't have any metal
clasps on them so they do get super
tight and they are good for people who
have really thick hair and want to have
it as tight as possible
once you have it in a ponytail you're
just going to take whatever hairspray of
your choice I prefer this one by L'Oreal
and I love this because as soon as you
brush it it's not going to be sticky or
hard looking it's just going to give you
a nice sleek look and once I spray it
I'm going to go back to that same
smoothing brush and just smooth in any
of the flyaways
now that we smooth it all back I'm just
going to tighten the ponytail one last
time and then I just take it all in one
hand and just kind of twist it around
just one time and as I'm doing this I
shape it as I go I grab a second hair
tie and just wrap it around my hair and
this is just gonna hold the bun in place
I'm then gonna go over to my bobby pins
to really smooth it in and tuck in any
pieces that have fallen out the key to
making your bun perfect is to really
play around with it and I always start
it off a little bit smaller and then
slowly pull out the hair from the bun
that way it's gonna be a perfect round
ball at the top of your head and it's
not gonna get lumpy and it's not gonna
look all over the place
now going to my bobby pins and any bumps
I see I'm just gonna be smoothing down
you
I do a few last sprays smoothing on back
and what do you know I've only did it in
four minutes and 30 seconds oh yeah oh
yes whew okay so I just did this whole
bun in four minutes and 34 seconds and
that was with me using a water bottle
instead of just using the sink normally
I would let the water abroad and dip my
brush under to get it wet and also wet
the top so I do recommend doing that if
you want to save a little bit of time
but for me this is always my go-to look
I know it's a very clean sleek look and
if I'm lazy as I had said previously
this is always my go-to hairstyle I feel
like no matter where you're going what
time of day it is you can always just
sleek your hair up in a nice bun and it
really pulls your whole outfit and look
together so if you've never tried out
this bun look before I dare you because
it is now summertime and I swear your
body will thank you if you put all your
hair up off your back and off your
shoulders it really really feels nice
and cool this way and also it's a mini
facelift so who even needs surgery all
you got to do is sleep it back super
tight and literally it just sucks your
face back I hope you guys enjoyed and I
will see you soon I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
