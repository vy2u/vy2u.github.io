today's video I'm going to show you how
I got these curls and I didn't use any
heat at all so it's a super healthy way
to curl your hair for those of you who
don't want any heat damage speaking of
healthy I wanted to talk about really
quick the two products that I use on my
face before I applied my makeup the
first one is the Olay fresh effects and
it's a deep cleanser and it has the
beads in it so it really exfoliates your
face really brightens up your face and
this is one of my favorites for summer
right now and then right over that I
applied also by Olay the fresh effects
soak up the sun protection moisturizer
this has SPF 15 in it so on the subject
of protecting our hair we also want to
protect our face from any sun damage
so the SPF is important I just quickly
wanted to mention that and all the
products that I use in this video can be
found at Target so if you want to learn
how to get this curly hair with no heat
damage please keep watching so to start
out this look you're going to want to
section your hair off you're going to do
the same technique as you would do if
you were curling your hair with an iron
but we're going to be using water for
this look so first you're going to take
a small section of hair about this big
and you're going to want to make sure
it's damn and using your finger as if it
were a curling iron you're going to wrap
the hair around your finger to hold the
curl in place you're going to use a
bobby pin and just stick it in you just
want to make sure it's pinned up and
staying like that you're just going to
repeat the same steps all throughout
your hair
when you're doing the right side of your
hair you're going to want to switch your
hands and point your finger down and
then just curl away from your face
once you finish each section you're just
going to use the hair spray to spray it
in place
so for the last two front pieces the
only difference is we are going to be
pinning them back instead of just
letting them hang and this is going to
help give you more body in the front of
your hair so now that all the pins are
in you're just going to want to spray
your hair one more time and you need to
let your hair dry since it is still damp
normally I recommend about a half hour
to 45 minutes so once my hair is dry I
will come back and show you the final
result as you can see their perfect
curls just want to comb them through a
little bit separate them so next I'm
going to be using by John Frieda the
frizzy serum and the reason I want to
use this is because since you are using
the water to curl your hair if you guys
have any hair like me and it gets frizzy
this will definitely help tame the frizz
it'll give it a more sleek shiny finish
as well I'm just gonna run it all
throughout your hair mainly focusing on
the ends
so now depending on how curly you want
your hair you can use their leave it as
is or you can take a brush and just
brush it through and it'll just loosen
the curls up a little bit and give it a
really nice natural look so this is the
final result it's super easy to do and I
use no heat so it's not damaging to your
hair if you guys decide to try this out
make sure to hashtag me so I can see you
recreate my looks I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and until next time
I'll see you guys later
