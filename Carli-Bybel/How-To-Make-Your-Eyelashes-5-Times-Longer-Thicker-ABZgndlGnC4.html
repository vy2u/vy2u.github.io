we're gonna stop by drinking on she
bounced why talking up
I see happen for
Smyly but we're close to teens
hi everyone thank you for watching so I
know a lot of you have been asking for
this tutorial I wanted to show you how I
put up my mascara I have been using the
same mascara for a year so if you have
been following me you do know that I
love L'Oreal telescopic and I recommend
it basically it's in every single one of
my tutorials and I know I've had a lot
of feedback and you guys all did love it
so one of the reasons I do love this
mascara is because it has a comb on the
end and it's not just the typical brush
I notice that it really grasps onto your
lashes and really extends them and makes
them look thicker than they already are
so I personally love clumpy lashes I do
this every single day I feel like if
without my mascara I don't feel like a
girl I don't know that's really weird
but I always feel like a little boy
without mascara I like them like that
because then I don't have to wear fake
eyelashes and I I am lucky I was born
with pretty long eyelashes so if yours
aren't really really long to begin with
they're not gonna look exactly like mine
but let me tell you they really do go
from kind of small to like really really
long like this so if you guys don't like
clumpy lashes and you don't want to
watch this tutorial please just skip on
by don't write anything mean below
because I know a lot of people feel very
strongly about these lashes I've had it
sleep pictures because people just had
crazy arguments on it so for those of
you who did want it this one is for you
and I hope you all enjoy and if you want
to learn how to get clumpy spider lashes
like me please keep watching bye guys
first I'm just gonna be applying one
coat of my L'Oreal telescopic mascara
one thing I do when I'm doing my first
coat is I kind of coat the top and
bottom part of my lashes like this so
I'll brush up and then down up down and
that's going to really get all your
lashes covered
so once I've done one coat then I will
do my bottom lashes and that's going to
let the first coat dry a little bit and
the reason I like doing that is because
if you let it dry and you don't try and
layer it while it's wet it's going to
add length and it's also going to be
adding volume
and one thing I always do on my bottom
lashes is I'll kind of wiggle it and by
doing that that's gonna really grasp the
hair so it's going to help make them
again as long as possible so now I'm
going to do the same thing and just do
another coat
now of course as many coats as I did is
optional I'd like mine really spider
like an clumpy but I know a lot of
people do have a problem with that but
one thing I also do when I apply my
mascara is once I have enough coats on I
just take a little bit more on my brush
and I wiggle the top of the lashes and
it just extends them a little bit so I
go like this
so I'd be lying if I told you you're not
going to get mascara either on your
eyelids or underneath your eyes or even
on your nose all of your face because it
does happen and it even happens to me so
one thing I always have on my makeup
vanity are q-tips and I use them for
everything whether it's eye shadow
makeup to my ears so many different uses
so they really are important so I'm
going to do is I'm just going to get it
a little bit wet and I'm just going to
go over wherever I want to erase the
mascara
I don't know why but I guess the topic
of controversy seems to be the color of
my eyes but I promise you they are
really blue that white ring you see
around my eyes because I do have a ring
light around my camera and yeah other
than that I don't really know what else
to say but I promise you they're my real
blue eyes I was born with them so that
is how I do my clumpy lashes I hope you
all enjoyed and maybe learned a few
things another thing that you guys can
do is if you're in a hurry and you want
it to be a faster process you can either
turn a fan on or you can even do it in
your car and have the air kind of
blowing in and it dries the lashes
quicker so you therefore you can do
quicker coats and then yeah you can do
it in like two minutes so I hope this
helped guys and I will see you all soon
see
