those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and today I'm going to be
teaching you how to get this hairdo
right here it's super fluffy and I have
been doing it a lot lately and you guys
have been requesting it for a couple of
months now I've been doing it a lot and
I found some new techniques that help
really keep it nice and fluffy
throughout the day
please make sure that you subscribe to
my channel by clicking the subscribe
button right below right over here and
also click that bow so you can get post
notifications every time I post which is
every Wednesday and Sunday and on
occasion I'm gonna be throwing in a
third video so if you guys want to see
how I got this hairdo right here then
please keep watching so there's two ways
you can do this you can either curl your
hair after or before if I want it like
super full and fluffy if I curl my hair
first I find that it works a little bit
better keeps it a little bit more
voluminous so I have this beautiful
looking curling iron and I'm gonna just
take pieces so I just like to split my
hair down the middle so I like to split
down the middle and then bring all of my
hair to the front and I'm just gonna
start grabbing pieces and start curling
since we are putting it in a ponytail
you don't need to make it perfect you
just want to have like that curl and
that texture in your hair because it's
gonna make it look much better once it's
up so you can use a regular curling iron
it doesn't have to be this exact one I
was like leave a little piece because I
don't want to be like curl curl that
wanted to be more of like a lady looking
ponytail so I'm just gonna continue the
same thing over my entire head and you
don't have to go all the way up to the
root because again we are doing a
ponytail so you're not gonna see it so
if you guys have shorter hair and you
want to add extensions to this look you
can do the same process just curl your
hair and then you can curl your
extension separately you don't want to
put them in before the ponytail so I'll
just show you guys like one little tip
that I used to do when my hair wasn't
long and
I wanted my ponytail super long you
don't need to go crazy again just kind
of wrap whatever pieces you come to you
can always touch it up once the ponytail
is in as well
so just do as much as you feel you need
to so I used to always do my ponytail
and then curl it and one time I was
curling my hair and I hated how it
looked so I ended up doing the ponytail
and that was this day right here and my
ponytail is much fluffier and it stayed
much longer than normal so that's why I
always like to do this first if I want
my ponytail to be like massive so now
that we have some waves in the hair
normally if I could do a ponytail I'm
standing in front of my sink and my
mirror in my bathroom so for today's
video I'm just gonna use my little
setting spray it's it's facial spray but
they don't do the same thing so I'm
gonna spray the front part of my hair a
little bit and I have this little brush
this thing is literally like 10 years
old but it works wonders so I always
like to kind of smooth everything back
first and then I'll go in and I feel
like the key to making this work is to
keep on smoothing it so really quickly
before I do my ponytail oh my god I look
cute right about my hair looks fine here
we go so if you guys do have extensions
and you want to do a ponytail what I
used to do was I would look down and I
would take this hair right here like
this I'll just give you a quick little
so what I would do is take a elastic and
tie a little ponytail right here so
depending on how high so basically like
this as you guys can see if you secure
that with an elastic and you take your
clip in extensions what you would do is
you would clip them and wrap it around
that ponytail so say you want to do like
three tracks for tracks whatever you
want to do you would just clip it right
on to the ponytail wrap it around and
clip each one all around the ponytail so
in the end your ponytails
something like this but then when you
pull all of your hair back over its
gonna cover it and it's gonna give you
that length and it's not gonna hurt your
hair as much as if you were to like clip
them upside down which I've seen people
do as well so now I always like to I'm
scared I have a candle right behind me
so I always like to use my fingers first
to kind of get all the hair into place I
like my ponytails like super super high
instant facelift as well and I always
like to like push out my little baby
hairs because my forehead is showing
more months it deserves its own zip code
so we want to cover it up a little bit
so I'm gonna take my brush and I'm gonna
start smoothing it out so depending on
how messy you want it sometimes I like
it like a little bit messy looking but I
still like to get it really smooth
because when I'm applying the elastics
sometimes it's hard to it like it's
never as perfectly tight as right before
you put the elastic and put my hair
super thick so I think that's why it's
super hard for me
super super so I always like to do
underneath as well and I just keep
adjusting it until I feel it's smooth
enough and I have so much hair so if
it's not perfect underneath it's fine
especially because it's super puffy and
it's gonna be covered anyway yeah the
key is just a smooth and just keep
readjusting your hands so you can get it
as tight as humanly possible okay so I
feel like I got it pretty tight like
good enough I have these elastics right
here and what I always like to do
because I like to have it stay up I
found that if I put the elastic in
looking like just straight like this
it'll look good but I feel like it
doesn't stay as high so what I like to
do so flip your head over and then you
take the elastic and then pull your hair
through so that way it's still just as
tight and then you pull the elastic as
tight as possible switch
same thing took it and then pull the
hair and throw again these hair ties
that I bought are like thick hair so
it's gonna let me do it four times which
is nice now after the fourth one I can
like sit back up
so I always like to pull like my little
things out and like smooth anything that
doesn't look right and then because my
hair's too thick and I like it extra
tight I'm gonna go in with another hair
tie so this one I could put in normally
but that way you can wrap it under the
other ponytail and get it even tighter
than it was before
and then what this also does is which
I'll show you in a minute
by adding two hair ties and it's hard to
tell because my hair is black so what
this does and you can even extend it a
little more is it gives height to your
ponytail which is what we want because
it's gonna look that much better
so you wanna make sure its extended on
your head and then what I like to do
this is like my hack that I've done
forever
I used it's called gray away and it's
just like a spray for I guess it's
really made for people if they have gray
roots or whatever but my hair I I need
to die but B it's always lighter in the
front and I don't want to look like I'm
balding so what I like to do I cover my
face and I lightly fill it in and I do
this all around
and you want to be careful with it
because if it's too dark it's gonna look
fake so you just gotta like lightly and
then if you've spread a little further
back you can like push it into your
hairline that way you don't have like a
crazy like line and then it looks like
you have fake hair so we don't want that
and then you have a nice black finger so
make sure you always wash that off so if
you have any areas that you need to
secure you can just take a bobby pin I
think mine's pretty fine maybe like one
over here I'm gonna take a little bit of
hairspray this one is super fine strong
hairspray by Oram worried I don't want
to say it and just like very lightly go
over I don't like to use a lot of
hairspray I don't want it to look like
too sleek so that I might like to do is
I like to take up little piece of hair
from underneath the ponytail so you guys
can see what the two ponytails give as
far as height so I'm gonna take a little
piece from underneath and I'm gonna
smooth that around the elastic so that
way you don't see the little ponytail
holders and then I'm just gonna pin it
with her like a bobby pin in the back so
that way it stays good spray that as
well and then I have my dry bar it's
called triple sec it's like a texture
spray so I love to spray that into my
hair to give it even more texture I love
this smell of it and once your hair is
up you can go over any pieces that you
maybe want a little bit more curled so
like these front pieces I always like to
do
please go over
and there you have it it's super easy it
takes like under 10 minutes and I love
to do this when I don't feel like
washing my hair so I usually go like two
days where my hair will look good down
and then on the third day I will do like
a ponytail and then wash it the next day
because I'm lazy and honestly my hair
takes forever to dry so this is just
something I'd love to do if you guys
feel you don't have enough body you can
take that same brush and just kind of
like back comb some of the pieces to
give it like some more body I don't
wanna do too much because it's already
like so poofy and I don't want to be
like your ginormous which it kind of
already is I'm gonna use a little
hairspray right here so this parts like
smooth that's really it
that's really all that I do so it's
pretty easy but I think this hairstyle
is cool because you could literally wear
it with sweats and keep it casual
or you can wear it for a night out or a
special occasion really whatever you
guys are feeling
so this is the final result thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
learned some new tricks that you can
apply to your own hair I highly suggest
trying this ponytail out even if you're
not a fan of ponytails because a it's
off of your neck and your back so the
warmer months that are coming you're
gonna appreciate a nice hairdo off of
your neck and your back because it'll
help you stay less hot and more cool and
although you might have a little bit of
a headache after a couple of hours it's
worth it and I just personally love my
hair like this so I hope you guys enjoy
it thank you so much for watching please
