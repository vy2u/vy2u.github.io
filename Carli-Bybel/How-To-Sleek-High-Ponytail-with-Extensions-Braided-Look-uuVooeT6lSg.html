the pretty side
my jigsaw
on my
hi everyone thank you for watching so
about a year and a half ago I had posted
a video teaching you guys how I did this
high sleek ponytail look with my
extensions but ever since then I
actually found a new easier quicker
technique so in this video I just wanted
to show you my new technique how I do it
because it's super easy and it
definitely does not give you a headache
like the last look that I posted and I'm
also going to show you how I do a high
braided look as well so if you guys want
to learn how to get it with the
extensions please keep watching and I'll
show you how so the new way that I put
the extensions in when I do a ponytail
is a little bit different but it's
definitely more effective and it lasts
longer and in my opinion it looks better
so what I do is to find the correct spot
I usually look down and I draw a little
circle where I would be normally putting
my ponytail so this would be about where
my ponytail would be so I'm just going
to push away all the other hair so then
I'm just going to be applying it lastik
and creating a small ponytail
then I'm going to be taking my
extensions these are the 22 inch 220
grams from Bellamy and the first one I'm
going to be taking has the four clips on
it and I'm just going to be clipping the
hair right around the ponytail and
you're going to clip it right around it
so it's going to go in a circular motion
so this would be your first piece and
you're going to continue the same thing
with however many extensions that you
normally would use I'm just going to be
using three track
so next I'm taking my hairspray I
actually just picked this one up today
from Walgreens
it's the bio fusion daily rosemary mint
medium hold hairspray and I haven't
tried it yet so this is going to be my
first time but it's definitely new so I
wanted to try it out and I'm just going
to be spraying the front of my hair and
as I pull it up I'm going to be spraying
the bottom as well I'm using a smoothing
brush with some fine bristles just to
make sure that it's nice and smooth and
before I start putting it up into the
ponytail I just like smoothing it back
so that way once I'm holding the hair up
it's going to be a lot easier
once you've gotten it really smooth
you're then just gonna use your elastic
and tighten it
and I'm going to be applying more
hairspray to the top and also on the
bottom
and then what I like to do since I do
have shorter liars I like to take a
little piece from each side and wrap it
around the ponytail that way no matter
what color hair tie you're using I have
a clear one which you can really see in
my hair it will just cover that up
really nicely and it'll give it a nice
sleek finished look
you
then you can just fasten it with couple
bobby pins
it's what happened
and then you're all finished and it
looks like a perfect ponytail blends
really really nicely and honestly this
way it doesn't give you as much of a
headache as the other way that I
originally had taught you guys and
you'll see if you try this way out it's
going to feel so much more comfortable
and it's going to look a lot more
natural and I always do this so this is
my little technique that I've learned
and I just really quickly wanted to show
you a second option because lately I
have been berating the ponytail as well
so if you guys want to you can do a
fishtail braid or just a regular braid
and I will show you how I do that put
your hair into three sections and just
braid it normally
and I bought these little hair ties
there the little rubber ones for the
bottoms
so this is the final result I hope you
guys learned something new in this video
and if you were ever wondering how to
style your hair with extensions to get
this really nice sleek look this is
definitely the way to do it I posted a
video I would say about a year ago and
when I came across this technique it
just honestly it was so much easier and
it gave me way less of a headache so I
worn this for a couple hours at a time
and had no problems at all so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you guys next time
I got the pretty side
