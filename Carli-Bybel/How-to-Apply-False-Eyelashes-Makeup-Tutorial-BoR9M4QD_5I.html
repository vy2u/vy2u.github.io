I'm sorry it's been so long since I
uploaded a tutorial I had one of my
wisdom teeth removed and it was probably
the worst pain I've ever felt in my life
I do have a very low pain tolerance I
got a dry socket so just prolong the
experience but I'm all better now so I
promise you I'll be updating all this
week in this tutorial I'll be showing
you how to apply false lashes I had a
lot of requests on how to do that and
also if you are interested in how I did
my makeup please keep watching and I
will teach you that as well so thank you
so much and have a great time so when it
comes to applying false lashes a lot of
people do have some trouble with it and
I've had a couple people ask me how I do
it and I think it's really not that hard
it does take a little bit of practice it
does take some getting used to but if
you do it the correct way once you put
your mascara on you don't even feel them
so what I'm using is mod lash and you
can get these at Walgreens CVS and this
is what they look like do you want to
need is the eyelashes a bobby pin and
eyelash glue I love this glue it's um
it's white but then it dries clear they
sell the dark brown glue but I found
that that really didn't work as well for
me so what you're going to do is you're
going to just squeeze a little bit out
and you're going to apply it
on your eyelash right on the line
like that
sometimes if you put it on right away
you're gonna find that they're gonna
slide all over the place ins me a lot
harder so I always blow on it a couple
seconds just because you'll notice it'll
turn a darker white color and it'll
stick easier so once you put it on a no
sight and won't be sliding around if you
put it in the right put the glue on you
do want to make sure that if the
eyelashes are a little too long you can
always trim them mine I have bigger eyes
so the way that they come usually fit my
eyes but if they're a little too big you
can just snip a little bit off of them
when you see the glue I don't know if
you could see it it starts to turn like
a darker white color that's when you
know that it's right so what you're
going to do is I cut I hold it from both
ends
this and I always place the end right
where my eye ends
and you're gonna push it down on each
corner and this is when you when you use
the body pin you're gonna push it down
and you want to make sure it's right up
against your lash line that way it looks
as natural as possible
you just want to press against the
entire and I'm trying to make sure that
they are on good
that's the third you see the white still
but once it dries it dries clear which
is really good
sometimes your bottom lashes get stuck
so you can use the opposite side and
just kind of do it like that you just
want to wait a couple seconds and then
you can apply your mascara you need to
blend once you put your mascara on
they'll feel less heavy and then it
blends your actual lashes in with them
so they look a lot more natural
these lashes are number 45 okay said
they came in if you like my makeup right
here if you keep watching I will show
you how to finish off this look
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
