the
I'm gonna burn
young
full
come on
hi guys thank you for watching so I'm
here with my friend Sam and we're going
to show you how to do hair extensions
today so I know a lot of you have heard
a lot about her so I want you to meet
her this is the famous Samantha Morales
yeah the famous DJ makes the meet you
all
so this is actually she's never worn
extensions in her life until a couple
days ago so I'm gonna show you how I put
them in myself and then I'm going to
show you how to put them in on somebody
else so if you want to learn how to get
hair like this keep watching bye guys I
finally found a company that I can get a
coupon code for you guys so that's what
was taking so long but the name of the
company is called Bellamy hair
extensions and their hair extensions are
amazing they're super super soft and
these are the 20 inches this is actually
them cut I cut them a little bit because
they were even longer so I don't mention
if you could see I'll post the picture
of this dress but it's from szabo skirt
um you have to check their website out I
know a lot of you were asking or got
that black lace shirt from my other
video too and that one's also Saba skirt
I'll put a link to their website below
they have honestly hands-down the cutest
stuff ever so go check them out and I
hope you enjoy this tutorial the
extensions come with five tracks and
they also come with a couple single ones
the single ones are good for up on top
of your hair I don't ever use those so
I'm going to show you how I put in the
20 inch extensions one thing I'll do for
thickness is I will clip two pieces
together and that way underneath it
makes the hair look thicker so the first
two pieces that I'm using have three
they're the two small ones three clips
and then the two clips so I'm going to
clip on right onto the hair like this
you
so it's doubled like that and this is
just gonna add again sickness when
you're putting them in you're going to
want to start all the way at the bottom
of your hair and you're going to leave
about this much down depending on how
long you're keeping them in you can
tease the area where the clips are going
to be if you want to normally I won't
tease my hair just because it just stays
in but you can that is an option so what
you're going to do is take the clips
take a small piece of hair I always
twist it a little bit and then I clip
the hair right up on mice right up by my
scalp and again take a piece clip take a
piece this
oh that's your how you do your first
piece you're going to take down again
the same amount of hair this much click
the rest off the next one I'm using is
the other one with the three clips and
again since he's just kind of like the
whole area it helps the clips and longer
and again twist
and now you're going to go right by your
ears and drag your hair back and this is
going to be the last section now you're
going to have two more pieces of hair
and they both have four clips each so if
you hold them up you'll see one of
them's a little bit shorter so you're
going to again double clip ease like I
had done with the other ones so again
you're just clipping them on the back
hi everyone this is Sam hi my friend to
me do so clearly Sam doesn't need
extensions because her hair is super
long but it's just going to add a little
bit more length to it so we're going to
show you how to do that
woo all right so the first thing that
you are doing is sectioning off your
hair and we're going to like this much
so turn to the side so they can see just
like a little bit at the bottom but I
have to straight my hair for its like
I've been putting on line or it is no
you know you can do it once again
alright so again it comes with five
different tracks so you are going to use
two smallest ones first three clips and
then the two clips and you're going to
put the two over the three so it's
thicker at the bottom
like that
you
you
whisper the sweetest words and if your
making that a taster
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
