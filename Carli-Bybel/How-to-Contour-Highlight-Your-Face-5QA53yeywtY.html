I'm going to be showing you how to
contour and highlight your face this has
been highly requested for a couple weeks
now and I've finally got around to
making it basically by highlighting and
contouring your face it makes your face
appear more thin like your nose it makes
it look smaller because you're
contouring the sides and also your cheek
so basically it's just putting shadows
in certain parts and it's highlighting
other parts so that way when the light
hits you it's going to make your face
with your more glowy and give it a
bronzed nice look to it also if you
follow my facebook page I posted
something about doing a V log about I
guess a little bit about myself if you
guys want to know anything I know
there's a couple questions that have
been asked over and over again and it's
it's hard to answer every single person
I do try my best but basically if there
are any questions that you want to know
about me or if you do want to see some
sort of V log you can comment below and
I guess like whatever question you like
the best and then I'll have one of those
videos up next week so thank you so much
for watching and enjoy first I'm
applying my favorite foundation with my
Mac dual fiber brush I'm using L'Oreal
magic smooth souffle and this is going
to be going all over my entire face one
of the reasons I love this foundation is
because I feel like since it's not a
liquid it doesn't seep into my pores or
clog my pores first taking my Sonia
Kasia concealer quad and the lightest
color I'm going to be applying this
right underneath my eyes this is the
first step in highlighting what this
does is going to remove any dark circles
or any bags
in order to blend this in you're going
to want to Pat the concealer you don't
want to smear it in because otherwise it
won't cover anything and it won't stay
lighter in this area
when you're highlighting underneath your
eyes you're basically going to make a
sideways triangle that way you're
starting in by your nose and dragging it
out towards your eyes and you're also
going to bring it all the way down to
around your nostrils
going back to my concealer quad you're
going to take the bottom which is like a
loose powder and you're going to apply
this over your concealer just to set the
concealer if you don't have this quad
you can use any kind of translucent
powder
taking the darker color concealer I'm
then going to be applying this right
underneath my cheekbones you'll see like
a line where your cheekbone starts if
you put this underneath it's going to
help accentuate your cheekbones and make
them pop out more
using a brown eyeshadow make sure that
it's matte I'm going to be taking a
little bit of this on my finger and
going over that same line where I had
just highlighted below since you had
just placed the concealer underneath it
and then you're using such a dark color
it's going to make such a drastic change
so it's gonna make your cheekbones pop
out more
of course this looks super funny right
now but I promise once you blend it it
looks really good
I'm then going to be doing the same
thing to the sides of my nose this is
going to make your nose appear smaller I
had a couple of you asked what you can
do to make your nose smaller well just
by contouring the sides of them it
really does make a difference you're
going to want to drag it up to almost
where your eyebrows are and you're going
to also want to do it underneath your
nose
then taking any kind of fluff brush
you're just going to want to blend the
size of your nose in
I'm then using a Mac blush brush and
also my L'Oreal True Match powder the
name of this one is called Coco it's I
think the darkest shade that they make
this is what I'm going to be using for
my bronzer you're going to be applying
this right above that dark brown line
and blending it in upwards
besides contouring your cheeks you're
also going to be applying this on the
sides of your forehead also underneath
your chin and along your jawline don't
forget to drag this down onto your neck
so that way your neck matches your face
you then can go back to the duel fiber
brush and just blend in your entire face
that way the lines aren't as sharp and
it just all looks way more natural
then taking my Mac mineralized blush
which is my favorite it's called love
thing and a Mac blush brush I'm going to
be applying this on my cheeks
I'm making this face you can see really
where the apples of your cheeks are and
that's where you're going to want to
apply it
I'm then lining my lips with my Jordana
cosmetics lip liner this is my favorite
lip liner because it's basically skin
color so it's very natural
taking this mac pigment it's called
vanilla I'm then just going to be
applying a little bit of this on the
Cupid's bow of my lips this is again to
highlight and I'm also going to apply it
right above my cheekbones this is also
going to just give your face a little
bit of a shine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
