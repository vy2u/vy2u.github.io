miss nothing that they could be the
better half
always trying to make
hi everyone thank you for watching so
I've been getting a lot of emails and a
lot of comments asking what can I do to
make my eyes appear bigger or how can I
try your makeup looks out if I have
smaller eyes or hooded eyes or droopy
eyelids or anything of this sort so I
wanted to put together this tutorial for
all of you because I know it's been long
overdue and there are a few special
techniques that I do on a lot of my
looks which in turn do make my eyes
appear larger so I'm just going to do a
step by step tutorial showing you a
pretty neutral look but where to apply
the color so you know how to make your
eyes look as big as you want them to
look and you want to emphasize them as
much as you possibly could so one thing
to remember is I never went to makeup
school so my techniques may be different
from other people but I've been more of
a trial and error kind of girl so I've
tried millions of different things and
the way that I do it now is basically
the way I've been doing it for the past
two years and it's how I've been very
happy so oh and also I've earrings on
this is not weird I think this is the
first time I'm wearing earrings in 10
years maybe and I'm not even being
dramatic I don't ever wear earrings and
I have so many fun earrings ludora
boutique and makes these earrings if you
follow makeup by camilla i'm sure you've
seen them as well but she sent me a
bunch of them and I love them and I had
to try them out so I don't really know
how I feel about them it's not that
they're not gorgeous I love earrings and
I love how they look I just feel like on
me I don't know I'm not used to it it's
just different and also you can probably
already see my ears are turning a little
red because my ears are very sensitive
so they start to hurt after a while so
if you want to learn a couple tricks
that I personally do please keep
watching and I'll show you how the first
thing that I'm going to be using is a
concealer and this is just going to be
the first thing that I'm going to be
using as a concealer and this I'm going
to be using as an eyeshadow base mine is
by Laura Mercier and I'm just going to
be using the lighter color I'm just
going to be applying this all over my
entire eyelid
one of my favorite highlighters to use
on my eyes as a shadow base and again
also to highlight is by Mac and it's a
mineralized skinfinish and this one is
called soft and gentle and again I love
this because you can use it for a multi
purposes and it is big so it does last
very long I'm just going to be applying
this color all over my entire eyelid and
also underneath my brow for those with
small eyes you do want to place the
lightest color all over the lid
you
one thing that's really good is to
highlight around your tear duct because
that's going to really open up your eye
and it's going to make it appear
brighter and what's really good is I'm
just using neutral colors but the
technique is the same for basically any
look remember if you do have smaller
eyes you don't want to put any dark
colors in the inner part of your eye and
you don't want to put too thick of
eyeliner because it will make your
eyelids heavy and it will make them
appear smaller so this technique you can
use with any colors that you do choose
just use the lights where I say the
lights and the darks where I tell you to
use the darks so for this look I'm going
to be using this quad by Maybelline and
it's almost empty which one is this
this one is called strutted suede and
it's clearly my favorite as you can see
this color is missing this was actually
a champagne color which would be perfect
if you wanted to try this quad out you
don't even need to get a champagne color
but I love this because it does come
with the neutral colors and it's perfect
for creating dimensions in your eyes
which is going to make your eyes appear
bigger it's all about where you put the
colors and how you shade it so I'm going
to show you how I use each of these
colors to make my eyes larger one of the
most important brushes is this one by
Mac and it is number 224 and it's a
blending brush and this one really is
going to help you achieve this look
because it's going to be doing all a
blending for you and because the
bristles are nice and big and fluffy
it's gonna again make this a lot easier
for you so I'm going to be taking this
lightest color and with this I'm just
going to be applying this right into my
crease and with this color since it is
almost a skintone color you can be a
little bit more messy with this you
don't have to make it directly in your
crease
you
also one thing that I do is I'm going to
extend my crease where you put the light
part for your tune-up you're going to
want to apply this color over that so
it's going to keep the light area still
light but it's just going to give it a
nice little shadow right above it in
this color I just dragged up to blend
into the top and also down and yeah it's
just going to give it a nice blended
natural look so already you can start
seeing there's dimension now it's just
not all one color and this color again
goes throughout all the crease taking
the next color with that same Mac brush
I'm also going to be applying this in my
crease with this color you're going to
want to direct it a little bit more in
the crease and not so much out as far
I'm pressing a lot lighter down on the
brush so the bristles aren't going like
crazy everywhere like I was doing with
the previous color
and you're going to want to focus this
color on the outer part of your eye
because that's where you're going to
want the most dimension
like that so now we're going to be
taking the darkest color in the quad
with my Mac pencil brush and this is
number 210 no 219 and I'm going to be
using this brush because it does have
small bristles and it gives you very
controlled motion on so where you're
going to be applying this color and one
thing you don't want to do is apply too
much of it too and you don't apply it
too high and you don't want it to go too
far into your eyelid because that is
going to weigh down your eyelid so what
I'm going to be doing is I want to be
taking a little bit of this color and
I'm going to be drawing it on my outer V
like this and what you can do is if you
keep your eye open and you look shared
ahead you don't want this dark color to
go any higher than like about here like
I've seen some people that extend it to
like up here and I don't like how that
looks so I again just keep it to about
right when I'm looking straight ahead so
it's just going to be right about where
my crease is and another way you can
find how high you want to go is if you
just a little bit of that color and you
draw a line from underneath your eye and
you extend it that's where you know you
don't want your color to go any further
than that and then you can just kind of
drag it a little bit into your eye and
that's really where you're going to want
to put your darkest color no matter if
it's black or whatever color you are
using then I'm going to be taking this
Mac 217 brush which is another blending
brush it's just a little bit smaller
bristles and taking a little bit of that
dark color I'm just going to be blending
it into my crease and into the other
colors
if you do strokes like that this is just
going to kind of extend the color out a
little bit without making it too harsh
you
so for eyeshadow technique that is my
technique on how to make it appear
bigger you want to put your lightest
color on the base and under your eyebrow
and you want to put the darkest color on
the outer corners but you do again want
to put some sort of color and around
your crease because that's going to
really accentuate your eyes and make
them appear larger which is what we're
doing here today for eyeliner I'm using
my Mac it's called black truck and it's
a gel liner it's the one that I always
use it looks like this but you can buy
one from Maybelline from Walgreens and
it comes it's basically the same thing
and it comes with this brush that I'm
actually going to be using right now
it's perfect for doing the eyeliner and
one thing you definitely don't want to
do is apply a thick black line when
you're doing this because if you do a
thicker line it's going to make your
eyelid heavier which is going to make
your eyes look smaller so what I do is I
try and stay as close to my lash line as
possible and this is what's going to
make my eyes look longer and bigger and
what I do is I extend my tail longer
than I normally would for a look like
this so you're just gonna take a little
bit on the brush and remember to do is
in sections you don't need to rush
through this
you
so depending on how small your eyes
really are you can just do the outer
corner of your eye to make it appear
longer but one thing that I've recently
been doing for the past I guess a year
now is I just need a little bit on the
brush and I actually extend the line in
my tear duct which is going to make my
eyes longer which in turn will also make
them bigger
another thing that I sometimes do is if
I make my tail longer than I expected or
if I want it longer if you take that
same pencil brush and this dark color
take this brush and you apply it right
where your eye crease starts you can
extend it which is going to make your
eye look larger as well
you
another thing that you can really do
that's going to make your eyes pop and
it's not going to weigh them down is by
using individual false lashes I know a
lot of you probably like see these and
get scared and run the other way because
that's what I did for ever until about
this year but if you buy them and they
come with the glue you can get like at
the starter kit where it comes with
everything to try it this is really I
just put two of them right on the outer
corners and that's just going to extend
your eye as well so I'm going to show
you how I do it and I mean this part is
completely optional but I did notice
that it makes my eyes appear larger so
this is what I do it comes with a mini
tweezer if you get the starter kit but
I'm just using my normal tweezer that I
use and you're just going to pick out
one of the lashes and you're just going
to take a little bit of the glue and
you're going to apply it right on the
outer part of your eye
then you're going to repeat the same
thing in just put one more on so can't
really probably seem yet but once I put
the mascara on you'll see as usual I'm
using by L'Oreal telescopic mascara
my only mascara I use it's so funny
because everyone hates my clumpy
eyelashes and I honestly think clumpy
eyelashes are amazing like I like them
stick and chunky because then you don't
have to wear fake ones besides the
little individuals if you want and from
far away you can see them so if you
don't like my Colombian lashes that's
completely fine everyone has their own
opinion this is how I like mine so I'm
sure a lot of you have heard people
putting black eyeliner in their tear
duct of their eye if you have small eyes
do not do that because that actually
closes your eye what you can do is use a
white eye pencil like this mine is from
Rimmel and you're just going to apply
this right in your tear duct and this is
just going to make the whites of your I
appear larger so this will make it maybe
appear a little bit bigger I don't
normally do this but I will show you how
to do it if you do want to try it out so
you just apply it right into the tear
duct and it's going to tickle and you
will have to apply it like reapply this
because since it is touching your eye
and it never really dries it's not going
to stay that well but yeah again all
those steps are optional together I
personally like to do them usually all
together because I like my eyes to
appear larger and if you guys were
wondering for on my lips I used miss by
Mac which is my new nude lipstick which
a lot of you have recommended to me so
thank you because I love it and I mix
that with coral bliss which is a nice
peachy color so that is how I did my
makeup look remember you can switch the
colors around and make it your own using
the techniques that I showed you this
will make your eyes appear larger I hope
this all helps you a lot and thank you
all so much for watching and I'll see
you guys soon
I've been waiting
I am so long so long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
