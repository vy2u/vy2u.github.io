hi everybody thank you for watching so
I'm currently sitting in my upstairs
hallway I have a big mirror behind me
and I figured this would be the best
spot to cut my hair I have not cut my
hair and probably at least two years I
think the last time that I cut it was
actually on camera for you guys so
however long ago that was which is crazy
we've been in this house a year and a
half and I definitely have not caught it
since we've lived here so I figured it
was time I was going to the bathroom and
my hair was touching my toilet and I
just felt like it was a little bit
unnecessary so we're going to trim it
today I'm asking for anything crazy I'm
just going to trim the dead ends off and
maybe cut some like angles in the front
because my angle is all the way down to
there when they used to be like up to
here so I don't really know how much I'm
going to cut off I'm just going to kind
of wing it and see it happen so if you
guys want to see how I cut my hair at
home then please keep watching so this
is all my own hair I'll show you guys
how long it really is because I feel
like usually in a video I'm like this
close to the camera so all you see is
like up to here but this is how long it
is so it literally goes to my butt crack
it took me probably like four five years
to grow it this long you guys can look
back on my channel and you'll see how
short my hair used to be it was like up
to here and wouldn't grow for the
longest time really quickly I know I've
talked about this before but for those
of you who are wondering how I did grow
it so long I started getting keratin
treatments probably like three years ago
my hair is naturally very very frizzy
and curly so because of that I was
constantly blow-drying it and using a
lot of heat just to get it like sleek
and straight and not frizzy so when I
started doing the keratin treatments it
took away all the frizz and my hair
would air Drive just like straights
wouldn't really have to do anything so
what I do is I shower at night always
and then I let it air dry a little bit
and then I put it in a braid and then
when I wake up it's dry and it has some
waves in it so this morning I just blew
it out with a blow dryer but it was
already dry so it took maybe like 5-10
and then I just went over some of the
front pieces with a straightener because
my hair has grown out a lot so that is
really all I've done I haven't taken any
pills I haven't really done anything
special I just eat really healthy I
drink a lot of water and I try to avoid
heat at all cost so that has just been
what works for me but another thing I
wanted to mention before I get into the
tutorial is if you guys do like a lot of
layers and you like that chop and look I
used to have that and I was this close
to thinking about doing it again and I'm
like you know what I'm just gonna let it
grow a little bit more if you cut your
hair make sure you tell your hairstylist
I would say like right at the end of
your eyebrows if you draw a line all the
way back and like do like a half up half
down what I used to do when I would do
chopping layers is I would never ever
touch this hair down here because the
baldness hair down here is all one
length it can grow really long and it'll
be like sick and healthy what happened
was when I first got my hair cut and
they did a lot of layers they were
cutting layers like all the way through
my hair so the longest part of my hair
was so so so thin that I would just keep
breaking so if you guys are trying to
brought your hair the key is to have
enough hair on the bottom half that's
all one length that can grow together
and it won't break as easily so that's
just like a little tip that I have if
you guys do want that choppy layered
look my hair is basically all one length
at this point some pieces are a little
shorter but the front pieces you could
see are like a little bit shorter from
where my angles used to be but like I
said I haven't cut my hair and so long
so I don't even know what's going on
over here
so what I'm going to use for today's
video is just a pair of scissors I get
these on Amazon they are haircutting
scissors before I get so many people
freaking out on me because I know
anytime I do a video like this all the
hairdressers come and tell me I'm doing
it wrong and I'm using the wrong
scissors and all that but these are
haircutting scissors so if you guys
don't agree with how I cut it I'm sure
there's other YouTube tutorials on here
that can teach you a different technique
but this is just what I personally do
I'm going to clip up my hair I'm going
to start with the bottom half so I'm
just going to like clip up right where
my ears are so just like put in a bun I
have a towel underneath me so hopefully
all the hair will end up
I'll have baby try sleeping right here
see you mrs. enroll over there
your little head below oh so what I
always do is I with my finger
separate the hair right down the middle
like this and I always bring it to the
front now I know when you get your hair
done at a salon they usually cut it wet
I always like to do it dry something
that I've always done and I also like to
make sure it's straight when I'm doing
it does need to be like pin pin pin
straight but I just blew it out so that
way I can see like where my hair is
going to fall I'm going to use my
fingers feel free to use the comb or a
brush just what I'm doing and I'm pretty
far away from the mirror but I'm going
to do it once it's brushed out I take my
fingers almost as if it was like a
straightener and I drag it all the way
down to the bottom and then we're going
to cut we're going to start with this
much off the bottom you know so that's
right and I'm just cutting it so I'm
going to do it again we're just going to
make sure it's all brushed out and I'm
going to take my fingers run it to the
bottom make sure it's all straight and
then cut the edges the straight line and
the reason I like to bring it all
forward and then cut it in a straight
line is once you put the hair back it'll
give you like a little bit of a V in the
back it's not going to be like perfectly
straight which is how I like it I do the
same thing to the other side this much
I'm just cutting the dead ends off I'm
basically doing a very light trim so if
I wasn't filming this right now I would
be standing up in my bathroom doing it
probably over the sink with the drain
shut it's a little bit easier to clean
up now we're going to go a little bit
further up and do the same thing tie it
up drag your fingers so here you can see
the shorter pieces and then the longer
so we're just going to align that all up
so even make that
same thing on this side
and as you're doing it you just want to
keep playing with it and putting it in
the front so you can make sure it's even
and all that
Seanie meeting girls wanna come say hi
I'm so beautiful with all my colors so
funny everyone keeps telling me to cut
my hair and I'm like no hey what do you
say when people tell me to cut my hair
what do you say when people tell me I
should cut my hair you're not eating my
hair try trying to eat my hair that I'm
cutting off I don't get as you like so
now this layer is done and we're just
going to keep repeating until we get to
the top so I'm going to do one more same
thing part it down the back so we're
just going to brush it out just make
sure it all lines up you could see right
now how much I took off every time I cut
it eyes like looking at it stop not for
you
so so when you do a little bit at a time
you can go back in and make sure it's
like perfect and that way you don't end
up taking too much off sometimes I guess
they'll just cut it a lot off and then
they have to go in and make sure it's
all even so that's why I do like a
little little bit at a time on that side
and then the top
like gum the girl from the ring so now
let's make sure the length is all good
which it should be click one hair
because the top part is usually the
shortest that's where I used to cut all
my layers anyway so should be good as
far as length let me just check on this
side as well yep perfect
I'm probably going to just cut these a
drop shorter but I do want to keep them
long so for the front parts of your hair
if you want to do like angles and you
look down to where your part ends you
just want to drag us down and put the
rest of the back so it's like this much
hair and you can see my angles look how
far down that they start so I'm going to
probably cut that much off so I'm going
to grab this and move this part down and
I'm going to make sure it's nice and
smooth and I'm going to cut in a
diagonal so I'm going to start with a
little bit
so the shortest piece is now here
so I just cut it on a day I can I'll
just make it a little bit better and
then what you want to do is you want to
just make sure the angle goes like in a
perfect diagonal I just hold that Cesare
down and I just start cutting a little
bit at a time and that way it makes it
more subtle like that
scrap it all we shared all flows
just can't wing it okay I want to grab
it all and then you know just cut it in
like a diagonal so once you get it even
you can pick out the rest of your hair
all I'm going to do I'm not going to cut
any layers in the back I may just like
let's see I may just like make this
angle a little bit deeper so I'm just
going to like cut a little bit off the
front pieces just so it almost flows
nicely so I just like I it this is
ecology my hair and that's it you guys
can see it looks nice and healthy now no
more dead ends and a little bit more of
an angle in the front that way when I
flip it or add curls it'll be up like a
little bit more volume so normally I
would take that short angle and I would
bring it back into the back and make
layers but not today
so that is how I cut my hair at home
might not be the right way to do it but
it's what I've been doing for again like
6 years now and I like it better that
way because then I can cut off as much
as I want because start with just a
little bit off and then you can go from
there and you have control over it so if
you guys have never done this before
maybe have somebody help you or take it
slow and only do a little bit at a time
it is hair so it will grow back I also
