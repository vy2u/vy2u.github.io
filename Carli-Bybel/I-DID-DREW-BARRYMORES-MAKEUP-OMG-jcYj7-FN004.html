today I have a very special yep to buy
more okay that's a play with all of her
amazing makeup she is the founder of
flower beauty and I know it just
launched at Ulta which is so huge and
feel to it and I'm so excited
congratulations thank you we've been at
Walmart for many years and we are in a
true beauty capital destination and I
love all time an Ulta shopper and I'm
just excited to expand the brand
somewhere people can get a hold of it
especially at all debts yeah what kind
of ultimate destination yeah perfect is
perfect I had the honor of doing her
makeup today and I got to use a lot of
the new products and they're amazing
I love my makeup so much and she did
something that I've never had done
before contoured her nose not that you
need it
I have to say I love it so mad yeah I
feel like you just opened the door yeah
I need to walk through it and live the
rest of my life like that I love that I
get lactating glimpses of myself and I
really love it so much yes never before
have I ever done this oh thank you oh my
gosh I'm so curious I feel like I'm the
one to do it because everyone that
watches my channel they know I spend
like hours on that
well then I'm so glad I was in your
hands for the first time I love it
I'm so happy so if you guys want to see
how we got this look right here and we
also tried a bunch of amazing lip
products many lips mini lips for lips 5
look before left yep for not too late'
nope so start off these look we're gonna
prime her face with the poor perfect in
simpler stick this is a foundation and
primer all in one which is really cool
they're gonna see how instantly
mattifies like I could argue CLG so name
I just blends your pores which I get
self-conscious because I have like over
the rainbow hazel patch looking horse
mojito and I just you have amazing skin
thank you so then we're gonna go in with
the new light illusion Foundation and l3
and I actually use that on my face today
so buy an illusion I did and I really
like it this foundation is really nice
because it covers really well yet it
leaves a natural luminous finish that
stays on all day and I've yet to kind of
see like an excitement like I have for
this yeah it's people are coming out of
the woodwork talking about it being like
holy grail and stuff and I'm so excited
because I just want to please people
address especially with skin and face
that's where I think the confidence is
really truly boosted yeah and then
everything else is game and play after
that oh good
if you ever dunk it in a glass of water
and moon if you come to the size of a
Buick
actually like how many yeah is my notice
before I was like oh yeah I know it's
bad so I'm actually gonna use your
favorite the poor perfect but I'm going
to use it in color 45 which is nutmeg
and I'm gonna add a little cream contour
I love contour yeah but I think that's
such a good dual purpose is yeah I love
that it has the primer in there and
especially for traveling it was like a
favorite movie that you've ever felt
different ones at different time yeah I
loved getting to do eat eat so come in
contour the nose a little bit do you
have anything you want ever caused by
your nose no I never do you never have
no do it
hey my nose is your hands perfect that's
like my favorite thing personally just
because I don't love my nose and I never
wanted to get a nose job so I that's
good for ya so I was like I'm just gonna
keep figuring out I saw you said you
hate your dark circles a lot I don't see
any darkness but a little trick if we
use a concealer with a little bit of
like a pink undertone first it's gonna
cancel out the darkness and then you can
layer it with light over it and I'll
you'll see and see that yeah this is
really nice this is the light illusion
full coverage concealer we're going to
use the color fair which has a little
bit of like that pink undertone for
years especially ever after having a two
kids I've been highlighting under my
concealer alone and it reflects the
light and it makes risen forward right
it brings it up and forward yeah which
is key but if I start doing it every day
no my problem did anyone tell you that
your eyebrows are so perfect it's insane
let's stop there with a dark shade
you're so sweet so we don't use a little
bit of powder set the concealer we are
using the flower miracle glow satin
finishing powder excited
use the little puff that comes with it
too it's so cute it's a good pot it's a
cute and I look for your finger it's
perfect
- what like inspired the name flower
like what made you choose that name
well I have Bobby flower films was the
company I started when I was 19 so we
produced all the movies that we made
okay
majority of the movies I made in my 20s
and 30s were all made by flower films so
when we talked about uh after I ended my
contract with covergirl which was just
the best time in the world and I got to
be Co creative director and work on the
campaigns and I sort of got like this
great college degree and I've been in a
makeup chair my whole life and all the
stars aligned and we talked about
starting this company so I thought oh
it's beauty we should like and for that
little I kept saying which I can't even
pronounce flu Oh French flower I was
like I know let's be highfalutin and cut
it flu yeah yeah and luckily the
gentleman's got a Sri so let's just see
if we could get flower and it was
available really which is crazy that is
crazy so bizarre gonna eight years ago
yeah I also just think everyone's a
different kind of flower and the flower
garden is so inclusive if you're a silly
wild flower or Daisy
great if you're annoying neat like
cabbage rose
if you're more of like a great red to it
it's thick it's like everyone's included
and I like that kind of you can be free
or fancy but everyone's welcome like
that's important I mean that is
important the new one a warrior a
warrior mascara I got so excited when I
saw the wand because I used to have a
favorite and I only work with cruelty
free brands which flowers cruelty free
which is amazing and I could not find a
mascara with the same type of head so
when I saw that I got so excited because
for me it makes the lashes I think super
long really thick really voluminous and
when I used it today I have lash
extensions on but it made them like
triple the size so I got so excited
about that I'm so glad we were giving it
all up volume warrior yeah but we
decided to go with lash warrior because
it was more explanatory we could expand
on the whole warrior concept yeah
because we just got really into like
capable badass women and empowerment and
this sort of more attitudinal fun
spirited line within the flour brown
because flour has a sort of inherent
femininity right right softness wonder
like let's get some warrior epithet yeah
and then from that has spawned all these
really fun ideas
so wonderful I wish I could start every
day like this next we're gonna use the
seal the deal hydrating setting spray
this is the Dewey one I'm gonna spray
that all over and that's gonna help the
powder all melt together do whatever for
the eyes I mean literally your clay I'm
usually not perfect so we're gonna use
the Wanderlust eyeshadow palette and
this is New York City midnight Manhattan
makes sense or in New York yeah I use
that actually on my eyes today because I
have open you know I might be like a
similar like maybe we can do that
buttons a little bit I love to a nap
right perfect
I love these they're really really
creamy and blend roll which is super
important for eyeshadows each palette
has three different formulas in it
because I like three different finishes
I don't always want to wear Mike it's
like we have a tight mica glitter
cleanse up old school NARS world and
then we have this amazing new innovation
it's like a cream but it doesn't have to
be locked and air sealed but it just has
this amazing fleck in it so instead of
like a tape mica glitter it has like a
genuine almost like candy wrapper FLAC
it's really thick and creamy but not
greasy and not like a cream shadow and
then we have like a nice matte
traditional lightweight one so going in
with a blending brush and that same
purple and we're going to absolutely
bring down
I always loved like a lime green from
the I do you usually do like I'm the
lower yeah yeah yeah yeah I love that
too especially like with summer coming
mm-hmm you ever wear a brown mascara um
I've actually never tried in the 80s and
90s that's like what we were it was
natural and I think very friendly for
daytime so flattering and beautiful
we're gonna bring it back let's please
bring it back yeah I haven't tried it
okay the sound thing oh yeah yeah I hear
you Darren right and if I might y'all
it's so clear that it's Danny that I
can't does anyone else did anyone else
watch those totally Jonnie Jonnie right
all of my friends live in her world
everyone anything to distract us from
the world chaos and just talk about
something else for a minute it's so much
and positive may I say that the way you
do makeup is so gentle and yeah it's so
hard doing makeup from like the side so
I'm gonna I know I was you first I came
to just see like make sure it's and I
heard that you have three patents I
adopted three cat yeah yeah yes lucky
fern and Peach oh and Allah will take on
but every us I have four cats so I have
you beat by water do you live in no you
don't live in New York no no I live in
Jersey because I have the space we have
three cat 13 fishing two dogs I am that
like bananas house yeah the kids love
and the adults are looking at me like
you're crazy and I'm like next up I'm
using the light illusion perfecting
powder my fish are like really weird to
every time you walk by the change like
they're real PD you would think fish for
so I know these crazy
I actually can't make eye contact
sometimes no especially first thing in
the morning a little guilty I don't want
to see you yeah they like caffeine I
can't take your desperation stop putting
it on me I'm not kidding this is my life
I'm gonna go in with the light pollution
perfecting powder and the color stables
this is darker but we're gonna use that
for the nose contour he's gonna like set
the cream a little bit for the first
time I've ever contoured my nose so
we've expanded on that line yes as part
of it and it's this great technology
that they use to refine it yet so that's
a really beautiful quality and I'm
actually gonna use that same darker
shading I'm gonna add a little bronzer
as well on the magic three whoo your
skin is stunning what do you put on your
deck knowledge like the highlight yeah I
actually use the one from my palette
beautiful yeah you're like you're really
gonna sweater I'm like ready first I
know I look like a hot mess and I know
my are you good like the only skin I
show is my forearm I'm not hot so Glee I
show for our unlike that's about it now
this is me at like I don't know yeah and
then this is me through the years yeah
and then I'm gonna end up no like here
no it's now we're going in with the lash
warrior I always pride myself on how
still I can keep my eyes and was he not
doing my best with you I felt bad you do
know he's still is a mummy you know
you're good I swear I feel like I should
put on a different outfit for you I mean
maybe we don't need this mr. Rogers /
Alexander McQueen sweater and it's a
green sweater so oh my god you can't
look till the end of Nile the final
result I'm not I'm just saying I didn't
maybe just see my nose for a second I
had to do it double take I find it don't
use eyeliner on the face where I really
feel tired it can really bring out the
dark circles up and how yeah sometimes
it makes your eyes look smaller yeah be
open like with a nude or white liner on
the bottom too it'll kind of Dolce
Gabanna it says they have a great pinky
rose color it gets number six to the
back in fact check that only on the
inner waterline it really makes it pop
cuz it'll I'm it wasn't that it was like
this yes
it was more like that should be my stuff
you wanna try it yeah next I'm gonna
take the petal pout lip liner in beige
we're gonna use it as an eyeliner today
my kids are so close in age when they go
to grade school they're gonna be one
great apart oh that's so I was a magnet
at my daughter's first birthday oh my
god do you have any sister like siblings
our sister I never had siblings and it
bothers really so much like I only made
it last I had to my sister worked 2
years 8 months apart so like when we
were little like I wanted to be her best
friend here a twin and everything she
hated me but once I hit I think
middle school high school we became best
friends and she was like the best big
sister EVER so I best friend yeah we are
there the word sisters is the thing that
melts my heart more than anything in the
world
yeah do you see this shade it's a little
edible so this is from the Wanderlust ed
gets the Austin and I was trying to find
a nice color to highlight and got this
ridiculous
it's so pretty so we're gonna highlight
under your brows and on your nose not a
morning person at all
so I think that was like tell my fish
that they're so freaky at the morning
they're like look at me look at me look
at me look at me that's gonna keep
though like that the efficient dealings
- they do know who are like those are so
boring and like have you met mine it is
a very happy fish tank I won fish and it
was just making me so sad and so I was
like let's just like I called Tony the
Tiger it was like go and pick up like 12
fish on your way home that's like every
fish they have just grab them and we
plunked them all in together and then
the tank got really foggy really quick
and I called and they were like clearly
your tank is not big enough for 13 fish
so then I had to upgrade and now I look
like some Miami drug dealer with like a
giant aquarium deuce Bigalow yeah so I
actually use that same eyeshadow feel
like to highlight your cheeks of it a
little quick little hey I like that
you're using a different shade of the
perfect stick to contour I'm using the
highlighter as a palette that you're
using the lip liner inside the water in
there
that's what's so cool that make the
multi right tassel right here feeling
that's my favorite thing about this
tutorial other than your amazing company
and the gorgeous job you're doing that
I'm not
looking back I can tell it's beautiful
so I think we should do some lips if I
think we should do it together but I
kind of want you to look and like let me
know what you think can I look now
yeah and then if you want me to change
anything and marshmallow chimera yeah I
don't think we have like a little mirror
right oh we do my god this looks so
beautiful then you have to be honest you
know I if you're like okay like this
little I actually didn't have my I told
you I can't I don't act like yeah I
believe that that's so interesting I
don't wanna die like I've said like I
don't know how to act it before like we
don't want to care that it just sounds
self-deprecating and weird no I told I'm
like all right but I don't I can't fake
it yeah I really can't think any yeah no
I like that type and I mixed up soft
cabin I don't lie yeah I just can't know
I'm the same way I would know if I was
lying I'd be like dum dum dum this is so
stunning what he's into the notes is
like you look down you can see like oh
my god I love it yeah
this is so beautiful you're so you like
oh my god I love it oh my god it's so
beautiful you're so talented and you're
good without the eyeliner you think I'd
be like it without the inner yeah cuz I
think it keeps my eyes more open and I
need that right yeah
in fact I really love the pale pink on
that I do I'm gonna have to do that at
my beauty junkie week will you do it
with me yeah I would love to here also
here keep the share shares the show
it's what close to it
if your makeup is so beautiful
and then the loves it tones you use I'm
not kidding
I think can you just start highlighting
hi monster I'm sorry okay do your makeup
I feel like it also made me look younger
and sharper I keep catching myself and
being like oh my nose is so pronounced
beautiful lean very when I could not
stop wearing the little naked blush it
is naked blush
yeah this is a good nude yeah it's the
one that I like them all great mine has
been on for hours so let's react so this
is the petal pout and toffee toffee
do you mind what you're doing it not at
all I like it yeah hmm even like just
this if you like milled it in a little
bit you could just wear that as a lip
too okay so just go really light with it
I need a nude like a little bit of brown
I'm like a little bit of a pink too
that's what I always look forward to
because otherwise I feel like it looks
sick it's too late I
fleshie getting it yeah I don't like
that and that was like in when I was in
high school I'm sometimes what I used to
do in the 90s was if I wanted more
definition in my lip then I would take
the powder puff on really like the
whitest powder like a number one mmm and
I would pound it into the compact or the
loose powder and then go over the lip go
over the lip and then you had a very
fair nude lip that was soft but it still
gave you that like definitions
yeah you're all the good tricks laughs I
like it I want to try some you have all
the good tricks I have lived in your
nowhere trick but you have like the
classic model school you just you know
gave me my first newest contour what do
we think of this lip and love with this
I love it by the way speaking of flick
got great with it thank you should we do
like get one more layer of lip Oh like a
gloss like a darker or okay so maybe you
try one and I'll try one and we can kind
of see comparing your asked okay I'm
gonna do Coco rebel and this is the
holographic lipgloss at the galaxy glaze
in so like if I said it with a batter
sings oh yeah it's like me trying to
name the company feel that snakeskin a
farmer yeah I feel like I've never seen
a color like that either depending on
where the light hits you it either looks
gold bronze brown purple do you usually
use liner you don't really move it yeah
I'll take a liner I feel like for me
like the combo I did is like I would
wear this every day it's sexy love it oh
my god see I look like wow
really sexy black like not today oh
thanks
so what's with glosses like this like I
said if you apply it just like right
here and right in the center it makes
them like larger what's nice about this
lip gloss though is it isn't just the
shine there's all of this my beautiful
spot yeah you're like light catching
prismatic just deliciousness
like it your lips have like three layers
of dimension it's the kind I wanna be
yeah the glitter and then this beautiful
gel like gloss on top it's really
multi-layer than dynamic and I swear I
love the way this guy thinks but I agree
I can't stop store for you I'm in Jersey
so yeah I'm sorry other girls and
makeovers I don't like some lip gloss I
don't think I'm like why am I not going
to do that right now I need to do this
again yeah okay we're gonna do the
mix-and-match lip duo
I'm doing mine and red velvet and I'm
doing violet vixen okay I'm gonna start
with the yellow lipstick side yeah oh my
god even I wouldn't think like purple
Inyo like I would never wear a yellow
shirt like I'm gonna wear a bright
purple I think that's like the perfect
red yeah this I am a Larry there's my
own my favorite moments of the whole
afternoon dress with that lipstick yeah
it's so beautiful
okay I should we try the Gloucester we
try the gloss yeah I think it's not
sticky at all like creamy and it doesn't
juxtapose the color too much yeah mmm
your lips are so beautiful no matter
what I don't think they look so good
thank you I am really feeling this color
I really think that you need to wear
that dress in those lips with my sweat
hands - we might be the Queen's eyes
hmm so pretty I like it
- well yeah seriously that boat that car
it's so beautiful this is the final
results I couldn't be happier

certain points and then in the end I
think we're very similar yeah our sense
of humor style and things we like and I
just had the best time with you you know
