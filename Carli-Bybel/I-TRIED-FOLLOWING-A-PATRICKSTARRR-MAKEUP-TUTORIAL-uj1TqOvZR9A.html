in my head but I woke up with like a
huge bump my head yesterday can you guys
see we could totally see it it was a way
worse yesterday so I was wrestling with
my little cousin and I hit my head and I
woke up and it was like this huge welts
on my forehead and I was supposed to
film this video yesterday but I was like
oh this is just not gonna work because
this needs to go away
so please disregard the welt on my
forehead and I also got my eyebrows
micro bladed on Friday so they're
looking a little bit crazy right now cuz
they're healing and they're dark and
they're like a little red so a little
bit of a mess this morning but first and
foremost I wanted to say thank you guys
so much for six minutes I was live on
Instagram while I hit it and it was so
exciting I was with my little cousin my
aunt and it was just a really awesome
experience so I wanted to say thank you
guys so much I'm so unbelievably
grateful for all of you I'm just so
unbelievably blessed and thankful and
I'm announcing a big giveaway this week
so make sure to stay tuned for that
because you guys deserve it and it's
gonna be the biggest one I've ever done
yet so if you didn't already see the
title today I am going to be doing a
Patrick Starr makeup tutorial he is one
of my favorites on YouTube I have loved
him for so long and when I saw this
whole trend of videos going around I
knew I really wanted to do it and I was
torn between him or Nicki because
personally I love both of them so much
and I love how they do their makeup but
when I went on Patrick's channel and I
saw his full coverage makeup routine I
think it might be two years old at this
point I just remember being in awe like
how many layers of products and powder
he used and it still looks so flawless
so since that day I've honestly wanted
to try out that exact routine just to
see what it would look like on my skin
personally so today is finally the day
so I'm gonna pull up his video and I'm
gonna follow along with him as we go and
the products that he uses are not
cruelty free but I did have a lot of
them in my collection from a couple of
years ago so I just wanted to give a
heads up for anyone that is fully
cruelty free some of the products that
we think are not cruelty free so just
wanted to let you guys know all right so
let's watch this video hey guys it's
Patrick to welcome back to my channel so
today I have a full coverage foundation
routine it's been a while since I did
when the last thing that I did was super
old super genki genki calm but today
represents you this fall coverage sweet
face tutorial my skin looks very food I
do a lot of steps I cover everything
from foundation concealer powder priming
even shaving if you guys want to see
more make sure to subscribe alright you
guys so do we do my skin like this is
the before the after the before the
after the before the after so I'm gonna
skip past I've watched this video
multiple times but I must get past the
part where he does talk about the
shavings although I do shave my face and
if you guys want to see that video I'll
link it up here I'm gonna go right into
the foundation routine today I know he
says in this video that he uses the
Nivea post shave balm he doesn't show
him so I'll be using it but he said that
he didn't use it so I'm just going to
use it really quick because I do have it
this is the sensitive skin line this is
so old I remember when Nicky you
mentioned this and everyone looked crazy
over it it smells like a man but it
really does work I'm gonna I swear this
bump hurts so bad it was so much worse
yesterday but I swear I had a cancel my
plans I was was the hang out with my
best friend yesterday and I was like I
have a welt on my forehead I look like I
just got beat up or something now to the
fun part foundation yeah different
dishes that I love I let the air flash I
used this in the power of me video this
is my your
it and spray this mission ticket and
their Mexican War p.m. four to seven
brush and just apply this a nice yeah I
like to work with building layers I'd
like hold on cornet I have a similar
brush where I put it
I have similar brush this one is a sigma
and he's gonna be lettin it in that way
you're not getting a cakey face so this
is already the first layer of mine to
your air class provision in the color
500 with my Murphy and four to seven
brush
covering up that welt you still see it I
woke up and I was like really the one
time I've ever woken up with like a bump
on my face and I was at home at my
aunt's with my little cousin it's like
to go you can look it up and call a max
or they don't so what's that mean see
you have a cell ready to have a certain
day in store but I'm gonna take this one
man m-43 9 morphe brush I'm going to
apply this on my beard area you see that
I honestly don't have patience to color
correct I know it's the best thing to do
but for me personally I don't have time
internationally the orange color
correctors and whatnot this is so full
coverage it works for me I'm gonna work
my way up and then I'm going to just Pat
this iMac with pigmentation areas are
best on my cheeks I'm not gonna really
go under my eyes because that's for the
concealer as then I will take the
remaining that I'll just put it on my
moustache that should cover
and then most of it so this is what it
should look like with just the liquid
and the cream I'll pop in my contacts
and because this one I have a by I
didn't have this I like to just pack so
I get the fullest coverage ever like I
said before this tutorial is not for
everyone if you guys want to know how to
get a full cake base drive you only have
the color too and have no water means
we're a lot more than this but you guys
look around some plan because it's good
to get right here to on the inner corner
so you don't neglect any of the darkness
there and I'm just going to just pack
this you same just pad as most of the
lashing as I can and I'm just gonna
bring it down I'm gonna put some down
the nose above the lip damn that's a lot
of makeup and then on the chin put some
on right here on the forehead just to
give me that
rupaul you see I'm smiling like this
like when you see a friend you don't
like this and just make sure you just
allow your cheeks to guide you and I
don't really mind my foundation either
all the way back because I don't want my
face to look wider I want to concentrate
light on the center of my face which is
why a lot of mine doesn't look like his
because I have my concealer was too dark
so I'm taking my most favorite brush
ever I mentioned it's an aerosol on
video this is the more I'm gonna take my
to our foundation again and I like to
use this as a blender like I said before
it is so micronized like to spray it and
you see how I apply it on the outskirts
of the concealer I'm gonna blend it with
the morphine GT brush and I'm just
pouncing you see that I'm just bouncing
just
I just passed and this will allow me to
have a smooth transition sometimes it's
a hard to blend clean which is why I
like to add an extra layer of that spray
today I'm going up but that's just a
remaining problem now this is what you
call snatched okay I snatched my damn
face with cranes liquids and a little
bit of magic and a little bit of a flick
of the wrist
next immediately trying to make too many
facial expressions
I'm gonna take my ear spy Cody powder in
the product and I found a little powder
puff under my eyes because I don't like
to crews immediately because I don't
want to go in around the airplane that I
am using is a translucent extra coverage
I get so many questions on that I'm
gonna lick it down below to where you
can get it but I'll just take a powder
puff I like powder puffs do there
anything just gonna take this and really
press it on my cheeks by the way again
something so micronized will get me that
smooth effect the reason why I press any
powder a lot of people ask me why do you
big why do you look put that on it's
really gonna insure the longevity and
let me tell you bitch you can go
swimming with this whole partner why I
will slap some water on me you could not
stop me from looking fierce guys I'm
literally dipping this getting as much
part as I can and just you just bless
match yeah
you look amazing you're not crazy
so next for my brows even my eyelids are
full-coverage like hold on I'm still
doing the powder this is the part that I
was excited for I was like how pin1
there's so much powder and I'm serious
my eyebrows I want to touch the looser
healing how come one wears so much
powder you shall see so right now he's
carving out his brows with a foundation
which I would normally do but again I
just got my eyebrows micro bladed so
they're like still kind of sore so I
don't want to like put any crazy makeup
on them so I'm gonna skip over this step
rather pretty okay so he just did some
eye makeup off camera so I'm gonna
quickly do the same so I'm using
actually my original palette today
because I don't have a newer one up here
I'm using the purple shade the darker
mouth because it looks like he is like a
pretty mom eyeshadow on so I'm just
using a bigger brush to blend it all so
my palette will be gone I think in like
one month and I know we've been saying
it forever but it's literally almost
gone forever so if you guys didn't want
to pick it up from BH again it's gonna
once it sells out it's gone forever
which is so sad so I'm just applying the
second highlight shade right on to my
lid I'm gonna keep it pretty similar to
his when you use the darkest plum color
and apply that just right into the
crease I've never had this much powder
these in my life so I'm so curious to
see how it's gonna look my faith knew
Patrick I know you won't steer me wrong
powder literally everywhere so I'm gonna
go in with some liner by now it should
be cemented
sonofa method must should no loose
powder number three I'm going to take
this and that so I think he wiped it off
and then my mother chanel say every time
I go over this bump it's like no it's
another loose powder but this one has a
tint let's go take away the white cast
who I sweat so much and I am so Orly I
use a lot of powder if you are a
performer if you're under skater powders
we'll be waiting similar technique to
pounce in your face with a powder puff
and powder is the best for you if I want
like a more sheer do you see the pigment
on that throw moisture coverage I will
just buff it in but mainly on my cheeks
I like to just dab and the brush that
I'm using is the morphe 41 it's a big
fluffy brush on my forehead I like to
just brush it along because I have a lot
of expression I don't want to do later
one I'm gonna spray some setting spray
on my life because I need it so my skin
actually looks really good it doesn't
look dry doesn't look like too powdery
I'm gonna finish up like he did off
camera but I'll stay on because I know
so I didn't cream contour my nose like I
always do because he didn't so I'm gonna
go in with
a tapered blending brush and the color
princess cut from this palette I'm just
gonna come to her my nose a bit because
I don't feel seeing without it
so bronze up I'm gonna be using the
color angle the struggle is real
I tell ya look you can kind of not see
my bump anymore although it definitely
reflects some light but I really want to
like fill in my brows a little bit more
what I cans my highlight the nose I'm
gonna add a little bit of blush honestly
I was scared when it was like my face
look super super white but he knows what
he's doing
we're gonna do some mascara and I'm
going to apply that same purpley shade
under my eyes or bottom mascara I'm just
gonna apply a little bit of how to uh so
I don't smear it
ow lips sleep the color somewhere and
for highlighter same color and if you
guys have my newer palette this is the
bigger shade on the top left I believe
there's like two long shades it's the
one that's a little bit more peachy you
lookin champagne there's one gold among
champagne you never get which the
finished foundation routine I hope you
guys learned a lot of tips and tricks
this is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this video when you see all that
powder it's so intimidating especially
for someone with like kind of dry skin I
mean they're super oily I'm super dry
there's like no in-between for me but
I'm so excited that I tried out in this
