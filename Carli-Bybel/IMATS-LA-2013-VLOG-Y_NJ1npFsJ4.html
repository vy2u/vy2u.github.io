was praying that you and me might end up
together it's like wishing for rain as I
stand in the desert but I'm holding you
closer
hi everyone thank you for watching so
this past weekend I was in Los Angeles
for IMATS if you follow any other beauty
gurus online I'm sure you have heard
about this it was the International
makeup artists tradeshow and for me it
was my first time so it was amazing it
was such a crazy experience getting to
meet so many girls who follow my channel
and I mean I wanted to go last year and
I didn't get to make it out but this
year was so much fun and I honestly wish
I could go back besides meeting so many
amazing people and taking awesome
pictures there were people painted from
head-to-toe and crazy makeup and all
kinds of artsy things so from me just
walking around it was a really really
awesome experience what was really cool
is I got to meet Talia joy and makeup by
Camila which were two girls I hadn't met
yet that I loved from YouTube so for me
it was really cool and it was really
exciting and Camila I'm sorry but I had
the biggest girl crush on her and I
wanted to meet her forever and it was so
awesome meeting her she's the sweetest
girl ever and little Talia she is so
cute and so positive and it just meaning
her really brightened up my day so other
than that I got to hang out with Nicole
Barrera all day you're gonna probably
see her in most of my pictures because
we kind of walked around together the
whole time I honestly love that girl she
is amazing and we just clicked so well
so Nicole Arroyo if you're watching this
I love you girl
and yes I also got to see Steph again I
haven't seen her since Vegas loved her
from SML EXO and it was really cool with
Sam was DJing that Saturday night so
Steph Nicole Melissa from love Melissa
Michelle Sophia and who else was there
there was a couple other girls there I'm
completely going brain-dead right now
but it was really cool cuz we all got to
go out afterwards and see her DJ and
have
so it was a really really awesome
experience I just wanted to share with
you guys some pictures and some videos
for those who were maybe wondering what
it was like but didn't get to make it
out I just want to warn you
I brought Samantha with me my best
friend and I got a new camera if you
look at my blog I do have a post about
frequently asked questions and I do tell
you guys that I use the Nikon one but I
actually just got the new Canon 60d and
I love it I hope you lenses for it and I
didn't realize until after day one of
IMATS that I probably should have
brought the other lens so if some of the
videos are blurry or really really close
up it's not her fault and she's trying
to get used to the camera so keep in
mind and anyone in the New York area New
York I'm s it's coming I think in April
and I will be there 100% will be there
and I cannot wait to go so if you're
kind of borderline and trying to figure
out if you want to go I suggest to go
because I would love to meet you so I
hope you'll enjoy my video and I promise
a new tutorial this week so much love
something videos get to be like further
if I hold it back on anything and you
keep well my god that's awesome okay got
