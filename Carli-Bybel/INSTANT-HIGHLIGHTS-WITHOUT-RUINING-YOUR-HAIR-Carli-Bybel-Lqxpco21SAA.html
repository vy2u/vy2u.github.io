today's video I'm going to be showing
you how to highlight your hair without
using in Bleach without using any dye
and you can do it in as little as 5 to
10 minutes so I have two different
hairstyles I'm going to show you today
this is hairstyle 2 which has a little
bit of some red highlights in it and I
did a funky super messy fishtail braid
which I absolutely love and the other
look is just going to be some big curls
with a more caramel colored highlight so
I want to get this video up today
because this week only Bellamy is having
their biggest sale that they have only
once a year I have two different coats

just give you five dollars off any set
of extensions but for this week only you

package of cosmetics and hair stuff as
well as a hair hanger which is valued at

Hot Tools whether it's the curling iron
the straightener any of that stuff so my
codes will be listed below as well as
the links and I will also let you guys
know some of my favorite products from
the website that way you guys are in the
market or are interested you can go and
pick them up so if you guys want to see
how to get highlights with hair
extensions and please keep watching
whenever i've done this in the past I've
always curled my hair I'm not sure how
it looks straight but for today's look
I'm going to show you how it looks with
curly hair it just blends a little bit
better it looks more natural in my
opinion so you guys have seen me call my
hair million times so I'm just going to
curl it really quick so the next step is
to pick out your extensions I decided to
do two I'm going to show you guys
different looks I wanted to try like a
light brown highlight and then also like
a reddish highlight
I've never had red in my hair so I was
actually really curious to see what it
would look like so I wanted to try out
the two different colors these are the
Bellamy magnifica 24 inch set so this is
like the exact length of my hair now
which is perfect want to make sure
you're getting whatever size is good for
your hair the ones that I've always used
in the past um when my hair was shorter
were the Lily hair extensions and then
also the 22 inch Bellamy extensions but
now I've moved on to the 24 so I'm gonna
try to show you first I'm going to do
the brown first so this is color number
4 normally I was 1c but my hair is a
little bit darker than 1c so I'm not
sure which is the one shade darker than
that but that's like what color my hair
is right now so if you want like a more
natural highlight you can do just like 2
shades lighter or if you want to do
something a little bit more dramatic you
could do blonde or anything like that
it's just like a really fun easy way to
add highlights without having to bleach
your hair so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to curl a few of these pieces and
then I'm going to show you how I put
them in so you can see the difference
like my hair is almost black it's not
black for those of you guys wondering I
got dark brown but I came out a little
darker the last time that I did so it
almost looks black but it's not ok so
first I'm going to start with the three
clips and I'm just going to curl them
just like I curled mine I don't know if
you guys can see the bottom of my hair
but I kind of left it a little bit more
straight at the bottom to give it more
of like that wave instead of like two
two curls you can do it however you want
if you want it more like tight with more
curls or like even looser than this
totally up to you so now I want to
section off my hair I'm gonna start at
the bottom I'm just gonna pin all this
up if you want you can curl your hair as
you go with the extension so if you can
clip them in and then
curl your hair in with the extensions
it's really up to you but um today I
figured I would do it this way because
you guys have seen me from my hair like
100 times depending on your hair I never
do this because my hair is still coarse
and sick okay um but you can tease right
at the root so if you would want to do
that you would just take the hair and
then just backcomb up but I'm not going
to do that tonight because again my hair
is like so coarse up at the root so I am
just going to clip it in there honey
what are you doing and then when you
bring it to the front you can already
see the highlights yeah I love this
color the next piece is going to be the
next three so what I quickly wanted to
mention if your hair is shorter and you
want some more length and you want like
the extensions of your actual hair to
give you length and then add the
highlights what you would do is the
first clip you can add your natural hair
color extension just like I did and then
the second layer you can add in the
lighter color extension so again if you
want your hair to be longer but your
color and just adding and a few
highlights do that so your going to use
your natural color extensions and then
you're going to use a different color as
well so next I'm going to go like right
above my ears so I left about this much
hair in between and we're going to flip
the second layer of the three so again
if you are using regular extensions as
well this would be your first row of
highlights your first row of extension
would be the normal color of your hair
I've always been a fan of like bigger
highlights I've never
I really loved like the thin ones just
for myself because like for instance I
love being able to see the highlights
not just like a bunch of little tiny
ones I like like chunkier one so it
looks more like this maybe I'm gonna do
one row of four and then I'll do the
singles just because I feel like I need
to see more I guess I want to do one
layer four because if you see all of my
hair kind of covers the underneath
highlights I'm going to take the longer
one out of the two fours there's one
that's a little bit longer I'm going to
do that one so that way it wraps all the
way around my head I also didn't mention
if you guys want to just add highlights
to your natural hair and the extensions
maybe are a little bit too long I would
recommend clipping them in when your
hair is straight that way you can cut
them and make sure that they're the
right length and they're the same length
as your hair that way it's gonna look
the most natural and you can see it kind
of ends just like right there which is
enough and this will be for it like in
the back of your hair the little pieces
in the front are really all about your
own hair where you want them what you
want showing so you can see like in the
back you can see the brown but in the
front there's really not much of the
brown so you want to like clip up here
you want to make sure you're leaving
enough hair up here and then also if you
guys have like shorter angles or
whatever in the front you can also cut
these pieces you can um what I used to
do is I would put like a little bit of
like permanent marker on one of the
strings so I knew like which piece would
go where and go right here so I'm going
to leave that one there but I think the
one below it I'm going to move back just
a drop so I'm going to put this guy like
right over here
so I may actually add the other four
piece in just so you guys can maybe see
the highlights even more although I
really actually like how it's looking so
far and then curl in
I'm going to add the last piece in the
set because I realize my hair was so
thick I want to just be able to see the
highlights a little more so I'm going to
do this all the way up here
look now I'm McHugh look now I have your
colors orange caramel swirl
so I absolutely love how this color came
out I haven't done like state highlights
like this in probably like three and a
half years so I knew I was gonna love
these because I had done this in the
past but I feel like if the red is going
to be a cool little change so also if
you're wondering why I have a beautiful
band-aid on um on Saturday night we were
getting into the car and Brett like sat
on my nail kind of and it cracked like
right here all the way across to like
their nail is still on there because if
I take like the whole tip off my own ass
gonna come off so I might have this
band-aid for awhile so the next shade of
extensions are number 33 these are also
the magnificos which are 240 grams and
24 inches and an all Friday told you
guys up at 4 so these are going to stand
out a lot more you could see the
difference
ajan all my hair was this color
so the reason that it's a little
different obviously when you're wearing
your hair down is you want to make sure
you're placing them that way it's going
to show throughout your hair but for the
braids you can kind of like work with
the braids and pull out certain pieces
and make certain pieces show a little
more so I'm going to use the two threes
and then the two fours and then I'll
probably add like a few of the singles
just like up towards the top so three
clips and just clip them onto the back
of your hair I'm going to do right or
the ears are new the second three it's
such a contrast but I love this color
red it's like a more like a strawberry
type of color it's not like a bright
bright bright red so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to go ahead right to the
I can't use you um I'm going to go ahead
right to here and what I'm going to do
here and this is what I would normally
do if I was applying extensions I'll put
both fours right at this level so flip
up your hair and then grab one of the
fours the reason that I like to do this
is because if you were to just put it
like centered you would see there's like
all this space here that's going to be
left I'm going to apply that closer to
the ear on that side and then work it
around
and then the same thing on the side
start really close to this one and then
you'll overlap it so I'll show you so
what I'll do is I'll click the next clip
on to the extension and then just work
it around like that
so hard it wherever you want I like it a
little bit off to the side and we're
going to do a fishtail braid because I
feel like that would look super super
cool so you're going to bring your all
over your hair over to one side we're
going to split the hair into two
sections
my hair feels slick ridiculously no what
we're going to do is we're going to take
a piece from the left side and we're
going to cross it over to side - so this
is side wanna this I - then we're going
to take a piece from side - and then
cross it over
cross it over and put it into side one
and I'll just keep repeating side two
over one and when you first start out a
fishtail braid it feels like you're
doing all this work and you're like why
doesn't it look like anything but just
if you're patient with it eventually
you'll be like oh wow
I get it so get inside one we're
wrapping it over and bringing it into
ponytail two thing I always like to grab
some like underneath and then wrap over
that way it kind of like controls the
hair a little bit form it like wraps
around it and then it pulls it tighter
and wrap it over one and then tuck it
into two
it just takes again very long time when
you have this massive upper braid it's
going to take you bit longer but it
already looks so cool yay I always love
doing like blondes hair or likes just
some of the highlights because the
dimension of the hair just makes
everything look so much cooler so like
every braid every hairstyle curls they
just look so much better when there's
some dimension to it and you're just
gonna secure the bottom with an elastic
and then you want to kind of I don't
know what this Moochie would be call it
you just want to like fluff it out a
little bit I like my fishtail braids
like super messy and like textured
looking so once you're done you can just
start like pulling it apart like this
seeing where you need it thicker and
what parts you want to be like Messier
and then also you can bobby pin anywhere
that you're not loving so so I normally
like to like pull this out a little bit
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video hopefully
learned something new if you guys have
been in the market for extensions I
highly recommend bellamy if you guys
have been following me for a while I've
used them since day one and they're just
the best in my opinion so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video again check the
bottom bar for all of the info that I
talked about in this video thank you
guys so much for watching and until next
time I'll see you guys later
you can see like how this is kind of
lifted and that's just because that's my
like curly roots so that's why you want
to make sure you focus on the top that
way it flattens out
so I'm just going to like make sure
under here is super straight as well
right by the roots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
