to get to our hotel it was like an hour
and a half so we checked into our rooms
we unpacked a little bit threw ourselves
together and now we're heading out to
grab some food so what we're saying it's
all-inclusive which is awesome so we're
gonna try a bunch of the restaurants
here I think tonight we're going to just
try the one that's like the closest
because we're all so tired and super
hungry so of course I packed so many
outfits for dinner and they were like
leggings and a tank top
