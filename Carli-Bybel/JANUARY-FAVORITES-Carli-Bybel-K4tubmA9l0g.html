here today on this also lovely day it's
pouring out so I apologize if you can
hear the rain throughout this video but
I wanted to sit down and film again for
you guys today originally I planned on
filming my 2015 beauty favorites but
when I was going through myself trying
to find everything I wanted to find it's
kind of a lot harder than I had
anticipated
I have been organizing and unpacking the
past two days but everything is still
kind of all over the place so bear with
me guys let me know if you do still want
to see that video just maybe a little
bit later than expected but today I'm
going to sit down and talk about some of
my January favorites not only makeup I
have a lot of like skincare products as
well that I've been using a lot for the
past month so you guys want to hear what
some of them are please keep watching so
the first product that I want to talk
about is actually empty I just picked up
a new one yesterday it's by a brand
called derma e and it's called Sur
asthma Body Wash it's for people with
psoriasis and eczema and I use all this
up and I have noticed that it helps me a
little bit I think the main thing with
eczema or psoriasis is I think it's
something in your diet so a lot of
people tend to look for our products and
try and feel it on the outside when in
turn it's really something on the inside
I've been trying to figure out what has
been causing my eczema
I know sue she is one of the big causes
for me which thinks because sue she is
my favorite food ever I used to eat it
like three times a week so once I
stopped eating it I noticed that my
eczema cleared up a lot so unfortunately
I think I am either allergic or a
reaction to shrimp tuna
which are my three favorite so yang for
me so as I mentioned of course I do
think it comes from cleaning yourself
from the inside out but I do also think
that using products for the outer part
of your skin is important as well you
don't wanna use anything with fragrance
or anything that's gonna irritate it
even more so I found that this has been
working really really good for me so
this looks fun but it's actually empty
there's nothing left in it so yeah I
wanted to share this with you guys for
anyone who maybe has eczema or psoriasis
try it out let me know what you think
I've tried a million different products
and I think this is so far my favorite
body wash that I've had the next product
is actually a new product but I've used
it the past couple of days and it's so
beautiful it is the new Charlotte
Tilbury highlighter what is this thing
called bar of gold and it's literally
like a bar of gold
I thought it was gonna be a little bit
bigger from the picture but is pretty
mini but I actually love it it's such a
pretty gold bright highlighter I used
for my nose highlight today I use that
light pink shimmery shade from my Carly
Bible palette and then I put this on top
of it so this is super beautiful I
absolutely love it and I know I'll be
using a ton of it and the months to come
I have been using it a bunch of the past
couple of days so I wanted to mention
that as well the next product I want to
talk about is the Anasazi a Beverly
Hills brow gel I just purchased the new
one like two weeks ago because I use
mine up but this is definitely my
favorite brow gel I have a few other
brands but I just find that this the way
that the brushes it just really really
hold your brows in place whenever I'm
wearing my hair back or like slick I
always bring this with me as well
because it's like a little mini gel and
brush on the go so it has multiple
purposes for it and can also use it as
like a clear mascara if you want I don't
have anyone
I know when I was younger I used to wear
something that was scary but yeah so I
think there's a million different uses
out of it this is definitely my favorite
brow gel and I highly recommend it if
anyone is in the market for one next I
wanted to talk about these coach endo
wipes this is the second packet that I
have gone through I love these because
they're oil-free so we don't leave my
skin getting like greasy I know some of
the wipes I use afterwards I feel like
there's like a film over my face which I
hate so that's one of the main reasons
that I love these another reason is
they're really really soft and gentle
around your eyes so it's not like
pulling and it also doesn't leave like
that
sun sea feeling as well it's hard to
explain but I have another wipe that I
was using for a while but when I would
wipe underneath my eyes it was like a
soapy white I don't know how to explain
what it was but I just like these
because they're very very simple they're
not messy and they're really really soft
on your face if you guys are looking for
good wipes these are amazing and they're
all-natural which is also really cool
the next product I had literally changed
my life
ever since I got it I got this at Amy's
in LA it's the glyph Celine pirate
parrot oil anti-aging and deep puffing
it's vegan it's natural and it's organic
it's just like a little eye roller like
this and then you apply it underneath
your eyes and it gives you like a cool
tingly feeling and I absolutely love it
it is very expensive these little things
but I've heard amazing things about on
it so I haven't using this for the past
two or three weeks I will keep you guys
posted if I see any dramatic results or
anything from them but I actually love
how it feels on my eyes it's like really
really cool going on and you can use it
in the morning and the night
my next favorite of the month is the
hoola bronzer by benefit I've been using
this 108 ton it's a perfect matte
bronzer shade it goes really really good
when my skin is paler it's always hard
to find a good match shade when you have
a penile skin tone so I feel like this
is a really nice mixture between a warm
and a cooler bronzer it's not too warm
at some LED oranjee but it's not too
cool that's gonna be like too grayish so
I think it's a great mixture and I love
the creaminess of the product so this is
definitely my go-to bronzer at the
moment
again it's the hoola benefit bronzer so
next I have talked about this Lancome
mascara because you guys have seen me
use it a few times the past month I know
it's absolutely mind-blowing because I
said like the world will end the day
that I stopped using my L'Oreal
telescopic but I just really really
really love this I know this one's a lot
more pricey than the telescopic so if
you guys are on a budget
telescopic will always be one of my
all-time favorites but when I came
across this one I was actually very
pleasantly surprised
I loved how long it makes my natural
lashes so this is definitely my favorite
at the moment if anything changes I will
let me know but I just love this one and
I love the little brush on it you can
see it's like you could see it's like
not like a fluffy brush it's kind of a
mixture between like the telescopic type
of brush and I guess a fluffy brush but
I'm loving this it's not so crazy the
next part that I wanted to talk about is
from first day Beauty I have mentioned a
couple other products I love their
moisturizer and I actually just recently
tried their ultra Repair intensive lip
balm and I really really really love
this one I'm actually wearing it on my
lips right now some of the matte liquid
lipsticks that I use get really really
dry and they create that that line right
there
so I've just been using this one because
it's new and it's an out I also love the
best damn beauty lip mask by nicole
guerrero that's my other favorite
is actually in my drawer in my bathroom
so it might come on use that one and
then if I'm doing makeup write anything
this one's just out so I've been using
this one as well but I just love it
feeling a good lip balm is very very
important I'm not a huge fan of
chopsticks anymore I like the bombs
where you're going to like stick your
finger in it and then apply it because
it's a little bit thicker and I find
that it lasts a lot longer next I have
the ultra HD concealers my makeup
forever these are amazing I've been
using them literally every single time
I've done my makeup the colors that I've
been using are y23
r22 and why 33 for a darker yellow tone
is the why 33 and then these two are for
like a paler complexion one is more of a
yellow tone and the other one is more of
a pink tone so it's really just about
preference
they both will ends up looking basically
the same if you have darker circles I
recommend trying the one with a Pinker
tone because it's gonna help cover and
bring up your under eyes the next
product that I have is my benefit it's
called the Porefessional Agent Zero
shine and it's shine vanishing Pro
powder so this is just like a loose
setting powder I've been using this to
set underneath my eyes and I just
absolutely love this powder it's very
very fine and very soft so it goes on
really nicely and it doesn't leave
anything feeling cakey you can also use
this to set your entire face whether it
was a brush or a powder puff or anything
like that but this is just the powder
that I've been using a lot the past
month the next product is the surf spray
by bumble and bumble it's not the normal
star spray I always use the regular surf
spray this one is the surf infusion it's
oil and salt and you spray so it's not
gonna be as sticky as that salt spray it
has a little bit of
so it leaves your hair feeling a little
softer which is really nice and it
smells amazing I pick this one up from
Sephora again about a month ago and so
far so good I really love how the next
month I picked up about two or three
months ago I don't remember I think I
got it from Barney's it's actually a
deodorant it's by the grand melon and
goats or get some I don't know how to
pronounce it
it's the eucalyptus deodorant and it is
for women and men and it's an
all-natural deodorant no aluminum or no
toxic chemicals in them so this is the
only thing that I've been using and it
works so much better than the Tom's
uterine that I had mentioned in the
previous favourites video it's not that
I hate the Tom's but it kind of left my
underarms feeling a little bit wet when
they weren't so I was kind of in the
search for a new one and once I found
this one it's literally amazing the next
thing I wanted to mention are these
Schick Hydro silk raise your heads I've
been using this razor for polyak ear now
and you serve the heads I use because
it's for sensitive skin so I just wanted
to quickly mention means they aren't
really expensive but I've ever fir using
a regular razor over the disposables
just because again I have really
sensitive skin and I found that this
works a lot better for me I can use one
of these heads I like five or six times
in the shower so it is worth it in my
opinion if you want to spend a little
bit extra money but I just wanted to
share that for anyone who's in the
market for a good razor and the last
thing that I wanted to mention today is
this little device that I've been using
to blog I haven't bought them a little
bit but when I
and I wasn't able to film for you guys I
was vlogging a lot and I was using this
in my car it just suction cups to the
mirror and then your camera just hangs
it right here and then it's a perfect
steady way to hold your camera so I just
wanna share it with you guys I got this
from Amazon I think it was like 30 bucks
it was nothing crazy and this is
probably the best thing that I bought to
blog with so I wanted to share it for
anyone who is a globby there anyone
who's looking for some more steady
footage or there's really nothing more
annoying the shaky camera and hearing
that those little things on the side
make that noise so this thing I found
works amazing so I just wanted to share
that as well that's really it for my
January favorites I do plan on filming a
Valentine's Day app that I see a
lookbook for you guys I know a lot of
people were requesting that so be
patient with me I will duck that up for
Valentine's Day that way you guys can
get some inspiration I'm going to try
and film that for you guys tomorrow I
just want to get myself a little bit of
a spray tan purse because my legs are
super pasty so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I love you guys so much and
until next time I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
