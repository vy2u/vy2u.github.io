today's video I'm going to talk about
some of my current favorite products
it's been a really long time since I've
done a favorites video and I normally
don't like to do them monthly so I feel
like it's been a good enough time that I
have some products that have really
really been my favorite throughout the
summer so far so I figured I would show
you guys on my favorite cruelty free
products I got my nails on yesterday I
do like the color
they're like a light pink kind of like
it I feel like every time I go get my
nails on it - they're like beige pink
I don't know especially when I don't
have fake nails and it's just like my
natural nails they chip so easily so and
they grow out really easily so I'd be
like with lighter colors you don't
notice it as much but um alright so
let's get into today's video so the
first product that I wanted to talk
about today are these lashes these ones
are by red cherry they're the WSP lashes
there's also another brand made in the
same Factory they're called Christina
lashes and they also have a lash called
WSP so I actually have both of them and
I kind of swap they're basically exactly
the same you can get them right on
Amazon they come in like a six pack but
every single time I've done my makeup or
taking a picture the past about two
months I'm going to say I've been using
these lashes the reason that I love
these lashes is because every time I
wear them people are always like are
those your real lashes they're amazing
and I'm always like no they're fake but
they're really affordable and I'll
always tell them about where I got them
and everything like that but I love them
because they're just very natural
they're really lightweight they don't
feel heavy on your eyes and it basically
feels like you have nothing on you know
sometimes when you wear like the thicker
band lashes they feel a little bit heavy
and then they start poking these I never
ever have that problem so I wanted to
mention them because I've been obsessed
with them next up I have this pocha pore
perfecting water gel I've just been
using this as a moisturizer underneath
my makeup for the past two months I got
this in June like the beginning of June
so June July and then now it's August so
about two months I've been using this
and its really really moisturizing I
like it cuz it's not your typical
moisturizer it feels more of like a gel
and it feels really nice and cool on
your face so what I've been doing
morning before applying my makeup which
I haven't wearing makeup every single
morning but I'll wash my face and then I
will apply this and then I'll go right
in with my primer and then my makeup and
I found that my makeup has just been
looking really nice so for a while I was
noticing my skin was just not looking
good I think I talked to you guys about
it I was getting like a ton of breakouts
on my forehead on my chin and like on my
cheek on my neck like places that I
never really got it before and it
started happening before I got this
product but I actually went I had two
facials ever since and my skin has
cleared up immensely I think it's just a
mixture of like changing over from my
diet letting all the toxins out of my
body and yeah I guess probably just
basically more of what I'm eating so I
know for sure it's not this product at
first I was like I don't know if it's
this product but I've been using it a
lot the past couple of weeks and I've
noticed that my skin has still been
improving so it's definitely not this
product so I recommend this if you guys
are looking for a nice moisturizer to
apply in the daytime the next product is
by tarte it's the tarte East clay paint
liner in black this has been my go-to
liner for the past two months I was
using the Sigma in wicked it's like that
gel liner but I don't know if it's just
me I always make sure I put the caps on
right after I use it gel liners but they
always dry up so quickly and it's so
much harder to get like a really perfect
line that way I like this one because
it's in between a liquid and the gel
it's kind of like a mousse like a really
runny mousse if that makes sense I don't
know if that makes sense but it's just a
very nice consistency and I noticed that
my eyeliner comes out a million times
better which is always good because I
know eyeliner can be very very very
difficult believe me even though I've
been doing makeup for I don't even know
how long like it's still sometimes it's
a struggle for me but this eyeliner I
think makes it a lot easier in my
opinion so this is the one that I've
been using a lot and I really really
love next up I have this palette by
graftobian I'm not sure if they sell
individuals of this because I don't
really use a lot of the colors as you
can see but I've been using these two
dark colors or a cream contour on my
face and I don't do this during the day
it's usually for at night time or if I'm
doing a little bit more of a dramatic
look but whenever I sculpt out like my
cheeks and my forehead with these I just
noticed that my makeup stays perfect for
so long they're super super creamy there
drawing whatsoever I have a few other
products like for instance the la girl
Pro conceal that I used for my nose this
one gets super drying so I don't like
using this anywhere but my nose the
reason it's good for my nose is because
it will move anywhere like it's I put it
on my nose and I blend it out like it
stays all day but for these are just
like a million times more pigmented
they're super creamy really easy to
blend and I just think it looks really
great underneath so this pad has
definitely been my go-to as far as space
I have also used like some of the
lighter colors to kind of blend the dark
brown into like the foundation shade
color but I wanted to mention this
because I had bought this probably like
maybe like six seven months ago and I
didn't use it for a while but I was
using the LA girl and I noticed
sometimes it would look a little chalky
especially around my cheeks so I've been
using this and I'm absolutely obsessed
next up I have the Aztec
secret Indian healing clay I got this
off of Amazon I have seen you guys
recommend this a while ago I actually
bought this on Amazon I'm gonna say
probably like six seven months ago and
again it was one of those products I
just didn't use right away but about two
three months ago when I was posting
about how my skin was getting really
really bad I saw a lot of people
recommending it again so I found it in a
box that I had an unpacked from when we
moved and I took it out and I used it
and I absolutely loved it so this is
like a powder unlike most masks you make
your own and you mix in apple cider
vinegar with it so it has the directions
on it equal parts of raw apple cider
vinegar and water so I personally love
apple cider vinegar the reason that I
have been really into apple cider
vinegar is because I've seen so many
people saying has helped their eczema a
lot to be honest I've used it and it's
dude that for a short period of time it
didn't heal it obviously but when I saw
that that's what you had to mix in with
this I was really really excited to try
it and I really loved the mask it made
my skin feels so nice afterwards and I
felt like just cleared a lot of my
blackheads out so I know there's like a
million different face masks on the
market
and I've just never been like a huge fan
of masks I feel like a lot of them say
they do things and they really don't but
I feel like with this one I did notice a
big difference where normally I would do
a regular mask like I never really
noticed a big difference so I've used
this about three or four times so far
over the summer and I really really love
the result again you can get this right
on Amazon I'm not sure exactly how much
it is but I believe it's way more
affordable than some of those like $89
face masks next up I have these cover FX
custom enhancer drops these are
literally life like they're unbelievable
I've mixed these in with my foundations
I've used them as highlighters I've used
them on my eyes you can add them into
like a lipstick or lipgloss give you
like a metallic lip but these are just
so pigmented I'm going to show you guys
a close-up swatch of them so you could
see them but the two that I love are
moonlight and sunlight one is more of
like a pink undertone and one's more
like a gold undertone but they're so
gorgeous like do you see these swatches
right now do you see how pigmented they
are they're literally life in a jar and
I feel like I'll never ever use this up
I don't know how long they say they're
good for oh it says it's good for 12
months I don't really follow that I like
to just use stuff until it's empty but I
feel like this will last me for life I
think they should have made these in a
smaller jar so they were a little less
expensive and the again you're like
whoever I'm going to use this many drops
but I love them I'm a makeup freak and
you know I like to try anything shimmery
so I've really really been loving these
next up I have the Becca aqua luminous
perfecting foundation this is in the
color medium this has been the
foundation that I've been using for the
past two or three months so I got this
in a press kit it came like every color
and normally when I get press kits like
that I'm like a makeup collector like I
love having a full collection so
sometimes I'll never use anything in the
collection which isn't good but this
time around I was like you know what I
need a really good cruelty free
foundation I haven't found one so I
whipped this one out and it's just so
amazing it has um like a little dropper
so you push down and then it drops out
like that love the coverage it's a
really really great color so I've been
using this every
I've done my makeup the past two or
three months next up I have the Mai
Tai's spritzer by Drybar and this is
like a sea salt spray this is one of my
favorites I'm almost done with this um I
feel like it's such a small bottle I
need to make these bottles bigger
certain things need to be bigger some
things need to be smaller but whatever
um I love this one I use that today for
like my beachy waves I only apply a
little bit because if you apply too much
it gets kind of sticky I just like
adding a little bit into my hair and it
gives you like that really beachy
tousled look so this is definitely my
favorite hair product at the moment and
I'm doing like really pretty curls I'll
use more of like a hair spray I will
stick with this one because again it
gives you like that messy beachy look
but this I absolutely love I love the
smell of it this I got from Sephora I'm
not sure if it comes in other sizes I
believe I've tried like a sample version
of this before I bought the full one but
in my opinion this is worth every single
penny so next I wanted to talk about
concealer you guys probably know that
the NARS custard has been my favorite of
all time but I recently picked up the I
think this is a new shade I don't think
they've had this for a while but it's
called ginger so it's like a little bit
darker than the custard you see I feel
like with this camera it's like
old-school me like holding up products
waiting for it to be in focus but um I
love using the darker one because when
my skin's a little bit darker I always
notice using the custard it was just a
little bit too light and then I would
always have like that very very light
under-eye which I used to really love
but I feel like now I like it when my
skin's more like close to being one
color so the ginger has been my most
used concealer hands-down the past two
three months but I have like a little
bit of a tan I'm not that tan but we're
leaving for Jamaica in one week one week
not looking what's today Wednesday so we
leave on the 13th which is next Saturday
which is so crazy um we're going with my
best friend Nicole and her boyfriend me
and her used to go on family vacations
together all the time the last time you
know I've actually been on a vacation
together was probably freshman year of
high school so we were probably like 15
years old and now we're 25 so ten years
ago absolutely crazy
we were their parents so we're really
really excited we're going somewhere
all-inclusive so it's gonna be really
nice the next product I've been using
for the past two months as well I picked
this up from Harmon I believe it's the
strip lash adhesive it has aloe in it
and it's like super super black its
eyelash glue so the other eyelash glue
that I was using is like almost like a
dark charcoal gray color but this one is
like pure black which is really nice so
when you put it on if it gets on your
eyeliner a little bit like you will not
see it at all so this I've been using a
ton just to have to be careful with it
sometimes like a lot comes out like
really quickly so I just very very
lightly squeeze it but I've been using
this for the past two months wanted to
mention it for you guys because I prefer
using like a darker glue just because I
feel like you don't see that white as
much like I remember I used to only use
a white glue and then whenever I looked
down you would always see like a little
bit of like a whitish look in between
like your eyelashes and your liner so
when I found this one and realized how
black it was I was like okay this is my
new glue and I wanted to just tell you
guys about it and has aloe in it so I
know eyelash glue is probably not the
best for you but the fact that I have
aloe in it just made me like feel like a
little bit better about it so next I
have the african black soap body lotion
I tried a sample of this before I bought
this big one and I fell in love with it
I saw a lot of people recommending the
african black soap for eczema for
troubled skin so I bought the body wash
as well which I just used last night for
the first time so I don't know how I
feel about it yet I absolutely love the
smell of it though it smells amazing my
eczema has been literally out of control
which is so depressing I was starting to
talk to you guys about it in my last
video and then all that crazy stuff
happened so when we went vegan in April
I was so excited to hopefully have my
eczema clear up I had heard a lot of
people that had healed their eczema from
going vegan and switching their diet and
everything like that and although we
have one vegan 100% with our diet we
haven't been eating like only amazing
fruits and veggies and stuff like that
like we still have our pizzas like diet
pizzas or we have the amy's pizzas with
no cheese we still have like been
burgers and we have like vegan cookies
and stuff like that so we're still
eating like junk food so I'm wondering
if it's the junk food that's been making
it worse or if it's the new kitty that's
making it worse so when I first got
there and Scindia had told you guys how
my whole entire life like I've been so
allergic to every single animal dogs
cats horses literally every single
animal I've ever come in contact with so
when I found bear in Cindy and I wasn't
a chi
I was blown away and I felt like I just
had to take them both because I mean
what are the chances I was just
convinced that I was never going to have
a pet in my life so I think from being
around barren Cindy for almost a year
now my immunity has definitely grown um
when my sister first got her two kitties
she adopted them and was in two three
minutes of me being there I was sneezing
itchy watery eyes like I had Ali like I
couldn't even stay there and now when
I'm around her cats I'm not a hundred
percent okay but I'm so much better than
I was so I really really believe that
I've grown like an immunity to them so
when we found Bo in the beginning of
July it didn't even cross my mind like
that we wouldn't take him home I just
was like okay this little baby needs a
home we already have two what's one more
since he is still a baby and we're not
exactly sure how old he is my vet said
we had to keep him separated just god
forbid he has leukemia he's getting his
third round a shot and another blood
work test in like two or three weeks
that way we can know for sure everything
and then we'll let him out and all that
stuff but ever since we didn't get him I
don't know if it's him I still love him
he's not going anywhere we're gonna keep
him no matter what but ever since we did
get him I started getting eczema in
places that I've never had it before so
I've had like certain areas that I've
just continuously had it for at least
like 10-15 years like little bits here
and there and then I noticed once after
we got Bo I started getting eczema on
the front of my neck on my chest on the
back of my neck all over my stomach like
literally all over my stomach all over
my back other parts of my legs like I
used to only get it in like one spot on
my leg once one on my arm like little
spots here and there and now it's just
literally everywhere so I would say
about 80% of the time I'm just
like it's so hard for me to be happy all
the time like I used to be because I'm
just always so itchy and like even me
getting ready today like it's just so
it's so bad anyone who has eczema you
know how bad it is and I've been
watching this new show um the night of
and the main guy the lawyer and the show
has eczema and he goes to like an eczema
support group and literally when I was
watching that I was like I feel like I
need that I feel like we as eczema
sufferers needs like a support group
that we can all go to and just like
bitch about how all of our
dermatologists tell us tell us these
stupid things that don't work and have
us buy all these products that don't
work and nothing nothing works I just
feel like no one knows what causes it I
feel like there's so many different
types of eczema and I really felt like
by changing my diet it would help me so
I'm thinking about trying to be like
very very very strict on my diet and
just only eating like real raw organic
foods which is gonna be really hard for
me because I think the reason it was so
easy for us to transition over to the
vegan diet was because we found so many
amazing alternatives to what we used to
eat for instance vegan pizza which is
incredible veggie burgers which are
incredible we found um all kinds of
stuff that has just been so good so it's
been really really easy in that sense
but so I don't know if it's the cat I
think it's also soy maybe I have a soy
allergy because I noticed whenever I
have anything with sowing it it gets
really really bad so I know been talking
about this forever and some of you guys
are doing it back to my apply like just
shut up already but anyone who does like
my I promise you my mission in life is
to figure out how to cure eczema because
I will figure it out and I want to share
it with you guys because it's just such
a struggle and it's so hard to be happy
all the time when you're just like so
miserable like itching yourself and the
worst thing you can do is eat it but it
just thinks because I
always had really like soft like nice
skin and now I'm just getting like red
bumps everywhere and oh it's just so
frustrating but I mean this is life
again I'm gonna do my best to find out
what's causing it and yeah so I've heard
about the african black soap from you
guys saying that it's supposed to help
the eczema
I bought a sample version and I really
loved how it smelled and I really just
like loved it so I bought a big bottle
of it and I will keep you guys posted as
far as the body wash the lotion but
again I feel like no matter what product
you buy it's never ever going to help it
I mean it may comment a little bit but
it's never going to cure it so again my
mission is to figure out what's causing
my eczema and although everyone's
different I feel like if I can pinpoint
it and like try and clear it myself that
would just make me so happy knowing that
like hey I can clear it for myself and
be that I can share it with you guys
because I know a lot of people suffer
with this and it's embarrassing like
especially in certain areas like I go
get my pedicure and I have like these
bumps on my legs and they're probably
like what kind of diseases she had like
is it contagious like that's what I
always think about it people things like
contagious which no it's not contagious
but it's just very frustrating so is
that it for my favorites um no I
actually I'll just show you this because
it's up here even though it's not a
beauty favorite but these or gain vegan
shakes they are incredible we used to
buy them at Whole Foods and they were
like 35 40 dollars for a case I found
them on Amazon for like half the price
so we water likes three cases of them at
a time they're just really really
amazing I like adding them into my
smoothies in the morning I like adding
them into my coffee I like drinking I'm
just plain there have been a sweet
vanilla bean flavor there dairy free soy
free and gluten free which is always
great because I've been starting to only
buy things soy free because I really
feel like soy has been a big problem for
my skin as well but I really really love
these they have so many amazing things
in them for you and even if you're not
vegan or even if you're not like not
interested in that and you're just
looking for like a good protein shake
this one's amazing so I wanted to
recommend it since it's sitting right
here next to me but I think that's
really it for now as far as my July
favorites
I was gonna say like June July favorites

Friday with a Friday they finished in my
