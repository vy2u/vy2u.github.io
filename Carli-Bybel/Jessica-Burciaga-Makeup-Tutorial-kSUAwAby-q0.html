for watching in this tutorial I'm going
to be showing you how i got this makeup
look it's inspired by my favorite person
in the world who is Jessica Burciaga and
she's a famous model I don't know if you
guys know who she is but if you don't
I'm gonna put the link to her website
below and I suggest you go check her out
because you will be soap so sit there
like me because she's probably one of
the most beautiful girls in the entire
world she had posted a picture from her
photoshoot and I loved her makeup so I'm
gonna be recreating her look in this
video so if you liked it please keep
watching in Jessica Burciaga if you are
watching this I love you seriously
obsessed
first I'm going to be taking my Sonia
Kashuk concealer quad and applying it
all over my entire eyelid then using my
ELF palette I'm going to be taking this
light silver color and also a Mac shader
brush and apply this all over my entire
eyelid
next taking this pearly white color I'm
going to be applying this over the
silver shadow I'm also going to be
applying this color underneath my brow
bone using my Mac blending brush and his
dark silver shadow I'm then going to be
applying this right into the crease of
my eye
taking an angled brush I'm going back to
my ELF palette and I'm taking a dark
black color and I'm going to be applying
this on the outer part of my eyelid I'm
using this kind of brush that way I can
shape my eye and I want it to be perfect
I'm gonna be going back to my blending
brush to blend in and afterwards
now going back to my Mac blending brush
and this black color in my elf palette
I'm going to be blending in where I had
just done on my eyeshadow and blending
it upwards into my eye if you want to
use a straight edge this will help
prevent any black shadow getting onto
your face and it'll also give you a
perfect line
going back to the same angled brush I'm
then going to be lining my lower lash
line with the same black color from my
ELF palette
taking my Bobby Brown gel liner I'm then
going to be lining my upper lash line
when doing this you're going to want to
wing out your eyeliner on the end and
also in the inner part of your eye
you're going to want to drag it tests
will give you that sexy to a little bit
Jessica Burciaga has
you're then gonna want to use your
mascara I'm using L'Oreal telescopic
mascara and black and it's my absolute
favorite mascara I'm then taking my
lipliner it's by Jordana cosmetics and
I'm going to be outlining my lips
in this look she has a very natural lip
color so I'm just going to be taking a
little bit of concealer and dabbing it
onto my lips and then I'm going to top
it off with a clear gloss to give it
some shine
one thing that Jessica Burciaga always
has is a nice glow to her so I'm going
to be taking this matte bronzer with a
little bit of shimmer in it and applying
it right on my cheekbones also around my
forehead and on the sides of my nose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
