gluing down my eyebrows this may seem a
little bit weird but since Jessica
Rabbit is a cartoon and she has a really
high arched eyebrows I figured this
would be the best option so I'm just
using a glue stick I had only done this
one other time and it was actually on a
client a few years back so I figured
this would be a cool option you're just
going to apply it right over your hairs
and make sure that they're all stuck
down that way we can cover it with some
foundation and then reapply our brows
next I'm grabbing some banana powder on
my finger and just applying it right
over the glue
next up I'm grabbing this NYX foundation
stick and I'm applying that over my brow
and this is going to be a little bit of
a process but we're gonna try and make
our eyebrows as invisible as possible
then I'm grabbing Milani shadow eyes and
I'm applying that over the foundation
and again it's gonna look a little bit
cakey but from far away it looks a lot
better
so I originally created my fake brow
with a dark brown shade and I really
hated how it looked it kind of just
didn't look like Jessica Rabbit so don't
mind the high brows for half of this
video once I finished my eyes I go back
and actually fix my brows and make them
look a little bit more natural and more
of a reddish shade so again please
disregard the eyebrows for half of this
video because they look a bit scary
right now so I just primed my eyes and
now I'm moving on to the color naked
which is a Mac pigment and I'm applying
this right on the inner corner of my eye
I'm first dipping my brush into the fix+
and then I'm picking up this purple
shade and I'm going to start applying
the purple shadow you want to apply it
on the outer half of your eye and then
with a smaller brush you're gonna start
shaping the eye she has a very round
look so I'm going to take this brush and
just kind of form the round look to try
make it look as much like hers as
possible this is a little bit hard to
explain so I do apologize but I'm
keeping it in regular motion so you guys
can follow along with it but you're just
basically creating a half circle around
your eyes using that same purple color
I'm then going to start filling in the
outer half
you
grabbing my pencil brush I'm applying a
little bit more of that purple shadow
and then I'm going to slowly start
blending it into that naked shade that I
applied on my lid just to give it a nice
blended look
next up I'm applying my eyeliner I'm
just using the color wicked by Sigma
look at those brows whew
I'm dragging it out in my inner corner
and then I'm also taking the same color
and applying it under my eyes then
picking up this black matte shade from
Sigma I'm applying that in the outer V
of my eye with this pencil brush then
grabbing a little bit of this pink color
I'm going to slowly drag it into the eye
to give it a nice blended look
so as you can see this look requires a
lot of blending a lot of adding more
color and then blending it in
taking a little bit of that black shade
with my pencil brush I'm then going to
blend out the bottom line then I'm
applying a black eyeliner in the inner
lash line for lashes I'm using the demi
wispies by Ardell
okay so finally I am erasing these
horrid brows and I'm going to redo them
with a red eye brow pencil so I'm just
using a makeup wipe to wipe them off and
I'm using this color
Auburn eyebrow pencil and I'm going to
slowly start drawing some brows that
look a little bit more like hers
before I started filming I did apply my
foundation all over my face I use the
Chanel as usual and moving on to
contouring my nose I'm using the lighter
brown shade from my whitening lightening
brow bar
highlight I'm using light boost by Mac
and I'm just applying that in all the
areas that I want to highlight and I'm
using my Beauty Blender to blend it all
in
you
to contour I'm using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour palette and I'm
just doing a light contour for this look
because in the pictures it looks like
she basically has just a lighter
complexion and not too much contour
going on
and to set my concealer and highlighter
I'm using the colored banana from the
same palette
you
moving on to lips I'm using two lip
liners I'm gonna start off with the
Jordana lip liner to line my lips take
darker red shade and the reason I wanted
to use the darker shade first is because
I want to give it almost an ombre look
she has really big red lips so I'm over
drawing my lips a bunch and then
applying my lipstick this one is
fire-engine by Gerard cosmetics once
I've applied the lipstick I'm taking
that lighter red pencil and I'm just
going to blend it in and for gloss I'm
using the color candy apple also by
Gerard cosmetics I do have a special who
are the lipstick a lip gloss and a brow
bar for only $40 and free shipping so I
will list that below in the description
box
moving on to highlight I'm using the
color opal by Becca and I'm applying
this right on my cheekbones also on the
bridge of my nose
okay so now I'm moving on to the wig
since I didn't show you guys how to
apply a wig in my last video I figured I
would just show you guys what I do it's
really simple I just like to spray the
front back and then twist it into a bun
I don't actually put a hair tie or
anything in it I just have it in a nice
loose bun since my hair is super long we
don't want it in bulges so as you can
see I'm just twisting it around then I'm
taking my wig cap and I'm just applying
that on my head
once you have the weight cap on make
sure to tuck in any loose hairs and then
you're all set to put the wig on
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video it's definitely
a super dramatic look and it might be a
little bit too much for some of you but
I really wanted to try it out if any of
you guys are being just grab it and
recreate my look I would love to see it
so please hashtag me I hope you guys all
have an amazing safe Halloween and until
next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
