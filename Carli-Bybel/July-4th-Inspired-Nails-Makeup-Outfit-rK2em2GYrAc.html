hi everybody thank you for watching as
you could already see by the title this
video is inspired by July 4th which is
coming up any day now I wanted to do
something a little bit different than
maybe the typical July 4th look I know a
lot of you guys including myself most
likely will be attending some sort of
barbecue or something during the day so
if that is the case I mean I would
normally probably just wear like a BB
cream fill in my brows a bit maybe a
little mascara and that's really it but
I didn't want to just do that for this
tutorial because I felt like it would be
a little bit boring so I am doing a more
glamorous look I wanted to incorporate
red lips also I just got my hair dyed it
doesn't really look much different but I
just got it dyed a little bit darker
with some lighter pieces just thrown in
so if any of you guys are located in New
York I will list the info on where I
went for the salon and all that good
stuff so if you guys want to learn how
to get this look please keep watching to
start off this look I'm going to be
painting my nails first I'm picking up
this red OPI color and I am applying it
on my thumb and also my pointer finger
next up I'm using this white color by
Essie and I'm applying it right on my
ring finger then grabbing this gold
color from sinful colors I'm going to be
applying this right on my pinky and for
the blue color I'm using this one by
Essie and this is going to go right on
my middle finger I'm going to apply two
coats of each color as well when I sat
down I wasn't really sure what kind of
design I was going to do I feel like
that's how it always is for me but I
decided to add some glitter so I'm going
to add some of this red glitter polish
it wasn't as glittery as I like so I'm
applying some of this craft glitter
right on top and for the white glitter
I'm going to do the same thing this OPI
polish unfortunately is not as sparkly
as it looks so I'm applying some white
loose glitter on top of it as well then
picking up my I heart nail art pen I'm
drawing polka dots right onto my blue
fingernail I was
originally going to do stars but I
figured that would just take way too
long and who knows what it would even
look like so polka dots are always a
safe easy choice and to top it all off
I'm using a clear coat that dries
instantly and voila
those are my July 4th inspired nails
they're super sparkly and I really love
how they came out now let's move on to
makeup first I'm going to be applying
this white highlight color from Mac for
my eyeshadow base it's a cream
consistency so that's why I decided to
use that any concealer would be fine as
well from my take me to Brazil palette
I'm picking up this white shimmer color
and I'm applying it all over my eyelid
as well as underneath my brow picking up
this light brown matte shade I'm then
blending this right into my crease
picking up this darker brown matte color
I'm then very lightly blending it right
into my crease and blending it up into
that lighter beige color then taking
this blue eyeliner from Kiko cosmetics
I'm then going to be lining right under
my lower lash line I'm also using this
pencil to line in my inner lower lash
line from that same BH palette I'm
picking up these two blue colors with my
pencil brush and I'm smudging underneath
that line making it a little bit thicker
and giving it a nice blended look
I'm then lining my eyes with a black gel
liner as usual
next I'm applying false lashes I just
cut them in half so I'm just applying
them on the outer part of my eye and I'm
applying my mascara as I normally would
for bronzer I'm using this new one by
Laura Mercier and it gives you a really
pretty golden bronze color and for blush
I'm using this one by Tarte and I'm just
applying this right on the apples of my
cheeks
her lip liner I'm using the color cherry
pie by Milani and be careful when you're
using a red lip liner because if you
mess up it's really hard to get off your
face
or lipstick I'm using this bright red
color by the age
and it finishes look off I'm using this
Mac red lip gloss
so this is the final look I'm going to
be showing you guys a couple pictures
