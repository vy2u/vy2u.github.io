p.m. we have our painters here we have
them here yesterday too
figured I would just get some vlog
footage in because there's a lot going
on and I'm not sure if I would be able
to get two tutorials up as planned so I
figured since you guys are kind of like
in these vlogs maybe I can get one up
again before we go to LA we leave for LA
next Tuesday were going with Nicole and
Jeremy so the first time we've been back
in our apartment where me and Brett have
been back since August so it'll be fun
we wanted a couple rooms painted we have
a living room and a dining room that we
wanted painted one room was like a dark
red one was like a dark grey and they
painted the dining room and the color
that I picked out like I didn't like it
after they already had done it so he did
the dining room and I had picked up the
color and I thought it was gonna be
perfect but this was my first time ever
picking out paint and putting it up on a
wall so it's so crazy because the little
swatches they look so different on the
swatch than they do on the wall so I
felt really bad but I did not like the
color so I went this more really early
this morning and we got a couple
different samples so he's gonna buy a
few sample colors for the dining room
and then like I guess watch them on the
wall that way I can kind of see them
it's so weird I have this holiday gift
from benefit and there's like something
in there where if you push it it starts
talking and it keeps going off
oh my little boys getting so big who's
so big who's hoping who so who's oh I'm
so big hmm I might start from because we
have the doors all open downstairs
because the paint we don't want that
smell so that's why my scarf on by the
way oh boy and I'm so cute
hi guys so I just finished filming my
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A my camera died and I can't
find the charger so I had to finish off
with my vlogging camera but I wanted to
just say hi I was vlogging I think it
was two days ago and my camera actually
died I had to buy a new one again and
yeah so it sucks because I would love to
recommend this camera you guys cuz I
absolutely love it but I've gone through
literally four of them or maybe even
five at this point and it's just not
necessary like you keep it in and after
a few months it breaks so I don't
understand it's very frustrating but um
I'm going to edit this video for you
guys and then I'm gonna get that up
tonight tomorrow what am i doing
tomorrow I'm not sure what I have
planned tomorrow during the day maybe
I'll tell him another video but you guys
need to let me know what you want to see
because all of my ideas disappeared so
I'm probably gonna film tomorrow and
then we have my uncle's birthday so
we're gonna go there for some cake so
I'll probably bring my blog camera so
you guys can see the little babies and
they're not little babies anymore
Brookes seven we had the painter here
all week so that's what kind of held me
up filming um he's almost all done which
is really exciting I can't wait til it's
all done the smell has been killing me
so yeah I think that's it for now I'm
gonna go edit because it's time I love
you guys good morning guys it's 11:45 we
are on our way to the mall so these are
my pajamas
I love them so much that he said that he
thinks that I should wear I'm a public
so I'm wearing them in public today I
just smashed it even more so this
morning I smashed my phone I don't know
if you can see it dropped I had a little
crack on it probably for about four
months now so I was just waiting for the
day for this to happen to order a new
one
and I was getting ready and I was on my
way out of my beauty room and it fell
right on the tile and I picked it out
this that's what it looks like so I
called for a new replacement and now we
are pulling up at the mall and that I
just cut off friend so so we just Park I
want you to to understand the situation
better and realize you don't have to say
the things you say but why are you even
still I can have extra no all you need
to say is so today is a pretty hectic
day we got the painter at the house I
need you to grab a few things but right
now we're stopped at the mall run a few
errands so we just pulled up to the mall
we have the painter at our house early
this morning we're gonna run some
errands but first stop the mall we're
gonna run your son honey
this are cute just go catch Riley's mom
because now you know y'all so cut yeah
Oh first step is the balls cuz we go to
the mall so we had a really busy week in

Outfitters would you want it probably
not gonna go tomorrow and I'm really
want is not definite she said she's not
sure would you want to grab a drink
later
I think I'm up by asking me Atlanta oh
yeah of course they are going to do we
can do anything with them tonight I
would what dinner with them if they want
first birthday instead of coming
tomorrow or something yeah just cuz I'll
bug that's why I wanted to go tonight
tell her
those damn you know the stealer guys a
tough matchup so again all our work on
is backing myself or even what she
prefer a good film I think I think it
reeks of desperation yeah now I get
thinking of God you asked me where the
patient right in a sense another lips
are very overt um should we get through
not optimistic about when you're still
editing there Cindy boo Oh sweetie
is fun
you see
see the piece wasn't gonna lay before
you
this is our dining room we got it
painted this light gray I have to
obviously put pictures in the picture
frames but this is what I got going so
far not much but you know coming
together that's from the rug that I got
in the kitchen I'll show you guys that
in a minute but the color on the walls
is Sherwin Williams March wind the
reason I picked it is because March
hello right birthdays in March
are you doing
pushy crack hi guys so it is Friday
around 7:30 me and Brett are gonna go
grab a dinner and then we are meeting my
aunt and uncle it's my uncle's birthday
it was his birthday yesterday so we're
gonna go take them out for some drinks
so that should be fun the painter is
almost all finished we got all the rooms
painted except for one so I'm really
excited it's starting to look really
really really nice Michael Dion myself
I'm like why do I look unfinished I mean
I'm not wearing a lot of makeup tonight
at all but I didn't apply lipstick so
it's really hard for me to find any of
my lipsticks or lip glosses but I did
find this one it's cocoa bean by Gerard
I wanted a Brown that was like more of a
true brown and if you guys watched my
last video and hard when my lip combo
was there was like a hundred of them so
I hate how glosses look on me so I'm
going to add a little bit of powder to
make it matte and then I'm just going to
add a little bit of dose of color stone
over it cuz it's not quite the brown
that I was expecting baby where should
we go to E
um they're going to meet us for drinks
after so clearly I can't find a brown
that I like so I'm going to add a little
bit of Kapow I colour-pop see what this
does this is more what I was thinking
when I think like a good Brown I'm not
sure where we're going to dinner but I'm
gonna go put my jacket on and my shoes
on and I guess we'll figure it out
hi guys so it is Saturday around 4
o'clock I'm gonna go run in about two
minutes to go get some like appetizers
last night we took my aunt and uncle out
and we went to like a little sports bar
and we had some drinks for his birthday
it's so much fun and then earlier today
we took another trip back to our old
house when ran some errands and then I
just got ready and now I'm gonna go run
a few more errands the house is pretty
clean I always like have to clean
anything if no one's coming over and
yeah I'm gonna go get dressed I'm just
more like sweats I think it'll be my
make up and then wear sweats just to say
comfy but other than that I think that's
really it and I will see you guys in a
little bit go cheese so we leave on
Tuesday morning we're going to LA and
it's really funny because we booked this
trip when on Jeremy were staying with us
and they don't have a direct flight to
LA for some reason from their airport
they can't get a direct flight so they
fly to Atlanta and then they fly to LA
and we booked our flight on the same
airline and then we're flying to Atlanta
to meet them there and then fly to LA
together even though I'm gonna take in a
direct flight but we're never gonna play
together so we thought it'd be really
fun so that is what our plan is for the
way there which will be really fun I'm
definitely gonna blog so lately I feel
like all I've been buying our comfy
pajama white clothes I just got this new
ship feels like you're heaven this is
from Urban Outfitters it's just like a
I guess it's kind of like a sweater like
a sweater shawl and then I got pants
that are like the same material so
that's not wearing any
like the full day's be extra lazy
so we have our family cruise in February
I know I mentioned it I mentioned how
horrible of a company that coming at
screwed us over was I tweeted you guys
and I tweeted real Caribbean to see if
there was a way to bring all the cats on
the cruise because it's over a week and
my whole family is coming so I don't
have anyone that can watch the cats so I
don't know what we're gonna do if we're
not gonna be able to take them but
someone tweeted me this link to get like
emotional support registration for your
animals so I filled out this thing for
them like I guess trying to show that i
emotionally need them and we'll see if
i'm allowed to bring them i told my dad
this means like you're absolutely crazy
so we shall see if that works that will
be literally hilarious can you imagine
me just showing up with a crate with the
two cats like hi i'm ready to go on the
cruise my mom and everyone would think I
was freaking nuts but you still want to
leave them they're just little babies
though spot right in front that says I'm
the worst Parker ever but okay
at Star bees I'm gonna go run in oh I
was just in Reverse hi guys so we're
getting ready to go to Ikea I'm going to
pick out two drawers the bigger Alex
drawers I have some makeup that I want
to put away and I'm running out of space
so that is the plan we're doing anything
else road football today
let's just go
country song
one thing
my family
just about down through the family
because I started working
tell me which way to go
so she says does she owe more kisses
shady boo-boo
right
hi hi that was really weird yeah I don't
know what happened
thanks for helping
oh yeah and fresh
before you
so we finished building the drawers last
night hallelujah and it fit perfectly
like literally perfectly with this crazy
I'll probably put like a mirror like
horizontally right there and then I want
to ram a bunch of things and put it in
here on the wall like different
accomplishments and different magazine
articles and stuff like that that way
it's kind of hidden so it's not like I'm
showing off or anything but just because
I have it all saved and I've nowhere to
put it but so then this is this side I
still have all of my acrylic cases in
the other room I have to bring in here
but I think I'm going to get rid of this
shelf I'm not sure yet we'll see that
coming along so I also just picked up
from Amazon someone had mentioned to me
one of my subscribers about using this
it's pure shea butter and it comes in
like a thing like this and you mix it
with some types of oils and you mix
it with jojoba oil and supposed to be
really really good for your skin so I
got that maybe I'll do like a
do-it-yourself lotion video or something
but I also picked up there called vite
vite a I guess there are coconut oil
soaps so they're 100% pure and organic
and um a brush just ran by the door um I
don't know this so they're supposed
to be a lot better for you than some of
the other stuff so I guess I will try
them and see I also got this one because
it said it's for like eczema so I'll
keep you guys posted on these
best time
and each kid
Oh
I
everyone sees
yeah
you I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
