today's video I'm going to be doing a
first impressions and a review of the
new Kim Kardashian Kylie cosmetics
collab so I got this collection probably
about a week or two ago I can't really
remember but as soon as I got it I was
super excited to try it I just watch
them on my hand for you guys on snapchat
and I saw so many people asking me to do
a review video so I'm finally sitting
down today to try all of these out on my
actual space they look beautiful on the
swatches so I can't wait to see how they
look on my lips so these are gonna hear
my first impressions of the four new
shades then please keep watching
so I already did my makeup and I apply a
little bit of the exposed lip liner I'm
a type of person where I can't do lips
without a little bit of lip liner so
it's not really on there it's just more
for like the shading of my lips so
that's just something I like to do every
time I do it because otherwise I can't
give you an honest opinion on how I like
the shade so the first one that I'm
going to swatch is Kimberly and I really
love the packaging for these they have
like that matte light pink and they're
just gorgeous so let's see Kimberly on
the lips
these are cream liquid lipsticks so
they're a little bit different than the
other formulas that she has released I
believe
color top has a similar formula which is
like a matte cream as well I really like
those because I'm not a big gloss person
I prefer them that lipstick but I have
been using some of the clean ones as
well because they're not as drying on
your lips so if you guys tend to get
like that line and your lips get super
flaky and dry I'm sure this formula will
be better but let's try it out and stay
so one thing I noticed is that there's
no sense to these I know her other
shades have like a cupcake scent I don't
really have a preference I don't care so
lipstick has a scent to it I'm not
licking it or anything I got actually
really like this shape so I'm gonna let
it dry a little bit because right now
kinda looks a little glossy I don't know
if it's gonna say like that but offhand
I absolutely love this shade I feel like
this is a classic nude shade that came
always wears so it's been about a minute
and it still has that really creamy
texture to it so it kind of looks a
little blocky but it doesn't have like
that sleepy consistency so I actually
really love this nude shade I think it's
like the perfect pinky nude so yeah I
really like this and I like the formula
it feels really moisturizing on your
lips some knew that shades that I have
they kind of washed me out a little bit
they're like to light so for my skin
tone I think this is literally like the
most perfect nude and I'm not hating how
it looks kind of glossing normally with
glosses my problem is like my lips just
looks too big and I just don't like how
they look but with this one I feel like
has a perfect amount of shine so I'm
actually really happy with it and you
guys know that one thing I always do
with them always constantly mixing
lipstick shades it's like really hard
for me to find one that I really love
but I definitely will be going for this
one if I need like the perfect nude
because I feel like for my skin tone and
my complexion the shade is perfect the
next let's move on to Kim and wipe this
all I'm going to using my little Burt's
Bees white there's a cucumber in stage
so wipe this off
so they come off really easy so next up
I'm going to try Kim here is getting
stuck tiring this is definitely more
like an orange undertones like a peachy
undertone I'm noticing offhand that I
have to dip it a little bit more than
the original shade which not a problem
this is the second shade it has more
like a pinky peach undertone I actually
really like this one as well I feel like
this would be like the perfect shade for
like prom I don't know why when I saw
like how my makeup looks like like this
is like a cute problem look right here
so yeah I really like this one as well
again I like the consistency it covers
really nicely and it makes my lips feel
super moisturize I got with some people
when I do reviews like they're always
looking for something negative to say
and of course I'm going to be a large
percent honest with you guys if I do or
don't like it but so far I really do
like it I like the formula maybe even
over the mat I don't know maybe this
will replace my matte lipstick hole
somewhere I actually like we really love
this shade I feel like I'm going to
compare the first two I like this one
better but again they're different I
really like the first one is like a
simple classic nude and then this one is
like the perfect pinky peach nude and
yes I really like this one as well
you
all right we're going to wipe this off
and we're going to move on to the third
shade so I wasn't wiping it off like you
can see I haven't reapplied the lip
liner but it's still kind of there I
like using a more like warm tone lip
liner especially if I don't want
anything crazy just because it outlines
my lips a little bit more and they can
look a little bit bigger so that's just
a little trick
so how third shade that I would like to
use is Kiki machines you could tell us a
little bit more pigmented but when it
comes to lips I mean we don't need to do
one swipe and like oh that's it like we
can build it so as long as it looks good
overall does it feel to stick on the lip
steps listen for it
so this line is more like a bubblegum
pink I like this one as well but I
definitely like the first two more I'm
not huge on like pink lips if I were to
wear this I would probably mix this one
with like the more news one to give it a
little bit more of a muted pink but if
you're looking for that bubblegum pink
this is actually like a really pretty
color I know there's a few times where I
was going to look and I wanted a
lipstick like this and I would mix like
a more bright pink with like a nude and
I would get a very similar color to this
so I guess it's really all about what
colors that you're looking for it's just
super moisturizing and it gives it like
a little bit of a sheen which I like and
then we're going to wipe this one off
and we're going to try the last one so
the fourth shade is Kimmie
this is the fourth and final shade it's
more like an orange e pink it's
definitely the darkest of the four now
that I have tried them all on I would
have to say Kimberly and Kim are
definitely my favorite so I have to say
this one is probably my least favorite
out of the four but definitely because
again I'm boring I like all this pink
shades all the time but it is definitely
a really pretty shade I would have to
say overall I'm very impressed and I
approve of all of these shades
I love the formula they are beautiful
beautiful colors and I mean the
packaging alone if you guys are makeup
junkies like anything that stands out is
a little different than the norm always
grabs my attention so I think overall
these are amazing shades I'm going to
swatch all these on my hand next to each
other that way I can see them in
comparison and yeah so I'm actually
super excited with them I don't think I
have anything negative to say you guys
know I'm always honest if I had anything
to say I would but overall I'm really
happy with how they look I might have a
bit of my shy and sees see how we're
looking after that
so
when you do take a sip you can see it
does wipe off on to the straw I mean
what I always do because no matter what
anyone says your lipstick is not going
to last all day long no matter what I
mean unless you're not drinking not
evening not doing anything maybe you
have a chance but what I always do when
I'm going out and I have a full face of
makeup on I always bring whatever
lipstick shade with me so I'll bring my
lip liner and my lipstick and I'll just
apply it throughout the night whenever I
do need it just for fun while we're here
I'm going to add a little bit of
Kimberly into this and just see what it
looks like next together it's a little
bit so yeah lightens it up a little
which is really pretty so you need to go
out and get all four I mean that's
completely up to you they're very
similar they're all shades of nude it's
really all about which shade that you
like the bed I like how there's no sense
to them although either way it doesn't
bother me I've never had a problem with
any of her other products as far as this
compared to the matte I feel like this
is going to be the closest that I'll
ever get to wearing a gloss not only do
I not like how blossoms look on me I
hate like if you're out and then the
wind gets stuck on your lip so that
might be the same case with these but I
definitely will be using them again so
congratulations to Kim and Kylie these
are beautiful I think that's kind of
doing such an amazing job with her
products basically every single product
that I've ever used from her collection
are just so amazing and I've been very
happy with them they Beach I wanted to
say I approve but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and until
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
