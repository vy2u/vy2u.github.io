last night was the Super Bowl and she
wanted to talk about a few things the
first being did anyone else cry
literally every single commercial that
played the number one reason why I watch
the Super Bowl is usually because the
commercials are so funny but I literally
teared up and cried at every single
commercial I thought either a I have an
emotional issue or B they just did that
on purpose trying to connect with people
I'm not really sure but that was the
first thing and the second reason that I
watched it of course was for Katy
Perry's halftime performance I think she
did absolutely amazing I love how she
keeps everything super positive and just
there was bubbles everywhere the lights
just everything I thought was just so
great I loved her performance and when
they showed a close-up of her makeup I
literally paused it took like ten
pictures I was like guess I need to
recreate that look it's been so long
since I've done a Katy Perry inspired
look and some people think I looked like
her so I figured what better time to do
it then now another reason that I wanted
to film this is because I think it's a
perfect Valentine's Day look as well if
some of you guys are looking for some
inspiration this can be something you
guys can do with the glitter liner and
the red lips I do plan on putting up a
few other Valentine's Day look so don't
worry if you aren't really fond of this
look but if you guys want to learn how I
got this Katy Perry inspired makeup luck
please keep watching to prime my eyes
I'm just adding a tiny bit of concealer
from my Maybelline nude palette I'm
taking this matte nude color and I'm
applying it all over my eyelid next for
eyeliner I'm using this one by Tarte
it's the clay liner with the brush that
it came with we're going to do a nice
signature Katy Perry cat eye then with a
different eyeliner brush I'm using this
matte grey shadow from Sephora and this
one's in the shade Fifth Avenue what I'm
going to do is draw a second wing right
above the other wing that I did
then with a pencil brush in the same
gray color I'm going to start coloring
in my crease
you
and then I'm gonna blend
next we're glitter liner I'm using this
one by NYX and this is going to go right
above the black line
For Lashes I'm using these ones by
vellore these are the wispy sweet
nothings she looked like she had a very
natural kind of lashes on so that's why
I'm going to use these my pencil brush
I'm taking that same gray color and
lining underneath my lash line
and then with a black eye pencil I'm
lining right in my eye
so before I started the tutorial I did
my primer my foundation and my concealer
I also contoured my nose a little bit
but now I'm moving on
to contouring my face I'm going to be
using this color from my RC ma palette
and I'm going to start contouring
we're just doing a very light contour
for this look because Katy Perry always
has like a very natural-looking face and
then I'm setting my contour with the
cooler shade from the Kat Von D contour
palette
you
and then I'm setting my under eyes with
the yellow shade in this same palette
for blush I'm using sweet sentiment by
Mac
and then to highlight I'm using Becca
opal
I'm also going to take a little bit and
highlight right under my eye my eyebrow
I mean and also on the bridge of my nose
so now I'm moving on to lips I'm using
the color red by Mac to line them
then for lipstick I'm using fire engine
by Gerard cosmetics
you
then she had a cute little hoop nose
ring in I obviously don't have my nose
pierced so I took apart a piece of my
bracelet and let's say
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I will have a
few more Valentine's Day looks for you
guys so don't worry I have a lot of my
sleeve but I love you guys so much and
until next time I'll see you guys later
as the shadow girl</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
