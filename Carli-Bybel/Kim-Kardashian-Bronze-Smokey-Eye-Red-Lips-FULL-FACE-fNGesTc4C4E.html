today's glamorous look is inspired by
the beautiful Kim Kardashian I think
I've only done one makeup look inspired
by her and I haven't done celebrities in
a while so I was looking through tumblr
I'm looking through all kinds of
pictures and I came across this look and
I was absolutely in love with it and I
think it's been a couple months since I
posted a look with the red lips so if
you guys want to learn how to get this
Kim Kardashian inspired makeup look
please keep watching for foundation I'm
going to be using the new L'Oreal magic
nude liquid powder foundation you can
get this at any of the drugstores and I
just got this about a week ago and I'm
absolutely loving it right now since
Kim's look is always a very contoured
look just to save me some steps I'm
going to be using the darker color
foundation up on my forehead and around
my face I'm going to be using a little
bit of a lighter foundation to blend
that in
you
highlight under my eyes I'm gonna be
using by Mac it's a prep and prime and
it's the light boost and I always apply
this right under my eyes on the bridge
of my nose and here and on my chin
because I don't like putting the darker
foundation underneath these parts
because later on I do want to highlight
with concealer and it's gonna be a lot
harder to get it brighter if you use the
dark foundations
next thing in my eyebrows with my brow
bar by whitening lightening
using that same matte brown eyeshadow
from my eyebrows I'm gonna be now
contouring my nose
then using my map 109 brush I'm going to
start contouring my cheeks with again
the same matte brown eyeshadow
the stock brown color is going to go
right in my crease and then I'm going to
blend it outwards with the bigger brush
so I just applied my false lashes and my
mascara I'm gonna now do my lower lash
line I know a lot of people have been
asking why I do my bottom mascara and
then the eye shadow and that's because
when I do my bottom mascara since I do
like a lot of mascara it gets all
underneath my eyes so I always have to
take a makeup wipe and get it off so I
like to apply a couple coats do the
bottom line with an eye shadow and then
I go over the mascara one more time so
I'm taking that same bronzer color and
I'm gonna be lining my lower lash line
is breaking in you next to highlight I'm
using by Laura Mercier the secret
camouflage concealer in SC three and I'm
just going to be applying this on the
sides of my nose under my eyes basically
everywhere I highlighted with the prep
and pride
-
at least that's how it seems you used to
what you had to give then to set that
I'm using my makeup forever it's a
high-definition powder this is just so
it doesn't crease
you're my friend
you can fish
they don't
on two
so for my lips I'm going to use a dark
red lipliner and I'm going to fill it in
with a lighter red and it's gonna give
it that ombre effect so this one is by
Jordana and it's called Cabernet
to fill my lips and I'm gonna be using
by Ben Nye it's called Marilyn red
and what I always do is I go back to the
lipliner and I shade it in a little bit
and it's gonna give it again that ombre
look that we're going for
ah
so this is the finished result I hope
you guys enjoyed this video this look
obviously is a more dramatic look I saw
this on her at a red carpet event so I
would recommend this if you were going
out somewhere is again very dramatic but
I love all the bronzy colors especially
if you have a nice tan from the
summertime so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and comment below and let me
know if there's any other celebrities
you guys want me to recreate hope the
guys have a great day
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
