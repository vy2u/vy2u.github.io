it's been quite some time since I've
done a celebrity inspired makeup look
and over the weekend I saw Kim
Kardashian at the Javan Chi Fashion Show
so when I saw her hair makeup I insulin
was like yes I need to recreate that
because I just thought she looked so
glamourous so fab
and yeah so I want to see how I got this
hair and makeup please keep watching to
start off this look I'm going to be
priming my face with my new hard candy
purple primer for foundation I'm going
to be using my Chanel foundation and I'm
mixing it with my million-dollar tan
face bronzer I applied some self-tanner
before this video because Kim was super
tan for Fashion Week so applying this
with your foundation is going to give
you that nice bronzed face and not make
your face whiter than your body to fill
in my brows I'm using my brow bar to go
by whitening lightening and I'm using
the darker shade over that I'm applying
my clear brow gel next I'm going to be
contouring my nose and today I'm going
to use a powder to do this I'm using the
same brow powder from the brow bar to go
and I'm using a lip brush from Sigma I
like using this lip brush because it
gives it really good precision and it's
gonna help make the line straighter so
if you guys want a more in-depth
tutorial on how I do my nose I do have a
non-surgical nose chat video that you
guys can go check out that I will link
below
to blend in those lines I'm just using a
damp beauty blender
moving on to some contour I'm using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette
and I'm just applying this all over my
cheekbones on the sides of my forehead
under my chin and just blending in those
lines on my nose again
going back to my foundation brush I'm
just blending this all in picking up a
little bit of my concealer I'm applying
this underneath my eyes also on the
bridge of my nose and to blend all that
and I'm going back to my Beauty Blender
moving on to eyes I'm applying my Mac
pigment in the color melon on the inner
corners of my eyes and I'm also applying
the shade right under my brows i
recommend dipping your brush into fix+
or wetting your brush a little bit first
it's going to really bring out the color
of the pigment next up I'm picking this
light brown shimmer color from my cat
eyes two-faced palette and I'm applying
this on the outer part of my eye and
then once I've done that I'm grabbing a
big fluffy brush dipping it once or
twice into the shadow and just blending
it right into my crease
to add a little bit more dimension into
my eyes I'm using a smaller blending
brush and the darker brown shade from
the same toothpaste palette and I'm
applying that right on the outer V of my
eye so today I'm going to do lashes
before liner I'm using the Ardell
whispies and I'm applying my black gel
liner from Sigma with their new eyeliner
brush and this brush really makes doing
your eyeliner so much easier so if you
guys are looking for a great eyeliner
brush this one is my number one favorite
at the moment
grabbing that same a light brown shade
that I put on my lid I'm applying this
with a pencil brush right under my lower
lash line
and for mascara you guessed it L'Oreal
telescopic as usual
and next comes a black liner for my
inner lash line for blush I'm using this
new one by Revlon that I actually just
picked up from Walmart and it's a really
pretty cranberry color I will list the
exact name of it on my blog but I think
it looked really perfect with this look
and for a highlighter I'm using the is
it betty loumanizer no it's mary manizer
so I love that one is a really pretty
champagne color moving on to the lips
I'm using by Mac the lip liner in the
color plum and then over that I'm using
the MAC lipstick in mini moths
mini-malls mom however you say it but I
saw that Kim Kardashian's makeup artist
actually did use this lipstick for her
looked moving on to hair I'm going to be
doing a sleek back bun just like she had
it I'm sure most of you guys know how to
do a sleek ponytail and a bun but for
those of you who don't you're just gonna
take your hair put it into a ponytail
and try and get it as smooth as possible
I love spraying the hairspray and using
the brush before I put in the hair tie
that weights and you get really really
smooth also for this look I'm going to
be using two hair ties to really hold it
in so it gives it a nice sleek look and
it doesn't get loose
therefore making your head look even
bigger in my case we can't have that
happen because I have a big enough
forehead so I'm just gonna make it super
super tight and add a second hair tied
to the ponytail
if you have any small flyaway pieces
like me you can use your clear brow gel
to really pin them down I like using it
on my sideburns as well and it is
awesome I absolutely love using clear
brow gel for actual gel so after that
I'm going to take my ponytail and twist
it and I'm just gonna twist that twisted
piece around my ponytail and just slowly
form a bun
once you have it in the shape that you
want it you can just fasten it with
another hair tie I recommend using black
ones or if your hair is blonde like a
blonde shade of a hair tie because we
don't want anyone seeing this the bun is
going to be super tight if you want it a
little bit bigger you can just slowly
pull out some pieces just to make it a
little bit bigger like what I'm doing
right here and then any loose pieces or
any flyaways you can just spray down and
the stragglers we can pin down with a
few bobby pins
one last step because I was feeling a
little bit pale is I'm going to just add
some more bronzer this one's my Laura
Mercier all over my face with a big
fluffy brush just to kind of make my
face a little bit warmer looking once
you've done this you just want to take
your foundation brush and just blend it
in so there's no sharp lines
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video definitely
comment below let me know if there's any
other celebrity makeup looks that you
want to or you want me to recreate I
should say and also which Halloween
videos you want to see I have a bunch in
mind but I'd love to hear your opinion
and hear what you guys would like to see
so until next time I'll see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
