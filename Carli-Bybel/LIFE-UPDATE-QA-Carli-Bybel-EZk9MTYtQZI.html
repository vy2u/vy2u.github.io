much for watching I missed you guys
I know I've been m.i.a and I know in the
past six months I've probably said the
same thing in every video it's probably
really frustrating to hear it over and
over and over again but I took some time
off I feel like myself again
and I'm ready to come back on here and
talk about some things and I figured
what better time to do a Q&amp;amp;A than now so
I know you guys have so many questions
and I had posted it last night and you
guys have been sending me tweets all
night long and I'm gonna go through some
of them and answer some of your most
requested questions so it feels so good
to be sitting and filling for you guys
today I have been waiting for this
moment and I really wanted to make sure
that I was happy and myself again before
I came on and did this because I never
realized how much you guys really really
know me and if I'm not having a good day
or if I'm not feeling my absolute best
you guys can feel that and you can feel
the energy and I just wanted to take
some time off
regroup find myself again find my
happiness again and I can honestly say
I'm in a much better place now than I
have been for quite a while now so I'm
gonna go through some of your questions
right now so if you guys want to hear
what they are then please keep watching
so I'm gonna start off with one of the
most requested questions this one is
from Chantal flower and she wants to
know did Charlotte ever eat her
Thanksgiving dinner so if you guys don't
follow me on snapchat I put out a big
Thanksgiving feast for Charlotte and her
family and for those of you who don't
know Charlotte is my pet deer that's
outside who comes and eats out of my
hand
and yes they ate everything I left it
out for like two extra days and
everything is officially gone so they
enjoyed their Thanksgiving feast so I
saw some people asking that
I know that's been like the most
requested question right guys so I just
wanted to fill you in that yes she did
enjoy her feast and they ate every
little bit of it Michelle Garcia would
like to know what is your favorite book
so I talked about a few books probably
it's been probably over a year so I'll
mention them again so some of my
favorite books that I have on my eye
books that I've read some of them I read
like three or four times such as the
untethered soul seat of the soul I also
love the books of surrender experiment
that's by Michael a singer who is also
the author of the untethered soul so I
started reading those books back I'm
gonna say like four years ago maybe even
longer I had a lot of family things
going on when I was like really first
starting out my youtube channel or maybe
I was like a year into my youtube
channel and I turned to books for like
self-help and just to like learn more
and it really really really helped me
through all of my hard times so whenever
I'm feeling a little bit low or if I'm
feeling I'm like like I'm not having a
good day I'll always go back to those
same books and just to kind of relearn
what they were teaching because those
specific books have really helped me
think clearly about certain situations
and just kind of get back down to earth
and just to realize that although some
problems may feel like the end of the
world they're not and there's always
somebody who has it 9,000 times worse
than you so those are the books that I
always tend to go back to and I really
highly recommend if anyone is looking
for some self-help books or just kind of
like a new way of thinking I would say
that they definitely shaped my
personality for the better and once you
read them the first time it's a little
confusing second time maybe even so but
if you just keep rereading it and keep
reminding yourself it all kind of just
clicks and makes sense so those are the
three that I really really love I also
love mitch albom he was one of my
favorite authors growing up so the ones
that I have on here Tuesdays with Maurey
amazing book I highly recommend the five
people you meet in heaven for one more
day
have a little faith have a little faith
was really really good and then the
first phone call from heaven I didn't
finish that one yet but that one I'm
currently reading it's by Mitch Albom as
well so those are my top top books if
any of you guys have recommendations I'm
always looking so although I'm a very
visual learner it's books like that that
really help shape my mind and help me
open up my way of thinking so I think
those are definitely my favorite books
Tammi Scylla would like to know what is
your favorite foundation at the moment
and she says I love you and then he's
you girl so if you guys have been
watching my full face tutorials for a
while I've been using the Fiona Stiles
matte finish foundation these are
discontinued everywhere they're not
available on her website they're not
available on Ulta anymore and I just
found the luminous finish foundation on
QVC I've been using the luminous finish
and the reason I really love Fiona
Stiles is because the colors are just
really perfect for my skin tone I like
an olivey skin tone and sometimes my
foundations are either too yellow or too
pink and I just found that this color
was perfect for my skin tone so I've
really been liking the luminous finish
as well it's obviously a little bit
different than the matte but again the
matte is just completely discontinued
which I don't understand why she would
do that and the colors that I have this
in are five and six that's when I'm a
little bit more tan and then I also have
the matte foundation still in number
four but this is when I'm a little bit
paler so I'm trying to use it sparingly
because my number 5 of the matte is
completely gone Genisys Nicole would
like to know what accomplishment are you
most proud of the accomplishment I am
definitely most proud of is the
scholarship program that I created in
Cambodia we raised over one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars to send girls to
college to get an education in Cambodia
and I went out there back in April which
was the most amazing experience of my
life I was able to see the dorm rooms
that they were building with the money
that we donated and I just received an
email two days ago from the founder with
a video and some pictures of the girls
and I was just bawling in tears and it's
something so amazing and I just hope to
continue to do more and more things like
this like I feel like this is why I was
given my platform to do good things and
there's so many things that I do that I
don't talk about because when you do
good things for others you do it for
yourself and not to show off to other
people but that is one thing that I am
super proud of and I think it up-to-date
that is like my most proud thing that I
have accomplished I was waiting on the
cloud every sleepless night that I have
not brought me here it's so loud the
times will change and I'll feel safe and
you
hello Kelly I plan to be a banker now I

hello Kelly
I love Bravo and I love you
zero
see my scar
my
kristan @k proto would like to know
hi Carly I love you I love you too you
just want to know what you do to make
yourself feel better on really low days
some things that I like to do which I've
definitely talked about I love listening
to country music a lot of it's
depressing and sad but it's kind of nice
to hear songs that can relate to the
situation that you're going through so
one of my favorite things which I've
talked about before is I just love to
kind of just drive Windows cracks if
it's cold out our windows down if it's
warm out and then just kind of blasting
music and just singing at the top of my
lungs and for me that just like clears
my head I stopped thinking about my
problems and I just kind of focus on the
road and the music and that for me is
like therapy I also find it very helpful
to talk about how I'm feeling with
either my mom or my best friend um you
know it's always good to let things out
and not keep it in that's one of my
faults I would say is I keep a lot of
stuff in and I dwell on it and then I
don't realize how much it's actually
affecting me until I have other people
pointing it out or calling me out on it
so I think one of the biggest things
that I recommend for you guys and
something that I found that works for me
is if you're feeling a certain way if
you're having some issues or some
problems like talk about it with
somebody and if you don't have somebody
to talk about it with maybe go and see
someone to talk to like a therapist or
something like that and I know some
people are like oh Serapis like I would
never trust that I would never want to
talk to a stranger about my problems but
you'd be surprised how just being able
to talk about it or even writing it down
writing it in a journal just getting it
out of your head and on to a piece of
paper or out into the world it's gonna
help you feel so much better
so that's suddenly something I would
recommend for you guys because as much
as you think it's not affecting you and
as much as you think you're so strong
and you can keep it all in you can deal
with it yourself I promise you it's
gonna be a lot easier just getting it
out there and getting it off your chest
and
yeah so I think that would be my piece
of advice and that's also something I
like to do when I'm feeling down Holly
Sutherland would like to know what's the
one thing that motivates you and helps
you be so positive I have so many
different things that motivate me um I
would have to say though like the past
year I have been kind of unmotivated and
I've kind of been in like this weird
like fog because I was dwelling on so
many things and I was just not happy and
so many different aspects of my life and
I know that's like probably so weird to
hear because you guys see like the best
parts of my life on social media and
stuff like that but as perfect as people
make their lives look and as perfect as
you guys may think my life is like it's
so far from the truth and I think that's
one of the problems with social media
nowadays is like you guys only see the
good parts and then you compare your
lives to that and you think like oh well
like what am I doing wrong or why is my
life suck because I don't have all these
nice things or I don't look like this
person or I don't have these nice
clothes and all that stuff and I just
think it's like a toxic way to view your
life just know that every single person
on social media whose life looks perfect
I guarantee you that it's not and I
think that's the problem with social
media is like we're all afraid to show
like our flaws or like our hard times
and stuff like that because I don't know
it's like this certain image we try to
like withhold people in my everyday life
my friends my family like they know me
and they know I'm so far from perfect
and I guess I'm sorry that I don't show
more of that but I don't know it's hard
it's hard to like put yourself out there
a and then be like show like the real
reality of life and stuff like that so I
got so off topic but the one thing that
does motivate me is I would say you guys
motivate me probably more than you even
know when I don't provide content for
you guys and when I'm not staying active
on my social media I feel like this
overwhelming stress because I feel like
I'm letting you guys down and I get
really hard on myself so I know you guys
constantly
like the positive side of me but I'm not
always that positive although I try my
best at all times to remain as positive
as possible but there are so many times
where I'm unmotivated and I'm down on
myself and I'm hard on myself and I'm
always comparing myself to others and
stuff like that and I feel like I just
needed some time to just really ate how
I was feeling because there are so many
amazing good things happening but I have
so much going on in my personal life and
that really affected my work life so it
was like I was living like this double
life basically where I was enjoying all
the great moments and like trying to
live in the moment and just be super
excited but I also had so many other
things that were bothering me on a daily
and it's hard to balance when things are
going so amazing in one area of your
life and then it's not so amazing on the
other aspect so to get back to the
question again something that really
motivates me is I feel so blessed that I
was given this opportunity and I really
strongly believe I was given this
platform to do good and to do good
things and to help you guys and I feel
like I don't come on here and talk
enough to you and I know a lot of you
guys only watch me because of my makeup
and you want to learn how to do that
that's great but I mean the reason that
I started this whole thing was to help
people and when I started my inner
beauty channel like I lived for that
like getting to interact with you guys
and getting to talk to you guys and
helping you through like tough
situations because every single one of
us is going through something and when
you have someone to maybe give you a
little bit of advice and maybe a little
bit of their own personal life
experience when you hear something that
relates to your life and you you know
someone's going through something
similar you listen to what they have to
say versus someone in your life that's
telling you what to do but you don't you
feel they don't understand you or they
don't understand what's going on and
then you just kind of have it go in one
ear and out the other so I think the key
to staying positive is to just always
remember that we are here for a very
short period of time on earth if you
think about how long the earth has been
here like say we're a little blessed and
lucky that we get 80 90 100 years on
this earth
like that is such a small period of time
and you just have to try and not let
your struggles get the best of you and
just try to always see the positive in
the situation and try to look for the
positive and count your blessings and
think of like you know you woke up today
you're able to breathe you're able to
see you're able to walk like some people
don't even have that luxury so you just
gotta really focus on the little
important things not what you don't have
not what you can't get and I know money
struggles are definitely like a big top
priority for a lot of people but I think
if you focus so much on all of that and
all of the negative like you're not
gonna ever get out of that place and you
just have to make plans write stuff down
set goals and just see more for yourself
and see more for your life because when
you envision your life being better and
you write stuff down and you actually
follow through with things you will make
big changes and only you have the power
to change your life there's nobody
that's gonna ever do it for you you
can't sit back and wait for someone to
do things for you you have to take
matters into your own hand and you need
to take control of your own life and do
what's gonna make you happy because at
the end of the day no matter how many
people you try and make happy in your
life it doesn't matter because at the
end of the day if you're not happy
nothing else matters so you have to
focus on you you have to focus on
getting your life right your life happy
and then you can worry about all the
other struggles and problems that come
with life because then you'll be able to
face anything like you just have to be a
strong independent person not depend on
anybody and just get your head straight
and remember what's important and what's
not important so I feel like I just
rambled on and on and on and I hope that
made some sort of sense but so I know
99% of you guys watching this right now
all have the same question and it's not
like I'm avoiding it I just kind of
wanted to like loosen up a little bit
before I brought it up but I guess now
is the time to kind of address the
elephant in the room I know it's like my
most requested question I know it's all
over social media for the past couple of
and everyone wants to know if me and
Brett are still together so I wasn't
ready to talk about anything for a while
and I feel like now I'm ready to at
least bring it up and just let you guys
know what the deal is because we made
our relationships so public and I mean
you guys saw like the best of us you
know we made videos together and like
you saw like the photos and stuff like
that but we are broken up so I know I'm
sorry to be the bearer of bad news I
know you guys are probably upset like
think about how I feel it wasn't
something that was fun or ever planned
or what I ever thought would happen but
it is the reality and I respect him so
much as a person and I know we'll remain
friends hopefully forever because we
have been through so much together
yeah it's hard to talk about I don't
really know what I'm gonna say but like
he's such an amazing person and I wish
nothing but like the best for him but
again you guys only get to see like what
it's like through social media and on
videos and stuff like that but you're
not there on like a daily everyday basis
so there was so much then I'm not gonna
get into because out of the respect for
him and me like I think it deserves
privacy um and I really like had nothing
prepared on like what I was gonna say
like my mom's like alright well like
what are you gonna say and I was like I
have no idea I'm just gonna kind of sit
down whatever comes out comes out but I
just want to let you guys know that like
it just people change and people grow
apart and I don't want you guys to think
like I saw so many people saying like if
you two broke up like how could we ever
believe in love and I don't want you to
ever doubt that there's not love out
there real true love and like I will
always love him and I he will always
have a place in my heart like he's we've
been together there's so much but there
comes a time where you need to worry
about you and your happiness and that
needs to come first and foremost so a
lot of the relationship that you saw was
through social media and obviously like
I mentioned
earlier like people show their best
parts of their life on social media you
never see what happens on a daily basis
you never see like all that stuff so I
just want to say for those of you guys
who think you can't believe in love now
like please don't think that I don't
think that like I still believe in love
like I my grandparents were married 64
years like I believe that that is still
possible and I just also believe that
both people have to be happy and if
that's not the case and you try to work
through it and it's just not something
you see like you just have to worry
about you because if you're not happy
and you're not in a good place like the
relationship will never be in a good
place
yeah I don't know it's hard it's hard to
talk about obviously and I'm sorry to
let you guys down but just know that it
was something that had to happen and I'm
gonna be okay he's gonna be okay and you
guys are gonna be okay and obviously
like moving into this house like getting
all my cats like I never thought that
this would happen and it sucks but you
know what life is never easy and you
can't stay with somebody because of
things that you have together so I am
gonna be moving soon I already bought
like a smaller place closer to my
friends and family so that obviously is
hard you know but there's way more
important things than the materialistic
aspects of life so just know that I'm
gonna be okay and he's gonna be okay and
you never know what the future brings
but I feel that this is the right thing
for both of us at this point in our
lives and yeah so maybe one day I'll
talk a little bit more in detail but for
now that's really all I have to say
about that subject so I hope that
answered your questions I'm sure 90% are
you gonna click off at this point but if
you want to hear some more questions
then just keep watching
Clarissa wants to know are you genuinely
okay I genuinely am okay
I really believe that like there was a
long period of time where I wasn't okay
and I wasn't myself and it was I was
very unhappy like every single day of my
life
and it was also during a time where
there were so many amazing things
happening in my career so I was kind of
you know on the outside pretending
everything was good and trying to be as
happy as possible but also just not
being happy but I can honestly say like
right now in my life I am genuinely
happy I'm genuinely okay and I feel like
myself again and I feel like the part of
me that I felt that I lost I'm starting
to get back and it feels good
so yeah I'm genuinely okay grande world
would like to know if you had the chance
to do anyone in the world's makeup who
would you choose anyone in the world
that's a very hard question because
there's so many people that there's so
many people's makeup that I would love
to do but I probably so afraid to do
that like I had the opportunity to do
Katy Perry's makeup back when she was
doing like that live thing for her new
album and I turned it down because I was
super nervous and I was like okay live
like that's freaking me out and then
also like you had to only use covergirl
products because she is sponsored by
covergirl so I would have loved to do
her makeup if I was able to use all of
my own products so I wouldn't know that
I would come out really nice so I think
that I would love to do her makeup I
haven't done anyone's makeup in a long
time like I've done my sister and my
best friend which I know their faces so
well that it's like doing my own face
but I really enjoyed doing makeup on
other people because especially people
that don't wear a lot of makeup because
I just love seeing their reaction
afterwards and them just like feeling
really beautiful and then being like
like I didn't know we can look this good
so like one night I actually had a bunch
of friends over and we all had a few
drinks and I was like let's go upstairs
and do makeovers and I was like
contouring everybody's nose and I was
sitting here listening to every single
one of them like bash themselves and
totally rip themselves apart being like
I hate my nose I hate
this I hate that and I was like give me
ten minutes let me just do a little bit
of nose contour and all them were like
just blown away so I think I would get
more joy out of doing someone's makeup
who's not used to wearing makeup or
who's not used to having like full glam
because it's really cool to just see
their reaction to see like okay you know
what like you're so hard on yourself but
like if you took the time and didn't
your makeup just like me like you'd look
just as good it's just you know some
people don't want to spend the time or
they don't know how to do it so yeah so
uh I guess anyone in the world I told
you guys like who celebrity wise but
maybe I should start doing some classes
I've thought about that like doing
classes like all around the u.s. maybe
other countries because I'm just a
regular person I know you guys see me as
like more than that but I'm just like a
regular girl that looks absolutely
regular without any makeup on I just
learned some tricks and I know how to
like get myself super glam so yeah
Cheyenne Kozue would like to know sorry
if I said your name wrong hey beautiful
I recently decided to start up my own
beauty channel any tips and advice what
camera editing software etc you always
inspired me to switch over to the vegan
lifestyle I love you thanks for being
such an inspiration first of all I love
you you're so sweet
I think that's such an amazing idea I
always say to people like if you feel
like you want to start a YouTube channel
you should do it we are in the age now
where social media has taken over and
it's so much fun like this has been
obviously the best thing that I've ever
done in my entire life and you learned
so much more about yourself and to
answer your question the camera that I'm
filming on right now is my sony a 5100 I
also use my Canon 5d Mark 3 that's for
like the blurred background and like the
nicer quality so I use that I edit with
Final Cut Pro although I did start with
I'm Lee which comes free on the Mac's
I would recommend a Mac computer if you
are going to be editing I did have a
Windows and I just personally find that
Mac's are better as far as editing and
stuff like that I use
Manfrotto tripod I can do a video if you
guys want where I show literally every
single thing that I use to film if
that's something that you guys want
definitely let me know comment below I
could do that because I feel like me
saying it and me showing it is
completely different and all and since I
am using it right now to film I can't
really show you guys but I think go for
it I think you need to just be yourself
don't try to be anybody else and just
have fun with it like you're alone in
your room and I think that's the best
part of it I know so many people
nowadays like have a whole production
and have a million people behind the
camera and all that and I think although
it looks amazing the quality and all of
that I think just being by yourself or
maybe having just one person help you
you couldn't really really be yourself
and you can just talk and you can just
let loose and no one's here to judge you
and for me I get super nervous speaking
in front of people like that is one of
my biggest fears which I will work on
that this year
that's definitely one of my goals in
mine but when you're alone and you could
be yourself it's a beautiful thing like
when I first started I was shy even
filming by myself because I was not even
sure of who I was and you just find out
who you are that way and by editing it
back you get to you know see different
parts of your personality and see things
that you do wrong and things you should
change and yeah so that's my so I think
that is it for now I don't want this
video to be like an hour long I hope I
cleared up some of the questions that
you guys have had I do apologize again
for kind of being m.i.a not just the
past month the past like year I would
say I have not really been myself and
been as active as I normally have been
and I promise that will change I am now
focusing just on myself and I'm trying
my absolute best to get back to where I
once was so thank you guys for your
support your love your amazing comments
and your respect because honestly you
guys have no idea how much you mean to
me and how much you helped me get
through a lot of horrible times in my
own personal life but you guys need to
know that no matter what is going on as
bad as it may be right now like it will
get better
you can get through anything and the
number one key is to just focus on
yourself and get to a point where you're
very strong mentally physically and
anything that comes your way will be a
lot easier to deal with so definitely
recommend some of those books that I was
telling you guys about also while I'm
talking about those self-help books the
app relax and sleep well I've talked
about that before too I have been
listening to that a bunch and it's just
some guided meditation that you can do
whether you want to do it during the day
or while you're going to sleep it's just
really helpful and it's personally
helped me a lot in my life so thank you
guys for understanding and for being
patient with me while I was trying to
figure out all the stuff going on in my
own life but I love you guys so much
thank you for watching and until next
time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
