it's been a while since I've done a
celeb look for less and I've seen a lot
of people requesting it while I was
watching the VMAs over the weekend as
soon as I saw Gigi Hadid she blew me
away I think she was definitely best
dressed in my opinion
besides Taylor Swift Taylor Swift's my
number one but Gigi looked so gorgeous
and I loved her dewy glowy look it was
super natural and bright yellow dress
she literally looked like a Barbie doll
don't mind this hair that I got going on
um to be honest I probably could have
done it a little bit better but my hair
still has curls in it from yesterday and
I didn't feel like straightening it so I
just kind of slicked it back just to
give it the effect that she had um if
you guys want a real slick back tutorial
I can definitely do something like that
for you guys just let me know
but I really wanted to focus on the dewy
glowing makeup look that she had for the
VMAs so if you guys want to see how I
got this super dewy look please keep
watching start off this look I'm using
the Loreal magic blur to blur out my
face I always prefer a blurring primer
so this is what I'm using in place of my
normal maybe a little bit more expensive
primer this one's super affordable you
can get at your drugstore and I am just
applying this in a downward motion all
over my face for a foundation I'm mixing
my magic Lumi foundation along with this
highlighter and I think it's called
golden glow and I am just painting this
onto my face with a foundation brush and
then I'm going in with my damp Beauty
Blender and I'm blending it all out one
thing to always keep in mind is when
you're applying foundation onto your
face always drag it down to your neck
that way it matches your chest and your
arms
moving on to concealer I am using the
dark circle eraser from Maybelline and
I'm applying this underneath my eyes on
the bridge of my nose on my chin and
also on my smile lines now this
concealer is probably way too light I
had gotten a spray tan about a week ago
and I have a little bit left on my body
but my face is just super pale so after
I applied it I kind of realized that
maybe I should have gotten a darker
color for this look but it's okay
because I'm going to show you how I'm
going to warm it up in a minute I'm
contouring my nose with the la girl
concealer and beautiful bronze I'm also
applying this on my cheekbones around my
forehead and on my jaw line originally I
wasn't gonna do a cream contour for this
look but since my face looks super super
pale compared to my body I wanted to
warm up the entire face so adding a dark
color like this will give you a darker
complexion also don't think that this is
like so much makeup when you blend
everything in it all kind of blends
together and it's not cakey and it
doesn't look weird in person so although
this may seem like a lot it's really not
that much so I'm blending this in with
my Mac brush and then I'm going with my
fingers and blending in my nose
so since this look is super super dewy I
wanted to add a little bit of a cream
blush to this look her face was super
tan there wasn't much blush on it but I
just wanted to add a little bit more
color to my cheeks
then with my Knicks loose powder I'm
sitting right underneath my eyes you'd
have to set our concealer otherwise it
will move all over the place to add more
Sheen and glow to your look we'll be
adding a highlighter at the end of this
routine so don't worry the powder won't
ruin the look
moving on to brows I'm gonna add a
little bit of a higher arch to my brows
because she has very arched gorgeous
brows so I'm gonna try and make mine
look as close to hers as possible
obviously I have darker eyebrows darker
hair so we're not gonna look exactly
like her but we want to get that same
shape to really lift your eyes so that
is what I'm doing right here then moving
on to eyes I am using my new Carli bybel
palette I am using this gold color right
here and I'm applying that all over my
eyelids I'm also applying that color in
my tear duct and underneath my eyebrows
picking up a little bit of the shimmery
brown color with a small blending brush
I'm applying this right into the crease
of my eye just use a tiny bit because
this look was very very natural then I'm
applying my wispy lashes and I'm going
in with a large blending brush with
nothing on it and I'm just blending the
gold color in with the brown color again
her look was very very natural so we
didn't want to do anything crazy for
this with a pencil brush I'm picking up
a little bit of that same brown shimmer
color and I'm applying it on my lower
lash line again just a tiny bit then
comes mascara I'm only applying mascara
to my top lashes for this look this is
the first time that I've ever not
applied bottom mascara so I feel like I
look so different just for that one
reason but I noticed she didn't have any
bottom mascara so that is what I'm going
with for this look I'm picking up a
little bit of the dark shimmer bronzer
from my palette and I'm applying that
right on my cheeks this is going to
start the whole glow process for blush
I'm using a little bit of this peach NYX
blush again just a little bit to give me
some more color then I'm grabbing the
gold highlighter shade from my palette
and I am starting to highlight my face
right on the bridge of my nose on my
cheekbones on my chin my Cupid's bow and
above my brows
for lips I'm using my NYX natural lip
liner and for lip gloss I'm using this
one by Milani it's a beautiful sheer
nude shade I don't know the name off the
top of my head but I will be listing
everything below and the final step for
this look is to spray your face with the
NYX dewy settings brides give you that
beautiful dewy finish so next moving on
to hair if I wanted it to look just like
hers it probably would have taken a lot
longer and my hair is curled right now
so I was not thinking ahead of time but
this is as good as it's gonna get for
now so we're gonna work with it
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video also I wanted to
announce that my palette will officially
launch on September 8th which is Tuesday
which is in six days
so get ready I'm so excited for it to
finally come out I can't wait to hear
