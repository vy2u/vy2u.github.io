for me it feels like morning it's 12:45
I'm heading down to Asbury Park to meet
a friend that I haven't seen in a very
long time for lunch so we were supposed
to have construction back at her house
this morning and they still haven't
shown up obviously so I was planning on
getting up really early this morning
because they were supposed to be here
like seven or eight fruit flies but I
set my alarm and then he texted me
saying that they don't know what time
they're gonna be there whatever so I
ended up sleeping a little bit later
than I had planned I had like the
craziest dream ever do you know when
you're in like a dream and it feels so
real and like someone tries to wake you
up and like you get really mad and you
want to like get right back into that
dream well that was literally me this
morning it's really crazy because I
actually wanted to call it because I
remember at one point he like woke me up
and he was like you were like not
breathing for a couple like seconds like
it was weird and then also you took like
a deep breath and I'm like I remember in
the moment I was like no no like I want
to go back to my dream so I want to
actually call him I'm gonna call him
really good because
I was dreaming about my papa
right at that time and was so crazy
because I remember like all of a sudden
like a image popping up on the TV of him
like talking and in my dream I like hop
like this like in my dream and I guess
that and that was like right when he
woke me up to him so crazy people hi um
I have a question because I was just
blogging and I remember so this morning
didn't you like shake me because I
wasn't breathing or something we're you
snoring that's only not your second son
Jesus you know supposed to say that
you're not supposed to say I was snoring
you're intensely smart looking right
yeah stop that was like
she sleep at the end is this is this
Chinese weren't breeding and I'll sign
you going and I'm like what and I just
woke you up with my team decided no took
us game rooms
uh yeah novel it's so crazy because you
know when you like are in such a good
dream and you don't want to wake up
because you want to just like still
being your dream or whatever I was kind
of like the weirdest freakin dream of
all time like I'm not even to go into
detail of all that stuff but right when
you woke me up I like a TV screen just
like popped up and it was my papa and he
was like talking to me I was like oh
like that in my dream right when you
like woke me up but then you well you
weren't breathing and I was like that
was a great at that like I had just seen
him and he was like talking and I was
like in my dream
is that weird
I know and that's why when you when you
woke me up I was like no I wanna go
right back to sleep because I was like
you know but like I wasn't even awake
but I remembered you saying that so
weird right
I feel like dreams really mean something
or they're like somewhere else like we
go
he just texted me but I'm not gonna look
right now I
we always have like crazy conversation
we watched like all kinds of
documentaries and I just really believe
like when you dream like you're dreaming
through sometimes people sleep like six
seven eight twelve like the pens on the
day like hours that's a big portion of
your day that's almost half of your day
like where are we where do we go dreams
have to mean something
smile didn't Inga's on a Sunday morning
and I can't quite find good morning
it's like 9:30 they've been at our house
since 8:00 and it's been crazy crazy
loud I just wanted to get out of the
house plus I had a lot to do um I'm
gonna go grab some coffee then I'm gonna
go to the post office then pet some
Petco because I have to get some pet
food and debating whether I should go to
the food store as well because there's
literally no food in the house
whatsoever yeah that's my schedule for
today I got my does he Perkins
sunglasses on
I love these ones these ones are really
cute um it's with her collab with I'm so
bad like I don't know if it's kay key I
think it's key maybe it's clay I'm not
exactly sure how to pronounce it but I
really love these sunglasses I got these
and I got which other ones that I get
the ones that were like more of like a
cat eye 20 cat I would like the mirrored
front so cute
ah why these everywhere
why
to Pierre so they have like this huge
sander they are restaining the steps so
I thought they could just like stain on
top of the scene but they have to sand
everything down to restate it to get it
to that black color so it's so cool
because they have this sander that has a
go vacuum already attached to it so it
just sucks up all that like black dust
that would obviously be all over my
house otherwise and it just comes off so
easily so the steps are like a light
beige right now it's really crazy I
think they're going to start staining
that they're going to finish off the
molding and then I'm hoping they're
going to start the floors tomorrow thank
you guys for bearing with me I always
like to get them a little bit of a
variety so these are the ones I usually
get
with the pickiest years over by the way
this was fun
I don't know why didn't get a card to go
get a card try this again that's with
this one so I got two
don't
so I just love Petco I was gonna go get
food but I'm gonna go do that a little
bit later I'm gonna go home and just
take care of some things completely
forgot to have something that's due
today which I can't tell you guys about
yet but um I'm really excited and I
can't wait to share it with you guys so
I just got to go home and take care of
all of that and then I'm gonna run back
out a little bit later so
when you're lost I'll leave you
the window and the days up on us now we
don't know where - I'm not sense
but I try to be on
is a few things you use
so delivery this is the outfit that I
picked out also a pair of thigh-highs
that I liked from the collection so
hopefully the dress fits it's a romper
and we shall see so this is the romper
that I picked out unfortunately it's
just way too big I would need it hemmed
and I feel like it's to be really really
tall to wear it has like these little
flaps on the side so I feel like Kendall
would probably look amazing in this but
I don't know it was just a little too
big so I'm gonna wear something else
tonight so these are the boots
I just tried them on they're so comfy
and I love them because they have like a
grip up at the top so they look like
they're going to be staying up all night
um the other ones that I have I'm always
constantly having to pull them up which
is kind of annoying so I'm literally in
love with these so cute I also got this
little cutie that's a
so last minute we decided we're going to
learn highly
I don't know what like their launch
party or something no I didn't tell you
guys about this earlier but I know and
I'm like to want to go with me so it's
538 really high
Oh mother

I'm so happy my dress broke something

talking I got makeup
oh my god

when you
we lost
so excited I just got my delivery in
from Z Gallerie
half of the deliveries I'm not going to
open anything or put anything out yet
because there's still so much
construction going on but I ordered a
bunch of pillows like two little trees
um what else did I get
I got a rug and a rug pad and I think
that was really it that came what I'm
still waiting for are I ordered new
barstools I wanted to show you guys this
as well I picked these up the other day
they're almost gone it's liquid organic
and it's fresh coconut and fresh papaya
juice there's like no sugar added or
anything like that GMO free it's all
organic and everything and they are
unbelievable this right here tastes like
a pina colada

we just got my dress delivered it is so
cute it's black I'll show you guys it in
a second and also this beautiful choker

that I chose so we're getting ready to
leave I'll show you guys my outfit once

on our way hoping we make it on time
so these shoulders are like quite
serious I'm feeling like a spice girl my
lips are cracking off no big deal second
times has happened with this lipstick

I'll be there when your days long hold
you up if you don't feel strong light

you're lost

bullets it's so hot out I'm wearing long
sleeves and I had a jacket on but this
is my beautiful Michael Costello dress
I'm sure you guys were seen it at this
point in the vlog but I also got this
gorgeous necklace from Swarovski the
show was so amazing we had so much fun
we're heading home now going to go grab
something to eat
Brett's hungry so I guess I have to go
out in this outfit so it should be
interesting
all of the clothes were so beautiful and
Michael told me that if I have an event
that I need to wear anything to that I
can pick out whatever the wanted which I
was dying

beautiful so we had so much fun another
