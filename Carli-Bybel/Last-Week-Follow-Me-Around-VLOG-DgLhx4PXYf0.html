we are on our way up to our house right
now we are meeting and the TV guy he's
going to hang our TV for us and we also
have our easy alarms coming
today so
smiled it lingers on a Sunday morning
and I can't quite find write your own
book
everything we've seen on them too you
seem like such a cool dude
so these are the stools that I got do
you like them they have like little gold
studs on them I think I need a um steam
them a little bit but I like how they
look I have like the black wood legs so
this is my future Beauty room the walls
are kind of like a gray right now which
is perfect because that's what I wanted
closet back here which is perfect
because I'm gonna put all of my IKEA
drawers in here that way I can keep it
really neat out in the room so I'm
ripping up the carpet and I'm going to
do grey wood on the floor so here are
all the little samples I decided to go
with this one right here it's actually a
tile it's not even real wood it's a tile
so that way it's easier to clean so
that'll be nice I don't have an exact
date when we're doing that but hopefully
within the next week or so I'm waiting
to hear back when they can come in but I
was torn between this one and this one
but I feel like this one looks more like
wood and it feels like wood where this
kind of looks more like a tile this
right here is just the bathroom but I
love how the room has lighting all
around it just gives it a nice little
touch so we just had the guys here to
hook up the TV and to mount it on the
wall and of course the mount that I
bought wasn't didn't extend enough
there's like this molding that goes
around the fireplace and has to go in
the molding and it didn't extend long
enough so of course we had an order one
that won't be coming till Wednesday so
we have to reschedule for them to come
back on Wednesday which I feel really
bad because they drove like a half hour
to get here so but the ones that we need
they don't sell in store apparently so
we just ordered it and I don't know what
we're going to now she'll see but I
already picked up all my mascara because
I'm stressed out and a crazy batch
so we just went to Home Depot I had a
pickup I don't know it's size so
obviously I'll keep the receipt but I
had to pick up these little things for
the bottoms of the stools that way they
don't ruin the hardwood floor I'm gonna
assume that there are these these look a
little bit big hi guys so I just
finished filming my holiday gift guide
that should be going up later today umm
what do I have planned today I'm going
back up to the house probably in about
an hour I'm meaning the painter because
we are having a couple of rooms painted
it's so funny because our first house in
Jackson had one wall that was red like a
dark red and when we first moved there I
actually liked the red but when we moved
to the place where now the dining room
the bottom half was all a deep red so I
kind of felt like that was meant to be
each house that we were in had dark red
I did cover the red with some temper and
now in the new house my arm hurts so
it's funny because in the new house that
we got the office is a dark red and
we're actually gonna make the office
into a living room so I want it like a
light gray so we're going to get rid of
the red so I'm meeting the painter today
just to kind of do a little walkthrough
and see what we want to get fixed and I
don't know what else we're doing but I
think that's it as of now I will bring
you guys along for the ride um yeah
that's it
that is it windstorm
it's literally like him Donna oh I like
their looking like piece yet maybe I'm
driving I can't look hard should I have
check carts dragging a box underneath
literally destroying your box
cardboard box back
a leader to kiss you and I give no knee
as we both fall
but is currently 819 we are headed up to
the house we have a chandelier that's
being delivered they're actually at the
house now I think they're going to
actually just leave it by a garage for
us and then we are meeting the painter
today because Brett went to meet them
yesterday and he had to cancel so he
took the trip all the way up there and
then had to come back when I was editing
all day didn't get it up to like
midnight so I'm really tired right now
but it's okay we're stuck in
bumper-to-bumper the past
forty minutes and we're about 30 minutes
away stuff so
like when the dog comes
wait
when you're lost Oh
look out the window in the days of on
now we don't know where to I'm not
sentimental but I try to be on
is a few things you should know
literally say where are we going over
the Dever know what about Kree malicious
where's that to the right bagels
right or which ones did you go to
already so he just picked up bagels this
is our third bagel store near our house
um the first one we didn't have too
great of an experience the guy was like
touching all the cash and then he was
touching our bagels and he had just put
the butter on Bret was like can you
toast it in the guys like too late so
that was our first experience so we're
like okay we won't be going back there
and then our second experience was all
right if you like those second bagels
that not oh it was like rinky-dink yeah
we go to this wheelchair doing it
without go up so that blocks I'm not I'm
not really big into like confrontations
or like telling everybody like do your
job this way it's just when you're
hitting loading you're coughing in your
in your elbow like this one was a
coughing just don't touch you like
gloves on yeah I'll feel much better
about eating the food that's you don't
even normally notice because about our
bagel store by our house Haley oh yeah I
mean they'll make our sandwich and then
they make mine and they say my sandwich
I mean like you know like a tuna or
something or like a bagel and every new
bagel they put on a new pair of gloves
and I just love that yeah it always
keeps the food exactly the way the
person borders you know just shut out

route I miss you route 9 north between
old bridge and going into Sayreville and
a bagel talk the best bagels literally
