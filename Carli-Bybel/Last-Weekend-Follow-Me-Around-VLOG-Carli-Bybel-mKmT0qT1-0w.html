around like one I got ready finally into
film today so I wanted to do like
natural makeup today I don't know what
was wrong with me this week it was that
time of the month and I don't know what
was going on but I didn't put makeup on
like an ounce of makeup on all week and
I was just very lazy I stayed in pajamas
and I don't know I'm just kind of having
like a relaxing weird emotional type of
week so it's already Friday and I didn't
film anything this week and I'm gonna
type of person work I don't film like I
get so stressed out it's been 16 days on
my plant-based vegan diet and I know
originally I said I was gonna do like
the first 30 days and like take you guys
along with me but the last thing that I
want to do is recommend something that
may not be 100% accurate so since we've
switched over to the plant-based diet
and hasn't been hard like I haven't been
craving anything that had animal
products in it but it's just been hard
to get enough calories in so we're
trying to like figure out our whole
routine our whole schedule before we
share it with you guys because I don't
want to recommend something and then you
guys are not getting enough calories are
not enough nutrition so we've just been
really trying to figure out our own
routine and our own schedule and just
trying to get enough calories in and
everything like that but my eczema on my
hand is literally gone um that's really
exciting this one was the one that I
hated the most because I mean when I'm
talking when I'm interacting with people
like you just see it there is a patch on
my leg that hasn't healed yet a lot of
the other parts of my body has healed
but there are some areas that haven't so
I had spoke to a few people and they
were saying try to cut out grains for a
few days and see if that helps but it's
so hard because they know means some
carbs and some grains so we'll see but I
mean it looks so much better than it did
it's a lot smaller but it's still there
so I'm not going to say that this has
made my eczema 100% go away because it
hasn't but in certain areas it's me to
go away where this one
and has not gone away in well over a
year so the fact that it's completely
cleared is huge for me um so I
definitely recommend it if you guys have
any skin problem psoriasis eczema
I think this diet will really really
really help you guys out so I figured I
would just take you guys along the next
couple of days and to show you some of
my favorite foods that I've been eating
there are a bunch of channels that have
only vegan options for meals and they
have everything from like burgers to mac
&amp;amp; cheese and like all the Americanized
foods that so many people have a hard
time giving up yesterday we went to a
restaurant in New Brunswick called vegan
eyes and I have found the place a couple
weeks ago and we were looking for like
vegan restaurants and we finally went
yesterday and I'm not even lying when I
tell you that the burger that I had was
the best burger hands-down that I've
ever had period like I've had a millions
of burgers burgers were always my thing
and the burger was made out of
portobello mushroom
they had pickles and tomato and cheese
and B and cheese and eggplant and just
the sauce on it tasted like the in and
out sauce so I think the mixture of
everything together was literally like
we would every bite of like mmm like
savoring every bite like such a freak
they also had hot dogs there my mom
loves hot dogs so I can't wait to bring
everybody my family over to that spot
because when people hear vegan they get
scared and they think like all I'm gonna
eat our fruits and vegetables like I
can't do that no no one could do
that so the next couple days I figured I
would just show you what I've been
eating we do have to go food shopping
later so I'll probably take you guys
with us to go food shopping there's this
vegan market that this lady told us
about the other night
so my favorite breakfast that I've been
having almost every morning is banana
which were out bananas now that's why in
vlogs sooner but I've been having like
three bananas three or four bananas this
vegan vanilla protein shake that bread
always gets we've been drinking them for
like over a year I just love the peace
of it so that has been my liquid in it
ice chia seeds a little bit of vanilla
extract and spinach and blend it all
together and it's just so creamy and so
delicious I'm not sick of it yet I kind
of go through these stages where I'll
have like the same thing
every single day and I'll be obsessed
and then all of a sudden all I get sick
of it so I'm not sick of it yet so
that's when my morning smoothie every
single morning so now I'm like getting
hungry and I kind of want to have like
some soup or something good I'll fill
you in on what's been going on um as far
as his floor so this is my foyer you see
how this area is so like white and grey
they came they were 25 boxes short so
they came into this other side and these
are all like beige and yellow so now
he's not giving me my money back he's
telling me I picked the wrong marble
meanwhile no sir you decided to not
order enough boxes so when you ordered
it again it was from a different lot and
yeah so frustrating so I'm going to get
my Robin so this is my favorite one the
organic chicken flavored one I also
tried this one the Chinese noodle it was
okay but this one is definitely better
okay so I have my ramen I put like half
of the amount of the powder in it so we
have a water cooler that has um hot
water on top but we ran out of the water
we have a new delivery coming so today I
had to put it in the microwave I hate
using the microwave to be honest just I
don't know I try to avoid it at all cost
but today it's got to happen oh it
smells so good guys so I know I haven't
really shown you guys much of the house
um I'll show you guys it in pieces but
this is our kitchen it's kind of a mess
right now but I just wanted to show you
guys this is our old backdrop not old
this is how we bought it with like this
dark gray color we're gonna swap all
that out we're gonna do like white shiny
brick and then some sort of design right
here I just want it all white to kind of
really brighten it up the granite tops
have like a yellowy beige and then it
also has like the gray in it and I want
everything gray so obviously we're going
to keep these countertops so I'm going
to just do the white and I feel like
it'll really bring it up in here so this
room right to the side of the kitchen is
going to be our office it has nothing in
here yet we're probably going to do a
whole wall unit on this end we're
definitely getting rid of this like thin
wood that they have here probably a wall
unit
then like a nice desk a chair and maybe
take a little bookshelf on that side or
something like that we got our couch we
have to get everything else obviously
but I love the couch it's like a
beautiful gray color I got this from
it's called our house I love how it's
like wide cushions like that it's so
comfortable oh here's my eczema that I
was talking about you see it right here
so this was like probably double in size
so it's definitely going down but um you
could see it still here it's done I'm
hungry nothing likes some ramen noodles
we're actually low on them I'm gonna
order a few more Amazon geared is let's
bar this bad boy again it's the
MacDougall's and they come in like a big
case of them so pack of 6 is $10 I'm
gonna get three packs of six I love when
they offer Sunday delivery like yes
thank you very much I'll get a Sunday
delivery first bite on camera mmm I love
soup like there's nothing I love more I
feel like
huh oh they're the floating Kitty see hi
everyone I'm the star of the show I'm
nine pounds can you kiss me you want
sure you wouldn't kiss you either on
camera he's shy he's shy there you're
handsome today
she doesn't every day he's handsome
every day no let's show him how we fly
we say dad I just want to show off tell
mom she could do it she wants look how
big I want that burger - you want to go
get it then you're not going to be so
what if we go now
so Brep just got home from the gym he's
gonna go shower and then we're going to
go I think back to that vegan spot I
really go are we gonna go eat burgers
again I guess so we're not gonna go food
shopping anymore today we're gonna go
eat lunch at that vegan spot and we're
gonna go food shopping the morning so
I'm gonna take you guys with us to the
spot that way you could see the menu and
see some of the food because it's
amazing and then tomorrow morning we're
gonna go food shopping which I'll take
you guys take it up your brain but in
the window I want to see your Tukka so
so I will take you guys with us tomorrow
food shopping because I know a lot of
people have been asking what we've been
buying so we literally went there
yesterday and we told the people would
we bet we'd be back but who knew we'd be
coming back so soon oh it's in my eye
so yesterday I went to Pet Smart a no
Petco Pet Smart I don't know and I
picked up these little leashes they're
called
come with me kitties and we have um
like glass sliding doors with screens in
them and it's been so nice actually been
leaving the doors open with the screen
there obviously and a couple times we've
taken the cats out in our yard with us
and they're obsessed so any time I open
the door poor bear just sits by the door
and he's like cries because he wants to
go outside so I figured I don't want
them running around outside god forbid
they run away so I got these cool little
kitty leashes
so we'll see that'll be fun so the real
reason that I went to Petco was I had to
get a carrier because I had to take the
cats to the vet yesterday they have to
get neutered um but I went in and I
picked up another thing of these it's by
fresh pet and it's like a refrigerated
cat food I don't give them a lot of this
I'll either give it to them as a treat
or I'll put like a little bit on the
side with their food but they are
obsessed and they literally go crazy
over this like this is definitely their
favorite food that I give them so if you
guys want to try it out for your cat I'm
sure they will love them it's made with
chicken ocean white fish carrots eggs
and spinach yeah what are you doing are
you hanging out by mommy's feet
I'll play Eddie you're such a Russell
you're a tough rough got so big so
fluffy I just can't even stand it
anymore
kisses lean touch how nice tillage Tosh
so I changed my outfit feelin kind of
sporty so I have these little leggings

the striped shirt and then the shoes and
then a little bomber to throw over it so

you're gonna get a hot dog today
hopefully that I said they didn't have
it yesterday they didn't have it no he

people so we're going to head over to

groceries
there is a place I've been

guys so it is 10:00 after 6:00 we are
getting ready we're going out to dinner
tonight
it was my aunt and uncle's anniversary
last week so we were going out to
celebrate tonight so but I actually just
filmed what we picked up from the
grocery store so I know I showed you
guys like some of the things as we were
actually going but if you want to see
like a list of every single thing that
we did pick up you can click the link
right here and you can go check out in
his video so we were definitely
disappointed that the first place that
we went to was like way more expensive
than expected everyone always thinks
Whole Foods is the most expensive but
that definitely was way more expensive
than Whole Foods so luckily there is a
Whole Foods that's not too too far is
about 30 minutes from our house so it's
a little bit of a hike but we usually
just go once a month to Whole Foods so
it's not too bad to do it once a month
but right now we are getting ready to
leave this is what I'm wearing it's like
a suede jumpsuit and suede heels I don't
know if I want to wear the heels I took
a picture in them I was thinking about
wearing them but it's like a little wet
out and I don't know if I should so
we'll see but my hair needs to be washed
hence the ponytail and this is the same
makeup look that I did yesterday I'm
going to film this look because I saw
some people requesting it but yes we
were heading out the door now so I'm
gonna bring my camera so maybe we will
get some footage out tonight but see you

soup it has some beans vegetables what
is like a tomato base babe and then he
added a little bit of the diet cheese in
it it's so delicious

made some bread with garlic and the
Daiya cheese what kind of bread is this
