doubts you had hi guys thank you for
watching so I wonder if any of you went
Black Friday shopping yesterday I did a
little bit but I waited till about 4:00
or 5:00 p.m. to go because I couldn't
even think about waiting on those crazy
lines but if you all did I hope you all
made it out alive and got whatever deals
you could but if you guys didn't know
they have something called Cyber Monday
as well and for me that's like heaven
because it's about online shopping it's
kind of like a Black Friday for online
shopping apparently I've been living
under a rock for the past few years
because I've never heard about this
website and when I did it was just like
one of the coolest things I've ever
heard so I'm going to be opening up my
box that I got from them and I'm gonna
be sharing with you what the websites
all got so if you would like to learn
please keep watching the way that this
website works is you have two options
you can do a 2995 bag or you can do a
49.95 bag and basically what that means
is this website you can sign up for a
membership which it's gonna be every
month you can do this or you can just do
a one-time thing or you can do it
monthly like pay just do it separately
each month it's really cool is for cyber
monday instead of giving you two extra
items in your bag you're gonna get a
third item and for the 49.95 bag here
instead of getting the usual hundred
dollars worth of product you're gonna
get $150 and then for the 29.95 you're
gonna be getting $75 as opposed to the
$50 that you would normally get so it's
a really perfect time to go and try it
out if you haven't done it yet it's so
much fun when I did it I went on and I
picked out a purse which is a black bow
one which is gonna be in my box we can't
wait to see it so I did that and then I
think they gave me a pair of earrings
perfume and I believe a bracelet so what
you do is you go on and they give you a
whole nother sheet of all kinds of like
bags umm jewelry again you can just go
pick through whatever category and
what's so cool is you can go and you can
trade with people so say you don't like
something that the stylist picked out
for you you can go and say you like a
certain part
and it's around a similar price you can
just hit trade and then if that person
who has that item once your item you can
trade so once you get your items you are
allowed to trade on their website for
three to seven days depending on your
bag price and once you're done with that
they send it to you in a big white box
that looks like this
a little black bag in a big white box
every girl needs a little black bag I
agree so I've never done this before and
I'm really excited and I'm opening it
now on camera so you roll please okay
I'm gonna use this cuticle cutter
because I don't know this has been
sitting here and I've been waiting to
open it so I'm gonna show you what I
picked and what I traded with other
people
and then you need to go check it out for
yourself because serving to me I mean
this is a really big box right here
yeah this is what I originally purchase
so this was my original buy and then
they had given me okay so you ready to
see this this is the purse cute little
gold buckle I am obsessed with this it's
like perfect cuz it's bigger than a
clutch but it's not as big as a purse so
if you're going out or something it's
perfect I love the inside it's like a
houndstooth print I've been loving that
this year it also comes with this long
strap so you can just again use it over
the shoulder bag and yeah this was my
selection and I got it 70% off so I'm
pretty happy about that and so that's my
first item too cute
alright what up so this oh I got a nail
polish it's by Michael Marcus I love
this I forgot about this one yeah so
it's like just deep purple cranberry and
this color I'm loving for fall in the
video yesterday my lipstick was a
similar color to this so this one is
called monkeying around by Michael
Marcus cosmetics and love this
definitely gotta try it
that was one of the items I also traded
the next one is pretty pink provocateur
it's a light pink shimmer plumping lip
gloss I think this one was my fourth
extra gift and I kept this one I don't
want to treat it coz it's so pretty and
this is what it looks like and it's my
secret agent beauty and it's called
secret love affair and it's a really
pretty like a pink gloss a little
sparkle in it so yeah this was one of my
gifts so that was my third guest and now
this one gift this is another thing I
traded
that bag is hopefully as beautiful as it
looks on the website it's gray and it
has a chain and I love this it's black
inside and it has all kinds of pockets
it's nice and big and I don't have any
great purses so I saw this and I was
like I love this this is perfect to go
with sweaters and I have some gray over
the knee boots so yeah I mean for 4995
to get all that stuff I mean it's just
so cool and coolest part was going on in
like trading stuff because you'll see
something you like and you have to like
just pray and hope that that person will
want to trade it with you
I was probably on there for four hours
before I realize like how quick the time
was going so definitely go check out the
website it is so much fun and again with
Cyber Monday coming it's a perfect time
to try it because you're going to be
getting $150 worth of stuff or $75 for
this stuff so I hope you all enjoyed
thank you for watching me open my bag
and I can't wait to do it again next
month so if you guys want to see me open
my box again next week my box so if any
of you guys decide to sign up make a
response video I want to see what you
guys get I think one of the reasons that
I like this over other sites is because
I've seen different types where they
give you it's called like a mystery box
and they kind of just send you whatever
they want and then that's what you're
kind of stuck with but with this I love
it because they give you like they do
have suggestions for you but then you
can kind of trade with other people and
interact with other people and it's kind
of like a social media but for shopping
so here's Shopaholic and a beauty
addicts like me go check it out guys
alright thank you so much and enjoy
Cyber Monday
why did he pay I knew I was fine about
this time yesterday but I don't need ass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
