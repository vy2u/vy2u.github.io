so sorry I've been missing in action but
I promise I am back at it and I'm gonna
be filming as many videos as possible to
make up for some lost time I got back
from London on Sunday night and ever
since I've been back I've got sick so of
course between jetlag and getting sick I
just needed a couple days to myself so I
do apologize today I am back with a
Kylie Jenner inspired makeup and outfit
I wanted to do a Kylie Jenner inspired
look for quite some time now and when I
saw a look she had over the weekend I
just so happened to have the same outfit
in my wardrobe so I was like you know
what I used to always do celebrity looks
for less on my blog when I first started
out so I figured let me do a affordable
makeup look recreating the look that she
had as well as show you a similar outfit
option for I'm sure a lot less than what
she paid for it so if you guys want to
see how I got this celeb look for less
please keep watching to prime my face
I'm using my Maybelline the pore eraser
and this is just gonna mattify my skin
you'll see it instantly removes any of
my pores as well for foundation I'm
using also by Maybelline the fit me
foundation this is very comparable to
the Mac Studio Fix so I'm loving this
one
and then I'm blending in a little bit of
illuminator and I'm applying that all
over my face and blending in the
foundation with my damp Beauty Blender
to contour I'm using by la girl the pro
concealer in the color beautiful bronze
and I'm applying a little bit on my hand
first just to make sure there's not too
much product and I'm just gonna be
outlining wherever I want to apply the
cream contour on my face
I'm not gonna start pushing the product
into my skin I'm using this brush by Mac
and you just want to make sure it looks
like there's no lines we're gonna have
everything blend really seamlessly so
just take your time with this step
so I may have put a little bit too much
product on my forehead but it's totally
fine once I pressed it in a little bit
I'm grabbing a clean and larger
foundation brush and I'm just gonna
start smoothing it out just so it
lightens the darkness a little bit and
I'm also gonna be using the same brush
to blend in around my jawline and also
blend down onto my neck because remember
we want our necks to match your faces
to blend in my nose I'm just gonna be
using my fingers I always find that
blending with your fingers is gonna get
rid of a lot of the product so it's
gonna keep it looking very natural
kindly never really has too much of a
contour going on on her nose but I
wanted to make mine smaller so mine may
be a little bit darker than she would
have actually worn it
for concealer I'm using the dark circle
eraser this is one of my favorite
drugstore concealers
I love how pigmented it is and I'm
blending that in with my damn Beauty
Blender as well
I'm applying some loose translucent
powder just to set the concealer I'm
basically applying it everywhere that
the concealer was moving onto brows this
product that I'm using is very
affordable it's not from the drugstore
but it's really just my go-to favorite
one this one is the brow bar to go and
Kylie has a different shape
I rather than me so I tried making my
arch a little bit closer to the center
part of my eye like how she has it of
course I can't transform my eyebrows so
feel free to do it however you like with
this pressed foundation powder I'm just
applying that all over my highlights
just to kind of mute out the color and
just have it blend in with my eyes she
had a very natural look but I think
that's kind of signature for Kylie she
always says like the big eye is pretty
natural and nothing crazy on the eye is
the winged liner and then of course the
big matte lips I'm picking up this brown
shimmer shadow it's by L'Oreal and I'm
using a pencil brush to apply that on
the outer V of my eye I noticed there
was a little bit smoky she didn't post
many pictures so it's kind of hard to
see exactly what she was doing but I'm
just applying again a little bit on the
outer V and then with a larger blending
brush I'm blending a little bit of that
color into the crease
to really open up my eyes
so I'm also applying a little bit more
of this same exact color underneath my
lower lash line just to smoke it out a
little bit
next comes mascara and then I'm using a
black eyeliner to line the inner what
our line for lashes I'm using at the
Ardell whispies they're my go-to lash
they're super affordable plus they look
really natural and they just kind of
make your eyes look a little bit bigger
and to contour I'm using the new NYX
contour and highlight kit I just got it
last week and I actually really loved it
it's the third time maybe fourth time
that I've used it and so far so good so
if any of you guys are on a budget and
looking for a great kit the next one is
amazing
I believe I got it on Ulta website I
will definitely link everything for you
guys next I'm grabbing the Sonia Kashuk
bronzer and blush in one I'm using the
bronzer color to kind of Sheen up my
face a little bit it's a beautiful
bronze color and then the other side is
a perfect peach colored blush so I am
just applying that with the same brush
right on the apples of my cheeks for lip
liner I'm using I believe it's called
rock and rose by Jordana I will double
check it's the perfect dusty color and
I'm overlined my lips extreme in this
video just because I wanted to show you
how I would do it my lips are already
big but I know a lot of people want to
learn how to overdraw your lips like
Kylie Jenner does so I just wanted to
show you that you just kind of bite down
on your own lips and then extend the
line where it would normally be continue
to fill it in and what you can also do
is apply a light brown shadow with a
blending brush and apply that right
underneath your lower lip and it's gonna
give some shadows so again these are
just some little tips that I wanted to
share with you guys speak your lips look
nice and plump for some they may look
too big in this video but again I just
wanted to share some quick techniques
you make your lips look a little bit
extra plumped and then to highlight I am
using the lightest color in the next kit
and it actually came out gorgeous I love
the color of the highlight so this is
the final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video remember you don't need to go
out and spend so much money on these
high-end products you can get the exact
same look for less with some of the
products that I use in this video so I
hope you guys enjoyed and until next
time I'll see you guys later
detail afford shoes and soles of your
feet I've got blisters from running on
beaches and streets I've been locked
down now I've got eyes black inclu cuz
I'm a hit in the faith when I'm talking
to you know go lie down as soon as I
sleep your</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
