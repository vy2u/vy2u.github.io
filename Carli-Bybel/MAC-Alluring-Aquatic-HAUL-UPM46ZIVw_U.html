today's video I'm going to be doing a
Big Mac call yesterday I went to the
store closest to my house and there was
a new collection that launched and
everything was sold out online so I was
like I have to get to the store and try
out some of these new products I've
never actually been to a Mac store the
day of a product launch so it was pretty
intense I got there about 20 minutes
early and there was a line outside
luckily I was third in line and by the
time I actually got in they were saying
that everything's almost gone already
which is a little bit crazy because I
was there a half hour early third in
line and everything was already almost
gone so I thought when Mac has a launch
like this they have like hundreds of
products but obviously I was wrong the
lady in front of me was getting three of
everything and I didn't even get to see
the collection the lady looked at me and
she's like well what can I get you from
the collection before it's all gone and
I was like we'll take your time with
these two and then once you're done like
I'll come and I'll check it out and then
look and she was like no no it's going
really quick you have to just pick now
or you're not gonna get some of the
product so I was like oh well okay I'll
take that lipstick that lipstick this
this this this this and that and I
didn't get to try anything out in the
store so I actually have everything
still in the packaging I waited a whole
day to open it up just so I can actually
open it on camera
and I guess give you guys my first
impression reviews I'm sure some of you
are probably like why do you need any
more makeup and I understand why you
would think that and I don't think I
need any more makeup as well but I was
online and there was two high dimensions
skin finishes that they had launched
with this new line and I thought it was
gonna be exactly like Mac whisper of
guilt which is like a highlighter slash
illuminator and that one was limited
edition and I never got my hands on it
so I thought that this one was going to
be basically a duplicate of that so
that's why I wanted to try out the
products of course here I am in the
store and she's like rushing me what do
I need and I'm like oh no so I just
grabbed a whole bunch of crap I have a
pro card for Mac so I get a discount on
the product so basically Mac cost me
maybe a little bit more than the
drugstore so I do get a good deal on Mac
so don't think I'm crazy
which you probably already do crap
behind me but all right so let's get
into the haul the packaging for the new
collection is really cool it looks like
it's water it's like a turquoise with
little rain droplets all over it and
this collection is like the aquatic
collection I don't know it doesn't even
say it but so they all have the cool
packaging it's not the typical black
packaging the first one that I got was
Dell thick and the other one is
Aphrodite shell and like I said online
these looked like highlighters now in
person they look more like bronzers with
like a highlighter in it so I haven't
tried these out I'm gonna swatch them
for you guys and then we'll see how it
actually comes out but yes I was a
little disappointed I thought they were
highlighters and they're not but I still
picked them up and I actually got two of
the lighter shade and this is gonna be
included and the big giveaway that I
posted yesterday if you guys haven't
checked out that giveaway make sure to
check it out also beautycon is tomorrow
so for those of you attending in New
York City I will be there I should be
there around 12:00 and I'm just gonna be
walking around the whole place for about
two three hours I don't have a meet-up
or anything like that but I will be
there so if you guys see me please say
hello I would love love to meet you guys
yes back to the hall so this one is
Delphic and it's a little bit of a
darker shade and the other one is called
Aphrodite shell and as you can see it
has a shiny finish to it I would say
almost like a pearly finish and I'm just
gonna show you the swatches really quick
first I'm gonna show you the Delphic and
I dipped my finger in fix+ because
usually with these skin finishes I
always use either fix+ or the charged
water and here you can see it's just a
dark color and be perfect for bronzer
and the lighter color has more of a
pearly look to it I would recommend this
for someone with lighter skin tone as a
bronzer in the matte collection
sometimes they just repackage products
that they already have that's a popular
product that they just put in limited
edition packaging so this bronzer I do
have in the
Giller collection but I was running low
on it so I figured I'd pick it up it's
just the refined golden bronzer and has
a little bit of a shimmer to it but
again the packaging is so cool for this
it really looks like there's water on it
I picked up two extra dimension blushes
in the color see me here me and seduced
Etsy and these are really pretty they
look really shimmery this one's a little
bit more peachy colored and then this
one's a more pink finish and I'm gonna
swatch these two to see how they
actually come out first i'm swatching
seduced Etsy and this is a really pretty
peach finish and then i'm swatching see
me here me which is a little bit of a
bigger color and then since I forgot to
swatch the bronzer the golden we're fine
here's a quick swatch of that I picked
up the three lighter lipsticks that were
in the collection enchanted one pet me
please and siren song the casing though
like I only have maybe two three or four
ish limited-edition lipsticks or lemon
addition anything for that matter from
Mac but these are like these are cool
this is called siren song and it's very
aired doesn't it's not extremely
pigmented but it gives you a really
pretty shiny finish next i'm swatching
pet me please and this one is definitely
my favorite of the three it's a
beautiful purpley taupe shimmery color
and I absolutely love this one and the
last one is called enchanted one and
it's a really pretty nude pink ish color
it's very pigmented though and I love it
along with the lipsticks I picked up one
of the glosses this one is called peach
stock and I had to get it because if you
guys have seen most of my recent videos
my favorite nude lipstick is peach duck
by Mac and this one is my favorite for
when I'm tanner
it's just a nice nude color it's not too
light so it doesn't look white on your
lips but I actually realized that the
peach stock is a pro a Mac Pro color so
they don't sell it in the stores they
only have it under the pro card
action on the website but I'm pretty
sure you can find it on Amazon but this
lipgloss is amazing I love it so just a
few more items the last two things that
I picked up from that collection are
these two shadows in Lorelei and sea
worship and these are beautiful these
look so pigmented and really really
shiny Lorelei is more of a champagne
bronzy color and sea worship is like a
greenish gold color and let me test
these two out to see how beautiful they
look the other colors in the collection
I did like but I figured for it I spend
way too much money let me just get these
and try them out I figured I should be
good together
first i'm swatching Lorelei and this
would double as a highlighter I love the
pigments and the shininess of this and
the second one see warship is like a
goldish green and I also love how
pigmented this one is as well and last
thing that I picked up is from the new
movie Maleficent Maleficent Maleficent I
think that's right Maleficent the new
movie with Angelina Jolie her and those
cheekbones
I can't even but they had this also and
it's this beautiful red color
it's called true love's kiss and of
course I had to pick it up to try it out
but this is a beautiful red shade it's a
matte lipstick so that was my most
recent Mac haul I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I know a lot of the products
are unfortunately sold out but I don't
know if they restock it on the website
or I'm sure if you go in store somewhere
they probably still have some of these
laying around I would have to say
overall my favorite products would be
the lipsticks the lip gloss the two
eyeshadows and yeah I think that would
be it I mean the casing is beautiful the
two extra dimension bronzers are not
highlighters as I originally thought so
I'm a little disappointed in that but
they really are a beautiful finish you
can never go wrong with Mac
and I think every time I go in that
store no matter how much Mac I own I'll
always find something new that I have to
try out but yeah so that is it for now I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
until next time I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
