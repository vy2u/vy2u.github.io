it's been probably about a year and a
half I'd say since I've done a Mac haul
and I usually don't do these but I woke
up today and I didn't have any plan on
filming and I woke up and I was like you
know what how about I film another video
since I'm kind of on a roll lately so I
figured instead of doing the usual hair
or makeup tutorial I would show you guys
some products that I recently purchased
from Mac I love Mac that was my first
ever makeup brand that I became obsessed
with back I would say in middle school
probably like sixth grade um my mom used
to take me my sister to the mall where
we go and get our free makeovers and
then we have to buy $40 with the product
or whatever and that was like our little
bonding day so Mac has a special place
in my heart
um another thing I want to talk about is
this bandage on my hand really quick I
told you guys in a recent video that I
burned myself over a month ago and it
just won't heal and some of you guys saw
it in my last video and you're like hey
what is that on your hand so I figured
let me just cover it up because I've
been covering it up I just would take
off the bandage for the video so don't
mind it I'm not injured I'm totally okay
just recovering from a nice burn I'm
gonna take you guys through some of the
products I bought the last two times
that I went to Mac also I want to let
you guys know that I have a pro card
which means I get 40% off of Mac so I
kind of splurge a little bit more than I
should but it's like Walgreens prices
for Mac products can't really beat that
any of you guys didn't know about the
pro card if you go online you have to be
like a certified makeup artist
hairstylist or photographer or something
along those lines you have to just show
them your credentials and then you can
get proof for it and then you get sick
discounts so don't think I'm crazy with
all this I spent I got 40% off so it's
basically half off so it's basically
like drugstore products alright so if
you guys want to see some of the
products that I got please keep watching
oh oh
so first things first I went into the
MAC store um I wanted to try the Studio
Fix fluid foundation I have been so
against Mac foundations since middle
school literally because I used to use
them and every time I would hug somebody
or anything of the sort it would just
rub off on their clothing so I was just
always against Mac foundation so
recently when I went in the store I was
like I was like alright you know what
let me try it out let me see what all
the fuss is about I picked it up in the
color NC 20 and this color is what I
actually use for my foundation today
I've used this for about two weeks now
I'm honestly in love with it it has like
medium to fuller coverage it's very
thick how it comes out but I just
absolutely love it and I'm so shocked
because I hated it for so long but I
guess I was so young and I just didn't
know how to apply it correctly so that's
that but I ended up picking it up in MC
35 as well it's a little bit of a darker
tone um I haven't had a tan in quite
some time but when I do I'll probably
use that I also may get it in like NC 40
just because I get really dark sometimes
but I love the foundation I'm so
pleasantly surprised with it the next
thing that I picked up was my pro
longwear concealer this is my second
bottle unfortunately um it was probably
not even halfway used when I was away in
oolitic City for the weekends I brought
it with me and it fell in the bathroom
and it shattered everywhere and I was
like oh and then at that moment I
realized why the heck would they make
glass containers I mean yeah it looks
really nice but if you drop it you're
screwed so I mean maybe that's other way
to sell more I don't know but I really
love the concealer the pro longwear
concealer I have it in NC 20 and I also
have it in NC 15 the NC 15 is a little
bit more pinkish more like a cooler tone
and then this one's more of a yellow
tone so I prefer this one over the other
one even when I am fairly pale I love
applying this right underneath my eyes
and I've been blending it in with oh I
just got this brush recently it's the
Mac 132 I also have this band
in a mini version which is the one that
I've been using to apply the pro
longwear and I actually bought this one
online I thought it was the same one as
the little one but it came and it was a
lot bigger I love how it's like a dual
fiber brush
I love all the dual fiber brushes this
one's a little bit bigger so you can get
more surface area with it but I
absolutely love it you can tell it's
nice and dirty it needs a good cleaning
but so that's what I like to apply this
concealer with my most recent purchase
from Mac I got the two well I got two
colors of the full coverage foundation
these are brand new I haven't even tried
them yet I literally got them in the
mail maybe a week ago and when I was
doing my makeup tonight I was like I'm
gonna try the full coverage foundation
today so that way I can talk about it
more and I just went right for the
Studio Fix and completely forgot that I
said I wanted to use this so I haven't
tried it out yet so I will give you guys
an update when I do try this out maybe
I'll try it out in a video so I can
really see how it works but I'm excited
to try it looks really creamy and nice I
got in NC 20 and NC 35 the next two
products that I have recently got
honestly I have I could see myself in
the screen down here and this cast is
just ratchet um so I picked up these two
these were from I'm gonna say I don't
know there was like some sort of
collection that was going on but it is
um mineralized skinfinish --is this
one's called perfect topping which is so
freaking beautiful it matches my shirt
actually it's beautiful it would be used
for a highlighter of course and the
other one is lights cape I know they
have lights keep in the normal packaging
with like the normal smooth finish but I
didn't have it in my collection yet so I
figured try it out in the cool new print
that it has it's like really textured
I'll show you guys swatches of these of
course but they're so fun and I use the
light scape today for my highlight
from that same collection I picked up a
I shadow it's called spiritual life its
mineralized as well I haven't tried this
one out yet I just got it it's a really
pretty white I should use this hand
saying really pretty like white it was
like a gold iridescent finish on it so
pretty I love their mineralized
eyeshadows I usually don't use a ton of
Mac in my videos just because some
people can't find back and for some
people for most people Mac is pretty
expensive um so if you guys want to see
more Mac in my videos let me know I
always like to try and mix and match
with drugstore and higher end just so
anybody who tries it out can really
recreate my look so that's the main
reason why I don't use too much Mac in
my videos but I love this I'm going to
swatch it and show you guys and another
one that I recently picked up is a blush
it's a mineralized blush in the color
uplifting and this one I used once or
twice I love this blush the only thing
is if you don't like sparkly don't wear
it I put it on and I also applied in
highlighter and I went out and in my
room it looked completely fine it was
like a peachy beautiful color but when I
was driving I was looking in my rearview
mirror and my whole face was glitter it
was actually the day that I picked up my
little cousin for her birthday we went
shopping and she had glitter in her hair
because she had a competition the day
before and I was like did I get glitter
on my face from her hair I was so
confused but then I realized and had I
been this new blush and then when I use
it again I noticed the same thing
happened so I really do love it though
it's really sparkly and pretty it's
definitely a bold statement I wouldn't
really recommend it for everyday use but
if you guys are looking for something
with a pretty peach color and a nice
shimmery shine to it this blush is
awesome
so now let's move on to lip pencils I
have had a recent obsession with Mac lip
pencils my top favorites at the moment
are definitely whirl Oak stripped down
um uh what's it called
what are you cold what are you cool Oh
sore also morning coffee I believe it's
called but I recently picked up a couple
new ones the one that I'm actually
wearing today is called edge to edge and
it's a really beautiful purpley pink
color the next one is rosy rim these two
were featured in their new collection
every time I go on Mac they have like a
new collection um these were two of them
that I had to try out another one that I
got is nice and spicy and the other one
is called hover so I'll swatch all four
of them so you guys can see what they
look like next to each other
but i love them i swatch these two last
night and they're so beautiful that's
why i ended up using this one um for
today's makeup look and then for
lipsticks i have four recent ones that i
purchased the first one that I have is
honey love it is a matte lipstick and
it's like a beige pinkish nude I
absolutely love this one it's gorgeous
I'm so happy I picked this up I don't
think these ones are new I just have
been slowly building my matte collection
so I'm sure some of these have been
around forever and people love them
forever but they're just recent ones
that I picked up the next color is brave
it's a little similar to the honey love
it has more of a pinkish tone this one
isn't a matte though this one is called
satin but um it looks kind of matte
honestly but it's a little bit more of a
pinkish shade again with these I'm going
to swatch them so you can see them all
next to each other the next one that I
picked up is called blankety and this
one is also a nude pinkish beige um that
just seems to be my go-to look so when I
see a lipstick that is kind of the same
around the same shade I always go for it
I really love the finish of this one
this one is more similar to the honey
love
then brave but it is a gorgeous shiny
finish yeah this one is the amplified
collection and the final lipstick that I
got is the Miley Cyrus one she's a new
face of Max oh go Miley I personally
have some inside feelings for Miley that
I don't really shouldn't Express on
camera but I just I kind of Miss the old
Miley I don't I don't like the image
cheese for trying and I don't mean to
offend anybody but it makes me upset I
honestly get personally upset because
she's a role model to so many girls and
I just don't think that's a good person
for people to look up to Congrats to her
though for being the new face of Mack I
hope she gets everything together and
continues to make great music but we
shall see and the final two products
that I'm going to show you today are the
new Mac Toledo collection place and the
right the packaging though how cute is
the packaging they had a third color
that was more peachy and I wanted so bad
but of course it was sold out so I went
with the other two they're so cool cuz
they're like hombre blushes this pink
one is one I'm using right now um to be
honest I think Mac people just are
suckers for packaging this is the other
one by the way it's more like a purple
should use this one in matches um so for
me to be honest I have so many blushes
did I need more blushes no but they came
in white cool packaging so I mean that's
of course why did why I needed them you
know so that is really it for my last
couple of Mac hauls I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if it wasn't too
boring for you some of the newer
products that I haven't tried yet if you
guys want to see in tutorials let me
know maybe I could do like a full face
of first impressions or something like
that um yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed
I love you so much I have some more
videos coming for you this week so stay
tuned and until next time I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
