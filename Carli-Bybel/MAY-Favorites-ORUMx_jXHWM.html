June is finally here so that means it's
time for my may favorites before I get
into today's video I just wanted to make
an announcement really quick on June
14th from 1 to 3 p.m. I will be at the
Sigma Store at Mall of America in
Minnesota so I'm so excited for that I
cannot wait to meet some of you guys so
I'm counting down the days and I hope
some of you guys will be able to make it
I will be posting more details and I
will give you guys the link to the Sigma
blog so you guys can hear more about the
event but I also wanted to let you guys
know for anyone that will be able to
attend I will be having to brush kits
for sale that day only in store only is
not available online or anywhere else so
for those of you that do decide to come
and are looking to purchase brushes the
way that this event is going to work is
a little bit different than I guess
events that they've held in the past
apparently they've had a bunch of other
girls come there and when they did it
was like a mob scene there was people
like pushed up against the glass and I
don't know I heard some crazy stories so
what Sigma decided to do this time
around is they're going to have online
ticket sales for this event and they're
not tickets so you're not just paying
$15 to come and meet me what it is is
going to be like a coupon to get into
the event so what this is going to do
it's going to guarantee your spot at the
event to meet me because apparently also
there are people waiting for hours and
then never ended up getting to meet the
person that was there and I don't want
that to happen so all you do is you pay
$15 for the VIP pass but what that $15
is going to give you is a ticket to the
event also if you decide to buy anything
that day it's going to be a coupon for
$15 off of your order but if you guys
did not want to purchase anything in the
store that is completely fine as well if
you guys want to just come meet me hug
me take some pictures that is great what
the VIP pass will be for those people
will be when you come in you'll get a
free eyeshadow brush of your choice so
technically you're not paying for
anything it's just a pass to lock in
your spot to get in there so you guys do
want to attend I will be listing all the
info below as well as at my blog and
some other info that maybe I didn't
cover in this video but I'm so excited
to go and I'm so excited to meet some of
you guys because it's an area that I've
never been before so I feel like I'm
going to
see a lot of new faces but yeah so that
is the big news and I'm super excited
about but now let's move on to my
favorites to start off today's favorites
video I'm gonna be talking about the
Armani luminous self foundation I just
picked this up last month I've been
going back and forth between this and
the Chanel foundation also the Beauty
Blender I've had this for a while now
but I actually never even knew how to
use it I didn't even realize that
they're supposed to be used wet which I
guess that's the number one thing you're
supposed to do with the Beauty Blender
so last month I'm going to say was when
I realized how to actually use it and
now I've been using it every single time
I apply my foundation I like to mix a
foundation along with an illuminizer use
my Beauty Blender and that's how I've
been doing my foundation and I've really
seen a great difference so luminous silk
I would say is very similar to the
Chanel they are both pretty pricey but
I've seen this used everywhere and I
wanted to try it out and I've been a
huge fan of it this is actually what I
use today for my foundation a new primer
that I've been using almost every single
day is by Kiko cosmetics this one is
called perfect morning and it's a
Awakening toning serum and the reason I
like this is because it has like a shiny
consistency so when you put it on your
face not only is a great primer for your
makeup but it has like a nice glowing
look to start off your foundation so
this I picked up from Garden State Plaza
I still don't think that they have an
online store in the US for Kiko I will
double-check for you guys I don't know
what's been up with my skin lately but
I've had a lot more breakouts than usual
I'm not sure if I mentioned this in
another favourites video but this works
miracles I apply my silicic acid on my
pimples and then I apply this before I
use my foundation and it's really
helping clear my pimples so this has
been my Holy Grail product of May and
until the beginning of June because I
keep breaking out another concealer that
I've been loving lately is the Tarte
creaseless concealer this is any color
light/medium and I really love this
consistency of the concealer I have
always used the Laura Mercier which is
more of a like a sticker consistency I
was never really a fan of the liquid
concealers but this one has really great
coverage and I always tend
see myself grabbing for this one over my
laura mercier which is crazy because if
you guys know me you know that's been
the only concealer that I've loved
forever now another one of my favorites
from the past month is the NARS
translucent powder in crystal and it's a
really beautiful white shimmery
finishing powder and I like to apply
this over my concealer I always switch
off between powder sometimes I use a
loose powder sometimes I use the contour
kit I use all different kinds of powders
but this one is really brightening so I
like to use this right underneath my
concealer that way I'm not adding color
to my concealer because sometimes when
you add a loose powder with some color
it can darken up the spots that you
highlighted so I found this works really
really well and it's a nice bright
highlighting finishing powder this
product I've had for a while now I just
never actually used it I haven't been a
fan of eyebrow pencils for a while when
I actually first started filling in my
brows I would always use a pencil and
then when I had to keep Reeb eyeing it
like every two three weeks because they
would run out I was like you know what
I'm gonna switch over to powder that
sounds like a better option but recently
I've been using this brow Wiz and I love
it because it's double-sided it has the
comb on one side and then it's like a
pencil on the other I'll use this when I
want to do a more natural look for my
whole makeup look or just for my
eyebrows the pomade is amazing and I
love it for a full face makeup look but
when I'm doing something super natural
if you don't want a big black sharpie
eyebrows so this is gonna give you a
really natural look to your brows and
it's just gonna very lightly fill in the
spots that needed to be filled in so
this I've been using a ton lately I know
with the summer coming up this is gonna
be my go-to product just because I
always love to fill in my brows a little
bit even if I don't really have any
makeup on that's like the one thing I
need our brows oh her brows and
eyelashes so or mascara definitely one
of my favorites of May and I know I'll
be using this a ton in the summer so I'm
gonna say for about two years now I've
been using that Olay brush cleanser for
my face and I've always loved it I never
had any problems with it but I've seen
so many good reviews on the Clarisonic
and I don't know what's taking me this
long but I had to try it out and I
finally caved in and bought it this one
I got from Sephora online and I got the
one of the little
print on it because it was so cute but I
really really like this I've been using
this for the past two weeks and it's
definitely different in the fact that it
doesn't revolve when you're cleaning
like the Olay won but it vibrates and it
has the brush on it and I really love it
like I said I've been breaking out a lot
recently so this is really gonna be deep
cleaning my skin and so far so good
things you have a couple different
versions of this I don't really know
what the difference is of them but this
one I absolutely love so the next
product I'm going to talk about is by
Evian and it's a facial spray and I'm
gonna read you what it's for
you can use it year-round it's a facial
spray that hydrates your skin it helps
fix your makeup and it freshens and
purifies your face so basically this is
heaven in a bottle I know I will be
using this all summer but I've been
using this a ton for the past two months
actually last month I've been using it a
lot but just shake it up and it just
just a really nice refreshing spray for
your face this is great for those of you
in warmer climates like here in New
Jersey it's been like 96 degrees which
is just madness but it's great to bring
with you to the beach or just to carry
with you in your purse that way if you
wear makeup like me and you need a nice
little refresher throughout the day you
just spray a little bit on your face and
just watch how amazing it feels on your
skin the last two products I'm gonna
talk about are the perfumes that I'm
using at the moment this one is called
fancy by Jessica Simpson this I believe
I got at Walgreens and the other one is
Michael Kors and it's called glam
jasmine this one I got as a gift about
two weeks ago and I'm loving this and
they both smells so amazing this is a
little bit less strong so I always like
to keep this in my purse with me that
way whenever I'm on the go just open it
up give myself a little spritz and then
smell and fresh so that is it for my
favourites of May I'm sorry it was a
little bit shorter but I just wanted to
include some of my absolute favorites
for the month remember if you guys are
in the Minnesota area on June 14th I
will be there at the Sigma Store and I
really hope to meet some of you guys I
will again list all details below so you
guys can sign up for your VIP ticket so
that way
we can meet I love you guys so much and
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
