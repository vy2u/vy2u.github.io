today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this copper makeup look so
although there is still snow on the
ground here at New Jersey it is
technically spring which I am so excited
about so if you guys want to see how I
got this look right here and then please
keep watching to start off today's look
I'm using the urban decay and Kristin
leanne daydream eyeshadow palette I'm
first picking up the color daydream with
my Sigma e-40 brush and I'm blending
that right into my crease
next I'm picking up the color subscribe
and I'm applying that right below the
lighter shade in my crease as well so
since I'm going to be going in with a
darker copper shade in a minute I just
want to add some dimension that way it
fades nicely and you don't have to do as
much work later on so next up I'm
grabbing the anasazi of Beverly Hills
prism palette and I'm picking up the
color Saturn also with my large blending
brush and I'm going to start blending
that into the lighter brown shades I'm
gonna start working that down almost on
my lid and then blending it upwards I
want to keep most of the color down here
on my lid at first and then we can start
blending it up that way the color
doesn't go too far up towards your brow
so I just like to use a little bit at a
time and work the color in
I'm then grabbing my Sigma e25 and that
same Saturn shade and I'm dipping it
into a setting spray and I'm going to
blend that right into the outer V just
to give it a little bit more pigment
and then wiping off my larger brush and
I'm just going to very very lightly
blend everything together I'm then
picking up a little bit of the color
parallel and that is also going to go on
my outer-v
with my finger I'm grabbing the color
eternal and I'm just going to apply that
right on to my lid
I'm grabbing a little bit of the color
Vegas lights by makeup geek it's a
pigment and I'm gonna apply that right
over it because I really want the copper
to be super super bright so I'm just
gonna go back in with my blending brush
and very lightly blend the color Saturn
into my crease and just give it a little
bit more of a faded look with the color
eternal I'm gonna apply that right into
my tear duct because I couldn't really
reach it with my finger
for eyeliner I'm using the tortise
eyeliner I'm using the felt tip side to
highlight in my tear duct and also under
my brow I'm using the I'm resi
highlighter by anastasia beverly hills
and for my lower lash line I'm using a
pencil brush and the eternal shadow and
I'm gonna push that up really close to
my lash line I'm also going to use a
bronze eyeliner for inside of my eye in
a minute and then right underneath that
color I'm gonna apply Saturn where my
inner lower lash line I'm using the
color show me by color pot and since I
do have lash extensions I'm just gonna
be using my buxom mascara so I actually
just found this reddish copper eye
pencil called opulence by zoeva and it's
a little bit closer to my eyeshadow
color so I'm going to add this on my
lower lash line on top of the other one
for lip liner I'm using the color Sienna
by Joey
and for lipstick I'm using Lolita by Kat
Von D
I'm also going to mix a little bit of
Hudson by uh Nastasia Beverly Hills I'm
going to grab this highlight shade from
my palette and I'm going to apply a
little bit on my lips to give it like a
metallic look and a little bit of this
color as well
and I'm going to take a little bit of
this bite lip mask and apply that to
highlight my nose I'm gonna take the
amrezy highlighter and apply it this
highlighter so pretty I love it because
this is my first spring look I'm gonna
apply a little bit of highlighter
line-ups
cyber ends now
and I'm applying this before I do
bronzer and blush that way I can kind of
tone it down a little bit so to bronze
up my face I'm using my shade and light
palette
then I'm grabbing the Natasha de Nonna
citrus highlight palette and I'm going
to start off with a little bit of this
glow cream highlight and when you use my
Beauty Blender and I'm going to apply it
right on my cheeks
and then gonna grab the powder blush
and I'm gonna take a little bit of this
highlighter and just highlight my chest
a little bit collarbone shoulders and
she finished off this look I'm going to
use my lavender facial spray
this is the final result I hope you guys
