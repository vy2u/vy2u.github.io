off the plane
every time I see the city through the
pounds I get that way call me crazy for
missing you like this but I do hi
everybody thank you for watching I'm
back with my second video in my color
series today I'm gonna be talking about
all my favorite Mint products so I was
going through a bunch of the comments on
my last video and I was so excited to
hear that you guys did love this idea I
am going to be adding in some fashion
along with the beauty products and all
that good stuff because I saw a time of
you guys requesting what would you wear
with a certain color or how could you
pair a certain color so I'm gonna be
going through everything from beauty
tips some fashion tips some of my
favorite products and I'm going to teach
you how i got this makeup look as well
if you guys want to hear some of my
favorite products and learn how to get
this makeup look please keep watching so
just like last time i had to of course
put on my cell phone case that matched
the trend this one has a few mint
colored flowers in it i think I got this
on Amazon so I will link this for you
guys so the first product I want to talk
about today is my new Lime Crime
lipstick in the color meant to be I
literally just got this in the mail
today and I was so excited because it
was perfect timing
these lime crime lipsticks are super
pigmented I have a bunch of other colors
but I had to get the mint one since this
bad boy looks like a lipstick I'm gonna
talk about him next and this is actually
a color correcting concealer this one is
by Maybelline and it's called cover
stick corrector concealer and you can
just get this at any drugstore and I
wanted to mention this one because I'm
sure some of you guys have seen colored
concealers and you're not sure what
they're used for this green color
cancels out the redness in your face so
if you have a pimple or if you just have
some red spots use a green concealer
underneath your foundation and watch how
it just evens out your skin tone
the next mint product that I have is by
BH Cosmetics and this is in the color
fresh it's a beautiful mint color and
this is actually what I use underneath
my eyes I was also debating between
doing this makeup look that I chose or
just doing like a black line and then
mints liner over it I did do a video
similar to that with a green emerald
line so I will link that below if you
guys want to maybe try it out with a
mint line I think it would look really
really cool and it's just a way to add a
pop of color the next product is also by
Maybelline this is a color tattoo and
these are used as eyeshadow bases so if
you are doing a mint green color on the
lid I would definitely recommend using
this as the base that way it's gonna
help really bring out the color of the
shadow and give it the most pigmented
mint color possible I have these in a
few other colors and I definitely do use
these for eye shadow bases I think the
white one is the one that I use the most
but I did have this one as well so how
to include it of course a little while
back at my PO Box I got this amazing box
from a girl from South Korea and she
included all kinds of beauty products a
beautiful note and all kinds of awesome
things but included in that was this
little macaroon chapstick like I've
never seen these around here but they
are so cute and it literally smells like
kind of like lime no cucumber melon
melon why it's like cucumber melon e ish
flavored but I love this I use this one
all the time as well I flopped between
the EOS this one and I have a couple
other brands that I have all in my draw
but this one smells so amazing and I'm
so grateful that I got my hands on this
because I'm not sure if they sell them
in America yet but I will definitely
check for you guys and if so I will post
on my blog along with everything else
moving on to some eyeshadows I have this
quad also by Maybelline in the color
gutsy green and there is a few different
color greens in here but I use the mint
color for this tutorial look actually I
applied this shadow right over the gel
mint liner that I had from BH and this
color is so pigmented I have about five
or six of these little palettes and they
really are great shadows if you guys are
looking to go pick something up quick
you can just go run to your drugstore
and get these but again yeah there's
super pigmented and I love this little
palette next up by L'Oreal I have the h
IP studio secrets crystal shot
and this one is in mystical and it's a
really pretty mint color and I like
these because they always come with two
shadows so they give you an idea of what
colors they recommend to pair together
when using these colors another great
mint shadow is the comet also the
meteors pretty minty colored as well but
these are from my galaxy chic palette
and these are amazing BH as usual as
super affordable and I love their
shadows also by BH the eyes and the 70
palette which I mentioned in my last
video it has a beautiful mint color as
well right here
so for mint nail polishes I have four
favorites I actually painted my nails
before this video and I use the color
minted by Revlon so that is what I have
on a few of my fingers which I'll show
you guys a close up right now these are
my funky nails and they were inspired by
this new top that I just got actually
today in the mail as well from misguided
I new mins how to be the next color just
because I got my two shipments and today
another one that I picked up recently
was by Sally Hansen and color foil and
this one's a really shiny cool finish so
it sounds a little bit different the
third one is by Victoria's Secret and
the color lucky and the fourth one is my
Sen it's called first timer and then
last but not least I'm going to talk
about my favorite orbit flavor this one
is in sweet mint and this has been my
favorite gum for like I don't know 10
years now it's really the only one I
ever get I just like the sweet mint
flavor so that is it for my men products
next I'm gonna talk a little bit about
mint in fashion what I would recommend
pairing it with how I've worn it in the
past and then after that we're gonna get
on to the makeup look there are a few
ways that I would pair mint I was
looking back at some of my older posts
to see if I had worn a few outfits
involving the mint color and of course I
did two of the outfits that I found were
a mixture of mint black and white and I
think when you do something with a black
and white it's always cool to add some
sort of pop of color whether it be red
or pink or mint in this case I'm going
to show you two pictures one here and
one here so as you can see this is how I
decided to pair these two looks the
first one that I have here is from when
we went to Punta Cana for Valentine's
Day I wore black and white polka dot
shorts along with my mint cami and then
I had a necklace that I got from art and
B it was last year so I don't think it's
in stock anymore but it had the mint and
in the black and white beads on it so
that's what really inspired the whole
outfit I also picked up this thin mint
belt from forever 21 I loved getting all
my little belts from there because
they're super affordable and it's O
cool to have annexed matching belt with
your outfit the other outfit that I wore
here was what I wore out one night to a
bar slash club I wore a pair of leather
pants
I had a mint top from forever 21 with
that I decided to pair it with a black
and white blazer so with this outfit I
decided to pair it with this big mint
duffel bag that I have that's actually
up on my closet so of course also you
can wear mint along with other colors
not just the black and white I just
think those three colors really blend
nicely together as you can see on my
shirt I have some pinks and purples and
all the pastels are perfect for spring
and summer times so if you want to mix
some pastels that's awesome as well so
those were the two outfits that I had
pictures of that I put together that had
meant obviously I like how the mint
black and white looks together but on my
blog I'm going to post a couple
different options and a couple different
available men outfits that I would
recommend how I would also pair it
together and yeah I think that's it as
far as products fashion beauty now let's
move on to this makeup look to start
this look off I'm just applying a little
bit of concealer on my eyelids picking
up a white shadow from my BH 180 palette
I'm just applying this on the inner part
of my eye
picking up a fuchsia color from the same
palette I'm then gonna be applying this
color right on the outer part of my eye
and then very lightly dragging it into
the middle blending the two colors
together picking up a light brown shadow
I'm then blending this right into the
crease of my eye next I'm just applying
my eyeliner feel free to apply it
however you like it the best for your
eye shape after that I applied my
mascara and my false lashes and
underneath my eye I'm using my mint
eyeliner by BH and I'm just drawing the
line
to increase the mint color I'm going
right over that with this mint shadow
for my Maybelline quad I'm applying a
light pink blush and then I'm using a
little bit of a highlighter these are
both from the urban decay highlighter
and blush palette
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video definitely
