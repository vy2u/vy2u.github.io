today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this look right here which is the
exact makeup look I wore for my birthday
a few weeks ago I figured since I do it
every year I would show you how I wore
my makeup for my birthday when we went
out with my friends and I'm also gonna
show you guys the full holiday
collection which launches tomorrow
morning so I'm so excited for today's
video I can't wait to show you
everything and I just wanted to say
thank you so much to everyone who
purchased something for my first drop
you guys look unbelievably amazing and
thank you for tagging in the photos it's
honestly so unreal getting to see you
guys wearing my pieces and it's a dream
come true so thank you guys so much and
if you want to see how I got this look
right here as well as the second drop
which is my holiday collection then
please keep watching to start off
today's look I'm using the Too Faced
just peachy matte palette with my Sigma
e-40 I'm picking up the color peach
punch and I'm applying that right into
my crease
hang up the color peach meringue with my
Sigma f7d I'm going to be applying that
on my lid and also under my brow
with my morphe m-43 3 i'm picking up the
color peach sangria and i'm going to be
applying that right in the outer V of my
eye
following that I'm picking up the color
just right with the same brush and I'm
just gonna darken that out or be a
little bit more picking up the color
peach punch I'm just going to apply a
little bit of that right in the middle
part of my eyelid with my em cosmetics
eyeliner I'm just gonna be aligning my
upper lash line as I always do
with my Sigma e30 I'm picking up the
color peach punch and I'm applying that
on my lower lash line then I'm going to
be mixing the color just ripe and peach
sangria and apply that on the outer half
and blend it into the pink shade with my
Sigma F 70 brush I'm picking up this
shade right here in my palette and I'm
applying that on the lid I wanted to add
a little bit of shimmer then picking up
this gold highlight shade from my
palette I'm gonna be highlighting under
my brow and also in my tear duct and I'm
also gonna be highlighting my nose with
that same color a little here as well as
I always do I'm just gonna apply a
little bit of loose powder under my eyes
and then I'm gonna apply my bottom
mascara and the reason I do this is so
the bottom of Scour doesn't get all
underneath my eyes
so I'm sort of wipe away the powder
underneath my eyes and I'm gonna use the
mill shade from my cap on see pellet and
when I brought up my face my darkest
shades shattered when I dropped the
other day so I'm gonna have to buy a new
one but it's okay but I'm gonna use
these two anyway it's a bronze up my
face for blush I'm using this shade
right here for my BH nude blush palette
so I know my birthday was like almost a
month ago but I really wanted to film
this look because I love to do my
birthday looks every year for you guys
and I really loved my makeup this year
for my birthday so I finally getting
around to filming it plus the pants that
I wore for my birthday are gonna be
released tomorrow so I figured I would
make this like a mega tutorial plus the
holiday collection reveal for my
misguided collection as well so that way
you guys can get a little bit of both I
know I've been a little bit slow on
YouTube I've had a lot going on as I'm
sure most of you guys have noticed I'm
not ignoring you guys I just when I'm
ready I will talk to you so that's all
I'm gonna say but some highlight my
cheeks and my chest a little bit I'm
going to use the same gold shade from my
highlighter from my palette I mean not
from my highlighter and I'm just using
the anasazi a highlight brush so I'm
just gonna apply that like on all the
high points I got my collarbone on my
shoulders I always like to do this when
I'm doing like a full face look cuz it
just adds a little bit more shimmer and
I'm gonna do a little bit on my cheeks
and the lip combo that I have been using
for the past couple of months I'm not
able to use it in today's video it's
something that I've been working on so
I'm gonna do something kind of similar
just like a nude look so let me go find
something similar to what I've really
been using and that will be revealed
obviously as soon as possible so I'm
gonna use the bow and arrow lipliner my
Kat Von D and I literally just got back
from Nashville at like 9:30 this morning
I went to the CMAs which was amazing so
I did a vlog it which I will be posting
next week as well as my vlog from my
pop-up shop so it was such an amazing
time we got in on Tuesday night a little
bit late our flight was delayed and then
the scenes were yesterday and then today
we had a 6:00 a.m. flight home
originally we were supposed to come home
at like a normal time but I realized I
didn't get my collection video up so I
switched my flight to super early and
now Here I am today filming it for you
guys so for lipstick I'm going to use
the color posh by Mello cosmetics I do
have a coupon code for this company
which I will list below for you guys
and then to set my makeup I've been
using the final seal by Ben Nye it
smells really weird but it works really
really well so I'm just gonna spray a
little bit of this all over my face
it smells like like minty almost but
yeah so that is how I did my makeup I'm
gonna just fix my hair a little bit it's
still curled from the CMEs yesterday I
didn't even brush it out so that's why I
guess it's still curled I finally
brushed it today so it's pretty similar
to how I did it for my birthday
this is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this makeup look so I'm going to
show you guys my full outfit right now
and then I'm gonna go through and show
you guys the pieces from my new
collection so I hope you guys enjoyed
thank you so much for watching I can't
wait to see you guys in all of the new
pieces and until next time I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
