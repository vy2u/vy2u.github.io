closet 281 join me my girl hi everybody
thank you for watching so today I am
standing in my closet so I know this
video has been requested ever since I
moved in almost two and a half years ago
and it wasn't that I didn't want to film
it it's just I still never really
finished it and as some of you guys know
I don't trust me up there with the
candle Hey
so it's not that I didn't want to film
this video it's just I never really
finished it and now I am getting ready
to move so go figure but I figured I'd
show it to you guys before I move and if
you guys want to see like a little house
tour or something like that I can
definitely do that for you guys even
though I am moving um just to give you
maybe some decorating advice and all
that so before I give you the tour of
this crazy closet of mine I'm gonna give
you a little bit of a backstory for
those of you guys maybe that are new or
that don't know me I moved into this
house December of 2015 about two and a
half years ago and when I found this
house I instantly fell in love at the
time I thought it would be my forever
home so there was a lot of aspects of
this house that I saw myself growing
into and I just fell in love with every
little bit of it and I really did so
much to this house to really make it my
own so as soon as I am leaving it I am
looking forward to the new chapter in my
life I'm excited for my new place that
I'm moving into I'm gonna make it just
as beautiful but it's gonna be a little
bit of a mini aversion because it's just
gonna be all me so when I was looking
for houses probably around three years
ago I started looking there was a lot of
things that I knew that I wanted in the
house and I was kind of back and forth
between building one from scratch or
just kind of finding one and then making
it my own when I first came into this
house like I instantly knew it was gonna
be mine once I saw the master wing of
this house I was like
someone built this house and they built
it for me so when you see my closet
understand that this is all a part of
the master wing so I have my master
bedroom I have my master bath and then I
have the entrance to my closet so when I
first moved in this area right here was
their master closet they had it was all
carpeted and they had like these brown
units I don't even think it was real
wood in here and then my shoe closet as
you guys can kind of see right now which
again you'll see it all in a minute it
was just like a little doorway and then
they had my shoe closet was actually
like an office so it was like a hidden
office up in the master wing and then
the other section of my closet they had
as just like an empty sitting room with
like a couch and it was completely empty
so when I walked in here the first thing
that I said was okay obviously this is
like three closets in one and you can't
make any of these a bedroom because
they're all attached to the master wing
and there's no access to get to the rest
of the house so it didn't really make
sense to be anything other than three
big closets so I knocked down the doors
I added big entryways that way it's all
kind of like one so yes my closet is
huge I saw it as an opportunity to make
the closet of my dreams and I know one
day when I build my new home I will have
something probably similar so obviously
it's excessive it's huge I have so many
clothes but this is my sanctuary and I
just love like being in here and just
being like huh so I got to design this
closet from top to bottom so every
little detail means a lot to me and I'm
excited to share it with you guys I'm
sure a lot of you guys are like oh my
god are you so sad leaving it honestly
no I'm not sad leaving it obviously it's
beautiful and I worked really hard to
get here but I'm also really excited for
the new chapter in my life and the
closet can be built anywhere so remember
that materialistic things although they
are fun and it's fun to be a part of
materialistic things do not define who
you are so although I do have
a lot of stuff there are way more
important things in life than clothes
and shoes and jewelry and all that so
with all of that said let's get into the
closet or
so I tried to color-code everything as
best as possible on this side it's a
little bit of a shorter unit because the
way that my ceiling comes down you can
see like right here on this side I have
all of my pants and up here I have all
of my body suits and also tank tops
without sleeves and then right below
that I have crop tops just like simple
basic types of tops so on the top
section I have all my long sleeve tops
that are more of the pastel colors and
then down below I have my darker colors
which then we're gonna move on to the
darker side of my closet so again over
here same thing we have my pants all
hanging there and then I have body suits
and sleeveless shirts right here and
then below it I have my cropped shirts
as well and then I had these little
pointy toed shoes in a lot of the colors
that the shirts were so I thought it
looks nice to just have them kind of
spread out right there this unit goes
all the way up to the ceiling as you
guys can see so on this side I have all
my jackets I have the black at the
bottom and the colored ones on top I
don't know if you guys can see but like
it's tiered so like here and here this
one goes up a little bit higher and the
middle one goes up a little bit higher
as well so underneath the jackets over
here I have dresses t-shirt dresses
rompers anything that's a little bit
longer that wouldn't have fit above
where the jackets are in the middle
section I have some sweatshirts and then
we're moving on to the white items and
then over here I have again jackets I
have below it
some rompers t-shirt dresses dresses all
kind of mixed in in color order and on
this side I have jackets and my jean
jackets all over here as well so that is
this side of the closet and then my shoe
closet was just like a little door so I
had that opened up that way it all
became one
so it would look we have little Cindy
Cindy what are you doing my girl oh I
didn't turn my shoe closet on this right
here actually pulls out and it's an
ironing board so if I need to iron
anything that's a cool little feature
that we added in that just slides right
away and then you could shut up and it
looks like a regular drawer so this is
my shoe closet you guys saw it from my
video where I organized everything so
now moving on to my other part of the
closet so again this right here
it was another doorway with an actual
door I had it opened up because it was
just unused space and honestly I don't
know what else they would have used this
room for that's why I felt when I moved
here that this closet was like made for
me because I have a lot of stuff if you
guys can't tell already so now this is
the other part of my closet this whole
unit right here it's all drawers so I
have bathing suits I have sweatpants I
have matching separates like leggings I
have a bunch of stuff in those drawers
but I'm gonna type of girl that likes to
hang everything so some of the drawers
aren't even completely full I feel like
if I don't see it I'll never wear it
which I mean am I ever really gonna wear
everything anyway no probably not
and then over here I have some more
hanging I have the lights to the darks
again that's kind of the vibe I tried
sticking with so I have all my skirts
shorts like nice shorts I have jean
shorts just center drawer but I have all
of that there then I have my crop tops
and then I have the darker skirt shorts
all of that viewing this from another
angle I have these little purse racks
over here I have my really long hanging
in those mirrored closets right here so
then viewing it from this other side I
have my little sitting area with Bowie's
little tush on there so over here I have
like some jeans and all of that hanging
this red jumpsuit is literally life so I
had to keep it out on display so it's
super funny because when I built this
like here I'll show you guys look
short I can't even see into this mirror
if I wanted to like I was like okay well
I guess I will never be using that
mirror which is fine I don't need
another mirror I also have out on
display my little hundred thousand
subscribers from you two how cute I love
it but yeah here I just have my jewelry
like my favorite gold necklaces silver
necklaces hanging and then over here I
have some sneakers so I have like wires
hanging out of my ass so in here it's
kind of they're all I have these shelves
up here where I keep my luggage and then
just long hanging so basically anything
that's super super long fits in there
really nicely Cindy we don't want you to
get stuck I saw her every time I open
this I have to make sure none of the
cats are in there because I love to just
like jump in there and like play around
and it's like my biggest fear is like
locking them in an area of my closet I
swear she loves the closet more than me
every time I'm in here she's like
following me around you trying on all my
clothes without me looking is that what
you do when mommy's not home so I hope
you guys enjoyed this little preview to
my crazy closet to be honest I'm not
looking forward to packing all of this
up and starting over but I wanted to
share it with you guys before I move
because I know a lot of you were
requesting it so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you guys want a house tour
before I move out I can do that for you
guys as well I wasn't really comfortable
doing it while I was living here because
of privacy reasons I have had people
show up at my house multiple times and
it's just really uncomfortable so I
wanted to kind of keep it private but
now that I am moving I don't mind
showing it's you guys showing some of
the rooms that I decorated I really
didn't ever finish this house I knew I
was going to be moving for probably
about a year so I kind of stopped so I
kind of just liked it as much as I could
and then I really kind of gave up but I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching
until next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
