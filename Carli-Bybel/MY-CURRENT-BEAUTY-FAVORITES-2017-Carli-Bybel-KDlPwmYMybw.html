today's video I'm going to be talking
about some of my favorite products from
the past few months I feel like it's
been quite a while since I have done a
favorites video so I wanted to update
you on some of the products that I've
been loving so today I want to hear what
they are then please keep watching the
first pot that I wanted to talk about is
something that I've been working on for
well over a year now this was originally
planned to launch for holidays last year
and I just kept pushing it back because
I really realized it to be absolutely
perfect so those of you guys who don't
know what I'm talking about I am
launching a new perfume at the end of
this month and I'm so excited it'll be
here for back-to-school time so what
took the longest amount of time for this
project was the bottle and the packaging
I really wanted this to be super special
and I knew you guys wouldn't be able to
smell it before you were buying it
so I wanted to overall package to just
be something really beautiful that would
look beautiful on your shelf and your
perfume try it so when I was designing
this perfume I really wanted to do
something that a I wouldn't get to pick
up and be that wasn't like too
overpowering but that smell is fresh and
amazing
so once I'm allowed to show you guys the
whole thing I will talk about all the
notes in it and what it smells like and
all that good stuff but for today I just
have the sample bottle to show you I do
have all the final packaging and the
final bottle and everything like that so
it's super exciting I can't wait to
finally show it to guys so I've been
wearing this perfume for about a year
now and I got stopped so many times
Michelet on vacation and they both asked
me like what perfume I was wearing so
it's so exciting that I can finally say
that I will be launching the end of this
month I'm gonna spray a little bit on it
because I don't have any on today but
I'm just so refreshing so hopefully the
next two weeks or so I'll be able to
reveal the entire bottle I'm so excited
for you guys to see this it's super
heavy and expensive looking and it's
just absolutely gorgeous so I'm so
excited about it but I haven't mentioned
that in my
favorite video because I've been wearing
it for so long and this month is a month
than it launched it so I hope you guys
are excited it smells like heaven along
the subject of sense in order to show
you guys this oil diffuser that I have
you can really get any brand any tight
but this is one of three that I do have
I keep one buyer bedroom I keep lens
down like in the kitchen area and that I
have one in the laundry room where some
of the litter boxes are because I don't
really like using candles that much so I
have like a million different oils but I
find myself always gravitating towards
these three on sometimes for my
favorites are peppermint eucalyptus
lavender and then sometimes I'll throw
in tea tree but I love mixing eucalyptus
lavender peppermint together it's just
smells so amazing this one goes on like
a 3-hour timer so I keep it on for 3
hours every night while we're going to
sleep and then the one in the laundry
room you have to just keep filling up a
little bit smaller so it doesn't last as
long so it'll just keep working until
like it runs out of water what helps
keep everything smooth fresh and a great
alternative to candles I know they make
soy candles now that they say are better
for you but I don't know I just feel
like candles they used up so quickly
they're so expensive and although the
oils can be pricey I highly recommend
getting them off Amazon that's where I
get mine because I was actually hoping
the other day and I was looking to
replace the three that I use the most
because I'm basically empty and for a
little tiny jar like this it was like
$25 for the oil so I immediately went
right on to Amazon and I got a bottle
about this big actually now says I
didn't even bring them up yet they're
about this big so I feel like triple in
size and I think there were like $10 so
next up I have the cover FX custom
enhancer drop in the color moonlight so
I've been mixing this in with my
foundation the past couple of weeks I do
have like a bunch of different favorites
or like a similar product but this one
is just the one that I keep grabbing for
so it's absolutely beautiful swatch it
on my hand so you guys can see it so you
could mix this in with your foundation
you can use it as a highlighter it
really just a pen so if I just barely
tap it in you could see like how insane
this is but I'll show you like a little
bit like actually blended in
more you can see so that's it like
blended you can still see a beautiful
sheen and then this is it just like
dropped onto my skin so when I talked
about this and one of my get ready with
me videos it's the Vita Liberata body
blur you can see it's literally mg it's
in the color latte and this is just the
most amazing product I love it for like
an instant tan I have it on my body
right now basically every single video
for the past couple of months I used
that it's just easy if you have lighter
skin and you want with a quick instant
tan without having to actually either
lay out of the Sun or apply a
self-tanner basically like makeup for
your body and it washes off at the end
of the night so whenever I do wear it I
come home I shower and then I get into
bed and I feel nice and clean so it's
off so this is hands-down one of my
favorite cut of probably ever as far as
I can instant tan so you guys haven't
tried to see it and you're looking for
one I definitely thought this up while
on the subject of tanning products a lot
of people have been asking what I use to
self tan if I don't want to wash off I
actually have a little bit of a natural
tan I got a little bit of a sunburn just
on this side when we were at the beach
over the weekend but the products that
I've been using probably for like three
years now is the loving tan deluxe
bronzed loose I like the color dark
sometimes I've used the ultra dark
depending on the color of my skin if I
wanted it like super dark I'm use the
ultra dark but I just got a new one in
so if you guys want to see a caning
routine video I haven't done one in
probably like four years let me know but
this has been my favorite favorite
products to you that I want like a pan
and I don't have time for my that's
trying to spray me so it's crazy because
in my last couple of videos when I used
in our concealer a lot more telling that
nard is no longer tool t3 which is just
2017 almost dozen 18 like why now they
decide to go and sell their products in
China and tests on animals I don't know
super disappointing super upsetting
because their concealer was literally my
life but I went back to my rody
concealer I use it again today and I
really do like how it looks on me it
covers nicely it's a very similar
consistency to the Matt NARS concealer
that I was using all the time this is in
the color Aspen and I really like this
one it does basically the same job and
at first I was like oh no what am I
going to use but then I started using
this again I realize like why I loved it
in the first place
and then also of course my shape tape
this is like I need this in my life it's
a very full coverage concealer I love
using this down the sides of my nose to
blend out the nose contour and it's just
one of my hands-down favorite concealer
I have three of them out in front of me
at all times depending on how can I am
in the color medium I also have light
medium and light neutral so these ones
are always out right in front of me at
all times doing and go back in their
drawer it's just my hands-down favorite
concealer the next part that I wanted to
talk about is the siharan by dubious
place palette this is how I'm is
actually in my last video these colors
are literally insane so pigmented that
looks as green so pretty sick literally
one swipe this is what it looks like
this is in the color blue Dobby wodaabe
Mugabi look at Senegal I'm probably
pronouncing these are all I apologize
but look at this one one swipe hoola
and let's watch the koto which is like a
beautiful matte orange you read tries
crying outside my door so that's the NAP
sheet unbelievable it's so pigmented I
purchased probably like five of their
palettes but this one I've been using a
lot of use it today on my eyes as well I
just love the color and you guys know it
kind of sticks like warmer shades but
you know let me swatch one more just for
fun I must watch kiya amazing I
definitely want to use a slightly next
tutorial look at that it's like a
beautiful bluish turquoise so gorgeous
and I do have a coupon code for you guys
which I'll list below but these palettes
are no jokes are amazing the next pot
that I had to include because I
literally use it every single day and
every single my videos because I just
can't help it I really love it that much
is my Carli bybel on the Left Venetian
palette so when I created this palette
originally the original palette it was
only going to stay around for a year and
then be done but because it was doing so
well and you guys loved it so much we
decided to keep it around for another
year and I wanted to add some new shades
to it so I'm so grateful for all of your
love and support on this palette it is
literally my baby and it's only around
for a couple more months so I wanted to
include it again today to remind you
guys that this palette is only 2250 and
the colors are the same so I'll swatch a
few shades of these as well I'm going to
do one of my favorite favorite new
shades this one's definitely one of my
favorites out of the whole palette the
shade next to it which is a little bit
more of like a orange e undertone once
way um let's do one of my favorite
highlighters is this new champagne gold
you want to come in all right I'll come
in you might do oh sorry
she's crying and litterin so I'm going
to go in with the darkest highlight
color I will do a couple map shades as
well we're going to do the third shades
of the top row one swipe and then we're
going to do one of my other favorites
the matte mob shade and we'll do one
more which one we're going to do the
actually I'll do the two new highlights
then we do the white color one swipe
crazy and then the color right next with
that purpley highlight shade this
palette will be ending soon so I just
wanted to mention it in today's video
because I don't know I'm stopping up on
it because once it's gone forever I
still will use it every single day I
just love it so much I have the new
Charlotte slippery feline flick I was
using the physician's formula which I
did like with this one I just tried out
actually recently and I actually loved
how black it is it's super pigmented it
doesn't slide all over the place because
it has almost like a little bit of
little rougher felt tip so it gives you
more precise control so I really really
love this one next I have my bite agave
chapstick I use it almost every single
day you can wear it over my lipsticks
sometimes because I hate when they get
too dry so I have like three of these
one of them is right next to my bed and
in this one stays right in my makeup
area so this one super random but it's a
third bottle that I went through so I
figured I would mention it it is cruelty
free and fluoride free it's the hello
brand natural sweet mint toothpaste so I
stock up on these this is the one that
we've both been loving and I just wanted
to mention it because the floor I three
which is
so important look into it if you guys
don't know about fluoride free
toothpaste and the final product I'm
going to talk about today is the alterna
Kennedy oil dry oil myth
I just been using this because I like to
spray it on my hair it doesn't leave it
too greasy so it's just like a shine
mist that I've been using and again it
doesn't leave it like - oh it is a dry
oil so I've been loving that product
basically empty and you guys can see and
yeah I think that's really it as far as
my current favorites I have so many
products in front of me and I wanted to
narrow it down to only talk about the
ones that I really really love so those
are them I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I can't wait to go head down south
and refill my first ever video it's so
surreal that the end of August will be
six years like it's absolutely
mind-blowing I don't know how time is
going so fast but thank you guys so much
for watching I love you so much and till
next time I'll see you guys later
