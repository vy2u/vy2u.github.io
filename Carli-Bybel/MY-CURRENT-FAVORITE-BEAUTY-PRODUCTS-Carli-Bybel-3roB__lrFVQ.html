those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and today I'm gonna be talking
about my beauty favorites from the past
month or two I feel like it's been a
very long time since I've done a
favorites video and I just wanted to
talk about some of the products that
I've really been loving the past couple
of months so if you want to hear what
they are then please keep watching so
the first product that I wanted to talk
about is from Natasha de Nonna
this is the chroma crystal topcoat in
brown ma / purple and this is what it
looks like I use this for the first time
in my get ready with me video for
Valentine's Day and ever since that day
I swear every time I've gone out I've
been wearing my eye makeup like that so
you can see I have it on right now it's
super shimmery and beautiful and you
guys do like my makeup right now I will
link my get ready with me right here so
you guys can go check it out I bought
all three colors but I only tried this
one for now I'm definitely gonna be
trying the other ones in the next couple
of days or two because I'm just like
obsessed so next up I have these cover
effects drops these are literally insane
I have them in the color lunar and
aurora so the only difference with my
eye makeup look today versus the one in
my get ready with me as I applied a
little bit of aurora right over the
shadow just to give it a little bit more
of like a sparkle so I'm gonna swatch
these two for you guys so you can see
how amazing they really are so I'm just
gonna do like one drop and you can see
so this matches my shirt honestly
perfectly right now but I love love love
this shade and then there's this bluer
one we're gonna swatch next to it just
one drop again so that's the purple and
the blue and these you can really mix in
with anything you can use them as
eyeshadow you can add them as like a
highlight you can mix it in with
foundation if you want to go a little
crazy you can add them into a lip color
to give it like a really pretty high
shine you can really do anything with it
whatever your heart desires but oh hello
mr. berry where you going big boy but
just look at these amazing well on the
subject of sparkly amazing products I
have this my color pop it's a supernova
shadow in prelude you can again use this
for your lips you can put it as like a
highlight but it's meant to be like a
shadow base when you look at it straight
on it looks pink but when you like move
it in the light it has like an orange e
finished next up I have this lip topper
by Becca in the color amethyst and this
is what I'm wearing right now this is
what I wore in my Valentines Day video
and like I mentioned in my last video I
don't really wear glosses that much and
when I try this one out
I think this made me become a gloss girl
again which is crazy because I have not
wearing blocks in so long I just apply a
little bit over my regular lipstick and
it just adds some most beautiful
beautiful shine to it so this is the
gloss right here so I don't know this
one is still in stock I know when I last
tried to link it it wasn't but if you
see here this and this kind of looks
similar so like I was saying if you want
to mix in some of the cover FX drops
until like a clear gloss you can make
your own gloss like this which is pretty
cool because just looking at them swatch
next to each other they do look pretty
similar so next up I'm gonna quickly
talk about my favorite foundation which
is the Fiona styles this is the luminous
foundation
so originally I was obsessed with the
mat foundation and they discontinued it
don't know why but I feel like when I
don't use this foundation because I've
been trying to like switch things up
recently I feel like my makeup just
doesn't look as good so I don't know if
it's in my head or what but I just
really feel like this foundation is
amazing for my specific skintone I
always have trouble finding like my
exact color I'm always mixing like two
or three colors together and I found the
most perfect shades with her line for my
own skin tone and I just really loved
the finish and it covers really
beautifully so this one I definitely
recommend for anybody looking for a nice
full coverage foundation so next up I
have an old favorite that I just
recently started using again this is by
Joseph's colors it's a baked highlighter
and the color of pearl dust I don't
always like to wear a highlighter like
usually I don't so what I've been doing
is after I apply like my matte blush
I'll apply a little bit of this over it
and it just gives like a really pretty
shimmer to it so it's like a white up
kind of highlight without actually
highlighting just really really
beautiful and I must have gotten this
like three years ago but I just pulled
it out of my drawer and I've been using
it ever since so next up I have by
Charlotte Tilbury this is the contour
wand in fair medium and I have been
using this to a cream contour my face I
don't use this for my nose but I've been
using it for my entire face elsewhere
it's super lightweight it blends really
easy and I just personally have been
loving it over my normal favorite which
is the graftobian I still love that one
as well
but this one again it's a little bit
lighter of a shade so you don't have to
go crazy blending it as much and it's
really really creamy and I love how it
has like an applicator on it so all you
do is spin it on squeeze it just a
little bit because I used a little bit
too much the first time and you can just
apply it right onto your face
so for the longest time I was like
searching for a really good eyeliner
there was always ones that I liked but
never really loved I've been using this
one by its heart it's the Tarte East
eyeliner it's double sided I don't use
sigh which is like a regular eyeliner
but I do use the felt tip side and this
is like the blackest eyeliner that I
have found with this type of felt tip I
really love the marker type eyeliners
they just are a lot easier for me and
I've been using this one for probably
about a month or so and it's still super
super dark and nice and it doesn't dry
out easily a lot of the other ones that
I would use after like doing it a couple
times I have to like rub it all over the
back of my hand and just kind of like
try and get more ink out of it but this
one is amazing I highly highly recommend
it and it's definitely one of my
all-time favorites so I recently just
tried out this product with my sink
chiapas and it's a face tanner the past
two times that I applied self-tanner on
my body I used the loving tan I never
like to apply that on my face but I hate
when my body is like super super tan and
my face is really pale just because with
makeup sometimes like if it wipes off
you can see how light my skin is
underneath so the past two times I use
these Saint Tropez bronzing lotion for
your face and it's honestly really
really good I have very sensitive skin
so I was always like really hesitant
about putting any self-tanner product on
my face because I didn't want to break
out and I didn't want to get like
blackheads and everything like that but
the past few times like I mentioned I
used this and I really really loved it I
left it on for probably about like four
or five hours and I still have a nice
tan from it I just got back from Miami
and I was looking nice and tan and this
product definitely helped achieve a
great tan for my face without breaking
me out like I have no pimples whatsoever
so definitely recommend this guy as well
so lately I have been obsessed with the
lining my inner lash line with a nude
eye pencil on my last three trips the
past three weeks because I've been away
for freakin three weeks straight I
brought this product with me and I've
been using it it just really makes my
eyes look more open I feel like
more awake this one is my color pop in
the color honey dude and I think these
are like five dollars but it's very
pigmented you can also use this products
like carve out your eyebrows underneath
I don't personally do that I just use it
on my inner lash line but with nude
pencils you can find like multi-use for
them so this one amazing so next up I
have the Kat Von D locket
blotting powder in the color light and
this I have been bringing with me
everywhere so normally I would just
bring like a foundation powder the one
by Kat Von D with me if I start getting
oily but I notice after like a few times
having to apply it I just felt like I
had too much makeup caked on because it
is a heavy powder so I picked this one
up probably about a month ago and I've
been brilliant with me every time I've
gone out and I just use it to just kind
of like lightly blot anywhere that I
look oily throughout the night and it's
a very lightweight powder so it's just
gonna blot it without adding like too
much texture too much product to your
face so I believe it comes in like three
different shades this one is in the
color light and it comes with one of
these puffs so you can just kind of like
lightly apply it so you can apply it
with the puff or you can just blend it
in with like a regular brush I'll
usually use a brush um but you can use
the puff that comes with it as well so
the next product is by Ben Nye it's
called final seal I recently started
using it again probably like two months
ago it has a really weird smell to it
but it's a matte finishing sealer and I
swear it's like one of the best setting
sprays I found I have other sprays that
I like to apply as I'm doing my makeup
but this is like the final final product
that I use to set my face just make sure
you don't get this in your eyes and you
don't need to use too much of it and I
swear it really really works I love Ben
Nye products
I wish Trust Theater makeup because you
know it needs to look good and light and
you know it needs to look good for a
long period of time and the last two
products that I'm going to talk about
are my current favorites I've gone
through like three bottles at this point
it's the on the rocks clarifying
charcoal shampoo and the lightweight
replenishing can
both by Drybar I first use these
products when I did the eatin or wear it
challenge with my little cousin and I
had food in my hair so I ended up
washing and conditioning my hair
probably like three times that day and
then after I got in the shower I was
just like dying over how amazing my hair
smell they are small bottles so I go
through them like way quicker than I
actually should but I love the smell of
them I love how my hair feels after it
the conditioner makes my hair feel super
super soft and yeah I've been so
obsessed with these past couple of
months I don't remember when I filmed
that video I think that was in December
so so about like three months I've been
using this product so I just got back
from Miami as I mentioned and I just
want to say I had like a near-death
experience we got hit with a huge
nor'easter here yesterday and two of my
flights were canceled so I was on
Expedia trying to book it through my
flight because I wanted to get home and
I ended up getting standby for an early
flight on United and when I got to the
airport I was just like praying that I
was gonna get on the flight because
otherwise my flight wouldn't have been
going home until 10:00 p.m. which meant
I would have landed it like why I am so
when I got to the airport I was like
rushing through security I got there
super late and when I got there I was
number one on the standby list which was
great so I ended up hitting on the
flight when we got on the flight they
were warning us that there's gonna be
really bad turbulence when we get closer
to Newark because of the wind and the
nor'easter and blah blah blah blah so I
was really nervous going into it but I
was like you know what they wouldn't fly
if it wasn't safe so with 40 minutes
left in the flight the flight attendants
came around and like made us all put our
seat backs up and like be prepared for
like the turbulence and everything like
that and the captain kept coming over
the speaker and keeping us updated on
what was going on but it was when I tell
you the scariest flight that I've ever
been on when we were like approaching
newer and like descending down you
couldn't see anything out the window it
was just all clouds and fog it was so
turbulent I was just holding on I was on
the plane by myself so I had like no
like look at and be like oh my god oh
we're gonna like survive and there's one
point where the whole plane I swear went
like completely sideways everyone
started screaming I was just in my own
head pranking like please please don't
let me die like this it's so crazy when
you have no control and you just have to
sit there and just like deal with it
when we were about to land the plane was
like going like this like crazy and it
was probably the worst landing ever but
when we finally got on the ground
everyone started clapping and cheering
and it was so crazy because I've been on
planes with turbulence before but that
was hands down the scariest thing that
I've ever experienced so I just want to
say that I appreciate you guys I
appreciate my feet being on the ground
and never take any minute program
because you just never know really
random but I just wanted to fill you in
on my crazy life-changing experience
once I landed I called like everybody in
my family and I was just like if I
haven't told you lately I love you and
yeah it was a really crazy experience
for me so I'm happy to be home with my
children safe and the weather is not too
crazy today when we got home my
trampoline was blown like 100 feet out
onto someone else's driveway so that was
fun so it was really crazy here in
Jersey but today it's a little bit dark
but nothing like yesterday so I want to
know what you guys want to see next week
so make sure to comment below let me
know I hope you guys enjoyed this
favorites video thank you so much for
watching and it's the next time I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
