sudden Carly look services what do you

like the best you you think I think I am
best Elvis impersonator on every er brah
that's right
oh my god you'd like ready to go to New
York City almost hey what do I get to do
next
I am I found out I'm just gonna say
can't do the eyeshadow no what color are
we wearing today Carli bybel palette we
love it let's see I guess we start with
the biggest first let me use this brush
and this is a work I'm gonna feed
Murphy hold on who's machiners got a
shirt oh my god putting that right into
my crease I am putting it into the
crease because I will increase then he
sees we have to look better
I mean God I'm gonna give you a make up
from that one oh I'm gonna use a
different brush because the more fresh
although very effective I'm gonna need
something a little finer so we're gonna
use a paint brush just as good yeah
we're gonna go from light to dark don't
know why why I don't know why but I
think that's probably a Chilean clue
that's maybe too dark
oh my god now you were definitely
eyebrows look like The Lion King if you
were the king of the board
[Laughter]
perfect that looks much better close
your eye closed as long as a color
magician which I am I would say let's
use a never know what how much is too
much
you're running out underneath like that
yeah now this is the best way to hide
bags you don't have any he's a hot pink
shimmer eyeshadow hot pink shimmer
eyeshadow and just cover them bags Wow

cuz the pink cancels out the blue of
your natural undertone right I couldn't
have put it any better myself thanks to
