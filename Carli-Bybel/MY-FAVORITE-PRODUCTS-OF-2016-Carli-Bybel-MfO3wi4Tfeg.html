hello everybody thank you for watching
today I'm going to be talking about some
of my favorite products from 2016 so
where does 2017 17th my lucky number so
I'm actually really excited about this
year I feel like it's going to be a
great year but besides the fact I just
can't believe it's 2017 like where is
the time going yesterday me and Brett
celebrated our four year anniversary
which is also crazy I can't believe it's
been four years I mean we've been dating
way longer than that we started dating
when I was a junior in high school it
was like on and off for a while and it's
so crazy that I've been on YouTube for
five years now but yeah nothing me
reminiscing about how fast my life is
going let's talk about some of the
products I do have a lot of makeup
products that I'm going to be talking
about but I have also a lot of like
skincare and like hair and like right
moment products as well I wanted to talk
about like my most used products so if
you guys want to hear what they are
please keep watching where to start
where to start I have so many things in
front of me
barrel movie Bonhams gosh can you see
your little tummies sticking it I know
easily has depending on that oh so first
I'm going to start with primers um I had
shown you guys will kind of happen to my
primer in my last video I just got a
take the time to pick off the gloves it
comes right off but this is the Too
Faced hangover primer the reason that I
went back to this one I used to use this
one a lot and I stopped using it for a
little bit but when I use it again a
couple months ago the smell was just
like so refreshing and so nice that I
just went back to it whenever my skin's
feeling a little bit dry I've always
used this one I also haven't
I'm gonna talk about in a minute that's
more like a mattifying primer but I
would say if you guys have dry skin or
like flaky skin maybe try and stay away
from the mattifying primer and try and
find something more nourishing for your
skin so this one along with my cover FX
mattifying primer are my food favorite
this one also has anti acne treatment in
it before I ever apply my primer so I
always wash my face and I apply a face
lotion I'll get to that in a little bit
but I just wanted to say that if you
guys are applying makeup and you want it
to last all day and you want to look
really smooth and nice the key is to
always always moisturize before you
prime I have been a creature of habit
with this one palette in particular it's
the graftobian
cream foundation palette which you guys
have heard me talk about a bajillion
times so this is actually my second
palette that I went through in 2016 and
I prefer to use a cream foundation
usually during the day or in the
summertime when it's warmer as opposed
to the liquid foundation during the
winter time I usually tend to stick with
a liquid foundation but I'm going to go
back and forth sometimes I'll even layer
it depending on how much makeup that I'm
actually going for but that palette in
my opinion is just one of my favorites
you can use a tiny bit and it's so
pigmented and it covers really really
well it's really funny because la girl
came out with this new pro coverage HD
foundation and my favourite foundation
before I switched over to croce 3 was
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
I haven't found like a great drugstore
foundation that I really love that was
cruelty free and when I tried to sit
remind me so much of the Make Up For
Ever foundation so if you guys are on a
budget and you're looking for like a
really nice coverage something that
looks really good on film also that
looks great in the daylight this is an
amazing foundation this
is in the color fair and then I also use
the color natural sometimes I have to
mix it but today I just use these fair
colors while on the subject of
foundation I also wanted to talk about
the Charlotte feel very wonder glow it's
like a illuminator that I mix in with my
foundations I love love love this
product it's so lightweight it's so nice
I kept it on my skin before I applied my
foundation to give it like a subtle glow
you can kind of see since I don't really
like to highlight I like to apply this
underneath or mix it in with my
foundation definitely try adding an
illuminator into your foundation it's
your favorite concealers I'm sure you
guys can guess my NARS creamy concealer
is definitely my go-to favorite
concealer um they also recently came out
with I'm pretty sure they're out now the
concealer is like in a jar which again
on my favorite I love the formula I
recently went back to my Tarte concealer
which used to be one of my favorites
which is the creaseless one and I use it
and my under eyes crease so bad so I was
like okay so now I know like my NARS
it's like my go-to if I don't want to
crease if I wanted to stay on all night
so for me for my skin the NARS just
works the best my holy grail for like
years now is the LA girl Pro conceal HD
concealers I have this one in toast
beautiful bronze creamy beige and like
ivory those are probably my most used
shades I feel like the LA girl Pro
conceal is very very similar to the NARS
concealer as far as coverage as far as
how easy it is to blend and all that
good stuff so my favorite powder for
2016 was definitely the Ben Nye Cameo
powder I have this in like every color I
have the banana powder I have the pretty
pink powder they're just the best in my
opinion they're made for theater they're
made to last forever cameo is definitely
my most used as far as color the banana
powder is really good for like studying
contoured areas for
skintone or if you have a darker
complexion try the banana one and really
love the pink powder as well if you guys
have dark circles or dark under eyes
that tend to come out throughout the day
what I like to do is apply my corrector
concealer and then use a pink powder the
pink powder is going to help cancel out
that darkness all throughout the day so
you know sometimes when you set your
concealer like a few hours later you can
see the darkness coming through if you
set it with a pink powder it's going to
counteract that darkness and it's going
to help keep it like super bright I only
use that if I do have like darker
circles for whatever reason if I'm
dehydrated or if I don't get a lot of
sleep so if you guys do naturally just
have darker under eyes try that check
out let me know how it works for you
guys but yeah if you don't have the
darker circles don't use the pink
because it's gonna look pink under your
eyes and it's not going to do what you
want it to do so the Cameo is probably
the best it's just the perfect color
powder in my opinion to bake under your
eyes
so next of course I had to talk about my
favorite palette my palette that i
designed with BH Cosmetics this came out
last September not the one that just
passed it is going to be ending soon it
is limited edition as we said we did
extend it a little longer than planned
but I do have something else that I've
been working on that was supposed to
launch for the holidays but it's taking
a little bit longer so I can't talk
about it yet but you guys gonna be super
excited about it but if you guys didn't
realize although it's still available it
is limited time and it will only be
available for a few more months the
reason that I really do love this
palette so much obviously I created it
and I'm proud of it of course but I just
feel like I use it almost every single
day it just has so many different colors
that work well for like a day to a night
look and I don't know I just feel like
now what I use people are coming out
with new products like every week and
people feel like oh my god I need this I
need that and like in reality if you
have a few staple products that's really
all that you need and I feel like this
palette really is a staple for me it's
so funny because I went online last
night on Ulta because I was
to order a few more just to have because
like I said since it's going to be gone
soon I want to like stock up that way I
can give them to people and give them to
family members then just to have them of
course and it sold out on old accom
which is amazing so thank you guys so
much but its own sock on BH Cosmetics
comm and I know all the Ulta stores and
the u.s. do carry my palette guys can
call or just go stop by and see if they
have it but thank you guys seriously for
all the love it means everything to me
and it makes me feel so proud that I was
able to create something that you guys
are able to use and love and afford like
I know some people who are on their
third and their fourth one already was
just so cool and that's what I really
wanted I wanted to create something that
everybody can afford something that you
could use every single day and it'd just
be worth every penny
so how to include that in my 2016
favorites so I haven't unpacked since
Bahamas which is ridiculous but I'm
missing a lot of my favorite products
because I have to unpack so the one
product that I really wanted to talk
about today it's really the only one
that I couldn't find is the modern
renaissance palette by Anasazi Beverly
Hills it's definitely my other favorite
palette of the year I think it's so
beautiful it's so romantic
and it's just one of my all-time
favorites so although I don't have it
right now to show you guys I'm sure you
I already seen it and if you haven't I'm
gonna link it for you guys below if you
want to go check it out I haven't used
it in a bunch of videos so I will link
those as well and the third palette that
I wanted to talk about is the Kylie
cosmetics Burgundy palette this one is
definitely one of my favorites as well I
use it all the time the colors in it are
just so beautiful and again it's perfect
for like a day to night look
so I feel like the modern renaissance
the Kylie palette and my palette have
really been my favorite and it's funny
because they all have kind of similar
shade I do also love the Kat Von D
contract kit I don't like what they're
like two regular ones throughout the
year and then I just picked this one up
I don't know if it's a limit
addition but I got it before the
holidays it's like a hard cover one with
like 3d writing and then the kit has
magnetic pan so you can refill it which
is awesome because these two always go
away quicker than the other ones in the
palette it's good to bronze it's been to
contour it's good to highlight really
everything this is the charlotte ovary
magic cream i have the smaller version
that i use throughout the year but this
was a limited edition jumbo size that I
picked up from Nordstrom it's just so
nice it's so silky it makes your skin
just feel like velvet so I have been
using this underneath my makeup for at
least the past six or seven months and
it just helps keep my makeup on so nice
throughout the night just makes your
skin feel like a baby's butt so that's
definitely one of my favorites and one
of my most used day creams i saw few
people i saw few people asking my last
video what my favorite lash glue was
it's the kiss strip lash adhesive with
aloe and it's the black version it's
hypoallergenic and ooh that's twice that
I dropped it I lost the cap hence why I
ended up all over my primer but this is
my second one that I used about the year
I just love it because it's so black
it's not like gray like some of the
other dark black lash glues it's like
pure black so you never see that line
which is key because of course if you
use regular like white lash glue you can
go over with a black eye liner but if
you're a little lazy and you don't want
to do that extra step this will help
save you like an extra I don't know
minute or two while doing your makeup so
I'm not going to open this up because
it's broken I have to get a new one but
this is the Kat Von D lock-it tattoo
foundation this is in the color light 48
this is one of my favorite powder
foundations you can use this all over
your face you can use it to highlight
underneath your eyes at the end of your
routine to blend everything together
it's just one of my favorite full
coverage powders the other powder
foundation that I do like is by Tarte
it's the loose clay foundation powder
which is amazing
this one I use all the time it's
definitely like a staple in my everyday
routine when I'm using the highlighter
I'm only really applying it like on my
nose under here I got my lip and
sometimes like in the tear ducts of my
eyes so it's funny because when I was
thinking of different highlighters that
I use the ones that I use the most are
definitely from my palette I always
always always use this light pink one
right here which is actually eye shadow
so I always use that and I love the
second highlight shade and I love the
gold I just love them all for highlight
so I feel like those are the ones I
really always use but I recently started
using the citroen ooh
highlighter but the only thing that
thinks about it is it's really really
soft and it breaks very easily so you
have to be super careful with it but
it's a gorgeous shade um today I
actually used a different highlighter
that you guys will be seeing very soon
so down moving on to lashes my top two
without a doubt are the Christina WSP
lashes or the red cherry WSP they're
exactly the same these are cheaper
versions of those and then also the
House of lashes iconic these are just
when I go to every single time I do my
makeup the reason for that is I would
always wear the make lashes but since I
switched over to cruelty-free I have to
branch out and really try a bunch of
cruelty free lashes but these are
definitely my top favorites of 2016 I
think my most used setting spray is the
lavender right all day
so come in little mini sizes which are
so cute I like to use them as soon as I
apply powder to just kind of miss my
face and let everything melt together
and then I use it to set my face this
one is in the flavor T we say flavor in
the scent t / ginger and this is the
lavender one so these are definitely my
two favorite scents the next favorite is
very random but I wanted to talk about
it so this is like a little brush that I
got on Amazon and it's to clean
underneath your nails isn't it so hard
to clean under your nails especially
when they're long especially when you're
doing makeup or if you like stick your
hand into a lotion yarn it's like stuck
under it this is so important especially
if you're using your hands and all over
your face you're touching your dirty
cellphone you're touching like
everything like just all those germs you
need to get the bacteria out from
underneath your nails so this I use all
the time bring it in the shower with you
use it while you're in the shower like
no one ever talks about so clean under
your nails so the next product is
definitely my Holy Grail skincare
product whenever I don't use it because
there has been times where I'm like oh
you know what I want to try something
new my skin just breaks out whenever I'm
using it I sometimes do get breakouts
but nowhere near as much as if I'm not
using it it's my face reality it's the
mandelic face and body scrub you can use
it on your body or your face I just use
it on my face and my neck personally but
I've been using this for about two or
three years and it's just the only
product that can really like keep my
skin calm no matter what I'm using as
far as makeup or anything like that so
this I used to just pick up at the
facial place that I go to but I haven't
gone in so long so I actually just
recently ordered another one online so
yeah I know a lot of people are asking
all about my skincare routine which I
will definitely do an updated routine I
have a bunch of new products that I've
been trying out as I'm lately trying to
find some new favorites so I have a few
products that I wanted to talk about
that
really really helped my eczema in 2016
I feel like 2016 was definitely the
worst year or one of the worst years yet
for my eczema obviously with eczema a
lot of it has to do with diet but I just
want to talk about some of the products
that really did help me the dr. teals
pure Epsom salt soaking solutions
I had big big bags in them I went
through about like three of them and
this isn't really the one that I use the
most this is the lavender one which is
really nice before bed but they have one
that's eucalyptus that is amazing that I
just absolutely love it smells so
amazing so I always will put in like if
it were this size I feel like half a bag
in a tub and I would just soak in it for
about 20-30 minutes they also have like
an avocado moisturizing bath I feel like
the baths definitely helped me a lot
with my eczema flare-ups so if you guys
are suffering right now try it out try a
bleach band out as well I know it sounds
crazy just google it and just make sure
you're getting the right measurements
and all that but that really helps me as
well another product that basically
saved my life it's called HIPAA cleanse
floor I'm not going to try to say it so
this is what it looks like it kills all
bacteria on your skin and one of the
problems with eczema is when you scratch
a new itch and you open up the skin it's
letting bacteria into your body which
then makes your eczema that much worse
so this I keep in my shower with me I
have to pick up another one you can pick
this up right at CVS it's an anti septic
anti macro Beale skin cleanser and I'll
just use this and rub it for about 14 15
seconds on my affected area and then
wash it off and it helps kill bacteria
on your skin so while we're on the
shower stuff I have this little brush
that I definitely mentioned before on a
favorites video
it's the tangle teezer and it's just
like a plastic brush that I keep in the
shower whenever I wash out the
conditioner I always brush on my hair in
the shower so I know they say you
shouldn't
your hair when it's wet I like to break
the rules I don't know my hair is really
long and healthy and it doesn't stop
growing never I brush it when it's dry I
ended up having hair all over my floor
which means I have to go get dust buster
clean it up so whenever it's in the
shower it gets stuck in the brush and
then I clean the hair out of the brush
when I throw it right in the garbage and
then as soon as I get out of the shower
um I use these little things which I
wanted to talk about too because they
save so much time on laundry you can get
these like at the drugstore they're like
the Turbie twist things for your hair so
I use this instead of a towel on my hair
I used to always just use a towel and I
can reuse these a million times because
your hair is clean when you're getting
out so once I'm done with it I hang it
back up I let it dry and I reuse this
like I don't know as many times as I
want before I feel like all right you
know what it's time to clean it and
these are just two things that I use
literally every time I showers I just
felt it necessary to bring them one more
skin care product and then two hair
products and then that should be really
it for now I have my lotion that I've
been using as well for about five six
months now and it's been amazing it's
the premium triple cream for effectually
for babies it's for severe skin and
eczema so this is what it looks like it
comes in a little tube like this you can
also get it in like a squeezy tube but
these lasts a lot longer
I get these right off Amazon and it's
like an unscented thick lotion which is
perfect for people who have eczema it's
always good to get something with no
scent and also something that's thicker
so this has just really really helped me
that's been like my routine as far as
how I've kept it calm it was so bad for
a while and it's just been like at a
constant like calm level it's not gone
completely but like I can live and not
think about it 24/7 it's all about what
you're putting into your body so start
eating more fruits more vegetables you
know cut out all the dairy and all the
meat products and all the animal
products all the gross stuff that your
body just can't handle I have to well
it's one product but I have both sizes I
just wanted to talk about really quickly
and I think that's really it I feel like
this videos long enough at this point
this is my three-in-one texturising
volume spray
it's my dry bar
I have my big size and then I have my
travel size that I bring with me
everywhere I love this for adding
texture into your hair I didn't use it
today because my hair like actually this
is my hair curl I call it last night for
our anniversary and then I just brushed
in this is what it looks like today but
I wanted it kind of like flat and like
silky but I'll spray it a little bit so
it just adds like texture and volume to
your hair I love this bite especially
when I'm doing like big waves or like
beachy waves anything like that it's
just amazing so yeah that is really it
as far as like my most used favorite
products of 2016 obviously there's so
many others that I didn't mention but
these ones just really stood out to me
and I didn't want to sit up here for
like an hour telling you about all these
products that I love because I do love
so many but these are like my top top
Holy Grail can't live without products
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I'm so happy to be back I love you guys
so much and until next time I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
