today's video I'm going to show you all
of my favorite skincare products at the
moment everything that I use on my face
as well as my body I know this video has
been highly requested for a really long
time now so I can honestly say all the
products in front of me I am obsessed
with I love and I use on a daily basis
so I'm really excited to share them with
you guys today so if you want to hear
what they are then please keep watching
so I do have a lot of products in front
of me right now I figured I would start
with what I use in the morning for my
morning routine and then I'll show you
guys what I use at night some of the
masks that I use maybe like once or
twice a month and then I will go into
what I use on my body so every morning I
start off by washing my face I have to
wash my face before bed and also as soon
as I wake up it's like this crazy anal
thing that I have to do like I can't use
a makeup wipe just to remove my makeup I
feel grossed out and I won't sleep well
so when I wake up I always use my face
reality mandelic face and body scrub
I've been using this product probably
about four maybe five years now I found
out about this from the place that I
used to go and get my facials
unfortunately since I moved I really
haven't been able to get back there but
they specialize in acne and I really
just trusted anything she said so I did
try other products in between and I
notice I would break out so if I don't
want any breakouts and I want my skin to
look nice this is the product that I use
I recently just bought like 4 or 5 of
them because I go through them really
quick because again I do use it morning
and night this is really good for acne
prone skin if you have oily skin it is
an exfoliating scrub but it's not too
harsh on your skin I've never had any
issues with it whatsoever I did also try
the acne face scrub one that I broke out
a little bit but I didn't like it as
much so this is like my Holy Grail face
if you guys are looking for a good
exfoliating face wash I got this one
100% so once I washed my face I follow
my face wash directly with mine on dial
so I've been using this probably about
two months now and it is hands-down my
favorite product so my sister actually
started working for the company that
sells his product and when she first
started I wanted to buy a couple
products to support her of course I'm a
skincare junkie and I love trying new
things but ever since I've been using
this I swear my skin has been so much
better and the main reason that I didn't
purchase it to begin with was because
she swore that I would help with my
eczema and I have been using it on my
eczema and my eczema is completely gone
so that's another reason why I'm really
excited to talk about it today so now
the oil is the most hydrating ingredient
on the planet it's not an opinion that's
like a real fact and it just makes your
skin feel so nice I was always against
like using an oil on my face because
although my skin can be super super
drying and also be really oily so I was
a little hesitant at first and I started
off with just like one or two drops and
now I use like a lot like probably like
this much and I just put apply it all
over my face my neck I even apply it on
my chest I had burnt myself right here
on my chest and I applied it and there's
literally no scar so I have been using
it basically all over my hands where I
get my eczema the most and I'm just
obsessed with it this is my third bottle
already and I have two backup ones
because that's how much I really love
this stuff
so there are anti-aging ingredients in
this product as well so I was actually I
think the most excited to share this
products out of everything because I'm
obsessed with it it smells so good and
I've just really been loving the results
so far it helps to get rid of my fine
lines like under my eyes and also like
on this side
my eyes so I just think this product is
like pure gold and I'm just obsessed
with it so if you guys are looking for
an amazing skincare product that you can
use morning and night or even on your
eczema this is incredible and then I
will go in with the climate control
which is also from the sentence company
so for eczema how I cleared it with
these products was number L first and
then this is like a gel but it has like
a spray top to it so it's spray so you
can't spray it onto your face but I'll
also apply it right onto my hand as well
or you can just spray it right into your
hand mix it up and then apply it on your
face which is what I like to do so it
doesn't get in my hair or anything like
that and then again on my hand I've been
using the non-royal and then I applied
the climate control right over it and I
swear I was so hesitant about it I just
didn't believe that it would do what she
said it would do but it's my holy grail
product and it looks good under makeup
it's not just heavy
it definitely residue or anything like
that so I don't say anything wrong I'll
read you what is in this product when
you first get it you have to shake it
really well to activate the ingredient
and then once you activate it it'll be
activated forever it is infused with the
Senna Plex complex which has herbal oil
extracts and vitamins that increase
moisture it restores damaged cellular
roles it also has glucosamine HCL which
has anti-inflammatory properties that
help maintain elasticity this is a
moisturizer so you don't need to put
anything on top of it so in the morning
that's just the three products that I
use and then I'll go if I'm doing makeup
I'll go right in with my primer on top
of that so that is all that I use in the
morning as far as my skincare routine my
nighttime routine is a little bit more
lengthy and I swear I don't go one night
without applying all of these different
steps so obviously use your judgement
you don't need to use as many steps that
I use as far as my nighttime routine but
I'm like really anal with it and I'm 27
now and
doing a lot of stuffs probably for like
four years now because it's always good
to start the anti-aging skincare routine
in your 20s because you're gonna help
prevent it which is always good you
don't want to start too late in life
because then it's harder to prevent any
skin damage or anything like that
so my nighttime routine is a little bit
different because usually at the end of
the night I'll have makeup on so I
always always go in with a liquid
cleanser before I go in with my
exfoliating cleanser you can really use
anything I have these organic bars of
soap that I buy whole foods that if I
don't have one of my liquid soaps I'll
just use that and that is to remove all
of my makeup first I do have two
cleansing gels that I do use all the
time one is the Tarte rainforest of the
scene deep dive cleansing gel which
looks like this and then I also have
triple eleven skin I don't know how to
pronounce it one one one skin care it's
called liftoff purifying cleanser I
wouldn't say one is better than the
other
again I sometimes even use a bar of soap
but that's really to just get all the
makeup off my face so before I go in
with my mandelic scrub I make sure all
my makeup is off that way you're not
exfoliating makeup into your pores so
that's something really important I
think some people don't realize is if
you go right in with an exfoliating
cleanser with your makeup already on
you're just gonna be like exfoliating
your makeup into your skin which is like
it just like grosses me out so that is
something I always always do after I
have all of my makeup off sometimes I'll
have to use like a makeup wipe just to
kind of remove some mascara or anything
like that but after I make sure all my
makeup is removed I've been using these
bob or bob are pronounce it it's ba bo
are so they're little active fluids
these are really strong
serums which I like to use first on my
face that way my skin can really soak it
in
I want like five or six different types
if you go on their website they
like different types depending on like
what you're looking for as far as
skincare I bought one that had like
algae in it I bought one that was good
for like a nighttime fluid they have one
that's like pure hydration so there's a
bunch of different types the one that I
have left this is only the last one that
I had out of like the hundred that I
bought this is hydro plus active fluid
and it looks like this it comes in a
little glass jar and you snap off the
top and it's a lot of serum but you put
it all over your face I bring it down on
my neck I also massage my boobs with it
too it's really important to like care
about like this part of your body as
well because with the Sun and sun damage
this part of your body is always kind of
exposed to the Sun not always but it's
more than other parts of your body so
this I will use first always then I will
go back in with the non-oil apply use
like four or five drops again all over
my face my neck my chest then I go in
with my dark circle eye treatment I
wasn't sure if I was going to mention
this product today or not because I've
only been using it for two weeks but I
really really like it so I wanted to
talk to you guys about it it's the dark
circle eye treatment all apply this
before my eye cream and like I said I
just started using it but I really
already see results my dark circles are
really bad for a while and I noticed
that they're starting to lighten up a
little bit which is honestly shocking
because I've tried so many dark circle
treatments and I've even tried like this
laser that was supposed to remove the
dark pigment under your eyes that didn't
work so I really like this stuff it has
a little bit of a weird smell to it like
ice
that almost smells like cat pee which is
gross but my sister's like it doesn't
like happy you're crazy
but I love it and I will continue to use
it so after I use the dark circle
treatment I'll go in with my eye cream
the one that I've been using is by a
more Pacific it's the time response eye
renewal cream I'll apply that underneath
my eyes when I apply my eye cream I only
use these two fingers and I like Pat it
on first and then I like gently rub
around my eyes and I'll make sure I rub
it until it's like almost all absorbed
into my skin like I really take my time
with my skin care also the same thing
with the serums I like to with this one
it's gonna your face is gonna feel like
super like wet at first you can do kind
of like little motions like this like I
like to do like upward strokes like kind
of very gentle on my skin and my neck
all like a lifting motion to help lift
and I make sure it's all absorbed before
I go in with the nagas oil and then I'll
go in with the two eye products again
make sure they're kind of drying in
between each step that way your skin is
really absorbing the product and then
I'll go in with my night cream the one
that I've been using is by rodeo it's
the bee venom and placenta 24 karat gold
cream I love the rodeo skincare brand I
have a lot of products by them but I've
been kind of sticking to these ones as
of now but this night cream I love and I
mean bee venom and placenta
I don't know it sounds a little bit
crazy but it seems to be working really
nicely for me so I really do love this
product for pimples what I've been using
which I'll apply this usually first and
then I'll put like my serums and stuff
around it that way my skin absorbs it
I've been using the Kate Somerville
erotic Kate acne treatment it's good
it's definitely better than the Mario
Badescu one in my opinion I was using
that one for so long and I think my skin
kind of got used to it but this one when
I put it on it kind of like burns the
acne spot a little bit so I feel like
it's really working
but again I have a love
relationship with this product sometimes
it works sometimes it doesn't as far as
masks go I am NOT like a huge mask
person I have two that I go back in
Northwest where is the other one this
one is literally I'm gonna have to
replace it it's by image skincare it's
called ageless total resurfacing mask
this brand I also heard about when I was
getting my facials at my last spot place
and I also recently picked up the
one-one-one skin gold brightening facial
treatment masks so I think there's five
yeah there's five and each container of
these I thought it was just one in it so
I bought like two of them and now I have
ten masks which is fine I'm not
complaining about it but I'll always use
this before like a big event like for
instance before my birthday I use this
before my pop-up shop both nights I use
this and I really really love that
they're like the masks that make you
look all funny so it's not like you just
apply it it's like an actual sheet mask
I've never noticed like insane changes
from using masks but when I want to
treat myself and just treat my skin a
little bit better than normal
I'll definitely go reach for those two
mask products so that is it as far as
what I use on my face I know it might
seem like a lot of products but I use
every single one of them every single
night like I can't even skip it it's
something that I'm super anal about and
I think it's paid off I think my skin
looks really good for my age I mean when
I have no makeup on people think I'm a
lot younger obviously with makeup I look
older which is fine but as far as my
body I have a few products that I really
love as well and as you guys know I
suffer from eczema but it has been so
much better the past probably like six
or seven months I wanted to talk about
first I think I mentioned this one time
it's called a HIPAA cleanse and it's
like this doctor soap it's an anti
septic anti microbial skin cleanser
whenever my eczema is like bright red
and kind of like oozing a little bit
which I know that sounds really gross
but it has
been that way in a while so I haven't
used it but I wanted to talk to you guys
about it because it has helped me so
much when I was like dying of my eczema
this product cannot be used on your face
so if you do have eczema on your face I
would not recommend it I would also
maybe talk to a dermatologist or read
the directions make sure you're using it
only on spots that you're able to but
I've used it on my hands on my stomach
my legs really anywhere that I would
break out and it really really helped me
when I was suffering really bad for body
wash I have about 12 of these under my
sink I stock up because I go through
these really quickly as well this is by
derma e and it's called the serosa body
wash and it is good for psoriasis and
eczema and this is the only product that
I will use I don't use anything with
fragrance or anything like that because
it irritates my skin I have very
sensitive skin to begin with so this
product is definitely like my Holy Grail
Body Wash I've gone through probably
like 15 bottles of this already and I
have like I said a bunch of them stocked
up under my sink when it comes to body
cream as soon as I get out of the shower
I put body cream from my neck down and
the two that I have been loving the
ultra Repair Cream by first aid beauty
has been an all time favorite I've used
this forever this one's empty and I
don't have any backups so I have to buy
a few more but I also have been using
the skin fix soothing body cream it's
good for eczema and I have been using
this for probably like seven months now
this is like my third bottle of this as
well and I love it because it's not too
thick it's not too sticky but it's again
kept my skin really nice and I haven't
had any breakouts really I mean a little
bit on my hands but nowhere else in a
really long time now and I'm so excited
about it because I know I talked about
it when I was really struggling and it
was brutal so anyone who has eczema I
feel you it sucks and I have found that
these products really really
to me I also have one other product that
when my eczema was super bad I was using
I haven't used it in a while because it
is a very thick cream and it was good
for when I was like broken out really
bad so this is called premium triple
cream it's a severe dry skin eczema care
and it could be used on babies and one
of my subscribers actually recommended
this to me so I wanted to say thank you
because this really really helped me
when my skin was bad so the last part
that I'm gonna talk about isn't really
skincare but it's something I use on my
body all the time and I have mentioned
it before it's my Vita liberato a body
blur and I use it in the medium latte
color I have gone through probably like
7 bottles of this I have it on my skin
right now it gives you like a nice tan
and a little bit of a glow and I swear
when I apply this on my leg it's like
I'll do one leg and then I'll look in
the mirror and I'll be like why can't my
skin just really look like this so it's
amazing it doesn't have too much of a
shimmer in it but it just makes your
body and your skin just look at flawless
so any time I'm going out usually when
I'm filming I'll have this product on
and it is amazing so I highly highly
recommend this as well so that is it for
now those are my top favorite skincare
products that I have been absolutely
loving for quite a while now so I backup
every single product 100% they have my
stamp of approval I personally love them
and I feel like my skin has never been
better
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
wanted to say thank you so much for all
of the love and support on my last video
you guys have no idea how much it means
to me and I just feel so unbelievably
honored and blessed that I have all of
you in my life so thank you so much I
love you guys so so so so much more than
you'll ever
and until next time I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
