today's video I'm going to show you how
I get my full coverage oil-free makeup
foundation routine it's been a little
bit since I have done a full face look
so today I'm gonna be focusing all on
the skin and I just showed you guys are
really quick eye makeup look as well
I've been using these products for the
past month or so and they really helped
keep my oil to the minimum my skin that
is sometimes dry and my skin is
sometimes oily but I feel like during
the summer months
I tend to be more oily than dry so I
found a really good routine that works
for me when I was in the Bahamas because
it was super hot over there so I figured
I would show you my full face look so if
you guys want to see how I got this full
coverage oil-free foundation routine
then please keep watching start off
today's look I'm using the skin Danai
via oil control makeup priming spray so
you're gonna want to shake this before
you use it and this is the first step on
how we're gonna prevent an oily face
throughout the day so this product along
with one other which I'll talk about in
a few minutes are definitely key on
controlling your oil throughout the day
so this is the priming spray and we're
gonna spray that all over our face I
always like a little extra I like making
sure every part of my face feels damn
it's also super refreshing you guys can
throw any facial spray in the fridge and
it'll be even cooler on your skin which
is always nice so the next step is
optional but if you guys want to like
blur out your pores kind of mattify your
face before you get going I've been
using the cover FX blurring primer so
I'm just means a little bit and only
apply it on the areas that I need it so
literally just a small melt and I'm
gonna apply it here on my nose so you
could see how it already instantly
mattifies I like applying this in a
downwards motion that way if you guys
have any hairs on your face it's just
gonna smooth everything out so I'm gonna
apply it on my cheeks right in this
of my forehead and then also my chin
next up we're gonna go in with
foundation this one is my Kat Von D it's
the Lockett foundation and it's a full
coverage matte finish foundation so one
thing I would recommend staying away
from our luminous foundations dewy
foundations anything like that if you
guys do have extra oily skin or just
oily skin in general obviously we like
to have a little bit of a glow but I
would stick with a whole matte face and
then you can always add a highlighter in
the areas that you want that's just
something I personally always do I love
a good matte foundation so I'm going to
pump a little bit on the back of my hand
and I'm going to just dot it on my face
so another thing that I recommend if you
guys do have oily skin before blending
everything in on your face you can spray
the oil control setting spray on your
Beauty Blender that way it's preparing
your skin for as much control as
possible the one that I'm using is also
by Scandinavia it's the makeup finishing
spray the oil control one as well so
this one is amazing I use this everyday
when I was in the Bahamas because it was
super super hot there and I really
really love this stuff so what you're
going to do is just shake it as well and
then just spray it onto your Beauty
Blender
so I'm gonna go back in before I move on
with the makeup finishing spray and
really quickly I wanted to talk about
this a little bit this product was
actually one of the first setting sprays
I've ever used in my makeup career I
used to use the Bridal one all the time
on my clients for big events and
everything like that so when I started
using this one again it just brought
back a lot of old memories what's really
cool about this product that I only
recently found out is they designed it
to last all day long so I know all
setting sprays say that that's what they
do
but this actual product is formulated in
such a tedious way there are tiny
capsules in this that release throughout
the day that way it continues to work
it's not just like a one-time thing
looks good for maybe an hour and that's
it so it was super intriguing and I have
been loving it so far so I really wanted
to just let you guys know that because a
lot of the setting sprays are just kind
of like a facial mist where this is
actually working to keep your makeup
oil-free and looking good for the entire
day for two weeks I have a code to get
you guys 25% off the entire website and
you'll also get two little mini sized
sprays as well which is really cool so
if you guys do want to try it out again
it's for two weeks so I will list all
those details below I'm just gonna
spritz a little bit more on my face
for contour i'm using this darkest shade
in my graftobian cream foundation
palette I'm going to contour my nose as
I always do
I'm gonna do my cheeks so again this is
a full-coverage oil-free routine you can
use a lot less product you don't need to
do this obviously but I wanted to do
like a full coverage look just to show
you guys that even if you have oily skin
you can still do a full coverage makeup
look there's just certain products that
help keep it mattified all day for
concealer today I'm using the shape tape
in medium and I'm just gonna apply that
down the sides of my nose and then also
under my eyes
and we are gonna blend that in with a
beauty blender
and as I'm blending any like excess
product I just like dab onto my towel
find you have too much no worries
and then I'm gonna blend in the contour
I really love the graftobian contour
colors because they're super super
lightweight and creamy so they're not
super oily like some of the other
products that I do use I feel like some
people are afraid to use like super
creamy products when they do have oily
skin but I'm telling you guys that it's
totally fine it's just all about how you
set it the powders that you use and all
that so I'll go through every little
step throughout the video
you
to set under my eyes I'm using the Kat
Von D translucent setting powder so
first some without any creases
so while I'm letting all this powders
soak in you know it's like a lot of
powder but don't worry I'm going to fill
in my brows so since this video is
strictly about the foundation routine
I'm gonna snap my fingers and my brows
are gonna be done now I'm going to take
my brush I'm just gonna buff in all of
this powder
so guess what we're gonna go back in
with the setting spray any time I wake
walk all the powder I like to add a
little bit more moisture that way
everything can kind of melt together and
by adding another layer of this well
control one it's just gonna help build
your makeup and help keep it again more
oil-free so I'm just gonna go in a
little more I'm just gonna let that dry
and again it's just gonna melt all the
product together so next to bronze up my
face you just want to use any type of
matte bronzer you don't want to use
anything with a shimmer or like a sheen
to it with my Sigma e45 brush I'm gonna
pick up a little bit of those same
shades and go over my nose contour as
well
I'm gonna use a little bit of the medium
contour and I'm just going to apply that
into my crease I'm gonna keep my eyes
really simple today because I really
wanted to just focus on my face and my
face routine can't buy my Charlotte
Tilbury liner so I'm just gonna go in
with the physician's formula for lashes
I'm using the iconic lights this makeup
I'm doing right now is very similar to
this picture right here and a lot of
people are asking so I figured I would
do it in today's video just to show you
guys really quickly all that I used I'm
not even using my palette and as some of
you guys hate when I use it because I
always use it but again I created a
palette I can use every day so this is
literally what I do every single day so
I'm using just the brown in my crease
and then the shimmer Brown and the dark
brown and this orange so these four
shades are gonna all go on my lower lash
line so to prevent fallout you can use
your makeups right so I'm just gonna
spray a little bit right onto a
different palette and then I'm gonna dip
my brush nib so I'm gonna take the matte
dark brown and just apply that
connecting it to the eyeliner then I'm
going in with the shimmer Brown I love
this color on my lower lash line you
know what I lied I'm not going to use
the lighter matte that I just used in my
crease I'm just gonna go in with a
little bit of a larger smudge brush and
I'm gonna grab that orange shade from
the top row and I'm gonna put it right
under the Browns for mascara I'm using
this one by Tarte
we're going to apply a little bit more
powder underneath my eyes to do the
bottom mascara so next I'm just gonna
highlight my nose I'm trying out the new
dose of colors away go highlighter by
desi and Katy it's the first time I'm
actually trying it out so I'm super
excited I've always always always pretty
really pretty always highlight my nose
so if you guys get a super oily nose and
you don't want to contour to highlight
it that's completely up to you it's all
about trial and error but since this is
a full-coverage routine this is
something that I will always always do
it's how they're so beautiful it's super
pigmented I'm barely even touching it
with my brush I'm gonna apply a little
bit in here to my tear duct and then a
little bit there as well and for lips I
really really wanted to try the color
hot-fire also by desi and Katy it's like
a beautiful bright bright orange and I
know fall is almost here so I'm gonna
get my summer colors in as long as
possible so before I go any further I'm
actually gonna line my lips first this
is a Go Go lip liner by Kat Von D
for blush I'm using mellow wine by
wet-and-wild it's like a peachy color
and it's matte of course
and we're gonna finish it off with the
oil control makeup finishing spray one
last time and this finishing spray is
really gonna keep your makeup in place
all day while also controlling the oil
on your skin as well now that I'm
dressed I'm gonna apply a little bit of
highlighter just on my chest
big collarbones using the same hue go
and that is it
so this is the final result I hope you
