those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and today I'm going to be
giving you a little tour of my living
room so when I first moved into this
house this room that I have is my living
room was an office this big entry
wedding which I will show you guys a
minute was like a little door so I
really transformed this room and I'm
very proud of how it came out my dad
calls it the Angie room because
everything is grain white and it's like
fluffy and both flowers and it's just
literally like the most girly room ever
and I'm obsessed so right when you walk
in my front door this is the first room
we kind of see so I wanted it to be
really beautiful and bright so I figured
I would give you guys a tour show you
where I got everything and everything
that I did get I will link below if it
is still in stock if not I'll just let
you know where I got it but when I first
was in I was super stressed out because
I did not think I was good at interior
design at all so instead of hiring a
designer and after paying like an
obscene amount of money I ended up
returning like half the things that they
suggested and I ended up doing it myself
and I guess it took that little lesson
for me to realize that I can do it
myself it just takes a little bit of
time and you just have to like plan out
what you want to do it's always great to
get inspiration online there's so many
different amazing Instagram accounts as
well as websites that give you different
inspiration and show you different room
setups you can kind of get ideas that
way so I hope this video will be helpful
for those of you guys maybe looking to
design a specific room in your house and
I'm going to share a bunch of my
favorite websites as well so if you guys
want to see my living room then please
keep watching
so the first thing I did when I moved in
was I opened up this wall right here it
was like a double door into an office
and I knew I wanted it to be super open
one of the main reasons that I fell in
love with this house was the staircase
the floating staircase it was just what
I was looking for so when there was a
wall here I kind of defeated the purpose
because I was like well if I want to
walk underneath my staircase and at my
living room like I want to be able to do
that so we opened up the wall and we
matched the molding from the opposite
side which is the dining room side so
that way it looked more grand and more
open and beautiful the first thing that
I did was I painted the room which
usually you should pick up furniture and
then paint the walls but I just needed
the red out it was like a deep deep red
and the ceiling was all like a light
beige and I knew I wanted it gray and
white so I painted the walls like a
light gray I have to check on the paint
color I know I have in the basement so I
will check for you guys so after I
opened all of that up the first thing
that I did purchase in this room is this
couch behind me online it looked gray so
I ordered it and when it showed up like
three weeks later it was like a light
ivory color so I was a little
disappointed because it's really hard to
buy furniture online because sometimes
when you get it it's not gonna be the
exact same color is how you see it so I
ended up reaching out to the
manufacturer which is hot house and I've
had them custom make the exact couch in
a different color I know now because
I've seen them they're offering so many
more options of these types of couches
that aren't custom that are probably a
little bit cheaper but when I bought
this 20 half years ago I feel like there
weren't very many light gray couch
options so we'll start from left to
right these dark chairs here were
actually one of the second things that I
got after I got the couch and I was a
little bit worried because as you can
see the gray of the chairs versus the
gray of the couch they're pretty far off
these are more of like a warm beige gray
while the couch is more of like an AC
gray so what actually ended up working
was I had this rug that was in my living
room that I actually moved in here and
it kind of brought together all of the
different grades so it all worked out
nicely so these chairs I don't remember
exactly where they're from
I know they are from online so I will
link them once I find them but they are
like a velvety fabric and they have the
acrylic legs so I didn't really know
what could go in this corner so the
chairs and the acrylic table was
actually picked out by my designer and
he thought that it would be cute to just
have like a little loungy sitting area
so that's what we did over here we have
the acrylic table again I will link it
for you guys I don't know off the top of
my head where it's from but on this
little table I have two little perfume
holders that I got from Zee gallery and
then I have a cute little picture frame
of my little cousin Colin and B Umbra I
send curtains for me are like the
scariest thing that's why I don't have
any curtains in here because I feel like
those need to be done laughs so you can
tie the whole room together so I never
ended up doing curtains in here but I
probably would have done like probably
like a darker dragged her in to be
honest so right here is my foyer so
right in this little corner I put these
cute little vases they are from Pier 1
and the faux flowers in them are from
Michaels I just thought it was a cute
little way to I don't know decorate that
corner so these little end tables are
definitely one of my favorite pieces
that end tables and the coffee tables in
this room so I put two little candle
holders and some crystals on them to
keep it kind of simple but yet sparkly
at the same time so the crystals are
from all over I have a couple shops
around my house as well as home goods
that sell them and then the candle
holders are actually from Crate and
Barrel as well as the candles on top of
them so as I mentioned before hey bow
this rug was actually originally in my
other room but it was a drop too small I
needed one size bigger but it didn't
come one size bigger for my family room
so I ended up trying it in here and it
worked out really well because it
brought together the gray of the couch
to the gray of the chairs which I really
loved so I think it just fits perfectly
in this room I originally wanted like a
white fluffy like a faux fur type of rug
but I couldn't find one that was white
enough so this rug actually ended up
working out perfectly so next I have my
coffee tables this is one of the hardest
things for me to find because the couch
is abnormally long so I found these on
and they are from the brand I don't know
how to pronounce it I think it's like I
like cults and I loved it because it was
two smaller ones put together so the
length of it is longer than any coffee
table that I was able to find for some
reason they don't make coffee tables
that long at least on the websites that
I was looking for so on this side I have
three little jars that I got from Crate
and Barrel and I wasn't sure what I was
going to put in them but I ended up
putting just some candles in them I
thought that looks really cute and then
on this side I have a little mirrored
tray that I put some of my favorite
crystals on and those crystals again I
got from some crystal shops and a couple
of them are actually from home goods so
I knew I wanted to put some decorative
books in here and I found the most
perfect book look at this book how it
matches so perfectly to the rug so I
will link where I got all of these um
but I just absolutely love this I love
all the books for decorative purposes I
bought so many of them and I actually
bought a lot of them online on Amazon I
was in Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and I was looking
at prices online as I was in the store
and they were like half price for some
of them so they always fight when
they're close children what are we
dealing in here and mommy's trying to
work so we can move on to the table that
my cats are sitting on so the table I'll
show you in a minute is an acrylic table
that was supposed to go against this
wall over here but I just hated how it
looked so I ended up putting it behind
so as you can hopefully kind of see it's
like an acrylic thin thin table that I
have behind the couch I put my two
little lamps on it and then I have some
books and some faux flowers up there as
well
I thought the lamps looks better there
as opposed to on the end tables I think
it just looked a little bit better in my
opinion so this is gonna end bad
hey hey
Oh see I knew it and then over here on
this side of the room I have again
another end table we have some crystals
on the bottom there and then on top I
have this really cute horse head that I
got from home goods on the floor I just
have it's like a little lantern that's
from Pier one and I believe the candles
are also Pier one so I just kind of
placed them there on the floor and then
over here on this wall I have this
little painting that is from Pier one as
well so these little trees were like an
afterthought when I was at the AMC
gallery I saw these these were like a
new addition so I was like I wonder how
that will look so I bought them not
knowing if I was gonna keep them or not
and when they came I just thought they
looked so beautiful and it just kind of
made the room super I don't know like
airy and free and bright I don't know I
just really love like the whole vibe of
this room so then over here this was
kind of like an afterthought it ended up
being like a little bit too why it comes
up a little further than my molding but
it's fine because I wanted to add like
some mirrored stuff in here as well so
this mirror that's right here was
originally supposed to go where this
painting was but again I didn't like how
it was all working so I ended up putting
this mirror over here I felt it was too
thin for that wall so when I had at home
they hung it too high and if I moved it
down you can see the other holes so it's
a little bit higher than I would have
liked but it's okay whatever barely even
look in this mirror anyway but I have
this little mirror unit that I got from
I have to check it might have been
overstock.com
and then I just have some like random
little crystals some books some candle
holders again more books and little like
what are these called Oh little like
bosses these are from Pier 1 so the
chandelier that I have in here was
actually originally in my kitchen above
my breakfast area but I went like
a different direction in the breakfast
area so I end up bringing the chandelier
in here because I knew I wanted
something really similar anyway and one
of my favorite parts of this room like
my absolute favorite is the ceiling all
of these moldings were originally here
but like I said the little squares in
between were all pane and beige so it
just I don't know if I painted all white
just made it all look so beautiful in my
opinion so that is what my favorite
things about this room so that is the
tour of my angel room which is my living
room I hope you guys enjoyed this video
again everything that I remember where I
got it from will be listed below which
basically I think I remember everything
because it's not too long ago that I did
purchase it I hope this video gave me
some ideas maybe if you guys are
decorating a certain room in your house
and remember just because you can't
envision the whole room finish that's ok
like I did this in pieces and so many
pieces that I bought for other areas I
ended up moving around and that's kind
of how this room came together like I
said earlier I really did not think I
could do interior design at all and I
ended up doing my entire house well
almost my entire house I never fully
finished it so that is it for now
