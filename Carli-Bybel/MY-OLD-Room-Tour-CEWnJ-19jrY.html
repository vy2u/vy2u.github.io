autumn breeze boom sun shining on my
face tangle thoughts I hear a
Mockingbird sing really ain't that bad
on my door I made a sign and it says
please take responsibility for the
energy you bring into this space I saw
this on Oprah and I love the quote so
that's it's on my door so this is my
room welcome this is my new bell it's
from ASOS and has spikes on it and it's
so cute I'm obsessed and this quote
right here I put on myself it's a
sticker it says if you are confident you
are beautiful I got this from Michael's
craft store and I just decorated a
little extra and this is my makeup case
it's all packs because I have been a
little bit busy lately so I just keep it
on here and they're all my brushes where
I'm keeping all my necklaces on the
sides of this but I'm trying to get rid
of this ugly thing so I just need to
find a new jewelry holder and here is
where all the magic happens this is my
vanity you can purchase this at vanity
girl Hollywood calm by I love this
because it has tons of space and it also
has holes for your dryers or curling
irons in your straightener this I also
made on my wall there are some flowers
and a quote that says always kiss me
goodnight and of course the beautiful
Marilyn love her she watches over my
room this is my bedspread and force my
Louboutins this is a painting that I did
my senior year of high school that I
still have and a cute drawing from Sam's
little sister Kathy I just have some
nice quotes up here and of course
penguins are up here as well and this
one is one of my favorite
it says any given moment can change your
life you just have to be there I got all
these cards when I was on vacation one
year and I just loved all them so I
saved them and here's a picture of me
and my baby cousin Danny when we were
little I kind of ran out of room in my
closet so I just pinned some of my bags
on my wall like this I love my new
jewelry holder for my rings my bracelets
they're so cute and I just put them
right on my dresser so I can just look
at all my jewelry my favorite are
definitely these gold spikes that I just
got they're amazing I've all my gold my
silver black and gold and then all my
watches and my rings right here I have
all my dresses and all my robbers all
went are these were my jackets and all
my Blazers but I decided to switch them
out with my colorful dresses and this is
my penguin family they have room over
there in the corner I finally cleaned
out my closet so I bought my shoes on
this side my shorts my skirts hanging
here and then I have all my Blazers my
jackets and any vests on this side and
this is my favorite side all my shoes I
got a new shoe rack
I love these neon shoes that I just got
to they were like 25 dollars and I have
my fur jackets always on the right
because they are not needed and I just
have all my shirts blouses and anything
like that on this side of the closet so
