today I'm back with another video for
you guys I leave tomorrow morning at 8
a.m. so I wanted to get up one more
video before I left today I want to show
you guys my sneaker collection I've been
obsessed with sneakers the past couple
of years and not only are they just so
comfy but I just think they're so cute
as well so I figured today I would show
you guys some of the sneakers in my
collection if you guys like this idea
let me know and then I couldn't show you
guys all my other shoes as well I may
have to cut those into like two videos
maybe do like all blacks and darks and
then like lighter colors because I have
a lot of shoes so if you want to see
some of the sneakers in my collection
please keep watching
you can see like how this is kind of
lifted and that's just because that's my
like curly roots so that's why you want
to make sure you focus on the top that
way it flattens out like so I'm just
going to like make sure under here is
super straight as well right by the
roots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
