high play ready I'm ready Blaine Oh
almost like hi everyone thank you for
watching so you could just smile and
like you want to wave like yeah I get
with my ha yeah ready 1 2 hi everybody
thank you for watching today I'm here
with the beautiful Haley this is Bret's
cousin basically my cousin too and we've
been talking about doing this video for
how long now like a year we wanted to do
a tutorial for girls out there who wear
glasses and I did a really pretty look
that I think kind of matched her outfit
so you guys can incorporate different
colors if you want but it feels good out
of your glasses right like they're not
touching nothing oh cool so if you guys
want to learn how I got this look please
keep watching
good morning zone to start any makeup
look off you want to apply a moisturizer
on your face before you apply the primer
that way you're kind of creating a
barrier to prime her face I'm using by
Maybelline the master prime blur and
smooth this was the first time that I
was using it I think I have to try it on
myself to give you an honest opinion on
how I feel about it but I wanted to do
mostly drugstore products for this look
so moving on to her face I'm mixing the
new Rimmel BB cream along with this NYX
illuminator to give her a pretty glow
and I'm applying this all over her face
with a foundation brush first and then
I'm blending everything in with a damp
Beauty Blender and I saw some people
asking why you use a damp and the reason
is it's not going to soak up as much
product but it's going to be so easy to
blend your foundation like if you don't
have one you need one
for concealer I'm using the Tarte
creaseless concealer in the color light
and I'm applying this underneath her
eyes don't be afraid to use concealer if
you guys wear glasses one thing I wanted
to let you guys know is that a lot of
looks you can still do with you have
glasses I know sometimes your glasses
are going to cover it but I figured I
would do this tutorial specifically so
that way I can point out any tips that I
would recommend if you guys are going to
be using a creamy concealer I definitely
recommend sending it with powder because
otherwise once you put your glasses on
it's probably just going to slide and
it's going to go all over the place so
that's one of the biggest things people
don't realize is that if you're going to
use a concealer like this you want to
set it with a loose powder see if you
look alike okay before I set up a
grandma you do I think you think it's
all a today no look again Holly never I
never get that has a click and Holly
mother deliver
I'm not wear any makeup even though
everybody thinks I'm yeah somebody asked
me that they're like this brower makeup
one into everyone I know I wear today
I'm using the laura mercier setting
powder and you can see how it just
instantly mattifies her face so it's
going to help prevent anything from
moving which is what we want especially
when we have glasses so I'm just
applying that anywhere that the
concealer was moving on to her brows
first I'm just combing them up and I'm
using the Anastasia Pro brow kit if you
guys are freelance artists you need this
because it has literally every single
shade so since she has a beautiful
reddish tint to her hair I'm going to be
using the color Auburn and I'm just
filling in her brows so now moving on to
eyes it's important to use some sort of
eye shadow primer because sometimes our
eyelids get oily and again we want to
keep everything in place so this one I
believe is by bare minerals there's a
few other ones that are really good I'll
list them below that are drugstore
options I think when you wear glasses
the main thing that you're going to see
is the eyelids so I wanted to go with a
nice shimmery shade that's gonna really
stand out for this look she really
wanted a cat eye and I think doing a cat
eye liner is smart for when you have
glasses because it's gonna really stand
out and it's gonna make your eyes look a
little bit bigger and it's also gonna
make you look a little bit more sultry
so I am using the tattoo liner by Kat
Von D I love this one it's pretty long
where I think it's one of my favorites
at the moment and I think it's important
to stay away from a regular eyeliner
like a cream eyeliner because those tend
to smudge and we want our makeup to stay
in place especially with glasses with a
pencil brush I'm picking up the color
sexy which is a dark plum color and I
had to use this color because her shirt
was plum her hair is a gorgeous plum
color and it just goes with her feature
so well so I'm applying this right on
the outer V so I'm going to emphasize
that cat eye by just applying that right
on the outer V kind of in the shape of
her eyeliner so I'm taking a little bit
of this brown shimmer color and I'm very
lightly applying that in the crease just
to kind of open up her eyes a little bit
and it's gonna just
look bigger which I think the goal is
especially with glasses because
sometimes they can make your eyes look a
little bit smaller we want to really
open them up so I am repeating the same
steps on the other eye I like to use
something with a flat edge like this to
really make the cat eye look perfect
with a clean blending brush I'm just
blending all of that in then with a
pencil brush and the color seductive
again I'm just lightly applying this on
her lower lash line
so now moving on to mascara just a tip
for people applying mascara on other
people I always like to comb them down
first and then comb them up it's gonna
make them look thicker in this case we
don't want her lashes to too long so I'm
just applying one or two coasts so they
are nice and thick so they do stand out
from a far distance and then to bronze
up her face a little bit I'm using the
NYX contour kit and I'm applying that on
the sides of her forehead on her cheeks
on her neck and also a little bit on her
shoulders since you can kind of see that
with the way her shirt is and it looks
really harsh right now but again we're
gonna go back and blend that I am
applying this gray tone with a smaller
brush just to very lightly contour her
nose she doesn't even need it but I
always like to just kind of even out the
contour if we're gonna contour the rest
of her face just a little bit on the
nose and I'm just taking this damp
Beauty Blender and just kind of blending
everything in to make it all blend
seamlessly
her blush I'm using this one by Revlon I
think it's called why not and I'm just
applying this on the apples of her
cheeks again for this look I wanted to
keep a lot of cranberries in it so
that's why I chose this blush to
highlight I'm using a pink tone
highlight this one's by Laura Geller and
it's absolutely gorgeous and I'm just
applying that right on her cheekbones
and the best thing about glasses is your
cheekbones still stand out so I say go
for the highlight because it's gonna
really make your cheeks pop her lips I'm
using by NYX in the color natural and
I'm over lining her lips a little bit
she's never used lipliner before so I
was excited to give her a little bit of
a fuller lip and I'm mixing these two
glosses together the first one is
Madison Ave by Gerard cosmetics and then
the one over that is plumb crazy and
then mixed together is just a perfect
plum cranberry color and I think it
looked great with her complexion so of
course this video is for girls with
glasses but I just want to let you guys
know that don't feel like you can't do
certain looks if you wear glasses I say
go for it I say whatever your heart
desires if you want to wear that makeup
you should do it anyway but I just
wanted to do a specific look for girls
out there with glasses plus I just
wanted to get hailey in a video with me
so the last step that I forgot to show
on camera is to apply a setting spray
this is going to lock in your makeup
it's going to keep it on all day and
it's prevent it from smearing from your
glasses nice little head to side
John Wow do you like it what do you
think of the lip color huh
you like it you're a little too dark for
you you like it no I like it yeah sure I
do bag no hey looking good
oh my god you look so good so this is
the final result doesn't she look
gorgeous seriously it looks so beautiful
thing
