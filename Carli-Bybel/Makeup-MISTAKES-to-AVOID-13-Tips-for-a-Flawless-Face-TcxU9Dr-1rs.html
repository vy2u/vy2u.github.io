writing letter spend my evenings singing
song hi everyone so I'm going to be
starting out this tutorial right away
I'm going to be doing half of my face
how I would normally do my makeup and
then I'm going to do the other half of
my face making some mistakes that we've
all made in the past while using makeup
first I'm applying a primer all over the
left side of my face but since you guys
are viewing it as the right side I'm
just going to call it the right side
since it is technically the right side
on how you should do your makeup but
yeah I'm just going to be applying this
on the one side because I really think a
foundation primer is super important and
keeping your makeup on and lasting all
day I always see a ton of people asking
how to choose your right foundation
shade and if you have a tan or if you're
a little bit lighter of course that's
gonna change what I recommend doing is
using the testers and getting it close
to the color that's right on your hand
you don't want to do anything too dark
because you can always use a bronzer to
darken up your face so I always like to
get something maybe a little bit lighter
than my skin tone and then again with
the contouring and the bronzer it really
darkens up your face and it gives it a
really natural look so once you've found
your correct to foundation shade you
just want to apply it all over your face
and this one is number 320 and one thing
that I notice is that my color goes all
the way up to 330 when I do have a tan
so that is why I do have both shades
another tip that I have is to always
always always bring your foundation down
to your neck I think that is one of the
biggest pet peeves I have when you don't
blend everything onto your neck and you
have like a really tan face and then a
white neck it just ruins all the hard
work that you had done so please
remember this one tip because it is
important so now I'm going to show you
what it looks like with the wrong shade
of foundation I think one of the
problems that most people have is
picking out a color that is not right
for them as I had just previously stated
but you will notice that the foundation
if it doesn't match your skin tone right
away you'll notice that your neck is a
complete different color so beware of
this and make sure not to get anything
too dark for your face so now moving on
to brows the new pomades are huge this
year but I keep seeing a lot of people
maybe applying too much of it if you are
using the pomade a little bit goes a
long way you just have to apply a tiny
bit on your brush and this is really to
outline your brows and give them a
fuller shape and then what I like to do
is take a powder to fill it in so it's a
little bit darker I love big brows so
I'm not against big brows or if you like
really shapely brows however you prefer
the shape is completely fine but again
you want them to be natural you don't
want them to look like you just use the
sharpie marker over your eyebrows so
just keep trying till you find the right
color and I promise you'll find it for
this side of the eyebrow I'm using the
pomade in the color
evany and I'm just overly drawing my
eyebrows and making them more square and
I'm not hating if you have this type of
eyebrow because on some people it really
does look good but it's when it's
completely penciled in and it doesn't
look natural that's when it looks crazy
and I have old pictures where I used to
do my eyebrows like this so I have been
there we all have to do it just to learn
our lesson and I finally did and I think
I found the right color for my brows I
know a lot of people disagree and still
think my eyebrows are too thick but I
love big brows always have and I always
will
next I wanted to talk about contouring
because I think contouring your nose and
your face the right way and really
accentuate your features and I know a
lot of people have said my noses look
smaller and I think along with my weight
loss the contouring really does help I
will show you on the other side how I
used to do my face where I would just
apply bronzer on the sides of my face
which really darkened all the shadows
around my nose which in turn made it
look bigger so contouring your face with
the right color can really really
accentuate your features and make your
nose appear smaller so if you decide to
contour you have to highlight as well
and when I contour and highlight I
recommend not only applying your
concealer under your eyes as most people
do but also on the sides of your nose
and the reason to do this is it's really
gonna brighten up your face and it's
gonna help set the concealer apart from
the darker concealer so it's gonna give
it more dimension and make again your
nose appear smaller and your face just
appear a lot brighter if you've seen my
other contour highlight videos I go more
in depth with all of this but I also
highlight on the bridge of my nose and
between my brows around my lips and on
my chin then to set the concealer I'm
going to be using a loose powder and
that is just gonna give it a really
flawless look so as you can see since I
lighten these shadows on the sides of my
nose it does make it appear a lot
smaller so that is the goal we were
looking for in a perfect highlighting
contour so now for this side of the face
we're not going to be contouring at all
but I'm just going to be applying a
little bit of concealer underneath my
eyes and I think that's one of the worst
things you can do because it's gonna
look like a white circle right around
your eyes and then
if you have any darker shadows on your
nose just gonna throw it all off next up
for bronzer I just like to apply it
right on my cheekbones around the sides
of my forehead also on my chin and also
bring it down to your neck you only need
a little bit of bronzer a little bit
goes a long way so don't go bronzer
happy and apply it all over your face
because it's all about highlighting and
contouring in the right parts of your
face to give your face that flawless
finish an important step you can't
forget is to blend everything in and I
like to just use my foundation brush
that way there's no sharp lines for this
side of my face I'm going to be applying
my bronzer all over my cheeks and under
my eyes and on the sides of my nose and
gonna make it look really muddy and this
is always how I used to apply my bronzer
like in the end of middle school and
beginning of high school and I cannot
tell you what I was thinking but if you
were tan that was the best and I just
want to be as tan as possible and of
course you got to forget to add the
bronzer to your neck so you have a nice
sharp line for blush again with the
motto that a little bit goes a long way
I just like to apply a little bit right
over where the bronzer was and just to
give it a little bit of a glow and for
the other side of my face where it's
going to load that blush on and give it
a nice pink circle and obviously I'm
being super dramatic with this but I
just wanted to show you guys the
difference and show you how you do apply
it the right way it can really
accentuate your features we're going to
fast-forward through the eyes a bit
because this part is just me being super
dramatic on how makeup should look you
are gonna try to smoky eye there are
certain ways to do it I wouldn't apply
the black so far up towards your brows I
would keep it as natural as possible and
you can really achieve that by using a
larger shader brush so on the right side
of my face I'm gonna apply and makeup
look that I normally would do and then
on the left side I'm just making a mess
of myself while applying mascara I know
a lot of people don't like the clumpy
lashes that is something I like so and
my makeup book that is something I would
include that Columbia lashes are awesome
but of course everyone thinks
differently and another pet peeve that I
actually have is when you don't apply
mascara to the bottom lashes now that
just maybe me but I really think
applying mascara to the bottom lashes
really finishes off a look so my one tip
I have for you when applying your lip
liner is to just not overdraw your lips
too much we've all done it and we all do
it to make our lips appear larger but
there is a line and we should never
cross it so here on the left side I'm
going to show you how you should not
overdraw your lips because it looks too
fake and it's so obvious and just over
drawing them a little bit will really
give it a fuller look you don't have to
go overboard
so this is the final result as you can
see there is a huge difference and these
are all just simple little tips and
mistakes that we all made in the past
and that we can fix for the future so I
hope maybe you learned something new if
not and you know someone that may need
to learn some of these tricks set in
this video because we're not trying to
be mean here at all we just want to help
other girls out and help our friends out
to realize that there are certain ways
that you can do your makeup to really
accentuate your features I hope this
video helps and I hope maybe you learn
something new I love you guys so much
and until next time I'll see you guys da
