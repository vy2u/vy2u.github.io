today I'm going to be going through some
making mistakes that we've all
personally done in the past just showing
you guys some techniques that I have
learned that have helped me make my
makeup look more flawless so on the
right side of the screen is going to be
the correct way versus the left side of
the screen which is going to be some
mistakes again that we've all made in
the past so on the right side of my face
I'm applying a primer and primer is
super important in order to keep your
makeup in tact all day and it also makes
your makeup go on a lot smoother I
prefer a mattifying base because it
helps blur out all of your pores so I
know what color foundation I am so at
this point I'm just painting on my
normal Make Up For Ever HD foundation
and I like to apply it with a paintbrush
first that way I can make sure it
matches my neck and once it oxidizes you
can make sure that the color matches
perfectly on the left side of my face
I'm applying a foundation that actually
matches my skin once I have a tan but as
you can see it's way too orange E and it
just does not match so I'm applying this
on my face and then I'm going to be
blending this out with my Beauty Blender
on the right side of my face we are
going to be blending it down onto our
neck that's one thing that's super
important when doing your makeup is to
blend whatever foundation onto your neck
so it all blends evenly and it all
matches your chest and doesn't look like
you're wearing a mask one of the main
reasons why I love the Beauty Blender is
it does a lot of the work for you
sometimes with brushes it can leave your
foundation looking a little bit blotchy
but if you use a primer and then you use
the Beauty Blender to help blend it out
it's going to give you a perfect
flawless finish so on this side again
you can instantly see that it is just
way too dark and it does not match my
skin tone so that's one thing to really
keep in mind is when you're finding the
right foundation color just making sure
that it matches you and it doesn't look
like you're wearing a mask so as you can
see it looks really silly because I
didn't blend it down on my neck so
that's just one thing I want you guys to
keep in mind moving onto concealer for
the right side I'm using a concealer
that's probably like one or two shades
lighter than my actual skin tone now
this is something that I did all of the
time I would always use a super super
light concealer because I felt to
highlight and contour you how to use a
really sharp contrast colors so
originally I used to use that and it
just took more time it took more
blending but now what I've noticed is
just you
she ate a little bit lighter still gonna
do the trick it's still going to give
you that flawless finish it's mostly
just to cover up the dark circles and it
just gonna be so much easier on you
you're not gonna have to blend as much
so again when picking the concealer
shade you don't need to go too extreme
also on the wrong / left side of my face
you can see I am just applying this
concealer right under my eyes if you do
it in a downwards triangle it's gonna
help really bring that part of your face
forward making you appear more awake and
just giving you more brightness to your
face which i think is the goal when
people are applying concealer you want
it to really wake you up so if you're
applying it just underneath your eyes
like that you're gonna see the line and
it's just not gonna look cute another
thing you have to remember to do is to
set your concealer that way it doesn't
slide all over the place this is another
trick that I wanted to recommend for you
guys I like to apply it right underneath
my eyes and also under my cheekbone so
moving on to brows I am using my brow
bar to go on the right side of my face
it's my favorite one it's very natural
and it keeps the brows looking just a
little darker but very natural and for
the wrong side or the left side I'm
using the anastacio pomade which is a
really great product if you use it
correctly but it's so easy to take
things a little overboard with the
pomade that's why I stopped using it
because I would notice that my eyebrows
were looking a little bit too fake I
think the goal with makeup is to me look
as natural as possible while really
enhancing your features so that's
another tip that I wanted to give also
if you are using concealer to shape out
your brows make sure your buffing away
that line you can see here I left that
line and it's a pet peeve of mine if I
see anyone with that concealer left on
their brow so just make sure you're
smudging that out now for contouring the
nose this is my little trick that has
worked for me immensely I like to draw
the line a little bit more closer in
towards the center of my nose and where
my actual nose is that way it's gonna
look much more narrow and it kind of
gives the illusion of a smaller nose if
you contour it too far out it's gonna
make your nose look wider it's kind of
hard to see the result because I did
contour one side correctly or how I
prefer it at least so maybe in another
video I can just show you if I were to
contour it wrong like how much of a
difference that it would make I used to
only contour the sides and I feel like
that's why my nose used to look a lot
bigger because I just contoured it wrong
so it's all about figuring out what
looks best
your face so now I'm just wiping off the
excess powder
moving on to bronzer I'm using a shade
that's not too too dark and I'm applying
that on all of the parts that I want to
contour or bronze up a bit a tip that I
have for you guys is to use a very light
hand and slowly build instead of
applying too much product and then
having to buff it out too much so you
can see it just kind of all blends
together nicely for the wrong side I'm
using a really dark shade and I'm going
to give it that muddy look which we've
all had happen before I am guilty of
this as well so I just want you guys to
know that it's all common mistakes we've
all made but with time and with
experience you grow and you learn
different tricks so we don't want
anything look muddy so if you apply a
shade that's not too dark again it's a
lot easier to blend out and it's going
to look a lot more natural you don't
have to do as much work so moving on to
blush I'm just again very lightly
applying this on the apples of my cheeks
and then on the left side I'm applying
just way too much blush
give it a nice clown look you know again
this is a very dramatic interpretation
but you guys get the point so since I
did apply a cream contour shade I am
setting it with a light grayish color
and that's again so the nose contour
stays all day and on the left side I am
using the darkest shade and I am really
enhancing the side part of my nose which
again is gonna help make your nose look
wider so it's all about just figuring
out what shape you want to make your
nose with the contour and then going
from there and another thing that you
guys want to remember to do is if you
are contouring your nose you want to
drag that into your crease so it all
flows nicely and it doesn't look choppy
so for this video I really wanted to
focus on the face so I'm just gonna do
like a dramatic random I look I'm just
gonna do a normal eyeliner and then I'm
gonna do a crazy extended line on this
side so you can just see how eyeliner
can really help shape your eyes the way
that I did it on the right side it's
going to help really open up my eyes and
make them look bigger and just really
sultry as opposed to the left side
that's going to kind of close up my eye
and
yeah so the eyes don't really pay much
attention to you we wanted to really
focus on the face for this video so for
lips I always over line them it's just
something that I like to do but there is
a way to over line them and then there's
a way to take it a little bit overboard
and it could start looking a little bit
awkward so I just wanted to let you guys
know that if you want to try and make
your lips look bigger all the power to
you just try and do it the right way and
try and make it look as natural as
possible so yeah I mean again we've all
been guilty of this sometimes I draw
over draw them a little bit too much and
it's a little bit extreme but it's all
about just figuring out what you prefer
your preference how you like your own
makeup and really doing it that way so I
don't want you guys to think that this
is me saying that my way is the only way
I am not telling you that everything I'm
doing is the correct way it's just
different tricks that I've learned that
I personally feel have helped make my
makeup look more flawless more natural
and yeah so for the highlighter you
could see sometimes we go a little
overboard and you don't need too much
the key is again to keep it looking
national and keep it looking simple and
just really enhancing your own features
so here you can see the left side which
is looking super crazy versus the right
side which i think looks pulled together
nicely so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you learn something new
remember these are all mistakes we've
all made but if we didn't make those
mistakes we wouldn't learn from them so
I hope you guys enjoyed I love you all
so much
and until next time I'll see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
