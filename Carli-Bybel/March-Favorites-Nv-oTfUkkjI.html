it's been about two months since I've
done a favorites video so I figured I
would do my March favorites and then
include maybe some favorites that I had
from February that I haven't talked
about yet or maybe that I've used in my
tutorials and just really haven't talked
about but really quickly before I get
into this video I wanted to let everyone
know if you guys are attending in New
York City IMATS
please come say hello to me because I
really really would love to meet you
guys and just squeeze you and yeah I
can't wait so for anyone attending on
Saturday I will be at the velour lashes
booth and I will be there from 1 to 3
p.m. I'm sure I'll be walking around a
little bit before and after that time so
if you do see me please say hello I
would love to take a picture and for
those of you attending on Sunday I will
be at the Sigma booth which is number
834 from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. so if you are
going either days and now you know where
I will be so there's no excuses why we
cannot meet and I'm really excited to
meet you guys again I'll be there both
days and yeah I think that's basically
all I wanted to talk about today and if
you want to learn some of my favorites
please keep watching I recently just
picked up this new lipstick by Mac and
this one is called peach sock and I
think this is the perfect nude gloss for
someone with a tan or someone with
darker skin I was using myth and creme
day nude and a few others for a really
long time and I loved those nude lips
but as soon as I got a tan from vacation
I noticed that they look too white
against my skin tone so I went out and I
picked up this color peach stock and
it's the perfect color nude I think for
a little bit darker skin so for those of
you looking for a great nude lipstick I
definitely recommend this one I actually
have it on right now what I did was I
lined my lips with my tawny lip liner
then I applied the peach stock all over
my lips and then right in the center of
my top and bottom lip
I applied pink love by Milani so this
was also another one of my favorites I
couldn't open it it's a really really
pretty pink color and it actually
matches this top perfectly but just to
add like a little bit of an ombre kind
of look
when I mixed together for my lips and
then on top of that I just added the
whitening lightening nude gloss which is
obviously one of my favorites if you
guys follow any of my tutorials the next
product I wanted to talk about is
absolutely amazing and one thing that I
like to do when the weather starts
getting warmer is I always like to mix a
highlighter or an illuminator with my
foundation and the reason I like to do
that is because it gives your face a
really pretty glow finish and I actually
just came across this new BB cream it's
called BB + illumination and it's by
Gerard cosmetics it has the illuminator
in it so instead of mixing an
illuminator with my foundation I'll just
pull this one out and I've been using
this the past I don't know three weeks
because I just recently got it but I
really really love it so for those of
you guys in the market for a BB cream
and maybe an illuminator if you really
want that glowy finish definitely try
out this BB + it's awesome I'll do a
tutorial using this so you guys can
actually see it in action my next
favorite is by Estee Lauder and this one
is in heatwave and it's an illuminating
powder jelly so it's not powder and it's
not like a jelly consistency it's kind
of a mixture of both and I've been
loving the illuminators like crazy this
year they're perfect to just add right
onto your cheekbones to give yourself a
nice bronze or summer glow and this one
is more bronze II so this is what it
looks like and again I just like to
apply this right on my cheeks and it
finishes off any look another
illuminator that I recently picked up
from Sephora is by Stella Cosmetics and
it's called all over shimmer liquid
Luminizer and this one is in the color
kin shimmer and like I mentioned
previously sometimes I like to mix a
illuminator with my foundation so before
I got that BB cream in February I was
using this one which is amazing and it
has a little brush on the end so you can
just apply a couple little dots if you
want to apply it after your foundation
or you can mix it with your foundation
but these ones are really really great
and I find my
constantly grabbing for this and I'm not
sure how much they are but I will be
linking everything of course as usual on
my blog so in a lot of my recent
tutorials I've seen a bunch of you guys
suggesting that I go out and try a black
eyelash adhesive and I did notice
probably along with you guys that
sometimes when you look down you can see
like a white almost line where you put
your false lashes and I think about I'm
gonna say five six years ago I had tried
out a dark eyelash adhesive and to be
honest it did not work for me it would
just barely barely stick and then after
a few minutes my eyelashes would come
off so that's really why I've always
been interested in the white colored
glue just I felt it was more sticky but
I actually just recently went out and
bought this one by duo and it has black
glue in it so it does make it a lot less
visible on your eyes I already lost the
cap and I don't know what it is but any
little container that I have like this
whether it's neosporin my eye cream
anything that looks like this I lose the
caps and it's really funny because
that's one thing Brett hates about me
like water bottles I lose the caps they
end up like under our covers in our bed
or like underneath the towel on the
floor it's just so weird I don't know
where they go but I guess when I unscrew
them I kind of just misplace them and
then they get knocked over and then
never to be found again so luckily it
still works a little piece usually dries
up at the top and then I have to just
pull it out before each use but the
black glue is very sticky so if any of
you guys were a little hesitant or maybe
had tried it in the past I give you guys
my approval because it does work just as
good if not better than the white glue
so there were two lip glosses and one
lipstick that I picked up from the
drugstore that I've been using a lot and
I really really love the first one is by
Maybelline and this one is called raw
reveal and these are limited editions so
if any of you guys wanted to try them
definitely go check it out but it's a
really really nice nude color and
besides that I picked up two lip glosses
that are also by Maybelline and they're
side by side and I couldn't decide which
one I wanted
I picked up both but they're really
pretty color the light pink and ones
like a purpley pink but I love these two
glosses the colors are 105 and 110 the
next product is by Anastasia Beverly
Hills and it is the dip brow pomade in
dark brown and I've been using this a
ton lately if you guys saw I recently
posted an updated browser toriel and I
showed you how I used it and what I use
it for and it's so amazing and I don't
think this has been in my favorites
video because I just recently tried them
out but I am loving them I use the
pomade every day now and then I just
fill it in with my normal brow powder
either the whitening lightening or
darker Brown that I have from anesthesia
as well the next product I wanted to
show you guys really quick was my
deodorant right now and this one is dove
advanced care in cool essentials and it
just smells so good it smells like
cucumber cucumber melon which is amazing
I'm really really loving it and I know
that's super random but I don't think
I've ever talked about deodorant and
I'll make this one quick but I actually
really love it and for those of you
asking how my armpits are so light this
is the Deuter and I've been using but
other than that yeah leave that at that
but this one is great keeps me smelling
fresh all day I also quickly wanted to
throw in my copper Sigma brushes because
they are amazing and as you can see
they're super dirty and they need a good
washing because I've been using them
like crazy but these brushes are amazing
they've taken over all other brushes
that I've ever used in the past and I
highly suggest that for those of you
guys who are makeup artists or you're
constantly freelancing and you're using
a bunch of brushes I definitely
recommend these they're high-quality so
you can wash them all the time and you
don't have to worry about the bristles
coming out and all that good stuff so
love these Sigma brushes and I actually
saw a lot of you guys asking how I clean
my brushes I think that was actually one
of my first videos that I ever posted on
this channel so if you want to go see a
little throwback video I have it where I
teach you how I clean my brushes super
easy I just use dish soap and olive oil
mix
and then they look brand-new so I do
that every two weeks and in between I
have like a spray that I use just to
wash them as well but these aren't so to
be honest I'm constantly changing my
face washing routine whenever I run out
of a product I usually just go pick up
whatever is new or whatever seems to be
the best I like to try a bunch of
different things that way when I find
the absolute best I can go back to it
but this month I've been using the
Garnier blackhead eliminating scrub and
I like to always buy something with the
so list sick so allistic acid and the
little beads in it so that way it can
get really deep into your pores I like
to use the Olay face brush that I had
talked to you guys about in other videos
and it gets really really deep into your
pores and it's great for unclogging
blackheads and just getting your skin to
be in the best condition it can be
because when you apply a lot of makeup
and you're not washing your face right
that's when the pimples come so really
loving this one right now it's about
halfway done I like to use a lot I do it
morning and night so definitely
recommend this for any of you guys
trying to get rid of those blackheads so
the next product and I'm gonna be
talking about is the mate' fit tee and
this cool little shaker you can put
protein and stuff in it and has like a
little netted thing in it so when you
shake it it mixes it all up but these I
think are out of stock for now I know
they're restocking I believe either this
month or next month so I will let you
guys know on that but it's funny because
Brett had found this product originally
and we had tried it out and I was loving
it but recently it's so funny because
every time I look on the popular page on
Instagram I'm seeing all these huge
Fitness people and all these amazing
people using the product saying how much
they love it so I really started making
it a routine to drink it almost every
single day the metabolic boost is my
favorite I just mix it like a tea and
then it's supposed to be really good for
your metabolism so of course I've been
working out and watching what I eat but
I also have been drinking this as well
and I got to be using this cute little
shaker as well Brett does have a 10% off
code if anyone is interested in
buying it I have seen some amazing
feedback so far so that makes me really
excited because I love when I suggest
something and then we ret suggest
something and you guys try it and it's
like your new favorite item so loving
these right now I wanted to squeeze that
one in as well so for now I think that's
going to be it for my favorites there
are a lot of things that I feel like I
have mentioned in other videos that I
didn't really want to include and make
it all just stuff you've heard before
but what I did want to do was on my blog
I'm going to be putting a lot of new
fashion favorites and favorite stores so
if you guys want to see the fashion end
of it definitely check out my blog
because I'll have all the beauty
products I listed in this video as well
as some fashion picks and some favorite
top stores right now as well as any
updated coupon codes so definitely check
out my blog for that I also really
quickly wanted to let you guys know I'm
wearing my 260 gram Lily hair extensions
I have three tracks in right now my hair
is actually getting so long as it is and
Brett still doesn't understand he's like
why do you wear your extensions your
hair is almost as long as them and men
will just never understand it just it's
nice to have some extra thickness and I
don't know I feel like even when my hair
is as long as the extensions I'll
probably still wear them just for the
thickness and I don't know once you wear
them it's just hard to go back so I am
loving them it's been a few months and I
haven't done like a legit review on them
but I really really love them I highly
recommend them and I highly recommend
the 220 grams as well those were the
only two that I have tried and loved so
for now that is going to be it for my
favorites I didn't want to talk about
stuff that I've mentioned in other
videos but if you guys want to see some
of my fashion favorites definitely go
over to my blog at the beauty Bible comm
and you'll see all the favorites in this
video as well as some others so I hope
