this tutorial is inspired by the one and
only Marilyn Monroe
she is hands down the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen her beauty is just
classic and I know millions and millions
people feel the same way I do
so I did some searching on YouTube and I
couldn't really find a tutorial that I
personally liked so I figured we just
look at a few pictures and then I
created her look so if you would like to
learn how I got this just keep watching
and I'll show you how first I'm taking
this white color for my wet and wild
fantasy palette I got this around
Halloween time so I think it is meant
for Halloween but the white color is
going to be a good base because it's
going to help bring out the white
eyeshadow when applying this you're
going to want to put this on your entire
eyelid and you're going to want to drag
it in towards the tear duct and the
inner part of your nose this is going to
open up your eye then taking my max
shader brush and the same white paint
palette I'm going to go over what I had
just done with my fingers just to make
it a little bit darker of a white that
way it's going to make your eyes pop
even more
it's important to do this on the inner
part of your eye this is going to open
it up and it's going to give it the look
that Marilyn has then taking this white
color for my ELF palette I'm going to be
applying this right over my entire
eyelid
we're also gonna want to apply whatever
is left on your brush right underneath
your brow bone just to highlight it I'm
then taking a flatter shader brush and
also my ELF palette I'm taking this
light brown color and I'm just gonna be
going over this right into the crease of
my eye you want to do this like with a
thin line you don't want to make it too
thick it's easier to do that inner part
of your eye if you're looking down so
that way you can see how you're going to
shape it just like how Marilyn has it
when you're doing the outer part of your
eye you're not going to connect it to
where you would normally put your
eyeliner like I do in every other
tutorial you're just going to drag the
line out parallel to the end of your
eyebrow
you
next taking my Bobby Brown gel liner I'm
going to line the upper part of my
eyelid
you're creating this look you're going
to want to extend the tail higher and
longer than you normally would
to achieve the dough I'd look like
Marilyn Monroe I'm just going to be
taking a pair of false lashes and
cutting them in half I'm just going to
be placing them on the outer corners of
my eye and again this isn't and give it
a more narrow doe-eyed look
after you've applied your false lashes
you can just apply our mascara I'm using
L'Oreal telescopic mascara my absolute
favorite which you probably know by now
this part of course is optional but I'm
just going to be applying a beauty mark
like how Marilyn Monroe has it right
above my lip and I'm using my Bobbi
Brown gel liner and this pointed brush
you
I'm using my Jordana cosmetics lip liner
in the color Tonti and just going to be
lining my lips before I apply the red
lipstick
you
the red lipstick I chose to use in this
video is from covergirl and I'm going to
be applying this all over my entire lips
and I'm going to be using a little bit
of a darker red after I'm done with this
then taking darkside by Mack and a
lipstick brush I'm just going to be
applying this on the outer corners of my
lips this is going to darken it a little
bit and also make your lips look bigger
so that is how I got my Marilyn Monroe
inspired makeup look I hope everyone
enjoyed it and thank you all so much for
watching stay tuned for my next video
love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
