Megan Fox I posted a video in October of
a look inspired by her and it reached a
million views this past week so I wanted

stare at it for hours for this look I'm
using all I shadow is from The Naked 2
palette by urban decay the first color
is called booty call and this is gonna
go on my entire eyelid in and also
underneath my brow neck sticking my Mac
224 blending brush and the color tease
from the same palette I'm going to be
applying this right in the crease of my
eye and blending it upwards towards the
inner part of my eyebrow this is one of
my favorite brushes because it blends
everything very nice and even and it
makes no harsh lines I'm lining my upper
lid with my Bobbi Brown gel liner my Mac
eye liner brush

cosmetics the color is called 20 and I'm
going to be using a couple different
colors on my lips

lips and then I'm then going to be

you soon I'm gonna do this is a little
bit different then I would normally do
let me get out my calculator so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna pick three numbers
from the random generator because
there's 13,000 comments which means a
thousand and 300 whatever our page is so
I'm gonna pick three numbers and then
I'm into the average of those three
numbers and that's going to be the page
number so there's 13,000 agent at 852 or
comments
so all these numbers divided together
gives you 650 so I'm going to go to the
six hundred and fiftieth page so give me
a few minutes
