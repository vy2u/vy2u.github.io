for watching in this tutorial I'll be
showing you how I got this megan fox
inspired makeup look a lot of you asked
me about an eyeliner tutorial so here
you go first i'm using a concealer and
applying this on my eyelid and this is
so the eyeshadow stays on better using
this white matte color from my ELF
palette I'm going to be applying this on
my eyelid and also underneath my brow
bone
you're then going to want to apply a
shimmery white color over I showed you
had already just put on
using my Mac blending brush and also my
ELF palette I'm going to be taking this
light beige Sparkle color and applying
it right in the crease of my eye
and then taking my Bobbi Brown gel
eyeliner as well as the liner brush and
applying this right on my eyelid you
then want to extend your line dragging
it out towards your eyebrow it's good to
do this in sections that way you make
sure that it's perfect
taking a small angled brush and a black
eyeshadow I'm then going to be lining my
lower lashline to achieve this look
you're only going to want to use this on
the outer part of your eye
you then want to apply your false lashes
or your mascara at this time I'm using
L'Oreal telescopic mascara and this is
my absolute favorite mascara it makes my
eyelashes super long you then want to
line your inner lash line with a black
eye pencil this will make your eyes
appear more narrow like Megan Fox
for my lips I use Jordana lip liner in
the color 20 and also my beauty addicts
lip gloss in a peach color
thank you everybody for watching and I
hope that this helped out a lot have a
great day guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
