Megan Fox the first step in this look is
to apply Revlon age-defying makeup all
over your entire face I'm using the Mac
dual fiber brush and this is going to
get in every little crevice of my face
following this I'm going to be using
Revlon age-defying concealer right
underneath my eyes this is going to
brighten up my eyes to prevent any dark
circles or any other flaws and blending
this and you want to Pat your brush you
don't want to smear it otherwise the
color will seep into your skin too much
and it won't actually cover anything you
want to blend the outside edges of this
with the same dual fiber brush that way
there's no sharp lines I'm using the Mac
small angled brush along with a colored
eyeshadow that matches my hair I'm going
to be filling in my eyebrows to give
them more shape like Megan Fox
next I'm going to be taking L'Oreal True
Match super blendable powder compact and
a blush brush and I'm going to be
contouring my face first I'm going to be
blending my cheekbones
then underneath my chin which I'm going
to drag down into my neck because we
don't want our next to be a different
color than our face
I'm also going to be doing the sides of
my forehead by squeezing the tip of your
brush it makes the bristles harder so
I'm going to be using this when I'm
applying the blendable powder on the
sides of my nose which is going to make
my nose appear smaller like Megan Fox
I'm going to be taking my wet n wild
Halloween paint palette and the color
white and I'm going to be placing this
all over my eyelids for this look she
has a beige color on her eyelid so this
white undertone is going to keep the
beige very very light I'm now going to
be applying a beige Mac eyeshadow all
over my entire eyelid
the next color I'm going to be using is
a reddish-brown color from Matt and I'm
also going to be using a Mac pencil
brush first I'm going to just draw a
line from the corner of my eye upwards
just so I know where I want the makeup
to end
next color I'm going to be using is by
Mac it's a reddish black mineralized
eyeshadow it's baked minerals refined
into a powder formula provide
exceptionally sheer and lightweight
application this color is going to go
right above the reddish color right into
your crease keeping this on the outer
edge of your eyes next like to be lining
the outer part of my eye with a Mac
liquid eyeliner I'll be starting this
line from the center of my eye and
dragging it outwards forming a tail this
is going to make my eyes appear longer
I'm then going to be taking that same
reddish mac color and applying it
underneath my eyelids with the same
angled brush
then I'm taking the Mack blending brush
and blending in the shadow underneath my
eyes
you never want to forget to put mascara
on your lower lashes I'm going back to
that same beige color I had used
previously and applying this to my brow
bone this color will highlight my eyes
I'm going back to the same Mac liquid
eyeliner and coloring in the outer V of
my eye
next with the blending brush I'll be
taking this black color from Mac and
applying it in the interview of my eye
this is just to accentuate my eyes again
making them appear longer if you do get
any mascara on your eyes while you're
applying your mascara don't worry you
can take the same beige eyeshadow and
just apply it right over the mascara
next I'll be applying lip liner this
color is called eggplant be careful when
you're using such a dark color because
you don't want to outline any further
than your lips actually are with that
otherwise a little pure fate
after lining your lips you're going to
fill in the rest of your lips with a
matte lipstick this is called darkside
to give the color red look to it I'm
going to be applying a red lip gloss by
Revlon over the lipstick I'm then going
to be taking a sparkly beige color and
applying it to the center of my lip and
also on the top in the middle this is
going to make my lips appear bigger
I'm also going to be applying the same
white color for my wet and wild palette
on the top of my lips and in the center
of my bottom lip
with a black eyepencil I'm going to be
applying a line inside of my eye this
effect also makes your eyes appear
longer
besides this look being inspired by
Megan Fox I also think that this look
could definitely be used for Halloween
if you're thinking of being a vampire or
something the sort that is how I got my
Megan Fox inspired look I hope this
helped Inc you for watching for dark
beige and bronze skin a deep red
lipstick like this one with a burgundy
tone is perfect for ivory and light
beige and I recommend a true red however
if you have a very fair complexion look
for a ride with a pink tint to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
