watching today I'm here with karlie
number 2 and this is Bret's cousin so
how do you like your makeup I love it
yeah I love it yes
good well I did her makeup for her Bat
Mitzvah so she already knew she was
gonna love it but she has her eighth
grade dance coming up so we wanted to do
a little trial and I decided to film it
so thank you for coming in today with me
you for doing yeah well of course so the
day I were probably gonna just do curls
down right yeah so today we're just
gonna show you the makeup look and if
you want to learn how to get it please
keep watching good easy to start off
this look I'm going to be mixing my
L'Oreal True Match along with my BB plus
and I'm applying this all over her face
with my Beauty Blender to prime her eyes
I'm going to be using my Sigma persuade
eyeshadow base
I'm going to lightly fill in her brows
so I'm using my brow Wiz and I'm just
combing them up first and then very
lightly filling them in when you're
using an eyebrow pencil like this it's
important to use a very light hand and
slow swift motions that way it's never
too dark and it's gonna look really
natural and it's just basically filling
in any holes to hold her brows in place
I'm just using my clear brow gel
moving on to eyes i'm using my mac fix+
along with my vanilla pigment also by
Mac and I'm applying this all over her
eyes she is wearing a white dress so I
knew I wanted to go with a white pearly
base and something very natural in the
crease she is only in eighth grade but
since it's basically like a prom I
wanted to do something a little bit more
than she would obviously normally do
to give it a sparkly finish I'm applying
Mac pigment and frost right over that
shadow picking up my forever nude
palette and this brown color
I'm very lightly going to be dusting
this into her crease when using a brush
like this it's important to just use a
little bit of product because it's gonna
really do all the work for you and this
is just setting it up to use this darker
color with this smaller blending brush
to give her eyes more depth
then grabbing this bronze color I'm
going to be lining her lower lashline
for mascara I'm using by L'Oreal the
telescopic as usual and she had a little
bit of mascara on when she first got
there so that's why they look a little
bit clumpy but hey you all know that I
love clumpy lashes
moving on to concealer I'm using by
Laura Mercier and sc3 right under her
eyes I'm also using this color on the
bridge of her nose and between her brows
and on her chin
to set her foundation and concealer I'm
using by Rimmel stay matte powder then
I'm just adding a little bit more of the
vanilla pigmen right into her tear duct
and that's just going to highlight her
eyes a little bit
moving on to blush I'm using this one by
urban decay and I'm just applying this
right on her cheeks here I'm just adding
a little bit of bronzer just to contour
her face a little bit and I'm just
applying it on her cheekbones on her
neck around her forehead and also on her
chin grabbing a little bit of that
highlighter from that same palette I'm
just going to be highlighting right
above her blush and it's just going to
give it a really nice subtle highlight
and then for lipstick I'm using this new
pink 1 by NYX and over that I'm picking
up my whitening lightening gloss in nude
so you could see it I love it yeah am I
gonna love it it's so pretty I love it
all right so thank you guys for watching
until next time see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
