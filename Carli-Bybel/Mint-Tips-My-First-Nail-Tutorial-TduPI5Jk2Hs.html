fear and your baby
hi everyone thank you for watching so I
know a lot of you have been requesting
some sort of nail tutorial for a while
now and about a month ago I posted a
pictorial on my blog showing
step-by-step how I did it and I know a
lot of you guys like that and I'm sorry
I haven't gotten another one up but I
decided to do a tutorial showing you
step-by-step how I just did my nails and
they have like mint tips and it has the
little flower on them so again I just
wanted to let you guys know obviously
I'm not a nail artist I don't I never
went to school for nail art and I don't
have a license I don't work anywhere to
do nails so for me doing my nails is a
very relaxing time I usually take a
really long time to do them like two
hours sometimes even ask Brett he sits
there and he's like what the heck is
this girl doing but while he's watching
his football his basketball I sit there
and I do my nails and for me it's really
relaxing and it's peaceful and I don't
know I kind of go into my own world and
I don't know it's fun challenging myself
so just a quick heads up I am NOT the
neatest person ever and I am not the
best it's just more I just enjoy doing
it and it's fun for me so please don't
tell me oh my god it looks so sloppy
because I know it's not perfect it's
nowhere near perfect and one thing also
that I've always dealt with my whole
life no matter what I do is I am very
like dry cuticles and they always like
are a little bit red so I don't know we
could really see them but probably can
so if it's zoomed in and my nails look a
little red or anything like that it's
just something that my nails are always
like I use cuticle oil every single
night and I use a ridiculous amount of
lotion like every single time I wash my
hands I like slabber ons and lotion and
my hands are still dry so I apologize
for that and I apologize if there is any
mistakes or if it's a little sloppy for
you but it's just the idea and I wanted
to show you guys I guess a little bit of
a closer look into how I do my own nails
so
I hope you guys enjoy and also for those
who are asking I do have acrylic over my
nails I used to just have the gel over
them but I found it with the acrylic it
just last better so for me that's what I
like if you have long healthy nails
normally and you want to shape them like
this I recommend doing that as well but
for the acrylic it helps keep the nail
polish on a little longer so I hope you
guys enjoy and I'll see you guys soon
once I think my nail polish off the nail
polish remover that are using is the
ones that come in these little jars
because all you do is you put your
finger in and you swirl it around and
it's so easy it just takes all of your
nail polish off so these you can get
really of any drugstore I got this at
Walgreens and one thing I always do
because I have very dry cuticles and
they're always like a little red I guess
you can kind of tell right now no matter
what I do they're always like that but
one thing I'll always put on is cuticle
oil this one is by Sally Hansen and I
just put that on right around my
cuticles and the reason I do that is
because once I put my whole thing or in
the nail polish remover it does dry out
my skin so I'm just rubbing this in
around my cuticles and around my nails
as I said before I do have the acrylic
on my nails so one thing I always do is
I'll go to either the mall or wherever I
get my nails done and I will have them
fill in the acrylic and usually I have
to come home and reshape them myself
because I do like them kind of pointy
but more like a round look like this so
I always enjoy doing them myself so the
first thing that I'm going to do is I'm
gonna use a little bit of my towel and
just make sure that the oil is not on my
nails at all for this look I am using
the color minted by Revlon and this one
you can also get an end rock store or
Target and I am going to be doing what I
did to this hand which is the tips mint
and then I'm just leaving this middle
one mint and then I might add either
like a bow or a flower I haven't decided
yet but the reason I did this hand first
is because I always do one hand at a
time and the reason I do that is because
if you're doing every single hand it's
gonna be really really hard to not smear
one hand while you're doing the other
hand so I do one full hand let it
completely dry and then I go on to the
next one so first thing I'm gonna do is
put my middle nail because that's the
one I'm going to be leaving or green
and for the tips because I want them
like that it's going to be a little bit
harder right the first way I did it
didn't work too well so I'm just gonna
use the same brush that comes with the
nail polish and you're just gonna hold
it on on diagonal and draw a straight
line from here
all the way up
one thing I'll keep handy with me the
entire time this is again another reason
I didn't want to do nail tutorials cuz I
am a big mess but I keep just a little
brush this one is for nails you can buy
any kind of brush for it and I dip it
into the nail polish remover and then if
I do mess up and just brush it right
away
the key to this is doing it very slow
because if you get it too thick it is
hard to remove
now we're just going to repeat and go
over it and make it a little darker
I'm gonna go back to this brush and just
clean the sides
so one thing you can do if you don't
have a dryer at home is use your blow
dryer so I'm just gonna use my blow
dryer on the coolest setting and dry my
nails a little bit next I'm gonna add a
little flour onto my middle finger and
these I got on Amazon there may be two
to three dollars for a whole bag each
failed at different colors and they're
awesome so I'm gonna show you how to put
these on because I know a lot of people
are asking how I get them to stick so
the nail glue I'm going to be using is
this one I honestly don't remember if
this came with nail set or white but I
usually use this brush on one but I
think I glued it shut because I can't
open it so okay I'm just gonna be using
this one and first I'm gonna be putting
a little dot wherever I want on my nail
and this one's gonna be my middle finger
so I'm just gonna put the big dot I
guess you don't want to put too much so
and you're also gonna put a little dot
on the back of the rose and hold it down
wherever you want it so in this case I
want it right at the bottom so you're
just gonna hold it in place
as you're holding it down you will feel
it like moving a little bit and you just
want to try and keep it in the same spot
and there you go
it sticks I'm gonna repeat the same
thing on the other side this time I
probably won't use as much glue I don't
realize how much comes out so quickly so
a little dot on there a little dot on
the back of the rose also you can just
put your nail upside down wherever the
glue is and put it on that way and again
you're just gonna find exactly where you
want it and then hold it down
and now the final step is to just add a
topcoat I'm using diamond flash fast
drying top coat and it's by Sally Hansen
and I'm just going to be playing it on
all my nails of course you want to add
rhinestones or if you don't want to do
the flower you that part is optional
so that is the finished result I hope
you guys like them and I'm sorry they're
not the neatest I know a lot of you have
been asking how I do them so if you guys
want to see more tutorials like this let
me know I was again hesitant to do this
because I am NOT a nail master like some
of the other girls on here but I do get
creative with it sometimes and I do have
a lot of fun doing it so I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
