part maybe in magazines but she'll still
be him stars because in dark you will
see shiny cars that's when you meet
their baby well with shoes hi everyone
thank you for watching
so today's look is inspired by the one
and only Miranda Kerr she is absolutely
beautiful and I saw a couple pictures of
her that I wanted to recreate she is a
Victoria's Secret model so a lot of her
pictures are on the beach and in bikinis
and just glowing from head to toe so the
look that I went with today was a more
natural face with a glowy dewy finish
and some beachy waves that are super
easy to get and they take about half the
time as normal beachy waves and I love
this look because it is nice and full
its textured looking and again it just
gives you that nice natural look it's
not anything too dramatic for this look
I did use three different foci products
and I wanted to just show you really
quick I use the sheer hold hairspray the
full-blown mousse and the gloss and
cream and I also want to announce that
there is a giveaway if anyone is
interested in winning a supply of these
amazing products you can check out my
description box below and I have all the
information on how you can enter so if
you guys want to learn how to get this
Miranda Kerr hair and makeup look please
keep watching and I'll show you how for
this beachy look I'm going to be mixing
my foundation with this Mac illuminator
and it's just gonna give it a nice glowy
look to it so I'm gonna just pour a
little bit of the foundation on my hand
and then put a couple drops as well
and to apply and I'm just going to be
using this Mac brush I'm going to be
applying this foundation all over the
outer part of my face and the highlight
I'm going to be using my map light boost
that I usually use in most of my videos
you want to make sure you blend the
foundation down into your neck because
the one thing you definitely do not want
especially if you're trying to look like
the beautiful Miranda Kerr is a dark
line with this coloring from your neck
to your face so you can just drag it
down next I'm gonna be taking my light
boost and I'm gonna be putting this all
under my eyes and this is gonna give me
a nice highlight and one thing about
Miranda that when people always know is
her skin always looks flawless but it's
always very natural it's never cakey so
by using this it's gonna give it a nice
highlight without having to cake on
concealer later on
so again the Miranda look that I'm going
for is very napped it's so funny because
there's been so many times where I've
loved the celebrity's makeup and just
it's really easy to get inspiration from
celebrities you look at a picture and
yeah maybe you don't know exactly what
they were using but it's not too hard to
kind of match up certain colors just to
get the similar look so as an eyeshadow
base I'm just gonna be using my
concealer you can use an actual
eyeshadow base I always just use
concealer because it works just as good
and just always work the best for me so
right over that I'm going to be taking a
clean buy map this pretty brown shimmery
color
highlight I'm going to be using the
color tattoo by Maybelline and this one
is called barely bras in this I'm just
needed putting right in my tear duct
if you get your brush a little bit wet I
recommend using either fix+ you can even
use eye drops if you just get a little
bit on your brush and then dip it in the
pigment it's gonna come out a lot
brighter
this part is optional I notice Miranda
Kerr doesn't usually wear eyeliner and a
lot of the pictures that I have found of
her but since she does have smaller eyes
I want to make mine up here a little bit
smaller so I'm gonna be applying a brown
eyeliner and it is a gel eyeliner it's
called bronze by L'Oreal and it's not
too dark but it's just gonna give me a
little bit of a shadow which is gonna
make my eyes maybe appear a little bit
smaller like Miranda's
so next I'm gonna be taking this brown
bronze color and we're just gonna be
adding a little bit of a brown right
into the crease and they're gonna be
dragging a little bit out towards the
brow
I always like to use my smaller blending
brush first to get the color in the
right spot and then I always go to my
bigger one to just blend it out nicely
that way there's no sharp lines and it
does lighten it a bit doesn't keep it
very harsh and the final step for eyes
is gonna be mascara I have a in depth
mascara routine so if you want to see
how I got crazy long lashes I'm gonna
link that video right above so you can
go check that out for bronzer i'm gonna
be using True Match and we're just gonna
be applying this on my cheekbones and
around my face
one thing I've also noticed about
Miranda is she never wears too much
bronzer is usually a more blush
super pink but the reason I'm gonna
leave it like this for now is because
I'm gonna add a little bit of concealer
and once I do that I'm gonna blend it in
with the blush so it looks really
smoothly blended for concealer I'm using
by Laura Mercier the SC three and I'm
just gonna apply a little bit right
underneath my eyes and a little bit on
my nose and on my chin just to again
highlight I'm going back to my original
brush and I'm just gonna be blending it
in nicely again very light on the brush
the final step of this makeup look is
going to be lips I'm just using a nude
colored lip liner and I'm going to be
using a light pink gloss and lipstick to
get the correct lipstick I'm gonna be
mixing covergirl enchantress with NYX
orange soda
so this is the final makeup look now
let's move on to hair before creating
this look I didn't blow join my hair
straight if you guys want to learn how I
fully blow-dry my hair straight I did
recently just post a video so I will
link that right here so you can go check
that out
the only difference from my previous
video is for this look since I do want a
more textured look I used a mousse
before I blow dried I use the one by
Fekkai and it's full blown volume is
what it's called and I applied this
right in the root to my hair and I just
kind of massaged it and by doing this
before you blow dry especially on the
upper part it's gonna give you a lot
more body so I'm sure you can already
tell like my hair looks a lot bigger
than it did when I just blew dry it
straight and for this look I also did
apply my 22 inch extension so what we're
gonna do is part her hair how normally
would I'm just gonna drag my finger all
the way down to the back and pull it all
my hair to the front we're not gonna do
this hair in sections because the goal
for this is a nice messy beachy look so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna be
taking a one-inch straightener and we're
gonna be taking small pieces at a time
and forming waves so what we're gonna do
is we're going to take a small piece of
hair I'm gonna start at the front of my
hair and if you have curly hair and it's
getting curly by the roots like me you
can just kind of straighten it out just
so it's nice and silky straight and
we're gonna start about 1 inch down from
our hair and we're gonna take the iron
and spin it around once like this and
once you get with about one inch left to
your hair you're just gonna let go and
it's gonna give you this like weird ish
looking wave like that
another please
so again start about one inch down spin
the iron go slow and when there's about
I'm gonna say a half inch left you're
gonna let go and you're going to repeat
all throughout your hair
it's a pending on how well your hair
holds a curl you can stop in between I
usually do about a couple pieces and
then I will use Suffolk I sheer hold
hairspray I love this one because it
gives it that sticky ish look but it's
not sticky it's very flexible and you
can brush through it so it's not gonna
be like gross but it gives you a more
textured look so as I do a couple pieces
since my hair pretty much holds a curl
I'm only gonna spray a little bit on the
pieces that I just done and again every
like five six pieces you can just
respray it
this is what its gonna look like after
it's gonna give it a nice messy but like
lady beachy look and I absolutely love
this because not only does it take half
the amount of time it gives it a very
natural look so I mean some people are
lucky and have kind of messy wavy hair
like this that dries like this but
unfortunately for me I don't so now
let's do the other side and one thing to
remember while doing this look is you
don't need to take even sections you can
do little pieces you can take them from
wherever and do the same technique and
it's gonna give you that nice beachy
look
I'm gonna take a little bit more of my
foci glossing cream and I'm just gonna
apply about this much through the ends
just to smooth it in a little bit so now
we have some nice messy beachy waves I
hope you guys learned something new if
you have not tried this technique yet
with the straightener I definitely
recommend it to get this look there are
three main ingredients that I use and
that would be the foci sheer whole hair
spray the glossing cream and I use the
mousse which is full-blown volume which
I use before I blow dried remember if
you guys are interested in entering the
giveaway I have all information below in
the description box I hope you guys
enjoyed this Miranda Kerr inspired
beachy glamorous look of course I don't
recommend it if you are going to the
beach it is just to get that nice summer
glow and the nice beachy hair if you
want to go out or anything like that so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
until next time I'll see you guys later
always be your friend cooking on a stick
it out to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
