vlogging people get in the car and we
neither looking promotor scare all this
crazy already picked off all my mascara
from earlier I have now been on hold for
an hour and four minutes the Sleep
Number so we drove up to our new place
around I think like 11
we're now at Home Depot I was supposed
to go in we had some things to return
and we needed more boxes but um I'm
still on hold since we left the house so
we had our mattress delivered and it was
the wrong one I guess I went into the
store and I went and I ordered it online
it didn't actually order with the guy in
the store and I think I ordered like one
thing wrong of course about it so I'm
now at home trying to get the right one
delivered it is Monday at 2:30 I also
called the moving company today we
originally wanted to wait till after
Christmas to do the big move so we
weren't stressed over the weekend but we
called and they didn't have anything
available for Monday and Nicole and
Jeremy come on Tuesday so we are going
to do the move on Wednesday which is in
two days which means I have a lot to do
today and tomorrow
um we did bring a lot of boxes over but
I still have a lot to do so gonna be
very tight I feel like when they make
you hold this long it just mean I just
want to return the bed now like I'm
calling for an exchange I don't know why
when the guys delivered the mattress
they're like you're not gonna like this
bed you guys are you guys like cuddling
at night you're gonna fall right through
the middle so I called but when we were
walking out
now we're in 19 minutes oh yeah oh yeah
what do I do
pick my eyelashes so hour and 48 minutes
and I told them to just call me back
when I was taking care of because
sitting on the phone that long is just
unacceptable Brett is now in bagel talk
getting us some bagels and then we're
gonna go home eat those bagels and then
I'm gonna pack good morning guys it is
10:30 we are on our way up and you have
some more boxes I don't remember where I
left off yesterday but when we went home
we just packed the rest of our room up
move up a little bit more to do today
but we're going to meet the lady where
we bought our couch they do a free like
they come in for free and they measure
and just make sure you're ordering the
right size and blah blah blah so she's
coming up at 11:00 so we were on our way
up there now my tile in my Beauty room
is all finished today so I'm so excited
to go see how it looks
I'm excited to show you guys because you
saw the before so you knew what it looks
like with the carpet but
morning guys don't mind the do um I
accidentally left my camera on my car
last night
so see what we got accomplished pack and
then I have racks which I put my old
curtains over the moving truck is gonna
be here and about the time is it
probably like 45 minutes so I'm just
getting ready and I was doing my lips
and I wanted to just oh don't mind these
curtains these were the curtains that
were here originally okay so were lip
liner all over and then I fill him in a
little bit what was I wearing yesterday
in my lips I was wearing dose of colors
stone she want to wear again today it's
just I packed everything else it's so
funny because I lost my L'Oreal
telescopic and it was my last one so I
have a bunch of extra mascara that I
have gotten sense me that I haven't
tried so I've been using the Lancome I
don't know which one this is
Grenn something I actually really like
Kate we are right
so yesterday I was planning on vlogging
while I was packing um but I got home
and I felt this overwhelming stress take
over me I just kind of I came upstairs I
sat down in this exact chair I looked
myself in there and I'm like I have a
lot to do like a lot like way too much
so I procrastinated for like two hours I
did all the laundry they were so much
fun and I want to make sure everything
we brought over was clean so I did some
laundry and then I kind of just sat here
not knowing even where to start and then
I went and I got a coffee for like a
little pick-me-up it was also some more
time to stall and then when I came home
I went nuts and I literally did
everything and only room that's not done
is my closet I did some of the drawers
and I took some of the stuff off and I
also took all of my pants out but um
they're not going to come smooth this
closet probably for at least a couple
more weeks so there's no brush we have
this place that we're in now until March
1st actually because that's when our
lease is up so after a little bit of
time I was like you know what chill out
relax it's everything does not need to
be done today thank goodness because it
would have been bad but um yeah so I
have my rack of clothing right here I
want to bring down my two dressers and
then that's basically it they're coming
to do all the big stuff like our bed and
our couches and stuff like that and
don't mind this is the first day that
I'm wearing short sleeves I've been
wearing turtlenecks every single day
there was a reason behind it you could
see my face is one color and then my
arms are another color
um Cube right so yes I am aware but um I
would normally be getting either like a
spray tan or something but my eczema has
been really bad the past couple weeks so
the last thing that I want to do is put
any self-tanner on my skin and make it
worse we have to uni be I'll deal with
this 20 minutes they'll be there in 20
minutes
morning guys I haven't blogged since the
move because it was quite a crazy day I
will fill you guys all in but I'm
currently in the extra bedroom upstairs
this is where I put everything so
everything else see me but today I'm
going out with my mom she had a lot done
so I think I'd finish out the vlog with
today and explain to you guys what has
been going on I hope everyone had a
Merry Christmas and yeah I'm gonna just
do my makeup right now and then oh look
who came to join me
crazy cats can you see how this pink
color and my Carli bybel palette just
one I literally use every single day to
highlight my nose and my eyes because
for some reason it's just the most
pigmented shadow that I have it I'm not
even just saying that ah Cindy yeah she
jumped onto my palette and like put her
paws on it
she definitely is makeup on her neck hey
one of cute for blush I'm using new
romance foundation today I used my
Chanel in number 30 concealer is the
makeup forever
the new Ultra HD concealer it's
literally my favorite so I showered last
night and I just put my hair in a braid
and then it's basically dry right now
and this is how I've been doing my hair
like every day and that's I feel like
why it's grown so long um I barely ever
use heat on it anymore since I got the
keratin shower raid wake up take it out
my hair's done I literally can't handle
it there's three dinosaurs this entire
time
this was their kids room obviously so
you guys got to see the before and now
here is the after with the gray wood
they're coming to do like the molding
around their to get rid of that like
space they got to just top it off but um
as I told you there's like a dust on it
so you could kind of see the idea of it
but we still gotta clean it and then I
moved all of my dressers in here but
there's still tape and everything on
them because they have to finish again
the molding along the wall so I didn't
set them up how I wanted to I just had
the movers just throw them in here but
eventually I think I'm going to have
these three push it up against there and
then I think right
I'll be able to fit that so I'll have
all the drawers on one side and then
this piece I want to put against that
back wall the only downside so far of
having tile is my cushion do it's all in
my hand and it cracked but you can see
it was easy to clean up there's no mess
at all so this is my beauty room um
they're coming at 7:30 tomorrow morning
to finish it today and tomorrow we just
have a lot of running around to do my
mom said it can help me today they've a
lot to do before Nicole and Jeremy get
here so we wanted to make sure that they
feel nice and comfortable I got to get
them a comforter I ordered one from
Target and I didn't love it when it came
in so I'm gonna go look for that today
and I have literally my list is about
this long stuff that I need so look at
this mascara right it's pretty good for
not being L'Oreal telescopic I'm
actually very impressed wait so this is
the cat tree that Brett built we got
this a few weeks ago for the kitties and
there's nothing it so far hi babe doing
football
Oh
so I could scrunch it a little more
so like I said earlier I haven't filmed
since moving day
I just want to fill you guys in on to
what actually happened that day it was
one of the most restful days ever so I
feel like the day you moved is
guaranteed to be stressful no matter
what so that was inevitable but we had
the entire band packed up
we had our car packed up and I put the
kitties in their little kitty carrier we
were just getting ready to leave I put
them in the car the front seat I had the
car running and I had the blessing cuz
it was cold
I shut the door I went in to go lock up
and make sure we had everything Brett
was putting shoes on inside the moving
truck for Stiller and driveway getting
ready to leave and when we went back out
to get in the car to leave the doors
were locked so the car that we have has
a little fob and the whole point of
having those fobs is that the keys can't
lock itself in the car so both sets of
keys were in the car don't tell me how
the door locked because I thought that
was literally not possible so I'm trying
to open the door I'm trying to open the
trunk and I realized that there was
literally no way of getting in the car
and I had a nervous breakdown because
the babies were in the car if the babies
weren't in the car I probably won't have
been freaking out as much but the moving
trucks pulling out of our development
we're paying them hourly
and now we're locked out of our car I
was literally freaking out because we
had to go we had to meet them at the new
house so they can unload it so we told
them to go grab something to eat while
we try to figure it out I called up the
place that we got it from and they were
telling me that I had a somehow climbing
a ride all the way to that which was a
half hour away and get a key made so I
tried calling the person that we got the
car promising if he would come meet us I
would pay him to come drop it off to us
because we only have one car so there
was no way of us getting down there to
go get the new key and after about a
half hour speaking to everybody in this
place no one could help me they didn't
know what to do the guy would like her
at all pulling back after about another
15 minutes meanwhile this is all within
like 40 minutes of time so within
another 15 minutes I get a phone call
back and the guy goes do you have the
UConnect app and I'm like yeah it's an
app that I'd that won it because the
sales guy told us to download it I never
had opened it I didn't know what it did
when I did set up an account probably
like right after I got the car so I
guess I do have the app blame me I
wasn't like yes I was and they told me
that you can actually unlock your door
from the app so I hung up with him I
logged off the app and little did I know
that I can unlock the door from my app
from my phone have you ever heard of
something like to do that so I never
even knew that that was possible but
thank the Lord because I don't even know
what
I've done I was debating whether to
smash up in the window just we can get
in so it was about 45 minutes of time
that we had not getting into the car and
I was freaking out because I had the
heat blasting because the car was cold
and I didn't want them to be cold and
this point they were probably like holy
crap this is too much heat so I didn't
vlog at all the rest of that day because
I just couldn't handle life but yeah
that was on Wednesday and then Thursday
we had Christmas Eve we went over to
Brett's and June's house and she's just
the sweetest woman ever Friday morning
on Christmas we went to Brett's mom's
for breakfast and for presents and then
we went to my mom's and I'm sure a guy
that he called me on snapchat saw how
cute all the little kitties were my mom
has two kitties and then I brought Cindy
and bear over so they can all have a
little playdate and it was honestly the
most precious thing ever like it was so
cool getting to see all that so that was
our Christmas was very relaxing and then
Saturday yesterday what did we do it
I've been flogged again Oh
Brett's brother Jared and cousin Carly
came over to see the house and then he
went and got coffee we went out for a
little bit and then me and Brett went
and did some errands we went to Home
Depot with the target um yeah I think
that's really all we did so today I'm
going out with my mom and yeah that is
basically analytically vibin on why I
haven't filmed but that would happen to
us literally I've never heard of someone
locking their fob in a car or locking up
keyless entry in their own car because
it's not possible go think yeah
so this is our couch from our first
place together we had it clean so we can
use it until our other couch comes this
is the fabric of the couch that we chose
it's like the color of my jacket so it's
gonna be a grey and that is coming in
