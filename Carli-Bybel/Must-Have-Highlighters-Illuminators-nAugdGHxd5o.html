cuz I'm still
like you hi everybody thank you for
watching in today's video I'm going to
be talking about
a bunch of different highlighters slash
illuminators whatever you want to call
them I have a full draw of a bunch of
different ones that I bought throughout
the past few months and I wanted to go
through some of the ones that I love and
some of the ones that I wish I could
return because they were not worth the
money so I'm going to go through them
with drugstore options and higher-end
options and then I'm going to tell you
my absolute favorites out of all of them
so if you want to see what they are
please keep watching so the first set of
illuminator slash highlighters I'm going
to be talking about are from your
drugstore or from Amazon so they are
very affordable the first ones that I
want to talk about are the Revlon skin
lights these are probably the first ones
that I went out and tried as far as
illuminators I like these because they
are a liquid consistency
I think the peach light and the bear
light are my favorite out of the four
and the collection but I think these
ones are definitely worth your money if
you guys want to try a nice subtle glow
I will be doing swatches of every single
thing as well throughout the video so if
you want to see how it looks on the skin
just stay tuned and I will be showing
those as well but I definitely highly
recommend these if you guys are looking
for a really cheap drugstore option the
next illuminator I'm going to be talking
about is by NYX and this one is called
born to glow liquid loominator and I
actually just picked this one up not too
long ago but it is really really pretty
I would compare this to the Revlon ones
because it's the same idea you want to
just very lightly tap it onto your skin
afterwards you can also mix these with
your foundation but I have a few other
options that I find are a better
consistency to mix with your foundation
so this one is really great as well it
gives you a more pink brightening tone
to it
another drugstore favorite of mine is
the L'Oreal magic Lumi and this is the
one that I like to mix in with my
foundation if I were doing a full
drugstore look this I've had for about a
year now and I love the consistency of
it this is just going to give you a very
subtle highlight but again I like to mix
this one in with my foundation and I
have three others that I'm going to
mention that really weren't my favorites
and then I'm going to show you the
swatches of all of them I recently
of this highlighter from Hartman's and
it's by Physicians Formula and I was
excited about it because it does look
like a really pretty shimmery
illuminator but it is not pigmented
whatsoever so I was so disappointed in
this and I already ripped open the
packaging so I'm not sure if I could
have even returned it but probably won't
be using this so again I was a little
disappointed I wouldn't waste your money
if you're looking for a really nice
illuminator the next product that I'm
not too fond of is the covergirl
trumagic luminizer and these come in
three colors as well and I did pick them
all up just to try them out and
unfortunately this one is more of just
like a sparkly finish it doesn't give it
the pretty glow that I wanted so as far
as these I'm not a big fan of I mean
everyone of course has their preference
I will show you guys the swatches of
each so you can see if maybe this is
something that you were looking for then
it maybe is best for you but the other
day I was recently in Walgreens and they
have these in minier versions so I guess
if maybe you want to try it out but you
don't want to buy the whole thing try
out the mini version but this one again
wasn't really one of my favorites to
other illuminators that I actually
really loved as well from the drugstore
are by Maybelline they're called the
Dream Lumi and these I actually like to
use underneath my concealer umm if you
guys saw my original highlighting
contour routine I showed you guys this
as a cheaper option to my Mac prep and
prime highlighter and when I use these
what I like to do is apply my foundation
all over the outer part of my face and
then instead of applying a darker
foundation under my eyes where I want to
highlight I will apply this underneath
and the colors that I have are radiant
and ivory
so moving on to non drugstore
illuminators / highlighters the first
one I want to talk about is the BB Plus
illumination this one is by Gerard
cosmetics and I believe I mentioned this
in my last favorites video this one is
amazing it is a BB cream so you can use
it alone but what I like to do with this
is I like to put a pump of my foundation
and then a pump of this this one is the
only one that I didn't purchase with my
own money but just because I have a
coupon code for it and I didn't purchase
it doesn't mean that I'm just going to
mention a product that I don't really
love this one I've loved for the past
few months and I back it up a hundred
percent a really similar BB cream is the
Tarte BB cream Amazonian clay BB
illuminating moisturizer and this one I
found at Sephora and I actually really
really love this I like to just use this
one alone it's not too shiny so you can
use it as just a BB cream I like this
when I'm doing a really natural look or
if I just want to apply something on my
face just even out my skin tone this one
is amazing it was sold out in the store
so I had it buy it online which I guess
goes to show that it is a really great
product so I definitely recommend this
one as well third illuminating BB cream
that I tried out was by Stila
and this one unfortunately I wasn't a
fan of I always find myself grabbing the
other two over this one it doesn't
really give you that much of an
illumination type of look
illumination take a look but you get
what I'm saying so the other ones are
gonna give you a really pretty glow
finish and this one is a little bit dull
so yeah not a big fan of this one and
it's pretty pricey so the next product
I've had for quite some time as well
this one is the Mac strobe cream and
this is just a lotion that has an
illuminating look to it so I like to
sometimes apply this underneath as a
primer so it's going to give your face a
really shiny look this one is great when
I first got it I was using it a lot I
did stop using it as much but if I ever
want like a nice glow I'll usually apply
extra of this underneath right
underneath my concealer to give it a
nice glow but this one is great do I
hundred percent recommend it maybe not
there's a few others that I like the
best
but again I'm going to show you guys all
the swatches once I mention all the
products so you guys can really
see what product would be best for
whatever you're looking for the next
product is by Stella as well and this
one is called all-over shimmer and this
one I actually really love since it has
that nude shimmery look to it it's a
perfect one to mix with your foundation
and again this is going to give you that
all-over beautiful highlight I know most
of the ones that I'm mentioning I'm
saying positive things about and that's
just because depending on what look
you're going for these are really great
options I have a couple in my draw that
I'm not even gonna mention because they
were waste of money so whatever products
that I do mention that I absolutely love
they are the ones that I use the most
tried way too many products so I feel
like I have a decent argument against
what is good and what isn't and again
this is just my opinion on what I've
loved and what I've used okay so now
moving onto powder highlighters
originally when I first started trying
out different highlighters and different
illuminators I immediately went to the
liquid version of it and that's just
because I figured you just dab a little
bit on your finger and then you can dab
it on your face and it's gonna give you
the best look but it wasn't until I
actually made a trip into Sephora that I
tried out a few powdered illuminators
and I think these ones are great these
ones are a lighter color they're more
like a white shimmery option but I like
to use my tapered blending brush by
Sigma dip it in there and then very
lightly brush it on like right here and
right underneath your eye and it gives
you a beautiful beautiful highlight this
one is my absolute favorite out of the
powder options this one is called
two-faced candlelight glow and it has a
double side here but the side that I
love the best is the white side it is
definitely a really really glowy
pigmented option and the other one that
I also picked up that same day is by
Sephora brand and this one is called
light beam and this is going to give you
a very very similar pretty glow I would
have to say the Too Faced one is a
little bit more of my favorite but these
two are great because you can use them
as eyeshadows or to highlight your
Cupid's bow to highlight your tear dog
highlight under your brows so you can
get a lot of different uses out of the
powder highlighter so that is why I
think if maybe you want something that
can do more than one thing definitely
spend a little bit more and try these
two because out of the powdered ones
that I've tried from the drugstore they
really were not pigmented at all and
I don't know I feel like if you're going
to spend a little bit extra money it is
worth it in some cases so in a few of my
recent videos I've used the Estee Lauder
heat wave highlighter this one was a
limited edition so it's really no longer
on stock and this illuminator is amazing
but it was a limited edition so there
really are no more on the market and the
ones that are on Amazon are like triple
the price that it actually was I see a
lot of the girls using this and it is a
gorgeous gorgeous highlight I actually
found an exact duplicate of it and that
is the one by Kiko that I used in my
most recent video for prom and it's
going to give you the same color but
this one is 10 to 15 dollars and this
one is going for like $100 the Kiko
cosmetics doesn't ship in the u.s.
Garden State Plaza Mall New Jersey
actually just opened the first store in
the US and it was so crazy because I was
looking at their online store and it
only ships to the UK and after I had a
cart full of things I realized I'd only
shipped to the UK and I was like oh my
god this is just such a horrible moment
like what am I going to do I really need
to try this stuff me and Brett already
had plans I'm going to Garden State
Plaza just for the day to spend the day
and this was the following day so I
typed in store locators for Kiko
cosmetics and it said that this new one
just opened a few weeks back and Garden
State Plaza and I was like obviously it
was meant to be so I went and I picked
it up and I was right it is an exact
duplicate so for any of you guys in the
u.s. I'm sorry you can't really order it
as of right now but if you are in the
New Jersey area Garden State Plaza Mall
has the only store in America so amazing
amazing option and I love it it is
actually marketed as an eyeshadow but
you can use it as illuminator as well
so I think I mentioned about 15
different options that I've personally
loved there was a few that I threw in
there that I would absolutely not
recommend buying whatsoever but again I
do have other Eliminator products that
I've used but I tend to not really grab
for them so I didn't want to even
mention them in the video but the ones
that I told you guys about that I love
do have my stamp of approval so for
anyone on the market for an illuminator
or highlighter I hope this video helped
I wanted to do something a little
different and since I've had this
highlighter obsession the past few
months I figured let me just share some
of the knowledge that I've learned from
trying a bunch of products so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I hope it wasn't
too long and don't forget to check out
my blog because I'll be posting pictures
of all the swatches as well as links to
all the ones that you can find online I
love you guys so much and until next
time I'll see you guys later
when I'm walking down the street on set
makes me wanna run shadows of you I
still change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
