sorry again that it has been a little
bit since I posted a lot has been going
on the past let's say like three four
weeks um I know the last video I posted
I had let you guys know what was the
update and what was really holding me
back from filming and unfortunately two
days before my birthday which was
October 15th my Papa passed away and it
was really really hard on all of us so
it was really important for all of us to
be together and just kind of relax and
spend time with each other and not worry
about work so that's really what's been
going on the past couple of weeks I
originally planned some fun things to do
for my birthday weekend since it was the
big 25 but all of that kind of got
postponed probably at least another week
or two until everything kind of settles
down a little bit but on my actual
birthday which was Saturday the 17th I
did go out to dinner an early dinner we
did have the funeral super early on
Sunday so we didn't do anything crazy
just had a dinner and then hung out a
little bit after but I did decide to put
some makeup on get dressed and just try
to celebrate a little bit so that is
what we did I did post a picture and a
lot of you guys have requested the
makeup look that I did so I wanted to
film that one for you guys I do plan on
going out to celebrate my birthday at a
later date and if you guys want to see
that look I can always do that look as
well so I also have not done any
Halloween looks to be honest that is the
last thing that's been on my mind but I
will try and get at least one or two up
this week for you guys that way if you
need any last-minute ideas you can do
that but luckily so many people have
done such amazing looks this year I've
seen a lot on Instagram
music just started out of nowhere papa
before again to today's look I just
wanted to thank every single person who
sent me well wishes and who we're
praying for my papa and everything it
really meant the absolute world to me as
hard as it all was it was so nice and
encouraging to see all of your words
anytime I would open up any of my social
media accounts so honestly thank you
guys I don't know if I thanked you
enough and if I do I apologize but
seriously you guys are everything to me
and you always know how to make me smile
so I love you guys so much I am so
excited to finally be back filming for
you guys and if you want to see how I
got my birthday look for this year
please keep watching to start off this
look I am applying the Milani shadow
eyes and this dark brown shade right on
my eyelid with my eye shadow brush I am
blending all of this in this is just to
give the entire look a darker base it
will be easier to build and it will stay
on a lot longer
with a pencil brush and my Carli bybel
palette I'm picking up this dark brown
shade and I'm applying that right where
I would apply my eyeliner for this look
I'm kind of doing it opposite I'm doing
the darker parts lower towards my eyelid
and then I'm going to blend it up so it
gets lighter as it goes up for eyeliner
I'm using the Kat Von D tattoo liner
taking that same shade with my pencil
brush I'm just going to darken right
above where I did the eyeliner next with
a large blending brush I'm picking up
this Anastasia shadow in the color fawn
and I'm applying this right into the
crease of my eye
once I'm done blending I'm going to be
taking a little bit of that same shade
with a smaller brush and I'm just gonna
be blending it onto the top of my eyelid
then grabbing this brown shimmer color
I'm applying that right above the dark
brown color and I'm applying it right
below the color fawn
I'm just using whatever's left on my
brush I didn't dip it into another color
and I'm just blending it all in so it
gives it a really pretty gradient look
one thing I've been doing lately is
realigning my eyeliner after I apply my
lashes I've noticed obviously it can
lighten so if you apply the Kat Von D as
a base and then the gel over it it's
just going to keep it super dark and
it's going to make it last a lot longer
picking up this light pink shimmer color
I'm applying this right underneath my
eyebrow also in my tear duct
with my pencil brush in the same dark
brown color I'm applying this right on
my lower lash line
you
with a black kohl liner I'm just
applying this right on the inner upper
lash line moving on to my face I'm using
my Kat Von D contour kit I'm using this
middle shade and I'm applying it all
over my face
for blush I'm using this one by Mac it's
one of my favorites it's the mineralized
blush for lips I'm using one of my
favorites Mac stripped down
and then for lipstick I'm using also by
Mac the color pure Zen
picking up the same light pink color I
am applying this on the bridge of my
nose to give my nose that extra
highlight I'm also going to be applying
this light gold shade right on my cheeks
I'm only using a tiny tiny bit I didn't
want to be too too shimmery for this
look so again I only use a little bit
and then to top the look off I'm using
my Mario but that school rose water
spray
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video again if you
want to see my second birthday look
which I don't even know what I'm gonna
be doing yet or what I'm gonna be
wearing so if you guys want to see that
definitely let me know again thank you
all for being so amazing and so patient
with me during this very hard time but I
do know that he is in a better place as
much as we all would love him to still
be here with us we can only hope that
where he is right now he's at peace and
I know he'll be with me every single day
because he's in my heart so I love you
guys so much thank you for watching also
before I leave I wanted to let you guys
know that I will have another video up
tomorrow morning this one I filmed a
couple weeks back and that will be up
tomorrow at 10 a.m.
also I am selling some more stuff out of
my closet with the big move coming I
have put aside so much stuff that I want
to sell all of them are basically brand
new items some may be worn once or twice
but everything is going to be super
affordable
I started every single listing at only
99 cents they will be up for one day so
24 hours Dipsy percent of all proceeds
are going to be donated to hopefully a
couple charities depending on how much
we make if it is enough I will
definitely do more than one I don't know
exactly what charities yet we already
did a first round about a month ago this
is going to be the second round we're
probably going to do three or four
rounds total and then that way we can
get a nice chunk I could take 50% of
those proceeds and we can donate them to
a couple charities I know one that I
definitely want to donate to is for the
Diabetes Foundation my Papa had diabetes
he also got dialysis a couple times a
week so those were two charities that I
was thinking of donating to and his name
which is really special to me so again I
will list all of the details below that
way you guys can go check it out and I'm
so happy to say that a lot of the
pre-orders are all going out and my
palette blue back so soon officially if
you guys didn't check out my last video
where I explained how you can preorder
it I will list that video right here you
can go check it out and again anyone
interested in the eBay account to see
some stuff that I'm selling for my
closet the link will be listed below
and I believe everything's going live at
9 a.m. tomorrow morning so I have
another video and
clothes going up so anyone who wants to
check it out feel free to check back
tomorrow and I love you guys so much
thank you all for being so supportive it
means everything to me and I will see
you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
