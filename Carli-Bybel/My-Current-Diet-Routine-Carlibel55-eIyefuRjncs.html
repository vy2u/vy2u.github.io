a wall simple estimation
from the way
hi everyone thank you for watching so a
lot of you guys have been asking for an
updated diet routine and I think it's
been probably about a year and a half
since I posted my last one and a lot has
changed so I wanted to go over a few
things that I've been doing differently
so if you guys want to learn please keep
watching so the last video I did
dedicated to my diet and exercise I
basically explained how I just drank a
lot of water I ate healthy and I was not
really exercising so one of the biggest
changes that I've made the past 7 months
was obviously start exercising and I do
owe that all to Brett because he is a
personal trainer and he loves the gym so
he would always be dragging me there
with him and any time so I would try and
make excuses as to why I didn't want to
go he would find a way to get me there
so it's funny because they say that it
takes about like 20 days to form a habit
and I actually really enjoy going to the
gym now which is cool because that
completely changed so besides working
out and staying active which is
obviously so important I did it change
up my diet a lot so a year or two back
one of the things that I did which was
completely wrong was eat one to two full
meals per day and I figured you know I'm
small I'm only 5'4 too I don't really
need to eat that much in order to lose
weight but I realized after a couple
months of doing that that that was
obviously not the answer
I noticed not only did I feel like my
metabolism slowed down but if I would
eat something really fattening
I feel like instantly I would gain like
5 pounds back and I think just because
eating less makes your metabolism go
slower it just all kind of threw
everything off whack and it was not
working out for me I'm very short so 5
pounds looks like 10 pounds on maybe
someone a little bit taller
I have only lost a total of 10 pounds so
it's not a dramatic weight loss what I
did was I started eating healthier
eating more meals a day which sped up my
metabolism again working out and eating
really really healthy foods so I just
wanted to go over some of my favourite
healthy foods that I love to eat the
number one would definitely be protein
smoothies I know Brett had recently
posted a video showing you how he made
his smoothie I just wanted to quickly
tell you how I do mine I love mixing
mine with either
fresh or frozen fruit I love pineapples
mangoes strawberries anything like that
I mix it with nonfat milk and also I
like using the breakfast essentials it's
this little powder form and it's vanilla
flavor the one that I get and it has all
kinds of nutrients and vitamins in it so
it's really really good for you and it's
a good way to start your day and
honestly if you try these smoothies if
you put in the right ingredients it
really tastes so delicious and it
honestly tastes like a treat or a
dessert another thing I love to eat is
oatmeal
I love the oatmeal from Starbucks
actually it's so so so good but it's a
little expensive so if you wanted to buy
a bigger box
I recommend the Quaker Oats I love the
maple brown sugar one they do have a low
sugar and a weight control version so
they do have a little bit less calories
in those I also recommend steel-cut oats
and it's basically the same thing it's
just completely plain so I would
recommend buying some brown sugar and
adding it in for that one thing I can
eat literally every single day or ten
times a day is grilled chicken Brett
loves to cook which is awesome and he
cooks the grilled chicken almost I'm not
going to say every night I'm going to
say every three days maybe even every
four days and what he likes to do is
cook up a lot of it so that way we just
have it right in the fridge so for a
snack during the day or for lunch you
can just grab a piece of grilled chicken
throw it on some brown rice or whatever
and it's super yummy if you guys want to
see how he usually perhaps the chicken
that we eat he has different spices and
all kinds of yummy stuff to put in it so
I will link his video where he shows you
how to prep the chicken when we do cook
we love to have some sort of vegetables
on the side what's really cool is at
Wegmans they have pre-cut vegetables and
a little container and they have like
onions and peppers and everything to
really make a nice stir fry in it so you
can dump it all in and you're all set or
you can just buy actual vegetables and
then cut them up separately and use them
as you like I personally like pepper
zucchini corn broccoli pea pods
everything like that so it's really cool
because if you just add all the veggies
with the chicken and maybe some balsamic
or some vinegar on it it gives it such
amazing flavor and if you guys aren't
into that kind of stuff some people are
probably like oh my god
grilled chicken all that stuff I can't
eat it that's so gross but it's funny
because so much of these things that I
eat now I never really liked I hated and
I refused to try but I kind of opened up
my mind to a lot of new things and I
kind of tricked myself into liking it so
if I didn't really like it I would just
keep eating it and then now it's funny
because I like it better than for
instance grilled chicken I love better
plain than a fried chicken with like
ketchup which five years ago I would
have never said anything like that if
you aren't into healthy foods it's only
because you've been too used to all this
processed junk that's out there and you
really need to eat healthy because you
only have one body and you need to take
care of it so eating 1 to 2 meals a day
is not going to do anything it's not
going to help you lose weight and it's
just going to overall give you health
problems so it's so important to have
five to six small meals a day and
whether it's a granola bar or it's a
smoothie in between each meal that's
fine unfortunately for me I'm allergic
to most fruits which is horrible I can
have them in a smoothie but for instance
like an apple I can't bite into it or
any fresh food if I bite into it my gums
get all swollen and I get itchy which is
just so annoying but I have that my ways
to work around that another food that
I'm going to mention that I'm so in love
with are the Kashi bars I actually have
one right here um I was thinking it
before they're the go lean dipped in
chocolate bars this one is the peanut
butter flavor but I also love the
chocolate malt flavor and honestly I
could eat like ten of those a day
they're so good they are very filling
because I have protein and everything in
it and what's really cool is that it's
covered in chocolate so if you're
craving chocolate or you're craving
something sweet it's going to be a
healthy alternative to an actual candy
bar or anything like that
and if you think about it candy bars if
you bite into it yeah it's like really
good for a couple of minutes but it
doesn't fill you up it leaves me
personally feeling like kind of nauseous
afterwards
so these cashew ours are a great
alternative as for drinks I drink
probably okay I don't even know twenty
equivalents of twenty water bottles a
day I drink so much water I honestly
think in a past life I was a mermaid or
a fish as getting my friends they also
agree but yeah I love water
I don't drink any sodas any diet things
I don't really recommend they don't put
anything good in those diet drinks think
about it what are they doing to that
drink to make a diet you never know so
stick with water it's the healthiest
option in my opinion I love drinking
green tea as well and for Starbucks one
thing I love to get is a iced nonfat
chai and it's only like 200 calories for
a venti and it's made with nonfat milk
so it's good for you it's so filling and
it makes you have to pee a lot so I
definitely recommend trying the choice
from Starbucks if you haven't yet
they're super super super yummy and I've
probably been drinking them for about
ten years now it's funny because I used
to get them with regular milk and
whipped cream on top and I remember once
I accidentally tried it with nonfat milk
and I was like oh this is so gross but
after a while I was like you know what
all this whole milk is way too much it's
too much making my stomach hurt so I
switched over to nonfat and it took me a
little bit to get into it but now I like
suck it down at like 10 minutes and so
so so so obsessed that so think about it
anything that you're doing on a daily
basis that maybe you feel like you can't
live without try a different alternative
to it most people love soda and they
love like the fizziness of it but they
actually have these new Seltzer's out
they have different flavored ones they
have cherry orange a couple of different
ones and they're actually so yummy so if
you just try some of those in place of
the soda that could also help I actually
heard if you stopped drinking soda in
one year I think you'll lose like ten
pounds or something crazy like that but
ladies any of you guys interested in
losing weight or starting up your
exercise routine I highly suggest
subscribing to Brett's channel because
he does everything from healthy cooking
to workouts at home and for the guys out
there he's going to start doing
different workouts at the gym so he
loves seeing what you guys want to see
so if you guys have any kind of requests
you can just comment it on his channel
and he'll be sure to get it up for you
guys so that is basically all that has
changed for my diet and exercise so it
basically changed completely but moral
of the story is once you start eating
healthy and once you start working out
you will become more fit and more
confident and everything just kind of
starts tightening up so for those who
are worried about my weight loss I just
wanted to assure you that I am
she's the healthiest I've been in a long
time and I'm really proud that I've
stuck to it and that I've seen results
and I've seen results the healthy way I
didn't
I don't eat 1 to 2 meals a day anymore
and I actually workout and it's just so
much better so for those of you who are
caught on the fence wanting to change
but not really sure how please ask your
questions to either me or Brett and
we'll be sure to answer you because it
sometimes is hard to get motivated into
starting but once you start I promise
you it's going to become so rewarding
and you're going to just feel so much
better I hope this video helped you guys
