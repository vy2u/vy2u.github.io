today I'm here with Brett I'm gonna be
talking about my current diet routine
and I figured instead of doing it alone
what I'm going to bring him in with me
because he's the reason I'm in such
great shape so little credit here so
okay
well you're one of the just go bear
breeding like right now so I tweeted
asking what you guys wanted to see next
and I feel like if my diet routine slash
workout routine was the number one most
requested video so I knew your today we
would sit down and talk about my diet
what I eat on a daily basis and then
next week me and Brad are going to
finally films on my workouts um where we
live now in our basement we're setting
it up as a gym which is really cool
because it makes it a lot easier to work
out so we're just waiting on our way
back and then we're going to show you
some of my workouts that I do at home
and then also what I do at the gym so
before I get into what I eat on like a
normal day I just wanted to first say
that when we do go food shopping I think
the number one thing that I recommend
for you guys is to make sure you're
buying things that are healthy and
things that are organic and things that
are gluten free
um well I think that's what yeah you
need your like tell a little more about
this I know you're you're better at this
whole yeah I think thing cuz food is so
industrialized or stripping what gives
people allergies because it's so
processed so gluten free is something
that we go with like if we're going to
have pizza and we want to make pizza or
something like that
we'll get gluten free dough or if we're
going to be doing like pasta
you know if I'm at a restaurant make
gluten free there that'd be nice too the
reason that I started eating gluten free
really used to do gluten-free but I feel
like you guys know I've had such a
struggle with my eczema so we've been
trying to pinpoint what exactly it is
that's causing it because I now know
that it's definitely something that I'm
eating and it's not anything that's on
the outside so when we were going
through and try and figure out what it
was we knew that sushi was one of the
triggers and then we also realize that
like whenever I would have like grains
and anything was like you would say
ahead gluten in it well yeah well they
look I'm reading to it it talks about
gluten is so bad for us and affects your
brain yeah you know Jemaine about the
brain also look the lack of time just
going to tell you basically says carbs
have been a big reason as to why were
they have a lot of problems as a society
and why you know people are age like
even you guys out there a lot of us
might have diabetes we don't even know
it the beginning stages of diabetes and
talked about medication leads to other
diseases other problems and stuff like
that but it goes into the fact that
certain things that are in grains affect
our brain that's why it's called brain
worry now not all grains there's
obviously good grains out thing like
kumoi which I put in a lot of things
that we have a lot of soups uttereth
also you know certain grains I know are
healthy they're looking for their good
I'll make sure we get but as far as like
white bread and like all the white flour
foods you know they won't have pulled
any nutritional value processed foods if
you're going to have them always once in
a while and I think that's like the
biggest problem just everything we've
been really taught it's kind of like
opposite right as to what is really good
for our bodies I know we should keep as
I go before my video like basically yeah
it's Carly's diet and my guy I mean it
fluctuates said he things don't fart
nice for him
I do a lot of research for myself and
I'm finding out that we live in a world
everything's industrialized including
food and it's not just food it's
everything right especially an act that
I want America especially yeah
for instance of french fries here have
like 40 minutes I'm just saying so it's
like right like you were saying
industrialized food it's like the food
that we're eating these people are
making money it's a business for them
it's not it's not actual food it's no
different than the forever 21 sweater
you're wearing if it's for cheap
America's well different obviously the
food are not getting away from the food
then there's food banned excuse me in
other countries that we allow here you
know and I mean what is that say that's
a red enough flag for me right there and
just say like whoa we got to take a step
back and kind of look readjust the way
you go about your diet you won't ever
see us in a fast-food joint
and I know that but I'm talking about
the regulars like Burger King McDonald's
you won't ever see us there but if I'm
going to be at a like a restaurant and
you know once in a LOF you want to just
have like a french fries or i know
french fries are cancer-causing food
because of carcinogens and stuff but
it's really if you made your own french
fries at your house from your own
potatoes and you put them in your own
oil and use all clean and good that's
fine my god I don't think there would
ever be a problem that the problem is
everywhere we go even the best
restaurants the quality isn't as great
you know some of its most of its not
organic unless they say it'll always say
on the menu most of them probably had
GMOs and they're trying to make profit
we're just the look that as a number and
you know they got a new Dakota record so
it's just it's really balancing that
knowing that and make sure what you like
or what you should be eating and
balancing you know a couple sheets here
and there that's really what it's all
about but living in the fear of like
thinking everything is going to make you
sick that's not how we want you to think
that's how I want her thing it's just
being aware and be knowledgeable think
about what we grew up on like gushers
and Twinkies and yoo-hoos and all of
those things I want to see people might
not myself eating
why it makes me like it brings my heart
because so many people don't know about
this because no one really does their
research they just think oh well if
they're Sonia that's the market I must
be good when in reality look 90% of the
things that they're selling are not good
I know you had once told me that I don't
know if you had a quote or something
where what if I told you you could eat
whatever you want whenever you want to
gauge time to make it from scratch and
that's like the reality if you actually
want to make french fries as you just
said or you want to have an apple pie or
something like that and you're making it
yourself and you know what ingredients
are going in it that is going to be
better for you than if you just go out
to the storage buy whatever they're
putting out on the shelves another thing
that popped into my head was I saw this
thing on Instagram I call all these
accounts on Instagram because it's just
it's really cool to learn about all this
stuff and it showed a person watering a
plant and then handing their kid sugary
type of drink so it just says why would
you feed your plant water and give your
kids something that's completely bad for
them so I feel like that's another big
thing you don't ever really drink sugary
drinks at all I drink water
all day long like that's when you ever
drink evers water and when I was little
I used to drink a lot of soda and a lot
of fruit juice and stuff like that I
used to hate water what aren't so plain
it's so gross and it's funny now because
to me what if it's amazing it's just so
refreshing so I feel like with anything
the more you do it the more your body
will get used to it and you'll start
liking it so if you think you don't like
water and you love your diet soda or
your coca-cola or whatever it is try
cutting it out and swapping it out with
water and that alone will help save
calories and it'll just help your body
overall work a lot better yeah I was
like looking this way the whole time
just processing what you were saying so
what maybe check
a dream that was just every one of these
things you're awfully in another world
that's just because I can't these lights
are so bright guys I don't know I'm just
like I can't look at the way all the
time so I got it well you don't look at
the light you look at the camera if you
guys are in a special occasion or you're
you know celebrating something don't
feel like you can't just you know don't
go in a while I don't want people to
think like I'm telling you to just
completely stop just know if you abuse
those types of things just like anything
else you're going to be like a drug you
know you're going to feel it of
consequences
so sugar it literally committee like the
cousin of cocaine like there's really no
difference to me because it gets you all
hyped up certain types of sugary are
healthier for us you know there's some
of them I possess the nutrients but
processed sugar and the white sugar the
stuff that's made readily available to
us and you know always in this
restaurants or in the coffee shops I
watched a lecture from a guy in UCLA and
he was showing the effects of sugar now
what causes cirrhosis of the liver these
little brown spots and that's just from
watching that lecture the list of things
that negatives ago sugar so bad oh if
you guys want to learn a little bit more
about sugar because people in my family
are still using like sweet and low and
equal and all that stuff he actually did
a video where he talked about right
doing have a video up where you talk
about all different sugars which ones
are good which ones are bad well I'm
sure about
it's called issues about artificial
sweeteners yes well like that right here
and you guys can go check that out
there's so many good informative videos
on his channel that if you want to learn
a little bit more about it you can
definitely go check that out but I feel
like for today we can talk about all the
stuff for hours but I feel like the main
purpose of this video is to talk about
what I personally eat right so um but
this all coincides with the changes
she's right exactly it's just about
learning and just these are things that
they've never taught us in school so
it's about reaching out and just finding
new ways to learn all about what you're
putting into your body like we care so
much about how we pull up how we dress
are you caring about what you're putting
inside because that's the number one
thing that's a number one thing you need
to worry about this I feel like no one
ever worries about that they're just
everyone's looking for the quickest way
to lose weight how to lose weight what
do I do when you die can I try this week
and I we always tell people like the
same thing and no one wants to hear
because it's not the perfect answer but
stay healthy and to stay fit is to just
eat healthy eat organic foods eat a lot
of fruits don't do a juice cleanse and
don't eat for a week because yet you may
be this five or ten pounds but as soon
as you eat it's going to all come back
so I feel like that's like the main
thing is just to stick with healthy
organic real foods and that is going to
help you reach any typical and of course
working out on top of that yeah food the
food industry to me is like music I
don't like stay on top of it to kind of
figure out what's going to what's not
because there's things like five years
ago they said was healthy that aren't
healthy for us and I figure it out later
in myself yeah rather than digging
yourself a hole and then can't
climb out of this hole later in life
just kind of stay you know abreast with
what's healthy or you can just follow
that channel and he can keep you up to
date because I know personally if I
wasn't dating him and I didn't have
someone constantly in my ear telling me
these things not that I wouldn't care
but I just feel like there's so many
other things in my life and your daily
life that's the last thing you're
thinking about is like what you're
putting in your mouth you know if it
tastes good and it's easy to be like
that's what you're going to go for so I
feel like it's just so important to
study up on this a little bit more maybe
check out that book that he had
recommended or even like on you can look
on YouTube not just his channel already
doing it also literally person know I
know
I personally watched your videos so I
that's why I feel like I can recommend
them because I've ever stood watch them
yeah I'm gonna take care of your body
yep so I think that was the number one
thing when you are food shopping make
sure you're looking for organic fruit
and no fructose corn see often not fruit
some types of dose corn syrup all those
little red flags less stuff that makes
food last yeah should be going bad
pretty weak or so so I'm lucky
Brett enjoys cooking a lot so he is most
of the time doing the cooking for like
lunch and dinner but I feel like my
breakfast I'm kind of always in charge
of my own breakfast we kind of do
different things for breakfast because
I'm way smaller so what I want what he
wants is completely different um so one
thing that I love making for myself all
the time is a green smoothie the one
that's my favorite I added in banana
pineapple mango spinach and milk
sometimes like a vegan vanilla protein
and then extra ice and blend all
together it's literally so good you
don't even taste the greens I know some
people are afraid of like those green
looking drinks but the fruit kind of
overpower it so it is really sweet and
it does fill you up which is really good
about me you're afraid of your drink
yeah cuz usually don't even taste green
and if it even if you can taste the
green even if it doesn't taste amazing
just know that your body is just saying
like thank you
I need this good I just got are taking
wheatgrass shots with you oh yeah those
are those are brutal I know a lot of
people are actually asking what those
shots were on our snapchat it's just
pure wheatgrass so if you go to like
Whole Foods or like a juice place you
can probably ask for it and they just
juice wheatgrass and it comes into a
little shot and it's so strong but if
you can take a shot of alcohol you can
take a shot of wheatgrass you can do it
it's literally don't complain that it's
expensive either because hey you will
pay you know $20 for a patron shot
exactly just so good for yours is it the
guys that's three and a half volts no
they're jacking the prices up I mean
yeah well that's the same president
Dunkin Donuts iced coffee but I mean we
would also juice it ourselves but we
don't have a juicer yeah I know they're
really expensive too
Oh we cut out milk completely that I
completely forgot to tell you guys you
were always drinking like skim milk
nonfat milk um and I did read somewhere
that it milk can be a cause for your
eczema as well and there's a million
other reasons why we're not drinking
cow's milk anymore you guys can do your
research on it but we switched over to
on milk and I personally think it tastes
better and the one that we happen says
it has like 50% more calcium than actual
milk right so I don't know I think I
should try it out the one thing that I
heard that made me not wondering milk
anymore was like if a baby calf drinks
its mother's milk to turn into a
400-pound cow why would a human drink
the cow's milk it just doesn't make
sense
well they also zap the milk they make
sure you know there's so much stuff that
goes into what they do to the milk after
it comes out of the cabinets the milk
leaves the cow it's just like obviously
they're processing it there's a pin it
there making sure you know they're
getting rid of all that stuff but what's
the cow eating how are they treating the
cow you're not raising the cow they
treat them like profit products you know
stuff on the market that it's going to
make them money so they're going to give
them cheap corn to eat and then that's
what you're drinking that's the milk you
drink itself
you had your cat outside and it was your
own cat when you're feeding it grass and
all that stuff then maybe I would drink
the milk but you guys gotta watch
conspiracy that teams are out look a lot
and there's no like slaughtering or
anything in that documentary
so that's strictly for me which is
really good it's just a really piece of
a huge puzzle reasons why we should
really come back on like cut back on
animal agriculture but yeah that's good
we're getting away from anyway so what
else I eat so I love to eat eggs also in
the morning I'll have like two eggs and
a piece
toasts the exit we buy our
pasture-raised and they have all the
non-gmo and humane right like the humane
logo so you just got to like look on the
packaging obviously some packaging might
FBI a hundred percent truthful but we
try our best to get the one that seems
to be the best healthiest leche you know
so what else what else so another thing
that I love is on y'all sometimes I'll
get like the gluten free packet ones but
we also make some notes in the morning
as well which is amazing I sometimes we
have that for lunch if there's nothing
else to eat so that's basically all I
can think of as far as what I like for
breakfast um I guess the lunch and
dinner we can kind of like combine
different ideas that we always make um
how about that salad make college I just
so you know how so to see her shake that
she likes I have it on my trailer and
posted it oh yeah yep shake if that
should work at that Super Bowl salad
that's the sound just link to the room
yeah I'll link a lot of that below for
lunch item we have salad so I'll put a
good quality chicken on top I usually
just get stir-fried chicken like it's
all cut off already it's like the only
chicken I really been eating lately
that's organic non-gmo all that and I'll
put that on top of everything where they
just a lot of greens I'm cooking with a
lot of soups I've been making lately no
red meat we've covered me up completely
so I used to be bigger on steaks and he
was and I loved a good burger not gonna
lie but ever since I've watched when
these documentaries I completely cut out
be from my diet altogether you know once
in a while if we cheat we cheat you know
once in a while it's really not that
much but not red meat that's the thing
I've made a constant yeah permanent
change as to not eat red meat anymore
like I said a lot of sounds a lot of
fresh foods a lot of foods that are grow
from the ground healthy foods that help
our body just I'm looking for foods I'm
going to benefit
benefit me make us feel good not foods
in turn and hold us back so for women I
know a lot of you have to have a hard
time because you know it's hard hard to
be a woman in today's world honestly
especially with the food and stay
physically in shape but don't forget
like exercise doesn't matter I mean you
can eat as good as you can eat but
exercise helps you feel good about
yourself and you know you're getting
things done on accomplishing things so
make sure you're doing that as well but
not eating is not the way to go if you
need to give your body food I had a
friend who was so out of shape
he ate way too fast like he just didn't
give a you just ain't so much you
care at all times of the day you went a
vegan for like maybe two months and just
ate fruits and vegetables strictly and
grains and he couldn't keep weight on
like when you eat that type of food your
body works at such a high level that you
burn fat so much faster so it's not
something that you can do right
overnight either and you have to do it
consistently day by day by day and you
will see the changes alright we look in
the mirror every day to ourselves we
don't see a change but over the course
of time you do change so you have to
just stick with it it's really important
you have to stay loyal to yourself a lot
of it is mental obedience you have to
stay disciplined and knowing what you do
like if you're going out with friends
and they want to get fried food and they
want to eat bad you got to separate
yourself alright it's going to look
weird your friends probably to be like
you're weird whatever kenwood they're
saying they're not they're not you the
number even your loans you know that's
really the big message and I wanted to
like say in this video because for Carly
every day could change I just make sure
we get some type of food in our body you
don't have a couple hours for me I mean
a lot more than she does so I'll always
have pot double or triple the portion
size whatever we're making foods that
give you guys heartburn don't eat those
foods whose it give you acid indigestion
don't eat those food you know your body
speaking to you just listen to your body
and that's the main thing I would tell
you guys - I just if you're feeling like
crap after eating something there's a
reason you know if you feel good after
eating something you're digesting it
well and I know this sounds weird but
your poops are good you have a lot of
diarrhea
obviously you're not doing very
for your gut you digesting bad you know
your gut health is so important cuz it
transitions to your brain
that's all really as far as what you've
been eating water a lot of water
sometimes she likes that green tea which
I do as well but she also drinks hot
green tea white tea chug through the
bags because I've been trying not to get
Starbucks very much because it's
obviously not good for you a little
manuka honey and then on the milk we do
sometimes buy vegan chocolate chip
cookies though what's your for yeah yeah
you can't just it's unrealistic to just
say you're only going to eat fruits and
vegetables and salads and all this stuff
like I know people know but I saw the
number one thing was like do you have
cheat days and you're that and like yes
we do like we're not just so strict that
we don't eat whatever we want but if you
are strict 90% of the time and you're
constantly putting this up in your body
if you have one cheat day here and there
it's not going to kill you I just don't
think the name double the day cheat days
I don't like that I just I got you a
meal no there's no cheating you're not
cheat you just if you want to have a
food you want to have just have it but
make sure you're supplementing that with
healthier foods so make sure every day
you're not giving in and eating
something I make a lot of vegetables for
our like I'll grow mushrooms as a
replacement for me sometimes and it's
religious a lot of seasoning I got
season everything I really truly believe
you could really make anything taste
like meat if you see it the right way
and that's really what idea up a lot of
garlic on stuff garlic guacamole
avocados are so good for you
cough malaise literally life and then I
like to dip um
tomatoes in guacamole also hummus is
another good like snack yeah but not
like sod rhombic we don't do I don't
know oh we go
yeah we get the 100's bro I like the
roasted red pepper one so you can either
dip like peppers tomatoes celery I'm
going to celery Oh a lot of watermelon
I'm obsessed with watermelon but you're
still fruits and vegetables into like
that I'm just trying to think like
whenever something pops in since I'm not
trying to lose weight I've been like
just maintaining and I've noticed like
eating this way he's helped me maintain
are there any like specific tips that
you would give someone who's trying to
lose weight or any other you got to be
whatever you're doing there needs to be
some type of sacrifice in what you do
replace with something you know
something else it's not working for you
and I know everyone's story is a little
different because not one person is the
same but we all had the same organs a
lot of clean healthy foods guys and I
know a lot of you out there on a budget
I mean everybody has their own situation
that they're in if you're young and you
live in like your house still and your
family doesn't really cater to what your
desires are so well get some stuff by
yourself
if you have to you can really eat on a
budget organically fun simulator farmers
markets that sell things for cheap you
know also when you're in the supermarket
and I tell you this all times usually
with me things that they want to get rid
of are always going to be at eye level
they're always going to push the Xfire
the close your expiration dates to the
front
I dig through everything I'm like a
frickin fair in that thing digging
through is fair it's good we've eaten
like seafood a little bit with fish like
out sometimes I may walk on sand there
but only wild caught salmon is what
happened now tell them about the salmon
you know this yeah everything's like GMO
salmon like what make know if it's GMO
because it's chlorides would like the
white stripes in it what makes you know
if it's mild cough it's like a red color
yeah so that's another thing or what you
guys to know Salmons really good for us
right it's got a lot of good healthy
fats which are good for our brain good
for our cholesterol levels just has to
be wild-caught already well the reason
we cut down our seafood is because well
sushi is my number-one like favorite
meal ever but again
yes thank you always flares up we have
suji sets throw me like the fish is
probably low grade too probably sprained
it with some to make sure it doesn't go
bad it doesn't smell it's so funny
because like to me all these things
sound great but I know some of you guys
washing that watch ants or pie like like
what what you just get your spoon I know
but like your body is still used to
eating junk that you're craving junk all
the time but once you cut it out you
slowly like don't crave that stuff
anymore I know it doesn't seem like
that's the truth but it really is I
promise you because I just eat fast food
I used to eat junk food
I see whatever the hell I wanted before
this one came into my life because I
just never thought about it I never
figured that that was a problem I mean I
always struggled with my weight
I've always was on a diet and I always
wanted to lose weight but I was never
able to lose weight and it's because I
was eating processed foods and kind of
just like whatever I wanted along with
the diagonals and the frozen meals that
are filled with salt and all that stuff
so again it all tends back to just
eating real stuff that the earth
provides for us Ashley Paige wants to
know what's your best tip for staying
motivated I think that's like the
biggest problem like you get that
motivation kick and then maybe I feel
like a week or two you kind of just like
fall back into the old habit so what
could be like what's do you have any
tips for her if you're trying to lose
weight don't want yourself every day by
the week you'll never be satisfied
looking at being on the scale every day
so you're not going to see a constant
change but if you take time in between
will notice you know significant
differences also you know if you need or
Novation music is a great thing honestly
make sure you're sending of music
something makes you happy stuff that
takes you back to happy memories
surround yourself of people who want to
see you do better you know they want you
know it goes both ways you know people
that you help to funny because of sight
it's the same thing as food you want to
you have to keep your mental outlook on
everything fresh and up to speed with it
and if you need to go on run there's
some lot of good stuff this guy Eric
Thomas I found online let's go up thank
God it's Monday I posted it to my
snapchat yesterday and he'll help do
motivational speeches it's all about how
you react
thing and the way you're thinking about
it and when you can turn something so
negative and positively
you know don't climb the mountain sorry
but I can see you you know climb the
mountains you can see the world and I
love that quote that's something that
I've always tried to think of lately
just trying to stay good you know just
do it for you
so you can better yourself don't do it
because someone's influencing you to do
it or we're up here trying to tell you
how to live your life if this is
something that you don't want to do
nobody I don't want to see anybody
unhappy if if junk food makes your happy
thing eat junk food but I mean so for a
fad down yeah you're gonna forget if you
have mood swings you know your family
people around you it affects everybody
you know it's not just you and don't
quit on yourself so easy to quit stay
with your your goal set something there
hold yourself accountable you know how
are you going to say you want to be one
one way and then put on yourself and
then expect to get other things done in
your life you'll always quit you know
you'll always know that you just quit
incall quits and that does affect the
people around you I know for just having
us because we have this conversation
with everybody all the time users are
always constantly asking us like people
in our own lives and I think the number
one thing people are always doing is
like they know that their number one
thing they want to do is lose weight but
they're constantly doing a million other
things to help feel like fill that hole
elsewhere like for instance buying
clothes or shopping or doing doing this
or doing that instead of actually doing
the one main thing that's the actual
problem and I know the hardest thing is
staying motivated and kind of like what
he was already talking about like if you
want to try and read some books that are
like motivating I have a couple good
ones that I read that I've been reading
that stuff yeah because when you can
figure out how to like work with your
thoughts and change it the way you think
that is the main way that can help you
reach your goals because without
changing your mind you're not going to
be able to change anything else you need
to change something that's in your daily
routine Lebanese common how can you make
kale more tasty and enjoyable
we Kayla yeah you could really do a lot
to kale that's the beauty of it I would
throw in suits because it literally
turns into like a tender meat that's
crazy I would never have thought I'd be
like craving tailing a stupid super
beans and stuff like that but this stuff
is delicious if you spice it the right
way also if you want to make like kale
chips you don't break y'all off that was
it a little bit of like olive oil with
spices and stuff like that over the oven
kale chips are good kale salads too I
mean throw Kelly with whatever dressing
you like don't in shakes that's the way
we eat it too obviously yeah Mariana
wants to know what do you drink
take or eat before working out to boost
your energy your beautiful love you the
smoothies I like to workout in the
morning usually so I'll have like my
morning smoothie and then I'll just have
the energy to go work out fruits like
I'll always we always buy like three
things of bananas at once because I love
just being able to grab a banana and
then it fills me up and it gives me some
energy as well just making sure whatever
you eat you don't go to the gym on a
full stomach and your body's digested it
and make sure you're drinking you're
hydrated now they wants to know how to
stop craving like how to stop cravings I
feel like I remember that was like my
biggest thing I remember when I was like
trying to diet hardcore when I was like
younger and know what I was doing by
like eight or nine o'clock at night I
would just be like oh so hungry
sort of bets like what do you eat you
have to take things out of your sight
because if they're not in your sight
they're not there to grab you're not
going to grab them right so that's a big
thing those fruit pops frozen fruit pops
that we have this grape once that's a
sweet potato all that that's actually a
good thing and I'm probably good to have
like at night you know fresh fruit
frozen there I was in food bars maybe
sure they're good quality oh yeah
maritza wants to know I'm trying to get
lean but build muscle how do you manage
cardio without burning too much muscle
you don't have to go crazy with cardio
walk instead of run there's other ways
to do cardio rather than just getting on
a treadmill obviously swim try to hit
some steam rooms because that'll help
you to as well
breathe you know honestly like I know
this is gonna sound stupid but we just
we don't take enough time to breathe and
we don't think about time that
those are two things I wanna say I'm
glad we all breathe do we breathe like
we just we kind of cheat ourselves in
one example of real breath ready yeah he
knows I think - make sure your chest
comes out so literally if you were being
suffocated under water and you had to
get that gasp of air in to your body you
should take ten minutes a day just to
then I sit there breathe give your body
oxygen also with chewing - when you're
chewing your food make sure you chew it
up good don't chew chew chew and swallow
like if your foods hot wait just wait I
know it looks delicious I'm not sir
I'm so guilty of that he's always a
chili our friend if you swallow food
that's a chunk of food it's going to be
that much harder for your body to digest
and break down right so I'm going
through a lot of these questions and a
lot of them we've either already covered
or we've just answered now I feel like
the thing I keep seeing is just kind of
my cravings and how do you prevent like
urges and I really honestly think that
once you
over your like your diet in your
lifestyle you start eating healthier a
lot of those cravings are going to go
away the reason you're getting some of
those cravings is because your body is
craving something that's not real like
like sugar and candy or stuff like that
like you think you're craving that but
it's actually just like playing a trick
on yourself so once you start eating
healthier like the cravings really go
away obviously I'm hungry I have my
breakfast lunch dinner and then a snack
here and there but it's so crazy because
I don't know I just feel like I was
always constantly on a diet and trying
different things and I would never ever
ever lose weight and then when I just
stopped triangle stupid little fads and
just kind of ate healthy and just
exercise regularly like that's really
all it takes so I think that's really
the main thing and I know a lot of
people want to have like that quick face
or that oh well we do this and I do this
and that's how I stay slim or whatever
but unfortunately that's not how it is
we all have different bodies but it's
all about just finding like what is your
happy medium for yourself and just kind
of feeling comfortable in your own skin
so I think that's it for now I'm sure
this video was already too long thank
you so much for coming in and helping me
talk about all this stuff because I know
I would not have covered half of it if
you weren't here and I'm very blessed
because I have him on a daily basis to
keep me motivated and to keep reminding
me of all this stuff so I feel like if
you are losing some motivation maybe
come back to this video and rewatch it
and then you have your own personal
breath to tell you what to do so
everybody should have someone to like
hang out for your best interest right
and if you come in you won't have that
friend who's constantly bringing you
down and trying to get you off of that
track exactly you don't need that person
in your life you need to tell them if
this is something you really want to do
they should back you up 100% and never
ever pressure you or make you feel like
you're doing something wrong because at
the end
day we all need to be healthy to live a
long healthy life and it starts now it
starts when we're young and if we're not
some carrot now where it's going to be
too late so I feel like that's one thing
with humans like we don't learn for
ourselves until something bad happens
and this is us sitting you're trying to
help prevent that for you guys we don't
want any of you guys stick or are you
getting any of these diseases from some
of the shooting food that's out there so
we have to also thing to not to ramble
but just pollution in general already is
does a number on us because they're
breathing
shayera sometimes so you got to think
about other things that don't involve
putting food in your mouth and then
realize like you know you're drinking
alcohol you smoke cigarettes and you're
eating bad food I mean you're just like
dribbling it which just cut one thing
out at a time one day at a time don't
don't try to over set your goals I mean
yeah always reach as far as you can with
what you're doing and set yourself on
risk unrealistically so you could reach
some type of good goal but you want to
also be realistic with yourself and once
you start making those changes the
positive changes you'll also notice
people in your life that still are
sticking to that negative form your
frame of mind and you know the balls in
your court whether you want to help them
or just you know cut them off like that
habit so all right so that is it for now
