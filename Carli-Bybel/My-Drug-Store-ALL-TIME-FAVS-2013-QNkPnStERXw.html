wanted to put together this video for
you guys I know a lot of you have been
asking for drugstore tutorials or
anything like that so I wanted to gather
up some of my favorite all-time
drugstore products and just share them
with you guys because for anyone on a
budget or someone who's not a fan of
online shopping
I know drugstores come in handy so
really quickly I'm just gonna be going
through a couple of my all-time favorite
products that I have been using for a
while and then I do back up a hundred
percent so if you guys want to hear what
they are then please keep watching so
the first thing that I'm going to be
talking about is from L'Oreal and I just
picked this up about two weeks ago it's
the miracle blur and it's called an
instant skin smoother when I saw this it
was like on display in the Walgreens and
I had just walked in and I was like what
is that it must be new but it's so cool
because it has SPF 30 in it and you just
apply it onto your skin and what it's
supposed to do is it's supposed to blur
out any fine lines and diminish those
pores and I wasn't buying it so I was
like let me try it out and see if this
actually works but if you apply this to
your skin with absolutely nothing on it
so weird but it really does make your
pores disappear and your fine lines
disappear I don't know what is in it but
I like to use this underneath my
foundation now because I guess it's kind
of like a filler of some sort they do
suggest to reapply every two hours if
you are going out in the Sun because I'm
assuming the SPF isn't that strong but I
tried this out and if you want to do it
maybe no makeup makeup look or if you're
trying to just not put any makeup on and
you want to smooth everything out I
highly recommend this also by L'Oreal I
came across the magic nude liquid powder
foundation and I've been using this and
a bunch of my newer tutorials this
foundation is basically my new favorite
I do love the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation but that one's so much more
expensive and you can get that at
Sephora but it's a lot more money so
when I came across these I was like how
perfect is this they're very inexpensive
and they work really really well they
have I would say medium to light
coverage but what you have to do is you
have to shake it before you use it I
know a couple people were asking why is
it come out so runny and liquidy
it is liquid but if you do shake it
really well it will be more of a
foundation and not I won't be as
separated because I think if you don't
shake it it's more separated and it's
more runny
the colors that I use are Sun beige and
I was Tanner but that tans gone because
my spray tan where'd off but I was using
classic tan as well for when I was
tanner so in a couple of videos I wore
this lipstick color that I have on right
now and a lot of you are asking where
that pink was from so the covergirl I
think these are crippled yeah covergirl
lipsticks I have my two favorite ones
are hot passion and enchantress it's
always weird pronouncing that one but
took a nice light pink color and then a
nice bright red and these two I use all
the time I've had these for over a year
everything's getting all rubbed off you
could barely tell the name of it but I
just remember these so for a drugstore
lipstick I do definitely recommend the
covergirl they're nice and they're
pigmented and I like them because
they're not too dry so when you put them
on it kind of gives you more of like a
lipstick and a gloss look as opposed to
just a matte lipstick because I have
very dry lips so I noticed when I use a
drier lipstick it starts to crease in
here more which I hate and it's so
annoying to get off so I've been very
happy with these two for I'm gonna say
at least a year now so I definitely
recommend the covergirl lipsticks since
this is my drugstore all-time favorite
video I could not not mention these
three products that I use in basically
every single video my mascara my
eyeliner and my lip liner these two are
by Jordana and this one is the L'Oreal
telescopic and if you've watched most of
my makeup tutorials I probably used all
three of these these lip liners are like
$1.99 and the eyeliners are I'm gonna
say like 229 so it's such a bargain and
I use this especially this lip liner
every single day like I'm not even being
dramatic I have at least ten of them
because I always have them in purses and
I misplaced them but yeah so I love
those and this mascara goes without
saying I'm obsessed with it and I did
here it was getting discontinued
although they still are restocking it in
my Walgreens it just always is empty
shelves when I go but from what I know
they're not
continuing it I know I mentioned that in
another video so let's keep our fingers
crossed ladies so next I'm going to be
moving on to some facial products or
skincare products that I am loving and
that I've loved the first thing I'm
going to talk about are the Biore strips
and for those of you who don't know what
they are they take out the blackheads so
it's their deep cleansing poor strips
all you do is you wet your nose they
also come with face strips so if you
have blackheads under your chin or in
between your eyebrows on your forehead
or anything you can use them for that
part as well the way you do it is you
just wet your face completely you want
to leave it wet and you apply it and
then once it starts getting hard you
just rip it off and it's so gross but I
really love using these and I love when
I rip it off to see all the blackheads
that it pulls out and it really does
pull out a lot so if you're like me and
you are makeup all the time you need to
unclog your pores and sometimes like a
blackhead scrub isn't enough I have a
bunch of different blackhead facial
cleansers and I mean I've noticed I
guess some difference but if you want to
really extract those bad boys I suggest
the VRA strips
actually it's so funny because Brett
used one the other night and when he
like ripped it off I was like oh look at
all that goodness and he was like that's
just disgusting but for me I like seeing
that at work so I like to inspect it and
make sure all the blackheads cut out
also for your face I am obsessed with
the Seabreeze astringent and I probably
mentioned this in another drugstore
video but I've been using this since
high school whenever I would get
breakouts which I still do sometimes but
when I were whenever I would get really
bad breakouts I would use this along
with a cotton ball to apply it and it's
funny because if you wash your face even
with if you have a brush cleanser like I
use that Olay cleanser but sometimes
I'll brush and wash my face completely
off and I'll think all the makeups off
but then I'll use a little bit of the
astringent with a cotton ball couldn't
think of it with it cotton ball and I'll
see that there's still either a little
blackheads coming out or some makeup
that's still coming off so it's good to
use this because you're gonna make sure
your face is very very deeply clean
and it also it's like gives it not a
burning feeling but if you have a pimple
you feel it like burn the pimple so you
know that it's doing its job so I really
really love this I've been using this
for like eight years now and it's really
basic they come in all different ones I
get the one for sensitive skin because I
have pretty sensitive skin for facial
lotions I'm going to be doing and
updated skin care routine because I use
all kinds of brands like I'm going to
show you my draw of all my stuff that I
use in that video as well but since
we're talking about drugstore favorites
this also has been one of my favorites
from gonna say five to six years the
clean and clear dual action moisturizer
and I love it because it has sillas oh
my god I'm not even it like this is the
exact same thing that happened the last
time elissa so slick solicit solicit I
think that's how you say it acid which
is known for killing breakouts or
killing your pimples so I love using
this if I have any breakouts I use a few
anti-aging lotions and I'll get more
into that in the next video but if I
ever have a pimple or if I'm noticing my
face is any bit broken out I will switch
to this because I know it does have the
acne medication built into it so
whenever I get on the shower I lather my
whole entire body up with lotion and I
love like thick gooey lotion and there's
a couple different ones that I use but
one that I've always used and I've
always loved for many different reasons
was just the plain ol old school Eucerin
and this one's intensive repair it's
very dry skin lotion and the reason I
love the Eucerin is because a it's
unscented so basically I'm allergic to
so many different scents and so many
different things and I noticed sometimes
when I would get out of the shower if I
shave my legs and I applied a scented
lotion I would get either razor burn I
would get really itchy and it would just
be very very uncomfortable so to avoid
any of
I just usually stick to the Eucerin
because again it's unscented it's really
really sick and it just feels like it's
doing wonders to your skin so this has
been around forever and I don't know I
just I feel like if a company's been
around for that long and they're still
doing well that obviously they're doing
something right so I agree you sir and
you must be doing something right I love
your oh my god I just realized there's
like little teardrops or little
raindrops at the bottom and it tells you
like how thick the lotion is and this
one is the richest so it means it's the
thickest creamy as if you put it on make
your skin all completely white but I
just sit there and rub it in and my skin
feels soft for like two days after if
you guys saw my room to our video on my
second inner beauty Channel I have so
many different nail polishes and I
really really love painting my nails
it's very therapeutic for me but I
actually just recently picked up these
three colors so I recently picked up
these three colors and I wanted to show
you guys they are all Essie oh my god I
keep them all right so these are the
three and my favorite drugstore brands
for Polish are definitely Essie and I
have a lot of the simple colors the
simple colors are like a dollar
ninety-nine so you cannot beat that I
have a whole bunch of those and I love
again the Essie so I just got this
really pretty nude color it's called
Sancho Pez and I love doing just a nude
polish and especially for fall coming up
I know I'm gonna be doing this one a lot
this color was a little bit different
but I loved it it's called Mamba and
it's like this orange e taupe beige
peach all mixed into one and I also
thought this would be a really nice
color for the Fall
and this baby pink color which is just
gorgeous and it's called Fiji and I love
this really really pale pink so I had to
pick that one up as well and it's on the
topic of nails I also love the little
stick ons that you can get sorry the
lights really bright and you can't
really see them but they have these ones
aren't by Maybelline and the Sally
Hansen ones are also really really cool
they come with a little nail file so you
just stick them on like stickers and you
around your nail and they last for like
a week so if you guys don't have any
fake nails on or if you're sick of
getting a manicure that lasts only two
to three days I definitely recommend
trying out the little stickers because
they work really really well so for now
off the top of my head those are my
favorite drugstore products if you guys
enjoyed this video and you like me
explaining different favorite products
of mine let me know because I do go to
the drugstore all the time and I pick up
all kinds of crazy stuff I actually just
got this new brand I never even heard of
it but it's for dark under-eye circles
so I like to pick up things that are
like exciting are new looking and I love
to try them out and I guess it's good
because I'm like your guinea pigs so if
any of you guys see something at the
drugstore that you're absolutely
desperate to buy but you're unsure and
there's no reviews of it definitely
comment and I'll try to read through the
comments and see if I either have tried
