it's been at least a year maybe over a
year since I've done an updated eyebrow
routine I guess a few things really have
changed mostly in the fact that I've
just kind of chilled out a little bit on
the brows I was always over drawing them
a little too much but you live and you
learn you have to go through those
mistakes to realize what you prefer for
your own face when I was in high school
middle school I never ever filled in my
brows so it's like I look back on
pictures and I'm just like you have no
brows like your foundation is covering
your eyebrows like what were you
thinking but I guess it's kind of a
newer thing of the past couple of years
people have just been loving the bolder
darker brows and myself included so I
have literally tried so many brown
products I've tried so many routines and
I've kind of just been stuck with the
same one for about a year now I only use
two products at the moment and I just
have one brush that's really my go-to
brow brush also I just wanted to let you
guys know that I don't get my brows done
currently I haven't gotten my brows
professionally done probably since high
school
I used to get them waxed and threaded um
but like a million other things I'm
allergic to I'm allergic to wax so when
I would get my eyebrows waxed I would
get hives all up here and right in the
middle so luckily I really don't grow
hair in the middle of my brows maybe
sometimes like those little blonde ones
that I'll just kind of pluck out so what
I like to do is just tweeze my eyebrows
at home when they get bad they really
only grow in like right under here and
it's not that much so it's not so hard
to maintain so I just want to let you
guys know for anyone who was maybe
wondering how I shape my brows I kind of
just have had them in the same shape for
a while I just let them grow in and just
kind of clean up underneath and then
sometimes I'll clean up a little bit up
here but that is really it so if you
guys want to see how I currently fill in
my brows and what products I'm using
please keep watching okay so now I'm
moving on to the tutorial part this side
I already filled in and then this side I
didn't do anything to yet so you can
really see right now the difference it's
a lot darker and
just stands out a lot more than the brow
that has nothing in it what I've been
using for the past a year or so is the
Anastasia eyebrow brush this side is an
angle side and then the other side has a
little brush to comb up your eyebrows
and everything like that so this has
been my favorite ever since I got it
it's just a really really good brush has
great bristles and it makes applying
your eyebrow powder super easy the
powder that I've been using for ever now
is the brow bar to go by white and
lightening you can see the middle color
is the one that I've been using I've
gone through probably like eight of
these this is just always been my go-to
brow product I was using the UH Nastasia
brow pomade for a while but I stopped
using it only because sometimes I was
over drawing my brows too much I was
getting them too much of an arch the
pomade really looks like your eyebrows
so if you go a little overboard it's
kind of hard to come back from it so
I've just been preferring the powder
because I've been trying to keep my
eyebrows looking a little bit more
natural and I don't know it's just what
I like at the moment so I'm sure it'll
change any year from now but I'm just
going to be dipping in a little bit of
my brush into the powder and when I mean
a little bit like start with a little
bit and then you can keep adding more so
what I always do first is comb up all of
my hairs on my eyebrow and that's just
to really see where like the shape is
what I like to do first is start at the
bottom and just kind of trace where I
want my eyebrow to be so I'm basically
going to stay with my natural line I'm
just gonna darken it a bit
so now obviously everybody has different
shaped eyebrows different color eyebrows
and different preferences this is just
my routine at the moment um I would say
it's been the same for at least a year
now but it's been a while since my last
I borrow routine and I saw a couple
people asking for an update so when
you're doing the hairs right here I
always like to hold the brush like this
and then just do up and down motions to
kind of make it just look a lot more
natural another thing I always do is I
kind of extend my eyebrow in a little
bit farther than it actually is
and the reason for that is because when
I contour my nose it's going to help
make your nose look slimmer and it's
just going to help blend in the contour
lines
so now I was are never going to be
perfect like ever I mean I always try
but one always looks a little bit
different in pictures and everything
um but this is just really all that I do
and then once I'm finished I'm going to
show you what I do after to keep it
looking nice and fresh and keeping it in
place all day because last thing you
want especially if you're drawing on
your eyebrow a little bit is we don't
want the natural hairs to move down
because then it's just going to make it
look a lot more unnatural you're going
to see the powder the key is to just
really blend it in with your natural
eyebrow and just make it look a little
bit darker
so they look about even right now I
would say again eyebrows our sisters not
twins so what I like to do to hold the
brows in place is currently I'm using
the model and a bottle I brow sealer and
it's just a liquid like this when you
pull out the brush it's going to be so
so I always like to just wipe off the
excess so it's not too much liquid
because you don't really need too much
for your eyebrows and you're just going
to brush the hairs up and in place it's
basically hairspray for your brows I've
used brow gels before and they're
basically the exact same thing I was
using the UH Nastasia clear brow gel
which I loved I just used it up and I
have not replaced it yet I also have one
by Mac it's a brown tint it's okay but I
prefer a clear brow gel or this one
because it's clear as well because
sometimes if you have the colored brow
gel and you apply it and it gets on your
skin it can make it look darker in
certain areas and then all the hard work
was kind of for nothing so what do you
think are they even I know
later when I'm editing it I'll know if
they're even for sure enough but in my
mirror they look bad as even as they're
gonna get and that is really it as far
as how I do my eyebrows I like to keep
it simple I only have three products
will really two products and one brush
that are my key go to products for brows
again everybody is different and
everyone prefers different types of
brows so it's really about trial and
error and playing around with it and
seeing how you guys prefer the most one
thing that I've always found that I do
is sometimes I'll go a little overboard
with things and then a year or so later
I'll look back and I'll be like oh my
gosh it was just too much like natural
is better so I guess that's how a lot of
things aren't like you just got to try
things out for yourself and learn from
your own mistakes to see what really
works best for you but this is my
current routine I just wanted to share
it with you guys
also in case anyone was wondering I'm
wearing
I Carly lash right now and I did a
really simple I look today and I just
want to show you guys that they do look
good with not a crazy amount of makeup
as well but I hope this video helped I
hope you guys enjoyed and until next
time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
