today's video I'm going to talk about
some of my favorite Holy Grail makeup
products I went through and I'm doing
them by category so I'm going to talk
about foundations concealers bronzers
all that good stuff so if you guys want
to hear some of my favorite products at
the moment please keep watching so first
I want to talk about primers I have a
drawer full of primers and I tried
recently switching it up trying
different ones but I found that when I
went back to my original favourites it's
just really no comparison the ones that
I love the best are by Smashbox the pore
minimizer and then the color correcting
so you can see these ones are both like
basically empty uhm I've tried a couple
other pore minimizing primer zand I
don't know I just found that this one
kind of does the job the best so if you
guys have bigger pores or a lot of fine
lines I definitely recommend trying out
this one the color correcting primer um
I don't have a lot of discoloration on
my face the reason that I love this one
is because it went on really really
smoothly it just evened out your skin
tone and prepares your face for all the
makeup that you're about to apply so
primer is so important and I think a lot
of people don't realize the importance
of it the main reason why I love the
primer and why I use the primer is
because what I always do before primer
is I apply lotion on my face so what
that's gonna do is it's going to
moisturize your face and then the primer
is gonna act kind of like a barrier
between your face and the makeup so it's
going to help prevent breakouts it's
going to help prevent um clogged pores
and all that stuff so one thing I always
see people asking is how is your skin
say so nice when you wear so much makeup
and I really do take on the makeup some
days I'm not gonna lie so that's one of
my main tips that I wanted to recommend
for you guys if you have found that your
makeup doesn't last long throughout the
day or you constantly breakout try to
using a good primer and make sure you're
applying it evenly all over your face
and let me know if that solves the trick
so there are a couple others that I do
love but these are just my Holy Grail
must-have favorites so next we're
foundations I have three that I have
just
obsessed with the first one that has
been my favorite for well over a year is
the Chanel perfection Lumiere I have
this one in the color 30 40 and 70 and
those are the three that I can use all
throughout the year these ones are a
little bit pricey but I just love how it
looks on my skin it just gives you that
really soft doll like look on your skin
so this is just been my favorite also
the Chanel colors we're really easy to
match with my skin tone some foundations
can be so confusing because they have
like a gazillion different colors and
you're testing them you're like I don't
know what you want to use but I feel
like the Chanel for my specific skin
tone has a lot of different colors that
really worked for me so this one is
definitely my favorite a new favorite of
mine is the Dior nude skin glowing
makeup I absolutely love this this has
been one of my favorites for about two
or three months now I have this in
number 30 and also number 40 and I just
love how this looks on my skin I've been
this is the one I'm wearing today and
this is the one that's kind of been
replacing the Chanel which is crazy
because Chanel has been my favorite but
I don't know I can't ever give up the
Chanel those two are like my top top two
so I like to justify my top Holy Grail
products as what I'm going to pack with
me when I'm traveling so of course
there's a bunch that I love that I'd
love Sigman with me but there's certain
products I must have with me otherwise I
just feel like empty so the other
foundation that I will always bring with
me if I'm going away as well is the Mac
Studio Fix fluid and I have these in a
bunch of different colors this is the NW
20 and this is the closest to my skin
tone Mac is definitely a lot harder to
match they have a lot of yellow tones
they have a lot of pink tones and then
they have the neutral tones it's kind of
confusing because NW is really cooler
tone and NC is warmer tone which you
would think they do NW would be warm and
NC would be cool but they want to make
it difficult their opposite of the
normal spectrum so you guys are looking
for a really great full coverage
foundation the math one is great but I
recommend going into the store and
having someone
you matched yourself because like I said
the colors can be very confusing and
they look a lot different online than
they do in store so now moving on to
concealers I have a couple that I wanted
to mention um I would have to say my
number one favorite has been the NARS
creamy concealer I have it in custard
and vanilla and yeah I mean they're just
a really good full coverage concealer I
noticed sometimes I'll lay our
concealers to really cover up my dark
circles but this one you really don't
need to liar so I love the NARS creamy
concealer I also love the Tarte
creaseless concealer I have this one in
light and also light/medium and then
another favorite is the Maybelline dark
circle eraser so these three I love when
I'm doing my makeup a certain way it's
really confusing because I'll always
change up how I do my makeup I love
trying new techniques I love switching
around steps just to see like how the
total outcome will come out and these
three I'll always use if I'm doing the
normal prep where I would do primer
foundation and then concealer I have a
concealer that if I do it a little bit
different which I have done in the past
is the Anastasio concealer in 0.75 and
this one I've used and have loved when I
do kind of a different step where I'll
do primer I'll do concealer I'll do the
Korean contour and then I'll blend
everything in with a foundation over it
so when I am doing that step I love
using this concealer because it is very
very full coverage and it's really
creamy and I just absolutely love that
one so these are definitely my four top
Holy Grail concealers they are amazing
they're not sticky they're really creamy
and they cover really well
I wanted to also mention the LA girl Pro
conceal they've recently come out with
an orange shade which I've talked about
in a lot of videos the orange is great
for getting rid of dark circles under
your eyes I will link my dark circle
video on how to get rid of them how to
use the orange concealer so you guys can
go check that out if you have not seen
that yet but they just recently came out
with this one I was using the NYX orange
concealer but that one has been sold out
everywhere so you guys are in the market
for a great orange concealer this one's
incredible and then I also love
beautiful bronze by la girl and
this is I use to contour my face so it
is called a concealer but I use it to
contour and I've been loving that to
contour my nose also if I like to do a
cream contour on my face I've been using
this as well
so these are definitely my top favorites
at the moment while on the subject of
contouring I wanted to also mention my
shade and light palette by Kat Von D
surprisingly this one has been my
absolute favorite it's the one that I
grab every time and the reason for that
is because it has a bronzer and has the
contour shade it has the highlight
shades and I was always using the UH
Nastasia kit and I love those kits that
are amazing as well but this one has
just been the one that I continuously
grab and if I'm doing any of my friends
makeup I'm always using this one it has
such a creamy texture to the powder it's
not too drying and it just glides on
your skin really really nice
so this has been my favorite ever since
it came out so for setting powders my
absolute Holy Grail setting powder at
the moment has been the Laura Mercier
translucent powder this I apply to set
my concealer underneath my eyes one
thing a lot of people don't realize is
you have to set your concealer with a
powder and the reason for that is
because otherwise it's going to slide
around it's not going to stay in place
it's going to go right into the creases
of your eyes and it's just going to look
really messy at the end of the day not
even at the end of the day I feel like
after like an hour even or especially
with the warmer weather if you put on a
concealer and you walk outside it's
going to melt off of your face so using
a setting powder is so important I love
the Laura Mercier one and then also by
Laura Mercier they have the brightening
powder they're both kind of similar I
use both of them and they do the job
really good they're really soft buying
powder so it doesn't take up your face
it's just gonna set whatever you had put
on your face so these are my absolute
favorite at the moment so when I was
going through my blush draw I only
really had one that stood out as like a
Holy Grail blush I'm constantly trying
new ones I'm constantly mixing two
phones together and I just never had one
that really stood out in my mind besides
this one it's by Mac and it's called
petal power it's a mineralized blush and
this is definitely my favorite it's
probably the one that I
use almost every single time it's gonna
kind of give you a nice sheen on your
face so it's going to highlight and give
you some color as well it's just such a
gorgeous shade and I think it looks good
on so many skin tones when my skin tone
is a little bit paler it looks different
as opposed to when I have a little bit
of a tan so it's cool how it kind of
just morphs to match your face also I
love that it's not extremely extremely
pigmented where if you just dip it in
once or twice it's not going to give you
like that big pink blob on your face
it's just going to go on really nice you
just slowly add on and it's going to
give you that perfect color so that's
what I'm wearing today you could see
it's very very subtle but it just gives
you a gorgeous little highlight so to
say so yeah this blush amazing so my
holy grail products for brows the only
brow product that I have used for as
long as I can remember I switched on and
off I tried using the pomades for a
little bit not my thing
the brow bar to go and this is in the
darker shade by whitening lightening is
my favorite it's the only one that I use
it has such a great pigmentation to it
and it just makes my eyebrows look super
natural I noticed when I was trying
other products they either ended up
being too sick or they just didn't look
good so this has been my absolute
favorite I recommend this to everybody
anytime someone comes over I give them
one because I have a couple extras so
this is incredible my number one
favorite also while we're on the subject
of brows I have my model in a bottle
long-lasting eyebrow sealer I mentioned
this in another favourites video I
believe but it just kind of holds your
eyebrows in place so that is absolutely
my favorite I haven't been using a brow
gel in a while I've just been sticking
with that so I absolutely love that
product it's again it's basically like
hairspray for your eyebrows if you are
filling in your brows a lot darker than
maybe your natural brow is use a sealer
like this because it'll help keep your
brows up and it'll help make your
eyebrows look super natural I also
really quickly wanted to mention this
eyelash glue that I've been using this
is my second bottle that I went through
it's by kiss and it's the strip lash
adhesive you can get it right at your
drugstore and the reason that I like
this over the little squirty ones is
because it has like a wand so you just
dip it in and then you paint on your
eyelash with this part which has been so
convenient
because whenever I would buy the other
little like the little white jars not
only would I lose the cap within like
days but it would always dry up and then
I have to like like squeeze it really
really hard to get any glue out and I
can't even tell you how many times I
tried squeezing it to get that dry glue
out and then it just exploded everywhere
it ruined one of my shirts it got on my
carpet is just such a hassle so once I
found this my life had changed and I
want to share that with you guys because
I don't ever really mention eyelash glue
in any of my videos so so of course I
have to mention this little guy this is
my Beauty Blender um I have a bunch of
these I just love beauty blenders um you
guys probably see me use them in a bunch
of videos it's to bled out your makeup
it's to smooth things another thing that
I use it for is once I'm finished with
my whole look and I spray fix+ all over
my face I've just dabbed this everywhere
and it just seamlessly blends everything
together so you guys don't have a Beauty
Blender I recommend getting them it has
literally changed my life and made
applying makeup so much easier so of
course I had to include that today I've
also seen a lot of people asking me to
do a video talking about some of my
favorite brushes I haven't done a video
like that in over two years and a lot
has changed so comment below if you guys
do want to see a video about my favorite
brushes and which brushes I recommend
having in your kit because I don't want
to include that today because I figured
if you want to see that I'll do that in
a separate video so I don't much to say
about this I just wanted you guys to
know that L'Oreal telescopic you guys
know the deal about this mascara the
only one that I've used for as long as I
can remember it's my Holy Grail mascara
haven't been one better to hear my chair
like every time I move a certain way
I've had to share for like four years I
think it's time to either grease it up
or get a new one um okay so moving on
facial sprays Mac just came out with new
fix+ colors flavors whatever you want to
call them this one is coconut and it is
heavenly you guys have heard me talk
about the Mario Badescu rose water spray
you know how much I love to
right but I've always been such a fan of
fix+ now that they came out with the
different flavors I've just been like oh
I bought four different flavors I got
the coconut the rosewater the lavender
and cucumber so I started with the
coconut in this the one that I've been
using and I absolutely love it it's
definitely worth it if you guys don't
have fix+ you need it in your life one
of the main reasons that I love this is
whenever I finish applying my makeup
like all the powders everything I do a
couple sprays all over my face and I
don't know how it does it but I swear it
just kind of like brings everything
together so if your makeups looking like
a little bit edgy or you're seeing where
one's one part starting and the other
parts ending spray it all over your face
and just somehow just like brings
everything together so mac fix+ and
coconut is absolutely delicious
depending on which flavor you like go
into the store smell them because it's
this new thing and they're amazing so
next I want to talk about some
highlighters this part was definitely
the hardest because I have so many
favorite highlighters like so many um
but the ones that stood out that I've
used the most I wanted to mention I
guess just some of the ones that I've
recently been loving that are just kind
of must-haves um the first one is Becca
opal this one has just been probably one
of my most used it's such a gorgeous
champagne color the next one is actually
a new product that I got maybe a month
or two ago
it's the Laura Geller gilded honey
highlighter and this is an exact dupe of
whisper gilt so I was gonna mention
whisper of guilt but no one can get
their hands on it anymore and no one
wants to spend $200 on eBay for it so
this one gilded honey is gorgeous and
it's so pigmented and it's amazing it
gives you a gorgeous golden look so this
one also another dupe for whisper Gill
is the Kiko 208 i shadow and I mentioned
that over here ago for you guys but I
went recently into the Kiko store and
they were completely sold out of it so I
think a lot of people realize that it's
a complete dupe and it's sold out in the
store in Jersey so if you guys find it
anywhere
again another dupe of Matt whisper of
guilt which is going to give you that
golden goddess look so the next one has
been around literally forever but I
don't think a lot of people give it
credit anymore the Mac soft and gentle
this one is just so gorgeous it's so
pigmented and it gives you that gorgeous
champagne glow um I used to use this one
all the time and I stopped for a while
and then I recently picked it up again
and I was like why did I stop using this
and sometimes when there's a million new
products coming out you want to try all
different things and you forget about
your original favorites but this was
definitely one of my original favorite
highlighter so neck soft and gentle it's
a permanent one so it's not going
anywhere for those of you guys want to
try it so for now that is going to be it
for my Holy Grail makeup products I did
leave out lip products as well as
brushes because I figured maybe I can
use those videos separate if I would sit
down here and talk about some of my
favorite lip products I would be here
for probably about a half hour 45
minutes because there's just so many
that I love for different reasons
so again comment below if you guys want
to see maybe like a Holy Grail brush
video or a Holy Grail lipstick video I
could do something like that in the
future but I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope this helped for some of you
guys may be in the market for a specific
product if there are any products that I
mentioned that you guys have more
questions about um definitely you
comment below and I will try my best to
get through and answer whatever
questions that you guys have I didn't
want this video to be like an hour long
so I try to keep it pretty minimal as to
why they were my favorites but again if
you guys have any questions whatsoever I
will try my best to get through and
answer them for you guys so I hope you
enjoyed and until next time I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
