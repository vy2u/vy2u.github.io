I'll never know
what makes this mag with all the love hi
everyone thank you for watching so a lot
of you have been emailing me and
messaging me asking me what are my
favorite beauty products and what are my
favorite foundations and all kinds of
stuff so I wanted to put together this
video it's a little bit different than I
guess anything I've done I'm gonna be
doing my top beauty products for 2012
when it comes to beauty products I'm
always looking for something new
something better or something that I'll
just make my life easier so I just
wanted to mention a couple of the
products that I use in 2012 and I would
not have been able to survive well I
mean I would have been able to survive
but I mean it wouldn't have been the
same without them they really do make
such a difference and I wanted to just
go through a couple of them with you and
show you guys what I love this year and
hopefully you enjoyed them singles so if
you want to learn please keep watching
so the first thing I'm gonna be talking
about is this foundation by L'Oreal True
Match Lumi and my color is w 6 which is
sun beige and this foundation I've been
using for about 4 months now and I've
been so happy with it I love drugstore
foundation that has just always been my
go-to because I like trying different
things to try what I like the best and
they're more affordable so for me I
would try all kinds and I did have a few
favorites but this one by far is my new
favorites so L'Oreal True Match Lumi you
can get this Target Walmart Walgreens
anything like that I would say this is
medium coverage and it goes on very
nicely I just use it with a foundation
brush and it covers any imperfections
any flaws and it really matches my skin
tone perfectly the next thing I'm going
to be talking about I've never mentioned
before I don't know why but I've been
using these forever
they're called smooth away it's a way to
remove your hair and it's kind of like
sandy
I'm gonna open it and show you so it
comes in two different sizes it comes
with the small one like this and then a
large one which I can't find the pants
them right now but this is it comes with
this pink thing and what you do is it's
a sticker one sides like sandpaper if
you can kind of tell I don't know and
you just stick it on to there and then
what you do is I don't use this for my
whole body it says you can use it for
your arms or your legs but I just use it
instead of waxing because I'm allergic
to wax so if I got my lip wax or if I
used to get like above my eyebrows or in
between my eyebrows wax
I would always get hives so I just would
never do it so I mean it started getting
a little out of line and I didn't know
what to do because you never want to use
a razor because then it's gonna make
your hair grow back thicker so I came
across these at Walgreens and they were
in the as seen on TV section I believe
they have them at Harmons which is
another store kind of like Walgreens and
I tried it out and this is probably two
years ago and I've been really happy
with it
it probably lasts about 3-4 days and
it's painless all you do is you put it
on your finger because it has the little
thing and then you just do small
circular motions you do I do three one
wide and three with the other way and
then three the other way again and then
it removes your hair so I recommended
this to my aunt actually and she tried
it and for some weird reason it didn't
work on her and I even tried to do it on
her and I don't know if it's if she got
a bad batch or what but I just didn't
work on her skin so I do recommend this
because it is affordable so if you did
want to try it out it really does work
amazing for me but keep in mind that
again she it didn't work for her so if
it doesn't work this is me warning you
that it may not work but for me I've
used it for two years and it's
definitely a safe easy effective way to
get rid of unwanted facial hair so again
smooth away the next thing that I want
to talk about is my Smashbox
photo-finish color correcting primer
which looks like this
I got this about four maybe five months
ago and I absolutely loved it
I never really tried Smashbox before I
did this photo event with them and when
I did I had tried this and the reason I
love this is because it's a salmon color
and it is a color corrector if you have
any like redness or dark spots on your
face you will see how quickly it just
kind of covers your face and makes it
like completely matte and like all one
color to prep your foundation I 100%
recommend this to anybody who's in need
of a good primer I use this on brides
when I do wedding so I definitely
recommend this again Smashbox they have
about eight different kinds of
foundation primers so you can try a
different one a good seems better for
your skin like I know I have one that's
oil-free that's good for oily skin but
this one is by far my favorite speaking
of color correcting 2012 I learned so
many different color correcting
techniques and it's something so simple
that any of you can do you can go to a
drugstore and it really really helps the
one thing that I recommend if you have a
lot of redness is by L'Oreal and it is
an anti redness primer and it's green
most of you would see something green
and be like okay well this looks
absolutely nothing like my skin tone I
am NOT gonna be buying this and that's
what I think I would be like why do they
have green and yellow and white
concealers like it just didn't make
sense to me but this really if you mix
it with either your foundation primer or
your foundation your skin the redness
will disappear so I love this one by
L'Oreal they also have the Maybelline
stick which is the green color as well
if you have dark circles under your eyes
I recommend a salmon color concealer
which I used in my contour and highlight
video this one is called radiant and
this is my second one I went through
these really quickly I love it because
it's perfect for under your eyes and it
really does do what it's supposed to do
so try out different colors you'd be
surprised and the last color is the
yellow one which I also used in my
contour video it's by Mac prep and prime
and it's they you like boost and I'm
gonna show you what it looks like
looks like this and you twist it and
then it comes out the top so the yellow
color is good to brighten up under your
eyes and also get rid of any dark spots
2012 also introduced me to Laura Mercier
a concealer which is this one and it's
the secret camouflage concealer mine is
in s3 and this literally saved my life
best concealer in the world I start
before this I used to put like layer
after layer of concealer and I swear I
just never gave me that nice smooth
under-eye look and it would always
crease and I guess because this one's a
little bit trickier than the more creamy
ones that I have I don't know what it is
but it's perfect love it recommend it to
everybody everyone who has used it that
I recommended the to do love it so
definitely check that out you can get it
at Sephora another thing that's really
important is when you're using a
concealer is to set it because since it
does have that stickiness to it if you
don't set it with loose powder or any
kind of powder it will smudge and you'll
get those like lines under your eyes and
also you can get like those black dots
from your mascara so one thing I bought
I'm say maybe 5 months ago I'm not even
sure is the banana powder by Ben Nye and
I mean if you read the front I had
posted a picture of this and I guess
there's a lot of things in here that's
not good for your skin
then my makeup is used on like Broadway
and in movies and it's good for bright
lighting so I mean if you want it in
everyday powder maybe the Ben Knight
isn't for you but if you are a makeup
artist and you're looking for a good
powder the banana powder is amazing and
it also has the yellow tint to it so
it's gonna really brighten up under your
eyes if you don't want to try the Ben
Nye out and you are looking for another
type of loose powder
I recommend by Maybelline it is mineral
power finishing veil and it's
translucent and you can again get this
at any drugstore and it's a good
duplicate the only difference is it
doesn't have a color to it and I don't
know I like the Ben Nye better just last
longer but again
try both of them one thing I actually
have not talked about yet that I
absolutely love is model in a bottle so
it's kind of similar to the fixed plus
and the Urban Decay all night saying
spray that I have but this one I don't
know it just really makes my skin glow
and it really holds the makeup and I
tried the new sensitive skin formula
recently and I'm so happy with it so you
guys should definitely try it if you are
a dancer or if you're planning on going
out for like a long night you're gonna
be dancing and sweating and you don't
want your makeup to move this is really
gonna help you and it's perfect to use
for your face so Matt a little bottle
you can get this on Amazon they have a
sensitive skin formula and the original
formula and I believe they have smaller
bottles if you want to try it out before
you buy the bigger bottle but I think
this was only $14 so try it out so if
you've watched any of my makeup videos
and you follow me you know my only
mascara is L'Oreal telescopic so I just
included this in my favorites for 2012
because this is hands-down the only
mascara I will use I was actually out of
it and had to buy a new one and
yesterday I went to put on a different
kind of mascara and I just I couldn't I
couldn't do it I didn't like how it
looked so I had to go out and buy it but
L'Oreal telescopic for those of you who
are wondering this is what the packaging
does look like and it's really cool
because they always have like buy one
get one half off sales for the this type
of mascara so whenever they do that I
always stock up but I love this mascara
another thing that I discovered this
year are Jordana eyeliner and lip liners
and these are from Walgreens and I was
never really big into lip liner until I
got a few from Mac and I was like okay
well they're nice and they maybe give it
a little bit of a difference but like
I'm not gonna spend thirty forty dollars
on a lip liner I'm just gonna use a
lipstick and they'll be fine but when I
found these they were 199 or $2.99 or
even $0.99 I'm not sure but they're so
cheap so I was like okay well lip liners
eyeliners why not try them out and if
they were good then I found a great deal
and they did and
hello look ammonia can you tell I like
this brand but yeah again they're so
cheap so if you want to try different
colors out it's fun to find a cheap
alternative so you can try more colors
without spending a lot of money but my
favorite is tawny and this one is the
most neutral color but I mean Tony I
have Cabernet Silver lilac and plush
plum and then I have blues greens purple
eyeliners just wanted to try some
different colors out a couple months
back I had posted an updated eyebrow
tutorial and I mentioned the brow bar to
go it has the dark brown it has the
lighter brown and then it has like the
eyebrow gel and this is for your
eyebrows and the reason I'm mentioning
this again is I never realized how much
I used it and the reason for that is if
I'm in a rush and I'm trying to throw
myself together really quickly this I
use the brown for my eyebrows I use it
to contour I put it on my cheeks on the
sides of my nose and like up here use
that dark brown and then the lighter
brown I use with the big blending brush
and I just put it right in my crease and
that's gonna just give it a little shout
on my crease I'll throw on mascara and
I'm basically done so it's really cool
if you're in a rush or if you don't have
a lot of space it can be used for your
eyebrows for contouring and also for
eyeshadows it's really cool because I do
have the discount on it so it is
inexpensive and it is small so it's
perfect to carry with you and again was
one of my favorites in 2012 I've know
I've mentioned this bronze or in a
couple videos but this one is also my
only bronzer I use by L'Oreal it's a
true match and mine is cocoa and I
actually got a few email saying while I
went out and I tried it and I looked
like a clown because it comes out orange
on my face well you have to remember if
you have paler skin than I do get a
lighter shade because this was a darker
shade that comes but I have tanner skin
so on me it works perfectly but if you
have fair skin I would go up just a
couple shades darker so I mean I don't
even know how many days darker this is
but maybe like four or five then my skin
tone and that's gonna give you a nice
bronze look I'm going to talk about the
three last items to get
because they are my facial products this
face watch has been with me all of 2012
and I've been a big fan of it one time I
did run out of it and they didn't have
it in the store so I had tried a few
other things and I was happy but I
noticed I started getting a few more
pimples when I wasn't using this one
which I haven't really dealt with
pimples in a while and I realized that
it must have been from this because it
does have that scrubber on the top of it
so it does clean really deep and it is
from the drugstore so you can get it for
I think under $10 mine is for
combination skin and I really really do
recommend it I was as my sixth or
seventh one and I've always been really
happy with it
another thing since I had just mentioned
how I did get a few pimples when I
wasn't using it I am sure everyone has
heard of oxy pads just plain old oxy
pads they've been selling them for years
and years and years gravity so I can't
against me and gravity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
