I'm finally back then like a video I
feel like it's been way too long since I
have done so it's been a really hectic
couple of weeks so I do apologize I
think this has been the longest that
I've ever gone without filming and I'm
not happy about it so today I'm back
with a video that I've seen requested
for quite some time now I'm going to be
talking about my Holy Grail makeup
brushes the ones that I use on a
day-to-day basis also the ones that I'm
constantly bringing with me if I leave
the house or if I'm traveling on
vacation so I figured I would just take
you through every single brush that I
use that I feel like you would need in
your kit if you are an artist or if you
are really into makeup buying the right
brushes can really change how your
makeup comes out so I figured I would
give you guys some tips along with what
I use each brush for that way if you
guys are trying to build up your brush
kit you can see which ones I use why I
use them and if it's something that
you've been looking for hopefully this
video will help so I'm going to go
through all of my brushes from face to
eyes to body to all that so if you guys
want to hear what they are please keep
watching so before I get into brushes
I'm going to talk about two tools that
aren't technically brushes that I use
all the time the first one is the Beauty
Blender the damn Beauty Blender um this
is my absolute favorite makeup tool I
use it to apply foundation I use it to
blend out my concealer I use it to kind
of blend everything together it's really
my most used makeup tool they come in a
bunch of different colors so I saw a
couple people asking why mine was black
and it wasn't pink if you go on their
website or Sephora you could see what
the different ones are for I do have the
purple pink white and black one
they say the black one is like the Pro
Beauty Blender um to be honest I don't
really see a difference between any of
them but I just love this tool one thing
that I always used to do when I first
got this and why I wasn't liking it was
I would never get it wet so I didn't
realize that you had to get it wet
squeeze it out make sure it was super
damp and that's how you use a tool it
gets about double in size so that's one
thing I wanted to mention I'm sure most
of you guys know that already but there
are I'm sure some of you out there that
I've tried
you blender and you're like I don't
understand what all the fuss is about so
that was kind of how I felt but now that
I know how to use it right it's
definitely my most used tool so it is a
little pricey for a sponge but it's
something that every pro celebrity
artist is using this beauty blender is
life also I have the Beauty Blender
cleaner because I wasn't able to clean
it with any other um mixture so if you
guys found something that cleans the
Beauty Blender that's maybe more
affordable than the actual cleaner let
me know because like I said I have tried
a build jillion different things and it
still would never get the foundation or
concealer out so I think this is worth
every penny and this is my most used
tool the next product is a powder puff I
actually picked this one up from Namie's
when I was in LA last weekend and this
is just a regular little puff you can
get them really anywhere this I use to
apply powder underneath my eyes and also
right around my cheekbone one thing that
I was always doing wrong and I actually
asked a few people and they gave me some
tips was when I would sometimes it would
work but sometimes when I would set my
concealer with loose powder it would get
all those little dots under my eyes and
that is really like my least favorite
thing of life so the technique that I
found works the best is if you dip it
into the powder I like to empty up the
powder into the palm of my hand take the
puff dip it in and then you very very
very lightly go over wherever you want
to set the powder so the key is the
press super super light you don't want
to pound the powder into your skin and
that's what I found worked best for me
if you guys have tried this technique
and you still can't figure it out try
doing it really really soft or if that
doesn't work maybe try applying a little
bit harder it just really depends on
your skin tone if your skin is dry if
your skin is oily so this is something
that I use all the time I think it was
like $2 so they're really affordable you
could buy them at the drugstore wherever
you can get your hands on one just a
regular old powder puff so believe it or
not these are my favorite brushes I have
so many more that I'm not including but
these are my top top must-have favorite
so it might seem like a lot but I'm
going to go through and explain which
brush does what what each one is for so
that way you guys don't need to go out
and buy every single one you can see
maybe which tool would work best for you
so they're not really in any order I
kind of just place
these little holders so they're
organized so I'm just going to go
through each one let's start with this
brush right here this is my Sigma
Foundation F 60 brush this brush I use
not every single time I apply my makeup
but basically whenever I feel like my
skin tone is a little bit of a different
color than what I'm used to I will like
to paint on my foundation to make sure
that it matches my body so for instance
if I have a spray tan and I need to go a
lot darker I will paint on the
foundation with this brush making sure
that it matches my chest I will drag it
on down and then I'll grab my damp damp
Beauty Blender and blend it all in
so this brush I think isn't a hundred
percent of necessity but if you guys are
a freelance artist and you're constantly
doing other people's makeup I think this
technique would work really well with
this brush so again what you would do is
sometimes you have to mix foundation so
you're going to mix them on the back
your hand pick it up with this brush and
then slowly paint it onto your face and
your neck to make sure that it matches
your chest so that way before you blend
everything in you can let it oxidize on
your face make sure it matches and then
blend it in so again I would recommend
this tool if you guys are a pro artist
if you are just doing your own makeup at
home I would say maybe you could skip
out on this one so the next brush is
also a foundation brush this is my Sigma
flat kabuki f80 brush and the reason I
know that some of these are my favorites
is I have like duplicates in my little
bucket that I carry around because when
one's dirty I go for the clean one so
this one I have like two or three up in
my actual kit that I bring with me to
travel this is my foundation brush it's
one of my absolute favorite brushes if
I'm not using my Beauty Blender and make
sure foundation go on so smoothly and I
just absolutely love this one you just
do some buffing motions to rub it in and
I usually do like circular buffing
motions and this has just been my
absolute favorite it's good for your
neck it's good for your face it's good
if you're going to apply some like
shimmer on your body so this again is
the f80 brush amazing foundation brush
let me go to the other foundation brush
just to compare I think I really only
have one other one that's considered
like a foundation
rush this one right here is the duo
fiber powder blush f15 brush so they're
saying this is for blush but you can use
it for foundation or blush really
anything creamy I actually use this
brush to apply body bling on to my body
today so it's just a really really great
foundation brush I love the ones with
the duo fibers because it's really soft
on your face and it provides really even
coverage so at the moment these two are
definitely my top foundation brush but
again majority of the time if I'm not
using these I'm using my Beauty Blender
so if you guys want to splurge on the
Beauty Blender I would say go for that
over these two brushes
the next brush is this one right here
this is the Mac 130 brush I had this
version in the morphe brush they have
the almost exact same one which I was
using all the time and I actually
misplaced it so I just had to grab my
Mac one the morphe brushes are a lot
cheaper so I will link the exact one for
you guys if you are looking to try this
one out if you guys don't have the Mac
Pro discount card
I will definitely list Mac alternatives
that are a little bit cheaper that I
constantly use on a daily basis I just
couldn't find them for this video so
this brush right here is also a dual
fiber brush i like to use this for a
couple different things so what I use it
for today was when I applied my
highlighter not my concealer my
highlighter and like that downwards
triangle on my face I use that to push
the product into my face I also use it
to blend out the contours on my face so
this is the only one of my most used
brushes for blending out cream highlight
and contour again I have the morphe one
that I've been using and it's just as
good as the Mac one I just literally
looked around everywhere and I don't
know if I left it in my suitcase or
where it is but yes so again I will list
numbers to cheaper alternatives below
the next brush I have is the Mac 287
concealer brush another dual fibre brush
this one I use to apply my concealer so
today what I did is I pumped my
concealer on the back of my hand I
picked up a little bit of it and like a
tapping motion and then you just apply
it underneath your eyes I use this one
almost every single day to apply my
concealer so what I'll do is I will
apply it with that I'll let it say
and let it dry a little bit so it blends
really nicely and then I'll take my damn
Beauty Blender and kind of blend it out
so for concealers this and this one are
my favorite I also have one more
concealer brush where this one is the
Sigma II 50
this one I will use if I'm using a
thicker concealer for instance whenever
I use my honest Asya concealer since it
isn't a little pan and it's thicker I
just dip that right in and then I draw
wherever I want it onto my face so I
would say between these two brushes I
use the Mac one probably more because
I'm always constantly using maybe a more
thinner concealer but whenever I want to
do that full coverage look and really
like scoop that concealer I use this one
the e58 so these are my two concealer
brushes the next brush I want to talk
about is the Sigma soft blend concealer
brush in F 64 what I use this for is
once I apply my loose powder underneath
my eyes and also over here and I let it
bake for a little bit I swipe away all
of the loose powder with this brush just
because it's very very soft and smooth
and it's actually one of their newer
brushes I believe but it just kind of
gets up all the excess powder without
ruining all the work that you did and
it's going to help prevent any of those
little dots on your eyes so this one I
would say you don't need it you can use
any fluffy brush to wipe it away but
it's just one that I'm constantly using
so I just wanted to share it with you
guys
the next brush is my fan brush this
one's my artist Couture this was um the
one that came out with Mac Daddy's
diamond powder and I use this one all
the time for the highlight on my cheek
so I just very lightly will dust on
highlight with this brush and I like the
fan brushes for this because it kind of
just puts the product right in the
correct spot um another thing that I
will do to apply highlight is I'll just
kind of use my finger and then do small
circular motions so again the fan brush
I don't think it's like a necessity I
only started using this brush maybe like
a year ago before then I would again
either use my fingers or you can even
use like a fluffy eyeshadow brush which
I'll show you guys in a couple of
minutes as long as there's no dark
shadow on it of course so this one I
don't think is a hundred percent you
need it but again if you guys are
looking for a good fan brush this is
just the one that I always tend to use
so for blush I am always using my Mac
129 brush this I like to apply bronzer
with blush with and not going to lie the
bristles on this one are a little bit
harsh so recently I've been using this
one by morphe it's a lot softer like so
much softer and it works just as good
and it's about half the price this is
the morphe mb2 brush so you can see
they're pretty similar in shape again
this morphe one is just so it's like
velvety soft and then the Mac one I
don't know if it's because it's really
old but it's starting to feel like a
little bit harsh on my face so when I
apply it I can actually feel it again
these two are very very similar so if
you are looking for something and you're
on a budget I definitely recommend this
one it's amazing or if you are looking
maybe for a little bit of a higher-end
brush this Mac one is great to this next
brush I use literally every day my
must-haves can't live without brush this
is the Sigma large fluffy 50 brush this
is brush I use to apply the powder
underneath my eyes so I'm not talking
about the loose powder this is more of
my compact powder whether it's the
Studio Fix the Revlon I have a NYX
version I have a couple different brands
that I like they are basically the
foundation powder I like to dip my brush
in it and then Pat it underneath my eyes
so this one I use literally every single
day Mac has an exact same one which is
the 227 but I prefer the Sigma one
they're really exactly the same no they
do the same job my Mac one is just a
little bit older so I tend to stick with
the Sigma one um my Sigma one's nice and
clean this one's a little bit dirty but
yeah so you can see they're just little
tiny fluffy brushes and gives you a lot
of control and it picks up a lot of
product when you're using it so these I
feel like our must have if you want to
erase the dark circles on your eyes I
have a video which I'll link right here
for you guys where I talk about how to
erase dark circles and I show you how I
use this brush in action so definitely
check out that video see how I use it
and then you can see that's something
you're into and if it's a brush that you
guys definitely need again some people
don't like to apply the foundation
powder
their eyes so if you don't then skip
that brush you don't need it I don't use
it for anything else so the next brush I
wanted to mention it's not something
that I've been currently using but it
was a favorite like a month or two ago
morphe n170 brush and this is a perfect
perfect brush to contour your nose if
any of you guys are looking for a good
brush but again like I said I haven't
been using it because I use the la girl
concealer if you guys are looking for a
really good nose contour color or just a
contour color in general that one is
super super affordable and I absolutely
love it so I just wanted to mention this
for any of you guys may be looking for a
brush and are unable to find it I'm
going to list my video right here for
anyone who wants to see this brush in
action on how I use it to contour my
nose
the next brush is my eyebrow brush ever
since I posted my eyebrow tutorial I
actually recently found a new favorite I
was using the Anastasia brush which is
amazing but this little end of it fell
off so I actually picked up this one
it's called build a brow by it cosmetics
and this one is amazing it's so weird
because sometimes I'll use like a
different eye brow brush and my eyebrows
will just be uneven no matter how much I
try so I just think something about the
thickness of this angled brush just
makes my eyebrows look perfect and it
also has the comb to brush up your
eyebrows which is awesome so this one is
just my absolute favorite at the moment
you can get this at like sephora or Ulta
I think Sephora has it cosmetics I'm not
100% positive but I will link it for you
guys
there is no oh it says number 12 brush
so this is my favorite and then last but
not least I have five eyeshadow brushes
that these are the only brushes that I
need if I were doing my eyeshadow these
are the ones that I use to start off I
have my it's actually a concealer brush
F F yeah F 70 and I just use this one as
an eyeshadow brush it's like the perfect
shape and it holds a lot of pigment on
it a lot of times what I'll do is I'll
dip my brush into fix+ or even like
water and that'll help really really
bring out the pigment so this one is
definitely my most used as far as
applying anything all over the lid also
in my tear duct and I'm
he's my brow the next one is the Sigma
e-40 brush this is the large tapered
eyeshadow brush and I use this to apply
any color into my crease this one's
super large and fluffy so I like to
apply like lighter shades with this
brush so say I'm doing a brown smokey
eye I will take a neutral colored Brown
apply it very loosely into my crease and
it'll give it that transition shade that
you guys wanted so this one's amazing if
you guys want more precision I have the
e25 brush which is just a little bit of
a smaller blending brush and this again
is going to give you more precision so I
applied my darker shades like the outer
V right with this brush and then you
just slowly blend it into the transition
shade above it which you can keep once
you apply something with this brush you
can go back to the fluffy one and then
just blend everything together so these
two are like a hundred percent must-have
in your kit the next one is my Mac
pencil brush 219 Sigma makes an exact
dupe of this I thought I grabbed the
Sigma one but they're exactly the same
this I like to use to apply shadows
underneath my eyes this one is
definitely my favorite I use it all the
time if you guys don't want to splurge
on an extra brush you can always use the
original the first brush that I showed
you dip it in whatever shadow and then
just very lightly apply underneath your
eyes so pencil brush not going to say a
hundred million percent need it but I
think if you guys are looking for a good
kit that you guys should get this one
I'm not sure if Sigma still does the
full kits I don't know if it was like a
holiday edition but they have like a
full kit and it has basically all the
ones that I'm talking about in it so
I'll look on the website for you guys I
don't know if it was limited edition and
then my last brush is my small tapered
blending brush II 45 and it has a little
bit of a pointed tip this one I use for
a couple of different things I use it to
set my nose contour so I will apply like
a darker brown shade and just lightly
contour over where I contoured with the
cream contour what I also use this for
is for my for the outer V of my eye to
blend it in if I'm using like a black
shade I'll use this one because it's
very very precise so if you just get it
on the tip of it it'll only go where you
want it to go so this is the last brush
that I wanted to talk about with you
guys
I'm going to talk about really quickly
also how I clean my brushes I recently
picked up how annoying is my chair I
recently picked up you could tell I only
use it a few times the cinema secrets
makeup brush cleaner and it's quick
drying and rinse free I don't know
what's in it to make it do that but it
actually really really works I pour a
little bit onto my brush and then I just
swirl it on my little washcloth and then
it comes right off and then it dries
really quick so this stuff's amazing
they sell it in a lot smaller of
containers if you guys want to try it
out but this is the one that I've been
using for just like quick little fixes
once every two to three weeks
I fully deep clean my brushes and what I
do is I mix vegetable oil along with
dish soap so I use antibacterial dish
soap the one that has like the little
penguin on it you want to make sure
whatever you're using has anti bacterial
in it it's gonna kill all the bacteria
so I do like two-thirds soap and then I
do one third of the oil and then you
just swirl your brush mix it around to
get both the soap and the oil on it and
then I just rinse it out I also wanted
to show you the two things that I use to
clean my brushes I don't think these are
like a hundred percent you got to run
out and buy these but if you're always
using your makeup brushes and you're
constantly cleaning them with my
technique or whatever technique that you
use first the one that I always use
which I kind of have a replacement now
is the Sigma glove they come double
sided so it's one side is for face one
side is for eyes and it just has like
little ridges all over them and what you
do is you could just put this on what I
always do is I put on a paper plate the
olive oil and the dish soap mix my brush
together and then under the faucet I'll
just go like this and I'll clean it on
this brush and then you just right in
between here let me show you for
instance right in between here you go
like this you wring it out and then I
set them down on like a washcloth to dry
so that is just what I use they also
have a new little thing I don't know how
new it is but it's like the matte this
part goes right in around your drain and
then it's
putting the glove on you can just brush
the brushes on this rinse them out and
then let them dry so again I don't think
you guys 100% need them but if you are
constantly washing your brushes and you
hate getting a really dry palm I
definitely recommend them I'm not sure
how much they go for but one thing that
I was always doing and I noticed is when
you use the soap on your hands and
you're cleaning your brush like this
it's gonna give you like dry sometimes
like not scaly with that sounds gross
like dry skin sometimes look at dry skin
it'll dry out your hands by doing it
that way so it just really depends on
preference if you are doing it a lot
then maybe invest in one of those but if
not you don't need it I just wanted to
show to you guys because I do use it
when I do deep clean my brushes and I
think that's really it as far as brushes
again there was a few that I mentioned
that I don't think are must-haves for
everybody but if you guys are freelance
artists or makeup artist in general I
think a lot of the brushes that I showed
you are necessities in a kit especially
if you're doing a lot of people's other
makeup so that is it as far as brushes I
don't want to keep you any longer or
bore you any longer but I will be
filming again tomorrow I'm thinking
about doing like a get ready with me
video chitchat and just to kind of
update you on everything that's been
going on so let me know if you guys want
