really sleep like lying down yes I sleep

her in second grade she moved up no I
think she moved out don't move down one
time I had her but she was literally one
of my favorite teachers ever it sounds a
little bit weird but the time like at

that's how I like weave that picture of
us as like a little couple like me with
my arm around her it's because of this

story because it's like something I'll
never forget her sister was sleeping
over my house and Nicole came to pick

the doorbell and I was literally in my
pajamas with like my afro hair and I
answered the door and she was like hi

where was your first sleepover my mom is
actually one of the cooler moms like I
noticed growing up a lot of my friends
moms were always so strict about having
sleepovers and stuff my mom was always
like as long as they come into my house
I don't care so I had a third grade C
bovver birthday party everybody yeah
yeah it was crazy we turn up like little
freaking wild and wild animals I
remember we stayed up all night I
watched I made them watch Fast Times at
Ridgemont High if you've ever seen it

mean I've had some overs with my
cousin's you know yeah thank you mom for
like I'm gonna do that you're LR mom
Barbies did you call mom I think other
moms like looked at her like she's a
crazy bitch yeah and just likes to have
all these kids at her house but I feel
like I'm gonna be that mom my brother
everyone in our house my dad was always
like pissed that we were planning a lawn
because he liked to maintain the yard
and everything keep it all nice and
fresh look and all that
so he always came home or wherever we
saw him coming from the distance we
think I'll run inside or something so I
feel like I'm gonna be like that like
get on but I'm not going to be mean but
wouldn't you rather everyone like the
kids at your house II can when the
hiking very each like I don't even want
them drinking but yes but when they're
young and annoying and wanted like do
things and have you take them everywhere
no go to your friend's house have been
worried about you say that now yeah my
first ever sleepover um that's honestly
really hard it's either a tie between my
old next-door neighbors the young
Brittany who were my best friends and I
was there every day it was either that
or my friend Ashley Franklin we were
friends since like preschool and I used
to sleep over there every day and we
used to pretend to be Mary Kate Nash
considering what no not like me everyone
thought we kind of looked alike her name
was Ashley so I was mary-kate and we
said dress and like I'd be in pink and
she'd be an exact outfit in blue we go
everywhere together in the same outfits
and just lines they were twins so it was
either her speaking of first best
friends like they may have been my first
best friends before and who was the
first person you talked to you today I
don't know maybe you it's not a great
question arose well I didn't make up the
question so what was the first thing you
did this morning go to bathroom did you
poop no it was the first thing I did
this morning woke up 12 times to go back
to sleep and then cuddled came on and
cuddle with you because it's so sad like
I can't can't even like hug him I'm so
used to just like always being like need
to swinging I'm not like wearing it on
purpose but when I'm sitting or in an
upright position I need to have it in
this type of just for the first week cuz
I got this on Thursday but sooner or
later we had done this next week I
wouldn't even be in a song so I'll be
alright you're still able to come in
barely
what was the first concert you ever went
to I would say I went to summer jam with
Tom and Justin recess like forth Rob was
sick and this is when lo Wayne had
lollipop out
and I'm incarnated the remix and Wayne
brought Kanye out if you actually watch
the documentary you can see it on
YouTube there's in the crowd the Google
Wayne is about to drop a high pop
economy about to come out you see I had
a red DC shirt I took the red shirt off
and I was twisting in the air and in the
documentary you could see the crowd and
someone doing that in the air and that's
actually me so it's pretty funny but
that is the best concert I've ever been
to
I strong every single person you don't
prefer the country music concerts I've
taken you to I love you but my first
concert was the Spice Girls and it was
right I'm sort of sad because it was
right after Jerry left so I was only for
them and Jerry was my favorite so but it
was still like one of the best concerts
ever what was your first broken bone I
broke my finger yep when I was a senior
in high school my biggest oh you can
compare to how is she
cuz he's a little broad in it how did
you break it again I forget
so senior year like the fifth game into
the season our starting quarterback on
her and the backup came in John Okeefe
he's probably watching this book he
threw a pretty crappy ball like it was a
duck and it was wobbly but it's not said
if he always do like that but it was a
bad throw and I caught it but it what
happened wasn't the ball came in it was
just such an awkward spin and spiral
that it just pushed my finger back and
what happened was my finger was like my
knuckle was over here my finger was just
off like I never forget I like it
shocked me I got up and I looked down on
my whole sheet something's wrong like I
need to go in bah bah bah so I tore
every ligament in the middle of middle
link of my finger and they did immediate
surgery that night
to repair it I really had no choice I
wanted to just tape it up and keep
playing yeah ruin my scenes well or
season but that was my first broken boat
my first broken bone dinner down is
never yes I've never broken a bone knock
on wood
speaking of broken bones this did not
happen like accidentally this was
something I did on purpose just so they
know oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's not
broken heat you'll poster yeah I'm gonna
post some time I'm just gonna say just
in case you guys are wondering this
isn't because of an accident this was
purposely done I mean not purposely well

the chipper my tooth I hear I had like a
million ear piercings my cartilage done

skin oh my god my belly bottom hair
sometimes when I turn the dad turned 14
when was your first attention first
detention yeah wait for school yeah
actually no I got I guess I got the
detention for hugging a girl in seventh
grade actually right in the crazy I got
in trouble for hugging a girl in seventh
grade in my locker brought down to the
office with that girl at the time she
was my crush we have we both sat there i
was so embarrassed because i was getting
in trouble
plus I was like this was my girl I like
you know in roots and we got in trouble
and I think I'm pretty sure I had to
stay in school suspension I hope that's
the same thing as like hugging because
my first attention I actually got
detention one time in my life and it was
like junior year of high school one of
my
it she was one of my best friends at the
time I found out that she was hooking up
with Mike my first ever boyfriend we had
just broken up and I found out that they
were hooking up so I went up to her and
lunch and I was I remember I was like
sweating because I was just fuming I
went up to her and I just started
screaming at her and I really wanted to
hit her I didn't hit her but someone
came up and links that boy doesn't both
got detention so there's only time I
ever got detention I should really go
hit him believe me I was I don't think
I've ever been that mad like what good
shall that point I was just like I
walked up to her and I was like I like
went crazy but I didn't hit her I don't
have time like someone came up so
quickly because I was literally
screaming I was like kind of mad mad as
I've ever been
what was the first lesson you ever took
like learning your lesson I guess I
drove a parked van into a river once yes
tell him the story so my dad worked
behind like a pond he used to do I used
to make cabinets for Mike Golic install
your kitchen you know wall unit for your
den for your TV all that I remember I
was a little kid I was always intrigued
with things I didn't understand so I I
was in this I guess his van and the back
doors were open nothing was in the van
but it was facing a pond in the back
think of his of his work and I just
pulled the thing I guess the keys were
in the ignition I pulled the know what
else and then it just started moving and
I'm like oh god I don't know what to do
so I read out the back of the van and
the van went into this pond and it
killed it literally into the pond right
into it oh my god a lot of trouble but I
was a young kid so bit English
you weren't really younger and how old
are you I don't know probably six or
seven yeah what life lesson did you
learn uh when you don't know something
or don't know what something is don't
mess with that thing you know don't you
don't know anything about the thing
whatever it is don't mess with me
then think before you do something
that's my first I don't have anything
good like that don't think this is
really a lesson um when we were younger
my dad I didn't know how to ride a bike
yet so my dad put like another bike seat
in front of his so I would always like
sit in the front of his bike and I
always had to like keep my feet up like
this and while he was riding and one
time I put my foot down because I was
like uncomfortable and my foot got stuck
in like the chain part of the bike and I
had like a cut all the way up my leg and
I remember I was that was like one of my
first ever given memories of me just
like freaking out and I don't know what
that is listen no what you're told
hmm don't put your foot in the bicycle
chain maybe that's the lesson and last
but not least who is the first
beauty-related person you watched on
YouTube and these questions like are not
that great I no need to redo these
questions we should have done is we
should have asked them 15 questions they
were I know better well here's what
we're gonna do I'm gonna snapchat and as
people ask us questions we're not
answering any more of these stupid
questions so let's see how do I set it
so people can send me setting hi guys so
me and Brett are filming a video and we
didn't really like the questions that we
were answering so video ask questions
right now but only videos no pictures
and we're going to answer something on
camera oh that's a good question
where is our dream because you're a
critic that was from no that was from M
clutch field
thanks mrs. Crutchfield where is our
favorite vacation spot Bora Bora Bora
but at the same time you want to go to
know you want to go to Cabo back okay
so that's where we want to go but as far
as where we've been I would say Mexico
final Carmen was unreal okay Charlotte B
Oh Charlotte Charlotte Shawn
Oh is there anything we regret doing I
would say I regret I'm renting from this
place that we're at right now why it was
to get us out of the last place it was
like a stepping stone we're looking for
a new place right now um I regret
letting her buy so many clothes you
don't have a say over who pays no Serena
so what am i good question yeah thanks
Charlotte I feel like every you can't
regret anything because it all brought
us to this point right here yeah so you
know besides things that you like
ashamed of doing it's like you learn
from those shit those things this is
from Han h le MCD when did you guys fall
in love how cute is she uh it was night
something's yeah could be when did we
fall in love I fell in love with her
probably I know somebody creepy not
really creepy but I didn't really fall
in love but I always like looked at her
when I was a little kid I was a
discussant maybe so cute when she grows
older or she'd be so hot whatever I was
just I was like in the back I know I
didn't love you
you're always like in the back of my
mind and then I really fell in love do I
think probably when we went to LA with
me you're Sam and Dave because I learned
more about how she felt about me because
at first I was kind of unsure and then I
realized with my actions what I was
doing the way she was feeling it
dictated that she really does love me
or like me at the time and I was just
like at the time I was just like this is
an amazing thing like I can't believe
that she even loves me after all the
crap that we went through or whatever
and then I asked her out like like
normally because we were even you know
be my girlfriend whatever and that's
when I knew I fuckin off this girl came
like I would kill for this girl so I
loved him the second he texted me I
remember like getting butterflies nobody
likes me I just always like loved like
the idea of him I didn't really know him
until we actually really started dating
this time around like I I feel like I
loved your appearance which like we old
yeah which was where it started but like
I always say to myself like
sixteen-year-old Carly would never
believe that she ended up with Khepri
uni and the best part about it is like
once I found out who he really was in
his personality I was just like I just
don't the luckiest girl alive like they
don't make them like you you're just
such a big giant muffin in this gorgeous
little body so nicely though I feel the
same way about you was the first time I
felt like I did not play any games you
name units like so many girls come off
like playing all these games and all
these psychological things and she was
just like babe she's like I look and I
remember feeling like I don't have to
worry about things I do anymore her how
she feels about me because I know she
really does you can't do anything now
that'll make me not love you so it's
like but the first date if you farted on
me I probably been grossed out but it
this is good what above all right should
we go to the next one this is from gab
underscore gasps oh so I'm just
wondering if you guys are ever planning
on getting married and by the way I love
you we love you um yes reporters yes
we're getting married
X Stace Lin travel one place together
where would you love to go well so it's
in question I honestly can't handle you
guys like I just love you um we kind of
answered that already somewhere like I
want to be on a hut with nothing around
besides water like crystal clear water
obviously though I am NOT introducing
this I want to go somewhere pour like a
third-world country and I want to like I
just want to go somewhere and maybe help
people for like a day I'd be a really
cool thing because it helped me feel
better about myself and all the things
I've taken from this world you know you
want to do that type of stuff and get
back that's just something I've always
wanted to do I'm not just saying it cuz
what on camera I just really love to do
that and I was when I was hugging my dad
the other day and I was telling them
about the trees for change giveaway that
I was doing he was like you know the one
thing that always sticks out to me about
you is like whenever we'd go on our
cruise ships like and some islands we'd
get off and we wouldn't go do touristy
stuff like we take some like cereal
boxes and stuff from the cruise we put
it in our bags and we go around and just
like pass them out to little people he's
like that's what I vividly remember like
instead of doing like fun activities
like you would be the first person
running around like handing out like
food to be phone Sesto sits in your
heart
hmm okay next Katie Ann rod cried you
and about every other person one day
Katie Audet what is your favorite things
to do together
what do you guys love about each other
the mess Katie you definitely work at an
auto shop and you're the best for doing
that so thank you for putting up with
whatever assholes that work at that shop
with you don't favorite thing you do
together
new experiences definitely like going
somewhere I'm going to before in like
looking back on that it's like I think
that's something we love to do a lot you
love to like look back on things and
reminisce and stuff like that but new
experiences yes traveling crazy and love
- oh oh my god I bet overcoming every
pie why can't I replay it already repent
your crazy love I'll tell her I didn't
get to watch from Santa Ana California
yeah
Edith 0-3 how did we do is what the hate
with hate um to be honest I feel like
there hasn't been a lot of heat lately
which is really nice like my page is
just filled with love and positivity but
just delete and block the haters because
doesn't matter what they say I have
something to add because I don't think
sometimes they leaving a blocking isn't
a way to go in my opinion I think it's
better to take a an approach like more
or less not really acknowledging that
because if you delete our block now but
they'll kind of think that you
acknowledge it so it really depends on
the situation but also if someone's
hating on anything we're doing like
we're not doing anything that's going to
make anybody like purposely hate us for
a real reason so we know that it's all
bs so it's easy to just be like whatever
this is just comes with the territory
it's normal once you can master the
thought of not really caring what people
have to say because you know that the
real people out there who admire you are
real and they never would do something
or say something like that and you'd be
all right
if there's something in your life like
that happening just use it as fuel use
as inspiration to be a better version of
yourself that's a better answer it's
just once your once you're confident in
yourself and you know everything that
they're saying is just pure national
code you have to Deline black people
noxious or there you are as a person but
like anything they're trying to say
about you you should know that you're
better than that and that you're not any
of those things are calling your sherman
0:12 hey sorry I'm really not sure I
just a photo but my question is was your
love love at first sight when the rashes
hey guys so they got even working um for
me it was yeah I mean for hen I don't
know first time I saw her she was like
the sick so I wasn't love at first sight
because I kind of was like not thinking
love when I first saw her but yeah
eventually it became love so yeah
Maria underscore Khan one two three four
five girls what's my favorite animal was
it an animal penguin is that an animal
is a penguin an animal of course it is
so really cat Blanca wants to know how
to make a long-distance relationship
work um communication with technology is
definitely on your side
yeah don't see each other like there
FaceTime you literally track somebody no
too late you can see waiting really hard
I've had the location on it so I think
it's so much easier to do that now that
it was something like five or ten years
ago you just got to make sure that
person is down for you and then you got
to be able to trust them out of your
sight you know that's really the only
thing and just realize words are very
easy to say it's actions that show you
the real person
Nicolle G oh yeah
oh yeah that's I drama like people sure
break the silence you know uh-huh
so people spent rumors and like say
things yeah kind of like get us to break
up people who think what's best for her
isn't her vice versa he's dealing with
the social media aspect of it all as
opposed to real life and making sure
that nothing can distract us from being
you know social media doesn't distract
us or anybody else says in distract us
from really you know caring by each
other being in a good relationship and
healthy and all that stuff because now
there's all that stuff online or people
are like it might look like it's a good
relationship but it's all for facade or
it's all for fun but that's not us
because we're really not any different
on social media than we are like we're
not recording her except that 90% of the
time we don't look as good as we do in
social media hmm amber Leslie when am i
coming to Toronto or Canada um hopefully
really soon it's only like an hour plane
ride did you know that she got so
excited but hopefully release really
soon I honestly love Canada so if you
weren't doing YouTube it was a good
question that was when Caroline p23
Caroline p23 would be what would you be
doing one of the first if it wasn't on
YouTube yeah I'd probably be I was
modeling when we first I was like trying
to like the actor thing and I was going
to like acting classes stuff so I just
would've pursued that it's really hard I
mean I'd probably still be freelance
freelancing which I do miss doing um I
always said though I wanted to work with
penguins
just like work at like an aquarium and
get to yeah exactly like movie good luck
chocolate that would be me
what's the key to a happy healthy
relationship good eyebrows Nina V that's
the key love and respect and utterly
respect respect communication sacrifice
selflessness it's true most I would say
is respect because if you don't respect
the other person leave it and then it
all falls

that was from xx and XX now and all the
us and sex move um what was the one
thing that inspired me to keep doing
