hello my beautiful ladies so this is
going to be my first ever vehicle just
be telling you a little bit about myself
I mean you are watching my videos so why
not get to know me a little bit I'm 21
years old and I am from New Jersey a lot
of you could tell just from my accent so
sorry
can't help it I was always into art
growing up and makeup just kind of came
naturally to me I would always do my
friends makeup and I would watch some
YouTube videos back way back when when
there really weren't any and I really
learned a lot that way basically looking
online and reading different blogs and
stuff you kind of get to learn a lot
plus practicing on yourself that also
helps I actually started doing it on
other people like for events such as
sweet sixteens my junior year of high
school so that was really exciting and
ever since then just for more two mouths
i've been doing that so right now that
is my only job I am a freelance makeup
and hair stylist so for those of you who
are wondering that that is my job right
now over the summer though I do work at
a golf course
I do the carts like I Drive around the
golf course and I felt like alcohol and
some food seriously it's like the
easiest funnest job ever because you're
outside all day so you can get a nice
tan while I'm working so nothing really
beats that so I probably will work there
a couple more years however many or more
years I can get out of it but it's funny
because a lot of you were wondering how
old I am and it's funny because I either
here I look older I look like 24 25 or I
look like I'm 15 so I'm only 21 on my
birthday's in October so I'm a Libra for
those of you who follow your horoscopes
I used to be like sickly obsessed and
then I realized there's more to life
than reading your horoscope everyday
right now I am still in school I go to
college and I'm going for my business
degree I figured why not go for business
I mean I know I want to do something
with hair and makeup but it is really
important I think to have a degree so it
businesses it is for me one
that most people don't know about me and
find it pretty shocking which I don't
really know why sorry there was a hair
me um I'm obsessed like obsessed with
penguins it's like a problem I have I'll
show you a picture I'll put a picture up
but I have like 50 penguin stuffed
animals in my room I don't know why I
started like loving them I think
basically if you like research into
penguins and you find out about like
their mating behaviors and just
everything about them they're just so
cute and fluffy and I love them and yeah
how would you not another thing that I
love that most people don't know is
country music country music is by far
the best music out there I'm sorry if
you disagree with me I'm not hating on
any other kind of music I personally
love all kinds of music so I don't think
it's right first if someone says I love
music and then they say they hate
country music then you don't really love
music like the reason I love country
music is because the lyrics um I just
have meaning to them like you can listen
to a song and it can be like exactly
what you're going through and then it's
like oh hey well you know I'm not going
through this alone somebody else went
through this and it will get better so
that I think is one of the main reasons
also growing up that was basically all
my parents listened to it was country
music so I think that also was where it
started I currently just lived with my
mom my sister just moved into the city
she's so lucky I'm so jealous but on
city as in New York City so I have a
place to go crash every once in a while
um my mom is my best friend
I mean her get along so well which I
think is really important speaking of
family one of my best friend her name is
Sam she is a DJ which some of you
actually really helped her out by
getting her I think in like seventh
place out of hundreds for that DJ
competition she's basically like family
she's pretty much lives here um I love
her for those of you who were asking
what color my hair is I use the box dyes
from Walgreens it's I use l'oreal
preference I think they're like three
four dollars a box because I need two
boxes because I have a lot of hair
so the color that I just recently used
was is called just dark brown it wasn't
a little bit darker at first so it this
is after like probably ten washes so I
like how it is right now it's like a
chocolate brown at first it's like an
almost black so I don't know if you
don't mind at a couple days then I
suggest you use it because I do love the
box size are easy to do and I mean like
every time I went to a salon for a
haircut or to get my hair colored they
never do what you want like I don't get
it it's like they do what they want so I
think that's basically another reason
why I just learned how to do so much of
everything like by myself I even cut my
own hair I know a lot of people were
asking about my haircut um for those of
you that do I I do cut my own hair so I
don't even know if it's a real hair
style what I do is I do from from like
here down I just have all one length
like I don't start the liar's to like up
up here and then what I do is the front
I take it forward and then like I cut it
on an angle so I like angles in the
front and then the back I'll have some
shorter layers my shortest layer just
like this so it's like oh that got
really long I need a haircut
um but yeah usually I like doing a
little bit below my chin but they've
grown out a little bit so I'll just do a
couple layers in the back and that's
just to give it some body I don't I
remember when I first got layers in my
hair I actually went and got it done and
they cut they started the layer so low
that my longest piece was so thin that
my hair wouldn't grow and I had to wait
to like the layers grew out all one
length for it to actually grow so that
was really annoying so I'm just rambling
on it's funny because I'm sitting here
in my room talking myself well I mean
not really because I will be posting
this so you can see it but my mom's
downstairs probably like it's wrong with
that girl
one thing that's really funny that I do
that you guys don't know because you
only say from here up well right now I'm
actually wearing a dress but and it's
just us from American Apparel if you
were wondering oh and speaking of what
I'm wearing this necklace I bought this
yesterday from bebe isn't it so cute
there's only 34 dollars which really
isn't that bad but what was I saying oh
yeah what's something that you guys
don't know usually like when I
the shirt on or whatever I have
sweatpants or pajamas underneath or no
no pants at all and it's funny because
do you like I love your outfits and I'm
like thank you but I'm really wearing
sweatpants as pants but that's a little
secret you don't have to know that but
one thing that is really weird about me
is I have like a phobia of matching
socks like I don't think it's ever
possible for me to match my socks like
if I have to the same socks on it like
freaks me out like one is either like
hot pink blue or one striped and ones
like up to my knee it's like really
really weird I don't even think I own
matching socks anymore like they just
get like lost in the wash and who knows
if you were wondering how I am because
some people think I'm tall I'm really
not solemn only 5 foot 2 I'm like a
midget but that's my love heels because
I have the best of both worlds that can
be a midget one die or I can grow 7
inches miraculously the reason that I
started doing all this was really
because if I would maybe post a picture
on Facebook or just even go out to the
mall and someone would like compliment
me on my makeup I would just felt like
it's so easy for me so why not teach
other people so they can feel better
about themselves like I've been like
self-conscious I've been through
basically probably a lot of things that
most of you have been through and like
it's not fun like you just you really
want to feel like good about yourself
like even inside obviously matters way
more like if you feel good about
yourself inside and you can make
yourself feel good about how you look
outside like what it just makes you a
better person it makes you a happier
person also and one thing that I started
doing over the summer was listening to
this app it's called relaxin sleep while
it's like kind of like a meditation
thing and I swear over the summer me my
friend Sam would listen to it every
single night and towards the end of the
summer like the end of August that's
when we both kind of started this like I
started my beauty thing and she started
the whole deejay thing and it's really
like we've gotten pretty successful from
it and it's all just you got to stay
positive and positive things will happen
I really like the leave-in energy like
good energy like on my door here I'm
gonna get the sign that's on my door
this sign on my door it's kind of cheesy
but hey I made it it's
it says please take responsibility for
the energy you bring into the space yeah
I hung this on my door when I was going
through my Zen stage but no I really do
believe that though like I'm even with
like relationships with people like I'm
always nice to somebody unless they give
me a reason not to be and some people
may see that as being fake but honestly
like if you don't if you're nice to meet
like two people how you wanna be treated
like if you approach somebody with an
attitude like why would you expect them
to be nice to you you know what I mean
so I just think it's really important
just be nice and I mean if somebody
wants to be mean and like hate on you
for no reason then that's their problem
they can spend all their energy and time
doing that but like for me I'm just I
just think it's stupid a lot of you were
asking me to do some outfit of the days
so I'm gonna definitely start doing
those I do have a serious shopping
addiction so maybe if you guys want I
can give you like a tour one day of my
room and my closet and just kind of show
you some of my new stuff but yeah like I
said I just got this necklace and I love
it I love gold jewelry Gold's definitely
my favorite um this bracelet is from
where did I get this this is actually
doing forever 21 which it's really cute
and like it doesn't look like it'd be
from forever 21 and this is also from
Beebe I got it on sale for $11 like
couple months ago that was exciting and
then I already told you about me dress
so what else do you want to know about
me oh I my nationality if you were
wondering I'm Russian Austrian and Irish
basically those are like the three major
nationality so to say that makes me who
I am but there are a couple others that
I am I think I'm a little bit polish and
isn't it sad that I don't even know I
just am a month because there's so many
and it's like so confusing I forget all
the time so for now I guess that's
really most of the questions I think I
hopefully answered for you guys if you
want me to do more be logs let me know
know about why because I don't really
know what to do I mean besides we can do
like a room tour my diet and exercise
which you guys wanted to know - um thank
you for watching and honestly I just
want to say like I truly mean this like
with everything like every single one of
you are so amazing and like it just gets
me like so excited like to wake up every
morning knowing that like I'm gonna be
helping other people on that like you
guys appreciate it and I love all the
comments and the feedback and it really
really like makes me so happy and like
I'm really so appreciative and I can't
thank you enough so so that was my first
V logon a little bit about myself
alright I'm gonna stop rambling now so
thank you guys
oh also if you like my makeup right now
kind of natural little pretty little
bronze look to it I'm going to be
posting the tutorial on how I did it
