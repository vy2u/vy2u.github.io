truth is my last love left me hanging on
the line I never thought I'd get back
your minute
hi everyone thank you for watching so
it's been quite a bit since I've done a
fun dramatic smoky look I was inspired
the other day because I picked up a new
pair of velour lashes and I ordered a
pair of the bottom ones which are named
Kardashian actually and I wanted to try
them out because I know I'm a huge fan
of big spidery clumpy lashes but I
thought it would be cool to recreate a
look inspired by Kim using the bottom
lashes and then these really awesome top
lashes as well before I started with the
tutorial I wanted to do a quick review
on the velour lashes because I know I
had a bunch of people asking questions
about them because I mentioned them in a
few other videos so a few things I
wanted to point out about these velour
lashes are a that you can get about 25
uses out of them which is so amazing
because on average you get around two
maybe three uses out of a normal pair of
lashes that would cost you around five
dollars so when I came across these and
I noticed that the durability was a lot
longer that was a huge selling point for
me because I don't know if you're
spending the money on lashes I don't
like to maybe use one or two times
because usually you'll find a pair that
you love and you're gonna have to go out
and spend lots of money buying a hundred
of them because you're gonna want to
keep reusing them so that is one of the
main reasons I'm loving the velour
lashes also they have a very fine
feathery feel to them so they feel
really natural and I feel like your own
lashes and when you guys get them you'll
see that you barely need any mascara
because they're thick they're massive I
wanted to point out that no animals
whatsoever are harmed during the process
if you go on their website they have a
whole description on how they're
actually made and how no animals are
hurt when I was freelancing a lot one of
the things that I noticed for putting on
lashes on people who have not worn them
before is that they tend to hurt their
eyes and they weigh down their eyes and
they get a little bit pointy and then
hit the inner corners of your eyes with
these they have a really really soft
cottony band so it's very flexible and
it's not hard it's not going to be
pointing into your eyes and if you
haven't worn lashes you probably have no
idea what I'm talking about but for
those of you who do wear them on a daily
basis or you all the time you'll know
what I'm saying when you get the really
hard edges and that tend to poke in your
eyes this is completely different and
there
really lightweight and they feel like
nothing on your eyes for the month of
November in December I do have a 15% off
code for these lashes and I wanted to
share that with you guys because the
holidays are coming and these are
perfect stocking stuffers so you can use
my code Carl evil or 15 and that's going
to get you 15% off your whole purchase
so I will be listing all this
information below as well but I just
wanted to cover it because I know I use
both of them in this video and I don't
want you as asking a million questions
wondering why I love them why they're so
expensive and everything like that so I
hope you guys enjoy this look and I will
see you later bye my eyes I'm just going
to be using some concealer and this is
going to go all over my entire eyelid
the first color I'm using is from my new
18 color galaxy chic palette from BH and
I just got this one and the big colors
are so amazing I'm using this bronzy
color and I'm going to be applying it
all over my entire eyelids
then picking up this shimmery brown
color I'm going to be applying that in
the crease of my eye with my big
blending brush
taking a smaller blending brush and the
shimmery black color I'm then going to
be applying that right on the outer V of
my eye I had dipped my brush into mac
fix+ just to pick up the pigment and
make it darker you can also use eye
drops as a cheaper alternative
going back to my bigger blending brush
and this light beige color I'm then
going to be blending out what I had just
previously done and the key is to blend
everything so it gives it a nice faded
look
to line my eyes I'm using also by BH
Cosmetics a gel liner in black and I'm
just going to be lining my upper lash
line
taking a small angle brush and a little
bit of this black color I'm going to be
drawing a line underneath my eyes
following bad I'm picking up this bronze
color that I had previously used and
going right over that line again as I
said the key to this look is blending so
I'm just gonna be taking my blending
brush and blending out everything that
I've done to highlight underneath my
brow I'm just picking up a really really
pale yellow shimmery color from my BH
120 palette and then I'm going to be
blending out my work
as I mentioned the beginning of the
video I'm using velour lashes these ones
are called lash in the city and these
are definitely their most popular pair
and one of my favorites and I'm going to
be applying this on my upper lashes what
I always end up doing is cutting the
inner corner just so they're not as long
and then I apply my glue and we a couple
seconds till it dries and then just
apply them on my upper lash line
for my lower lashes I'm using also by
the lure these ones are called
Kardashian and they're going to feel a
little bit weird at first but once you
apply your mascara on your lower lashes
they're going to feel fine
I'm just taking this black eye pencil
from Milani and I'm lining in my lower
lashline and this is important because
when you're applying the false lashes if
you don't do this it's just going to
look like a big hole in between your
eyes and your lashes and it's not going
to look as natural so I'm just using the
pencil and then I'm blending it in with
my Mac blending brush
to line my lips I'm using Tony by
Jordana cosmetics
for lipgloss I'm mixing ultimate dish
and talk softly to me and I originally
just put the nude one on and then after
a few minutes you'll see I applied the
Pinker one just to give it a better look
and not to match my skin tone so much
for blush I'm using this peachy color
and I'm going to be applying it on the
apples of my cheeks and I'm also going
to be applying it as if I was contouring
and then I'm taking my foundation brush
just to blend it all out
so this is the final look I definitely
recommend this for a night out or a
formal event this is a very dramatic
look but it's perfect for the holidays
coming up and it's a perfect smokey eye
especially when you're going out for the
night so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and until next time I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
