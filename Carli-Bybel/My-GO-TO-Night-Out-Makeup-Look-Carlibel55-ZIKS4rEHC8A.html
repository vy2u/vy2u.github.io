have too much to say she hits man she
understands she don't let go of an
affair even when the pain gets really
bad hi everyone thank you for watching
so after I posted my last fall fashion
video I saw a ton of you guys requesting
how I did my makeup for all of the looks
so I was about to go film another
fashion video and I figured why not do
the same makeup and then just show you
how I did the entire look so this is
kind of part two to my highlight and
contour video that I just posted this is
the eye part so if you want to learn how
I did the full face I will link the
video where you can find that out so I
hope you guys enjoy this video and I'll
see you guys later bye my eyes I'm just
using a concealer and I'm going to be
applying that all over my eyelids and
that's going to help the eyeshadow stick
the pigment that I'm using is called
pink opal it is from Mac I did search
online and it seems to be sold out
everywhere but I have just picked this
up in the Mac store and this color is
absolutely amazing
ever since I picked it up I've been
using it a lot I like to use some fix+
to make it stick to my brush and then I
apply it all over my entire eyelids
you
mixing these two colors from my brow bar
I'm then going to be applying this color
right into my crease giving a little
shadow into my eye
from this Maybelline pod I'm taking this
dark burgundy color and I'm going to be
applying this right on top of the brown
color that I had just done focusing more
on the outer part of my eye
taking that same color and a small
angled brush I'm then going to be lining
my lower lash line
next I'm going to be applying a gel
liner this one is called onyx by BH
whenever I apply false lashes I always
tend to cut them in half so I can just
apply them on the outer part of my eye I
have pretty long lashes to begin with so
by doing this I just blend it in with my
natural eyes and I think it looks a lot
more natural this way it also doesn't
make your eye feel as heavy
I definitely used this lipliner almost
every single day that Jordana tawny and
following that I'm going to be applying
this new nude lip gloss that I just
picked up from Mac this one is called
ultimate dish
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and hopefully
learn something new and until next time
I'll see you guys later
still hell you made me sound
no so
you took the team on a bruised and
beaten hard
and then you realize
you want to have
