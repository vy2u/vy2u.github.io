hi everyone thank you for watching in
today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this super easy everyday fall
makeup look this is definitely my go-to
look during the daytime it's nothing too
much but it just is a quick routine to
really throw yourself together and keep
you looking nice and fresh so if you
want to see how I got this look please
keep watching to start off this look I'm
using my Mario Badescu oil-free
moisturizer I like to apply a
moisturizer before the primer and
foundation because it helps keep my skin
nice and fresh also it prevents it from
getting too dry throughout the day for
primer I'm using by la girl the pro prep
it's a new one that I just picked up
it's the smoothing face primer feel free
to use whatever type of primer that you
need if you guys have more oily skin you
can try one that's an oil-free primer if
you have drier skin try a more
moisturizing primer for me I have a kind
of combination skin so I like to use
something with a smoothing property in
it to help lower out any fine lines any
pores or anything like that I always
find that that's what works best for my
skin next I'm applying a BB cream this
one is the Tarte Amazonian clay it has a
little bit of an illuminator in it but I
love this one I'm just taking a little
bit on my finger and then I'm applying
little dots all over my face and then
I'm gonna blend them out
ah no
Hey No he's playing with my wire that's
connecting my light bear come here
you never met my friend you gotta come
here everyone ditches bear bear say hi
I'm a big ferocious bear he growls and
he looks like a teddy bear so that's why
mmm hey Cindy
I like this BB cream because it's super
super lightweight it's very light
coverage as well it's just gonna give
you kind of like an overall glow so if
you guys need a little bit of a fuller
coverage um I love the Smashbox BB cream
I haven't tried many others but that's
just the one that sticks out it has a
little bit more of a full coverage so
just all about preference what you guys
are looking for so I'm just applying a
little bit of this la girl concealer and
toast on my nose because you guys know
how much I love to contour my nose this
step is of course optional it really
takes me like no time because I've
gotten so quick at it so it's just
depending on preference
so before I blend out my nose I'm just
going to take a little bit of my
concealer and I'm going to apply that
under my eyes the reason I'm using this
concealer today it's a perfect daytime
concealer because it's super super
lightweight um it doesn't get cakey it
doesn't do any of that so lately I've
actually gone back to this one I haven't
used it and quite some time but I
actually was hating how much wrinkles I
was getting under my eyes when I would
use a thicker concealer so this one has
kind of been my go-to lately and it's in
nw20 so I'm just applying a little bit
under my eyes to some of you that you
might be like that's not a little bit
but for me it's a little bit I'm just
bringing it down in like a triangle I'm
not adding any more product I'm just
kind of stamping in wherever I want the
concealer you just want a little bit
down the bridge of your nose even if
you're not contouring you can apply it
on the bridge of your nose so I'm just
using a Beauty Blender mine isn't even
damp because we're in a rush I'm had
time to weigh right now umm I'm not
literally in a rush but I just wanted to
show you guys that this could be done
really really quickly so I'm just
blending that in and blending it over
the brown
if you guys don't have dark circles and
you want to skip this step of course
this is going to be a little bit extra
front every day look I'm not gonna lie
there's a lot of times where I won't
even do this much next grabbing you or
more tasty grip brightening powder I'm
just grabbing a little bit on a fluffy
brush and I'm going to apply that just
right under my eyes to set the concealer
and prevent it from creasing and then to
set the nose contour I'm just grabbing a
little bit of this gray tone shadow from
my next contour kit and that's just
going to very lightly go over the lines
just to set it because it is a cream
product now with a little pressed powder
I'm just going to go over those lines to
lighten it and make it blend in with my
skin tone
for I said I'm going to be using these
two mauve colors they're very light
they're my everyday go to look they're
perfect cuz they're very very simple
very light if you want to add it you can
make it a more dramatic look of course
you can keep adding and adding to make
it darker but I love these for a natural
everyday look I love this type of mauve
color in the shadows of my crease
because it's very natural and our own
shadows of our face have a little bit of
a purple undertone so it just blends
really nicely so I'm just gonna take a
little bit of each color on a big fluffy
brush and I'm just gonna put that right
into the crease and no I don't have I
shall don't want to start my eyelids are
just dark darker and it looks like I've
shadow on but it's not so I'm just
applying this in the crease and then I'm
gonna kind of blend it down onto the lid
too just to cover that and for anyone
who is wondering my palette is back in
stock Beach is having some really
amazing black friday cyber monday deals
so you guys should definitely go check
it out I will link it for you guys it is
a limited edition palette so it won't be
around forever so make sure if you guys
want to get any holiday gifts you do
your shopping now there are some amazing
deals as I said also the price of my
palette is still $12.50 I'm not sure
when they're going to be lifting that
I'm putting it at the normal price but I
know they're keeping at least for this
weekend and maybe for the holidays I'm
not exactly sure but I will keep you
guys posted with a smaller brush I'm
mixing the same colors I'm going to
apply a little bit under my lower lash
line
to bronze up my face I'm using the next
contour kit again I'm going to be using
a little bit of this shimmer and then a
little bit of the mat and this palette
is very pigmented so you just need a
little bit and it will go a long way I
didn't do my eyebrows next so I wanted
to talk for the rest of this video I
wanted to apologize for not having as
many videos up as I should some of you
guys probably know that we're in the
process of moving so it's been very
hectic over here and the holidays and
all that so I do apologize but the good
news is once we move like that's going
to be our spot forever so no more
Moving's i feel like we've been doing a
lot of moving the past couple years so
finally we'll have a hum and we'll be
back on track will have more space and
we're really really excited because
we're have our own space that's gonna be
ours that we can really like fully
decorate that we don't have to worry
about I'm gonna try and talk to you guys
and these kitties are gonna be loud they
want to stay up here with me for some
reason they can't go downstairs right
you just gotta hang out so you guys
haven't met bear well you already did in
the being in the video but you went and
got him last Friday from the same litter
so they are brother and sister and if
you guys don't follow me on snapchat you
have to because you just got to see how
cute they are all they do is just lick
each other and they're just honestly the
most precious little babies ever so I'm
so happy that we did that I definitely
see a change in Cindy she's happier
she's eating more she just I don't I
just seems like she's a lot happier that
she has her brother with herself best
decision ever allergy check um
physically I've been ok I gotta take a
claret in a few days I don't know if you
guys saw that when Cindy scratched me I
still have like the remnants of the
scratches I had like severe hives so you
could tell that I'm still internally
allergic to them but for whatever reason
I'm not like
sneezing and itchy on the outside so for
blush I'm using prenup by color pop it's
a beautiful mauve shade as well that's
kind of the whole theme I'm going with
since that's just my go-to especially
for fall I feel like it's a perfect fall
color so I'm just applying a little bit
on the brush and I'm going to have my
cheeks
since these blushes are a little more
creamy you can kind of push them in and
adult craze cats so as I'm saying you
can kind of push them into the face and
it'll give it a more pigmented look I'm
going back to that same pressed powder
that I used to apply over my nose and
I'm just taking a little bit on this
morphe mb4 brush and I'm just gonna go
over the contour in the blush so it's
not so crazy it just kind of brings
everything all together so you can see
for brows I'm using my brow bar to go by
whitening lightening and the darker
shade I'm just picking up a little bit
of the darkest Brown and I'm gonna fill
in my brows
I'm grabbing a little bit of this
shimmer I'm going to highlight my nose
because once you contour it you go to
highlight it and little highlight in the
corners why not
next I'm using my telescopic mascara I
haven't decided if I want to do bottom
mascara we'll get back to your lips I'm
using bicolor pop the lippy stick and
last call
I'm going to finish off this look with
my NYX matte finish setting spray I use
this in my last video and I really loved
how it looked
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I am now off to
go on a lunch date but I hope you guys
enjoyed I love you so much
and until next time I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
