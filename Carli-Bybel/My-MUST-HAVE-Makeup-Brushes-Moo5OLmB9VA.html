touch I know that you're scared but you
never hi everyone thank you for watching
so for quite some time now I've seen a
ton of requests for a video where I
basically talk about some of my favorite
makeup brushes that I use also why I use
them what I use them for etc so I'm
sorry it's taken this long for me to get
the video up but for those of you who
did request it this one is for you and
before I start I just wanted to show you
my new earrings they are from ludora
boutique so you can check out the
description box below I will be linking
where you can get these as well as all
the products that I mentioned in this
video so if you guys want to learn what
they are then please keep watching
so the first brush I'm going to be
talking about today is definitely my
number one favorite this one is from Mac
and it is the 188 foundation brush and I
use this in basically every single one
of my videos and I also use it on a
daily basis this foundation brush is
awesome for liquid foundation powder
foundation basically anything BB Creams
I've used it for everything
one of the main reasons I love it is
because of the soft bristles on top it
blends in your makeups so evenly and so
nice and it really does a lot of the
work for you I know some people don't
like using foundation brushes and they
use their hands but I really think that
the key to having a flawless looking
face is a great foundation brush and I
know Mac brushes are a little bit pricey
and they're more expensive than most
other brands but because I do freelance
work a few years back when I invested in
these brushes these were the ones that I
wanted because AI knew I was going to be
using them on a lot of different people
and B I knew from washing them all the
time and everything I didn't want to
have to invest in another set four or
five years down the road so these have
lasted me a couple years and they're
still in great condition and I back them
up a hundred percent there are a few
brushes from Mac that I found amazing
duplicates up and I will be talking
about for those of you who don't want to
spend the money or for those of you who
are just using the brushes on yourself
and I'll be talking about those in a
little bit but yeah for a foundation
brush this is hands-down my favorite it
comes
in three sizes but this 188 one is
definitely the best in my opinion the
second brush I'm going to be talking
about is also from Mac and this one is a
contour brush it's number one 109 the
I've had them so long they all faded I
believe it's 109 I'm going to
double-check for you and I will again
list everything below this brush I love
for many different reasons obviously I
love it to contour I love it to apply
bronzer and also blush so instead of
going out and buying three separate
brushes for all those three things which
I know some people do I like using this
as a three-in-one purpose so I get a ton
of use out of this I actually have two
of these because I use them so much and
I personally love it I have a Sephora
duplicate as well and it's pink but
they're basically around the same price
so I mean if you want to spend the money
these ones I really do recommend but of
course like I said there are going to be
a few duplicates that I will be
mentioning
after this brush because this one and
the foundation brush in my opinion are
the best and if you are looking for
amazing brushes or if you're a
freelancer just starting out these
brushes will do so much work for you so
as I mentioned previously of course not
everyone has the money to go out and
spend on Mac brushes so some of these
other brushes that I'm going to be
talking about I have all alternatives to
and the only brushes so far that I have
come across that were very affordable
and yet very awesome were the BH brushes
and they came in a set which they're all
these pink ones that you've probably
seen me use in a lot of my videos it
came in a set of about ten I'm gonna say
and it was so inexpensive that when I
saw it I was like you know what I love a
lot of their other products let me try
it out so I tried out the brushes and
that was about almost a year ago now and
I've had absolutely no problems with
them they're amazing and what I come to
find is since I do have the three jars
of all my brushes I have like duplicates
like I said so if they're the exact same
brushes whichever one I grab first are
the ones that I'm using on a day-to-day
basis and I think the only complaint
that I've had so far with the BH brushes
is one of the black parts came off of
one of the brushes and I just took some
nail glue and glued it back on and they
still work perfectly fine so as
now the Mac and the BH brushes are the
only ones that I personally approve of
and recommend for you guys of course if
you know any other affordable brands I
would love to hear your feedback so I
can go out and try them because I like
giving you guys options so for those who
like to shop online you have that option
for those who maybe want to just go to a
drugstore I can give you that option but
for those who are in the field and that
are freelancing and that are going to be
doing this as a work i really suggest
investing in the mac brushes i'm a
couple at a time you don't have to get
them all at once because again they are
ridiculously pricey but if you're going
to be using them a lot and you're going
to be washing them a lot you don't want
to have to buy a whole new set every
year you want to have a nice set that's
going to last you a few years the first
two duplicates I'm going to be talking
about are these small ankle brushes and
these are everything I use these to fill
in my eyebrows every single day I also
use these to contour my nose which helps
out a lot because it has such a small
tip and I also use these to draw lines
underneath my eyes I don't like using
eyeliner I prefer to use an eye shadow
so I'll always grab my angled brushes to
do that so very important brushes to
have in my opinion are these two angled
brushes this next one I just wanted to
mention really quick because I remember
I used to look at this and be like what
the heck do they use this brush for and
I've done that with a lot of products
and a lot of things so if any of you
ever saw this brush and was like what do
they use it for I know this is the exact
purpose of this brush but what I like to
use it for is loose powder I like to dip
it in the loose powder and then apply it
over my concealer and the reason I love
this is because it has such fine soft
bristles so when you're applying the
powder it's not going to move any of
your makeup it's not going to smudge
anything I'm just going to very lightly
apply a thin coat over your makeup and
leave you with a nice matte flawless
finish so yeah I just wanted to mention
that one really quick so when it comes
to doing eye makeup I have five brushes
that I can't live without and these are
the ones I definitely use the most and
the first one I'm going to talk about is
what I use for my eyelids also I use for
under my brow bone my tear duct anything
like that and that's just a flat brush
like this and it's a shader brush I do
have the Mac version but I honestly
can't find it ever since I got home
from New York and unpacked I can't find
it so this is the one that I've been
using this one is a great duplicate and
the Mac one that I have is also amazing
but I can't find at the moment so again
I like to swap between the two and
honestly if you're using a darker
pigment or a darker shadow and you don't
want it all over your face I recommend
either wetting the brush a little bit or
even using some fix+ or some eyedrops
and what that's going to do is it's
going to wet the bristles and it's going
to help pick up the shadow it's going to
help give it a richer color and it's
also going to help prevent fallout the
next two brushes unfortunately I don't
have duplicates for as of right now
I am on the lookout but these ones are
the Mac 224 and the 217 and these are my
blending brushes and if I had to pick
between the two I would definitely pick
the 224 just because ever since I've
gotten it I use it literally for
everything I use it for my eyes I use it
to contour my cheeks I use it to contour
my nose I use it everywhere and it's
just so amazing because does so much
work for you it does have very fine long
bristles so what that does is it's going
to blend out any of the work you've
already done so the smaller blending
brush I like to use if I'm doing a more
dramatic look I like to pick up the
darkest color on this and then start
blending it out from my crease and then
I go back to this one and I pick up a
lighter shade and then I go right above
the work I did and it just kind of
blends everything out really really
nicely and it does a lot of the work for
you so anyone who is a makeup artist or
a freelancer or anything like that these
brushes will do so much work for you it
will also cut down a lot of time so the
224 217 are absolutely amazing brushes
when it comes to blending and to getting
that beautifully blended look on your
eyes please again I don't have
duplicates for if any of you guys know
any that are cheaper please let me know
because again I want to keep you guys
updated on the best stuff out there the
next two brushes are the pencil brushes
this Mac 210 brush is it to tune 219 no
the Mac 219 then it's little mate over
here and these I like to use for
different purposes as well I like using
this if I'm applying a shadow underneath
my eye this is going to give you that
nice pencil look but it's also going to
give you a room to smudge it out and to
blend it out to make it look really nice
and to have it blend evenly with the top
part of your eye what I also like to use
this for is if I'm using a really dark
color for a smoky eye I like picking it
up because it has really really short
bristles so it's going to pick up a lot
of the color and it's going to give you
more access as to where you want to put
it so it's not going to be a big glob of
black on your eye it's going to be like
a little dot of black and you can slowly
gradually blend it out so it's not too
too too dramatic so as for brushes those
are definitely my absolute favorite my
must-haves I'm going to really quickly
also mention eyeliner brushes this one
is the 211 and this one is the one that
comes with the set and I use these all
the time they're amazing and it's
actually for me at least a lot easier to
apply a gel liner with these brushes as
opposed to the liners that come with the
stick already included one thing I
actually also noticed is the L'Oreal gel
liners I have about 4 or 5 of them they
come with the eyeliner brushes in the
pack so if you want to maybe try it out
before you spend money or if you don't
want to try the kit I definitely also
recommend that one it's just as great
and I have about three of them and
they're laying around somewhere but yes
so as for makeup brushes I think if you
use just the ones that I mentioned
that's really all you need I mean I
probably have about 50 brushes but
that's just because a lot of them are
duplicates and a lot of them are random
brand so I grab the drugstores and stuff
like that but none of them are worth
mentioning there's about one or two
maybe that are left in there because a
lot of the kits that I've tried out I've
had to throw away half of them so yeah
as of now these are my two brands for my
go-to makeup brushes again if you're not
in the makeup field and you're just
trying to play around and try out some
of the looks and you're really just
getting into makeup try out the BH kit
because literally I think it's 20
something dollars it's so inexpensive I
know that the specifics that I did
recommend that I didn't have to look it
up they are absolutely amazing in my
favorite but again most of the brushes
have duplicates for cheaper options so
options are endless I also want to hear
what you guys want to see next I had
posted a facebook status and I know you
guys were really interested in seeing a
makeup look for people with brown eyes
as well as maybe a video of me and Brett
talking about dating tips or anything
like that
so please leave any feedback below I
will definitely be going through the
comments to check them out and yeah so
that's it for my brush video I hope you
guys enjoyed and I hope you all have an
amazing day I'll see you guys soon juice
the best is yet to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
