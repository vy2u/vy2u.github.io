Scizor server Mustaine hi everyone thank
you for watching so I'm going to show
you my makeup collection you've been
wondering where I've been the past
couple of weeks this will explain it I
wanted to get everything nice and
organized so I'm gonna share with you
what I have in all of my drawers in here
I have all of my false lashes I have the
velour lashes my Mac lashes the Lilly
ghalichi lashes some hello gorgeous
some Ardell and the second one I also
have some more lashes I have mostly the
Ardell they send me a big box of them so
I definitely needed two drawers for that
but I also have a few other brands in
here but that's basically those two next
I have a bunch of pallets basically all
of my big pallets I have my Anastasia
contour kit in here I have some BH
palettes Urban Decay I have the two
naked palettes the nigga - and Naked 3 I
also got this cute little eyeshadow
palette and it's like Ariel themes which
I love
next I have all of my skincare in this
drawer I also have all of my Nerium
night lotion which I'm obsessed with
then this jaw is amazing I had these new
compacts organizers which just make
everything so much easier and that way I
can see all the different powders that I
have I have all my Mac ones in here I
have some highlighters and illuminators
I have the Becca opal powder right here
I love this one I also have by the balm
the mary lou manizer which is amazing
and i got my hands on a Mac whisper Gill
I got it on eBay and they paid a
ridiculous price for it but I just
needed it oh we're here I have some of
my Mac eyeshadows also all of these
containers are by allegory and I will
link every single one for you guys
because they're amazing they're great
for organizing everything this drawer I
have the mother lode of foundations this
is by bare minerals and they sent me
this and this is just incredible I would
have loved this when I used to real ants
more but this is every single shade
which is amazing so I can't wait to use
some of these I actually tried it on my
sister and it came out amazing and here
I have some extra eye shadows and then
moving on I have my sunglass drawer
until I'm done with my closet I'm gonna
keep them in there then down here I have
all my whitening lightening products the
whitening pens and then every single
brow product that I own I'm so happy
that I organized everything because it's
so much easier to find different
products so I have my brow bar that I
Nastasia all that good stuff
this drones just an extra jar with all
little brush kits and then down here I
have some more lipsticks I wanted to
store some of them away because it was
just way too much on the other counter

yeah there's a whole bunch of different
colors this one is absolutely my
favorite right now
then I organize some of my eyeshadows in
these ice cube trays which it's perfect
for organizing shadows some of the
acrylic organizers are really not that
expensive but if you want to do a
cheaper route I definitely suggest doing
this because it is awesome I have my
three little two-faced palettes they're
so pretty I love these
I just got this today actually they make
up forever the two eyeshadow palettes I
