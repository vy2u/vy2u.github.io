you look right through
space straight crossing hi everyone
thank you for watching so a lot of you
guys have been requesting a makeup
storage video or something of the sort
for a while now so I finally was
cleaning today and I figured why not
record just what I use to store my
makeup and show you a quick tour of my
vanity because other than my quick room
tour that I posted on my second channel
you guys really don't ever see my vanity
or see anything I use because my
camera's usually face the complete
opposite way in my room so if you guys
want to see a few things that I use to
store my makeup and how I store my
makeup please keep watching and majority
of the stuff that I used to organize I
did get online so I will leave the links
below so I got these acrylic lipstick
holders on Amazon and they were a great
investment because I like having them on
order this side I have all the nude
lipsticks and then the pinks and then
the dark ones right behind that I have
another acrylic organizer which has some
skin finishes from Mac and some blushes
my perfume that I use also my house line
so this is my vanity if you saw my room
slash closet tour from a few months back
on my second channel I showed this as
well and I've had this for about two
years now it's from vanity girl
Hollywood and I've had no complaints so
far it's amazing it's great because it
has the plugs as well as the little
slots for your hair dryer and your
curling iron so I love it for that
reason
on my vanity I also have another acrylic
organizer with some foundations and
basically the stuff in here is what I
use the most and I also have these
little drawers that are also from Amazon
I will link everything below but they
have basically the stuff that I use the
most these are all the gel liners I have
some pigments and stuff in there
on the bottom I have all my lip liners
eyeliners BB creams just yeah basically
a lot of the stuff that I use on a day
to day basis I keep in these drawers
because I am always sitting here at my
vanity and I like having them all in
front of me and this cute little card
it's from Brett I love this one I also
have a couple other cards from people
that I've met and here is a picture of
me my mum and my sister when we were
little having one of these mirrors in my
opinion comes in handy because when
you're applying your makeup it's a lot
easier having something that has a
magnified side for all my brushes I have
this little three cup acrylic organizer
that I got from pink Bed Bath and Beyond
and I just keep all my brushes right in
there and it all fits perfectly on my
vanity as you can see
this is my makeup organizer it is
acrylic and this one is by Cheri blossom
and I absolutely love this the top you
could see has some glitter and my
pigments and some face primers this
whole lid actually comes up so that's
how you get access to that these also
come with dividers in the drawers so I
divided each draw out this one with the
lip glosses i did in my color and here I
have some palettes and some Mac eye
shadows that I love on both sides of my
vanity I have the Alex drawers both from
Ikea this draw has all my lashes all my
skincare stuff this one is all of my
palettes that I have I feel like these
drawers were made for people like me and
other makeup viewers I know a lot of
them have these but as you can see I
have everything I even have all my
blondes and everything like that in that
draw and yeah it holds basically
everything so that's awesome
some makeup q-tips which are awesome my
wipes that I use every single night some
hair sprays through the way seriously I
swear by this stuff some people say it
doesn't work but for me it does so this
is like my draw of extra stuff that I
love that I have extras of so a lot of
these containers are actually labeled
makeup storage but this thing underneath
is actually from my jewelry storage and
it fits in there and then I put a couple
extra things on the side so you can
really use anything to store your makeup
as you can see these three cupholders
are perfect if you just have single ones
feel free to use those you can really
get creative with this and
do your own thing this nail polish
acrylic holder I got on Amazon I thought
it was a lot smaller so I ended up
buying two but it is pretty big and I
did the top row I put some of the
foundations that I'm not using at the
moment up there and the rest are just
some pretty colors that I've picked up
along the way
and when
