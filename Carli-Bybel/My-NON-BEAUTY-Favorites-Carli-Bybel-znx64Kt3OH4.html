today's video I wanted to share some of
my non Beauty favorites I feel like ever
since I've started youtube I have done
so many Beauty favorites and I don't
know if I've ever really talked about
some non beauty products that I use all
the time
just certain things that I really love
and then I'm always using that I just
really never talked about so if you guys
want to hear what some of them are
please keep watching so the first
product that I'm going to mention is so
important and it's honestly crazy how I
ended up finding out about this um their
tampons
I know tampons but I really wanted to
talk about these because I know I'm not
sponsored in any way I went to Wegmans
I'm gonna say about five months ago and
I needed new tampons and I've always
used like the typical brands the ones
that have like the scent and that are
all pretty and then they go and smooth
whatever so when I was looking for them
I saw this pack and I instantly looked
at it cuz I'm like organic tampons like
me I'm not trying everything organic
that's just one thing we've really
really been keen on and when I saw
organic tampons I was like okay that has
to be some sort of scam like what does
that even mean then the next thing that
I noticed that stood out was that it was
perfume free and totally chlorine free
so then I'm like chlorine free like why
would it say chlorine free does that
mean that the tampons that I were using
have chlorine in them so I started
grabbing the ones that I would normally
grab and looking through the ingredients
and I didn't recognize like anything
that they were mentioning and I also saw
that there was chlorine in them so the
only thing I could think about is why
the hell would they put chlorine in
something that we are putting inside of
us so I'm not a doctor I'm not a lab
chemist I don't create these things but
just off the top of my head I was like
you know what I'm sorry if something's
telling me there's chlorine in it I put
chlorine in a pool like I don't want
that inside of me every single month so
I picked up about three boxes of these
and this is what I've been using and I
wanted to share with you guys because I
feel like there's so many things that we
don't know about and
90% of the things that I've recently
found out from Brett are all from his
research and it's like so crazy that
nobody teaches us these things I can
understand people may not have the money
to buy food organically and may not
think that that even matters but one
thing that you guys should really think
about is what you're putting inside of
your body it's really sad that they
never teach us stuff like this in school
or really ever you have to actually go
out and try and research it yourself to
learn these things so I wanted to share
this with you guys
mostly because I know a lot of young
girls are watching this a lot of older
girls doesn't matter how old you are we
all go through this every single month
and if I can prevent some of you guys
from having chlorine inside of you that
will make me feel a lot better I
actually wanted to mention this sooner
and when I was running down different
ideas today I thought about this I was
like finally this is the time that I can
mention it for you guys so these are
organic they're chlorine free I did a
little research and these seems to be
the best brand out there that are
actually really natural and good for you
so I definitely recommend looking into
this a little bit further we only get
one body and it's so important that
we're taking care of it and we're
treating it right and we're not putting
chlorine or any gross chemicals in our
body that are going to affect us later
on in life so this is the first thing I
wanted to mention it's so important and
yeah the next product I wanted to
mention is this eucalyptus it's actually
a hundred percent pure eucalyptus oil I
got this right off of the Amazon and I
picked this up probably about a month
ago and it's actually amazing for
aromatherapy so what I do every single
night
it's good I just accidentally caught it
on my lip and I tasted it a little
enough that's good I don't know if
that's allowed anyways um whenever I'm
feeling congested or stuffy or I just
want to take a whiff of this I just will
take a couple little whips right
underneath my nose put the cap on and
put it back in my medicine cabinet it's
really really good if you guys have
stuffy noses if you have allergies it
just really clears you out and I don't
know if any of you guys have ever gone
for massages or and like that but I know
that they will give you the option to
have some sort of aromatherapy during
that massage so that's actually how I
found out about it but I just love it it
smells so good and it's just a more
natural way to clear yourself out
instead of using all those allergy pills
and sprays and all those other products
so I honestly love this I wanted to
share with you guys me and Brett use it
all the time and it really works really
well for us so next I wanted to show you
guys this awesome little makeup case
with me and Brett's picture on it I
actually got this from one of my
subscribers when I was in London and her
name was Jodie and isn't this the
coolest thing ever I honestly don't know
how she made this where she made it but
I wanted to share it with you guys
because I think this is such a cool gift
idea especially with the holidays coming
it's double sided so the picture is on
both sides and I've actually seen
similar things like this whether it be a
sweatshirt being made with a picture or
a mousepad or a magnet or what else have
I seen like blankets I've seen all kinds
of really cool gifts ideas that way but
a makeup case I actually use this all
the time whenever I use my bigger purses
and I'm bringing makeup with me
I just put my makeup in here to prevent
it from ruining my purse and it's
perfect so I just absolutely love it I
think it's so cute any time anyone sees
that they're like really you have that
I'm like no no I didn't make it for
myself it was a gift so it makes it okay
but I also love it
Thank You Jodie for this amazing present
and if any of you guys want to look into
this let me know if you find out the
website that you can do it I'll look as
well I'm sure it's not that hard if you
google it so love this the next thing is
this little jar I actually got this as a
birthday present from
the girls over at style hall it has
little notes in it um I put them back in
and I mix it around because honestly
they're that amazing they come in this
little envelope like this and you open
it up and there's a little inspirational
quote or a positive affirmation and it's
good I keep this right next to my bed
and then when I wake up if I'm not
feeling so hot I'll just reach over and
then grab for one of these
this one says may your heart and soul
find peace and comfort so I just love
anything with quotes I love anything
inspirational motivational you guys know
that already it's actually funny because
I think it was like two years ago two
years ago three years ago oh my gosh it
couldn't be three years maybe it was
three years I made a video actually
where you can create your own positivity
jar and what I was saying was for the
new year create a jar and write down
your memories or different positive
things that happen to you and put them
in your jar and then that way at the end
of the year you can open up your jar and
just remind yourself with some of the
awesome things that happen to you the
ear prior because we tend to forget a
lot of the good things that happen we
sometimes dwell in the negativity and we
can't remember the good things and
believe me I get that I've been there
but I feel like when you can write it
down and then re remind yourself at a
later date it's a really awesome amazing
way to really lift your spirits and to
feel better about yourself so if you
guys want to check out that video I
think it's on my inner beauty channel
and if you guys don't want to do that
you can go check this out I'm not sure
where they got it from I will check and
see if I can figure it out but um it's
just an awesome way to lift your mood
and lift your spirits and I just wanted
to share with you guys so next I have my
selfie camera the camera that everyone
asks about um so many people have this
camera it's really nothing nothing it's
nothing special because it is really
special but um this is actually the
third one that I had to go through that
is why I have this oh so gorgeous camera
case um so it's the white it's a white
one they come in white and black it's
the sony a 5100 it has the flip up
screen so that's why it makes taking
selfies so much easier this is also why
you always see me like looking a little
bit up in myself
these I don't know so the reason that I
do that and I know some people notice
and they're like why the heck do you do
that the reason I look a little bit up
is it makes your eyes look bigger so
that's really it so I just like how it
looks when I look kind of straight at it
my eyes won't look as blue nails a
little smaller so I look up and they
look bluer I don't know it's weird I
just like to do it that way but um it's
a really amazing camera it is expensive
so be very careful with it I do
recommend picking up a case this little
case is also from Amazon um what
happened was I had dropped this I think
like a week into having it it fell off
of my lap into the driveway the lens
broke I brought it to London it worked
the entire trip of London and in the
morning of beautycon I was about to walk
out the door I had it on my lap again
and it rolled off lens broke so just be
very very careful they are fragile
luckily with Amazon I think within like
30 days you can refund or get like a
replacement set so let's not go how to
repay for them which was nice but this
is the camera that I use all the time
for all of my selfies and then for
filming and my blog post I use the Canon
5d Mark 3 so next I have these little
slippers and the little penguin slippers
obviously I have two pairs of penguin
slippers actually but these ones I wear
all the time they're just so comfy I got
these from ASOS and I actually found out
about these because one of my
subscribers tweeted me a picture of them
so you know literally as soon as they
tweeted that's me I ran on the website
and I bought them because I live in
slippers like live in slippers so for me
it was a necessity to get them I'm
obsessed with penguins I'm obsessed with
slippers and mix them together and it's
just the world's greatest supers ever so
I don't know how much they were I'll
link them for you guys but also I got a
penguin pair from misguided and I know
they have a couple other animals as well
so if you guys love animals and you love
slippers you can go check them out it's
just so easy to walk around the house in
them it's really comfy my feet are
always freezing my hands and my feet are
like always numb always like ice cold I
don't know why so I'm always wearing
either fuzzy socks or slippers and I
just love them while on the subject of
fluffy slippers
kind of hard to show you but I have this
really really comfy robe and it has
little pom-pom balls this is from
Victoria's Secret I got this about three
weeks ago two weeks ago I do have
another one that's from Walmart that was
probably like ten dollars and it's
literally life it's actually being
watched right now so I can't show it to
you guys but it's so comfy it's like the
same material it's a lot more affordable
than this one this one's Victoria's
Secret so I'll link both of them if I
can if I can find it on Walmart calm if
not equal in the store and it was really
funny because on my birthday I was
actually getting my nails done at the
Walmart nail salon for those of you guys
who don't know yes I get my nails done
at Walmart on occasion they're actually
really good there and while I was
getting my nails done on my birthday
Brett came with me because any want to
sit alone and he was kind of browsing
around Walmart and he comes back with
this little fleece sweatshirt and he was
like I saw this I thought of you I need
to buy it for you and I was like oh my
god I was touching it I was like oh my I
love it I was like wait so as soon as I
got my nails I'm like wait before we buy
this I was like can you imagine they
have this in a robe material he's like I
looked I didn't see it so we walk around
and then like the older women's section
in the pajama area I found it and it
does look like like I think my grandma
has a robe that looks very very similar
which program is awesome so I don't even
care but I just touched it I love the
end literally I live in it every single
day as I mentioned before I'm always
freezing
another problem with always being
freezing as Brett's always hot so we
fight over the heat on or the heat off
or blah blah blah so it's always nice to
have a pair of slippers a nice robe and
that way you'll be nice and warm
especially for the winter because here
in Jersey it's like ridiculously cold so
I wanted to share those with you guys
because I live for them and if you don't
have anything buzzy in your life you
need it next I just wanted to mention
this little candle that is burning my
little beauty blogger candle this is
cinnamon vanilla Yankee Candle to be
honest I don't have a specific brand
that I like if I'm at Bed Bath to be on
I pick up the Yankee Candles if I'm at
Walgreens I pick up their brand I just
like a good smelling candle umm I don't
like anything
- - too strong because my allergies but
I've noticed with this one I'm okay if
it's like a french vanilla vanilla
cupcake all those flavors I'm really
okay with I just don't do like the
really fruity like really strong one so
the last item that I wanted to show you
guys or items I actually just recently
got these they are amethyst crystals and
I'm not gonna lie I went on the website
and they were pricey because they're
real crystals and when I ordered them
online they looked so much bigger so on
here I am thinking I'm ordering these
literally one of them was like 150 bucks
and I thought they were going to be
about like this big so in our new house
because we're moving in seven days
literally a week from today
um so weird by the way we haven't barely
started packing so anyway when I
purchase them I wanted to have like an
area in my new house where I have like a
bunch of really big crystals because I
just started looking into them and I'm
just very spiritual and I just believe
in all of that stuff so I picked these
up and they came in the mail and I was
thinking of returning them because
because they are kind of mini here open
one up so you could see so you can see
it is a little mini crystal but you know
what I'm just going to keep them because
I think they're beautiful and I just
love the whole meaning behind them okay
so I just want to read a little bit
about the crystals so you guys can get a
better idea
EMAS is crystals produce small
detectable levels of magnetic fields
while high levels of magnetic fields are
dangerous particularly from electrons
the naturally occurring magnetic fields
from amethyst may actually produce
favorable results in the body
since the body has its own magnetic
field it is possible that amethyst
interacts and exchanges energy with the
body this stone also generates someone's
calling me and I don't know it is
decline this stone also generates far
infrared radiation a type of long
wavelength radiation all light and heat
particles demonstrate this wavelength
x-rays have a very short wavelength
whereas visible light has a wavelength
that is much longer far infrared
radiation has a variety of health
benefits for the human body eight of
these health benefits include cell
regeneration sleep support blood
circulation fluid motility mood support
antioxidant active
wound support and bacteria fighter so
there's like a whole list of different
beneficial reasons to get them what
they're good for you can look into it a
little bit further but I've done my
research and that was like one of the
main things that I wanted in my new
house is like tons of crystals so I
picked up these ones um I'm going to
just explain to you really quick which
are the two that I picked up in why I
picked them up the first one is the
Brandenburg amethyst crystal so phantoms
are meditation crystals and healing
crystals used almost exclusively to get
in touch with the inner self for
purposes of self-knowledge they are most
specifically used to help in
understanding our inner needs that when
satisfied will bring us the happiness we
seek the true happiness and complete
fulfillment so there's a whole long
other list with it I'm not gonna bore
you guys with that sure some of you are
probably like this bitch is crazy so
this is the next one isn't some pretty
once I read to you this one you'll
understand why I wanted it we have
exciting new this is the description we
have exciting news this is a new
jeremial crystal of perception Jeremiah
Doran virtue tells us is the angel that
heals emotional ills perceiving root
causes is the most difficult part of
emotional healing these crystals bring a
love of angel Jeremiah to crystal
healing that love is focused on helping
the healer perceive the hidden and
fundamental issues of a healing process
these natural amethyst points up crowns
of small white quartz healing crystals
that gather in the healing energy of the
angelic and spirit world through their
multifaceted crystalline shapes then
transmute and focus it through the
amethyst healing rays that improve
self-esteem grow self-knowledge and
clear and focus our powerful self
thought areas of the crown chakra the
energy of the stone is similar to that
of one that that is cut using the
knowledge of Marcille vogel so obviously
there's a lot about this that I don't
really understand but the idea of it is
awesome and I'm just really big on all
the spiritual nosov life so why not get
some crystal stay as my collection so
these are the two that I got they also
sent a fairy cluster as a thank-you gift
so I got a little other one as well sure
that took up a lot more time than it
should
but I'm just really excited about them
and I want you guys to look into them
and let me know what you think so the
last two things that I really quickly
wanted to mention I'm not going to get
too far into them I will do a video
maybe getting a little bit more in depth
with them I recently downloaded two
books that I have been in love with I
really really really recommend you guys
reading them it'll just open your eyes a
bit I know I've always talked about the
untethered soul that has been my number
one but ever since I found this one I
have been upset so the first one is
called The Four Agreements
by Don Miguel Ruiz I will write the
names of these in the bottom so you guys
can go check them out I don't read a lot
but when I do and I find one that I love
like I really really want to share with
you guys I think it's so important and
it's really cool and the second one is
the fifth agreement which is just that I
guess sequel to the first one so they
are motivational spiritual books um I
have one of the pages as my background
on my lock screen I'll really quickly
read to you what the four agreements are
just so you can kind of get an idea of
what the books about so the four
agreements are to be impeccable with
your word to not take anything
personally to not make any assumptions
and to do your best every single day so
that's just such a brief synopsis of
what this book really is about what it
could bring to you it brought me so much
happiness and I've already told all my
friends and Brett that they don't have a
choice that they need to read it so I
really recommend reading it I love blogs
and I love learning new things and I
think this book will be so extremely
beneficial to so many people out there
to help me so many ways and I will be
rereading it this is one of the books
that I'll read like three four times
just like the untethered soul so if you
guys want to hear a little bit more
about it let me know and I could do
another inspirational video just kind of
talking about it giving a brief
description and just kind of talking
about what I've learned one more app I'm
going to talk about really quick um
because when I read at night Brett's
usually watching football so I put on my
headphones and I listen to what is this
app called it is called relaxed hem when
you open it it has
three six nine has nine little symbols
River ocean winds flute rain birds music
background music box lounge piano so you
can have them all playing at once you
can have one playing at once and it just
plays like a nice little um mixture so
this is what mine is and every time you
close out of it and go back in it will
have that same make sure that you have
picked so
so as you can tell which is very
soothing I think I doesn't tell you what
I picked but it's at Langley the ocean
the rain wind maybe the piano is
included I'm not really sure oh it does
tell you okay so that one was wind rain
and piano so that's what my little
mixture is I put my little headphones in
and then I'll read and that way I can
really like focus in because sometimes
when I'm reading I noticed my mind will
wander or I'll look up at the TV and
I'll get a little bit distracted so it's
really important to just kind of really
focus really take in what he's teaching
you because every time you read it you
will get even more knowledge from it but
it's just so important and I think you
guys will really really really love it
so I'm so excited that I finally have
another amazing book that I can share
with you guys let me know what you think
about it that is really it as far as
some of my non-beauty favorites at the
moment all of these things I've been
using for a while and I just love them
and yeah so that is really it for now I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I love
you guys so much and until next time I
will see you all later
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
