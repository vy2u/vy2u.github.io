the most requested video that I've had
for quite some time now is and get
unready with me video so I'm just going
to take you step by step on what I do
every single night first thing I always
do is clip up my hair sometimes I like
to fly out of my hand but I'm just gonna
throw it all up into a bun at this point
I had already taken out my hair
extension so if I did have them in I
always take them out before I wash my
face that way I can clip up all my hair
and make sure nothing is getting wet so
I'm switching my face wash I always like
to try new things but right now I'm
using that bu RA or unclogging scrub and
also grabbing my Seabreeze astringent
and my zero white whining pen now that I
have all my products I'm just gonna very
quickly rinse my face one or two times
just to get it wet then I'm grabbing my
Oleg cleansing brush and BB or a
cleanser and I'm just applying a little
bit right onto the brush I've been using
this brush for definitely a year and a
half maybe two years now and I
absolutely love it it really really deep
cleans and helps get all of your makeup
off and helps really clean your pores
so once I've scrubbed I'm going to add a
little bit more face wash onto my hands
and that is what I'm gonna get all my
eye makeup off so I just like to scrub
scrub scrub and then with a few rinses
of water I swear all of my makeup just
comes right off no matter how much
mascara how much black eye shadow I have
this is really my only trick I don't use
the eye makeup remover I don't use a
million different products get my makeup
off I just use my face wash and then a
little later on I'll show you what face
wipes I do use just to get any excess
mascara next up I'm grabbing my
stringent by sea breeze and this I've
used for ever I think since I've been in
high school and I like to use this
whenever I have a breakout or I have a
few pimples so now I like to shower at
night but since I washed my hair
yesterday I'm going to use this towel
twist Brett's mom got it for me for
Christmas and it's literally something I
use all the time but yeah so I'm just
going to take my shower and then
afterwards my favorite favorite lotion
is the Eucerin and the reason I like
this is because I have eczema and I also
have really really sensitive skin so
this one is called skin calming lotion
and it just has no fragrance in it so it
leaves my skin feeling really really
soft next up I'm just brushing my teeth
with my crest 3d white and I love this
toothpaste I've been using it for a
little over a year and after I brush my
teeth I always use my whitening
lightening zero whitening pen and I
would say maybe two weeks out of the
month is when I use it sometimes of
course I forget but thought it was
filming and this part wasn't shown and
for those of you who do use the pen it's
always good to use it right after you
brush your teeth
so now moving over to my vanity I'm
grabbing my deodorant which I always
apply after my shower this one smells so
good it's cucumber melon
next up I'm grabbing my clean and clear
acne spot treatment and I'm just
applying a little bit of this on my chin
and right on my nose I just have a
little breakout so I got to apply that
right before all the lotions and
everything
then picking up my makeup wipes I like
to use these ones by Mac and I've used
ones from the drugstore and they are all
really the same and like I said after I
wash my face I really do get all of my
makeup off so these wipes are just to
wipe off any excess makeup so feel free
to get any from your drugstore I'm sure
they will work just as good next up I'm
grabbing my favorite eye cream at the
moment this one is by meaningful beauty
and this product along with my next
product I found on an infomercial I was
sick one night and I don't know if you
guys saw the video where I mentioned the
when shampoo as well but I was up sick
and I totally fell for the infomercials
and I must say I actually went and
bought this and the face lotion right on
Amazon when you originally sign up they
send you something every month and it
was just too much product so I stopped
the automatic renewal I bought the creme
de serum and the eye cream right on
Amazon because these two are really
great and I love his products so this is
the first face cream that I like to
apply I only use one pump and then I
apply it all over my face
the next product I have been using for
over two years and this I like to call
my botox
in a bottle it is Nerium and if you guys
haven't heard of it yet I would be very
surprised because I've seen it
everywhere this cream is amazing you can
go on the website and see before and
after pictures all the links for all
this weed right in the description box
but this cream I absolutely love I have
my grandma my mom and Brett's mom using
it as well
it's a very thick consistency so when it
goes on your face it's going to
literally be like an instant facelift
and you guys probably saw me mention
this about a year ago in one of my
videos but I've really been using it
every single night and I really love the
results I think this along with no more
fake tanning is really
my skin and I do see a dramatic
difference next I'm grabbing my at-home
do-it-yourself eyelash serum and I
posted a video talking all about this
how to make it a few months back so if
you guys haven't seen it I will link it
below but this is just a serum that I
made and it really helps grow your
eyelashes as well as your eyebrows and I
like to apply this every single night of
course sometimes I forget but I really
do try to use it every night of course
we can't forget about our chapstick this
one that I grabbed today is by lip
smacker and the flavour mango and it
tastes so yummy I bought a whole pack of
these from Walgreens and I think there's
every flavor but the mango is definitely
my favorite next moving on to hair I'm
grabbing my argan oil and I'm just
applying a little bit right into the
palm of my hand and just running it
through my hair and focusing it on the
ends I do have a coupon code for this
which will be below as well but I like
to apply this in my hair especially if
it's been a day since I've washed it and
then what I also like to do is do a
loose braid and that's how I sleep
because otherwise I wake up in my hair
is a huge knot so this keeps it really
smooth and sleek final step of the night
is going to be my cuticle care cuticle
wax slash oil whatever this stuff is but
I like to apply this right on my
cuticles because I have abnormally dry
cuticles this really really helps and I
like to do this every night so my hands
are staying nice and fresh so that is it
for my nighttime routine
thanks for getting unready with me but
now it's off to bed for me I love you
guys so much thank you for watching and
I'll see you guys later boo boo so food
she's playing in a Sunday
first you starting
