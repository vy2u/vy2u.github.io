hi everybody thank you for watching so
today's video I'm going to be showing
you how to get this no makeup makeup
look and of course I'm wearing makeup
and by no means do I think this looks
like I'm not wearing any makeup but it's
a very natural glowy look and I saw a
lot of requests for something natural so
if you guys want to see how to get this
look please keep watching so to start
off this look I'm priming my face with
maybelline baby skin instant pore eraser
and you can just apply this with your
fingers just make sure your hands are
clean for foundation I'm using the
Loreal magic nude liquid powder and you
want to make sure you shake it really
well before you apply it and I'm
applying it with my Sigma foundation
brush and this one is one of my
favorites
next up I'm grabbing my eyebrow brush
and I'm combing my eyebrows into place
and then following that I'm using the
darkest brown color from my brow bar to
go and I've been switching between this
one and this gel one by anastasia
beverly hills but whenever i am in a
rush this is definitely my go-to brow
color setting my brows I'm using the
clear brow gel from Anastasia Beverly
Hills going back to my brow bar I am
picking up this lighter beige color with
my blending brush and I'm just going to
be adding a little bit of shadow into
the crease of my eye so for this look
I'm going to be giving myself a very
light contour and I like to just use my
blending brush and then pick up a little
bit of the powder just to get the line
where I'm going to be contouring and for
this look I'm actually using something
else to contour so stay tuned for a
little bit and I'll be showing you what
I'm using
for concealer I'm using my favorite one
by Laura Mercier and color SC 3 and I'm
applying this underneath my eyes as well
as on the bridge of my nose and on the
sides of my nose and everywhere that I
usually highlight
to set my foundation and concealer I'm
using the Rimmel stay matte powder and
I'm applying that with my foundation
brush all over my face
moving on to the contour I am using my
new Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit
and I am using the middle brown color
and I'm applying that on the sides of my
cheeks and on the sides of my forehead
also around my chin and blending it down
onto my neck
next I'm applying slight pink blush from
BH all over my cheeks
then mixing the middle and right color
from the same kit I'm applying that
right above the contour line and that's
just to give me a really pretty
highlight for liner amazing smooth color
by Rimmel and it is called
innocent
Tyler my Cupid's bow I'm using this new
bh liner and it's called star and i'm
also highlighting right in the inner
tracks of my eye
so your next step is going to be mascara
and if you don't like a lot of mascara
that is completely fine do as much as
you would prefer as for me I love my
clumpy long lashes so the L'Oreal
telescopic does that for me I apply a
bunch of coats and it makes them the
longest that they can be
you
I'm just using the first chapstick that
I grabbed and this one is from Walgreens
I believe and it is a lip drench
so that is it for my natural look this
is so easy and super quick to do and
it's a great way to really pull yourself
together
so this is the final result it is super
easy and super quick so for any of you
guys who are usually in a rush in the
morning I definitely suggest trying out
this routine because it's just a quick
easy way to throw yourself together and
give your face a nice glow so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and until next
time I'll see you guys later
just right there pillow
