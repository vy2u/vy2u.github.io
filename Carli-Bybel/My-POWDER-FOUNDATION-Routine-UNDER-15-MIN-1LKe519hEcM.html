today's video I'm going to show you my
quick and easy powder foundation routine
this is something that I do on a daily
basis when I'm out running errands or
I'm just out for the day as much as I
love getting full glam I love the liquid
foundations and all that stuff there is
of course a time in a place and I don't
think I show you guys enough natural
looks or daytime look so I just wanted
to show you guys this quick easy routine
for those of you guys that want to learn
how to use just powder because they do
say that a powder foundation is
technically better for your skin than a
liquid foundation so if you guys want to
see my full powder foundation routine
please keep watching before I started
this look I just applied my Mario
Badescu moisturizer all over my face
when you are doing a powder foundation
it's important to use moisturizer
because we don't want to start this
foundation on dry skin another important
step is to apply a primer I'm using a
mattifying primer if you guys have ever
applied powder foundation and notice
that you could see your pores a little
bit more this will help prevent that so
now this step is going to be optional if
you guys have darker under eyes I just
wanted to show you what you could do
some days I do this depending on how
dark my under eyes are so what you're
going to want to do is apply your cream
concealer right above the primer just
right under your eyes and I'm just going
to apply a little bit on the sides of my
nose my chin and in between my brows
because that's where I have some darker
spots so if we want this to last
throughout the day that is why you want
to do this so I'm just blending all of
that in with my Beauty Blender and then
I'm going to go in with my powder
foundation again if you guys don't have
dark circles you could skip this step
completely and just go right into the
powder foundation and then I'll show you
what I do to cover up some darker
circles later on so now for powder
foundations I have two that I go back
and forth with that I love I've tried a
bunch of others but these two just stand
out the bare minerals original
foundation and then the Tarte Amazonian
clay full coverage airbrush foundation
it really depends on what you're looking
for I've seen a lot of reviews on both
of them I find that the bare minerals
gives you more of like a sheen like a
basically like a glow where the tart is
a little bit more matte in my opinion
and it's weird because I when I went
online and I looked at some other
people's reviews I noticed that they
thought that the tar gave you more of a
glow as opposed to the bareMinerals so I
don't know if it's just my skin they say
if you have very very dry skin if your
skin flakes to maybe stay away from the
bareMinerals
um but again I approve of both of these
I go back and forth I always reach for
these when I'm running errands or I'm
doing anything during the day for
today's tutorial I'm going to use the
bare minerals because I just feel like
it today so I'm just dipping it into the
lid and I'm swirling it around I don't
want to have too much product on it you
can see it just has a little bit it
doesn't have like a clump from dumping
it in and I'm just going to start with
circular buffing motions
so again depending on how much coverage
that's how many different layers you're
going to apply I usually do two just cuz
I like a fuller coverage so the color
I'm using is golden medium and the color
that I use in tart is light beige I have
them in a little bit of a darker sheet
as well for when I have a tan but on
this foundation routine I feel like it's
perfect for people in a rush or if you
have school and you want something just
kind of really natural
you also want to make sure that you do
your neck so it matches so the next part
is completely optional I was gonna keep
this part out but I just wanted to show
you if there are people who like to
contour their nose even on days where
they're wearing powder foundation um I'm
gonna be completely honest eighty
percent of the time if I'm doing powder
foundation I'm not even going to contour
my nose but I just want to show you that
option for those of you guys that maybe
want to always do powder foundation and
then still contour their nose on top of
it so I'm using this heroine shadow
so if you guys are a lot younger and you
don't have dark under eyes you could
skip the concealer before the powder
foundation what I like to do next will
cover up a little bit of color but what
I need since my eyes are a little bit
bluish and they come out throughout the
day is I need to do that liquid
concealer before the powder and then I
go back in with the powder it's a powder
pressed foundation but I use it as like
a concealer so again if you guys are a
lot younger and don't have dark circles
and you're lucky you could skip this
step
so next I'm taking this Revlon pressed
powder it's a foundation powder and I'm
just gonna use a brush like this and I'm
gonna Pat underneath my eyes just to
really brighten it up and cover any
other darkness that you may have so you
guys don't have the darkness you could
either skip the step or skip the first
concealer stuff
so you could see it already I have like
a blueish undertone and that's even with
the concealer if I don't do the
concealer and I just do this that blue
will come out throughout the day so
that's why I do that
what I'm also going to do is take a
little bit more of that powder and just
go over that dark line and then brush up
and over so it just blends that darkness
in with the powder and it looks more
natural see magic to bronze up my face a
little bit I'm using this girl act ik
bronzer it has a really pretty Sheen to
it when you do an all powder foundation
your face can look kind of
one-dimensional or a little bit flat I'm
gonna use a little bit this it's gonna
bring out the highlights of my face and
it's just gonna make your cheeks pop so
I'm just using some of that on my cheeks
for blush I'm using this mac mineralize
one I actually just picked this up it's
called just a wisp
it's a gorgeous light pink shade and it
also has like a lot of shimmer in it
see it's very subtle and it just makes
you glow and I feel like this is a
perfect daytime look it's not too many
layers it's not too my steps it's really
easy to do I'm just gonna finish off my
lips I'm going to use the boldly bare
lip liner by Mac for lipstick I'm using
buttercup by gerard cosmetics and then
I'm just applying a little bit of
mascara so this is the final result
nothing crazy super simple super easy
there were maybe a couple more steps
that some of you guys can remove to
cater to your own skin but again this is
just how I prefer and how I like to do
it so I hope you all enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and till
next time I will see you all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
