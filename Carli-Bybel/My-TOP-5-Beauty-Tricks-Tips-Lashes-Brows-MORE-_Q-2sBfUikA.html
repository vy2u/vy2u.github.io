today's video I'm going to be going
through my top 5 beauty tricks slash
tips and I'm sure you already realize
because of the title of this video I
just wanted to go through some of my
favorite tricks that I do on a daily
basis I have mentioned some of these in
my earlier videos and some of these
tricks I've been doing since I was a
junior in high school so if you guys
want to learn what they are please keep
watching so my first tip that I'm going
to be talking about with you guys is
about lashes / mascara and I'm sure you
guys have heard that L'Oreal telescopic
has been my favorite I think I've been
using this since I'm going to say
sophomore year of high school which I'm
23 now so you could do the math but I
love this mascara because of the comb
tip that it has so this has always just
been my favorite it always gets it the
longest but one of my tricks that I
always do and that will really help make
your eyelashes look longer thicker and
everything like that is to apply your
mascara with a fan nearby and some of
you may be like well that's weird /
random and it's gonna make my eyes water
well no because if you have a fan on low
right near your face while you're doing
your mascara what it's going to do is
it's going to dry the coats as you're
applying them so I don't know if some of
you have used this mascara and realized
that it stays really really wet and as
you apply it it's not really making them
longer it's just kind of making them
thicker and some people don't like the
really thick lashes so the reason that
this works is because as you're applying
your first coat of mascara once you move
on to the other eye the fan is going to
help dry that first coat so basically
what you're going to be doing is you're
going to be applying a couple coats of
mascara and each time since it is going
to be drying it's going to help make
them get a lot longer so I dare you guys
to try this little tip out because once
you do you're going to be like holy crap
how did I not know about this and it's
something so simple and so easy and I'm
sure all of you guys have a fan or
something of the sort in your house that
you can use also I actually mentioned
this in another video and I said
something about you can do it in your
car so what I used to go to class or
when I was
my way to school and I was running super
late I would do my mascara in the car
and what I would do is I would put the
air up in the car and obviously I'll be
parked but I'll be applying my mascara
so obviously when you're driving I don't
recommend driving around and doing our
mascara because that is definitely not
safe but if you were parked and you're
in a rush the fence in your car will do
the exact same thing so let me know how
you guys like this tip it's something
that I've always done and when I get
ready I actually have a fan behind me so
every single day it's what I'm doing and
I love the results so for those of you
who want your eyelashes to grow try this
check out it should really help you 2nd
tip / trick is for my brows and I
haven't done an updated brow routine in
a while so definitely let me know if you
guys want to see that in my get ready
with me videos and some of my makeup
videos you guys can kind of follow along
to see what I do but if you guys want
like a more in-depth step-by-step video
definitely comment below and I will have
that up for you guys but what I recently
had just found that I'm absolutely
loving is the dip brow pomade by
Anastasia Beverly Hills and it kind of
looks like a gel liner and what I found
is that it's so much easier to shape
your brows and for those of you who have
thinner brows or maybe uneven brows and
you want them to be perfect and you
don't want it to look fake and you want
to look super natural my trick for you
is to use the pomade and use a thin brow
brush and you're going to outline where
you want your brows to go so say you
have thinner brows and you want them to
be a bit thicker you use the brush with
the pomade and then draw it on and it
will create the illusion of an eyebrow
now to fill in your brow I don't
recommend using this I recommend either
the brow bar to go which I've used for
two years over two years now
the dark brown color or I also have the
Anastasia Beverly Hills powder so
whichever powder you prefer I recommend
using the powder to fill in your brows
because it's going to give it that
really really natural look and the final
tip for your brows is to apply a brow
gel so if you guys don't use a brow gel
one thing you'll realize is that maybe
your eyebrows will start to fade away
during the day or it'll look kind of
like chalky but if you use the gel it's
just gonna hold your brows in place and
it's gonna give it that nice shinier
look so that if you're drawing in your
brows it looks more like hair so I'm
sure this tip would be a lot easier if I
were actually showing you what I was
talking about but for those of you who
do your brows on a day-to-day basis I'm
sure you guys kind of comprehend what
I'm getting at but again let me know if
you guys want to update a brow tutorial
so I can show you exactly what I'm
talking about but I was always just
using the powder and one thing I noticed
was that people were like well your
brows don't match your hair your brows
are too thick they don't really look
natural and ever since I've been using
the pomade and just outlining my brows
with them I've noticed a lot of people
were complimenting my brows a little bit
more so definitely try this trick out
the pomade is amazing and I can't
believe I live this long without it but
I will be linking all the products and
everything I mentioned on my blog for
anyone interested tip number three is
super important and it's something that
I've done forever and it's really funny
because if you go back to some of my
first videos I mentioned that if you
lick your makeup brush it will help
bring out the pigments of your eyeshadow
so obviously I've learned a lot more
since my first couple of videos so do I
recommend you licking your brushes still
probably not unless you're the only one
doing your makeup and you don't get
grossed out by that kind of stuff but
what I like to do in place of your
saliva is I use mac fix+
and you guys probably saw me mention
this in a lot of my videos a cheaper
alternative is also eye drops and I'll
just quickly show you what I mean
because when you dip your brush into
something wet first it really really
picks up the pigment and it makes it
look ten times brighter so for some of
you guys may be trying out some cheaper
makeup products that aren't so pigmented
try wetting your brush first dipping it
in the shadow and then applying it and
you'll be amazed at how pigmented and
how beautiful the color will come out so
that is my tip number three so I've seen
so many comments and so many people
asking what they could possibly do for
dry skin and one of the biggest concern
is that when you apply your makeup it's
a flaky looking it doesn't apply smooth
and evenly and I wanted to just talk
about a couple of different products
that I've used that I've loved for dry
skin and I think the biggest thing that
some people don't realize is that you
really really need to exfoliate so if
you're not exfoliating and you're just
using a face wash that's just kind of
like a soft liquid it's not going to
help you so the two face washes that I
use that are exfoliators are the B or a
pore unclogging scrub and the Olay
detoxifying pore scrub and both of these
have the beads in it so it's going to
help get rid of any dead skin it's also
going to help with your blackheads and
to unclog all your pores so that is
definitely a step that you guys need to
do if you're not doing also one thing I
really recommend is getting a brush to
wash your face and this one is the Olay
one you can get this right at any
drugstore and it's a lot cheaper than um
what's the other one that's out there
and you remember I don't know the name
what does the name of it do I know it no
I don't know it yeah I don't remember
the name of the other brush that's out
there but it's a little bit more pricey
but this one works just as good and it
moves in a circular motion so with the
bristles it's going to help get really
really deep into your skin so use this
along with your exfoliator and your skin
should feel really really smooth
afterwards another product that I
recommend is the Biore ultra deep
cleansing course strips and they say
they're just for your nose they do sell
these with the face strips and the nose
strips but I'll actually use the nose
strips on my face if I need to but what
I notice is right under my chin along
here I get a lot of blackheads and it
feels a little bumpy and sometimes when
I apply my foundation it's gonna look a
little bit bumpy err and I don't like
that I also get them a lot on my nose
and that's because I contour the crap
out of my nose so there's always a lot
of product and makeup and everything so
I like to use these maybe twice a month
my skin is pretty good so if you guys
need it more often I'm not sure how
often they recommend to use it but all
you do is you wet your nose or whatever
you're going to apply it you stick it on
when you leave it on for about 10 to 15
minutes it gets really really hard and
then you rip it off almost like a
band-aid so what's really cool about
this is when you rip it off we could see
all the blackheads and everything that
it pulled out right on the strip so this
is also something I really recommend for
those of you that have that bumpy skin
or you're looking to get a really smooth
nice complexion
so of course exfoliating and everything
like that is super important but also
it's really important to have a good
face lotion that you use in the morning
before you're applying your makeup and I
like to apply the lotion before I apply
any of my makeup even before I use my
primer so the two that I go back and
forth with right now are the Clinique
and it's a dramatically different
moisturizing lotion that's what it says
on it but it's really really nice and
it's light on your skin and I also the
past 3 or 4 months I've been using the
meaningful Beauty and this is the
antioxidant day cream and if you guys
saw what video was it my haircare
favourites video you probably saw me
mention the when and I had told you guys
how I was watching an infomercial one
night when I was like really really sick
I was up with like the stomach flu or
something
and I was watching infomercials and I
totally caved and I instantly bought
what I was watching the two things that
I saw were the win and then the
meaningful beauty with Cindy Crawford
and I'm sorry
after watching it with her and it her
skin is just so beautiful you can really
tell that she hasn't gotten much if any
work done because her skin and her face
looks just like it did when she was 20
so of course I'm going to trust someone
who looks like that at age 45 so I've
tried it out and I'm honestly loving it
I've been using it every single morning
either this one or the Clinique or
sometimes I even do like one pump of
each and I always tend to have really
dry skin in the winter so I found that
these two have worked really well for me
one thing that's annoying about my skin
is that in the summertime it tends to
get really oily so I have to go back and
forth with products so in the winter
time I'm using my dry skin routine and
then in the summertime I use a few
different products but we'll go over
that when it starts getting warmer
because I think today is like 19 degrees
which is not cool
so that is tip number 4 I know there's a
couple different products involved in
tip number four and if
you guys do have really dry skin and you
found something that works really great
for you comment below and let me know
because I'm always up for new options I
would love to help spread the word of a
good product that you've personally
tried and of course one thing to
remember is that we all have different
skin so some products that may work
better for me may not work as great for
you but these different products that
I've used and the steps that I've used
really helps make my skin smooth and
just flake free and really really
moisturized in the cold winter air so
moving on to my fifth and final favorite
beauty tip I wanted to talk about makeup
setting sprays and this is something
that I don't always show in my videos
because it's something I like to do
right before I leave the house and I
think it's super important for those of
you that are wearing a full face of
makeup to use a setting spray because
people don't realize and then a few
hours later they're like why is my
makeup melting off my face or why do I
look so greasy or why is my bronzer
coming off and it's something just as
simple as a makeup setting spray so I
always call it hair spray for your face
and the one that I've used and this is
my third or fourth bottle is the model
in a bottle and I have mentioned it in a
few videos I just recently picked up
this new one it's by krile Kryolan I
don't even know how to if I'm saying
that right but um it's ultra setting
spray this one I like to use when I have
like a full cake face and makeup once
you spray it on your face literally
nothing moves so it's a really really
great product and the model on the
bottle this one is for sensitive skin
and I use this all the time as well and
it's an amazing product I have tried the
Urban Decay all nighter spray and I
noticed that it really didn't hold as
much as I would have liked it to these
literally feel like a little mist you
just do one two three maybe like four
sprays and then what I do is I put my
face up to the fan and I'm like like
that until it dries off and you apply
this after everything is done and I
promise you like these are necessary
especially if you're someone who's
wearing a lot of makeup so that's one
tip that I don't show in all my videos
which I apologize for it's just
something I tend to forget
and I think most people do forget but
once I started using the settings breeze
I noticed how much longer my makeup
would last and like for any girls who
are going out dancing and you know
you're going to be sweating try these
out because you will be thanking me when
your makeup still looks perfect at the
end of the night whenever I go to IMATS
or beautycon I always get super super
hot and I think it's because I get
nervous and then like just talking to so
many people hugging everyone like I
always my nerves get up and I always
start like sweating so one thing I'm
thankful for are these sprays because
even though I sweat if I go to the
mirror and just kind of touch up with
some loose powder my makeup looks it
looks perfect it doesn't melt off ER
doesn't sweat off so that is it for my
