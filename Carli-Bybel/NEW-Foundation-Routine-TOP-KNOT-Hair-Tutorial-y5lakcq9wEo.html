No hi everybody thank you for watching
I'm sorry it's been a little bit since
I've recorded or posted a video here on
my channel if you guys follow me on any
of my social media then you probably
know that I was in Las Vegas over the
weekend with Brett Nicole and her
boyfriend Jeremy we had such an amazing
time and it was so great getting to hang
out them getting to know them better and
just exploring Vegas but now I'm finally
here back and ready to film so today I'm
going to be showing you how i got this
makeup look as well as this topknot hair
look and I know I've done a few bun
videos but the difference between this
one and the other ones is this one is
called like a top knot so it looks a
little bit more like I'm not as opposed
to like a big round bun
I think this not looking bun is
definitely going to be my go-to look for
the summertime because it's so nice to
get all your hair off your neck to be
honest so if you guys want to learn how
to get this look please keep watching to
start off this look I'm going to be
priming my face with my Laura Mercier
radiant face primer following that I'm
grabbing my Beauty Blender and so what
I'm going to use to apply my foundation
I'm mixing my chanel foundation along
with my BB plus and I'm applying it
right on to my Beauty Blender and I'm
just very gently tapping it all over my
face and I just recently started using
the Beauty blenders I've heard so many
great things about it so I went out and
picked one up and I really loved the
finish of your foundation when you apply
it with this so this is definitely going
to be my new tool to use to fill my
brows I'm using this brow pencil to line
them and I'm just filling it in with my
brow bar to go and then to finish off my
brows I'm going to be using my clear
brow gel moving onto contouring I'm
picking up this lighter brown color and
I'm going to start contouring my nose
I'm using this brush by Sigma this one
is for lips but I always love to use
this to contour my nose
grabbing this darker Brown cream contour
with my contour brush I'm then going to
start contouring the outer parts of my
face
using my Revlon age-defying concealer
and these two concealer brushes I'm
going to be applying this right
underneath my eyes and what I just
recently started doing was using two
different colors I'm applying something
with a more pink undertone right
underneath my eyes to brighten them up
and then later on I'm gonna grab my
Beauty Blender to apply my Laura Mercier
concealer right on the sides of my nose
on the bridge of my nose and between my
eyebrows and on my chin
next I'm taking my Mac powder in the
color medium and this Sigma brush and
I'm going to be setting my foundation
and concealer so while I was in Vegas I
came across this Luminizer that
everybody was telling me about and I
tried it out and it's beautiful so
tonight I'm going to be using it all
over my eyes and later on I'm also going
to use it to highlight so again another
reason I love these powdered
highlighters is you can use them for
basically everything and it really
really brightens up your face from my
new BH palette I'm picking up this matte
beige color with my blending brush and
I'm just gonna be blending this right
into my eyes and this look is going to
be very natural I really wanted to focus
on my new foundation routine because it
did change quite a bit but after that I
am picking up my wispy lashes by Ardell
and I'm applying them right on my eyes
and originally I wasn't going to use any
eyeliner for this look but with the
lashes it made it look a little bit
darker in some places so I'm just lining
the inner corner of my eyes with the
eyeliner
this part is of course optional but
after I did the mascara I thought a
little bit of eyeliner on top would just
finish off the look so I'm just going
over right along my lash line and very
very lightly just extending the tail and
following that I'm using this new
bronzer by BH and I'm applying that all
over my cheeks and just everywhere else
that I had contoured previously also
remember to drag this down onto your
neck for blush I'm using this new one by
urban decay and it's a really pretty
peach color and I'm just applying this
right on the apples of my cheeks using
the same brush that I use to apply my
powder I am applying the same Luminizer
onto my cheek
to lie my lips I'm using the colour
silly by Mack
for lipstick I'm using also by Mac it is
the Viva Glam and the color Nikki and
it's a beautiful beautiful color and I'm
not sure if this one it's limited
edition but if I do find it online I
will link it and then over that I'm
using my color your smile the lip gloss
and salmon and it's going to really make
this lip color pop
grabbing a little bit more about
Luminizer I'm applying it right on my
Cupid's bow to finish off the highlight
okay so now I'm moving on to hair I
think most of you guys know how to do a
tight ponytail but I am just slowly
smoothing back my hair and putting it up
into a high ponytail it's really
important to try and get all the bumps
down beforehand because otherwise you're
gonna have a thousand bobby pins in your
hair which I always end up having way
too many anyway but just try and avoid
as many bumps as possible
you
you
once your hair is nice and sleek here
then I'm going to take your ponytail and
split it into two sections like this
taking the first section I'm then just
gonna roll it and I'm going to wrap it
around my ponytail
once you get it around nice and tight
you just want to secure it with a few
bobby pins like this and then moving on
to the second piece of hair we're going
to twist it as well but we're going to
take it and put it over the first bun
and then wrap it right around just to
give it a knotted look just so it's not
so perfect and it's not so round we want
it to look a little bit messy and then
after we pin it into place you can
always pull apart your hair and just
shape it the way that you want it to
look
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video definitely leave
me suggestions on what you want to see
this month on my channel I have a lot of
new videos coming your way so definitely
stay tuned and thank you guys so much
for watching I love you and till next
time everything feels nice yeah you
bleed just to know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
