those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and it feels so good to be back
sitting here in my beauty room filming
for you guys today
I feel like it's been quite some time
since I have filmed I've been doing a
lot of vlogs and as you guys probably
saw I did a video with Drew so that was
out in New York City so I actually just
set up my equipment and I feel like it's
been almost two weeks since I've sat
down to film here so I'm really excited
to be filming the no mirror makeup
challenge for you guys today I had done
this once before on my channel probably
like 5 or 6 years ago I'm thinking so I
wanted to put my skills to the test
today and see how well that I can do
without a mirror so if you guys want to
see the no mirror makeup challenge then
please keep watching so I'm kind of
floating in the middle of my room I
would show you but everything's kind of
a disaster I am moving really soon so
everything's just craziness but where
I'm sitting right now I'm sitting
infront of my window because I love the
backdrop and I have a vanity over there
which I can't even see the mirror it's
like off to the side so I have a table
right here and then what I usually use
what I always use since I have moved in
is I use this little mirror and I have
it like placed on top of my acrylic
organizer right here so the last time I
did this video there were so many people
like you're looking in the mirror you're
cheating and I would never cheat because
then what's the point it's like a
challenge and I really want to see my
skills without a mirror so just so you
guys know there are no mirrors
whatsoever in front of me that I can see
I'm going to be taking this guy and
placing it right on the floor so I'm
excited I'm nervous I am supposed to be
filming another video with my sister
later so hopefully it turns out Dees
enough that I don't don't wash my face
and redo it alright so first I'm going
to use primer I'm gonna take the Natasha
de Nona magic primer
it's right in front of me so why not so
I'm really excited to test my skills out
today because I think when I did it the
first time it wasn't like horrible um
but I've learned like so many things
since then I do like way more layers so
I'm gonna try and do like a full face
for foundation I actually just got a new
Beauty Blender look how cute this color
is so I found a website that's selling
Fiona Styles foundation so I'm not gonna
kidding you I bought like ten of each
color that's how much I'm obsessed with
this foundation I'm mixing number four
and number five this should be the right
color I never lost my tan a little bit
just mixing it on my hands and then I'm
just gonna I'm like shutting my eyes
almost kind of helps and then I'm gonna
take my Beauty Blender that is damp
which is definitely gonna make
everything easier did I mention that I
got a carried in yesterday I think I
already did but so my hair is super flat
I always say I feel like a little
drowned rat when I get carrots because
it's like so flat and it has like a
weird texture because they apply that
keratin and then she blow dries and
straightens the hair with the product in
it so it has like a weird texture I
really should have worn my cat ears
today I couldn't find them so I'm going
on a very long vacation I leave Sunday
and I'm going to Morocco I'm so excited
I'm going for two and a half weeks which
is the longest I've ever been away but I
will be bringing all of my equipment and
computer and everything that way I can
film and edit while I'm out there so I'm
really excited about that so let me know
comment below what you guys want me to
film I'm away I figured I would do like
a makeup look while I'm out there cuz
I'm staying in an Airbnb um and then I
also of course I'm gonna blog and you
know just all that fun stuff I like it's
so weird doing your makeup without like
know where to look because I don't know
where to look am I trying to think like
where is the
make me feel a little bit more confident
can't forget the neck there's one thing
that is so important I think the
funniest part is gonna be contouring my
nose I don't know I do it so much I feel
like I could do it without looking in
the mirror I don't to get myself too
much credit we are gonna go in with some
cream contour so I'm gonna take my
graftobian warm palette number three I'm
gonna do this second to darkest color
just because I know this is gonna be
hard so I'm gonna do the tip of my nose
which it'll be the easy part
oh my god I can go like cross-eyed and
kind of see my nose okay and then this
is gonna be fun so we're gonna
I hope it's true
how's that is it straight I wish you
guys could tell me and then what I like
to do a while the nose is chillin I'm
going to use I guess light/medium for
concealer so this is the shirt sharp
heart-shaped tape feels like a nice
amount we're gonna blend I think the
beauty blender is gonna help make this
look a little bit more normal and I'm
gonna just try and keep moving my eyes
around because I think last time I kept
looking like up in one direction and
everyone's like you have a mirror I
swear I don't have a mirror so I loved
reading all your comments on my last
video with drew as I mentioned in the
vlog if you guys thought I was so
nervous going into it not because I
thought it wouldn't go well I just never
done a collab before and to do one with
a celebrity like drew I mean it was just
very nerve-wracking but she as you guys
saw she was so amazing and so fun to
hang out with and we got along so well
and I saw a couple people asking like
what sign she is she's a Pisces which
basically all my best friends are Pisces
it's like weird how many Pisces I have
in my life I have at least like six or
seven that are like the closest to me so
it's so funny when I found out she was a
Pisces because I think Libra and Pisces
like are just known to get along well
we're very similar so it was just really
awesome
so I'm so happy that I did it and I went
and I ended up being so amazing and we
formed such a beautiful friendship and I
just love her she's just so amazing and
she's as amazing as I had hoped she
would be well I'm gonna stop talking
because I'm gonna try and apply these
next to the creams turn the sides so now
I'm attempting to blend out my nose
contour keyword but someday like I
always start like down and then work it
up to try and cover
Brown should be funded by now and I had
like over two hours of footage so it was
so hard to cut it down I think like my
first round of edits it was still over
an hour so I had my mom and my sister
come over and help me like cut stuff out
because we just had such a good
conversation the entire time and from me
like every moment was special so like it
was so hard to like choose what made it
and what didn't
so they definitely helped me like cut it
down and make it you know viewable for
YouTube no one wants to see an hour-long
video I mean some you guys say which is
so cute and I love you for it but I
think majority of the people don't want
to see like a crazy crazy long video so
I hope my nose is oh I don't know if I
did the bottom it's like somewhat
blended remember if I blended my chin my
brows one thing I always do cuz I just
go over like I'm really doing what I
really do so once I blend the nose I
always just like go over right where my
bumps are on my nose like I have like a
weird bump on the side and I'll just
redraw it so I don't even know if there
was anything on that brush but I just
like when I contour my nose I like it to
look like my nose is contoured you know
what I'm saying so we're gonna say some
Ben Nye cameo powder I'm gonna blend out
any wrinkles
so I watched such a good documentary
last night and it was the second time I
watched it and when I turn it on I
didn't realize I had already watched it
and when I turned it on I almost turned
it off because I was like oh I remember
this but I was like you know what no
like I turned it on for a reason I'm
gonna watch it and I'm so happy I did
because even though I did see it it must
have been at least two years ago I'm
thinking I didn't really remember it as
much as I had thought and it was so
amazing I believe it's called
I am I watched on Amazon Prime it was
honestly a really like good reminder for
me because I kind of had like a like the
past few days I've kind of had like down
days and there's no reason I think
because it's almost about time of the
month over share but like there's no
reason for me to be feeling down like I
have so many amazing things happening
I'm so happy in like my personal life
and my work life and everything like
that so it's not like I was like oh
something happened for me to be feeling
say but I just kind of felt just like
hmm so like no energy and whenever I
feel like that I always like to watch
like documentaries or just like learn
different tools that have made me help
me in the past it just kind of get out
of that funk because we all go through
it and sometimes obviously there's
reasons for it and it's harder to get
through it but sometimes you know you
just have one of those days so when I
watched it it was by the way minis the
brow is by anastasiya I'm just gonna
brush these guys up I think one of the
main messages out of the whole thing
that really like stuck with me was just
to spread love like everywhere that you
go and the haters and the people that
are negative are always bringing you
down like those are the people that need
the love the most so instead of
listening to what they say and letting
that bring you down like just love them
just pray for them because they're the
ones that are like broken souls and the
only way to heal somebody like that is
through love and maybe they didn't get
that love from their parents or from the
family or they're missing it somewhere
in their life so my message to all of
the people that dislike me here that are
always the first one button here
disliking my photos my videos and you
know writing really mean things about me
I love you and if something happened to
you that you feel all that hate in your
heart I'm sorry and just know that there
are good people and if you open up your
heart you will let love in so I'm
sending all of my love and all of my
good wishes to you guys especially
because you needed the most and for all
of my supporters and everyone that is
just so sweet like I could cry right now
because you guys are just so amazing
like I'm sending so much love to you
guys as well because you guys are just
everything to me and I just I'm just so
blessed to have like such a great group
of people that follow me and then on my
page and then I get to interact with
every single day so I love you guys I'm
gonna try to do my eyebrows really quick
which I luckily like I said they were
micro bladed so I just always like to
fill them in a little bit more and I
think some people were asking like if
you got a micro bladed why do you still
fill them in I got the micro bladed that
way without any makeup it looks very
natural like I don't want them to be
super dark crazy browser when I wear
makeup you need to fill them in to
balance out the makeup so I wouldn't
want to wash my face and have like these
dark eyebrows like I have when I have a
full face of makeup on so that's why I
do that and same with the lashes I like
to keep them pretty natural and then I
can always add mascara so I don't even
know if I'm adding any color to them
right now I always like to like bring
them
then you just walked in Cindy hell mommy
with her makeup she can't see I might
just use like a powder this with I have
I've had this forever
it's the brow palettes from Anastacio
nice and even ball so I'm gonna take the
ebony and I'm gonna hopefully this is
hard but there's no mirror on this
shai community I deadly I think that's
as far as I'm gonna go with the brows
I'm gonna wipe away the powder come here

I just got the new lunar Beauty life's a
drag palette it's so big and I love the
colors in it there is a mirror so I'm
gonna open it this way to show you guys

this much so I can grab the color but
not look in the mirror and I'm gonna
grab sickening and we're gonna into the
crease I love how there's the neutrals
and then also it's super bright colors
as well same color and then I'm gonna go
in with the color and they want to do
snatch which is like this burgundy ish
Shay because it's pretty I'm gonna go
all out and scared
and we're gonna apply that okay I'm kind
of on the lid
see
you really don't want to do eyeliner but
I feel like I have to because for the
video it's like the hardest thing I
think eyeliner in brows I mean let's hey
maybe a little bit of mug and a little
bit more why not
didn't no idea what it's looking like
but hi Jay Jay okay so I'm gonna go in
with an eyeliner my chart1 dried up
because I use it every day so I'm going
to take the Too Faced liquid art liner
these ones are just I love the ones with
the Pens it's just easier for me
oops
try to a wing here oh I want to do a
little bit on my lower lashline so let's
take this guy no let's take the pencil
brush and let's grab let's grab that
snatched color again
then I'm gonna grab the lash warrior
mascara and fiercest black this is my
new favorite oh please no please now did
you get on me and then just used because
other words I always get black
underneath I'm gonna put a little bit of
powder and then I love for my bottom
lashes i always use here is the buxom
because it's just I like it better for
the lower ones
I can't use really any setting spray I
don't think today because my hair and
I'm gonna get away so while that is
setting I'm gonna use this palette I'm
gonna hold it this way so I can't see
them here and princess-cut and I was
gonna go over the nose
I'll take my original palette mine is
broken the other one and I'm gonna use
actually I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna
wipe this off first before I forget
about it
I'm gonna grab my condi foundation
powder I'm just gonna stamp it give it a
little bit more coverage you know I
wonder how it's looking I wonder if it's
like so terrible you guys are laughing
at me and I don't even know it yet and
then I'm gonna take my Beauty Blender
and this will save the day hopefully if
it doesn't look I'm just gonna take a
little bit more and just go over the
nose as well it's gonna be white calm it
down if it's looking too much - okay now
we're gonna take my palettes
hi chai and then you know what I'm gonna
take a little bit with my a little bit
on my lip too and we are gonna take this
guy and bronze up give him a regular
brush and this brush feels a little
stiff but lush I'm gonna take this one
doesn't have a mirror the nude blush
palette by BH I love
um through lips hmm I have like a bunch
of the flower Beauty lipsticks in front
of me see like this kind of looks
similar to the eyeshadow that I chose so
and I wanted to not use it nude because
nude is just too easy so we're gonna
first use the lipstick and I used to be
able to put lipstick on without a mirror
when I was like really really young
because I always had big lips so it was
just always easier for me I love these
lips if they're so creamy feels like
it's on do I do lip liner for fun maybe
a little bit
trying to think what else I would even
need maybe like a little highlighter
because I told you I can't use like
setting spray today because I don't want
to squirt my keratin so we'll just do a
little highlighter I'm gonna look now so
I'm gonna grab my mirror I'm scared oh
that's not terrible like oh this eyebrow
is terrible earnest look in my eyes
terrible so I don't hate that eyeshadow
Oh like look at the nose highlight the
nose contour came up pretty good
hopefully my bra was not the whole time
apologies I don't know I mean I think it
came out pretty good like this skin at
least came out pretty good the lips the
lips aren't terrible either I'm actually
pretty shocked in myself so I would say
besides the eyebrow which I'll zoom in
really quick so you guys can see I'm
honestly proud of myself so I'm just
gonna take my little beauty blender now
that I have a mirror we'll just fix my
brow because a little crusty what do you
guys think how did I do one to ten
comment below let me know his hair is
terrible so this is the final result I'm
so excited I challenged myself today I
want to say a little bit impressed I
must say but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video it was definitely a lot of
fun to film for you guys I dare you to
try it out for yourself I genuinely
thought it was gonna be way worse than
it was but what's crazy is that's how
much I'm used to doing my makeup routine
is even with no mirror and my eyes
closed half the time I somehow still
look like myself which is awesome so I
hope you guys enjoy that thank you so

forgot about the giveaway I will be
announcing that as soon as possible so I
can't wait but I love you guys so much
