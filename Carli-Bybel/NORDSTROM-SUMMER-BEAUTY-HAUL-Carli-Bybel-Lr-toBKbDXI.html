today's video I'm going to show you some
of the recent products that I just
picked up from Nordstrom I wanted to do
like a big cruelty-free summer ball and
show you guys some of the products that
I picked out as well as show you some
swatches and all that good stuff so if
you want to see what I picked up please
keep watching so as you guys know I have
been vegan for almost two months now
it's been going really really well I
will post like an updated video talking
all about it but it's been a whole
process trying to figure out which
products are cruelty free and which
products are not so a lot of my favorite
prior brands I'm no longer using because
they do tests on animals so when I was
going through some of the new beauty
products before the summer I wanted to
try out some Reds I've never tried
before as well as some Reds that I have
tried but I just haven't tried some of
these products out so the first product
that I saw was this setting spray by its
super goop so I've never heard of this
brand before but this is a setting mist
with rosemary and the reason I want to
pick this up is because it's a setting
spray with SPF in it it has SPF 50 in it
which is really awesome I always always
always use at least 40 or 50 sunblock on
my face when I go out in the Sun so
usually if I'm going out in the Sun I'll
use a moisturizer with an SPF in it but
there are days where we're out in the
Sun and we're where our makeup and we
don't really realize just because we're
not laying out in the Sun that the Sun
is affecting our skin so I thought this
was a really really awesome idea I'm not
seeing any setting sprays with SPF
included in
and I use it today it works really good
it has a matte finish and it sets makeup
at controls oil and it delivers UV photo
aging protection as well so again I
hadn't heard of this brand before I went
on the Nordstrom website but when I was
looking through the cruelty free list I
saw that it was included so I was really
excited to try it and after I used it
today I think I will definitely be using
this anytime I know I'm going to be
going out in the Sun so next I have
these two products I got them in the two
colors to see which one I liked better
it's the miracle body transformer
it's a tinted beauty balm it says that
it firms protects hydrates and
illuminates it also has SPF 20 in it
which is really cool last summer I
mentioned a few products that I was
using to apply to your skin to give it
like a really pretty Sheen and to just
kind of cover up any imperfections so
these are a cruelty free option of those
the reason I actually really like these
better than some of the other ones that
I have is they're not so shimmery so if
you want to apply it and just have like
a really subtle glow where no one will
really know what's going on like why
your skin's looking so amazing this is
definitely something that I recommend
the other products that I had used last
year were very very sparkly and they
rubbed off like if I was sitting at a
table and I lifted up my hands we'd be
all over the tablecloth so I was in the
market looking for a new one anyway and
then I came across these two they come
in the color glow and also the color
bronze the glow is a lighter shade
probably closer to my skin tone now it's
what I used on my arms and then the
bronze is a little bit darker so if you
guys have a tan or if you want to apply
lotion that gives you a little bit of
color you can use the color bronze lose
the bronze on my chest and then I used
the glow on my arms and I absolutely
love it
it gives you like a really really pretty
shine I don't know you can see I don't
even see it on camera when we are doing
our make
kind of like how I have my now it's nice
to add something to your arms and your
legs that way it all kind of flows and
looks really nice because sometimes if
we do our full face and our neck our
chest and our arms are kind of either a
different color or they're just not
looking as flawless as the face looks so
it's a really awesome alternative as
opposed to highlighting and contouring
with foundations on your arms in your
legs which I've seen all over Instagram
which I will never do that although it
looks really cool you can get that same
look with a lotion that's not going to
rub off and get everywhere and you're
not going to wasting your expensive
makeup products on bigger parts of your
body so I actually really really love
this and I love that it has the SPF in
it as well because the other ones that I
have used previously had no SPF in it
whatsoever
so if you want to wear this to the beach
or if you want to wear it during the day
you can totally wear this as well
I like this gorgeous scar right here and
I just had one little layer over it and
it covers your scar pretty nicely I mean
it's still there but this is actually a
burn from my curling iron so if you guys
are using a curling iron make sure
you're very careful because then you get
scars on your body they never go away
next up I have by polished choice
it's the resist hyaluronic acid booster
for all skin types this you can use
alone or you can mix it in with your
moisturizer it's supposed to plump up
your skin and smooth wrinkles so I will
definitely let you guys know how this
one works but on the box it tells you to
apply once or twice daily after
cleansing toning and exfoliating
dispense two to three drops and answer
your favorite moisturizer or serum you
can again use it alone or mix it in with
your everyday serum or moisturizer I've
been using this for the past week in my
moisturizer so I don't know how well it
works yet but I will definitely keep you
posted the next product is by Charlotte
Tilbury and this is actually my second
bottle of this one I was due to
replenish it I was using this all last
year this is absolutely amazing I
actually found out about this product
from this girl named Fonda who had
make up last time that I was in London
over a year ago it's called supermodel
body and it's also a body shimmer so
this one doesn't have SPF in it and it
is a little bit more pricey than the
other one that I mentioned previously
but I had to mention this because it's
so amazing this is a little bit more
shimmery than the other one as well so
it's really all about preference what
you guys are looking for you just open
it up twist it on to the on and then you
just apply it on your arm
well doesn't only ask for your arm you
can apply it anywhere you can pry it on
your arms your legs your chest and it
just gives you like a really really
pretty glow so I don't know if you can
kind of see the difference you just
please it a little bit and then you go
like that and then I like to just rub it
in so can you see kind of you guys don't
need to go out and find both of them of
course it's really just about preference
what color you're looking for and how
much of a shimmer you're really looking
for so I'm going to show you guys
swatches of the Charlotte versus the
miracle body ones and then that way you
guys can decide in any which one that
you guys prefer so this out of all the
products that I will be mentioning is
definitely one that I've used the most I
went through a whole bottle of this it
took me about four or five months to go
through a whole bottle so it does last
pretty long you can probably make it
last a lot longer as well next up I have
by Moroccan oil
it's the Moroccan oil Sun after Sun milk
soothing body lotion and it's not your
average body lotion this is actually a
spray so I'll show you so it's like a
really cold mist as it gives you their
last weekend or the weekend before we
were out at the beach and we weren't
planning on going the beach so we were
only out there for about an hour but we
pulled fry we didn't have SPF on which
was big mistake don't do that I was
really burnt on my chest you can kind of
see my tan line still I put this all
over my chest so you might not be able
to see it but I have severe tan lines
this was all bright red um Bret's
shoulder was bright red from our top
being open in our Jeep and I sprayed
this on both of us and it's just so
soothing
and I love how it's a sprite I've never
heard of anything like this until I
found this product but it soothes your
skin after you've been out in the Sun
whether you're sunburned or whether
you're not summer it just feels really
nice on your skin you can also use this
product if you have really dry skin I've
used this about three or four times
already and I'm so excited about it I
haven't had any products like this in
the past normally when I was somewhere
and I would just apply little aloe vera
which I was using as well but this is
really nice and just kind of spray on
before you're getting dressed in the
morning and it just soothes your sunburn
and your skin from being out in the Sun
I absolutely love it and again it feels
really cold when you spray it on so it
just feels really really nice so the
last product that I'm going to talk
about today I actually picked up a
little bit later than some of these
other products I went for a facial a
couple days ago and my skin just broke
out really bad I don't know what
happened but I had severe pimples on my
forehead and also on my chin and I
didn't know what was going on so I went
for a facial and she helped pop some of
my pimples and clear out my skin she was
telling me how my t-zone was very very
oily which I haven't been oily in a
really long time so I don't know if it's
some of the makeup that I'm using maybe
my brushes were unclean or I don't know
what was really going on so she'd
recommend this product for me so I went
out and got it some here at oil
controlled mattifier it has SPF 15 in it
but it's really good to use on your face
your neck and your chest so on the box
it says the oil control complex helps
regulate oil production while preserving
moisture to provide a long-lasting matte
finish willow bark extract helps manage
breakouts and clear skin of impurities
and are going to extract smoothes and
soften the skin so I've been using this
the past two days in the morning for my
daily moisturizer at night I use
different products which I will show you
guys again in an updated video but this
replace my normal daily moisturizer
because the one that I was using was
just like an anti-aging daytime
moisturizer so I figured I would switch
it up use this underneath my makeup so
my new current daytime moisture is the
hyaluronic acid
start mix in with the Murad oil-control
mattifier so so far so good
I've only used them for the best two
days so again I will keep you guys
posted on this but if you guys have
really oily skin and you're looking for
a good daytime moisturizer this one has
been amazing so far my skin has already
cleared up a lot since I didn't go for
the facial but I feel like I'm going to
be using this probably all summer long
just because for some reason my skin has
been super oily and I want to prevent
any more breakouts from happening I
don't know what has been going on again
I feel like I'm back in high school with
all these breakouts normally when it's
that time of the month I'll get like one
two maybe three and like random spots on
my face but I don't know what happened I
it just kind of like exploded all over
my faces there's some amazing products
that I picked up again I will keep you
guys updated on how I'm liking them
through the summer months but I am
really happy with most of the purchases
so far again you can find all of these
products at Nordstrom whether online or
in-store I bought all these online
because I'm just more of an online
shopper but feel free to go into the
store and test out some of the products
on your own so that is really it for now
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and until next
time I will see you guys later crying
