today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here this
is the look from my previous video I saw
a lot of people are requesting it so I
wanted to get it up for you guys the
eyes are really simple and natural which
it's really like my go-to look to be
honest and the lips I wanted to show you
three different lip options so it's not
just the one that I told you guys about
in my last video I also wanted to show
you guys how I actually apply it because
sometimes if you do it a certain way I
can come out a different color so I just
basically wanted to take you guys
through all of that so if you guys want
to see how I got this makeup look along
with the three lip options that I chose
please keep watching to start off this
look I'm using my mary-lou manizer by
the balm and I already did my face
makeup before the video started and I
applied some concealer on my eyelid
already so that's why I'm not using an
eyeshadow base don't mind this ratchet
band-aid I burned myself like three
weeks ago and it just doesn't want to
heal so this is the only family that
would really stay on because it's a
really awkward place at least the
matches my shirt
I'm also highlighting underneath my brow
next up I'm taking my BH party girl
palette and for the crease of my eye I'm
going to be mixing this shade and the
shade with this big fluffy brush this is
my e-40 Sigma brush
next I'm using my Kat Von D tattoo
eyeliner and I'm just gonna be lining a
rough draft of my liner before I apply
my lashes
I'm gonna finish my liner after I apply
my lashes and I just decided to do it
beforehand for lashes I'm using by the
lore these ones are the wispy sweet
nothings these ones are great I actually
just tried them for the first time two
days ago when I film my other video and
I really love them they're a little bit
less dramatic than my Carly lash but
they're still wispy my car lashes are
obviously still my favorite but they're
a little bit more natural for some of
you guys looking for a more natural
wispy lash um the code Carly lash was
only valid for my Carly lash but now if
you use the code at checkout it'll get
you 15% off your entire order so if you
guys want to purchase the Carly lash
along with a different lash you can use
just that one code and you don't have to
do separate transactions whenever I felt
my eyelash part I always get it out of
focus so I apologize um I do have a
video where I show you guys step by step
if you're having trouble applying these
lashes so I will link that video below
for you guys um normally they recommend
to apply your mascara first and usually
I do but of course I forgot so I'm just
applying my mascara after which is okay
I like to add a little mascara to the
lashes even though they say you
shouldn't because I like them to look a
little bit more bold so now that I've
applied my lashes I'm going back to my
liner and I'm going to thicken it a
little bit just to fill in wherever the
lashes end to make it look a little bit
more natural
so for my lower lashline I'm going to be
mixing this one and the darkest brown
shade and I'm also going to be pulling a
little bit of this purpley shade as well
focusing the darker colors on the outer
part of the eye
and then with a smaller blending brush
I'm picking up this dark brown shade I'm
using my Sigma e25 brush this is going
right in the outer V of my eye I'm just
very lightly blending it in
and then mascara for the bottom lashes I
did contour a tiny bit before the video
but I'm just going to darken myself up a
little bit I'm using the BH sculpt and
glow palette and I'm using this dark
shade right here
I'm going to take the middle shade with
this bigger fluffy brush give it a
little bit more of a bronzey look
ever blush I'm using pop apricot by Kiko
and this morphe brush
you
you
no band-aids want to stay on this cut by
the way I went through three separate
boxes of band-aids in the past couple
weeks and none of them will stay on
longer than like an hour so again I
apologize for this but gotta do what you
gotta do so if your lips I want to show
you three different options three more
recent purchases that I got that I was
playing around with and I loved the
first one is going to be Kashmir by line
Prime I don't want to tell you the
struggle that I went through trying to
get this lipstick but it is really
really pretty it does look different on
everybody um I like it more of a
brownish color instead of the grayish
shade that it looks like so I'm using
the lip liner stripped down which is a
little bit more of a brown color if you
guys want a lip liner that's literally
almost the same color as the Kashmir I
recommend using stone by Mac that is the
what I originally tried it with but
again it looked a little too greyish for
me I liked it a little bit more on the
brown side so I'm going to line my lips
with strip down
and then I'm going back in with stripped
down because like you could see it's
like a little more gray and I'm just
going to fill in the outer corners and
it's gonna give it like an ombre look
so this is lip option one
the next look is going to be using the
Anastasia Beverly Hills
pure Hollywood lip liquid lipstick and
it's a little bit similar to the
cashmere it's more of a pinkish tone
which I love and I'm applying this and
then I'm going to apply whirl liner by
Mac
so this is lip option number two it's a
little bit more of a pinkish nude color
I'm really loving the new liquid
lipsticks lately as you can see they're
great because they go on liquid and they
dry matte which is really cool so now
let's move on to option three so now for
option three I'm going to do the lip
look that I did for my previous video
that I posted I did mention below in the
description box what I use but sometimes
it may look a little different so I just
want to show you exactly how I did it um
I'm first going to be applying rebel all
over my lips this one is by Mac
lovey oh I know mine is too now i'm
almost done I'll come do it so next I'm
using cabernet lip pencil by Jordana
and then I apply a tiny bit of the
vintage liquid lipstick
now if I were leaving this lip on what I
would do is get some concealer and
because this lipstick gets everywhere um
and just kind of line right down here
because that's where it looks a little
bit like rugged II um I think it's
because this lip pencil I love the color
of it but it's not really pointed when
you have a pointed lip liner it's easier
to get a nice straight line so again if
you were going to leave this one on I
recommend just applying a little
concealer if it looks a little sloppy so
this is lip option number three and this
is the one that I wore in the video that
I posted two days ago so this is the
final result I saw so many people
requesting this makeup look from my last
video so I figured I would recreate it
for you guys and then show a couple
different lip options that are really
popular right now and that I'm
personally loving so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I love you guys so
much and until next time I'll see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
