for makeup for New Year's Eve here is my
second New Year's Eve look this is
perfect if you're wearing black or
silver or anything sparkly the first
thing that I'm going to be using is a
Maybelline concealer stick all over my
eyelid this is going to be used as an
eyeshadow base then taking my ELF
eyeshadow palette I'm going to be taking
this pearly white color and applying it
on my lid and also underneath my brow
bone I just got this set for Christmas
it's only ten dollars and I absolutely
love it the colors are awesome
I'm then taking this light brown color
third one up from my ELF palette and
applying this right into the crease of
my eye with my Mac blending brush
I'm then taking the second color off
this is a sparkly brown color and
applying this also in the crease of my
eye remember to blend this upwards then
using a small brush and this black color
from my ELF palette I'm going to be
applying this in the outer V of my eye
taking a mac blending brush and also
this black color from my elf palette
wouldn't be applying to my crease using
any object with a straight edge apply
this on the side of your eye and this
prevents any fallout from gunning onto
your face if you do your makeup
beforehand
next taking mac fix+ I'm going to be
spraying a little bit of this onto my
eyeshadow palette and I'm going to be
using this on my eyeshadow brush so that
way the glitter actually sticks to it
and doesn't end up all over my face I'm
using NYX silver glitter and my Mac
white glitter I'm going to be mixing
these two colors together
blow off any of the excess glitter and
apply this all over your entire eyelid
next taking the sparkly black color I'm
just going over where the black was on
the outer part of my eye
using my black Jordana eye pencil I'm
then going to be lining my upper lash
line
to line my lower lashline I'm going to
be taking a small angled brush and this
sparkly blue color and this is going to
go right on the bottom lash line
you can take any black eye pencil and
line the inner part of your eye
using a small shader brush and the same
pearly white color I had used first I'm
going to be applying this right in the
tear duct of my eye then apply your
mascara
if you want to add even more sparkle you
can take lash glue and a bottom of a
eyeshadow brush and just apply a little
dot wherever you want your rhinestones
I'm putting them right in the tear duct
of my eye this is safe for your eyes
it's the only kind of glue that I would
recommend using to keep these on on my
other eye I put two more rhinestones I
think it's fun if you want to just add
it onto one eye to give it a little bit
of extra sparkle
then by Revlon I'm taking this plum
color and applying this all over my lips
thank you so much for watching and again
this look is perfect for New Year's Eve
good luck if you try it out and everyone
have a very safe and healthy New Year
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
