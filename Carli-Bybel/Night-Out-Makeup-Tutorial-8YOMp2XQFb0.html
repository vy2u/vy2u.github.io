I'm sorry for the slight delay and
videos the past few weeks I was in
Tennessee and then a few days later I
was in LA so she's been pure craziness
the past few weeks and I got sick in
between all that so again I'm very sorry
but I plan on catching up a lot so I
have no plans the next few weeks few
months even and yeah so I'm so excited
to be back here today with you guys I
wanted to do a dramatic love perfect for
a night out I also wanted to quickly
mention that this month's issue of
women's health magazine I have a nice
little feature in there and I'm just
talking about basically a very similar
look to what I created right here just
some of my favorite products and yeah so
I was so excited that they wanted to
feature me this month so if you guys
want to go check it out feel free to do
so I still have to go later today to go
pick it out because it just came out
today so if you guys want to learn how I
got this Night Out full face makeup look
please keep watching to start off this
look I'm going to be using the color
kitten by Stila cosmetics
I'm applying this color on the inner
half of my eye
next I'm grabbing the color eternal
sunshine by lore'l and I'm applying that
on the outer half of my eye before using
both of these shadows I dip my brush
into the fixed plus to help really bring
out the pigments next I'm picking up
this matte brown color from Sigma with a
large blending brush and I'm applying
this right into the crease of my eye
I'm lining my eyes with a black gel
liner this one is called wicked by Sigma
for lashes I wanted to try a new pair
out these ones are by appeal and they
are called infinite with my pencil brush
I'm picking up this deep plum shadow and
I'm applying it underneath my eyes over
that I'm picking up the color Heritage
Rouge which is a Mac pigment and just
gonna really brighten it and give it a
nice purpley cranberry finish to
highlight under my brow I'm using that
same asila shato in the color kit in and
taking a smaller blending brush I'm
using that same matte brown shade
I'm just darkening up my crease
using my black eyeliner and a little bit
of my black gel liner I'm going to be
lining my inner lash line
moving onto skin to prime my face I'm
using this one by hard candy and I'm
just applying it with my fingers for
foundation I'm using my favorite Chanel
foundation and the number 70 and I'm
applying it with my Sigma brush all over
my face
to start off my contour I'm using my new
la girl Pro concealer in the color I
think it's bronze beauty but I will
double-check for you guys and I'm just
applying this on all the areas that I
want to contour
using the small contour brush I'm just
gonna be blending all that in so there's
no sharp lines and it's gonna give it a
nice faded look
so I'm using this brush to contour all
of my areas except for my nose I'm going
to use my finger since it is a small
area and I don't want it to go too far
down on the sides of my nose for
concealer I'm using the age rewind
eraser by Maybelline and this is just
going to go underneath my eyes once I
blend this in I'm also going to be
applying it in between my brows on the
bridge of my nose and also on my chin
okay so moving on to contour I forgot to
get a close-up of this but I am using
the new BH contour palette and I
absolutely love this one for those of
you guys in the market for a contour
palette that is a little bit more
affordable
once I finish contouring I'm just using
my foundation brush just to blend out
any sharp lines I'm grabbing my smaller
blending brush and a little bit of that
contour shade and I'm just gonna go over
the lines of my notes to set my
concealer I am using my Rimmel the stay
matte powder
and for blush I'm using why not buy
Revlon it's a really pretty dark
cranberry color
and to highlight my cheeks I'm using the
diamond glow powder and the color
conceded
for lip liner I'm using the color
Cabernet by Jordana
and for lipstick I'm mixing Mac rebel
along with my new obsessive-compulsive
lip tar and it's this new metallic deep
red shade and it's so beautiful and I
actually love how pigmented it is and
how amazing it came out
and the final step is of course optional
but if you want to add a little bit of
extra bronzer just to really darken up
your face a bit this is what I'm doing
at this point with a big fluffy
foundation brush
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video quickly I wanted
to mention this little gold tattoo that
I have because I've seen so many people
asking about them they're the flash
tattoos I actually have a 20% off code
off of the Princess Pea jewelry website
for those of you guys interested so I
will link this for you guys but yeah so
that is basically it for now please
comment below and let me know what you
guys want to see this month on my
channel because I love reading through
them and getting suggestions from you
guys so until next time I'll see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
