I I feel lovely just the way that I
hi everyone thank you for watching so
this video is going to be a little bit
fun and different I'm going to be doing
the no mirror makeup challenge and I did
cover the mirror for my vanity with a
towel I'll shoot you just you know I'm
not lying
um yes I covered it with a towel just to
clear that up just so there's no peeking
so I'm going to be attempting to do my
makeup with no mirror and it's funny
because when I was younger I was always
able to put on lipstick perfectly like
in the car without any mirror just
because I guess I kind of have a bigger
canvas so it was always easy for me so I
don't know how this is gonna turn out
I've never done my makeup without
looking before but we will find out so
first I'm going to be taking my
foundation and flying this all over my
face just gonna look into the camera
shut my eyes and try to envision my face
you're gonna be annoying I was recording
or I was thinking it was recording and
it wasn't recording humans have been
there I'm gonna make this really
difficult for myself and I'm gonna do
like I'm gonna highlight in contour also
cuz why not
so I'm going to be using this Mac prep
and prime to highlight and what I'll
normally do because I don't like playing
the dark foundation underneath my eyes
because when I highlight it makes no
sense to put a darker color if I'm just
to lighten it with concealer so that's I
in place of a lighter foundation I could
be wrong I feel like I might be good at
this
I watched a couple of these videos and I
know a lot of people I don't know if
they were really really really trying
but I'm literally going to try my
hardest make it come out as good as
possible so this is me testing myself to
see my own makeup skills if I can
visually visualize my face and just kind
of feel for the right fixity that way I
know God forbid a million times if I
ever go blind I might still be able to
do it
I already kind of filled in my eyebrows
because I just wiped all my makeup off
with a wipe but I'm just gonna pencil
them in a little bit more this doesn't
have a mirror on it by the way
now onto the contour so
probably the amusing blocks later they
should brush blend it a little back next
I'm going to be taking my bronzer brush
and the same dark brown color to contour
I do my makeup so much that it's like
really sad that I can kind of know where
everything goes it's kind of like
texting can you guys like text without
looking down at your screen because I
could do that
especially when I used to have the old
like the flip phones with the actual
keyboards I like never had to look down
on it it was weird but it was good in
school so winter teacher would be
yelling at people for getting caught
with their phone guess who never got
next I'm grabbing my concealer and there
is a mirror on here
but I'm not looking at it so I'm gonna
just look at the coloration
I like my nose Tim
let me go back to the same foundation
brush and blend because uh probably
then to set all this I'm going to be
using this loose powder by Ben Nye it's
the banana powder and
Oh
I guess next we'll move on to eyes she's
gonna be oh so lovely so I'm going to be
choosing by 120 make a palette this one
also has a mirror so I'm just going to
hold it down not peeking I promise I
want to do this really badly so let's
see I'm going to use light yellow color
and that's gonna be my eyeshadow base
for this one
you
and then with my big blending brush on a
pig which one do I want to use this dark
brown matte color
- I
I'm not too sure
I love this brush because even with your
eyes closed you just feel it doing its
job it goes right into your crease so
who needs a mirror I feel like I should
do a little darker to make it a little
bit more dramatic
all right let's I'm gonna use I'm gonna
take this pretty plum color I'm using a
smaller blending brush for this one this
is gonna help get the color in the
direct spot or not just have it blended
out in the crease so
go back to the bigger one grab some more
that yellowish color
okay um
just to be a little daring how about
adding some blacks to this look
go back to this little brush and we take
that same dark purpley color and ply
that underneath my eyes
now on to the hardest part is the actual
look um I'm gonna do some eyeliner now
this might be dangerous
I'm praying I don't lose an eye so you
shall see all right here we go
you
this is really this is honestly really
hard I thought I was into gopis that's
as good as that sighs get it
you
it feels good
oops I'm gonna talk too soon but I'm
pretty sure this is already coming out
better than regret but just a until I'm
finished I'll be the judge of that
good sure this part it's gonna be a
piece of cake for me because I do this
all the time without looking fun mascara
freak
actually heard that this mascara is and
discontinued which is just pure nonsense
so I'll keep you updated on that because
if it is stack up now um I used to have
the same type of mascara with the same
like wand but it was one of those double
mascaras I had like one end that's like
white it's like the white mascara that
you apply before the actual mascara
it's kind of weird that I can just do
this without looking like this I'm sure
it's like all under my eyes let me go
back to the spatula and just
you
and the final step is going to be lips
I'm using my 20 lipliner
that's right and then he's right coral
coral crush by Maybelline lipstick this
is piece of cake alright so I'm done let
me go
there's my dear I'm gonna see how we did
interesting some spare hair so I'll get
you give you guys a nice zoomed in so I
mean it's not horrible the eyeliner is
awful like if you look really closely
that's just not right but I mean I have
to get dressed in the dark or if I have
to get ready without a mirror hopefully
it won't be us scaring any small
children yeah so that is the no mirror
makeup challenge I would give myself
about a I don't know a B - what do you
guys think B - is that me being too easy
on myself all right
maybe like a C+ but yeah that was fun
honestly it was cool because you know
what I was shutting my eyes and
envisioning my face and I guess I'm just
doing her makeup so many times you just
kind of get used to where everything
goes so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
hope this was a little fun for you guys
to watch switch it up from the usual
makeup our hair videos I love you guys
so much and I promise be posting a bunch
of new videos so what do you guys want
to see next I am going to be doing a
