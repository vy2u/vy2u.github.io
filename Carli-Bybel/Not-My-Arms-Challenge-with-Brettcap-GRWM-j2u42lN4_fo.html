play it by ear and see how it goes first
I'm just gonna it's right here cause
itchy I don't even know what to say I
don't know what to tell you um let's
start with our makeup I guess or all
right so what I always like to do first
is to massage my scalp starts off my day
makes me feel alive
um and then I fluff out my hair because
it gives it extra volume just go like
this and shake it around and watch out
fluffy your hair will get I don't know
what to tell you about this move but I'm
gonna take you through this makeup look
get all my hair on my face and hopefully
begin my makeup
alright my hair is nice and fluffed now
just smooth it all out and then hug
myself you know I've been having a rough
couple of days I just need nice hug ah
bugs eczema how do I look nice and pale
ready to start my day
ready put some foundation on oh I have a
moustache fixed my rings cuz they're
falling off Oh foundation first
this one's chanel and he and I'm using
it in no I'm using it in the color 30 so
at least we got the right color going
today you just gonna squirt it on your
face put the cap gone and start rubbing
it around just rub it on your neck so it
matches your face
that wasn't enough just repeat it on the
other side and smear it all over your
face
hmm that seems like a nice amount move
on with some more makeup um never mind I
want to go back is the brush and now
comb my hair or my face so I'm just
gonna brush it out because that's what I
want to do right now so next spray
powder um um sparkles on myself this I
got from H&amp;amp;M
it's a curfew powder it's enough
and then throw it because we don't want
anymore that next I'm going to contour
with this contour palette here um smear
right on your face like a little black
with all the colors and then just
massage it into your face to give you a
really nice even contour sorry what she
knows that you hear um we really like
making the chin milk brown because it's
like a new technique I learned
apparently I have lice
alright no yeah so I have my foundation
brush and my blush brush which one
should be used both why not you have two
hands for a reason
is there any product on them no oh no we
can put any blush on it or play drums
rub my scalp one last time and put a
headband on
boom oh come on Hank bugger just keep
out of it oh lordy me like the hair out
of my face
there so now I might have been in hi
everybody
Hey hi let's move on let's move on hey
hey so now I'm grabbing my foundation
brush because that's what I used to
apply my blush
my ring fell off boom go so I'm going to
use this blush palette today it's one
kids you can see it out there this
palette Mac which color should I use
there's Greek boogers on my back I'm
gonna use this pretty orange oh I would
actually use a mixture of all of them
just put it on your foundation brush a
lot of it that's fine nice amount and
we're gonna put it right on my cheeks
hmm
just dab it on and sometimes on the rest
of my face tick
no no tickling allowed some more blush
on the forehead to give you nice
sunkissed glow
make sure it gets in there nice and deep
stamp that in
alright enough of that mm-hmm plymouth
girls slamming oh okay
let's not drop that one cause it's
expensive let's put that one down they
say yes thank you wave it like you just
don't care
you drive me crazy I just can't sleep
fluff your hair fluff that hair that's
what we do when we get ready hey next
I'm going to contour with my Anastacio
contour kit one of my Paves
this is it right here we usually use a
brush to apply it nope nope nope no no
we're using the wrong side and ruining
it yeah yep
use a mixture of all the colors and then
wipe it on the side that has no colors
then you take your nose huggy and clamp
your hair together it'll stay straighter
if you do this as well or you can clamp
em that's how you shut someone up and
sometimes our ear gets a little swollen
so we want to deflate it next I'm using
my Urban Decay electric palette and I'm
going to go with a really subtle look
and I'm gonna paint my face because my
eyes are not this is expensive and
you're just
yeah this is just not my eye you gotta
put eyeshadow on our eye
and the other eye
um not too much though guys don't go
overboard then we're gonna take the
blush brush and blend it on just start
looking really nice at this point so
next I have my bronzer I'm going to
apply this all over my face looking a
little pale lately so hey and since it's
a circle you can just kind of blend it
right onto your face and that's clearly
the only spot I need a bronzer you will
blend it in a bit um
once you're done smudging in the non
concealer that's not on your face we're
gonna use some eye drops
this is Visine you can get it at your
local drugstore um I'm gonna twist it
and put it in my face oh because
sometimes your face gets a little dry
and red and Visine really helps diminish
that problem and then the last step for
now is going to be to clip up your hair
so you can get some extra volume and
that is it right are we done what time
is it mmm
time to take a selfie before we end it
how can we forget lipstick we're going
to use this orange colored one because
that seems to be a theme careful it
doesn't spill in the carpet and this is
going to go on our lips
the wire if you mess up a little bit
it's gonna make your lips look nice and
big and plumb I'm gonna shut it up I
mean shut it screw the top back on clean
it off and wow it really really was a
nice final touch so guys that is it for
now
feel free to leave the thing on your ear
for as long as you want if your ears
super puffy
it'll help deflate it um that's it for
now I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
