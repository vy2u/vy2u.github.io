wanted to wish everyone a happy belated
Thanksgiving and also a Happy Hanukkah
for those of you who are celebrating it
I've always celebrated both holidays so
I got a few presents already this year
it's been a really really great weekend
I'm sorry I only had one video up for
you guys but I spent the whole weekend
with my family and Bret's family just
kind of eating everything in our paths
and yeah just a lot of family time so
it's been a really great weekend for me
and I wanted to send my wishes over to
you guys
also what I wanted to do was hold a
quick giveaway for you guys anyone
interested there's gonna be five winners
who are gonna win a $50 Amazon gift card
and this is just from me and Brett as a
little thank you for Thanksgiving and
I'm going to be holding a lot more
giveaways this month for the holidays so
definitely stay tuned for that and if
you guys want to enter the giveaway all
the rules will be listed below so
definitely check that out
this video is gonna be a mixture of a
couple different things I'm gonna make
it my November favorites and I also
wanted to mix it with some stocking
stuffer ideas because not only is it
Cyber Monday so hopefully I can get this
video up so you guys can get some of the
deals that I posted on my blog but
there's a lot of awesome new products
I've tried and they're perfect for
stocking stuffers or just some holiday
gifts so if you guys want to learn what
they are please keep watching the first
company I'm gonna be mentioning there's
two products so I wanted to talk about
both of them and it is Sigma and I
mentioned in my previous favourites
video that you guys had recommended them
to me and I loved them and I don't know
if you guys have been on the website
recently but they came out with new
brushes they have gold ones copper ones
and then I guess the normal silver ones
but when I saw the gold ones I was like
oh I have to have them I actually also
recently got the new gold iPhone I don't
know it's something about gold it just
makes it seem more cool whatever that is
but so I picked up the new Sigma set and
this is unreal it comes with all of
these brushes and then a whole other
side of brushes and I'm honestly pissed
that I didn't find out about this site
sooner because I spent so much money on
my Mac brushes and it's so cool because
Sigma has set so for someone who's a
makeup artist and you need all the
brushes it's great because you can buy
in a set and it saves you a lot of money
and for anyone just interested in
brushes these ones are so great and
today they're holding a 20% off sale so
definitely if anyone is interested
go check that out today I just got these
so they're not even used yet and I am
scared to use them they're just so
pretty but this one the f60 brush is my
favorite new foundation brush and
they're so comparable to Mac if not
better and I'm loving loving them right
now so I don't know if I can get this
thing back yeah I'm like afraid to use
these but that one is definitely my
favorite I also noticed that in the set
they have the duplicates that I've
mentioned from Mac like the blending
brushes that I use so that you have
those so basically they're exact
replicas of Mac if anything and I highly
recommend them it's perfect because if
you or you know someone who is in need
of brushes they have the sets and they
have the individuals and they're perfect
to just shove in a little stocking for
the holidays so another product by Sigma
that I actually just used was this
little mitt and it's to clean your
brushes I had posted a video and it was
actually one of my first ever videos on
how to wash your makeup brushes my
technique has completely stayed the same
I don't use any thing other than olive
oil and dish soap with back to
antibacterial stuff in it but what I
would normally do was I would just mix
the to brush it on my hands and then you
would clean the brushes that way but
after a while your hands would get so
dry and I would start getting like all
the peel ease on my hand so I mean it
was never a huge deal because I continue
to do it because it gets your brushes
really clean but then I got this cool
little buddy from Sigma and it has
different ridges so it says this parts
to wash this parts to rinse and this
parts to refine to have like shape the
brushes so I think if you guys have a
lot of brushes and you're cleaning them
a lot like me I recommend this if you
only have a few brushes and you're just
planning on using the makeup for
yourself it isn't a necessity but it is
really cool and I wanted to quickly
mention that so while on the subject of
makeup I wanted to mention the new six
color concealer and correct there are
palettes from BH they're really cool
because they come with six different
shades and some people may be like well
what do I use the green one or the pink
one or the yellow one for but the green
actually gets rid of redness as well as
the yellow and the pinkish salmon color
is really good for dark spots or dark
under-eye bags so what I like to do is
mix one of the colors
with the concealer and it gives you a
really nice glow and I love these
because it's convenient having all
different ones in one pallet the other
product from BH that I wanted to also
recommend for the holidays I did use in
I believe it was the Kim Kardashian
smokey eye from last month is the galaxy
chic baked eyeshadow palette and I love
this because the baked eyeshadows are
really really similar to the pigments
like the Mac pigments in my opinion and
if you use fix+ or even eye drops on
your brush before these the colors are
so beautiful and pigmented and I love
the whole idea of this palette so I know
a couple people were asking what my
favorite products from BH were so this
one the color corrector and then the tan
color blush palette as well as the 120
eyeshadow palette are definitely my
favorites and they're all under like $10
so they're a great steal and I believe
they're actually having a cyber monday
sale today for I don't know 70% off
which is just unreal so definitely go
check out that website I will be linking
everything below and yeah these are
fabulous so the next product I wanted to
talk about really quick was L'Oreal H
perfect Hydra nutrition glow renewal and
it's these little glow drops or they're
like little oil drops and you just put a
couple on your hand and then you rub it
all over your face and it gives you a
really pretty glow and I like putting
this on before my foundation because it
just makes everything go on easier and I
just love how it looks I actually gave
some of this to brett before he filmed
this video because it just gives you a
nice natural glow I've been using this
the past few weeks and I'm really loving
how it looks so far so I definitely am
recommending this for the holidays or
for my November favorites one company
and products that I will forever love
and forever promote for are the
lightening lightening products yeah I'm
sure you've seen them in almost all my
videos but it's so cool because they
always treat me in my fans the absolute
best and we always get the best discount
so for the holidays there's a new little
bundle and you're gonna have to use the
code sugarplum and what you're gonna get
is the dial a smile kit sorry that was
backwards the headless smile kit a zero
whitening pen a super booster whitening
pen the brow bar to go and you get Q lip
glosses you can pick whatever to you
like my favorite right now are the nude
and the salmon colors they're like a
matte gloss but they're very pigmented
so they come out really really nice and
you can get all of that for it's
normally gonna be $4.99 but with my
discount you get everything for $89 so
that's for anyone who wants to go out
and try all of the products this is
again a great stocking stuffer our deal
say you have five people to buy it for
and you just want to buy the bundle you
can give each person one item so
whitening lightening sugarplum as a
discount and get all of this stuff for
$89 or again I have the single codes
which I'll list below so next let's move
on to jewelry the first website I want
to mention is of course ludora boutique
that's where I got my earrings that I'm
wearing right now and they have all the
other earrings that I basically wear in
my other videos all handmade from Brazil
and you can get them all 10% off for the
holidays she has the most amazing
jewelry like the earrings unlike any
other second I want to mention the Alex
and Ani bracelets have you guys heard of
them because my mom and sister are so
obsessed they actually got me into them
on my birthday they bought me a couple
of them and then for the Hanukkah so far
I got a couple of them also and I just
love them I love them because they have
what's so called energy involved with
them so you pick out a symbol and
whatever it means and then it comes with
a nice little card and I keep all the
cards because it has a nice meaning
behind it and I really really love the
whole idea of this last year was the
Pandora bracelets and we got my mom
basically every single charm that they
had but this year it's all about the
Alex and Annie and I found these on
Amazon and they shipped like within one
day for my mom because I wanted to get
my mom a charm one so you can find them
on Amazon they have every single one
there I also noticed that the Alex and
Ani site is out of a lot of the biggest
ones like the mother one the daughter
charms so I will link the Amazon link
where I did get them and it's an Alex
any-any store through Amazon so it is
official and you don't have to worry
about anything like that but I just love
them I think they're so pretty and
dainty and they look good if you just
put one on or even a whole arm and yeah
these are so big this year and I'm
and the third website I want to talk
about I don't know if you guys remember
it's called Princess Pea jewelry and I
do have a code where you'll get a free
gift if you use the code but I wanted to
show you some of the jewelry that I've
recently got from them I love these
little like I guess they're the knockoff
Cartier bracelets but they're so nice
and they look so nice paired together or
even just one with a watch I also picked
up this gold chain necklace which is so
fab and I'm sure what it looks cute with
this outfit but I love this because it's
a little different it has that makes
sparkles on it so it's different and
again these are all really affordable
they're all like costume jewelry so what
they're super fun and the other one I
want to show you was this cool chain
bracelet with a pink accent in it so I
don't have anything like these but I
love love love all of these for
Christmas and the holidays as well
they're perfect stocking stuffers so a
great gift for the holidays in my
opinion would be this Bellamy six and
one curler these are awesome because you
get the best of all worlds you get every
single size wand and it has just a red
piece that they each pop on to so it's
super easy and it's awesome I do have a
code for this which I will be listing
below and of course without say I always
recommend the Bellamy hair extensions as
well I can't wait to get the new Lily
hair in I should be getting it this week
or next week so I will definitely do a
review if you guys want to see on that
but the Bellamy six and curler is
amazing and I always switch between this
one and my nume one but this is cool for
a gift because instead of spending a lot
of money on a couple different ones you
can get the nice six in one so if you
guys have been following Brett's channel
I'm sure you've heard him mention the
mate' fit brand they are teased and they
have different powders to add into your
your smoothies and stuff like that I
wanted to mention two of my favorite
products from them that I was a little
iffy about at first only because I don't
really like drinking anything hot even
if it's 20 degrees below zero and
there's snow on the ground I'll always
tend to get a nice drink but I came
across the metabolic boost from Brett
and I tried it out it's great because
it's supposed to speed up your
metabolism gives you a nice little
energy boost and it's super easy to make
seems to be a really great add in with
my diet and exercise plan so I wanted to
bring this up to guys and also don't
forget to go check out my channel
because he is posting new tips every
Tuesday as well as different health and
exercise routines that have really
helped me in the past and I know a lot
of people have been loving it as well
but the second thing from Mott safe it
is the goji blast and this is actually a
fat-burning powder so I put this in my
smoothies that I make I drink probably
three to four smoothies a week and I
always add in one or two scoops of this
it gives it a really nice flavor and it
says that it suppresses appetite it's
rich in antioxidants burns calories and
increases energy so these two products
are my two favorite from my taste it and
Bret does have a coupon code so
definitely check it out below
and that is it for my favorite slash
stocking stuffers for now if you guys
want more videos of more recommendations
for gifts or gifts for him gifts for her
anything like that definitely let me
know also make sure to check the
description box below so you can see how
to enter the giveaway again there's
going to be five winners who are gonna
win $50 gift cards to Amazon and this is
just a little thank-you from me and
Brett for being amazing and in honor of
Thanksgiving so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and until next time see you
