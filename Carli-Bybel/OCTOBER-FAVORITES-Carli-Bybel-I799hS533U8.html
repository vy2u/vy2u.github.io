today's video I'm going to talk about
some of my favorites from the past
couple of months it's been a little bit
since I have done a monthly favorite so
I want to update you guys on some of the
products that I've been loving lately so
if you guys going to get where they are
and then please keep watching so the
first part that I wanted to talk about
has been my go-to and just by the looks
of it you can tell so this is the graft
Obion cosmetics warm HD glamour cream
super palette so I've been using this
for my foundation probably those past
two months it's like the only thing that
I've been using I really really love
this palette and I'm gonna tell you why
you can see I use basically every shade
so I know when I had first recommended
this to you guys I said if you're not
doing makeup on other people or if your
skin tone kind of just stays the same
you can buy these in like a row of five
I believe so I feel like for me it's
always hard to finding a foundation that
just matches perfectly my skin tone is
constantly changing whether I have a tan
whether I have a spray tan whether I
just wake up super pale it's just like
all over the place I never really know
what skin tone I am so if I'm using like
a regular liquid foundation I usually
will buy like two or three colors
because I'm always like mixing them so
this palette has been like a lifesaver I
used it the last half of summer as well
as right now so I have literally used
every color and sometimes I'll just mix
a bunch and just kind of put them in
different areas and I just find that it
covers so nicely the product is super
super pigmented so a little bit goes a
long way so if you guys don't like a
liquid foundation and you don't like
anything too cakey or heavy on your face
definitely try out this brand it's
amazing next I just wanted to mention
these little things
our studio Beauty dual tip applicators
there for eyes lips and nails it says um
there are q-tips but they have a pointy
end and then like a rounded end there's
just so many different uses for them so
I really really really love these and I
just wanted to quickly mention them you
can pick them up at any drugstore the
next product that I wanted to talk about
is my artist Couture this is the coco
bling diamond powder if you guys haven't
tried their highlighters you have to
they're so amazing I really love how
they're like loose powder so you can use
them as like a pigment for your eyes or
you can use them for highlighters you
guys know I haven't really been
highlighting my cheeks as much I've seen
so many people being like why are you
not huiling you cheeks like what's going
on and the reason that I really haven't
been doing it is because I feel like
whenever I apply my highlighter whenever
I take a picture it looks like I put way
too much like white or like lightness
under my eyes and it like extends like
right here and I don't know just weird
on me in photos so that's the only
reason I haven't been applying
highlighter from the past like six seven
months on my cheeks but I always
highlight like my nose and then like my
Cupid's bow and like in my eyes and
everything like that so I'm gonna show
you guys a swatch of this baby but it's
so beautiful and it's so perfect for the
winter it reminds me of like a beautiful
snowstorm and it's just so crystal and
beautiful so I really really love this I
do have a coupon code for you guys as
well for the entire website so I will
list Apple so the next favorite that I
wanted to talk about is my skin ink
serum this is the serum I've talked
about this I think in another video this
is the custom serum that I created when
I was out in Ibiza I've been using this
for over a month now and I am obsessed
with it I use it morning and night and
then I also what I've been doing with
this and the reason I wanted to
is I like to apply it so I'll apply all
of my foundation and then I'll apply a
little bit on my fingers and then just
got it like underneath my eyes and then
I'll blend it in with my Beauty Blender
and that just like gives it a little bit
of moisture and then I'll apply my
concealer and then my powder and I've
noticed I never get dry under eyes
anymore it's weird because I'll do like
the same routine with the concealer and
the powder and some days it just comes
out like super nice and some days it
would come out like super dry so I was
doing the same routine the same process
and everything I just didn't understand
why so I just really your skin depending
on the day it could be more dry versus
another day where it's not as dry using
this underneath my eyes before my makeup
has helped me immensely so I wanted to
mention this one for you guys you can
get it right at Sephora and you can
custom create your own you take like a
little quiz and you talk about your own
skin and then they tell you what serums
they recommend so the next product has
been literally my holy grail this I got
on Amazon it's the premium triple cream
severe dry skin eczema care and it says
it's for babies it's from the makers of
triple paste that's what it says but you
can see mine is literally like empty I
just reordered this on Amazon it's a
very very sick cream so it's a little
bit harder to rub in but if you guys
have a really dry skin or your eczema is
really bad like me this product has been
amazing I have tried literally every
single product and I found a lot that I
really liked but my eczema you guys know
I've talked about a little over the
summer I was the worst it's ever been my
entire life like towards the end of
summer so I had read something on
Pinterest about this product right here
I got it and I've been using that since
I would say like August maybe like end
of July and I've noticed my eczema has
gone a lot better now this could be for
other reasons but I haven't really
changed anything else in my diet as
as I was taking it was soy or I was
thinking it was like something that I
was eating but I really haven't changed
my diet and I was just using this and I
noticed that my eczema has cleared up a
lot it's still not gone but it's
definitely more manageable which is all
that I can ask for because it got to a
point where I was miserable every single
day and finally I'm at a point where
it's like uncomfortable but I can manage
I can deal with it so this I highly
recommend and the fact that it's made
for babies just lets you know that
there's no bad ingredients or anything
in it that's gonna hurt or harm your
skin so while we're still on the subject
of skincare I recently went back to this
image skincare vital see hydrating
Repair Cream I'm sure I mentioned this
like a year or two ago I haven't gone
and probably like three or four months
but where I go and get my facials this
is the brand that they carry there and
it's the brand that they use when
they're giving the facials there and
this literally just is the most
refreshing smell ever it smells like
oranges and just smells like summertime
it's just super fresh um I didn't
realize that I had another piece of
these in my drawer I have like a
skincare drawer and who is over oh and
when Nicole was here from Florida we
were doing like masks and I found this
lotion in that draw and I was at home I
got I didn't know I had another one I
love this lotion it's good for daytime
or nighttime I usually will use this at
nighttime I have a couple other ones
that all I switch up between before I
apply my makeup but this has been like
my go-to night cream the next product I
think I picked these up at Namie's of
wild oh they are the to go spa eyes
refreshing iced water eyes so this one
soothes moisturizes and d-cups tired
eyes so it comes with three treatments I
only have one left in here I use the two
and I really really love these and let
me tell you why I have used a bunch of
those little pants that go on your eyes
which I really love but a lot of them
like slip off so you have to like kind
of like lay back with your head bag
while you're wearing them me Nicole
we're doing face masks I'm going to use
these and they just literally
right on our face so like we were doing
things around the house and moving
around and they didn't move so it was
cool to just have something stay on
their face with the mask that way I
didn't have to kind of like lay down and
do nothing you could still like do
things for the half hour that you're
supposed to keep them on and I just
really love how they mean my eyes feel I
don't really ever see like instant
results from stuff like this but if
you're having like a little pamper day
and you're doing your face mask try
these out or try something similar to
these because they just make your eyes
feel like super nice and really cool
afterwards speaking of cool afterwards
where is that product I recently picked
up this milk makeup cooling water or
gels and I'm pretty sure you can use it
like all over your face but I'll use
this like underneath my eyes after I
wash my makeup off if you apply it like
on you you go to Sephora like test it
out it's just like instantly like super
cool and it's just like a very thin gel
but when I was in support I hadn't tried
any of the milk products so I figured
let me swatch this it felt really nice
on my hand and I've been using it and I
really have been loving it anything that
sounds like cooling or refreshing like I
always love to try it for my face
because I just love how that feels like
when you have a fresh face and like some
nice products on there's nothing better
than that in my opinion so I've been
loving this as well so the next product
that I wanted to talk about is this
little fellow right here this is the
artis elite circle 1r brush I've been
using this every single time to contour
my nose normally I would just like use
my fingers and then kind of blend it out
but I just found this makes it look so
much more real and it just makes it a
lot easier and more like smooth and like
even throughout like I used to spend way
too much time on my nose like I blend it
out and then go over it again and then
blends it
I wanted it all to be like even and what
this broad just makes it so much easier
I'm almost positive they sell these
individually I know I got mine as a kit
but I will look for you guys I'm pretty
sure I have to sell them individually
though only make sense the next part
that I wanted to talk about I feel like
I may have mentioned this in a favors
video like a year or so ago but I
haven't used it and I actually couldn't
even find it until recently so for my
birthday I ended up getting a spray tan
um the last time that I did a spray tan
was in August for my meet up at Ulta and
after that my skin went nuts so no my
best friend was spray tans me she said
that's it I'm not spraying you anymore
like obviously it's affecting your skin
blah blah blah blah blah so like I had
to beg her I'm like it's my birthday I
really wanna be tan like please just
bring me I will deal with the
consequences whatever so she ended up
spraying me but I also like to do
whenever I have a spray tan as I fly
like a body bronzer like glittery
bronzer to make you like look super
shimmery but the one thing that I hate
the most about that is like when you
lean on things or you hug somebody like
instantly like comes right off and gets
everywhere so this stuff is amazing if
you're ever applying um like a shimmery
bronzer or if you just get a spray tan
you wanna put your clothes on and not
ruin anything it's called the ultra
drying body shimmer it's my tan in the
raw and it's most super good but I just
use like a big fluffy brush and I just
like circle it all over my body wherever
I feel sticky and then it just mattifies
it and then it prevents it from like
rubbing off on everything so the next
thing that I wanted to talk about with
this little comb so this is a coal made
out of real wood I got this on Amazon
and the reason I picked this up I don't
know if you guys follow me on snapchat
but I think it was like three weeks ago
I was watching this documentary on
indigo children if you guys don't know
anything about it you should
because it's super interesting and I
1,000,000% believe in that I believe in
all of that kind of stuff and after I
watch this documentary I was like on
YouTube I got like lost watching all
kinds of things about like indigo
children and crystal children and all
that stuff and there was this one girl
who had like really really really long
hair and she was just talking about all
these benefits about using a real wooden
comb to brush out your hair and I'm not
gonna like get into all the things she
was saying because I know half of you
guys are gonna just be like you're crazy
like what are you talking about so she
had recommend using this comb for ten
minutes a day five minutes in the
morning five minutes at night so I've
been using it I haven't done it like ten
minutes every single day but this is the
brush that I've been using to brush out
my hair so this is my new comb wanted to
talk about it super cool you can get on
Amazon for like five six dollars or
something like that but yeah I'm gonna
list below the video that I watched and
if any of you guys want to watch it
check it out tell me what you think let
me know what you're thinking and last
but not least the last pack that I'm
going to talk about today is by Drybar I
got like the little sample versions this
one it's the sparkling soda shine mist
which I absolutely love especially if
you are doing your hair straight like if
you can see like my hair is really
really shiny when you spray this on it
just makes it like shinier I don't know
if you couldn't even like tell but like
you just see like super shiny so I got
this in the sample version I love it um
I also got the three-in-one texture
spray in a sample version like a year
ago and then I ended up buying the
bigger version because it's one of my
favorites I love the dry part products
and they're all cruelty free which is
also amazing I know this is like random
but I saw a couple people requesting how
I shave my hair video and I know it's
like super simple but I actually found
this new tool that I've been using a lot
and it helps really keep my hair
straight I always used to like mist
pieces especially right in the back
so I mean oh if you guys want to see
like a hair straightening video I don't
know if that'll be boring but I feel
like for some people it might be helpful
so definitely let me know but yeah I
think that's it as far as my favorites
for the past like month or two oh I
missed one how could I even forget this
one by Julie cosmetics I just recently
got this it was still impossible to get
it's a citroen highlighter and I got
this highlighter from Nicole Guerrero so
she was here for my birthday and she
ended up highlighting me she ended up
highlighting Nicole and also my cousin
Danny because she was applying this on
her cheeks and I was literally like
blinded I was like what highlight is
this I need it in my life and on my
birthday I actually wore highlighter on
my cheek which I just talked about how I
haven't done it but she just made it
look so good that I was like I need it
in my life
so this highlighter is amazing I think
it's sold out online but I'm going to
check everywhere and then if I find it
I'll link it for you guys but it's just
such a gorgeous color I'm going to
swatch it so you can see it but it's
just so beautiful and it's so pigmented
and I had to mention it now I'm actually
done that is it for my monthly favorites
