hi everyone thank you for watching so
it's been quite a bit since I've done a
favorites video and I want to start
hopefully doing these every single month
of course if you guys want to see them
so for the month of October I did a lot
of shopping not only because it was my
birthday but because fall has finally
arrived here in New Jersey and I bought
all kinds of new goodies so I just
really quickly wanted to go through a
couple of the things that I bought and
some of my favorites for the month of
October so if you guys want to learn
what they are please keep watching
this
so the first thing I'm going to mention
is something food-related and I need to
put it back in the fridge so I wanted to
talk about it first
the Chobani Greek yogurts the vanilla
ones these ones they have called golden
crunch in them but it's like this little
like maybe all of stuff that they have
on this side and what you do is you just
tip it over and pour it into the yogurt
and when I tell you these are the most
amazing yogurts ever I eat like two of
these a day they're so good and they're
great for a quick snack or even for
breakfast or something like that and I
just wanted to tell you guys about these
because every time I go to the store
they're always almost sold out so I know
that they're really popular right now
plus they're healthy so I wanted to just
mention those because I found them in
this past month if you guys have watched
some of my most recent makeup tutorials
you probably see me mention the velour
lashes and I came across these when I
was at the Vancouver IMATS and I have
all different types of brands of lashes
that I do love but these ones are
definitely my favorite they are a little
bit more pricey but you do get like 25
layers out of them they are made with a
hundred percent mink hair but no animals
whatsoever were harmed in the process so
I just wanted to throw that out there
because I saw a couple of people
concerned about that so do not worry no
one is harmed during making these lashes
but they are amazing quality and I do
back them up a hundred percent so one of
the worst things is getting razor burn
so I was looking for a product that I
can use that's gonna help prevent that
and also like help medicate it in a way
I came across this bikini zone and it's
a medicated cream that you put on for
any razor burn or anything like that and
it really really helps and I also use
this underneath my armpits if I get any
razor burn as well because usually
wherever the coarsest hair is that's
where you tend to get the razor burn so
this again you can get any drugstore and
I like it because it feels like it's
working and it has been working for me
this past month in the beginning of
October I placed another order through
Amazon for my model and a bottle I
always get the one for sensitive skin
because I do have sensitive skin and
this stuff is really amazing I've tried
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray also I've tried mac fix+ as a
setting spray but this one is the only
one that I think works the best and
actually does what it's supposed to do
I swear whenever I'm
and I know it's gonna be a long night I
always apply this and I absolutely love
it so I did use it way before October
but I just placed another order recently
and as you can see it's already almost
halfway done because this is just
amazing and for girls like me who love
to wear lots of makeup this is gonna
help you I like to call it hair spray
for your face so moving on to some
fashion stuff these rings I've worn
every single time I've gone out lately
and if you've seen my recent blog post
you've seen me link them these are from
ASOS they came in like a twin pack and
they're so perfect they're awesome and I
like it because if I just want to throw
on a couple of rings I just put one on
each hand and since they are like bulky
and thick you don't really need any
other rings with it I think it looks
really really cool and these were very
inexpensive and I also have a coupon
code for ASIS for 15% off that is valid
today until I believe Saturday I will be
posting all the details below but I was
so excited when they offered me a coupon
code for you guys exclusively for my
followers because that is one of my
favorite stores and I know they don't
really do a lot of discounts on there so
definitely take advantage of it while
the coupon is still active so the next
product I'm going to talk about I
actually did recently reorder it that's
why I want to talk about it and I never
talked about it because I was always a
little unsure of it but I've been using
these little nose clips and it's funny
because I swear I used it almost every
single day and when me and Brett first
start dating I didn't use it for a while
because I was like this kid's gonna
think I'm a weirdo like sitting there
with this thing on my nose and they're
called like nose Huggies you can get
them on Amazon they're like two dollars
and when I tell you I literally wear
this every single day and I mean a lot
of you vest if I got a nose job but I
mean come on if I got a nose job my nose
would look a lot better than this so
really quickly I'm gonna call my mom
just she's gonna be proof that I really
do use this so hold on one second
she better answer
work
hi hi moms hi Papa lupus nothing um so
I'm filming this favorites video and I
just have a question for you sure so
what did I used to when I would sit in
my room and used to come up and make fun
of me what always used to be on my face
yeah I used to always have something on
my face that I swear up and down works
yeah because I'm filming right now
talking about it and I just wanted to
prove to them that I really did wear it
all the time so I just wanted to call
you so you can say it cuz you're on
camera right now so say hi bye I don't
to get her in trouble but yeah see I
really do wear this I've worn it for
like a year and I think it works and I
personally approve of it so if you guys
want to try it out I mean it's not gonna
make a huge difference but I mean it's
common sense if you just put something
on the tip of your nose it's gonna
tighten it for a little bit and that I
mean I guess it goes away but I love it
and I just reordered a new one because
it seems like this one's a little bit
more high-tech now so I'll link this
below as well if anyone wants to try it
out but they are pretty awesome and I
personally love them so now that fall is
officially here I bought a bunch of new
boots and I wanted to show you a couple
of them because they're amazing and I
love them and these are the first pair
they're little ankle booties and they're
perfect
with just a pair of jeans or anything
like that I'm absolutely in love with
them and I love just like the easy
little booties with a cute little heel
because it gives you some height and
they're actually really really
comfortable these second pair are from
forever 21 I actually just got them
let's see how much they were there are
only 32 dollars so these ones are so
cute they're just plain black with a
little heel and again they're ankle
booties so I thought these would look
great with any kind of outfit that you
can make
casual are a little bit fancier so I
loved these and I believe they're still
on the website so I wanted to show you
guys all these well hopefully they're
all still available the next pair these
are definitely a knockoff of those Cloe
boots but these are the ankle boots and
they have nice gold studs all over them
and I found these on Amazon for $30 like
$30 you kidding me instead of a thousand
$30 I'd rather pay $30 so I'm gonna look
for the length to post for you guys as
well but I just thought these were so
adorable the pair of black pants
anything like that
I think it'd look great another pair
that I picked up from forever 21
are these taupe colored over the knee
boots they're so cute on I love them and
I'm loving over the knee boots this year
I've always loved over the knee boots
but I picked up a couple pairs with an
actual heel on it because since my legs
are pretty short because I'm only five
foot two and a half it really cuts off a
lot of your leg
so one with a little heel on it is
perfect I got them the last week in
October so I'm assuming that they're
still available but again everything
that I do mention in this video I will
be listing with direct links if they are
still available the final two products
I'm gonna be talking about today I got
about two weeks ago this is the purse
and it's so adorable it's gray and black
and it has this little buckle right here
this is also from ASOS it's only listed
at $30 so it's a very very inexpensive
bag and it's named the Carley bag so I
was like are you kidding me it's the
name of the Carley bag and it's only $30
I obviously have to get in both colors
let me show you the other color this is
the other color which is so amazing my
mom wants them both as well but $30 plus
for two days you have that 15% off code
so anyone interested in them definitely
go check out the site because such a
great deal and I mean $30 pretty awesome
so I don't know if you guys follow my
fashion Instagram at the Fashion Bible
but I had shown a picture of my
Starbucks drink and I like to get the
iced venti nonfat to pama's pumpkin
spice Lite iced chai and I just really
quickly wanted to share with you guys
because it is one of my definite October
favorites I drink it almost every single
day and I'm sure it's not the best for
you but sometimes you just deserve a
treat every once in a while so this is
my favorite drink I just wanted to
quickly add that in so for now that is
all for my October favorites I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and again make
sure to click like if you want more
favorites videos because it's cool kind
of going through all different products
from beauty makeup fashion all that kind
of stuff so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and until next time I'll see you
