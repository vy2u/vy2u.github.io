today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this emerald green smokey eye I
did a very similar look when I was in
Malaysia for an award show and I know a
lot of people had requested it then and
I was looking through shadow colors
today I trying to figure out what kind
of look I wanted to do and I was just
drawn to the green so if you guys want
to see how I got this look right here
then please keep watching so for today's
look I am using the infamous honest Asya
Beverly Hills subculture palette I
wanted to try it out for myself because
I really really do love the colors so I
am first picking up the color destiny
with my blending brush and I'm applying
that into my crease I experienced no
fallout on my face when using this
palette the key is just to dip your
brush in once or twice and build as you
go that's what I always do with every
other palette so just a little tip I'm
also trying out the new Sephora Pro
palette I'm picking up this bright
orange shade and I'm applying that right
above the green color that I applied in
my crease I'm then picking up the single
shadow called emerald by anastasiya as
well and I'm applying that right below
where I apply that matte shadow and I'm
going to start dragging it down onto my
eyelid
next I'm picking up the color untamed
and I'm blending that into my crease as
well and then I'm picking up a little
tiny bit of the color rowdy and I'm
applying that in the outer V and this is
just going to give my eyes some more
depth so I really had no issues with
this palette maybe they are not as
pigmented on the eye so so far so good I
am going in with a little bit of
concealer and I'm going to apply that on
the inner part of my eyelid basically
like the inner half and then I'm going
to pick up this beautiful green shade
from the same Sephora Pro palette and
apply that over where I applied the
concealer so I also really like the pro
palette so far as well from the very few
shades that I did use I would say the
orange maybe didn't blend that well but
I ended up making it work in the end so
although it looks a little strong maybe
this close up you'll see that in the end
it all ends up coming together so I'm
picking up a little bit of the color
electric and I'm applying that right
over that other green shadow I'm picking
up a little bit of the color new wave
and I'm blending that from the darker
green up into that orange shade I
probably could have just used this but I
wanted more of like an orange tone so
that's why I ended up mixing it so I'm
picking up a little bit more of untamed
with a smaller blending brush and I am
just blending the lid color into the
crease color then I'm picking up the
color white gold and I'm applying that
right along my brow bone just to
highlight a little bit and then also
kind of diffuse the orange yellow a
little bit as well so I'm going back in
with the color untamed and I'm just
blending it a little bit more into my
crease
for liner I'm using the Charlotte
Tilbury feline flick this is definitely
my favorite at the moment and I'm going
to do a regular wing
I'm picking up the color electric and
I'm applying that right into my tear
ducts as well to highlight and then I'm
just going to grab a makeup wipe and
clean up the edges for lashes I'm using
the iconic light by house of lashes and
then I'm going back in with destiny and
untamed and I'm going to be applying
that right on my lower lash line I'm
just mixing them together and I'm going
to blend it as best as I can for now and
then I'm going in with that hot orange
shade and I'm blending that right below
it I always like to do a super thick
lower lash line because I feel like it
makes my eyes look rounder for mascara
I'm using this one by Tarte and then I'm
going to be doing my little mascara hack
where I apply powder underneath my eyes
before applying my lower mascara and
that helps prevent any darkness or any
black from smudging onto my under eyes
and then I'm just applying a little bit
of this emerald eyeliner in my waterline
now moving on to the rest of my face I
just wanted to show you guys that I do
have a shirt on I just always like to
keep it down that way I don't get makeup
all over it but I am going in with my
Kat Von D shade and light palette and
I'm just going to be bronzing up my face
a little bit I did already apply my
foundation concealer and powder what my
routine is exactly the same as this
video which I will link right here so I
promise next time will be a get ready
with me where I will show you my school
routine but as of right now nothing has
changed so with a smaller tapered brush
I'm just going to go over my nose
contour and then I'm going to go in with
some highlighter I'm using this gold
shade from my palette and I'm going to
be highlighting my nose my Cupid's bow
my boogers because I haven't done it in
a while and I'm going to actually apply
a little bit on my cheeks today
so I'm just taking a little bit on my
finger and I'm going to dab it on
and then I'm going to grab my bronzer
brush and just kind of blend it in that
way it's not too overpowering and I can
handle it you guys know I don't like too
much highlighter her lips today I'm
using Lolita liner by Kat Von D and for
lipstick today I'm using Aquarius 2 by
kathleenlights and color pop it's such a
pretty color so I'm just applying it and
then I'm just going to dab it in and
that way it just blends in nicely with
the lip liner for blush I'm using the
only blush that I ever use the BH nude
blush palette this beautiful light pink
shade and I like to get super close to
my nose it gives it a more natural look
not that we're going for a natural look
but it gives you more of like a natural
flushed look and then I'm picking up a
little bit of that gold highlighter from
my palette and I'm just going to be
highlighting my chest and my shoulders
and then to finish this look off I am
using the skins in a via makeup setting
spray and it's for oily skin and that is
how I got today's look
this is the final result I hope you guys
