today I am back with another video from
my color series today I'm going to be
doing the color orange and I have so
many orange favorites and I would have
to say I think for this summer my
favorite lip color is definitely orange
I'm going to go through a bunch of my
favorites and then after that I'm going
to show you how i got this makeup look
because i've seen so many of you guys
requesting it and it just so happened
that when I wore this makeup look I used
an orange color in my crease and then I
have the orange lip so I thought it'd be
a perfect time to do the color orange so
if you guys want to hear a few of my
favorite products please keep watching
first I'm going to start out with
lipsticks because I have a bunch of
orange lipsticks that I wanted to share
with you guys I'm gonna be doing I guess
maybe a couple peach colors along with
some brighter orange colors just to kind
of kill two birds with one stone the
color that I have on my lips and
definitely one of my favorites this
summer is dose of colors in the color
koi this is the perfect orange color and
it's so pigmented and so bright and I am
so pleasantly surprised with all of
their lipsticks they are definitely
worth every single penny
next up by coloured raine I have the
color candy girl this is like an orange
e pink color but I absolutely love this
color I love the finish of it I also
love how pigmented they are I do have a
new coupon code for coloured raine
lipsticks so if you guys are in the
market for really pigmented lipsticks I
back these up a hundred percent they are
so amazing another one of my favorites
is this bright orange color it's called
sweet nectar by Milani and I've used
this in a bunch of videos one thing that
I recommend for you guys is don't go out
and buy every single color lipstick it's
not necessary you can mix colors
together to get another color so if you
are looking for a light orange color and
you just only have a bright orange try
mixing the bright orange along with a
nude color and you will get a very
similar color to the more peachy light
orange colors so don't think I'm
recommending you guys to go out and buy
every single shade of lipstick I'm just
sharing with you guys some of my
favorites so if you are looking for one
particular color I'm going to swatch all
of them and then you could see maybe
which color is
be best for you the next hot orange
color that I have is by NYX and it's
called Hot Tamale and this is a nice
really deep bright red orange color also
by NYX I have the macaron lipstick and
orange blossom these macaron lipsticks
are awesome I have every single shade
and they are really pigmented as well
and they're super affordable which is
always great another awesome orange is
by Lime Crime this one is called Cosmo
pop and it's like a light orange shade
these are also very pigmented the lime
crimes and I love the cases for them
they're so cute
moving on to MAC lipsticks I have a few
that I absolutely love the first one is
called riot house by Kelly Osbourne the
matte collection this one is amazing and
I went to this Mac launch and when I got
there I was like third in line and it
was already sold out when I had got
there which was so upsetting because
this was the one that I wanted the most
later on that day I ended up in Garden
State Plaza Mall and I ran into one of
my subscribers actually ran into her
right by the Mac counter and I was like
oh my god did you get any of the new
collections like I waited online like a
loser and I didn't even get the freaking
color that I wanted so she was like well
I happen to have two of them because I
got one for my mom and I found out my
mom actually went and got one herself so
she just handed it to me was like I want
you to have this and I'm like no I
cannot take this seriously please let me
give you money for it and she was like I
do not want to take money for it we took
a picture I hope they're like 50 times
and then we were on our way but that was
literally the coolest thing that's ever
happened to me like you guys don't even
realize when I get to meet you guys just
meeting you alone is enough but the fact
that she wanted to give me one of these
limited edition lipsticks I was just so
excited and it was so unnecessary but so
awesome so I treasure this one so the
other MAC lipsticks that I have our
tangerine dream which is this one this
is a really pretty yellow orange I think
I use this one in my lipstick shades for
summer videos the next one is sushi kiss
this one is also like a pinkish orange I
love this one
and the third is called CB and 96 and I
recently just got this one and I had to
get it because it was said CB which
aren't my initials so obviously I had to
get it but it's a really pretty peachy
bronze color and I love this one as well
next up I have a few orange lip glosses
and one matte balm
the first lip gloss is bicolor your
smile I always mention these glasses but
they're so pigmented this one is in the
color salmon so it's a really really
pretty bright orange color the next one
is by dose of colors this color is
called sunshine kisses and this looks
really pretty over the koi gloss I mean
lipstick it's basically the same color
but in a lip gloss forum and the third
one is by Revlon these are the matte
bombs I've mentioned a few of these in
other videos these are perfect to bring
with you for on-the-go like really quick
nice little lip stain I will again show
you swatches of all of these I have
three lip liners that I wanted to share
so the first one is by NYX in the color
citrus then I have my makeup forever 24
C and the third one is by NYX and it's
called nectar next I have by L'Oreal
this magic skin beautifier in anti
fatigue I believe I use this in my beach
/ pool video what I wanted to let you
guys know about an orange tint is that
if you have greyish skin or the teeth
looking skin like just dull looking skin
the orange is gonna really brighten up
your face so I love this BB cream one
thing you have to remember with this is
you have to shake it really well because
otherwise it's gonna come out kind of
orange if you shake it it's more of your
skin tone color with an orange hue so
it's not pure orange so just make sure
to shake it really well when you're
using this that was the one thing that I
saw people asking why it was so Orange
but just make sure to shake it and then
you're all set so a new product that I
got is the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit I have the original one
which I absolutely love but now they're
coming out with a million different
shades and you can custom create your
own kit so for this I added an orange
powder and again it's gonna do the same
thing it's good for brightening up your
skin
moving on to I products by Sigma I have
this base called neutralized and it's a
really pretty orange base I have a few
of the shades from Sigma for the
eyeshadow bases but to be honest
sometimes I'll just use a concealer in
place of my eyeshadow base but if you
want the eyeshadow to look really
pigmented and you're trying to get a
really bright color I would suggest
using a base the same color as the
eyeshadow that you're planning on using
I've used this neutralized base and I
don't remember what your video was but I
know I used it recently and I really
love these bases also by Sigma I have
the color ginger pumpkin and as I
mentioned in my last color series I like
keeping these shadows in the casing
because they have these cute little dots
on them to tell the color and also show
a color so I have a nice job that's all
organized by the colors and I think that
was a really genius idea because
sometimes when you just buy too much
makeup it all kind of gets lost so to
have a nice way to organize it I think
is really important another orange
shadow that's just absolutely beautiful
is by Mac this is called pink bronze and
I've had this forever it's nowhere near
empty that's the one thing I love about
Mac not the one thing I love a million
things about it but the pet Mac pigments
they last forever and they're so amazing
when you use a pigment make sure to wet
your brush with either fix+ I drop
something to keep it wet that way you're
gonna get the richest color of the
pigment and this one is called pink
bronze when it comes out nice and orange
e the next two eyeshadow palettes that I
wanted to show you I actually used to
create this makeup look the first one is
the galaxy chic palette by BH and this
one has a really really pretty
mineralized orange color and this is the
one that I use in my crease I love how
pigmented this pound is and I could go
on and on about BH you guys know how
much I love it already so well leave it
at that and the second beach palette is
that take me to Brazil palette and it
has a few orange shades in it it's a
nice range of colors of the rainbow I
use this lime green color to line my
lower lash line along with the mint
color from actually the galaxy chic
palette as well
and for orange blushes I have a few like
peachy color blushes but I wanted to
share with you guys this one palette
that I mentioned all the time this
palette has a perfect orange blush right
here and then it has like a peachy
colored blush right here and I don't
know I have a million blushes but I
always tend to just grab this palette
they're really pigmented they do exactly
what I want it's not too much but it's
like the perfect amount for a foundation
primer I'm obsessed with the Smashbox
one it's a color correcting primer it's
like a salmon colored so again it's
gonna help write up your face help give
you an even complexion to start out your
makeup look I've been using this for
like two years now this is actually my
second one that I went through and it's
almost empty already which is crazy but
yeah this is definitely one of my
all-time favorite um base primers and
the last two products are some orange
polishes that are just incredible the
one that I'm wearing right now that
everyone has been asking about is called
flip flop flip flop flip flop fantasy
and it is incredible I even have it on
my toes and it's awesome this polish has
lasted over a week on my nails and I
didn't even use a top coat which is
really cool I just think it's such a
great neon orange color and I think a
million people have stopped me asking
what color it was so if you really want
to stand out this summer this is the
perfect color and the other one is a
very similar color this one's by Essie
and it's called tart deco and I think
this is probably from their newer summer
collection but it's like more of a light
pinkish orange but it's also really
beautiful so that is it as far as my top
orange products of course I have many
others but those are definitely the top
top favorites so if you guys want to
learn how to get this makeup look please
keep watching
to start off this look I'm going to be
priming my eyes with my pursuade
eyeshadow base by Sigma next I'm going
to be dipping my brush into my mac fix+
and then following that I'm using my
vanilla pigment I'm applying this all
over my eyelid in my tear duct and also
under my brow
with a larger blending brush I'm
grabbing this orange shadow and I'm
applying it right into the crease of my
eye
grabbing a smaller blending brush and
this brown shadow I'm then gonna be
applying this color right on the outer V
of my eye I'm also going to be blending
it in my crease and up towards the
orange color
to line my eyes I'm using my new gel
eyeliner by Sigma it's called wicked and
they also came out with this new
eyeliner brush and it's so incredible it
makes doing your eyeliner hundred times
easier
for false lashes I'm using da me up by
the lore
and then taking this NYX gold glitter
liner and I'm going to be lining right
above my black line
with my pencil brush and this mint color
I'm then lining my lower lash line right
over that I'm going to be grabbing this
lime green color and I'm going to be
applying it right above that mid line
for blush I'm picking up this orange
color and I'm going to be applying it
right on the apples of my cheeks
for a highlighter I'm using by Estee
Lauder and heatwave
next I'm lining my lips with this NYX
pencil and then over that I'm using my
dose of colors the color coy
this part is optional but next I'm just
lining my inner lashline with this black
pencil and then to top this look off I'm
just highlighting my Cupid's bow with
the same Mac vanilla pigment so this is
the final result I hope you guys enjoyed
