name is Carly and today I'm going to be
decluttering my shoe closet
so my shoe closet is a mess right now it

actually gone through and organized
everything and I figured I would tell
myself doing it because so if you guys

keep watching someone for my music on so
I'm gonna long that ahead of me
these lovers so comfy
one side is done sweating I have so many
shoes that I haven't worn in so long so
I have this big empty box
oh these bad boys were I believe the
first ever pair of boobs that I bought
myself this was in 2012 I think look at
these these have been worn I bought them
in a size bigger that I actually needed
because I just went to the mall like so
determined to buy them it was on my
birthday and they didn't have my size so
I ended up buying them in a size too big
and I used to wear like big fluffy socks
when I would wear these and I'd wear
them all the time do you guys see how
high this heel is like it's like the
size of my head literally it was just
way too much but I used to look so tall
these guys over here again he'll same
size as my entire head I wore these for
the first time to I met to New York City
and what's crazy about that weekend is
there was something really big and
terrible that happened in my family and
I missed the first day of IMS because of
it but the second day I did go crazy how
like shoes can bring back old memories
but I wore these too I met on that
Sunday and I threw myself together and I
went even though I was like the biggest
mess of all time but I swear like
meeting you guys it made my mind just
escape all the problems and
unfortunately didn't help my mind escape
from the pain that my feet were feeling
I had to be carried out of my mats not
even kidding like carried to my car
that's how bad my feet hurt you know
what no I wore these a few months prior
right
yeah to IMATS LA and I'm wear them both
days and I think I only 1 for like two
hours each day but I remember my feet
were killing me but yeah so those were
the only times I think I ever wore these
I just feel like I have to keep these
because I met so many of my subscribers
right in the beginning with these oh
right next to them these shoes off my
keep forever because they're so
beautiful look how cute these are these
are from BCBG I got them like 50% off
and I got them and didn't wear them for
the longest time
the only time that I wore these shoes
was beautycon London and oh what a
nightmare so I ended up having to walk
from my hotel to the venue because they
said it was only like a block away like
not a big deal so I walked it ended up
being I'm not even joking like seven or
eight blocks and it was hot out so I was
sweating and by the time I even got
there my feet were throbbing so I
already knew that was a bad sign because
usually if I'm like dropped off at the
event I can walk in and then within like
an hour of standing my feet hurt but
before I even got there my feet were
killing me so that was a lot of fun hi
chai
so the I think this is another crowd
never throw away because they look cute
sitting in my closet but that is as far
as they will ever go again
it's funny because I feel like all my
favourite shoes I'm going to like my big
events so these guys I wore to beauty
con with like this yellow jumpsuit and I
remember when I got these like clear
heels were not and whatsoever I wore
them and everyone was like what are you
wearing what are those shoes and then
like a year two years later as when Kim
Kardashian started wearing them and they
became like the biggest thing I'm not
saying that I started a trend but when I
walked these I hadn't seen them anywhere
and these were like the only ones there
by Jenny Ellen so shout out to her
because I think she was the one who
really brought these back funny story
about these shoes right here first of
all these are ridiculous Jeffrey
Campbell I used to buy like all those
crazy Jeffrey Campbell boots but these I
am going to donate I think they've
served their time and their purpose I
wore these a couple nights actually but
one night I remember wearing these when
I was going out to like a IDI
EDM concert is that what they're called
I don't know where it's like house music
so I was with my friend Sam and she's a
DJ so she's into all that type of music
and I remember I wore these and we
danced all night long we both woke up
the next morning and one of our big toes
was like purple and like fell off like
our toenails I know that's so nasty but
we both had the same issue and it was on
like opposite feet and I was wearing
these shoes that night so I can honestly
say that I danced my toenail off in
these shoes which is pretty
badass if you ask ping I think they've
reached their time but I will always
remember you and little member what you
did to my toe and my final shoe story
for the evening is these how pretty are
these by the way
surgeons epi is and not ease I got these
like two years ago I wear these when I
went to the Elton John Oscar party I
wore like that silver fringe outfit is
so amazing I actually wore these for
fashion week two three weeks ago when I
wore that same silver dress these shoes
hurt so bad both nights
the first night I lasted in them a lot
longer than I did the second night for
Fashion Week but these are ones that
I'll obviously never get rid of because
they're so beautiful they were expensive
and you would think expensive shoes
would it be more comfortable but these
were definitely not comfortable at so
ever but they're so beautiful and they
looked really nice with the dresses
well that's longer than I expected I
feel like I definitely got a workout in
I got rid of a lot of shoes a lot of
shoes that I really have not even
touched or warrant or needed I feel
freer I feel a little bit lighter I
think everything looks really beautiful
and now when I come in here I will be
excited and I won't get overwhelmed at
all of the clutter and all the mess so I
do have a lot left to do in my closet if
