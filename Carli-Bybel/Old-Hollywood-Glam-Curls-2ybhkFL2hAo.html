my way into
four Souls get lost miles get cross and
the pain won't go away
these I'm here
rust and here I was a kid
hi everyone thank you for watching I
missed you guys I was away this weekend
and I'm sorry I haven't posted a video
but I hope everyone had an amazing
weekend and I know a lot of you saw the
pictures that I had posted over the
weekend with my hair like this and I
don't know really what else to go up
besides like old Hollywood glamour like
I love how it like swoops in the front
and I never did anything like this
before this past week so when I learned
how to do it I was like okay well I love
how it looks and I know a lot of you do
too so I'm going to be showing you how I
got that look today I also wanted to say
thank you so much to everyone who had
helped donate for the sandy relief on my
website I did submit the money to the
American Red Cross but then this video
I'm just gonna post I had screen
recording of when I had uploaded just so
you guys can see me putting in the exact
amount on and then uploading it if
anyone had any questions so if you're
curious how I did my hair like this and
you want to learn how please keep
watching and I will show you how also
the one that I'm using in this video is
by new me and there's huge discounts so
I'm going to be posting codes below as
well to start this look off I'm just
going to be sectioning my hair I'm going
to be taking a small section and pulling
the rest up in a hair tie for this look
I'm using my nume wand
this was the three-in-one wand and it's
the middle size I believe it's a
one-inch and for this look I'm going to
be curling the curls a little bit
differently I'm going to be putting the
curling iron over my hair and wrapping
it up and around the iron this is going
to be the process that I'm going to be
using on both sides again putting the
iron on top of the hair and wrapping it
round upwards
once you feel the heat coming through
the hair you know the curl is finally
ready and you're just going to let it
out of the iron and I'm going to be
using my L'Oreal Elnett satin hairspray
taking another small section of hair I'm
going to be repeating the same steps I'm
going to be taking my iron and I'm going
to be putting it on top of the hair and
I'm going to be wrapping the curl
upwards
you
for the opposite side of my hair I'm
going to be repeating the same exact
steps the only thing that I'm going to
be doing different is I'm going to be
holding the iron in my opposite hand
placing it on top of the hair and again
wrapping it up
now that we finish the bottom layer I'm
going to be taking down my hair and just
adding a little bit more hair to the
bottom and then tying the rest back up
you
and now for the top of my hair this part
is going to be the only part that's
really the difference and it's going to
give you that old Hollywood glamour look
so I'm going to pull down the rest of my
hair and I'm going to do a deep side
part
you
I'm going to be splitting the section
into two and I'm going to do the smaller
piece first and this part is going to be
different than any of the other curls
that I have done what I'm going to be
doing is taking this hair I'm going to
be taking my iron and I'm going to be
pushing it up against my hair like this
and what this is going to do I'm going
to be curling my hair away from my face
this is going to give my hair a lot of
lift at the root and that's going to
give it that old Hollywood look
you
after I use the hairspray I'm just going
to pin these curls up just because since
they are shorter pieces they do tend to
fall quicker so I'm going to just pin
these up as I'm curling the rest of the
front of my hair then taking this
section I'm going to be also splitting
it into two pieces and I'm going to be
doing the front piece first doing that
same technique curling the hair away
from my face but what those does is by
pushing it up against your root it's
going to give it that lifted look
for the opposite side of my hair I'm
going to be doing that same thing again
curling my hair away from my face and
pushing it up against the root to give
it a lifted look as well just for the
short side section
next I'm going to be teasing those front
pieces and I'm just going to be teasing
them in the back and all teasing is is
really just back combing and I'm just
going to be doing it right along the
route of the two front pieces
you can go along the back part of your
hair and also tease it just to give it
more lift if that's what you're looking
for I'm just teasing all around the back
just so it's a little bit higher than
usual and again throughout the night
this will deflate a little bit so I do
recommend to using it
once I've finished styling it I'm going
to be applying my argan oil buying new
me just about a dime-size amount and I'm
going to be applying this all over the
bottoms of my hair and just kind of very
gently running my fingers through my
hair and this is just going to give it a
very silky shiny effect so that is how I
do my own version of old Hollywood
glamour hair I hope you all enjoyed I
absolutely love this look and I know
I'll be doing this a lot for the
wintertime so I hope you all learned a
lot and I will see you guys soon and
stay tuned for another video this week
love you all so much
here
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
