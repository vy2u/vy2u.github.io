today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this hairstyle right here this is
my take on the old Hollywood glam look I
did a video similar to this about three
years ago and a lot has obviously
changed and I learned some new tricks
found some easier ways to do it so I
wanted to just take you guys through
this look I feel like fall and winter
time screams this hairstyle I think it's
perfect for a holiday party or just a
night out it's really elegant and classy
and it's so easy to do so if you want to
learn how I got my hair exactly like
this please keep watching before
starting this look you want to make sure
your hair is air dried it could be a day
or two old just make sure you haven't
used two straightener on it whenever I
do my hair like this I always section
off my hair starting with the bottom I
run my finger through the back split it
into two sections and bring it forward
so it's a lot easier for this look I'm
using a one-inch curling wand and for
each side of my hair I'm going to be
curling the hair towards the face so you
just want to wrap it around and keep it
on for about 20 seconds until you feel
the heat coming through I like to touch
the hair to make sure it's not getting
too hot once you feel that heat coming
through that's how you know that it's
done some people and maybe a little bit
longer and some people may be a little
bit quicker so just test it out and see
which works best for your hairstyle
once you remove it from the heat you
just want to curl it back up in that
same position and then pin it up so it
has time to cool you want to repeat the
same step on the opposite side
for this type of look you want to make
sure you're using hairspray in between
each section I am using the Schwarzkopf
biotin volume and texture
h2o free hair spray this is actually my
second bottle I absolutely love this
hair spray it doesn't feel too sticky
which is always good so you're going to
continue to section off your hair using
the same steps that I had shown you for
the first layer you want to make sure
each side you are curling towards your
face and then pinning up
now when we get to the top layer this is
a little bit different from the previous
layers I am doing a very deep part feel
free to part it whichever way you prefer
for the back sections I'm going to be
curling away from my face and I'm going
to be curling it upwards so it's going
to give it some more body be careful you
don't burn yourself I have a problem
where I have burned myself way too many
time for the smaller side and the front
piece you want to make sure you're
curling it away from your face as well
for the back section you want to make
sure you're curling it up like this so
it's gonna again give it a little bit
more body and that other piece you can
kind of just clip it's not important
we're going to be brushing that out
moving on to the next side the same back
pieces you're going to do it the same
way curling away and pinning it up for
more body and the front piece is the
part that we want to do again a little
bit different we are curling this part
towards our face I section this into
about three sections that way I can do
smaller pieces and they all are getting
curled towards my face I'm also putting
them up the same way that there could be
encouraged and then later on I'm going
to go in and tease those pieces to give
it that really nice height
ittsan now that we've finished the whole
head you want to spray it one last time
and you want to keep these curls pinned
up like this for at least 20 minutes
that way it has time to cool and it's
really going to help keep the hairstyle
in all day
okay so once you removed all the curls
you are done and this is it
just kidding can you imagine you need to
slowly brush out these curls so they're
not so PC so the first thing I'm doing
is smoothing down the right side of my
hair and putting it behind my ears for
this look I like to keep that one side
behind my ears and then give the top a
lot of body once I brushed it through a
little bit I'm grabbing the top piece
and I'm going to start teasing and
slowly slowly do it so it stays up once
you let go of it I'm going to repeat
that same step with the three sections
that I used for the top the middle piece
you can tease both the front and the
back to give it a little extra body and
the third piece you can do the same
thing so tease underneath
tease a little bit on top and then you
will see your hair will stand straight
up
once you finish that you want to spray
it so it stays and then you want to go
back to your smoothing brush and start
smoothing it all down so you very
lightly want to smooth it because we
want to keep that T's in there that's
going to help keep that height in all
day so you just very lightly smooth it
to get rid of any of that frizziness and
you just kind of have to play around
with it until it's shaped the way you
want once you finally get it as high as
you want I'm just going back with the
curling iron and just curling that whole
piece away from my face and you can see
it just gives it a really pretty spoopy
look
okay so now that it is sprayed and
shaped how I want it I'm going in with
the serum this one is by Schwarzkopf and
it's the satin frizz control and protect
nectar Beauty oil I love this stuff it
smells so good I'm applying a little bit
onto the ends just to smooth out the
look a little bit then I'm going in with
the Schwarzkopf diamond color and
radiant shine boost tonic this stuff is
amazing it will instantly give your hair
the most perfect shine it doesn't leave
it feeling greasy whatsoever and it
doesn't weigh your hair down so if you
want that really really shiny look this
product is amazing
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and hopefully
picked up some new tricks to try it out
for yourselves I love you guys so much
and until next time I will see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
