today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this bright fun makeup look for
spring I figured since last week I only
got up one video for you guys this week
I would make it up and do three so I
hope you guys enjoy this video and if
you want to learn how i got this makeup
look please keep watching to start off
this look i'm going to be priming my
eyes with my concealer just so the
eyeshadow stays on a lot better for this
look I'm using my BH Galaxy chic palette
I'm first dipping my brush into a fix+
and then I am applying this color all
over my eyelids next with a large
blending brush I'm picking up the color
Venus and I'm applying that right into
the crease of my eye
picking up this cup or shadow I'm
applying that underneath my lower
lashline to really bring out the orange
shadows I love mixing oranges with
coppers I think it looks really great
together next I'm just grabbing
something with a flat surface to really
extend my bottom lash line I'm not going
to be doing an eyeliner for this look so
I wanted to at least bring this out to
really elongate my eyes with a smaller
blending brush I'm picking up the color
Aphrodite and I'm applying that on the
outer V of my eye this is a beautiful
dark cranberry color and this is just
gonna really pull them look together and
it's going to give you also some depth
in your crease so it's just not all
orange and it's not just one color
you
to highlight under my brows I'm using
mary-lou manizer and I'm also applying
the shade right in my tear duct
to line my inner lashline I'm using this
black eye pencil from Jordana and then
I'm just extending the inner part of my
eye I love doing this and I feel naked
without it so that's the only reason I'm
doing it I'm using the Kat Von D tattoo
liner to do this for bronzer I'm using
this one by BH I'm just swirling my
brush and using all four colors and it
gives me a beautiful shimmery bronze
look so I'm just applying this all over
my face I already contoured and
highlighted my face before the video
started so I'm just bronzing up my face
a bit
moving on to lips i'm using the color
fruit cocktail by mac and i'm just
lining my lips with that I feel like I
can't do my lips without a liner so I
know some people don't need the liner so
if you don't need the liner skip the
step and for lipstick I'm using by
Milani the color sweet nectar and since
I wanted to use a lot of affordable
products in this video I just wanted to
show you guys that you can just add a
translucent powder to any creamy
lipstick and it'll give it a matte
finish after I finish my lipstick I
realized that with this top it was a
little too much orange so I decided to
change for the intro and the outro but I
just topped this look off with a little
bit of the mary lou manizer and that is
it so this is the final result I wanted
to show you guys how to make your own
matte lipstick at home because the new
craze has been the matte lipsticks and I
don't want you guys to think you have to
go out and buy every single color you
can just use your lipsticks at home and
a little translucent powder and then you
have a matte lipstick so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and until next time
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
