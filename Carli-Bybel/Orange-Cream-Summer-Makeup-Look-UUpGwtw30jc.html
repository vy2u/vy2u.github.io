out where your place is
but in their narrow minds there's no
room for anyone dares to do something
different
oh hi everyone thank you for watching so
I'm finally back here in my room filming
a video for you guys I feel like it's
been forever I finally unpacked all of
my stuff I cleaned up my room and now I
feel back at home so I'm sorry it's been
a little bit since I've done a makeup or
beauty type video but I wanted to get up
for you guys a nice fresh spring look
and when I was trying to decide what I
wanted to do for this video I was
looking up some popular spring trends
that are going on right now and the
color orange is huge this year and I was
actually really excited about that I saw
it all over the runway so I figured why
not do a look that incorporates some
bright orange lips when I think of
spring makeup I think of neutral eyes
and then the bold colors on your lips
like the corals the Pink's the oranges
and all of that good stuff so in
celebration of spring ludora boutique is
offering 40% off site-wide for all of my
viewers and I'm actually wearing her
earrings right now I just got a couple
new pairs and they are absolutely
amazing for all of you guys always
wondering where I get off my handmade
bling earrings ludora boutique is my
absolute favorite website and she has
never offered this kind of discount
before usually we get a 10% code which
is so pretty good but 40% off site-wide
so if any of you guys have been holding
out on buying now is the time to do it
I'm not sure how long it's going to last
for I will list all of the info down in
the description bar but I just wanted to
let you guys know because it is super
exciting and I just got a few new pairs
so I really quickly just wanted to let
you guys know that so if anyone is
interested in checking out her earrings
I will list the code and the website
below but if you guys want to learn how
to get this spring makeup look please
keep watching
to prime my eyes I'm using the pursuade
eyeshadow base by Sigma and I'm applying
this all over my eyelids this is going
to help keep my eyeshadow on all day and
since I am using a white shadow it's
always good to put a nice base
underneath it for this look I'm using
eyeshadow from the forever nude palette
first I'm picking up this white
eyeshadow and I'm applying this all over
my eyelids I'm also applying this color
underneath my brows and in my tear duct
next up I'm grabbing these two shimmery
brown colors and I'm applying it with a
big blending brush right into my crease
a little bit goes a long way since we
want to keep this look really natural
I'm just going to be dipping it in once
and then sharing the shadow for both
eyes and what I love is this brush does
most of the work for you so just keep
doing your windshield wiper motions and
you should get a really nice blended
look the one who's been where you are
wishing all the buzz what sticks and
stones those words cut deep but they
don't mean you
and you're now
I'm then grabbing this darker brown
color and I'm applying it with this
smaller shader brush right in the outer
V of my eye
then mixing those two brown shadows
again I'm going to be lining my lower
lashline and I'm gonna be slowly
blending it into the white color
next I'm applying false lashes I like to
cut a couple of them off that way I can
apply them on the outer part of my eyes
and I think it makes your eyes look
bigger and just overall better so that
is why I do cut them but I will be just
gluing them on my eyes and sticking them
on and playing around them till I get
them in the perfect spot
I'll be lining my inner lashline with
this gold l'oreal h IP liner and it's
really pigmented so i really love this
look and i'm going to be applying that
same white color that i used on my eyes
right on the Cupid's bow of my lid next
i'm picking up this orange blush and i'm
applying it all over my cheeks and then
i'm just blending it all in with my
foundation brush also by sigma to line
my lips I'm using lasting sensation by
Mac and this is the closest lip liner I
had to the color orange so I'm just
going to be using that and then using my
finger to blend it in then I'm grabbing
Cosmo pop and I am applying that all
over my lips this is a perfect light
orange color and I actually wore this a
couple times on vacation as well I think
it's a perfect color for spring or
summer but for those of you who are on a
little bit of a budget don't worry at
the end of the video I will show you
some cheaper options and then over that
I'm adding a little bit of the Milani
sweet nectar right into the outer
corners of my lips to give it a little
bit of a darker orange look and over
that I'm using my favorite nude gloss
and that's just gonna give it a nice
shiny look to highlight my face I'm
using this new HD illuminating bomb by
Stila cosmetics and I just picked this
one up from Sephora and I'm just gonna
be very lightly tapping it on to my
cheeks to give it a really nice glow so
this is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this video
I really quickly just wanted to talk
about a few orange lipsticks that I did
have for those of you on a budget or for
those of you who don't want to go out
and spend a little bit extra on a
lipstick cuz you're not sure if you'll
like the orange so I have a couple
different ones the first one that I
wanted to show you was by Revlon and I'm
gonna show you some swatches of these so
this one is like one of the color sticks
oh it's called colorburst matte balm and
these are pretty cool these you can get
right at the drugstore and it's a nice
matte orange color so if you guys want
to go out and try this orange trend but
again you're not sure definitely check
out the drugstore because they do have
great options as well another bright or
that I have and I love is this one is
called candy girl and it's by coloured
raine cosmetics and this one has a
little bit more of a pink hue to it and
the third option is by Milani cosmetics
and this one is called sweet nectar and
normally when I would do like a peach
colored lip what I would do is I would
mix usually the sweet nectar is the one
that I've been using and I would mix it
with a nude lipstick and it gives you a
perfect peach lip for those of you
wondering how I usually do it but as you
can see these are three different
affordable shades of orange and I mean
try them out see which one works best
for you but I wanted to give you guys
some other options but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video stay tuned because I
promise I am back to filming and I'm
gonna get as many videos up for you guys
as possible as always leave any comments
or suggestions for future videos in the
comment box below so I love you guys so
much I hope you enjoyed this video and
until next time
so much more
sunny
back on all these days and all this pain
is gonna be
