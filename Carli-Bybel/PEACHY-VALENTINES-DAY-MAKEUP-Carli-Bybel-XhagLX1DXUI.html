today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here i
wanted to create a couple looks this
year for valentine's day so this is
going to be my first look it's super
fresh and very natural-looking for those
of you guys that don't want to do
anything crazy
anyone who wants a more dramatic smoky
eye don't worry i will be filming that
one next but I wanted to do something
really fresh in my last video a lot of
you guys were asking how I had done my
makeup so I figured I would switch it up
and kind of add some more peach shades
instead of the pink shades and that is
how I got this look right here so I
switched up my foundation routine a
little bit so I figured I would do a
full face look for you guys today so if
you want to see how I got this
valentine's day inspired look please
keep watching so start off this look I'm
priming my face with my Too Faced
hangover primer I'm then using this NYX
liquid illuminator and I'm just tapping
it onto my skin you can either do it
this way or you can blend it in with
your foundation as well before this
tutorial I applied a body bronzer all
over my body to give it like a shiny
look that's why my face looks a lot
lighter so I'm gonna use a little bit of
a darker foundation today I'm using this
one by la girl it's the pro coverage
foundation that I had mentioned in my
favourites video I am applying it today
with my fingers I know this is crazy
this is the first time I've ever filmed
myself on camera doing something like
this so I tried this out a couple days
ago when I was watching fisa on snapchat
she had done my makeup when I was in
London and I loved how it came out so
she had shown her current makeup routine
and she used her fingers so I was like
okay I have to try it out and I was
amazed at how it came out it looked so
much more natural in person especially
so I tried it out and I did it like
three or four times already and I loved
how it looked next I'm using cream
contour I'm using this one also by le
girl it's in
we color beautiful bronze and I am
contouring my cheekbones my forehead my
nose and my jawline I'm also applying a
little bit right underneath my lip and
then I'm blending all that in so I'm
sure some of you guys are wondering why
the cream contour you can 100% skip this
step if you guys want the reason that I
really like to do it is because then the
powder has something to cling to you
have to use a lot less powder and it
ends up being over on the same amount of
makeup anyway so it's really all about
preference whenever I'm going out and I
know I want to last a long time I always
like to do the cream contour and then
the powder on top and that's just the
way I prefer to do it so again it's all
about preference for concealer I'm using
this new one by NARS and I'm applying
that under my eyes with my fingers as
well so I noticed that when I applied it
with my fingers I didn't use as much
product but it covered a lot more and
then just very lightly with my Beauty
Blender I just made sure that it was
blended perfectly and I removed any
excess product
next I'm going in with my artists brush
and I'm blending out my nose contour I
like to do it in like small circular
motions I know it looks really harsh now
but after I Pat everything with the bead
butter it's all gonna blend in really
nicely anyway
so again just small circular motions and
then take your Beauty Blender and just
blend in all the sharp lines just to
make sure everything's blended nicely
and then I'm going in with my cameo
powder and I'm setting underneath my
eyes I'm also dragging this down the
sides right next to my contour on my
nose and then whatever is left on the
Beauty Blender I'm just applying on my
smile lines on my chin in between my
brows and on my forehead just to kind of
set my face I'm then going in with my
brow is by Anastasia Beverly Hills it's
in the color ebony and I'm filling in my
brows once I fill them in I'm using the
brow powder also in Ebony and I'm just
darkening them up a bit and then I'm
just removing the powder from underneath
my eyes and I'm just kind of doing like
circular motions just to make sure
everything on my face is set then I'm
going in with my NARS Laguna bronzer and
I'm applying that on my cheeks on my
forehead under my chin and also on my
neck I haven't used this bronzer in so
long but I am a big fan of it I'm also
using a smaller tapered brush and I'm
applying that on the sides of my nose
just to set the nose contour as well
next I'm going to apply a little bit of
a cream blush as well this one is by
Josie Maran and I'm just tapping that
into my cheeks this part again is
optional I will be applying a little
tiny bit of a powder blush on top but
this is another technique that I tried
out from five Zoe's video and I just
really loved how it looked for eyes
today I'm using the new Kylie peach
palette I just got it in the mail
yesterday so I was like why not I'm
using this peach color and I'm applying
that with a large fluffy brush right
into my crease for today's look I knew I
wanted to keep it really simple and
neutral on the eyes so I'm just gonna be
using a few shades next up I'm picking
up this matte brown color and I'm also
applying that into my crease with this
large brush I'm just blending the brown
and peach together to kind of like
neutralize it so it's not so so so
orange then I'm picking up this dark
orange color with a smaller blending
brush and I'm applying that on the outer
V of my eye for eyeliner today I'm
trying out this new one by Tarte it's
more of like the marker pen I do like
these type of eyeliners because they are
super black in the beginning but they
always tend to dry out so I will keep
you guys posted on how this one lasts
for me for lashes I'm using the w SP
lashes by Christina and my lash glue
dried out the one without the cap so I
had to use this one today but it wasn't
as bad as I had remembered so I'm then
going back in with those same colors
that I used in my crease and I'm
applying them on my lower lash line I am
using the lighter peach the darker
orange and then I'm also grabbing the
shimmer brown color and that is what
makes up the bottom crease then from
mascara I'm using this one by buxom and
then for my lower lash line I wanted to
use like a bronze eye pencil so I'm
using this one by color pop it ended up
breaking on me the one thing that has
happened a few times with the color pop
liners as they fall apart but they are
so affordable so I mean it's bound to
happen for lips I'm using BFF 2 so if
you guys remember my last video I used
BFF and I use that one till there's
literally nothing left so the BFF 2 is
more of like a nude color as opposed to
the
that pinky nude and for lips I'm using
peachy-keen by Gerard cosmetics I'm just
using a little bit and it's going to
give you like the perfect peachy lip and
then for highlighter I'm using a cream
highlighter as well since I use the
couple cream products in this video this
one's by Natasha de Nonna and then I'm
taking this Wet n Wild powder highlight
and I'm highlighting the tip of my nose
underneath my nose in my tear ducts and
also underneath my brow
and then to finish off this look I'm
applying a little bit of this peach and
pink blush together just to brighten up
the look
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video again I will be
filming a couple looks this year for
Valentine's Day so let me know if
there's anything specific you want to
see but I'm thinking of doing like a
nice smoky eye next and then maybe
something with red lips and if you guys
have any other ideas definitely send
them my way but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and until next time I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
