today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here i
think this is one of my favorite makeup
looks to date that I've ever done I
wanted to do something colorful today
and I wasn't sure really what colors I
wanted to use so let me have some of the
new products that I had recently brought
up into my new room that I have yet to
put away so since it is now spring
although tonight it's like one of the
windiest news ever and it's freezing
outside but in my house it feels like
spring sends the heat all the way up so
I wanted to do something that screams
spring oranges and Pink's are so big
this year so I wanted to do what was on
trend and I am upset with how it came
out I also very quickly want to let you
guys know that I will be revealing my
palette this week I got the okay that I
am finally allowed to show you guys so I
can't wait so stay tuned because I'm
going to be filming that video for you
guys as well so thing I want to see how
I got this book right here then please
keep watching so whenever I do dramatic
looks like honestly just use concealer
for a base and then going in with the
color soft core which is a new matte
shadow from colour-pop and I'm blending
this color in with my Sigma e-40 brush
I'm then picking up the color secrets
which is a lighter pink and I'm just
applying that right over it just to give
it a more blended look I'm going back in
with those same two colors and I'm just
starting it up a little bit more then
picking up the color slim - I am going
in with my Sigma e25 blending brush and
I'm applying that right on the outer V
of my eye I really wanted to go for like
a peachy pink look for today
so you can just kind of blend in the
peach with the pink and it'll give you a
really pretty base then I'm picking up
the color red ochre from the Anastasia
Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance palette
and I'm applying that on the outer V of
my eye so as always I like to apply the
colors and then I'll go back in a little
bit later and I'll darken them up but
first I'm doing all the matte shades and
then I'm going to go in with some more
shimmery shades afterwards so I am
lightly blending that up into the crease
and then I'm going back in with a clean
blending brush and I am just blending
everything all together so I'm mixed two
of the new shades from my palette from
my lips today so I'm applying that on my
lid first and then I'm picking up a
little bit of this textured shadow which
is called rose gold from the hooter
palette and I'm applying that over it to
give it a little bit more of a sparkle
I'm going in with a smaller pencil brush
and the color red ochre and I'm using
something with a straight line just to
make sure I keep the dark shadows right
where I want them I just want the outer
V of my eye and the lower bottom part of
my eye as well to be the darkest part
then I'm just picking off the nude shade
from my palette and I'm just applying
that underneath my brows for the inner
part of my lower lash line I'm using the
color centerfold and I'm just blending
that into the red ochre color and this
is more of like a peachy shade so I
really love how it all ended up tying
together for liner I am using my Tarte
East liner to be honest the textured
shadow was a little bit hard to do
eyeliner over
I feel like next time I could just even
skip out without it because I would have
gotten the exact same look as far as
color on the lid and it just added a
little bit more texture and sparkle to
it or the inner highlight I'm using the
colored kitty cat from the Nicole
Guerrero and Anastasia Beverly Hills
glow Kint it is such a pretty light pink
shade for lashes I'm using the Samantha
lashes by huda beauty and they're kind
of natural but yet they're dramatic at
the same time so I thought they were
perfect for this look so again I just
like to add a little bit more shadow
over everything towards the end that way
everything is all blended and looking
good I'm finishing off this look with a
little nude eyeliner and then some
bottom mascara bronze up my face i'm
using the color milk chocolate bronzer
by Too Faced obviously before I did this
video I did my face makeup but if you
guys want to see my exact face routine
I'll link my most recent get ready with
me video and hasn't changed in quite a
while so again that will be my exact
face routine and then to highlight my
nose I'm using that same color the kitty
cat color from Nicole's palette so I'm
just doing my nose as I always do I do
like an exclamation point and then I'm
going to highlight right on my Cupid's
bow as well I put a tiny tiny tiny bit
underneath my notes today but listen I'm
weaning off of it okay
but for blush I just wanted to try out a
new palette today so I got the next one
not too long ago and honestly it was
like way too sparkly and not pigmented
so I just went right back to my ELF
palette in the color light and this one
I've used before and I really really
liked it so I'm mixing the top left and
the bottom right shade and I'm just
patting it onto my cheeks one of the
blushes is matte and the other one has a
little bit of a shimmer
so them mixed together is like the
perfect mix in my opinion especially
because I don't like to use highlighters
so it's going to give me a little bit of
a glow for lips today I'm using the
colour-pop pencil in the color birdie
and it was a little too pink but the
pink was like the perfect color pink so
I'm also going in with the color Chi and
it's a little bit more of a brown
undertone so I am using the brown on the
edges and then I'm going to actually
fill in my lips with the birdie lip
liner just because I really love how it
looks and then I'm applying a tiny bit
of the color love muffin and it's a
satin lip I just wanted to add a little
bit of moisture to my lips they're
really dry lately so I figured this
would help it a bit so I'm going back in
with my highlighter I'm going to
highlight my collarbone on my shoulders
and also on my chest a little bit
whenever I am doing a whole face makeup
like this I always always make sure my
chest is the same color and if I'm
wearing something low like this I like
to add a little bit of highlight as well
and then to set this entire look I am
using the Kat Von D setting spray this
is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this video
to me this makeup looks cream springtime
so I will definitely be recreating this
next time that Bret kicks me out because
I'm literally obsessed make sure to stay
tuned because the end of the week I will
be posting my palette reveal as well so
I can't wait to show you guys I hope
you're as excited as me I love you guys
so much thank you for watching and I'll
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
