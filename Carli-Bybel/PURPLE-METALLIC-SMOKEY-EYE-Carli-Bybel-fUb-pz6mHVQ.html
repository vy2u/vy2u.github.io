those of you guys that are new on my
channel my name is Carly and today I'm
gonna be showing you guys how to get
this makeup look right here it
originally started off as like a matte
look and then I added a little bit of a
metallic and then I found this shirt so
it's like a metallic purple smokey eye I
hope everyone had an amazing New Year's
Eve and I hope your new year is off to a
great start
I'm sorry that it's the 12th and it's my
first video up but my bestfriend mousse
sister passed away so it's been a really
sad and hard couple of days so I have
been with her the past week and I
finally have some free time to sit down
and film for you guys today so if you
want to see how I got this makeup look
right here then please keep watching to
start off today's look I'm gonna be
picking up this mouth shade with my
Sigma e-40 brush and I'm gonna blend
that right into my crease starting like
right against the bone here and then I'm
just gonna drag it up towards the brow
with my Sigma F 70 brush I'm picking up
Nina's orchid which is from the Natasha
de Nonna palette and I'm going to be
applying that all over the outer part of
my eyelid
with my morphe m4 3/3 brush I'm picking
up that same purple shade and I'm going
to start blending that into my crease we
want to keep this shade right below the
mauve shade that we just used
was my Sigma e30 brush I'm picking up
the shade aubergine right here and we're
going to be applying that in the outer V
as well as right directly in the crease
I'm going to use a little setting spray
to enhance the color a bit
going back to my pallet I'm picking up
this nude matte shade and I'm gonna be
applying that right in the inner third
going back to my morphe m43 3 i'm
picking up that same dark plum color and
I'm gonna start blending right above it
very lightly to make sure there's no
sharp lines grabbing more of that plum
color with my pencil brush again I'm
just dragging that down into the outer V
so it blends more seamlessly
I'm grabbing that brighter purple orchid
and remember you put out a little bit
and just blend them both together
grabbing a little bit of love letter
from the modern renaissance I'm going to
be blending that on my lid as well in
the middle and also a little bit in the
crease
with a cleaning 40 I'm just gonna very
lightly blend all that as well
grabbing the color left letter with my
Easter D I'm going to be applying that
on my lower lash line
and I'm also picking up that orchid
shade the purple and we're gonna put it
on the outer half grabbing this pink
shimmery color from my palette I'm going
to be applying that right on top of my
lower lash line and also right in the
center grabbing a little bit of this
k'kaw beauty powder I'm gonna apply a
tiny bit right on top of that shimmer
just to give it a little bit more of a
pop for liner I'm using Physicians
Formula
for mascara I'm using the buxom and I
have eyelash extensions on right now
that's why I'm not gonna be using lashes
today you can use fake lash strips when
you have extensions I've done it before
but I just got them done so they're
still nice and full to bronze up my face
I'm grabbing my shade and light palette
and I'm going to be using this color
right here
the highlight my nose I want to be using
this pink shade from my palette and my
Cupid's bow
and I'm gonna grab this gold and this
brown and just it a little bit to my
cheeks
for lip liner I'm using Lolita by Kat
Von D and for lipstick I'm using
Veronica liquid lipstick by Anastasia
Beverly Hills I'm gonna grab a little
bit of this pink shade and just dab it
onto my lips feel like a modality finish
before blush I'm gonna grab a little bit
of this shade and the shade
I hate wearing my hair up without
earrings it's like a pet peeve and I
can't do it
so this is the final result I hope you
