hello everybody thank you for watching I
apologize in advance for this headband I
just I'm having such a bad hair day
today and I just didn't know what to do
with my hair and this is what I was
using when I was applying my makeup and
I didn't want to do my hair so this is
what I'm gonna be working with today I
am doing a prom makeup look for you guys
I wanted to do something really fresh
and glowy and a little bit of sparkle
when I used to freelance and I would do
proms this was definitely my busiest
season and I would always get pretty
similar requests as far as makeup looks
of course I will be doing at least one
more problem look for you guys because I
know this look won't go with every look
but I figure this peachy pink look would
go great if you're wearing gold if
you're wearing white if you're wearing
silver if you're wearing orange if
you're wearing peach coral really any of
those colors so I think this look is
really glowy and fun and I use a lot of
drugstore products along with some
higher-end products so if any of you
guys want to recreate it you can go out
and do it yourself
when I had my junior and senior prom I
did my own makeup I didn't go out
anywhere and get it done and not only
did I do my own makeup but I did about
three of my friends makeup as well so
don't feel like you guys need to go out
and get a makeup appointment because I
mean yeah for some of you guys maybe
makeups not your thing and you want to
go get it done so all the power to you
go get your glam on and relax on that
day but for my girls that want to do it
yourself do it yourself save some money
and that way you know at least you'll be
happy with your makeup you're not gonna
leave hating it and you're not gonna
have to go home and fix it so if you
guys want to learn how I got this prom
makeup look right here please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
priming my eyes with benefits they don't
stray for this look I'm using the new
L'Oreal eyelet nude number two and I'm
picking up this grayish brown color and
I'm applying that right in my crease
with a blending brush
next up I'm picking this darker brown
color with a smaller blending brush and
I'm applying that right on the outer V
of my eye then I'm picking up this
eyeshadow from makeup geek and I'm
applying that all over my lids the
camera kind of washes it out a little
bit it looks a little bit more peachy in
person but I absolutely love the shadow
and then over that I'm applying makeup
forever sparkles to give it a really
pretty sparkly look for eyeliner I'm
using me clay eyeliner by Tarte and for
lashes I'm using the Carly lash Bible or
lashes
for primer I'm using by Smashbox the
pore minimizing primer this one is
definitely my favorite and for
foundation I'm mixing NC 20 and NW 15
Studio Fix fluid by Mac and I'm applying
that with just a regular brush and then
I'm blending all the foundation in with
my Beauty Blender
for concealer I'm using by Tarte the
creaseless concealer in the color light
and I'm just applying that right
underneath my eyes I'm also going to mix
in my highlighter which is Mac prep and
prime and light boost just to give it a
little bit of a brighter look I want the
utter eyes to be really bright and to
bring them forward so that is why I'm
doing that it may look like a lot of
product but it is very thin so once
you've blended it with a Beauty Blender
it's gonna feel a really light weight on
your face believe it or not so next I'm
going in with a contour shade this one
is by Mac it's called walnut coffee and
I'm just gonna be contouring my nose
with this
to set the concealer I'm using my laura
mercier at loose powder and translucent
and I'm just applying next to mount
right underneath my eyes for bronzer I'm
using this one by Mac it's called gimme
Sun and is so shimmery and so beautiful
and it's great for anyone with lighter
skin tone as a bronzer if you guys have
darker skin tone it might not be a
bronzer on you but it's gonna give you a
beautiful glow I've been loving this
lately and I'm going in with my contour
shade this one's by Anastasia and I'm
just applying that right into the
hollows of my cheeks around my forehead
under my jawline and a little bit on my
neck
going back to that same shadow I'm
applying a little bit right underneath
the center part of my lower lash line
again it's looking pretty light on
camera but in person it definitely looks
a lot better then grabbing these two
shades with a pencil brush I'm applying
that right on the outer third and the
inner third
and then I'm going back in with the
sparkles to give it a little extra
sparkle underneath and also on top of my
eyelid
I'm next lining my inner lashline with
my NYX white pencil to set the cream
contour on my nose i'm using the same
shade that i use to contour with a
smaller pointy brush
to highlight I'm using these to buy
Revlon they are the photo already skin
lights in peach and pink and I'm just
going to mix them together and tap them
right on to the top of my cheekbone
if you guys want a little extra
highlight this top shade is actually
perfect for a highlighter so I'm just
applying a little bit right over the
cream highlight that I just did
you
so this is the final result I think this
is perfect for prom day I hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know what
other colors you want me to incorporate
for prom looks because I definitely will
do at least one or two more for you guys
I think this is definitely something
that one of my clients would have asked
me for back in the day so I hope you
guys enjoyed and as usual I am wearing
my Carlie lash by velour lashes I
absolutely love them and I think for
prom if you guys are a little on the
fence about them go for it for prom you
need false lashes for prom because it's
gonna really help make your eyes stand
out and just give you that little extra
umph that maybe you don't have every
other day throughout the year so if you
guys want to purchase the Carlie lash I
have a 15% off code I'll list every
detail in the description box below as
usual as well as on my blog so I hope
you guys enjoyed I love you so much and
until next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
