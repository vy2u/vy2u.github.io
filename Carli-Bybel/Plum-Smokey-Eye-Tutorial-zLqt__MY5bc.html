in this tutorial I'll be showing you how
I got this plum smoky eye makeup look
the first thing that I'm going to be
using is a concealer stick and also a
foundation brush just to be applying
this on my eyelid so my eyeshadow stays
on all day
the first color that I'm going to be
using is this gold color from this
Maybelline eye studio palette it's
called sapphire stylist that's the name
of the palette this is gonna be going
right on the bottom half of my eye it's
gonna be going like right where you
would apply your eyeliner
taking my Celia makeup palette I'm going
to be taking this pale yellow color and
applying this right over the gold just
to lighten up the gold color and give it
more of a shine
next I'm going to be taking this pearly
white color from my Mac palette and this
is gonna be going underneath my brow
bone
using a smaller eyeshadow brush I'm
going to be taking this plum color from
my Mac palette it is a limited edition
palette it's called the evil eye
eyeshadow palette and the color that I'm
going to be using is called Pallas
pedigreed I'm going to be applying this
color right into my crease I'll be
blending this in later on once I apply
the rest of my colors
I'm next going to be taking the shimmery
plum color and applying that right above
where I had placed the gold and right
below my crease you're gonna blend this
color upward as well as downward so it
all blends in nicely on your eyelid
taking my mac blending brush and the
same plum color I'm going to then be
blending in the shadow in my crease
taking carbon by Mac which is a black
color I'm gonna be then applying this in
the outer V of my eye which is gonna
make my eye have more depth
using a Mac liquid last eyeliner I'm
then gonna be lining my upper eyelid
you
I'm then applying my mascara which I'm
using L'Oreal telescopic mascara I love
this mascara because the wand is
different than the other brushes it does
make my eyelashes super long then taking
a small angled brush and that same plum
color from my Mac palette I'm gonna be
applying that on my lower lash line
going back to the shimmer plum color
that is going to be going in the inner
part of my lower lash line I'm then
taking that pale yellow color from my
Celia palette and applying that right in
the tear duct of my eye using a black
eye pencil I'm then going to be lining
my inner lash line this is gonna make my
eyes appear more narrow
the lipstick I'm using this tutorial is
by Maybelline it's number four for five
and it is called on the mouth I'm not
really sure if that's how you pronounce
it
thank you so much for watching I hope
you enjoyed this tutorial have a great
day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
