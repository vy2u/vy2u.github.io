you were gonna take my hand
whisper the sweetest words hi everybody
thank you for watching so finally
October is here and I'm going to be
doing all kinds of Halloween makeup
looks the first one that I decided to do
was a Pocahontas slash Indian inspired
makeup look if you can already tell once
I finish this makeup look I realized
that it's not anything too crazy drastic
that if you do want to use this look for
maybe a night out or something like that
you can do that as well so please keep
watching and I will show you how I just
want to apologize ahead of time I am a
little bit sick and my allergies are
getting to me so I sound a little bit
nasally but I'm applying this tattoo
with just a red eyeliner and it was easy
for me to do because I was looking at a
picture of Pocahontas actual tattoo so
if you pull up a picture it's a lot
easier to copy it first you're going to
take an eyeshadow base or any concealer
and apply it all over your eyelid and
also underneath your eyebrow
I'm going to be using my Too Faced sexy
palette from Stephanie I'm taking this
light beige color and my Mac 242 brush
and I'm going to be applying this right
on my eyelid and also underneath my
eyebrows feel free to use any other
colors that are basically the same I
know the elf palette has a lot of
similar colors and that's only ten
dollars next I'm picking up this light
brown color and my Mac 224 blending
brush and I'm just gonna be applying
this right into the crease of my eye
I wanted to add a little bit of a
reddish-brown in it as well I believe
this one is called brick by Mac and I'm
going to be applying this with the same
brush right over that light brown color
for eyeliner I always go to a gel liner
this one is by Mac they also have one by
Maybelline which is just as good and I'm
using my Mac 210 eyeliner brush and I'm
just going to be lining my upper lash
line
once you finish the top you're just
going to extend where the tail is down
to your lower lash line and you're gonna
go about half way then picking up this
darker brown color at my Mac 219 pencil
brush I'm going to be applying this
right into that crease of my eye I leave
my eyes open so I can see exactly where
my crease is and this is just gonna make
our eyes have more depth or make it
appear as if they have more depth I
should say and then I'm taking my Mac
blending brush and I'm just blending
this upwards
taking that same color and my Mac
eyeliner brush I'm just going to be
going over that same line with this dark
brown eye shadow then with this lighter
color I'm going to be applying that
right in the inner part of my lower lash
line at this point you can apply fake
lashes if you do want or you can use
your favorite mascara
mine is L'Oreal telescopic so you can't
be Pocahontas or an Indian for Halloween
and not have a nice bronze glow I'm
gonna be taking by Mac it's a skin
finish it's called gold deposit I'm
gonna be applying this right on my
cheeks and also on my forehead
her lips I'm gonna leave them very
neutral I'm using tawny by Jordana
cosmetics it's a lip liner that can get
at any drugstore and for lips i'm just
using the chapstick end of a Smashbox
lip stain that i have it's like a berry
color but it's very close to my natural
skin tone so you can really use anything
for lips I wanted to keep it pretty
natural because the whole look is kind
of like a natural Indian look it's
nothing too crazy so for those of you
who are being an Indian or Pocahontas
this year I hope that this helped and
for those who aren't don't be afraid to
try out this look because I think it's
perfect for a night out thank you all so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
soon
