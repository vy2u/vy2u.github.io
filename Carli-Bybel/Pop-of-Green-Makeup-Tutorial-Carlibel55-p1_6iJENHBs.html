learn in Hell things I learned because
my father left it's probably just as
well now I've been standing here all by
myself in the pouring rain I think
there's someone I should call right now
but I can't father name
hi everyone thank you for watching so if
you have been following me you saw that
I did make a second channel here on
YouTube it's youtube.com slash the inner
beauty Bible and also if you are already
following it you probably saw my two
videos that I had already posted which
was the Harlem shake video and the
bloopers video me and my friends had so
much fun making that as you could see if
you were watching it but this Harlem
shake thing was going viral all over
YouTube so I figured why not do
something a little fun and a little
different and the main reason why I made
my second channel was because I wanted
to do again different kind of videos
besides beauty and hair and I wanted to
open up more with you guys and show a
different side of myself to you guys in
this setting which is me teaching you
how to do hair and makeup it's basically
just me being a teacher and teaching my
students which are you guys and I love
doing that clearly because I've been
doing it for over a year now but I also
wanted to do a second channel because
for those of you who don't only want to
watch hair and makeup there's gonna be
all kinds of other stuff on there so I
do plan on posting another video this
weekend so please please please
subscribe if you haven't already so for
today's makeup look I'm gonna be showing
you how I got this nice pop of color and
I think it's a perfect look for
springtime and some are coming up I love
this emerald green color you want to
learn how I got my makeup please
watching prime my eye I'm just taking a
little bit of this concealer and I'm
just gonna be applying it all over my
eyes and any concealer or any eyeshadow
base you can apply it this time I do
like using concealer just because I
already have it and it's just really
easy to use and it's also a nude color
so it's gonna be perfect under any color
eyeshadow
first I'm using the lightest color in
this Maybelline quad and this one is
called give me gold this light beige
color is going to be going right on my
eyelid and also right under my eyebrows
from the same quad I'm then taking this
dark brown color with my Mac blending
brush and this is number 224 and I'm
just gonna be applying a little bit of
the brown right in my crease for this
look I'm not doing anything crazy
dramatic for the eyeshadow it is more
focused on the liner so once we get
there you'll see why
I want this makeup look yesterday and I
think at a lot of compliments that's why
I did decide to do a video on it but
yesterday I had barely any eye shadow
and I just did the line but I figured
for this look that you just add a little
bit extra for my eyeliner I'm using by
L'Oreal it's the infallible lacquer
liner and it's 24 hours and I'm using
blackest black and it looks like this
and it also comes with a little mini
brush with it I got these in a few
different colors I got the bronze and
the navy blue and the black so now I'm
just gonna be lining my eyes as I
normally would and again this is using
the black color when I do my eyeliner I
always start on the outer corner and I
always constantly will open up my eye
and I'll look straight ahead to see
where I want my eyeliner to be extended
to again remember you don't need to do
this in one easy step if you actually
take your time with it and do it more
neatly you'll get used to it and then
each time will become easier and easier
one thing I'll always do to get my
eyeliner perfect is I buy these q-tips
one and is pointy and one is like round
and these are perfect for our makeup and
makeup removal I like using the pointy
end just to make sure that the inner
part of my eyeliner is perfect I know a
lot of you have been asking how I get
the inner part so good well if it is a
little bit too thick just get one of
these little pointy ones and you can
just use a little makeup remover and it
comes right off
so now comes the fun part yesterday when
I was in Sephora one of the ladies who
worked there actually recognized me from
one of my videos which was really cool
and she was telling me about this new
product that was coming out and it
wasn't coming out till this weekend but
I just loved how it looked on her it was
just really really pretty green eyeliner
so I was asking her about it and she
told me she would let me try it out a
little early so I got to try it out and
I loved it I'm using the one that's a
little bit of a more of a shiny one it
comes with like a glittery one a matte
one and then this one's more like era
destiny and then this one yeah it has
like a nice like shine sparkle so I'm
gonna be using this one and I'm gonna be
drawing a line right over my black
eyeliner so again you're just gonna draw
a nice thin line right over the line you
had just done and don't worry if you
messed it up a little bit and you get on
the black part you can just go back over
it with the black
so next I'm just gonna be applying my
mascara I'm using L'Oreal telescopic and
carbon black as usual for this final
step I'm gonna be taking this yellow and
beige color and I'm gonna be applying it
right in the tear duct of my eye and
then I'm gonna be taking the darker
brown color and lining the outer part of
my eye
I swear every single time right right
when I'm just about to be them this has
to happen for lipstick I used myth by
Mac and it's just a nude color and this
one is definitely one of my favorites
and over that I use talks softly to me
by Mac and I know this one is a limited
edition but it's just like a nice peachy
nude color they do have a lot of them
that are very similar to it if you go in
and you tell them this name I'm sure
they'll tell you one that's very similar
that was an L limited edition so again
if you are in a budget and you're not
trying to buy the new eyeliners I do
have a video showing how you can make
your own colored liquid eyeliner I will
link that right below so definitely
check that out it's again you are on a
budget and you don't want to go out and
try this product so as you can see when
I look down you can see the green very
very distinctly but when I look straight
ahead and you just see a little bit of a
hint of green so I love that because it
really does make your eyes pop and
doesn't matter what color eyes you have
it will still make them stand out so I
hope this helped out a lot and for
everyone who tries it out best of luck
and I will see you guys soon make sure
again to please subscribe to my new and
you read on my love all suppose that
women like me might end up together it's
like wishing for rain as I stand in
desert
I'm holding you closer than</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
