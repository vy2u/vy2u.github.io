this year for Halloween jasmine was
definitely my number one requested
tutorials I knew I had to get this look
up for you guys it was a lot of fun to
recreate I think if I was being Jasmine
for Halloween I would probably wear my
hair down but I just wanted to show you
a quick easy way to do the little puppy
braid thing that she has as well so I do
plan on doing a lot more Halloween
tutorials if you guys want to see them
make sure to click like on the video
below and if you guys want to learn how
I did this Jasmine hair and makeup
please keep watching first color I'm
using is this white from my BH 120
palette and I'm just going to be
highlighting underneath my eyebrows
following that I'm picking up this white
sparkly beige sorry it's out of focus
but this is going to be going all over
my entire eyelid next I'm going to be
using this brand new palette from
bareMinerals and I'm picking up these
two pinkish brown colors they look a
little bit lighter on camera but they
are a bit of a darker pink in real life
and with this color I'm blending this
right into my crease with my Mac
blending brush
so the next part of the look I'm gonna
be drawing an eyeliner with this dark
brown matte color and this small shader
brush I'm also taking the edge of my
scrunchies it's going to help me create
a perfectly straight line the reason I'm
using eye shadow before the liner is
because I want to give it a thick
blended look and then following this I'm
going to be using my gel liner so now
I'm taking this dark brown gel liner and
I'm going to be lining a thinner line
along my lash line and then I'm going to
be taking a blending brush and just
blending that right into the eye shadow
picking up a little bit of this darker a
purpley plum shadow I'm then going to be
blending that right on the outer part of
my crease going back to that bare
minerals palette I'm actually picking up
this gold color and a little bit of the
one to the left and I'm going to be
lining my lower lash line this color I'm
going to focus on the inner part of my
eye and then I'm going to take that same
matte brown color and apply it on the
outer part then I'm going to be lining
my inner lash line with this black eye
pencil and this is just going to make my
eyes look a little bit more narrow
to line my lips I'm using by Jordana
cosmetics the color tawny and I'm
following that with the color your smile
nude lip gloss
from my BH blush palette I'm picking up
this bright pink blush and I'm going to
be applying it right onto the apples of
my cheeks
to achieve the Jasmine hairstyle the
first step that I do is tease the front
pieces of my hair
you
after you put in the headband you're
then gonna want to put your hair just in
a regular low pony and so I'm gonna be
Bobby pinning down my front pieces that
don't stay in since you just teased the
front parts of your hair when you pull
little pieces out of your ponytail it's
going to give it some body in the front
then you're going to grab a second hair
tie and place it in about two inches
below the first one and you're going to
slowly pull out little pieces of hair to
create a puffy look I'm wearing my 22
inch Bellamy hair extensions to help
give me the thickness of course that
happened where's my adorable has to ring
when I look like
definitely scared my postman but you're
going to do the same step with 1/3 hair
tie and you're all set so this is the
final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial and if you are being
Jasmine this year make sure to tag me so
I can see how your app it comes out and
the makeup and everything because I
would love to see it I will be doing a
bunch more Halloween tutorials so
definitely stay tuned and until next
time bye guys
