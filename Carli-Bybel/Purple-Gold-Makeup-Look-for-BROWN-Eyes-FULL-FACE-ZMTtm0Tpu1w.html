watching so I'm here today with my
beautiful sister Amanda and if you guys
don't know who this is I will link my
sister tag because we did a nice long
video for you guys if you want to go
check that out but I had posted a status
on Facebook asking if you guys wanted to
see a makeup look for someone with brown
eyes because I know a lot of the looks
that I do some of you are wondering if
it will look good on some with brown
eyes because I do have the blue eyes so
I stole my sister for the day and forgot
to film this beautiful look on her and
what do you think of it um well I
haven't wore this much makeup in I don't
even know how long and I am obsessed I
love it it's crazy I think I'm gonna
watch this video every single day and do
my like this all the time okay I'm going
on a date with my boyfriend after this
and he's gonna be knocked off his feet
yeah I can't wait that's like my
favorite thing when I do someone's
makeup and I get all like glamorous I'm
like oh someone else can see them but so
if you guys want to learn how to get
this beautiful dramatic purpley gold
fall makeup look please keep watching
and we will show you how to start off
this look I'm going to be using the
miracle blur and I'm going to be
applying that as a primer all over her
entire face
your friend is Oh
poor foundation I'm using by make up
forever the HD foundation and I'm going
to be applying this with my Mac 180
brush all over the outer part of her
face
and I'm not running
so dude
next by Mac I'm using my prep and Prime
in light boost and I'm going to be using
this to highlight underneath her eyes
also her nose and her chin
picture book secondly once you've
applied it I like blending it all in
with my Mac 188 brush and I blended in
to the foundation that I had just
applied
fill in her brows I'm using my whitening
lightening the brow bar to go and I'm
taking this darkest brown color
using that same dark brown color and my
Mac contour brush I'm then gonna be
contouring her cheeks also along the
sides of her face the sides of her nose
and her chin
you
the key to a flawless looking face is to
blend it in after each step
from the first edition 120 palette by BH
I'm picking up this bright purple color
and with my blending brush I'm going to
be blending this right in the crease of
her eye
for an eyeshadow base I'm just taking
this concealer and I'm applying it all
over my entire eyelids
pretty far
I'm going to be using fix+ to make my
gold eyeshadow pigment stand out even
more feel free to use eye drops for
water in the place of this but again
this is just going to help bring out the
pigment of the eyeshadow here a
bloodshot eyes the sole shitty
next I'm grabbing my grape pigment by
Mac and my pencil brush and I'm going to
be applying this shadow starting from
underneath my eye and dragging it out
into the outer V
doesn't feel girls
and you can get the
then I'm taking a little bit more of the
pigment on my blending brush and I'm
gonna be blending this right into my
crease
we all see
sometimes you
with the nine
and the non-event to line her eyes I'm
using this black gel liner from L'Oreal
I'm stolen glances at lives I can't
afford
I'm also lining her lower lashes with
the same purple color
and
I'm now going to be applying Lorimar CI
concealer all underneath her eyes and
also to highlight her face
to set the concealer I'm using this
brightening powder by Laura Mercier
I'm not sure
can't sleep
I know I know sure the thing I need a
sinner's prayer up toward to seem stars
that you see baby please come we're
going back to that same brow bar color
and I'm also picking up some of my
L'Oreal True Match in cocoa and this is
gonna just bronze and contour a little
bit more the woods to say from my BH
glamorous blush palette I'm going to be
taking this bright purple blush and I'm
going to be applying it right on her
cheeks to line her lips I'm using by
Jordana cosmetics the lip liner in the
color tawny I'm sure
and for lipstick I'm using myth by Mac
and this is gonna go all over her lips
to give it a shinier finish I'm taking
this peach colored lip gloss and I'm
applying it right over the lipstick it
reminded like a couch in on like a
restaurant website right no they're so
weird now look I'd really nice no-look
share the camera all right so this is
the final result
yay and she love this love it I think
it's honestly so amazing I can't wait to
try it on to myself for those of you who
are wondering this look is not only for
people with brown eyes if you have other
color eyes I dare you to go out and try
it because I'm sure it's gonna look just
as great on you but I wanted to do a
specific look for people with brown eyes
because golds and purples do look really
really great on brown eyes so we hope
you enjoyed this look and hope I sure
did oh yeah and she's about to go out on
her date so she's gotta go but thank you
