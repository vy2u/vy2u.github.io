excuse my voice because I am a little
bit sick I woke up with a cold yesterday
and I'm just not feeling so well so I
want to do a film a video for you guys
cuz it has been a little bit since I
posted on this channel if you guys
aren't aware I do have a second channel
where I post vlogs and inner beauty and
motivation videos so I will link that
below for those of you guys who never
saw that before
I just recently posted a vlog from my
trip to Tennessee so if you guys want to
check that out I will again link it
below it's been quite some time since
I've done a color series video and I
think my most requested has been purple
so as I was gathering products for this
look I was like pulling way too much
stuff so I figured I'm gonna just do
Purple's today and then the dark plums
I'm gonna stay for a different day
because I have a ton of really nice plum
stuff that I like but I think today
you're just going to stick with like the
Purple's the printerr Purple's the paler
Purple's everything like that also
really quickly I wanted to share that
these earrings are from ludora boutique
if so many of them and they're just so
beautiful they're like one-of-a-kind you
can get them all 10% off with my code
Carli bybel so I will list everything
below in the description box as usual
and yeah you want to see how I got this
makeup look as well as some of my
favorite purple products please keep
watching
you
so first I want to start out with purple
lip products because I think that is
what I have the most of I'm going to
just quickly talk about each one and
then show you guys swatches of all of
them so you can see them all in
comparison to each other the first one
is by Mac it's the Kelly Osbourne
lipstick it was the limited edition one
but I'm sure you can still find it on
Amazon it's called dodgy girl and it's a
beautiful purple shade I absolutely
loved how the casings were also purple
for these so of course I had to get this
one I also got the other shade which is
more of like a peachy color which is
also beautiful next I have two NYX
macaroon lipsticks these lipsticks are
so pigmented I was honestly so surprised
because I figured since they were so
expensive they were just going to be a
little bit more sheer but they actually
are so pigmented this one I would
definitely wear more than this one I
have tried this one but it's a little
bit more like a lavender shade but
they're both beautiful and they are in
the shade violet and lavender two more
drugstore lipsticks that I have are
violet by Milani and divine by
Maybelline so these are pretty similar
in color the millennia one is a little
bit of a deeper purple but they are both
beautiful shades and again these ones
are also really pigmented for drugstore
lipsticks so anyone who's telling me
that you can't find a nice drugstore
lipstick and lying to you
they're almost just as good as some of
the more expensive ones that I have so
it just really depends on what shade
you're looking for and just find the one
that suits you best
and the last purple shade was actually
one of my favorites for the summer time
this one's called love potion and this
one's by dose of colors and such a
beautiful purple shade so those are the
six lipsticks that I decided to show for
you guys because the ones that I've used
the most I think over the summer these
purple colors are a lot more popular but
I think hey why not why can't you bring
it into the fall time because all I'm
seeing lately are so many pastels being
brought into the fall in the winter and
I think you can really get away with any
makeup look or any lip color as long as
you just dress appropriately for the
weather I also have a few glosses and
lip glazes the first two are by la girl
and they are lip
it's the
I mixed two colors on my lips this one
and more like a pinkish tone which I'll
show you guys how I did it in the
tutorial but this one is called
whimsical and it's a really really
beautiful shade I love these lip paints
because they're really pigmented all you
do is just take a tiny bit on your
finger and you just dab it on your lips
and you just need a tiny bit like a
little bit goes a long way I promise you
that and the darker one is called coy
then I have two whitening lightening
glosses one is Wild Orchid and the other
one is bermuda so realistically the
Bermuda shade probably won't really wear
that much but if you guys are into funky
makeup or if you like just trying really
bold different colors these glosses are
just so ridiculously pigmented when I
show you guys the swatch of this you're
gonna be like oh my goodness this one
they also have like a turquoise a white
and a black shade that were like a
special edition that came out but they
are just so pigmented and amazing so if
you guys are looking for something
that's really rich in color and also
gives you a nice glossy finish these
glosses are great these glosses have
been my favorite for I'm going to say
like three years now they keep coming
out with new shades and each shade just
keeps getting better and better so these
purple ones of course I had to include
moving onto eyeshadows there were a few
different shadows that I used to create
this look that I'm going to share with
you guys as well as a few other
favorites the palette that I use for
this look was called wild child by BH
and I used these two purple colors at
the bottom I love these because they're
not your typical bright purple they're
more of like a mob
I never say that word writing off just
sounds weird mouth it may be its mouth
that might be the very way to say it but
yeah so they're more of like a purpley
pink instead of that bright rich purple
so I absolutely loved how pigmented
these ones are what I liked doing before
the mineral eye shadows is mmm sounded
like a mess right now
again I apologize um I like to dip my
brush into the fix+ and then use the
shadows and it just makes them come out
so much brighter and so much more
pigmented so that is definitely my trick
that I use especially for the mineral
eye shadows another shadow that I used
to create this look was by Sigma this
one is called gossip and it's a really
nice deep purple these Sigma shadows are
so pigmented I honestly for a while
never went to grab them because I tend
to always grab stuff that are in
palettes that way I can just kind of use
one palette to create my whole look but
for this look I actually used two of the
single shadows and I was so pleasantly
surprised at helping with that they were
I didn't even need to dip my brush into
anything to get it the color that I
wanted so I was actually again really
excited about these this one's amazing
another one I also used for this look is
by Mac the pigment violet these Mac
pigments I cannot talk highly enough
about I have almost every color they
never run out I feel like I've had this
one like they don't even making the nice
casings anymore and if I were to open it
and show you which I will really quick
you will see that it's still like
ridiculously full and I've used this so
many times I've had it so long so that
is one thing that I love about the Mac
pigment is they may be a little bit more
pricey but you're going to have them
forever and they are just so pigmented
they just really make your eyes pop and
that's what I use underneath my eyes
so of course I had to include my lower
lashes they are amazing I love the mink
lashes I'm wearing them right now I'm
wearing the girl you're crazy lashes
today but my absolute all-time
hands-down favorite lashes are the dummy
up I wore them to the CMAs and I also
wore them to my recent meet-and-greet so
I saw a couple people asking and again
they were the DA me up ones I have a 15%
off code for anyone interested so I will
link it below also they are made with
mink hair but there are no animals
harmed in the process so I've seen a few
people asking about that and if you go
on their website they have a whole story
about how the lashes are made and all
that good stuff so if anyone's in the
market for a nice pair of lashes these
are really great and you can get so many
uses out of them these ones right here I
actually had from before I even move to
my new house I like to keep them the
same boxes that they come in and then
just reuse them so these are so next I
have this purple hard candy primer it's
not actually purple it's more of like a
light lavender and I wanted to mention
this because I saw some people asking
questions about like color correcting
and they say to use a purple shade to
really brighten up dull skin if your
skin is looking a little bit gray so
this primer I use a few times in my few
recent videos and I really notice that
it helps brighten it up a bit if you're
doing a really dramatic look where
you're going to be putting on layers and
layers the primer color really doesn't
matter because it's just going to kind
of get lost throughout all the layers
but if you're doing something where
you're just gonna apply a primer
foundation and thrown a little bit uh
mascara this is going to help really
brighten up your face I of course had to
include my cleaning clear advantage acne
spot treatment I use this all the time
this is probably like my fourth one that
I've used it has the silicic done boom
no statistic salicylate salicylic right
is that how it's done I'm pretty sure I
know people cracked me all the time but
um that's why I bought it because I get
facials every once in a while and they
told me that if you get those little red
veins around your nose
I have like a broken of blood vessel up
here on my nose that this will help
treat it so I love this even just if I
have a pimple I'll just apply underneath
my foundation or at nighttime before bed
I always plot on pimples Bret always
comes in my room like where's that
little purple thing I need it and this
is what he's talking about so this is
great for those of you guys who have
some breakouts or just some maybe like
red spots or red veins this will really
help with that I have three purple
liners that I wanted to talk about the
first one is royally striking by Sigma
and it's a gel liner um
I absolutely you can tell I've used this
a bunch um I love gel liner usually I'll
just go for my black one but sometimes
to really make my eyes pop I'll just do
a purple liner in place of the black one
I also have two pencils one is by Milani
and it's called
perfect purple and the other one is from
BH party-girl and it is sorry I have my
window open you can hear all that noise
this one is called spin so I'm going to
again show you guys swatches of all
these but those were my top favorites as
far as that oh wait I have a lip liner
as well
this one's heroine by Mac and it's a
beautiful purple shade if you guys are
going to try out any of the lipsticks
that I mentioned it's good to get a
purple lip liner that's going to match
the shade so it can help really make
your lips look larger and help really
accentuate them make em look nice and
perfect so this is the one that I always
tend to use as far for any of those
lighter colors
and the last product is model on a
bottle and this is the sensitive skin
and makeup setting spray and this is
probably like my fifth bottle of this
you can see it's like almost empty I
love the one for sensitive skin because
my skin is pretty sensitive they have an
original formula that I've just really
never tried I now know that they come in
newer bottles so once I finish this
bottle off I'm going to go get the new
bottle of course so it may look a little
bit different the one that I'm linking
for you guys but this has been my
all-time favorite makeup setting spray
it's the one that I found works the best
out of all the ones that I have and it
has a little purple writing on it so of
course I had to include it so that is
really it as far as oh wait no I'm sorry
one more thing um my glamorous blush
palette has this beautiful purple shade
I think this is really the only purple
blush that I had so of course I had to
use it for this look it's just very
subtle I guess it doesn't really look
that purple on your face which is good
most people don't really use purple
blushes but I wanted to include it
because this one and the other ten color
blush palette are my favorites I love
the palettes because you can really just
bring one away with you and then you
have a whole bunch of colors and you
don't have to worry about packing a
bunch of individuals so if you guys love
the palette these are really really
affordable and I backed them up 100% so
that is it as far as my favorite purple
beauty products I have so many purple
nail polishes so I didn't want to go
through them all and try and pick my
favorite I mean any color you go with
are going to be great I love Essie
sinful colors umm salon perfect all
those like normal brands you can find
right in your drugstore they have
amazing purple shades so just the
pinning and the color you're going for I
guess go check it out and really can't
go wrong with that so I'm going to put
all of these swatches not only in this
video but also on my blog as well as
other pictures I hope you guys enjoyed
this video again it's been a little bit
since I've done the color series video
but please comment below and let me know
what color you would like to see next I
will be doing a tutorial where I do a
plum a darker plum lip so I will share
some of my favorites in that video
because
figured this videos going to be long
enough with all the purple shades as is
so I'm going to save the plums and the
darker purples for a separate video I
love you guys so much I leave for LA
tomorrow morning and I don't get home
till Sunday so let me know if you guys
want me to vlog again because I had so
much fun in Tennessee vlogging for you

gonna be a nice long weekend but as soon
as I get back I promise I'm gonna be
back on my grind with my videos the past
few weeks have just been absolutely
crazy and then I got sick yesterday so I
was planning on filming another video
