today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this smoked out fall inspired
makeup look I've seen a ton of requests
for some fall looks and although we are
still in the summer not gonna lie I'm a
little bit excited for fall so I was
excited to film this video for you guys
I love the vampy dark smoky looks that
come around with fall so if you want to
learn how I got it please keep watching
to start off this look I'm using my BH
party girl palette and I'm picking up
this dark purple color with a blending
brush and I'm applying this on the outer
V of my eye I didn't apply a eyeshadow
primer because I have concealer on my
eyes so I didn't find it necessary the
reason that I'm using this concealer
with the straight edge is to get a
perfect line and to help prevent any
fallout from getting on my face since I
did do my face before this look with
that same blending brush I'm picking up
this bright purple color and I'm
applying that right over the dark purple
shade
with that same dark purple color and a
pencil brush I'm applying this on the
inner third of my eye I'm splitting my
eyelid into three sections as you can
see because the right eye is already
done so I'm just applying this very
lightly in the inner part and then I'm
going to go on to a more gold shade
I'm picking up this gold shade and I'm
applying this right in the middle
I just wanted to apply this color before
I apply the pigment underneath to make
it really pop that way it just gives it
a little bit more dimension
then I'm picking up a little bit of this
makeup forever pigment I'm first dipping
my brush in my fix+
and I'm just applying that right over
that bronze shade that I had just done
and as you can see this pigment is
amazing it just really really makes your
eyes pop I'm grabbing a little bit of
this really dark matte purple and I'm
applying that just any outer V of my eye
and you're going to want to blend that
into the other Purple's that you already
used for liner I'm using my favorite
which is the ink liner by Kat Von D
and four lashes I'm using the doll me up
lashes by the lore moving back to my
eyes I'm taking a little bit more of
that matte purple shadow with a pencil
brush just to accentuate the crease a
little bit more and then I'm just
blending it out with a blending brush
now we're moving onto the lower lash
line I'm using that same purple color
and I'm splitting the lower lash line
into three sections as well so you want
to do the purple on the outer and the
inner and then the gold in the center
after you apply your mascara feel free
to add any more shadow if you want it a
little bit darker that's kind of what
I'm doing right here but that is it as
far as eyes so now I'm moving on to the
rest of my face I am bronzing up my face
with Lobell glow bronzer by Mac
and for blush I'm using by Mac pedal
power
the
and then to highlight my face i'm using
laura geller gilded honey highlighter
for the dark purple lip I'm using
cyberworld by Mac to line them be
careful when you're lining them if you
mess up it's definitely very hard to get
it off of your face so just take your
time with it and fill in a little bit of
your lips as well
a mixing two liquid lipsticks for this
look I'm mixing trust issues along with
potion
after I mix them together I'm just going
back with that same liner and I'm gonna
fill it in a little bit just to give it
like an ombre look
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video make sure to
thank this video up if you guys are
excited for fall - the whole pack school
part I hope you guys enjoyed and until
next time I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
