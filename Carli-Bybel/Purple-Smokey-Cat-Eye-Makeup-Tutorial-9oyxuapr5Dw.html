today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this purple smokey cat eye look
this look is perfect for a night out
whether it be date night or a night out
with your girls so I hope you guys enjoy
this video and if you want to learn how
i got this makeup look please keep
watching to start off this look I am
using the Smashbox double exposure
palette I'm picking up this matte nude
shade and I'm applying that all over my
eyelid using my pencil brush I'm picking
up this deep plum color and I'm grabbing
something with a straight edge like this
and I'm going to apply this eyeshadow as
if I were applying eyeliner it's going
to go out and I wing the shape
pick up a little bit of this bright
purple pigment with the same brush I'm
then applying that right over the darker
color and I'm gonna make it blend so I'm
just basically leaving it like this for
now then I'm going to apply my liner and
then I'm going to go back and blend so
you just want to basically make your
eyeshadow look like a thick eyeliner so
next I'm moving on to liner I'm using by
Smashbox the new photo angle pure
pigment gel liner I've used this
eyeliner in a few different colors but
for this look I decided to go with the
color plum I loved how pigmented these
liners are going to give you the same
intensity of a gel liner but it's going
to be really easy to apply just like a
magic marker eyeliner this liner is
waterproof and it's also transfer proof
they say that it will last up to 36
hours so one thing that I notice after
wearing this for a long time is that it
doesn't crack like some of the gel
liners when they dry out so I'm loving
this right now and especially with the
warmer weather coming it's always good
to find great liners that stay on
throughout the day to keep these liners
nice and fresh when you finish it make
sure you wipe off any excess gel that's
on it that way it's nice and clean and
you're good to go for next time I'm
picking up a little bit more of that
dark plum color and I'm going to start
blending it I'm then grabbing a blending
brush and this is where I'm going to
start blending the colors into my crease
that way it's going to still give it
that dramatic cat eye look but it will
also give you the benefits of making
your eyes appear larger by adding some
of the darker shades right into your
crease I picked up a little bit more of
that pigment with the same blending
brush and you're just going to keep
letting it until you are happy with how
dark it is and how blended it looks
you
once you put on your lashes you can
apply the two purple colors that we've
been using on the lower lash line
I'm picking up a little bit of this
silvery shimmer color and I'm applying
it right in the inner third of my eye as
well as under my brow before the video
started I did contour and highlight my
face so I'm just adding a little bit of
bronzer to warm up my face and then
following that I'm adding a bright pink
blush
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video please comment
below and let me know what videos you

love you so much and until next time
