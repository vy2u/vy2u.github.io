video I hope you continue to watch to
learn how to do it yourself first using
a concealer stick you're just going to
put a little bit on your finger and put
this all over your eyelid and this is
going to help keep on the shadow all day
first I'm going to be using a pearly
white color and I'm going to be applying
it all over my eyelid as well as
underneath my brow bone
next using a small pencil brush and a
black eyeshadow I'm going to be forming
up a derby on the outside of my eyelid
going to be dragging this line about
halfway across your eye and blending in
the outer corner of your eye
next someone be using a blending brush
and a pinkish color from my Celia 120
makeup eyeshadow palette you're going to
very lightly blend this into the crease
of your eye right above or the black
engine
next taking a dark purple color you're
going to be also using the blending
brush and it blends right in the crease
blending upward to the pink color and
downward into the black color
going back to the same black eyeshadow
I'm going to be then applying the black
right above where the purple was right
in my crease doing this in a swift
upward motion to blend all the colors on
my eyelid together
using the frozen white pigment by Mac
I'm going to be using a little bit of
that right on the inner part of my
eyelid this is going to give my eye a
little bit of a sparkle to it and also
make my eyes appear brighter
you
then I'm going to be lined my eyes with
a I penciled by Jordana cosmetics it is
a liquid I pen and it's a lot easier to
use in any other pens that I have used
before
you're also going to want to line your
lower lash using a small pencil brush or
else you're going to be taking back the
same black color and going right over
that black line underneath your eyes
then apply your mascara
you
I used to lipglosses when I had done my
lips they're both by Revlon and one of
them is called rose gold or rose and
that is the peachy air color and the hot
pink color is actually called hot pink
by Revlon as well I apologize for my
voice in this video I've been sick and I
lost my voice the past couple days I did
have a long birthday weekend so I
promise you I'll be updating as many
videos as I can this week thank you so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
