whisper challenge challenge we did the
challengers on so we figured we'd do a
QA because it's been a really long time
since we've done a QA I tweeted and I
also posted on my facebook to ask
whatever questions that you want to know
so we're going to try and get through as
many as possible so you're ready to
charge I'm Judith are you guys ready all
right so the first question is from
Twitter Becca wants to know what is our
favorite like ultimate favorite meal to
eat / prepare together I don't want her
going to eat / prepare together I mean
your favorite meals salmon so she
usually will boil and should usually
boil like a pasta or rice usually takes
care of that side of the dish and I'll
do the salmon and the veggies and all
that stuff yeah he's the cook in the
house yeah I kind of want to learn how
to make sushi because it's called love
sushi that'd be awesome I've learned
they have classes yeah yeah we should
totally take it's like something that
you love most yeah I like eating it
every day yeah she got me into like
being the sushi addict you're like a
burger attic all of a sudden I just love
burgers I mean I order them in the
healthiest way possible so you know I'm
in the gym a lot so guys want to gain
some weight out there like me either
burgers or if you're trying to lose
weight like me because I've been
slacking yeah he wants a smash burger
and I was so hard for me to be like I
can't get burger so he got me a chicken
chicken certainly avocado how about
chicken avocado sandwich chicken -
delicious avocado sandwich
I like on salary Elly wants to know name
two things you like about each other
that you wish you had I definitely wish
I had your work ethic I was pointing to
business peeps peeps I don't have one I
wish I had one there's a fun hey we do
those two things I'm one each showing me
how does he things other I mean no no I
would like them looking at you like
trying to see if I find but I don't I
don't want to have any of your girl
parts I just wish I had some of your the
good qualities that make you the amazing
person you are like your work ethic and
your caring this and know just the way
you carry yourself it's really good
why are you guys watching this right
because she's pretty good for she does I
guess okay um and then what else would I
want from you of yours I would love
fishing for compliments
it's okay Japan I love this dimple Emily
you would like to know how do you stay
healthy and positive towards reaching
your goals I think our biggest thing
like them like obsessed with and that
like kayln with that is like mental
strength yeah like working on our mental
selves and I think that helps keep
everything else in line we've been like
meditating lately and I know it sounds
like some people like it's so weird but
it's really not because like you might
be doing something throughout the day
where you don't realize what you're
meditating whether it's when you're in a
shower thinking to yourself or you're in
the gym something like that so that's
something that we like to do is I shut
everything off all of our phones all
that crap and we kind of put on like
either like really meditating type music
or like the sky she was she hasn't a
place yeah puts us to sleep every single
night
yeah talked about it it's if you guys
are looking for a good app I've
downloaded so many and this one is the
one that I always go back to it's
relaxing sleep well and the guy's name
is Glen Glen Harold oh yeah always ever
you just ridiculous it's like hypnosis
yeah I used to be a I used to not be
able to fall so good TV and lately I'm
realizing that I'm not good for me
because I'm not how to play I'm getting
the best sleep so I've been really
working on in trying to do this type of
stuff to better it and I'm getting so
much better to sleep with without TV I'm
putting it to this type of like
meditating sleep so it's it's really
really good it helps me and I'm a
restless sleeper so yeah I was gonna say
and for you because for me I don't know
if I've always been like this
I'm the type where I can get into bed
clear my mind and just kind of fall
asleep where I know you I don't know if
you still do it but you you tend to
think a lot right before bed yeah yeah
so like meditating helps you just clear
your mind of everything and just focus
on like your breathing and just
everything like that and then once you
kind of get into the state it just sends
out positive affirmations just to remind
you of to get in like a deeper conscious
level so you really recommend meditation
your guys Cheyenne wants to know if
there was going to be a movie on how you
two met who would you want to play your
who would you want to play guys oh okay
rachel mcadams I love Rachel McAdams
everything she then I just obsessed
so I guess rachel mcadams right um I'm
like a tie to I like to favorite actors
that are just so it's not even because
they're like yells leo and Johnny Depp
yeah just because they're they're so
good at what they do and I just know
that they would like literally yes find
a way not exactly like do it perfectly
everywhere it's them
Alexandra wants to know what do you love
and hate most about each other what I
love most about you is how big strong
yet comforting you are like my favorite
thing like every single day I'd never
won leaves if you're just with your big
arms wrapped around me Mila Glenn in
your chest and you just
playing even my hair something I
literally feel like that piece like
nothing in the world could be wrong me
to slay them oh so that's what I love
most about you you make you feel like
yeah you do
there's million other things going on to
the dancer and then what do I hate about
you
I hate I dislike sometimes smelly my
boobs are that's a definitely so leaning
this way I okay I just like when he
poops and leaves the door open and
doesn't even have the courtesy to shut
the door trap to smell because it starts
floating on the ground because I've
already flushed by the time I poop
that's why he has this is so gross but
like we need a flush place and just your
bonus poo pourri
you don't have me to use it ken doesn't
give me any options guys what does she
want the guy to do we got a poop I know
just shut the damn door with a little
fan I do is the chemical sprays I mean I
mean yeah I try all right now what do
you love and hate about them you look
like you're about to say something much
deeper than my smelly poop so I want to
know what you're 11
yeah because I saw all that no it's not
too late I gave you this really prove it
what was your answer because it looked
super deep you're reaching far down
inside operating to pull that up I just
like sometimes how sometimes which it
means all the time in our language we
just leave it that no no why because
they have to see a real answer you were
about to pull out something sometimes
you're annoying how that isn't happen
that's what she couldn't say that I'm
annoying listen your boyfriend doesn't
annoy you they don't love you just know
that seriously the out of you
they don't really love you because the
reason i annoy her is because I care
about certain things and I'm not anal
I'm not trying to nitpick it's just that
certain things should be done a certain
way in a guy's perspective right and
sometimes women don't really meet up to
that and which is comes to be annoying
somehow which is fine I'm okay I'm
totally good with being annoying I'm
finally being annoying exactly so they
don't annoy a that's not real love
what I love hate about you I love that
you make me feel like everything's okay
at all times literally anything to
happen and I just know everything to be
good because I got her you know and the
thing I hate the most about yelling and
it's two years later I think we've
answered this the bottle cap situation
really every single bottle used in the
house is unpacked now I had this weird
phobia about things falling into my
drinks like I don't like to have an open
drink at night when I go to sleep it
needs to be capped or some type of water
bottle because I don't want like you
know there's dust in the air and these
like particles that we can't see that
are falling right at the tip now is this
something we always think about no this
is why people drink open drinks and they
don't care things need to be capped and
this girl does not cap anything I really
really got to fight about it last night
it wasn't even a fight it's like
you put that cap on after you have
trying get I'm like I'm still drinking
it though say about boys universities is
that exactly how I said it's all I said
yes you did damn if you're gonna share
my drink just just put the cap on it
because I don't want to drink okay so
what about this big so obviously every
sinner and Alex wants to know what
advice would you give a couple who wants
to move in together also love you guys
love you um what kind of a first one
because I do one for every day no matter
okay so I know like nowadays depending
on your culture or your background like
a lot of people still won't move in with
anybody until after marriage which I
respect that if that's the way that
you've been raised but I think and we
say this all the time like we moved in
together before we were even officially
dating and I think it was probably one
of the best things that we could have
ever done because and we literally know
every single thing about each other
because there's something to hide living
together for over two years now so
that's a like the one main thing and the
second main thing is that we kind of get
like a test run of what it's going to be
like if we get married so I think it's
an amazing thing if you're going to move
out regardless instead of splitting
right with a friend or something or just
a stranger why not move in and split
right with each other like I think it's
important that you guys at least are
splitting it and both putting your time
and energy into it it's going to be like
a both fear type of thing you're not
making sense
no yeah so I guess I recommend it yeah
anybody really got it early shopping for
a car you can take your test but I'm
going to choose your charm motivation
it's like it's the same thing you don't
go into something thinking one thing and
then you do it and then it's completely
opposite then you're going to be in a
situation that you
yeah but another thing I would say is
that I need to have the ability to
things patience and sacrifice like you
have to sacrifice your time and you have
to sacrifice your patience at certain
certain areas and it's not to the point
where you're like killing yourself over
it it's not bad it's not a bad to
sacrifice or a bad to be patient it's
not in those types of ways but it's just
like finding how to kind of be selfless
with your actions it needs to be that
inner motivation to always want to
sacrifice and accept the way the other
person is regardless and at all times
and have the patience to talk figure
things out kind of work through things
because you know as happy as we always
look and we are I mean like I wouldn't
be saying this if it wasn't real it's
just as many times when we've had a
situation where we've conflicted where
we work it out by ourselves and it's not
anything crazy you'd be so surprised
it's like the smallest stuff but it's
it's good because it helps us figure
each other out more like you need to
make these mistakes in order to like
figure out the right process and then
never make those mistakes again that you
have to make those mistakes so I think
that's a big part of it you know
alright sacrificing your chances that's
a great question because really really
quick Nancy wants to know I want to know
so bad of ear to finger touching so I
know once is love but can't figure out
the other one is it two hearts um so the
first I only have two tattoos I think
I've talked about this in other videos
but throw it in there really quick you
don't have any tattoos that's a boy
so the first one that I got is this one
on my finger all zoom in so you guys can
see it it's an open heart so it's kind
of like well is basically like I don't
guys have seen the commercials for Kay
Jewelers if your heart is always open
we'll find its win um I actually got
this hat to you when I was going through
a lot in my life I would move down to
Florida for a little bit with my dad and
that was when I got this one
and it was kind of a reminder to myself
to not give up on finding love and to
being happy because I was kind of just
like in a really bad place so this was
my little reminder to keep my heart open
and Lovell find its wedding which it did
so that's what that one is and then this
one just says love so want to tell me
what you want to do well on the ring is
yeah it's on my right thing or two I'll
just close it here what's like close the
heart
yeah because loves found its way and no
one else is coming doors closing doors
close we want to do a giveaway show make

what are you going to get married each
other don't push it okay I'm not pushing
no no no I'm saying like no person
should push me out it's just because
everybody else listen just because
everybody else it to marry everybody
else has to do all the same ring of
events does it mean it needs to be
exactly the same
not rush something that's worth it it's
all inside you know not it's not because
I don't want to be with her it's just
things that are never good when you move
too fast right I think good comes out it
would be too fast so that's
don't you are you it's coming Karen
wants to know for what in your life do
you feel the most grateful boy good
question cutter Thanks I'll go first
I'm most grateful for all my mistakes
that I've made up to this point because
every single thing I've done has led me
to being right here talking to you and
like it's this past couple years I've
learned how to like take negative and
turn into positive and I feel like
that's just like the foundation is all
the mistakes I've made in my life have
led me to the path of you and like life
and being this way and it's like you're
right you know you right where you want
to be happy so it's like I'm happy for
all the things I did wrong because if I
did those things right I might not be
here so I'm grateful for that almost so
grateful for her because she's an
amazing person it makes me so happy it
really just is that like power that I
really need more
to say without her I wouldn't be happy
but it's just good to have somebody like
that to make you feel good here
you know
that's what I'm feeling I feel most
grateful for all of you guys and I know
that might sound cliché but when I
first started youtube I had no idea like
what I was getting myself into or
anything like that I was basically just
living each day without even
understanding like what the hell was
even going on in my own head and I think
through like YouTube and through
interacting with you guys like I found
myself and I found my purpose and I
found what makes me happy and I mean I
think I mentioned a lot of this in my
draw my life video like just you guys
got me into such a place where I felt
like important and I felt like they were
relying on me and it kind of like lifted
me off out of this like just this mood
and the stage of my life that I was in
and I think through all of that is what
helped me and him get together even
because of me finally just focusing on
myself trying to make myself happy not
always constantly looking for it
elsewhere that's when I found you and
that's when our whole relationship
started I really don't think like we
would have ever worked out if like if I
didn't do this whole YouTube thing I
mean I would have hoped maybe but like I
just feel like I found out who I was and
I found out like what's important like
to be a good person to do good on others
and I just feel like ever since I made
that change and I just only did good for
people and just spread positivity and
all that stuff I just have seen
everything in my life change and
everything around me become positive and
I literally oh everything to all of you
guys so thank you I'm so grateful for
you and I don't know if I say it enough
but I love you guys
Dianna wants to know how do you guys
manage to overcome any argument / by use
y'all are perfect yes I love you
I love you oh yeah I love y'all
I love you when I went to Texas for a
wedding I actually started saying young
people were making fun of me I was like
I can't help it I just love it I feel
like we've never had like a big blowout
fight happily oh and let me haven't had
like a big big photo for the gift stupid
little Piper
yeah it's me it's just fights about like
honestly because we had that like we
probably had a couple fights where it's
been like I will kind of never really
felt that way in a fight before or that
fights kind of went little differently
than the ones before but they never
happen after that it's like we get that
we get through it because you talk like
I'm the one community he didn't
communicate it would be bad because I'm
just so stubborn and I like to speak to
myself and think about my own yeah
like no fear like the problem figure it
out yeah let's get the problems
let's kill even once we figure out the
problems we'll talk in extra like half
hour just to make sure like we cleanse
our minds yeah because I feel like
talking it's the best I understand
that's the number one thing and I think
that's what so many people don't realize
they're always like well what's the key
to making a relationship work and what's
this my sentence the notion ending is
wish to get listening and communicating
because people can hear you but do they
really go listen and that's the question
yeah do they listen to you hear you do
that that's the key you need to look for
that at any type of companion it's big
cuz the worst feeling is like when
you're talking to somebody and you're
passionate about it and either they cut
you off or like they don't you just
notice that they're nothing actually
thing that's so funny that's like the
biggest pet peeve when someone is just
deliberately annoying I mean excuse me
deliberately ignoring you what you're
trying to like talk in a way where it's
like you know what what you're saying is
important to you but to them it's it's
so rude and it makes you feel a certain
way so don't such a people like you
can't change them so yeah they're going
to be everywhere in your life just
realize those are the type of people
bringing - a lot it's not you it's more
or less than ya always find someone who
could listen because this is one of the
most important qualities in a Andrea
wants to know Carly do you ever get
jealous when you see girls commenting on
Brett saying he's hot no it's so funny
because I think if we didn't do what we
did and we were just in a normal
relationship because we were normally we
weren't like a relationship before
YouTube and everything like that it just
never worked I used to be so jealous are
you kidding like this little scrumptious
food anytime so I'm gonna look like that
wouldn't love but now I feel like I'm
just so confident in our relationship
and I'm confident in him I know what
kind of person he is so I'm not worried
on it at all I personally like I want
people to find you attractive because
it's helping your career and blah blah
blah no no no I really don't get jealous
I think you get more jealous I'm
pretends not like on Instagram person is
some of them Oh in person I'm not gonna
piss I just don't like people who are
bad no no that's not rude because we but
I could deal with when you're
disrespectful yeah I mean it's different
you have to draw the line somewhere but
I mean I don't I don't fish for
attention with my pictures I feel like
it's just really correlate stood to
fitness and stuff like yeah and when
like my shirtless pics like I wouldn't
do it because I tell them I'm like you
shirt off like I try to wear shirts oh
yeah I can't get out like sometimes I
know in the offseason I do not look the
same as I do or this summer because of
my ties different you know I cut more so
like when I was doing well my winter
workouts inside like I definitely had a
hard time editing them because I'm my
worst critic but like looking at me
shirtless I'm like Jesus I look like I
don't look as good as I did in the
summer
she'd be like puffs what are you talking
about like shut up you look so good more
blah and I find myself saying the same
thing to her because I think everybody's
their own worst critic especially when
it's an image-based
you know livelihood
everybody's a judgmental in today's
world in social media all that goes into
one so to be able to cope with that I
think is an important thing that's
something that fit need her both work
with each other on which is really good
yeah you know it's good to have someone
else's you know opinion even though
she's might be his fame I'm her biggest
fan a little bias but still just good to
know those things yeah I just like one
thing when you're really confident in
each other and your relationship
the jealousy kind of disappears I mean
sometimes media I don't get jealous like
if we're out somewhere and I see girls
staring but sometimes I'll be like what
the hell and they see me standing right
here but you know what you're a
beautiful human being look at you I just
said is it what guys do times a million
like every guy and girls you know it if
you have a boyfriend and you're you're
gorgeous or something to look at you
know and a guy's going to look and
whether however your boyfriend reacts is
going to tell you whether they're
jealous or not if he's defensive with it
then you're gonna be you're gonna know
he's jealous he feels threatened find
out why you know straight you know why
what's that insecurity you know what's
the issue there because at the end of
the day I look at a guy looking at her
and I'm like thanks I mean that just you
basically telling you what your body
language that you think she's pretty or
she taught ladies a good test for your
guy have a guy look at you right or like
make eye contact just just for a second
see how your boyfriend reacts because
that will tell you yeah cuz if he
doesn't care at all that might not be
able to do that right because we've
established part relationship if someone
was looking at be like I would probably
want to know how she felt if like
someone was looking at her and I saw her
smile something I'd be like whoa why
it's not gross that I'm like oh my god
the guy just like really something
inappropriate even now you would protect
trunk
like you just seeing eyes and bother all
right it's move on um Alicia wants to
know the reason his public's have you
ever thought about breaking up and why
and then someone comments the best
question and if she said she didn't
she's lying
I mean maybe like sometimes wink but I'm
just I don't know I really can't ever
picture my life with anyone else like I
feel like I got one-in-a-million like I
feel like there's no guys like Han like
he's just everything that I've ever
wanted like crumbled into one and it's
definitely have thought about you had no
no I'm saying you I've definitely
thought about I don't need this or like
we have a fight though like this stress
like sometimes right maybe like more
towards the beginning when I was still a
little unsure but now I just like like
as much as we fight over like dumb
stupid things like I never I'm like I'm
gonna break up with him over and it's
like nothing that he does is ever like
to an extent where I'm like oh my god
this isn't where I'm not really like
deal with this like I know basically
every single thing about him and like
I'm okay I was handling it and dealing
with whatever that is when you're
finding out a lot about the other person
you're with I think there's a lot of
that during that stage where you cut up
like battling with yourself on is this
is the right thing am i doing
you know when you're like new at
something or it's like some type of new
experience you're kind of is this what I
want to do is just really good like a
new job to me it's kind of like that and
at the beginning it was kind of like me
batting myself about what would life be
like if I wasn't dead and take this
route and I knew every little second was
that every little time I thought about
that I knew like no no don't think that
way because you're so much better with
this person in your life she makes you a
better person you make her a better
person everyone keeps asking will just
answer is really like when are you
having babies well we've waited this
long so we're gonna get married first
which I'm not an H so I'm gonna assume
maybe like five four or five years we
start having kids and we want a boy we
would love to have a boy person that a
girl he done find out there though is
just like now we're definitely having a
girl and then or we're gonna have two
boys and you just never know so yeah I
look like anything this answer how
beautiful if they love us
merhaba let's do an impression of each
other hey guys today I'm back with
