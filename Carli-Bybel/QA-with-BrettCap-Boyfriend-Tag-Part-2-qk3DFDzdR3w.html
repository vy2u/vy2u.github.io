today I'm here with my handsome booba
Brett and we are going to be answering
some questions I had posted a status on
Facebook and asked what you guys wanted
to know so I'm going to just go through
the list and we're going to be answering
some questions for you guys
so if you want to learn a little bit
more about us then please keep watching
hey hey hey hey I don't care what buzz
says what was oh we should we tell him
what Bubba means a lot of people are
asking what Bush oppas
but this well that's funny because when
we first if she started dating were like
we need a cute nickname for each other
and he was like how about bets and I was
like I wasn't beps it was just like
saying hey babe it's like hey a bets a
bet
that you know that's what I didn't like
that I would laugh every time I did it
it was like oh so now it's just the
bucks no because at first I would be at
work and a caller I'd be like papa and
she like Papa and that's what we would
do it but Papa so that's where it came
from and you can make fun of me now
yeah okay so the first question is from
Jessica Liotta socha I um
she wants to know this one I'll let you
answer are you guys ever gonna get
married you guys will have such cute
babies of course you're gonna get
married come on who wouldn't marry this
alright girls it's okay you could be
honest she's amazing
of course when to marry her can't wait
to have babies we talk about all the
time it's a constant topic of
conversation just not yet not yet
obviously we're being patient but I told
you guys I think maybe in the boyfriend
tag video or something I think there was
a question asked it's like I don't I
would never have went into a
relationship not thinking that that
would ultimately be you know the plan
the moment I laid eyes on this girl I
knew and it just took me a little while
to realize you know you mature and I
explained that already yeah but yeah
they're coming out of the womb with a
football on their hand we're a big giant
bow or a big giant penguin all right
next question Barbara
Oh Barbara my grandma's barber and his
mom is Barbara
oh hi Barbara um Barbara wants to know
what kind of makeup look does Brett like
on you the question is for you this
one's for me I guess for a way to me
explain this is every day I wake up next
to this girl and I always say to her how
do you look so good in the morning
because basically she shuts her eyes at
night and this is after she takes all
her makeup off cleans up you know for
bed just the most genuinely gorgeous
girl obviously inside and out there's a
few pictures she took on Instagram like
you would see if she says no makeup but
that's like the one picture I'm thinking
in my mind she was in the car we were in
Walgreens and he took a picture waiting
for me she turns up black I remember oh
that's what it's the most fresh face
without makeup I've ever seen inside
thank 1o percent guaranteed fresh fresh
top brush
Mina tell about yourself
this one has 138 likes what is the
funniest and what is the most funniest
an embarrassing moment that has happened
in front of each other
funniest moment we've had I would say
there's a million funny moments the
little voices we do to each other I mean
those are like that's like constantly
every day like seriously one day hmm I
know the funniest well nervous and
you're gonna agree with this so you know
the photo booth on Mac computers oh my
god so whenever we're really bored we'll
just sit there and we'll put it on the
video record and we'll do the ones with
like the funny faces and like depending
on which one we do we have certain
characters and I don't know in the
moment we just sit there like ramble on
and watching them back like how many
times we almost pair of hands yeah
microphone oh they didn't yeah no I'm
good like improving and Sochi so like
basically we came up with a couple Glenn
Glenn Glenn England and the way that the
I guess the filter on the computer makes
your face look just makes it so funny
maybe if you guys are lucky one day I
would share it with you but well Glenn
and Gwen is like the cute little muffin
II old given us yeah so when we're like
old and her back that's gonna be us yeah
I'm Batterson woman the only thing that
I could personally think of that was
embarrassing what which really isn't
embarrassing anymore because we lived
together every day so I mean anything
that you're gonna try and hide is
impossible after certain amount of time
but I remember in the beginning when we
first moved in together
I would never burp in front of him and I
know this is this is really gross and
I'm sure some of you're going to be like
a oh girl shouldn't burp but my mom and
my sister can tell you like I can burp
like no other like the house almost
shakes and it's so disgusting but for a
while like he never heard it and then
one time I accidentally just like let it
out yeah but nothing is embarrassing
when you're in love because that's not
what matters there's nothing that your
counterpart should do to make you think
otherwise by a normal life thing just
because you aren't you know you're never
there to see it in the first hand
everybody is a human being
does the same stuff so never let that
come in between you and your counterpart
because that's just complete BS and it
shouldn't ever be a problem so so Myra
wants to know hi by the way what is the
key to having a healthy friendly
relationship from each other's point of
view why don't you answer this one me
yeah cuz I'm answering okay so I think
there are certain things in my opinion
that are required to have a healthy
relationship obviously number one being
that you can be best friends with the
person you're dating because at the end
of the day you're spending most of your
time with them and you have to learn how
to be yourself around them and you need
to learn how to have fun with each other
because that's what's going to keep it
going I think communication is also tied
at number one because if I have
something bothering me or if I feel a
little certain way about something if I
don't communicate it with him he's not
going to know girls are very emotional
creatures and sometimes he'll do
something and in my head I'll see it one
way and he'll see it a completely
different way and if I just sit there
I'll let it libro' in my head and I'll
get pissed off and then I'll end up like
exploding later on so I think one thing
that we realized that is so important is
yeah whenever anything is bothering you
come to the person tell them about it
and he's so easy like if I ever have any
kind of problem like he listens to what
I have to say and he actually takes it
into consideration and actually like
will change like oh yeah no like um yeah
ya know so basically when your
counterpart is feeling a certain way
make sure that you know because you need
to adapt to that situation at the time
so nothing bad comes out of that and
you're not saying the wrong thing that
could set something off that you know
could start a fight or something and
that's like the formula we use and it's
worked and it's great because I don't
hide myself and she doesn't hide herself
and even if she does or I do sometimes
we both get it out of each other and we
learn from it and you move on because
you grew up the relationship you don't
just go through it you have to grow so
so Miranda wants to know how do you guys
get through rough patches in your
relationship do you have any tips that
you guys have that have worked for you
um yeah oh good question um I mean we
haven't gotten in any like crazy extreme
fights I mean our fights are over really
really stupid things I mean we're
together every single day so you're
bound to fight over some basically the
difference between boy and girl is what
we fight over like what a guy thinks
would have been fighting some situations
stuff like that stuff that's easily
fixable which is a blessing but I'm a
very very several person and I think one
of the reasons we work so well like we
are basically the same person in my
opinion but we also have differences so
when we're fighting I'll usually just
storm away upstairs or whatever and
within ten minutes he'll come upstairs
and he'll always be like be like I don't
want to fight with you I don't know what
happened but I love you and let's talk
about it and like rub my back and I know
you come to Rosa yes I feel like I would
need someone like this because I know
there's definitely guys out there who
are just as stubborn and will either
like walk out the door or do something
like that like he would never walk out
the door like he would never leave like
he hates fighting and he would do
anything to make sure that like we can
just end it but I mean fights are
inevitable other things throughout the
day it could be pissing us off and we
take it out on each other but it's not
that we take out each other on purpose
it's just like you know you're in the
eat of the moment things are said
something some things happen and you
know you get through it and like I said
you know everybody makes mistakes
nobody's perfect that's the thing in
your relationship things are gonna
happen you're gonna get into fights and
it's just all about how you fix it so
you've avoided the next time Isis yeah
Isis she go what are some things you
guys do to keep your relationship up in
hopin happen so yeah um flowers oh yeah
dinner dates
the little thing little notes Lilla oh
my god post nods little text messages
little little pictures sent little cards
you know be creative you know like
there's things that I would do that I
just like to shoot at the top of my head
just cause like I'm thinking about
something you know I mean up that go I'm
going to do is for her it's make your
smile really quick
you shouldn't have to shower your
girlfriend or your boyfriend with gifts
you know material things and I know that
sounds like I said cliche before
everything sounds cliche but when it's
real it's not cliche because it's only
cliche to the people that don't believe
it
see girls he gets it like how people are
way we're so simple we want we want
flowers we want hugs and kisses we want
we want to just be reminded that we're
loved and this man does not ever let me
forget it and that's chocolate is
chocolate if your girl's mother saw a
cat chocolate no chocolate quick chuckle
shuffle Dada get chocolate and then rent
the movie shut up how were you able to
fart around each other why do people
always want to know about farting I
don't understand like I will never far
in front of him that's disgust I'm sorry
times I fart around her yet you have
yeah I'm just good at making it not
sound like it's loud I don't know that's
like the one thing I will probably never
be comfortable with marry Campo wants to
know um
tell three things you don't like on each
other
oh I don't all right without about each
other on each other like I don't know
like three outfits I don't like on her
yeah things like I don't like about now
you yeah well there's nothing I don't
like about her you know what I mean but
there's three things like there's three
things I could get her to fix one would
be picking her eyebrows after I lost I'm
sorry she picks her eyelashes mascara
off and like it's just like a bad habit
like biting your nails I'm like that
just she's need to stop then the next
thing is she needs just to be a little
bit more I guess organized with her
stuff just kidding there's so much stuff
everywhere I don't know shoot it's not
that she's not organized as that or
she's not going order or anything it's
just like I like to keep everything tidy
like I enjoy cooking I enjoy cleaning
the kitchen and keeping things like
fresh this girl not so much the same you
know it's two things will sue two things
about each other okay so I don't even
want to hear anything
the third thing would be just just babe
just put your bottle caps on the water
three things I don't like about things
that honest she's like about me I'm
excited for this
I mean you pull those how really quickly
well those are three things that have
that have always been a bottom capsized
ever right all right let me think three
things I do not like about you oh can I
count that as one okay he doesn't he
refuses to cut his hair I cut my own
hair now
no he wants me to cut it but I don't
really feel comfortable cutting it
because he has a mop on his head and
it's so thick and it looks fine with the
gel in it oh I wonder my birthday you
need a haircut
time right time I think the bear with
longer I like the one contest but you
just need a little time Jen I think she
well um what else do I not like about
you he rambles a lot my uncle had like a
little name my parents in it but like
you know those little names bah bah bah
mix relationship them so rambling Ronald

I'll ramble less in my next video Fran
yeah last question because my little
question like wait too long I'm gonna
have to cut it ready but Amy wants no
both of us Brett what do you appreciate
the most about Carly and Carly with you
appreciate the most about Brett thinking
me appreciate most about Carly is how
independent she is and how hard of a
worker she is in our work like in her
work ethic is just canny unlike anything
I've ever seen really and makes me proud
to be able to share my life with
somebody like that because it rubs off
and not that I'm a lazy person but I
think everybody has a little bit of it
in them and she's really got me to do a
lot of things that I never thought I
could that is something that I will
cherish forever you know as long as
we're together
to be from what I appreciate the most
about breads there's a lot of things I
appreciate how loving and caring and
mushy and Bubba you are because I don't
know I never really thought like I mean
I knew that some guys were like you but
I never thought I would ever find
somebody like you like you're just so
amazing and just he's a great thing that
thinks he's a chihuahua like at
nighttime he's literally intertwines
like pretzels and he's like let's go to
sleep like this when I see you and Brad
