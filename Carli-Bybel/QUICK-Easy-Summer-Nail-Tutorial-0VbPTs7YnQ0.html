today's video I'm going to show you how
I got these awesome nails remember I am
definitely not a nail pro but I will
take you guys step by step so if you
want to learn how to get these summer
inspired nails please keep watching for
this look I'm going to be using three
different colors the first one I'm using
is going to be this light pink color for
the middle finger I'm going to be using
two different colors so I'm just gonna
be applying this pink color on half of
the nail next I'm taking this darker
pink color and I'm just applying this on
my pointer finger picking up this yellow
color I'm applying this on the other
side of my middle finger you're gonna do
a double coat on each nail except for
the ring finger because I'm gonna be
drawing a design on that finger so we
don't want to put too much of the color
on one nail so next up I am doing some
flowers on my nails to achieve these
flowers I'm going to be using the I
heart nail art tool kit and that's by
Sally Hansen first I'm using this tool
to pick up the hot pink color and I'm
going to be drawing on little dots that
are gonna create a flower and then I'm
also picking up the yellow color to
create a flower as well next up I'm
using also the eye heart and nail art
pen and this one is in the white color
I'm going to be using this for the
center of the flowers
then I'm taking the same pen and I'm
gonna draw some polka dots onto my
pointer finger next up I'm using a clear
coat on all of my nails except for the
polka dot nail for the Polka Dot nail
I'm gonna be using my big matte topcoat
by Sally Hansen as well and it's gonna
give it a really nice matte finish so
now I'm all finished with my first hand
and I'm gonna go do my second hand so
this is the final result all of the
products that I use in this video can be
found at Target I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and if you guys do recreate
this look make sure the hash tag my name
so I could check it out until next time
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
