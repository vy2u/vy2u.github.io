I never can forget
dreaming
and
I'm dreaming
hi everyone thank you for watching so a
lot of you have been requesting a simple
easy quick makeup look that you can do
either for school or something everyday
this look is something that I do almost
every single day I mean if I have an
extra time and I want to do extra makeup
of course I will but if I'm in a rush
this takes me anywhere from 10 to 15
minutes maximum and it just kind of
pulls yourself all together so if you
want to learn what my quick daily
routine is please keep watching and I'll
show you how the prime my face I'm using
Smashbox photo-finish
color corrector and I'm just going to be
applying this with my Mac foundation
brush
next I'm going to be applying my
favourite foundation which is L'Oreal
True Match and I'm going to be using
this same foundation brush I'm only
going to be applying this to the bottom
parts of my face and also around my
forehead and then I'm going to be using
a lighter color around the center part
of my face
next I'm using by Mac the prep and prime
and it's called light boost and I'm
going to be using this right underneath
my eyes also on my nose on my chin and
also in between my eyebrows and this is
just going to be used as my highlighter
one thing you're gonna want to do is
fill in your brows after you apply your
foundation because the lighter color is
gonna make your eyebrows appear lighter
so I'm using by whitening lightening the
brow bar in the darker brown color and
I'm just going to be using a small
angled brush and applying this right
over my eyebrows
take my back button brush in that same
dark brown color I'm going to be
applying this right onto my cheekbones
as well
for a quick contoured look I'll just
pinch my brush and just dip it in the
darker brown color and put it right on
the sides of my nose
I always switch up on blushes but for
today I'm going to be using gleeful by
Mac and I'm just going to be applying
this right on my cheekbones
one thing I always mentioned my videos
that I oh it's use for eyeshadow is by
Mac it's a mineralized skinfinish and
it's called soft and gentle and I just
apply this right in my tear duct and
also all over my eyelid
whenever I'm in a rush as I had stated
in a previous video I just grabbed my
brow bar and I used a lighter brown
color and I just apply this with a
blending brush right into the crease of
my eye
if I'm gonna rush I'll just grab my
Jordana cosmetics eyeliner pen it's
basically like a marker for your eye and
you can just really quickly draw a line
from the inner part of your eyes and
I'll just extend it a little bit out on
the outer part of my eyes as well
I don't even think I need to mention
what type of mascara I'm using because
it's always the same but for lip liner
I'm using by Jordana cosmetics as usual
the tawny color which is a very neutral
color and I'm just going to be outlining
the outside of my lips one thing I
always do as well is drag the line
inwards just so it blends in with your
natural lip line and it makes it look
more natural
for lipstick some mixing Mac myth and
also Revlon crystal cut coral is just
going to give you a nice natural color I
don't like using just nude lipstick so
it's going to give you more of a peachy
natural color
you
sometimes I'll also add this soft and
gentle Mack shimmer color to my Cupid's
bow which is right above my lips and
also right above my cheekbones if you
watch my 2012 favorites video you saw me
mention model in a bottle it's basically
hairspray for your face I love it and
that's what I'm applying right now and
you just gotta wait till it dries and
then that's basically it that's all I do
on a normal day
I mean of course there's days I wear
more makeup or there's things I wear
less but this is just a quick easy way I
would normally do my makeup so I hope
you enjoyed and learn something new and
I hope you all have a great weekend I'll
talk today but I can't recall her face
she's even far away in midnight laughter
haunts my dreams</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
