my room welcome this quote right here I
put on myself as a sticker it says if
you are confident you are beautiful this
I also made on my wall there are some
flowers and a closest s always kiss me
goodnight
I just have some nice quotes up here and
course penguins are up here as well and
this one is like my favorite any given
moment can change your life you just
have to be there
you guys remember I had my first ever
vanity right here my mom actually bought
it for me before every single person and
their mother had the Hollywood vanities
right on this roof right here I would
open my window and then love the screen
stop the screen is still sitting here
let me my friends you just open this and
we would just sit right on that roof at
nighttime and that was where I decided
to start my youtube channel just sitting
right there almost six years ago August
25th I believe was the first time I ever
posted a video on my youtube channel and
it was from this room so my mom closed
on her new house today I bought her a
new house and it's beautiful it's in a
55 and older development so she can kind
of get out of here and go a little bit
more north towards the family and
everybody else it's so crazy being here
especially knowing that this is going to
be the last time I'll ever be here to be
honest once I moved out I really only
came back for family holidays and
obviously just to spend time with my mom
but just being in this room it's been a
long time one of the last times that I
was in this room was probably one of the
worst days of my life and every
Wednesday I'll share this story with you
guys so being in here a little bit
overwhelming but I'm also here for a
good reason because right behind this
camera is where I thought of the idea to
start my youtube channel and
I would meditate every single night with
my app that I still use to this day it's
called sleep and relax well and I swear
just from meditating and listening to
that and you know just kind of being at
a really low dark place in my life I
needed a change and I needed something
different and never in a million years
that I think that my career would take
off through YouTube or anything like
that so I just feel so unbelievably
blessed because honestly without any of
you guys I wouldn't have anything that I
have and because of all of my success
I've been able to help everybody that I
love and everyone in my family which is
something that I had only dreamed I'd
ever be able to do so honestly guys I
love you I don't know what it was that
you saw in me almost six years ago but
thank you for sticking around and thank
you for still enjoying my videos and
just making me feel very loved every
single day like you guys don't even know
some of the things that I went through
and all of your comments and your love
and everything just has gotten me
through everything and I really really
truly mean that so I love you guys so
much and I'm going to rap crying no and
I'm going to go curl my hair with a
straightener wish me luck when it looks
comfy honey show anyone how you look
just like mr. bail but you guys Musha
Musha fee and we have Olly back here
he's usually so scared about everybody
Hey so I'm back and I'm ready to crown
my hair I don't remember the last time
that I called my hair of the
straightener and may have been this
video six years ago probably not because
I know I used to do it a lot but I have
not done it in so long and I used to
wear extensions all the time so I
haven't actually has really long hair
and tried this technique out so I'm
actually excited so I ripped apart
mine's higher when I'm saying my entire
I mean my entire house my entire closet
trying to find the exact shirt that I
wore when I felt my first video because
I've seen it about four or five times
since we moved because I have these
shirts in literally every color and I
got them so long ago but I wear
to bed almost every single night so I
just kept them and you should have seen
my closet I think I showed it on
snapchat but when he is trying to get
into my bag I searched and searched and
searched and no luck so I wore the
closest one possible when I'm telling
you I have this shirt and probably like
15 colors I'm not kidding I found every
single color but the one I am going to
spin the straightener and like grab the
other piece of hair so as I'm dragging
it down I'm just kind of like spinning
it what's funny is in my first video I
didn't even talk didn't work didn't work
why did it work
I remember if I kept spinning okay that
worked hey boom it was not that guys
that was no booty so I just left Best
Buy got a tripod since I forgot that and
got a new lens well I got to buy a whole
new camera so I'm going to try this
again
luckily Best Buy had to in stock online
they said they had none in stock so I
called anyway just to check and thank
God they did so it was like about 15
minutes away so I just ran there and
we're going to do this again
like the key is just to do it slow
yes there we go and we got a car a human
that happened what are the chances it
was because Winnie was up behind the
camera and he knocked the camera over up
there that I have holding my light up
and then I had cool my suction cup mount
like attached to this old Formica
dresser set that I have so I was really
trying to make do with what I had and I
ended up breaking my camera so so now
we're going to move on to the other side
we're going to repeat
it's so crazy because usually Olli hides
and he's kind of scared of me hi duty oh
I need present learn Spanish hi
sushi Dushi like it touch she's bugging
out defuse Dale okay so we're going to
go down to the next section I'll
probably show you guys like two sections
and then the front sections because you
guys don't need to seem to do this whole
thing I am going somewhere over the
weekend for something I can't tell you
about yet something I'm working on you
guys wish you can see this look at him
this is a nice bushy I'm trying to work
here
Oh literally I have never been able to
pet this cat in my entire time knowing
him this is like insane can you show
everyone your face with this fish look
at your fish so I'm trying to think what
year we moved into this apartment or
townhouse whatever I believe I was 19
maybe 20 I grew up 25 minutes from here
and my parents got divorced so we sold
our house and we first moved to like a
little town house we weren't even there
a year and then we ended up over here
and my mom's lived here ever since
funny because when I moved out on my own
for the first time I literally lived on
the same street like right around the
block so it was nice because I never
lived on my own like I never went away
to college and I never got to really
experience being on my own so although I
was technically on my own I still knew
the area I was familiar with the area
and I needed anything like my mom was
like right around the corner which was
nice I remember just II was so excited
and having to pack up this room
nightmare my mom definitely still has
pictures for like blackmail on her phone
notes what my room looks like not all
the time but some of the times you guys
don't even want to see it
she's evil she always pulled it up and
she's always like look what her room
looked like so I just thought it was
funny when I had posted the picture the
other day of me in a hotel room in LA
and I had like a nice outfit on and
there was like two dolls on the floor
the bed was unmade it was nothing crazy
I mean in my opinion and so many people
were like bugging out saying like they
couldn't believe the room was dirty and
I'm just like first of all we were in a
hotel we were rushing out the door I
barely even had time for selfie I took
like three and luckily one actually it
came out decent so sometimes you just
don't have time to clean you know I'm
like the messiest person alive but I'm
also like the cleanest person I have
like my days where I'm just like a slob
but then I always spend like a full day
like making sure everything's clean and
spotless and organized so a little bit
of all so I'm going to part it I'm going
to do it like in the middle because I
always end up like flipping it one way
or the other and I don't really know I
got to kind of see how it looks and then
decide so you know it's actually really
funny when I was in high school or now
just out of high school I was I think my
freshman year of college we were
actually in the last apartment and for
this one I have films like I think one
or two random tutorials and I had like a
different YouTube channel I don't even
remember it and I came and signed it I
wish more than anything I could find
those videos and find that channel but I
honestly can't I don't even remember
which screen name that it was with but
so those were technically my first ever
videos that no one even knows about
because it was on a completely different
channel and it was like two years prior
to me actually starting my channel so
when I grew up I was obsessed with like
filming and photography my mom actually
went to college for photography so I'm
sure that's where I get it from but when
I was in fifth grade sixth or sixth
grade she
got me my first ever video camera that
was like my own I had used hers a bunch
me and all my friends like instead of
doing anything everyone would come to my
house and we would just like film videos
and like do stupid things and just film
ourselves doing those things so many
people are always like so how's it feel
to have all these people like subscribe
to you and all that and honestly it's
crazy like it's mind-blowing I feel like
it still hasn't even hit me because yes
although we're at like five-and-a-half
million subscribers I'm here on YouTube
which is just nuts I don't get to see a
lot of you guys so of course when I'm
out and I get to meet some of you like
it's amazing and it's so much fun I love
getting to the put a face to the numbers
because yes a number is amazing but when
I actually get to like squeeze you and
talk to you and interact with you
one-on-one asks when it really sinks in
like wow like I've made friends all
around the world just by sitting in my
bedroom and talking about nonsense that
I would talk about with my friends I
feel like it'll never really hit me I
don't know I'm just like so content
being home and like being with my cats
and just kind of leaving a normal
regular life I love being like in the
middle of nowhere I was like a nice yard
and like deer in my yard and I'm super
quiet and that's just how I've always
been it's so funny because sitting here
knowing my mom's downstairs I feel like
this is my first ever video like I'm so
weird I love to be alone when I'm
filming I don't know why yeah there's
always like in one room that's like way
colder than all the others well that was
my room growing up and then this room
that I'm in right now was the cold room
in this house she's always hot and she
always has the air on even in the
wintertime and I remember waking up one
day and not even joking I was able to
see my breath and I was like alright
this has got to end it's time to move
out a couple months later moved out and
then from here we moved to our last
townhouse and then we bought a house and
I love my house like absolutely my dream
house and I turned it into like
completely mine and I'm obsessed it's
just so far from everybody like from my
family so the only thing I wish is that
I could pick it up and move it closer
but
who knows yeah you're fine come say hi
Mama's in the house Hey hi mama
Hey do you remember when I was about to
tell my first ever video or you like was
right I used to make sure nobody was
around yeah because if we heard you
talking I'm still the same in back well
you are you told me how to come home
today gosh I remember just started out
is just teaching your friend how to do
makeup and hair and here we have four
years later 6 6 August 6th year August
25th is going to be 6 years or I wish it
was born I mean I was stood saying hello
that I have been 24 such as post move
today you look gorgeous gorgeous quick
in I don't feel very gorgeous and feel
very tired but successful day I'm real
proud of this girl Oh mom we're going to
get in this room this room good and
really bad bad yeah but I told them
remember my first ever vanity not that I
know you bought it for me
what about your big makeup case did the
one that was the size of me I love it we
all have it was the one and it had a
sprinter reference and this is my makeup
case it's all packs because I have been
a little bit busy lately so I just keep
it on here and they're all my brushes
yeah I still have that up crazy
alright I'm saying goodbye because I
really need a shower have a good time
and the elated mama enjoy love you love
you let me more all right I'm going to
just take a brush and I want to brush
the hair and I feel like because my hair
is so long it's not as curly as it looks
I guess in my first video but again I
have to brush it because it's gonna look
better
so this is the final result I guess it's
pretty curly right I don't know how I
should part it whenever I wear my hair
curly as of lately I always just kind of
like toss it over and that's only
because the way I curl it it doesn't
look good any other way let's see if I
can kind of part it normally so this is
it something to use a little bit of
hairspray why not I usually don't use
too too much this is the dry bar Texas
tea oh this is the final result
hopefully whoever ends up here loves it
here and can make some new memories in
this house so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching thank you for sticking by me
through everything and for the people
that have been there since day one I owe
everything to you and I wish I could
squeeze you right through the camera
right now talking to you guys all the
time and getting to interact has just
been a constant in my life and I'm so
unbelievably grateful and I hope to
continue making videos for you guys for
as long as you want to see them and yeah
I don't know what else to say I I'm just
trying to take it all in but I can't
believe it's almost six years and since
I'm getting old and that means I'm
turning 20 ever did a couple parts
craziness I swear when people ask how
old I am I feel like think about it
because I swear I feel like I'm like 17
still I mean not quite but you know I
feel like young at heart and that's all
that matters thank you guys so much for
watching I love you so much and until
next time I'll see you guys later
