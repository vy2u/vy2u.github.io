today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this reverse smokey eye I
originally saw a similar look on makeup
on Mario's Instagram page and I thought
it was really beautiful and I want to
try it out for myself
I personally love a really thick
dramatic smokey lower lash line I
usually always do it when I'm doing my
makeup how I normally do so you guys
want to see how I got this look then
please keep watching for eyeliner today
I'm using the new em cosmetics black
eyeliner I'm going to be lining my lower
lash line and you want to use an
eyeliner like this at first because it's
going to help keep the black eye shadow
super black and help keep it in place
you want to make sure your pencil is
sharp after I did my other eye it got
pretty dull so just sharpened it really
quick next I'm using the saharan palette
by Julia's place I have a new coupon
code for you guys for 10% off I will
list it below and I am picking up the
black shade with first a eyeliner brush
to just kind of go over it a little bit
and then I'm going to go in with my
pencil brush and I'm going to start
smudging it downwards so you want to do
a little bit at a time especially when
you're using a color like black that way
you can look in the mirror as you go and
see how intense and how sick you want
that bottom line to be so just keep
smudging and don't worry if the line
isn't perfect yet as long as the
placement is right I'll show you how
we're going to clean it up next I'm
grabbing this lighter brown shade and
I'm blending in with a large blending
brush right into my crease and this is
going to help open up my eyes a little
bit I'm then grabbing this hot orange
shade and I'm putting that in my crease
as well or eyeliner I'm using this one
by Charlotte Tilbury
and I am going to be lining my upper
lash line and then here you can see I
just sharpened the wing with this type
of brush it's a lot easier to get a
sharp line and I would recommend doing
it with something like this as opposed
to just a shadow with the eyeliner brush
it'll just look a little bit neater if
you guys do decide to do your eyeliner
first before you do your face makeup you
can be a little bit more messy with it
and then wipe it off as you go for
lashes I'm using one of my favorites
which are the Samantha lashes by huda
beauty and I'm going back in
with my black eyeliner and I'm lining my
lower lash line you want to make sure
there's no gap between your inner lash
line and your lower lash line sometimes
you can see like a space between your
lashes so just keep filling it in until
it's super black I'm taking a smaller
blending brush with the same to brown
and orange colors and I'm just going to
accentuate it a little bit more and then
I'm applying a little bit of translucent
powder under my eyes that way I can do
my bottom mascara before I go in on this
eye I'm just going to smudge it a little
bit more and just sharpen the edges that
way I know it's perfect and I can put my
mascara on and be done with it so this
look looks pretty easy and pretty quick
so I'm just going to apply my bottom
lashes and then moving on to the rest of
my face I'm just dusting away all of the
excess powder and I'm going in with my
shade and light palette my Kat Von D and
I'm just going to be blending this in I
actually couldn't find this brush for so
long I found it in one of my purses and
I really missed it it's so soft and I
love how it applies the bronzer for lips
I'm going in with colour-pop Chi it's
like my all-time favorite especially for
a nude look and I wasn't sure whether I
was going to do Anasazi 'or color pop
but I'm going in with this color pop
satin lip and I'm just going to apply it
on my lips I wanted to do in nude lips
today because the eyes were super
dramatic so I wanted it to be the focus
of this look and for blush I'm using my
favorite BH pen color blush palette it's
the nude blush palette and the top right
shade is literally my favorite blush of
all time so I'm just applying that on my
cheeks and then to highlight under my
brow and picking up this gold highlight
shade from my palette highlighting on my
eyes as well as my nose and I'm going to
take a little bit with my finger and
apply it right on my Cupid's bow as well
and to finish off the look I'm using the
cover FX matte setting spray and I'm
just going to let that dry and this is
how you get a reverse smokey eye so if
you guys try it out let me know what you
think I personally love it I got a lot
of compliments at dinner last night as
well
I hope you guys enjoyed today's look I
really loved how it turned out and it
makes my eyes look a lot bigger and more
sultry so yeah I hope you guys enjoy
thank you so much for watching and
next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
