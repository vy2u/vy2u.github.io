it has been way too long since I have
done a video for my color series and I
was going through a lot of your
suggestions and I saw a lot of people
requesting that I started back up again
and that you want me to do the color red
so I figured since my nails are bright
red right now let me do all of my bright
red favorites as well as show you guys
how i got this makeup look right here
whenever i like to do a darker lip or a
red lip i like to keep my eyes somewhat
neutral so I didn't do anything crazy
with the eyes but I really love how this
makeup look came out so if you guys want
to hear some of my favorite red products
as well as learn how to get this makeup
look please keep watching to start off
this look I'm using the single shadow in
the color peach sorbet
and this is going all over my eyelid
also underneath my brow next was a large
blending brush I'm picking up this
cranberry color and I'm applying that
right into the crease of my eye I wanted
to incorporate some sort of red for this
look since it is the red color series so
I decided to use a primary color at my
crease
I have done a full primary eye before
but this whole video was about bright
vibrant red not cranberry so I figured
you just don't operate it a little bit I
feel like whenever I do red lips I
always go with the classic winged
eyeliner so I'm just applying that right
now feel free to do it however you like
I always like extending the tail extra
because it makes my eyes look a lot
bigger for lashes I'm using the wispy
sweet-nothings by velour
with my pencil brush in that same
cranberry color that I used in my crease
I'm applying that all over my lower lash
line and the next comes mascara as usual
I only use one mascara I feel like I'll
never switch over you can't find a
better mascara than this one so L'Oreal
telescopic like I should be a
spokesperson for this mascara next I'm
lining my lips with this la girl lip
liner to be honest it was the first time
that I used it and I didn't really like
the shade of it so I ends up going over
it with a different liner in a bit but I
also didn't include this liner in the
next section which you guys will see so
disregard the liner I don't really
approve of it and then for the liquid
lipstick I'm using this one by
anastasiya in the color
I think it's American doll yes American
doll and this is the most perfect red
it's literally gorgeous and I love how
it dries matte to bronze up my face a
little bit I'm using global globe I'm
Mac and this is a mineralized skinfinish
it has like a shimmer to it so it's
really really pretty I think I mentioned
this in my last video I definitely
recommend it if you guys have a lighter
skin tone as a bronzer and then since I
am looking a little pale I want to
bronze up my face with the new girl on
spray that I also mentioned in my last
video it's amazing you guys have to get
it and for blush I'm using this one by
color pop I'm not sure of the name I'll
write it below for you guys
so first we're going to start off with
lips the first product that I wanted to
mention that is my favorite at the
moment and that I'm wearing right now is
the anastacio liquid lipstick in
American doll and this is the perfect
bright red color normally with lipsticks
I'm always mixing them together because
I never really not that I don't have a
couple favorites just as is but I always
like to mix say a different lip liner
and then kind of blend it in with the
lipstick to give it a different color
this red right here is the most perfect
red and it's so bright and I think it
would look really good on a bunch of
different skin tones so what I love
about these are they go on liquid and
then they dry matte so if you guys are
in the market for a beautiful matte red
lipstick this is definitely my number
one favorite at the moment next up I
have my second favorite this one what's
the one that I was using all the time
when I would do a red lip before the
liquid lipsticks came out this one is by
Gerard cosmetics and it's a matte red
shade as well this one's called
fire-engine and it's such a gorgeous
color again it is matte so it's not
going to be I feel like as matte as the
liquid lipsticks but it's going to give
you that matte finish which is great
this color or basically all the
lipsticks from their line are so
pigmented that's why I'm obsessed with
them so if you guys are in the market
for a great red lipstick that's not too
drying it's gonna keep your lips
moisturize but also matte at the same
time this lipstick you definitely need
in your life
it's probably a tie between my top
favorites between the Anasazi and the
drawer they're just such great red
colors and I've looked on Instagram and
I've seen so many people wearing these
and I've seen all different skin tones
all different ethnicities and I think
it's just a universal read that looks
great on everybody that's another thing
that people some people have problems
with finding like a warmer red or a
cooler red and of course it all just
depends on preference what you think
looks best on you I don't have a
preference I'll go for warm colors I'll
go for cool colors it just kind of
depends on the shirt that I'm wearing
the outfit I'm wearing or what I want to
kind of match it with so those are
definitely my top two I have two
drugstore lipsticks that I love the one
by covergirl and hot passion this one I
used to use all the time it's such a
beautiful red but it's really pigmented
and
goes on really nice and it's going to
give you that nice creamy consistency
the other one is by NYX and it's the
butter lipstick in the color big cherry
and it's also a really gorgeous shade
the NYX lipsticks I'm obsessed with they
are super affordable but yet they're so
pigmented I know I've been saying that
about basically every single one but the
next ones are just so affordable and
sometimes when you buy cheaper lipsticks
they can come out really sheer and it's
really disappointing so for some of you
guys that maybe want to order some of
these online without trying them first
these ones I definitely back up a
hundred percent and for those two
lipsticks those are both again a creamy
finish they're not going to give you
that matte look so I guess it's really
all about preference what you guys are
looking for the next lipstick is by Mac
and this was the Viva Glam Rihanna I
really wasn't going to include it in
this video because I don't think it's
even available anymore
you may be able to find it on Amazon I
will definitely check and if I find it
anywhere I'll link it for you guys this
almost has like not a shimmer to it but
it has just like it glistens like when
you put light on it you could see how
beautiful it is I'm going to swatch
everything you can see really the
difference in the shades so if you're
looking for that perfect read you can
see all of them side by side and then go
for whatever texture and consistency
that you want best for you whatever
you're looking for so that one's amazing
I also have one more by Kat Von D it's
different than the other ones that I
mentioned because it has like a gold
shiny reflection in it it's more of like
a like a hot red I don't know it's kind
of hard to explain but once you see it
it's more like an orange you read but
like with shimmery texture so you'll see
it compared to the other one I have two
lip glosses that I also wanted to
mention the first one is by anastacio
and it's in the color runway red a lot
of their glosses have like sparkle to it
but it's not like so sparkly that when
you put it on it looks like sparkles it
just gives it like a beautiful
glistening look and I love them because
they're not sticky I only will use a lip
gloss if it's not sticky so these two
are really my favorites they're really
really pigmented you don't need to wear
anything under it but yet they're not
sticky which is a huge thing so the
other lip gloss is by gerard cosmetics
as well and it's called candy apple
these two glosses are going to give you
that shiny glossy
finish so I've lately been kind of
staying away from the glosses I use them
here and again but I feel like they make
my lips look a little bit too big with
the gloss that's kind of why I've been
sticking with the more matte lipsticks
but
next I have a few lip liners the one
that I love the most and that I think is
worth every penny is the color red has
two DS by Mac and I actually have like a
lip liner holder I'll show you really
quick and the cap is stuck in it this is
this little lip liner holder um it holds
all the MAC lipsticks and the cap is
stuck in there so I just really quickly
wanted to mention it this is what I use
to line my lips along with the Anastacio
liquid lipstick I was first using this
la girl won but it just is way too sheer
not sheer but it's more like a pinkish
red and that's just not what I was going
for today so I'm not even going to
include that in this section another lip
liner that's great this one's a little
bit lighter of a red it's more of like a
red orange this one is my makeup forever
in the color 25c so again this one is a
little bit more on the orangie side but
I will swatch them next to each other so
you could see what red your going for
and then you can choose that way and the
last one is by Milani and this one is
called cherry pie this one's really
affordable and I think this is like the
closest to the Mac one that I have it
glides on really nice which is always
good and it's affordable so if any of
you guys are looking for a beautiful red
color I feel like I've given you a lot
of options all price ranges so it just
really depends on your budget and of
course the color you're looking for but
those are definitely my top out of all
of the ones that I have
I have two different nail polishes that
I wanted to show you I got my nails done
while I was out in LA and it's like this
red gel manicure so I don't know the
color of it they just had like a whole
sheet of different colors but I found
basically the same color and I even
tested it on top of it to see and it's
literally the same color in OPI it's
called hey veto is my car ready and I
don't know I haven't worn red on my
nails in so long and I just really love
how it looks I think it's perfect for
the springtime since it's so bright it's
not like that dull red that um is great
for like fall in winter so this color is
almost the exact dupe to the color that
I'm wearing on my nails and then I have
one more red shade that is gorgeous as
well it's by butter LONDON and this one
is called her majesty's red and it's
again very very similar it's a bright
radiant red which is what we're going
for for this look I have so many
favourites of like deep reds like
Burgundy's like stuff like that but I
figured if I added all of that into this
one video it would just be way too much
so I just wanted to try and keep it
simple as possible next I have my Mac
they're called reflex rust and it's like
red shimmery sparkles and it's the loose
pigments by Mac I'm obsessed with the
Mac pigments and the number one reason
for that is because I've had some of
them for so long and they just never run
out it's like you can use it every
single day and you'll probably have it
forever that's how much pigment is
actually in it so these are gorgeous I
find it very hard to work with bright
red shadows for your eyes what I think
this would look cool as maybe if I
wanted to do something a little more
dramatic with this look
maybe apply this with something wet
first and then apply it over that dark
reddish color that I have underneath my
eyes I think that would be really cool
but again it's very dramatic we're not
going to be wearing red on our eyes
every single day it's something that's
for either a special occasion or just a
night out or something like that
next I have
i carly lashed by the lower lashes for
valentine's day that came in these red
cases so i figured how can I not mention
it in this video I know you guys have
probably seen these a million times but
they are the lash that I designed with
velour lashes and they're super wispy
they're so gorgeous I love them and why
I love them so much as you can really
wear them for a daytime look or you can
dress them up and have like this super
super glam look so that's what's cool
about them I have a video which I will
link right here if any of you guys want
to see a how to apply lashes
step-by-step because I've seen some
people requesting it but I have that
video out for you guys so again I'll
link it for you over here and then I
also explain everything about the lash
how to cut it how to apply it how to
maintain it how to get 25 uses out of
them so I figured I would include that
today because as I was looking for red
products besides the lip products I
don't have many favorites and I don't
want to just throw in a million products
just to confuse all of you so I wanted
to keep it to my top top favorites this
time around I think in some of my other
color series I'm a went a little
overboard which even this is maybe even
a little overboard for some people but
let's continue I have two more products
the first one is by Smashbox
it's the CC cream and I'm including this
because it had the red lettering on it
but the Smashbox CC cream and BB creams
are my hands-down favorite out of any of
the other ones that I tried the CC cream
I would recommend for adults or for
people with aging skin um I use the CC
cream which I'm 24 so I mean I think
it's good to start young but the BB
cream I would recommend it for my girls
out there in high school or college even
or just anyone who needs something very
lightweight that's going to give you
great coverage so of course I wanted to
mention these they are a little bit
pricey but I have tried so many
different BB creams and it's not that I
didn't like every other one I just found
that the coverage was the best for these
and yeah so it's great because there's
so many different benefits in one it
Prime's perfects protects hydrates and
controls oil all in one so you don't
need a primer you don't
to have a bunch of gunk on your face
especially with the warm weather coming
up and the last product that I have for
you guys today is by Revlon and this is
the wrinkle remedy line filler and I
have a couple different line fillers
this one and then there's a NARS one
that I love the best all you do is well
what I do is after I prime my face I use
um this filler like right on my laugh
lines and then sometimes which I haven't
done it recently but sometimes I'll
apply it like on my little wrinkles on
the sides of my eye so these are really
cool it's basically the same idea as the
pore minimizing primer it's just going
to kind of blur it out and just fill in
the wrinkle so to say it a little bit so
I use this a bunch and I really loved it
so I wanted to include that as well one
more thing really quick that I almost
forgot to mention it's not a makeup
product but I have this on my dresser
and I always go through these and they
have the most amazing quotes in it but
I'd actually bought this for me it's
called think happy be happy and it's
just all different art pictures and
different quotes and everything like
that so I think it's so cool I have one
from Nicole goro as well she got me one
and I think it's just really nice to get
a book of quotes that way if you're ever
having a bad day or if you ever just
need a little pick-me-up you can just
open it up and read a few and it's just
really nice to read quotes I'm obsessed
with quotes I'm sure you guys know that
by now and yeah so I think they really
can change your life and I don't know
where he got this I'm pretty sure
Francesca's but I'm sure they have
millions of them all over the place so
get a book of quotes and start reading
them and write down your favorite ones
and yeah that's just a little tip that I
have for you guys so that is basically
it as far as my favorite red products I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I'm
sorry it's been so long since I've done
a color series I wasn't really sure how
well you guys were liking them but then
seeing how many people requested a new
one figured you know what it's time to
do it and my nails are bright red and I
saw so many requests for red so it just
made sense I love you guys so much I
hope you enjoyed this video and until
next time I'll see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
