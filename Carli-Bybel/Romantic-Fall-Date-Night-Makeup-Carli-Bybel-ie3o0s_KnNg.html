today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here I
wanted to do something like rose gold
and super shimmering it's kind of
romantic in a way I think it's a perfect
date night look and it's also perfect
for fall so if you guys want to see how
I got this look right here please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
using the trish mcevoy eyeshadow and
eyeliner as a primer in the color rose
quartz and it's a really pretty rose
gold shade I'm applying it directly on
my eye and then I'm using a brush to
blend it in next up I'm using this new
Charlotte Tilbury legendary and Muse
palette I just recently picked this one
up from Nordstrom and I'm picking up the
lighter rose gold color and I'm applying
that on the inner half of my eye then
I'm grabbing the darker rose color and
I'm applying that on the outer half
with a large blending brush I'm picking
up this yellow gold color and I'm
applying that in my crease
next I'm picking up another
limited-edition palette it's by Sean
Takei and it's the protecta Lions Eye
palette I also picked this one up from
Nordstrom's and the reason that I fell
in love with the palette I mean
obviously as soon as I saw the Lions I
quickly googled the brand to make sure
that it was cruelty free and it was so I
purchased it and I also realized that
they are donating five percent of all
proceeds to the lion Guardians
Foundation which helps protect lions so
it's a good cause next I'm picking up
this dark matte brown shade and I am
using a smaller blending brush and I'm
applying this in the outer V of my eye
so I first dip my brush into my setting
spray just to make the pigment a little
bit darker
and then I'm grabbing this shimmery
cranberry color and I'm lightly applying
that right above the brown and that
yellow shade just to have it kind of
fade really nicely I'm then picking up
that same matte brown shade and I'm
applying it on my lower lash line just
up until like the middle part of my eye
and then underneath that I'm applying
that same cranberry color and I'm
blending it into the brown and I'm also
blending it up into where the outer V of
my eye is then I'm just grabbing a clean
blending brush and I'm just going to
blend it out a little bit so there's no
sharp edges
I'm done picking up that light rose gold
shade and I'm applying it in my tear
duct and then that darker rose shade I
am blending from my tear duct into like
the middle part of my eye then I'm
grabbing the white shade from the Lian
palette and I'm applying that underneath
my brow and also in my tear duct just to
brighten it up a bit
four lashes I'm using the w SP lashes as
always they're just my go-to lashes at
this point and for this look I'm not
going to be using eyeliner I figured
switch it up a bit
but I'm going to be using the black
eyeliner in the lower part of my eye
moving on to my face I'm gonna be using
this NARS bronzer from this bronzer and
blush palette
you
and I'm gonna add a little bit to my
chest because my tan slowly fading so I
got a bronze myself--but
for blush I'm mixing these two it one's
more of like a rose color and one's more
of like a peachy color ones also matte
and ones shimmer so I figured let me mix
them together and then I'm gonna start
to highlight my nose with the
highlighter in this palette I wanted it
a little bit stronger so I'm going back
into that Lyons palette and I'm going
over that with the white shade
so in this video I use a lot of new
products the Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks
being one I've never tried them before
so when I was at Nordstrom I picked up
like five different colors and I really
really liked them they're a creamy matte
finish and i'm using the color bond-girl
and then i'm just lining my lips a
little bit with like a neutral liner
just because I feel like I can't wear
lipstick without lip liner and then I
wanted it to be more of like a rose gold
like shimmer so I'm using this obsessive
compulsive cosmetics lip tar in the
color Hollywood and it's gonna give it
that really pretty metallic look
and then to finish off this look I am
using a setting spray and that is how I
created this rose gold shimmery look so
this is the final result I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and until next time I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
