either ah
so if you
he tries give me time
trouble
hi everyone thank you for watching so
with Valentine's Day right around the
corner I wanted to get up another makeup
look for you guys I saw a ton of
different requests and when I was
figuring out what I wanted to do I
figured why not show a look that I tend
to do a lot actually
but that I haven't recorded so basically
whenever I do my fashion posts for my
blog I always am kind of in a rush and I
always stick to the same look so I
wanted to show you it's like a matte
dark brown smokey eye and I figured it'd
be a great look to do for Valentine's
Day
for any of you guys going out or someone
who wants a very like soft dramatic
romantic look so to say so along with
the look I'm going to be showing three
different lipstick options this one is
look number one and I tend to do a nude
lip whenever I do this kind of makeup
look but I saw a lot of you guys ask
them for a look with red lips and then
another pinkish look so definitely stay
tuned to the end of the video to see the
three different shades on my lips
because I will show you all three so if
you guys want to learn how to get this
dramatic Valentine's Day makeup look
please keep watching start off this look
I'm going to be priming my eye with my
concealer feel free to use the eyeshadow
base instead I'm applying these two
light brown colors from my BH palette
all over my lid and then picking up my
blending brush with those same two
colors I'm blending it out into my
crease next up I'm using my favorite
dark matte brown shadow this one is
called run and it's by Mac and I'm
picking up my pencil brush and I'm
coloring in the outer V of my eye
you
next I'm grabbing this smaller pencil
brush and since it has a little bit of a
pointed tip it's a lot easier to control
the movement and I'm just blending out
the work I had done mixing it into the
lighter brown shade that is already in
my crease and then I'm grabbing my
blending brush again and just blending
out all this work using that same matte
brown color I'm taking a smaller brush
and I'm lining the lower lash line with
this look you can keep adding as much as
you want I like to have everything
blended out and then I add the darker
color back into the crease so you can
continue these steps so if you want it a
little bit more dramatic feel free to
add a little bit more or if you want it
less dramatic again add a little bit
less to line my upper lash line I'm
using my favorite gel liner by pH and
the color onyx for lashes I'm using one
of my favorite pairs from the lower
lashes it's one of their newer brands
it's called girl you're crazy and I love
these lashes before I apply them I'm
going to be adding a little bit of
mascara to my natural lashes that way
they blend a lot better and I don't have
to apply so much of mascara to the
actual lashes so I noticed my Islander
looks a little bit sloppy from this
angle so I took pologize I ended up
fixing it at the end but whenever I'm
filming these videos I'm pretty far from
a mirror so it's kind of hard to tell so
again I do apologize I'm just going back
to those two steps that I had originally
told you about just adding more of the
same matte brown color just to give it
that dark shade that I want
I wanted to thank you guys for
recommending this nude liner by Rimmel
because I am using it in this video for
the first time and I really loved it and
I'm just applying that right in the
inner part of my lash line following
that I'm taking the new BH waterproof
gel liner and I'm applying a little bit
right into the inner tear-duct of my eye
you
you
so normally when I would do this kind of
look I would probably go for a nude lip
but I wanted to show you guys three
different options because I know some of
you guys wanted something with a red
lock or something nude or maybe like a
lighter pink so I'm gonna show you the
three different options that I decided
to choose for this look
so for the first look I'm using a nude
lip liner and this one is called
innocent
and the lipstick I'm using is called
flesh pot by Mac
and then over that look I'm using my
favorite nude gloss the one by whitening
lightning
and I'm going back to that BH pencil
that I'd used on my eyes and I'm going
to be highlighting my Cupid's bow so
like I said if I were to wear this look
I would probably pick this nude lip I
love doing nude lips I'm sure you guys
already know that but I wanted to show
you guys a few different suggestions in
case you wanted to recreate it and try a
different lip color before I move on to
the other lip colors I'm going to be
applying some pink blush this one is by
NARS and I'm applying it all over my
cheeks
I'm going to wipe this one off and move
on to the lip color number two I'm going
to be using tawny by Jordana
the first lipstick I'm using is called
nude creme and this one is by Milani
and then over that I'm using the revlon
colorburst matte balm and this one is in
elusive and then right over that I'm
using the same nude gloss this color is
going to give you a nice pink look for
those of you wanting to be in the
Valentine's Day spirit as I said I think
if I were to do this which I probably
will be doing this look on Valentine's
Day I will probably be sticking with the
nude look but I wanted to give you guys
options so this was option number two so
now let's move on to the third option
and I saw a lot of you guys asking for a
look that involved a red lip so this one
is for you guys to line my lips I'm
using plush plum by Jordana
and the red lipstick I'm using is by Mac
and this one is RiRi Wu and I will this
below a couple drugstore alternatives
for those of you who want to run out and
get the color because there are about
five different shades of red that I
found at the drugstore that I love so
don't worry you don't need to do Mac to
have a perfect red lip
so this is the final result for the eyes
and then of course depending on what lip
color you chose I'm sure it will look
beautiful definitely take some pictures
and make sure to hashtag me so I can
check out your looks I hope you guys
have an amazing Valentine's Day
and remember if you don't have a date
this year do not worry go out hang out
with your girlfriends go grab a movie
eat some chocolate you'll be fine and
maybe next year you'll have a Valentine
but don't get discouraged okay
I hope you guys have a great day and
until next time I'll see you guys later
so I got no magic potion all I know is
that
