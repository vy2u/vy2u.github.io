today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this Valentine's Day inspired
makeup look this one is a bit more
dramatic I would recommend if you guys
are going out to dinner or if you guys
are spending the night out I love how
this matte gray smokey eye came out and
the best part about it is you can really
mix and match with lip colors so if you
guys want to see how I got this makeup
look please keep watching first I'm
priming my eyes with this five-in-one
eye shadow primer for eyeshadow I'm
using this eye shadow palette from
Sephora it has all grey matte shadows
I'm going to be using the to graze the
black and the white for this look so
first I'm picking up the white color and
I'm applying it right in my tear duct
next I'm grabbing this light gray color
and I'm applying it right on the center
part of my lid
then grabbing is dark gray color I'm
applying that on the outer half of my
eye now I'm just grabbing something with
a flat edge like this when I first
started doing makeup videos I would do
tape just to get a nice even line and
filling in the dark gray with that color
next I'm grabbing this light gray color
with a big fluffy blending brush and I'm
blending it right into my crease picking
up a little bit of this black shadow
with a smaller blending brush I'm then
going to be applying that right on the
outer V of my eye I'm again taking
something with a flat edge just so we
have a nice perfect blended look
picking up that same white color I'm
then applying that right underneath my
brows to highlight to my my eyes I'm
using this clay liner by Tarte
you
so moving on to my face I'm applying my
NARS concealer right underneath my eyes
and I'm just going to blend that in
so next to contour and set my concealer
I'm using the new Kat Von D contour and
highlight palette I love how it has a
cool shade and some warmer shades and
then it has the different highlight
color so it's really great for any skin
tone color this one just recently came
out and I loved how pigmented it is and
if the Kat Von D shade and light palette
comes with the color slumber eyeshadow
play and subconscious so I'm going to be
using the brush that also came out with
the contour highlight kit it's a double
sided brush so that way it makes it so
much easier for you guys looking to
contour and highlight instead of using
two brushes you could use this single
one for everything whether it be in the
contour shade the highlight shade or
even your blush so what I'm first going
to do is grab this middle shade and kind
of bronze up my face a little bit I'm
going to be using the cooler shade to go
right into my contour zones because your
contours are more of a cooler shade you
want it to be more of a grey not too
much orange but if you want to bronze up
your face you can use either or I'm
going to use this middle one since I'm a
little bit on the pale side I'm going to
be using this end and I'm just taking a
little bit and I'm going to start
bronzing up my face and this is just to
prepare it before the contour because
like I said I'm a little bit pale and I
wanted to just bronze myself up a little
bit so
then using the opposite side and the
cooler tone Brown I'm going to be going
right into my contour zones
I just wiped off this end a little bit
and I'm going to be grabbing the middle
yellow shade to set my concealer
moving on to blush I'm using the color
blissful by Smashbox it's a nice purpley
color with these blushes a tiny bit goes
a long way so just start with a smaller
amount and then you can always add on
for lips I'm using my Kat Von D the
everlasting liquid lipstick in the color
Bauhaus such a beautiful color when I
was watching different colors to use for
this video this one just really stood
out to me and not to mention that I had
earrings to match but I love grey with
this bright magenta purpley color so I'm
just going to be applying this all over
my lips
and then I'm lining my lips with my
flush plum lip liner so this is the
final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I hope you guys have an
amazing Valentine's Day I know we still
have a few more days but I just wanted
to get a few looks up for you guys so
you have some options and some
inspiration for this year so I love you
guys so much and until next time I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
