hope you guys had an amazing christmas
or hanukkah for those of you guys who
celebrated sorry it's been a little bit
since I posted a video as for me I've
been relaxing maybe a little bit too
much but today I'm back in the swing of
things I wanted to record a New Year's
Eve makeup look for you guys I posted a
few in the years past and I was
struggling a little bit when I was
trying to decide what kind of look I
wanted to do this year I've done gold
glitter I've done rhinestones I've done
basically every color that you can
imagine are heading for New Year's so
this year I decided to go with something
a little bit lighter it's not too too
too bold I'm doing a nice rose gold
sparkly look when I sat down to record
look I wasn't really sure what I was
going to come up with but I was inspired
by my new ludora boutique earrings that
I actually just got in the mail
yesterday so if you guys want to learn
how i got this makeup look please keep
watching to prime my eyes I'm using my
awake eye shadow base by Sigma you're
going to want to apply this all over
your eyelids grabbing my Naked 3 palette
I'm picking up the color trick and I'm
applying that all over my eyelid
grabbing a little bit of the colored
dust I'm applying that right over it to
give it a really pretty rose gold finish
with a large blending brush I'm picking
up the color nooner and I'm applying
that right into the crease of my eye
with a smaller blending brush I'm
picking up that same color and I'm
applying that right into the crease to
give it a little bit of a darker look
next I'm grabbing this white shade I'm
not exactly sure the color I think it's
strand but I was covering it but I'm
just applying this right underneath my
brows and then I'm just grabbing my
blending brush and just blending the
crease into that white shade to give a
really pretty blended look moving on to
black gel liner I'm using the color
wicked by Sigma and I'm slowly drawing
on a line feel free to do whatever
eyeliner you prefer for your eye shape
and for lashes I'm using my new Carlie
lash I'm so obsessed with them and I'm
so obsessed with all of your pictures
it's so great to see that they look
amazing on all different eye shapes so
thank you guys so much for hashtagging
me because it literally makes my day
every time I see it and yeah so thank
you guys for the support I was a bad
girl and I forgot to put mascara on
before so I'm just applying it a little
bit just be careful not to get too much
on the lashes because if you guys saw my
previous video you probably know that
it's better to put the mascara on first
so at this point in the video I wasn't
sure if I was gonna put glitter on my
lid or not so I'm applying a little bit
of this twirl pigments just kind of
brighten up my lid I ends up adding
glitter at the end so it doesn't even
matter if you want to skip that step but
moving on to face for my primer I'm
using by Smashbox this new one it's a
pore minimizer and just want to make
sure it goes evenly all over your face
from foundation I'm using my absolute
favorite which is the Chanel perfection
Lumiere and I'm using it in the color 30
for concealer and highlighter I'm using
the pro conceal in the color creamy
beige and I'm applying it under my eyes
and also like a downward triangle on my
face I'm also applying it on my chin
down the bridge of my nose and in
between my brows and a contour i'm using
this Make Up For Ever concealer palette
in the darker shades and I'm using the
lightest color mixed with the darkest
color actually and I'm going to start
contouring my nose I'm also going to use
a small foundation brush and apply this
on my cheekbones and around my forehead
as well as along my jaw line
I'm grabbing the same foundation brush
but this one is a clean one and I'm
going to start blending in the concealer
and then I'm lightly blending in the
contour lines that I had done with the
cream concealer
to set my concealer I'm using Rimmel
stay matte powder
moving onto a powder contour I'm using
the lightest shade in my anastacio
palette and I am applying it on my
cheekbones and I'm blending it up onto
my forehead and basically everywhere
that I had just contoured with the cream
contour I'm going to go over it with a
nice powder contour
so going back to my eyes I am using that
same light pink pigment and I'm applying
it underneath my lower lash line then
over that I'm using fix+ and this copper
/ rose gold glitter also by obsessive
compulsive cosmetics and I was just
gonna originally do it on my bottom line
but it didn't seem like enough glitter
so I am applying a little bit on my lid
as well because it is New Year's and
this is the one day that you can really
get away with something super glittery
I'm then applying my mascara on my lower
lashes and I am applying a nude liner in
the inner part of my eye following that
I'm grabbing a little bit of the color
nooner with my pencil brush and I'm
applying that right on the outer half of
my lower lash line so now moving on to
blush this one's by Mac I'm not exactly
sure the name but I will list it below
for you guys and I'm just applying that
all over my cheeks to highlight I'm
using this one by Chanel I do believe it
was limited edition for the holidays but
it is so gorgeous I'm just applying it
with my fingers right on my cheekbones
for lips I'm using boldly bear by Mac to
outline them and for lipstick I'm using
by hourglass in the nude number one
and last but not least I am using the
best damn facial spray from Nicole
Guerrero's new skincare line and I'm so
excited for her I'm so proud of her
I think the facial spray was a genius
idea because I think you cannot live
without a facial spray without setting
your makeup it's just not going to last
the whole night so this is definitely
one of the most important steps so
congrats to my girl Nicole on her new
line I'm loving the new products and I
can't wait to see what other products
will be launching so this is the final
result I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you guys have an amazing
New Year's Eve and New Year's Day and I
hope you guys stick to some of the
things that you have planned for this
year because now that 2014 is over it's
a little bit more of a wake-up call to
get back on track with all the goals
that we had planned and I for one need
to get back to the gym and start working
out again because I've been slacking
this whole holiday season so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video again have a
safe and happy healthy New Year I will
be back later in the week with another
video for you guys so until then I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
