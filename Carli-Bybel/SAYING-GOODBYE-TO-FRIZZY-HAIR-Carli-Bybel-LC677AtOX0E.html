why is there a bus it is 11:30 8 p.m.
and there's a bus and I forgot wrong in
my last video on everyone thought I
lived somewhere where it was super
bright out at 11:30 p.m. it is Monday
and I'm heading up to will get a keratin
treatment so I figured I was just
filling myself getting it done because
I've never done that and I've been doing
this for a few years now so the brand of
keratin that I do is called GK keratin
and I personally restock them their
customer service just to make sure that
they were closely free company and they
did answer me and they say that they
were 100% cruelty free so my friend
Lindsey has been doing it for me for I'd
know how long it's like four years I
know I posted a picture I think like the
second time she had done it for me
when I was first getting it on I did my
entire head now I haven't done my whole
head and probably like two years I only
do the front part so like the hair
around my face is frizz free I like
having the curl to the back because
gives me more volume and
we like more texture and stuff like that
July 4th was the longest weekend
I've already started on Saturday we had
my friend's birthday and then Monday we
went to his hands she has a house like
two blocks from the beach so nice so we
went on the beach and we had dinner
there and we were with like entire
family and it was so much fun
and then sue today once my aunt's for a
barbecue at her house of July 4 and nice
is just kind of disconnect and spend
time with family just like bond was
everybody it's been a while
so that was really nice when's I mean my
friend went to a secure data facial for
her birthday Friday I supposed to get a
video up revised but he had a death in
the family so we had a week to go to on
Friday and then after the week Friday
night we went to Brett's mom event that
she had in has Barry Saturday we woke up
I woke up really early and I went down
and picked my sister up and then we went
dress shopping I had to get my maid of
honor dress and my mom was looking for a
dress so we all ended up finding a dress
awesome awesome please please wants to
do passes before the ladies over there
are so sweet so helpful and then I went
to my sisters
got a new kitty and then yesterday which
was Sunday we went over to Brett amps
house and we had a really fun full day
so we just relax a little bit of a pan
and out by the pool and yeah so my phone
was literally in the Cabana of the whole
day yeah I've been kind of disconnected
so this week I'm back we are going to LA
this weekend just for literally like two
days my good friend Haru she's turning
30 so she's having a party out there we
buy on Saturday and then we leave Monday
it's gonna be a super super quick trip
but I really did not want to miss her
birthday other than that I have no plans
besides of course my card in and make
sure I get up at least three videos for
you guys to speak I also have my volume
log that I edit which I got to editing
it up for you guys as well so yeah
ideally guys was blabbing for about ten
minutes or now so I will be getting a
little bit
just filled up I'm going to go in right
now my hundred things how are you not
too much it looks so scary right now I
was like just eyebrows and no makeup on
this is my hair and this is Daphne hello
beautiful movie star I can't get over
the puffs right here the Africa look
puff did you paint her freaking nails no
the rumor Lindsey say hi lives Lindsey
the Queen the only person I trust we mix
the two and I actually use the 10 volume
developer instead of the regular
developer you would use for color
touching as Wella collect on color touch
so did you use you mix them for my roots
are into three on your route and then I
brought those a sore foot yet the threes
a little bit darker than the for more
got brought through firends
cool so that's at all the secret key to
gear Thank You T good we could do fluffy
head like a fuzzy puffs this machine
though remember life before it sucks up
all the humility so we're using the
curly strength medium strength from GK
which will allow some of that wave but
will be completely a hundred percent for
free we didn't do this wrong one last
time and it was like we're but like we
have not a shot that the strongest
resist been straight in the past so you
put the shit all in my hair and then
when we blow dry it right and we blow
dry it and after it's a hundred percent
dried we seal it into the hair with 450
degree heat and that seals the keratin
into the hair cuticle crazy when I used
to do the Japanese straightening they
would have to apply whatever blow it all
out straighten it wash it blow it out
again
straighten it again and like I think
it's good literally 12 hours
so we just do this front section so like
I was telling you guys I like to have an
embody and we're just doing really the
front of her hair where it's like her
problem area
now she any use the straight I train
faster well I'm judging it's just so
scary like watching you get so close
like I know you're not going to burn me
but very scary
you were saying
she mystery because it really just sucks
up all of the pieces
you
hey the focus
the hair
example hi
throw with a bunch of hot coals in it
the kerosene is packagin by steeping
over each hair strand have fun of
crevices and holes in it
just paving c-care Shriners all of the
proceeds but it's making your hair super
super straight and silky
it is far rejuvenated some of the
keratin treatments are like really bad
for you right there's like formaldehyde
or all kinds of crazy stuff in it yes I
have the proper ventilation you only
have doors open with the air purifier
because a few churches so we've
definitely
proper equipment
see flow OG wrong with her
you want to come we want to call thank
you so much I will talk to you yeah
course you later got right all right bye
what's hot in here choose what just
finished up at the hair came out really
really good some about to be home in
about six or seven minutes so I will see
you guys a little bit later
what what did you see
you don't have my hand
ya know
actually let it out of my hand he wants
to bums can run anything like me no
they're not going to bite you
just be careful let's keep doing the
food I like it
