so excited to be sitting down filming
this video for you guys today
this entire look is inspired by Selina
of course and I absolutely loved how it
came out I was planning on filming this
on Monday for you guys but I couldn't
find my Bellamy bangs I had like four
pairs of them and I haven't seen them
since we moved so I was ripping apart my
house trying to find them and I couldn't
find them so I asked them to overnight
me a new pair of bangs and yesterday I
was sitting around waiting for FedEx
like not doing anything just kind of
cleaning is waiting for the FedEx and I
ran out to the post office for literally
like five minutes Brett was home so I
was like make sure you wait and if FedEx
comes I need my bangs so I can film this
video and of course the next comes
doesn't even ring the doorbell and
leaves a little slip on the door so when
I got home and I saw that I was like no
like I need my bangs so I ended up
calling FedEx we tracked down the FedEx
driver and I didn't end up finding him
and getting my bangs until around 4:30
so I was gonna film it last night but I
kind of like when it's daytime behind me
although it's a pretty gloomy day today
anyway so I figured I would wake up
today start fresh and create this makeup
hair and outfit look for you guys I
absolutely love Selena's music when I
was growing up I have seen the movie
Selena probably at least 50 times it was
definitely one of my favorites
so she was murdered at age 23 which is
just absolutely heartbreaking I'm going
to be 26 in a couple of weeks and just
the thought of myself at 23 like you're
still such a baby
so to see her do so much good and to do
so much amazing things by the age of 23
is such an inspiration to not only mean
but to so many girls out there so in
honor Selena I wanted to create this
look for you guys today
hope you enjoy and if you want to see
how I got this hair makeup and outfit
please keep watching so to start off
this look I am priming my face with my
cover effects anti blemish mattifying
primer and I am just applying that in a
downwards motion for foundation I'm
using the graftobian warm palette and I
saw some of you guys asking why my
foundation is so much darker than my
skin and it's because my body is Tanner
than my face I use a lot of exfoliator
on my face so that's why it's a little
bit lighter than my body so I just like
to match my face with my body you know
and I'm just blending all that in with a
damp Beauty Blender
moving on to eyebrows I'm first starting
off with the brow is by anastasia
beverly hills in the color evany and i'm
going to try and reshape my brows since
mine are a little bit thicker it wasn't
exactly possible to get the exact shape
but i'm gonna be going back in and
fixing these probably like five times in
this tutorial because i just wanted to
get them right I noticed that hers are a
little bit further apart so I'm starting
mine a little further apart and I'm also
rounding the edges around by my nose and
then I'm grabbing the Anastasio pomade
also in Ebony and I'm going to darken up
the eyebrows again after this first time
I go back and fix them so they're not
perfect right now but we will fix them
eventually but it always helps when you
have the picture in front of you that
way you can keep looking back and trying
to make the shape as good as possible
so next I'm applying my concealer this
one's by NARS and it's in the shade
custard and I'm just blending that in
I'm also applying it on my eyelids so
for this look I wanted to make my nose
look more like hers so I'm not going to
do my normal contouring technique I'm
going to make the bridge of my nose a
little bit wider so I'm going to put
more highlighter on the bridge
and I'm still going to use this to
contour I'm just going to be applying
the lines a lot further apart so I have
a pretty wide nose to begin with so what
I usually do for my own makeup is I like
drawing the lines closer together it
gives the appearance of more narrow nose
so here you can see by making the lines
further apart it's actually gonna make
your nose look a little bit wider so
it's really really cool what contouring
and highlighting can do and that was my
goal for this look was to try and
contour and highlight in the right ways
to help make my features look a little
bit more like Selena's so I'm just using
this little brush from artis and I'm
just blending in those sides next I'm
just blending out my little under eye
wrinkles and I'm setting my under eyes
with the Ben Nye cameo powder so I've
been planning on doing this hair makeup
outfit video for weeks and weeks now and
after I posted my photo today I received
a lot of hate and backlash for it and it
made me really upset because I loved
Selina growing up and as soon as I saw a
Mac coming out with this collection I
figured since I'm no longer using the
Mac products and I'm not going to be
able to try any of her collections that
I would recreate this look using some
cruelty free options so before all the
hate comes onto youtube I just wanted to
let you guys know that yes does he did
an amazing job she looks so much like
Selina and she killed it but I also have
this idea for weeks now and I spent a
lot of money getting all of the products
and the outfit and everything together
so I really really wanted to create it
for you guys this is just my take on it
so back to the makeup tutorial I'm
applying the lightest highlight shade
all over to set my concealer and then
I'm going in with the peachy shade and
then I'm applying that on the sides of
my nose just to diffuse the color a
little bit
moving on to eyes I'm using the new
makeup by Mario eyeshadow palette by
Anastasia Beverly Hills that just
launched today I'm using the color Lula
and I'm applying that in my crease with
a small blending brush when I was
looking up different makeup ideas for
Selina the classic look that I wanted to
go for was the red lips and the winged
liner and a little bit of the shadow I
also not gonna lie I really wanted to
get like a pearl sparkly bra so that was
another reason that I chose this look
but I am just applying this right in my
crease and I'm applying a little more
than I normally would in the inner
part of my crease because this is gonna
add some more shadow and it's gonna make
my eyes look a little bit smaller I also
wanted to make my eyes look smaller for
this look so for eyeliner I'm gonna go
in and I originally did it a little bit
thinner with a tiny bit of a wing but in
a little bit I'm gonna go in and just
kind of thicken that line up a little
bit just to make my eyes look even
smaller
I'm grabbing the second highlight shade
from my Carli bybel palette and I'm
highlighting right underneath my brows
and I'm also highlighting in my tear
ducts so for lashes i'm using the demi
whispies by Ardell and i'm cutting them
in half i'm cutting like three big
chunks off the inner part i just wanted
to let you guys know exactly how much
I'm using I hate the word chunk and I
just said it for you guys by the way but
I wanted to add these just to the edges
of my eyelids you could probably get
away with like just mascara for this
look but I wanted my eyes could be a
little bit more weighed down on the ends
and to give my eyes like that more
sultry shape kind of like how she had it
and then I'm going in with a black eye
pencil and I'm lining my inner lower
lashline and also my upper inner
lashline and by doing this it's going to
make your eyes look a lot smaller so if
your eyes are small to begin with and
you're creating the Selena look you can
always just apply a black shadow like a
smudge black shadow on your lower lash
line and keep your inner lashline bare
that'll open up your eyes a little bit
so it's really all about preference I'm
using the Kat Von D shade and light
palette to bronze up my face a bit I'm
also applying this on my jawline and my
neck making sure that I'm tan all around
and here's the point where I'm just
gonna go in and thicken up the liner a
little bit I always like to start dinner
with liner that way if you need to fix
anything you can always go back in and
make it a little bit thicker so what I'm
also doing at this point is I am taking
a little bit of that gel liner and I'm
applying it with a slanted brush on my
lower lash line just to even make my
eyes a little bit smaller this part is
really optional just depending on your
eye size I have pretty round eyes so
that's why I decided to do that for
blush I'm using this pink color and I'm
applying it a little lower than I
normally would any picture that I saw it
seemed like her contour and blush were
pretty low on her face so that's why I'm
applying it like that for lips I'm using
this liner by Tarte I'm not sure the
name but I will list it below for you
guys and I'm
lining my lips for lipstick i swatched
so many reds and it was really hard for
me to find like the most perfect red I
noticed that her red that she wore was a
little bit more on the orange side so
since I couldn't find the perfect red in
my opinion I'm mixing a little bit of
this red from Anastacio and then a
little bit of this darker orange like
just the tiniest bit of that on top as
well so I'm just going in with a little
bit more of the contour shade and this
brush and I'm just contouring around my
nostrils a little bit
I just wanted to define my nose a little
bit more because in my opinion the nose
really changes the face so I really
wanted my nose to look as much like her
as possible so this is me just trying to
you know be really artsy in everything
and trying to make my nose like her cute
little nose so I'm putting a little bit
of gloss on my lips you guys know that I
hate gloss especially because my lips
are big to begin with but she always had
like a little bit of a glossy lip so I'm
just adding a tiny bit of gloss so now
moving on to hair I am sectioning it off
into two sections and I'm going to start
with the bottom half and I'm going to be
using this one and 1/2 inch curling iron
this thing is so old and it's made it
through so much and you could just tell
by looking at it that it's pretty
beat-up
but I didn't want to use a wand today I
wanted to use a regular curling iron
because the picture that I was basing my
look off of her hair wasn't curled but
it was like straight with a little bit
of curl in it so this is why I'm using
this type of iron I don't even know how
to explain how to use this curling iron
since my hair is so long I kind of do it
in like two sections where I'll like
curl the top and then I'll slowly feed
through the hair and then curl the
bottom part and then kind of like roll
it up so I'll just let you guys watch
instead of listening to me attempt to
explain what I'm doing at this point
sorry you can't film a Selena video and
not listen to her music at the same time
so I'm using this living proof hairspray
it's a softer hold hairspray so it's not
gonna leave it sticky whatsoever and
then I'm just gonna repeat the same
thing on the opposite side
so once you finish the bottom section
you're going to take the top section
split it into another two and then start
curling the top pieces as well
okay so once you finish the last piece
on the other side I'm gonna pin that bad
boy up as well and the reason I'm doing
this is because the front pieces always
fall the quickest for me and I'm gonna
be using the Bellamy side-swept bang for
this look I have mine in the color 1c
which is a little bit lighter than my
hair color which is crazy so
unfortunately it looks a little bit
different but I'm gonna make it work so
I'm gonna have to cut it a little bit
too so I'm going to show you guys how to
cut it and style it and all that good
stuff so you're just going to want to
remove the bobby pins from the front
pieces of your hair and you want to
figure out what side you want to part it
on I'm parting it on my right side so
the hair is coming to the left although
it looks opposite because filming's
and then I'm going to clip in the bangs
I'm going to take about an inch of hair
and flip it over clip in the bangs
there's three little clips and then I'm
gonna take that inch of hair and put it
over the bangs that way it looks more
real and more natural you guys can
really see the color difference on
camera I didn't even notice it was this
big in person but it's okay we're gonna
make it work so I'm going to clip back
my hair and I'm gonna just blow dry the
front pieces off camera really quick so
just give me one second so I just use a
little round brush and I just blew the
front forward that way I can see what
pieces that I want to cut so I'm just
grabbing the front pieces and I'm just
gonna cut them that way they're shorter
I did this exact look for my Kelly
Kapowski costume last year for those of
you guys wondering I know some of you
even said that my hair looked like Kelly
Kapowski well this is the exact thing
that I did last year so think of it as a
two-in-one tutorial so I'm just cutting
it start off a little longer than you
expect and then you can slowly cut them
a little bit more I'm just cutting it
straight across and then I'm gonna cut
like straight up and down to give it a
more natural type of look then I'm
grabbing my curling iron and I'm just
gonna curl the bangs downwards okay so
now that I have the bangs pretty much
good I'm gonna start teasing my hair the
photo that I am basing this hairstyle
off of I will show you guys right now so
you can see it she had a very high side
part and then her little fringe bangs
which I loved so I'm just gonna tease
this area to give it some more height
and some more body so you can just do
little pieces at a time I like to tease
and then I'll spray it at the end I also
just run my fingers through it just to
make it smooth out a little bit and to
look again more now
I'm also going to tease the opposite
side so one sides not like a million
times bigger than the other so next of
course comes the earrings and then next
is the outfit which you guys will see in
a minute but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video it was so much fun to create
this Celina inspired hair makeup and
outfit for you guys
this is the final result I absolutely
love how it came out
Selena is absolutely gorgeous and it was
such an honor to create this look for
you guys today so I hope you enjoyed
thank you so much for watching and until
next time I'll see you guys later
