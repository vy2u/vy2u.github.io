today's video I'm going to take you
through some of my past purchases from
Sephora I would say it's about three or
four trips from the past month or so
I think area I would combine them so
it's a little bit more of a haul some of
the products I've already tried and some
are still new fresh out of the package
it's so crazy because I think it's the
first time ever I'm filming at nighttime
so I went out and ran some errands I got
everything I needed to take care of and
I came home and I was like you know what
I feel like I should really film I
should do something it's Monday let me
start off the week right I promised you
guys three videos this week so with all
of that said if you guys want to see
what I got from Sephora please keep
watching so I got my bag right here
maybe I shouldn't do that it's filled of
some items they're all out of their
packaging because that's like the first
thing that I do when I get home they
will rip open the packages I test
everything out again and then I put it
all away because if I didn't then it
would be absolute chaos in here which it
normally is anyway but alright so some
of the recent things I picked up were
the first one that I'm grabbing it this
is the Asian zero shine by benefit I've
only tried this once but I actually
really liked the finish that left on my
face I definitely have to try it again
before I can say like 100% go out and
buy it
but I heard a lot of good things and
besides the benefit stay don't stray I
have like no other products from them so
I wanted to try another product from
them I heard some good things about this
powder it's just like a loose
translucent powder you could use it to
set your under eyes or just to kind of
mattify and blur out your fine lines
wrinkles all that good stuff next I have
the co Gendo aqua foundation in one for
three I use this in my last video and
I've used it for the past couple of days
and I'm obsessed with it I found out
about this foundation when Haru SH did
my makeup and I loved how my makeup
turned out so I went out and tried it
and it's just a really great foundation
I absolutely love it and leaves your
skin super super dewy and it gives you a
really nice coverage what I also bought
to add into this foundation or
the little cover effects jobs I used
these in the video as well I kind of
showed you how I applied it but that is
the exact routine that she did for me so
I wanted to go out and try it for myself
for myself I got these in NC 40 and n 25
so when I have a spray tan use the
darker one and then the lighter one for
my normal skin tone that's slowly coming
back it's so funny any of you guys who
get spray tans you know just juggle like
you're so so so tan and then one day you
just wake up and you're like really
really pale and you're like wait how did
that happen how did it just disappear
next I have the Beauty Blender solid
this is my second one ever and I used to
use the liquid Beauty Blender soap but
once I started using this it cleans it
so much quicker so much faster I had
mentioned did I mention this in a video
I definitely mentioned something about
the Beauty Blender and cleanser and I
know a lot of people had commented
mentioning a bunch of different cleaners
that worked for them so if you guys want
to again comment some of the cleaners
that you use that really clean your
Beautyblender well I'm sure a lot of
people would maybe want to look through
the comments and see some cheaper
alternatives so if any of you guys have
some tips you know it's always welcome
on my page just comment below next I
have the Laura Mercier high coverage
concealer in the number-three and this
is actually what I use today my makeup
has been on since 9:30 so it might not
look as good as it did this morning but
I just love the color of this it's a
beautiful salmon / orange concealer and
I just love the consistency of it when I
mixed this over the co Gendo Co Gendo I
just love the consistency of it and it
really covers those under-eye bags
well I also have it in number two but
the number three I've been using a lot
more because it's more of that orange e
salmon color which is gonna help
camouflage your eyes next I have the
cover FX custom infusion drops I got
this about three weeks ago this one is
for anti-aging and I only used it once
but it accidentally knocked over and
look how much
hissing you're supposed to just add it
into either your skincare or your
foundation I just added a couple drops
and gave you like a really really dewy
look but if you're setting your face
with powder anyway would you most likely
have to with a foundation and concealer
it kind of defeats the purpose of
looking super super dewy but I think
it's a really cool idea adding different
custom drops into your foundation for
people that have different needs this
one was the anti-aging so that's why I
decided to try this one next I have the
tarte full coverage concealer and
light/medium this is the second one ever
I just ran out of my other one so I had
to replace it this concealer is
definitely my other favorite it's very
very very similar to the consistency and
color of the laura mercier number three
I'm not sure which one is cheaper I'm
assuming the Tarte one is gonna be cheap
herb this is just like a perfect
everyday concealer you can keep it super
light or you can build it up to get even
more coverage again I use the whole
concealer tube and a lot of my makeup
I'll use it and I kind of find newer
things but this is one thing that I just
continue to use and actually ran out of
so next I have these little glam glow
sample masks it came in like a little
case of the three of them when I tried
it I almost positive it's been a couple
weeks I think I mixed the black and the
white one I want to get the sample pack
because I've heard so many people say
amazing things about it and I have had
allergic reactions in the past two
different masks so that's why I decided
to buy the sample one try each one out
and then see if I want to invest in
getting like the bigger size but so far
so good
I mean I'm the type of person that gets
a little lazy I feel like I've so many
steps at night already with the skincare
and the toner and serums and lotions uh
doing a mask is kind of not the first
thing on my list but I did try this a
few weeks ago and I don't know I didn't
really see an instant result but I guess
it's something you got to kind of use
continuously to see some sort of result
and you guys have any suggestions on
masks let me know I would love to hear
your opinion I love getting feedback on
something before I go out and buy it
because sometimes well I would say
majority of the time I'll read what they
say about it and then I'll read like the
online reviews but who knows if those
are even real so any suggestions are
always greatly appreciated next I have
the NARS Laguna bronzer
I've been using this a lot lately it's
just a really great color so at first I
was a little unsure if I would like it
especially when I had its hand but it's
actually a really really really nice
bronzer I love the consistency of it if
the lens really really smoothly it never
gives me like that blotchiness that I've
had in the past so this was definitely
something that I use all the time from a
recent Sephora purchase but I wanted to
let you guys know that this is probably
one of the most used items besides the
tarte concealer and i absolutely love it
so two more things the next is the
giorgio armani what is this called
master corrector and number one it's
like a peach pink tone I've actually
never tried it yet but I heard some good
things about it so I wanted to purchase
it I will be using it soon so I can give
you a better idea of how it works if any
of the products really really stood out
to you and you want like a real honest
opinion on it let me know and I'll make
sure I could try them quicker than maybe
the other ones just so I can get on
camera and then let you know what I
think of them if you guys are a little
unsure about purchasing so definitely
comment below and love reading your
comments and interacting with you guys
it's so fun and it's just really nice so
the last product is also by cover
effects and this is the total coverage
cream foundation I actually saw a
mention in one of her snapchats so of
course I had to go out and try it
um I actually haven't tried it yet but I
did just pick it up I had to exchange it
I got the wrong color because I bought
it online so I went in the store and I
actually like swatch a few this one is n
25 which is about my shade right now
looks a little light but I guess we'll
see so yeah that is basically it as far
as some of my recent Sephora purchases
again comment below let me know which
products you're dying to hear a review
about because I haven't tried a lot of
them and hauls are fun and all but it's
always great to know more about a
product I do plan on filming two more
videos for you guys this week so please
let me know what you guys want to see
because I don't want to have another
repeat of this morning and just kind of
have like writer's block and I think I
just get really hard on myself because
I'm like
they're gonna like this idea I don't
know if I should do this so any
recommendations are appreciated also
really quickly I wanted to mention I'm
wearing the new Bugatti Bellamy hair
extension so it came in like two pieces
it's like a 340 grams set and this piece
is like just the thickening piece so its
own it's like five clips and then four
clips but it's all one piece of hair and
it's awesome because it's the same like
that's my hair which the other ones I
was wearing we're actually shorter than
my hair and it just gives me the right
amount of thickness so I'm gonna do a
review on those if you guys want to see
them but I'm really excited because here
let's see you could see where my natural
hair ends which is like the frizzier
stuff right here and then the extensions
so like it's basically the same length
with the extensions are even like a
little bit longer so that is it for now
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
love you guys so much and until next
time I will see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
