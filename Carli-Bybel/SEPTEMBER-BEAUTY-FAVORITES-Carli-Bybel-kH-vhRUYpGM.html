October is officially here which is
absolutely crazy I'm seeing Halloween
tutorials go up which I feel like I'm
not even ready I haven't even started
planning a what I want to be for myself
for Halloween and be what tutorials I'm
gonna do for this year so I would love
suggestions from you guys if you can
comment below let me know what type of
Halloween looks you want to see this
year that way I can go pick up some
costumes and get going with some of
those but for today I wanted to sit down
and film a September favorites video for
you guys because there were a lot of new
products that I was continuously using
all throughout the month and I figured
it'd be a good time to share them with
you guys I had every intention on
filming something different for you guys
today but I don't have a lot of time we
had a family emergency this week and
I've been at the hospital basically
every single night so right after I
finished filming I'm gonna go head over
there my Papa had fallen last weekend
and he was getting really confused so my
grandma had brought him to the hospital
and there was blood in his brain and he
had to get surgery and it's just been
one thing after another so it's really
been a rough couple of days so I do
apologize that I didn't get any makeup
videos up this week but again I promise
through video so I wanted to get this
one up for you guys so if you guys have
a minute or two tonight I'm just asking
if you can send some prayers over to my
papa he is literally everything to me
he's my favorite man this entire world
and we are praying that he gets better
so with all of that said I'm gonna take
you guys through some of my favorites
from the past month so if you want to
hear what they are please keep watching
the first product I wanted to mention is
by a brand that I've never heard of I
was actually watching one of Gauss's
videos and he recommend this product so
I went out and tried it it is the
photography fluid and I believe the
company's name is neon I could be wrong
so when I heard him mention this I
wanted to try it because I liked the
concept of this product it's basically
like an illuminator that you can apply
with your foundation or underneath your
foundation it has a little bit of a
greenish tint what I've been doing is I
apply my lotion I apply my primer and
then I dab a little bit just right on my
high points of my cheeks the bridge of
my nose around my mouth because I get
some darkness around my mouth and also
in between my brows so I know
this that whenever I've been using it I
feel like my makeup is just kind of more
glowy and in pictures it looks brighter
which is really cool so I am personally
obsessed with this product at the moment
thank you guys for recommending it
because it really is cool and I don't
think I would have ever found it if it
weren't for him I've been using this a
lot lately and I absolutely love it
next I have this little eyebrow razor so
most of you are probably like do you
really shave your eyebrows um I actually
have not been using this for my eyebrows
a couple months ago I was with Nicole
called Guerrero not Nicole gandi no we
were getting ready in our bathroom and
she was telling me about this new razor
that she was using and she's like you've
never shaved your face I'm like shaved
my face no girl I don't shave my face
like I don't want all my hair growing
back like black and thick and she
explains me how that is not the case
whatsoever if you do shave your face
it's not going to grow back thicker than
it was before and it was actually really
funny because a few weeks prior to that
I went for a really cool facial where
she used like not a razor like this but
like a single blade and she took off all
the baby hairs on my face and it's
actually a form of exfoliating for your
skin it's removing that whole top layer
of dead skin on your face so not only is
it removing the little peach fuzz on
your face but it's removing all that
dead skin so it's going to make your
skin look more glowy it's gonna make
your makeup go on smoother it's gonna
just feel like a baby's butt and ever
since she showed me how to do it I have
been doing it all the time probably like
once every three weeks nothing crazy I
could do a tutorial if you guys want to
see this more in depth it's funny
because the first time that I tried it
she was sitting right next to me trying
to explain how to do it and I went like
this really hard and I had like a cut
down my face and I don't know if I
started bleeding but it was just a
little bit dramatic so it does take a
little bit of practice but once you
figure out how to do it it is really
really cool and I don't think I'll ever
go back to not doing it just for the
main fact that I love how my makeup goes
on so much smoother again you guys can
look into this a little further if you
want can get these at like your
drugstore I got this on Amazon they're
like three four dollars and it comes in
like a little three pack so again if you
guys want to see a tutorial on it let me
know or I can even like include it in
like another video so it's not a full
tutorial I'm shaving your face but it's
so cool and I'm so excited that I
started doing it Thank You Nicole
for always giving me such great tips and
tricks next up I have these two new
liquid lipsticks these are from gerard
cosmetics they actually just recently
launched i think last week
but I got them a little early so I have
been so obsessed with matte liquid
lipsticks they're basically the only
thing that I've been using lately they
just came out with these two new shades
called ecstasy and invasion I'll swatch
them next to each other so you can see
the difference but they're just such
gorgeous gorgeous shades I wore the
color ecstasy in my Sephora haul so if
you guys want to see it on you can see
how I applied it in that video but I
absolutely love them I love the colors
of them they don't leave your lips to
dry which is always something I look for
because some of the liquid lipsticks
that I had make my lips way too dry and
leave that line on that I believe they
have like four or five maybe six
different shades right now but these two
are definitely a must-have in my opinion
next up I have tan in the raw ultra
drying body shimmer this is a product
that Nicole also told me about when we
were in LA we went to the store Namie's
and I don't know if we found it in
Namie's and she had heard about it or
what really the case was maybe she had
tried it previously I didn't pick one up
while I was out there but I ordered this
one from Amazon and I used it after I
got a spray tan last time and it's just
amazing it's a great way to set your
self tanner that weights not going to
get all over your clothes and it has
like a really pretty shimmer to it so
sometimes what I do is like when I glued
the instant tan if I'm using like that
body bling or if I'm using like that
lotion that just kind of goes on instant
one thing I've noticed and it's kind of
inevitable or so I thought it was was
that whenever I would put clothes on or
when I was lean on something my tan
would just rub off funny storing me and
middle were out for my friend's birthday
recently and we had both drenched
ourselves in that instant self-tanner
and we were sitting at lunch just
sitting with our arms up there and after
the end of the lunch we looked down the
tablecloth right in front of the both of
us was literally pure orange from us
just like leaning on it just being there
all day so it was kind of really gross
so after that I was kind of like you
know what I need to go and try that
powder that Nicole recommended because
setting powder just wasn't cut in it so
I tried this it smells freakin amazing
which is awesome and it works really
great so if you guys love that instant
tan but you hate ruining your clothes
try this it comes with a big powder puff
and you can just apply the powder
wherever you apply the Tanner and it's
going to set it and keep it from ruin
your clothes next I have by Schwartz
Cody diamond color and radiance shine
boost tonic this I recently got about
two months ago and I've been using it a
lot whenever I curl my hair it's just a
shine spray so you just spray it once
you're finish and it just gives you like
that glossy high shiny finish I also
always use serum every single time I
shower when I get out I use an argan oil
or serum and I apply it on the ends of
my hair to keep it shiny as well next I
have these two brushes from Tarte that
I've been using a ton the past month the
first one is this little I don't know
why they don't have numbers on these
brushes but the first one is this little
kabuki brush first use this to apply my
foundation for the seminar that we did
and I actually already had it at home so
I've been using it to just kind of buff
on my foundation if I'm not using my
Beauty Blender which I kind of go back
and forth but I've been using this a lot
the past month so I wanted to mention it
and another brush is also by Tarte I
have used this in my last get ready with
me video and I couldn't find it online
anywhere so I'm either assuming that
it's brand new or coming out super super
soon so I will keep an eye out for you
guys this is the shape of the brush and
I've never seen a brush shaped like this
what I use this for is to apply the
powder underneath my eyes and it just
makes it so so so easy to get it on
evenly and it helps prevent you from
putting too much powder under your eyes
so this shape of this brush is perfect
I've been using it literally every
single time I've done my makeup the past
month and I'm obsessed so again I'll
keep an eye out for this brush for you
guys so next I wanted to show you the
NARS Pro palette I got this I'm going to
say a solid month ago they now have the
pans like this to make your own kit and
setup being in the containers which is
awesome because I mean I love having
blushes in the containers especially if
they look nice but it's much easier to
have them all together that way you can
mix up a few together and I just love
these blushes I think my most use have
been these two which I'll always mix
together if I'm doing a more pink which
is actually what I'm using today and
then these two right here which are
amazing as well I will list the colors I
don't know them right off hand but I
have the order list when I did place the
water online so I will list everything
below also these two contour powders
I've been
using a ton probably because I just kept
this right out on my desk and instead of
going in my browser jar and going my
brush drawer I just kind of have this
open it up and use it but these are the
two I think they're contour shades they
come with these little highlight sheets
as well so yeah I've been loving these
two the NARS blushes and bronzers are
just really creamy and they go on super
nice I will have to say though this one
highlighting powder I think it is that I
got is absolutely horrible it has no
pigmentation whatsoever which I was so
disappointed about like my $12 50 Carli
bybel palette has like 10 highlighters
in it and it's cheaper than this one
highlighter right here and it's much
more pigmented so a little disappointed
in the shade which I'll list below for
you guys but all these other blushes are
just incredible next I have the eyes
shadow called heroine I can't open it
heroine by Illamasqua
this I've had for a really really really
long time but I only recently started
using it a lot for a while I was using
the Kat Von D contour and highlight kit
which has the bronzer and the grayer
tone in it but this one I just kind of
kept out on my counter as well and it's
just been easy to use the past couple of
weeks so I always use this what I'll do
first for my nose contour is I use the
LA girl Pro conceal and beautiful bronze
which is hands-down my favorite to
contour my nose then I will blend it out
I will use this with a tapered brush to
go over those lines and then I'll use
the Beauty Blender to smooth it out and
then Li the different color powder over
it to kind of blend it more naturally if
you guys want to see that routine in
action I will link my most recent get
ready with me video so you guys can go
check that out to see how I use the
products so next I had to quickly
mention this because it was actually
sitting on my floor and I was like you
know what I've never mentioned these in
a video these are these little turbo
Turbie twist they're for your hair don't
mind all the fuzzies all over it um this
is for your hair when you get out of the
shower so instead of wasting an extra
towel to use on your hair they sell
these little things I think they come in
like a 3-pack I have a bunch of them and
it just saves laundry time so if you
guys are always using two towels to
shower I recommend trying one of these I
got these on
on and they're literally life-changing
can hang it on your door to let it dry
and reuse them I kind of have this weird
phobia to reuse towels once I've used
them once which is makes no sense
whatsoever but this makes it a lot
easier for me and the laundry because I
feel like my laundry is just filled with
so many towels and last but not least I
wanted to mention Sarafine lipstick
liquid lipstick by anastasiya this is
what I'm wearing on my lips right now
and the past there's two or three months
when I've done a red lip which is
probably only like three times this is
what I've used I just feel like it's the
most perfect red it's not too bright
it's a little bit of a mixture between a
cool and a warm red so that's kind of
why I like it I think it goes with a lot
of different outfits I feel like this is
the first time ever I'm wearing a red
shirt with red lips that's a little much
but before this I filmed this hair
tutorial and I had a different shirt on
and I wanted to sit down and then this
one for you guys really quick so that is
basically it for my October No September
favorites I usually don't do monthly
favorites but I felt the urge to do one
this month because there were a lot of
these products that I am continuously
using and they are really my favorites
usually I'll wait a few months in
between and then when I have a bunch of
products that's what I'll do it but this
time around I felt I had enough use of
some of these products that I wanted to
share them with you guys for anyone
looking for specific products hopefully
this video helped please comment below
on what Halloween videos you guys want
to see because I will be looking I will
be searching for your ideas and then I
will go out Monday or Tuesday of this
week and buy some new costumes some new
props all that good stuff so I love you
guys so much thank you for watching and
until next time I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
