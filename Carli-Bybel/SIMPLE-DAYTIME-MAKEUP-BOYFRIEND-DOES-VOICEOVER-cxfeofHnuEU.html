my face I have this on my face and it's
the same color of my skin here's the
pink little bubble pop and I'm gonna pop
my face with it so I'm grabbing this
popper and I'm gonna pop my tear ducts
and the angles of my face curvature so
I'm gonna keep patting myself up I wanna
brush the teeth of my nose now I'm gonna
brush the angle of my nose with this
line draw two big lines make an 11 on
your nose and you take this color that
looks just like the color I just put on
and you put another layer on and make
wings angel wings and then you blend
them in with the same pinky thing that
balloon looking ding then you make it
