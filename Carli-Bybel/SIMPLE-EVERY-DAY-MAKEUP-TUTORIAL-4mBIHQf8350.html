those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and tonight I wanted to sit
down and show you guys a super-realistic
everyday makeup routine I feel like it's
been a long time since I've shown you
guys like a simple quick easy routine
that is realistic for the mornings when
you don't have a lot of time a lot of
the time my videos are full I am full
contour highlight cream contour powder
under all the works which I personally
love it so much fun for me but on a day
to day basis I'm not doing my makeup
like that so I have a routine that I
have been doing for the past couple of
months that just really works for me if
I want to throw myself together in a
short period of time so if you guys
aren't already subscribed please hit
that button right here and if you click
the bell then you will get post
notifications every time I post my new
videos also I know last week I told you
guys I would do three videos but I
didn't realize it was a holiday weekend
so my time was a little bit short so
this week you will be getting three
videos one today one Friday and one
Sunday so make sure to check back on my
channel for those videos so if you guys
want to see my everyday makeup routine
then please keep watching so start up
today's look I'm using the Beca first
light primer the reason that I like this
one is because it's more of a liquid
primer so when I'm doing like my
everyday quick easy makeup I like to use
a powder foundation so I always like to
go in with a more liquid primer next up
I'm grabbing my shave tape in
light/medium and then anywhere that I
know I get like darkness throughout the
day and also if I have any pimples or
any dark spots and first I just like to
use my finger just really like push it
into the skin so at this point if you
have any areas that you want to color
correct you can do that as well we're
gonna blend the concealer in with the
Beauty Blender I don't even hook and
seal early prime my eyelids because I
have naturally dark eyelids so I just
kind of
it almost looks like shadow and though
I'll show you guys what I do after as
well so next I'm going in with my tart
powder foundation and like medium
neutral and I'm gonna take a little bit
with my brush I like to use the cap to
like wipe excess off and I just do
circular motions so I'm not gonna be
applying this under my eyes I'm gonna be
applying this all over my face
and then to set my under eyes that way
does increase I only use a tiny bit I'm
gonna go in with the light shade right
here so first I'm just gonna make sure
so we only did it I'm tiny but a
concealer you don't have to worry about
too much powder but I like to apply this
powder under my eyes because it sets it
a little bit better so just a very light
amount
I'm gonna do a little bit right in
between my brows as well cuz I get
pretty oily there so like throughout the
day so I like to just put a little bit
there as well then I like to add just a
little bit of bronzer because I'm very
light skinned right now and I like to
have a little bit of color in my face
again like I'm barely touching it I like
to just do it a little bit and then I
can always add more as I go because
honestly when I'm in a rush and I just
want to throw myself together I just do
these exact steps but usually I'll go
like a little bit quicker because they
won't be talking I'll just be like but I
really want to show you guys like a
realistic everyday makeup look because I
know I'm always on here showing like
dramatic full face looks and I know
realistically for majority of the
population I know there are some people
that like to glam every single day I'm
not one of those believe it or not there
is a routine that works that you know
it's a lot more lightweight on the skin
and that you can do in a very short
period of time now I'm just going back
with my brush I've had the foundation on
it
for brows I'm using the browse by
Anasazi Beverly Hills and ebony when I'm
doing a more natural makeup look I like
to just use the brow Wiz and not the
powder because then my brows look a
little bit too dark and made up and then
it doesn't really go with the rest of my
face
I just like to make them even any extend
them in certain areas try to make them
even I should say because my brows are
sisters nuts ones sometimes cousins and
then since I'm not using them kind I
like to set them I don't know where my
clear brow gel is so I'm gonna use this
ooh
model in a bottle stuff I used to use
this all the time it's more like a
liquid eyebrow setter I feel like this
one actually probably works better than
the brow gel because it's a little bit
more intense so if you guys are looking
for something don't really hold your
brows off this left's awesome Phillips
I'm going in with this lip liner by
bucks um it's called hush hush and it's
one of my favorites to do when I'm doing
like a more natural look just add some
color
so I line them and then lightly fill
them in like just a little bit and then
we'll use my finger to blend it out so
it's not too intense then I always like
to apply like a tiny bit of eyeshadow
into my crease I feel like it opens up
my eyes a bit so I'm gonna take a little
bit of this matte Brown from my palette
and when I mean a little bit like barely
touch it and then I'll just like add a
little bit of dimension into my eye it's
like I said I have like dark eyes for
some reason it almost looks like I'm
wearing eye shadow when I start but it's
not it's just the color of my eyes so I
will work with it because it makes it
look like I have a little something but
again I like to add this into my crease
because I really feel like it opens up
my eyes a bit at the same color we can
add a little bit to the bottom as well
just a little the reason I like to add a
little bit under here if you smile and
you see like where those lines are
underneath your eyes if you add a little
bit of shading right to that it's gonna
make your eyes appear more round as well
so I'll just do a little shake honestly
most days I won't even contour my nose
but I'm gonna do like a little bit just
to show you guys if some of you like to
contour when you're doing a more natural
look I'm just gonna take a little bit of
this gray tone and apply it on my nose
and also down on the sides
I'm going to take a little bit of this
highlighter right here
and then a little bit of blush and that
should be it so I'm going to go in with
this blush right here and I have a lash
extension so I'm going to just do a
little bit of mascara so I'll usually
just do the top and not even do the
bottom and then once I'm done with
everything I'm just going to take a big
fluffy brush this is my Sigma f30 tip it
like one more timings that's heart and
just make sure it's all like nicely
and final step is a little bit of
setting spray this is my lavender Mario
Badescu so this is the final result I
hope you guys enjoyed this video this
took me around like 12 minutes I would
say I didn't exactly time it but I was
talking a little bit through it so
normally this would take me ten minutes
and under because it's a routine I do
all the time I just kind of like know
how to do it super super quick but I
hope this video was helpful for those of
you guys may be looking for a new
routine that gives you decent coverage
but also makes you look put together in
a short period of time but I hope you
guys enjoyed I love you so much
and until next time I'll see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
