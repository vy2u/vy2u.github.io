today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this super easy spring makeup look
in 15 minutes exactly
I even timed it it's something I've been
doing a lot lately especially the past
two weeks if it's gotten a lot warmer
over here so I cut down on a lot of the
products and just found a routine that
works really well for me to just kind of
cover nicely and make me look put
together but in a short period of time
so if you guys want to see how I got
this look right here and then please
keep watching so I'm going to use a
stopwatch and I'm going to time myself
because the goal is to get this look
done in under 15 minutes so this exact
routine is something that I've been
doing a lot lately I know I've been kind
of m.i.a but I've been getting so much
stuff done around the house and
everything like that and it's just like
a really quick easy way to throw
yourself together to go run errands or
do whatever you bought at you so we're
going to start right so I'm using the
NYX pore filler for my primer I love
using a primer like this especially when
I get the warmer out because it helps
keep you looking more matte and it also
gets rid of any pores or anything like
that so I actually just recently started
using this primer again I had it for a
while I just hadn't used it in a while
and I really really love how my makeups
been staying so this is just the one
that I think grabbing for foundation I'm
using the Fionna styles matte foundation
in the color for this is just like a
perfect color for my skin tone when I
don't have a tan or fake tanner on and
I'm going to mix in a little bit of the
new Tarte rainforest of the sea drill
just like three
mix it together I'm not that all over
so I'm gonna closet literally for one
second because I have to go clean and
wet my beauty blender hitting start
again right now and I'm just going to
blend all of this in now sometimes when
I'm going to rush on music of powder
foundation and I'll literally just put
on super quick and go but this is what
I've been doing lately and I just feel
like it looks a little bit better
this colors literally the exact color of
my skin so I don't even need up to that
much of like neck which is very rare
because normally I am making my face
match my body which is like five shades
darker so I'm also going to apply just a
little bit of concealer I'm using the
medium light by it's harder I'm just
going to put a couple of dogs under my
eyes where we have darkness or if you
have any pimples that you want to cover
up you could do that step next I haven't
done the makeup look like this where
I've tied myself in a while feeling the
pressure but it's good because normally
if I am in a rush like I'll be rushing
like this so it kind of gives you a same
feeling as if you are really in a rush
okay I'm going to use a little bit of
the Kat Von D loose powder and I'm going
to just apply it with a dome brush like
this so just blend out any wrinkles I'm
not even going to look and so the powder
under your eyes is key I've tried going
without it but that's like the one thing
that I have to always do ever ever
applying concealer it really helps
prevent the creasing now you don't need
to use too too much but no hormone now
so for brows I'm going to use the
Anasazi umbrellas as always I literally
can't go a day without it I ran out of
the ebony so I only have it in Granite
so I'm just going to fill in my brows a
bit I think this is always the hardest
part I tried the micro bleeding out a
couple weeks ago so my brows are already
a little bit more so than than normal so
it definitely makes doing brows a lot
easier I go for my second appointment I
think in like a week or two so as you
guys want and let me know and I'll bring
my blonde camera I can blog it and then
fill you guys in the first time it's
definitely a lot lighter than its going
to be asked
overall so we'll see how it goes after
the second appointment and I'll let you
guys know all about it
so now I'm just going to wipe the powder
off and just kind of blend it in like
circular motions that way I can I kind
of set everywhere
even on my eyes
so we're at 6 minutes and 43 seconds all
right so I want to use my Carli bybel
deluxe edition palette which today is
the last day to get it for 1950 and then
the price will go up to 2250 and it will
also be launching in Ulta very very soon
so I'm picking up the other channel and
the first row is that orange color and
this is like literally the only color
that I use for like a quick easy look as
of right now at least so I'll just grab
that orange and I'll blend it into my
crease and just I go back and forth
between this orange and like the mob
shades especially for like a natural
look because it just adds a little
dimension I'm picking up the first
lighter orange as well as blending that
just calm it down a bit but it just
gives you like a little bit of steps in
your eyes and it keeps it very very
natural so I'm just doing that and then
I'm grabbing the same color and applying
it underneath it as well and I always
like to apply a little bit underneath
because it makes my eyes look more open
I don't know I find what I don't apply a
little something underneath my eyes with
a little smaller so it's just a little
trick I picked up a tiny bit of that
dark purple as well and just blend it on
the end I'm grabbing my contour kit and
my peepers blending brush from Sigma and
I'm going to just convert a little bit
of my nose so this stuff is obviously
completely optional but guys I like to
do a movie so
so we're just going to blend up and down
the sides just to make it look more
narrow
you always want to blend like the Condor
up into your crease as well that way it
just flows nicer so I'm just going to
use my blender and just kind of tap on
the side to line it up a bit so we're at
nine forty right now so I'm using my
next pin up tease and scare that just
got on my chest and I'm going to do in
this Cara
so now I love this mascara I love the
buffs on which is in my car right now so
I'm not going to go grab that one but
this one decent outside decent not great
because it cycled wet and it's like
getting everywhere so I'm just going to
use my little wipe and just wipe off any
of the black I'm going to go back in
with that same blending brush and I'm
just going to smooth out make sure
there's no black rating I'm going to
take this highlighter right here and I'm
just going to highlight the bridge of my
nose
and also in the corners my eyes
you
I'm going to take this since Kara again
and do a little bit on the lower lash
line
we're at 12 minutes and 23 seconds I'm
going to round up with deke at Bundy
myself a little panner
and then I also have a Milani baked
bronzer here as well going to give you
either pretty glow you guys know I don't
really like highlighter on my cheek so
this just give you like a pretty sheen
just a little bit I'm taking that same
brush maybe a tiny bit of powder on it
and I'm just kind of doing like circular
like wiping motions just to kind of
blend so it's not like so harsh and then
for blush I have about the new Chrissy
Teigen Becca palette I haven't tried it
yet but I figured it's right here why
not try it today so I'm taking this pink
color right here pretty guys at one
minute 1401
the blush and then lift some this is
next people
peekaboo neutral normally not actually
out as well
color pop I'm going to do that too and
then what I've been doing is just going
and why lips with minor and putting
chapstick on it's just easy
20 seconds 15 seconds
setting spray stop 15 hmm it's just all
because it's off of me so the only thing
that I want to do right now is I just
want to go with this brush again I'm
just looking a little bit of this like
peachy shade and I'm just gonna live hnd
yellow I'm just gonna like calm this
down a bit can you put it down a bit
because I am a little bit on the lighter
side now so we don't want it like too
harsh so that's really all I would do
I'm just out there on a shirt and fix my
hair I'll see you guys in a minute so
figured I would show you what I've been
doing because my hair is like insanely
long and frizzy and I'm just been so
lazy like not wanting to do it so all
I've been doing lately is especially
like running errands going to food store
like doing stuff like that I've just
been putting my hair in a low ponytail
like so my hair is Claire
so it could be like messy so these are
days where you're to brush and all
collecting your hair and then also go
ahead
then I'll just tuck it through the back
and then you're done so this is
literally like what I've been doing it's
super-easy covers my hair and I don't
really have to beep the time to make
sure it's smooth because lately when
I've been doing ponytails I don't know
why it's so well I dunno why but it's
just so hard to get looking smooth and
slick and all that stuff so especially
for was warmer out and everything like
that it's like totally acceptable to
wear a hat I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope this routine helps some of
you guys out there that are in a rush in
the morning and you don't have a lot of
time but you still enjoy yourself
together and look nice this entire
makeup looks to me exactly 15 minutes so
of course I'm going super fast with the
whole thing I probably should have done
it even faster but I was kind of talking
you guys a little bit and I had to find
everything in the chaos so what I
recommend is the night before if you
guys know you have a very short amount
of time to get ready try and like
prepare all your products in front of
you have everything kind of ready that
way when you sit down to get ready you
don't have to like scramble through
everything like dolls and try and find
stuff so I didn't do that I have chaos
in front of me so it was a little bit
harder to find everything but that is my
routine and what I've been doing lately
and it feels super lightweight on your
skin and it's been super warm here I had
no issues whatsoever and it lasted me
all day long so if I were to leave the
house right now what I would normally
bring with me is my lip liner my
chapstick and then maybe just like a
little bit of like a blotting powder or
something like that that way you get
really oily you can just kind of apply
it and then you're good to go
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and until
next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
