finally back with a new video I feel
like it has been so long since I have
film for you guys I was in London last
weekend with my sister
or something really exciting that I
won't be sharing with you guys so soon
like within the next we say two three
weeks tops so I can't wait to share with
you guys it's been something I've been
working on for the past nine months and
I was just absolutely blown away that
the time is almost here I can't wait to
share with you guys because it's
something that I wanted to do forever
and yeah so that's all I'm going to say
about that but I miss you guys so much I
feel like it's been a really long time
since I've done like a super dramatic
look so that's what I wanted to do for
you guys today I'm not sure what I'm
gonna call it kind of like a grungy
purpley smoke makeup look so that's what
I'm going with so you guys want to see
how I got this makeup look please keep
watching to start off this look I'm
priming my eyes with a concealer you can
use an eyeshadow base whichever you guys
prefer I like using a base every time
I'm doing heavy eye makeup and makes the
colors more pigmented and it just sticks
to it a lot better next I'm picking up
the light beige shade from my Carli
bybel palette and I'm applying this all
over my eyelid so of course I woke up
with four random pimples okay triangle I
always get random pimples like in
patterns on my face Wow
next I'm going in with this dark purple
color and I'm applying this with my
pencil brush on the outer V of my eye I
always like to do what I call a rough
draft before the final result so I like
to just put the colors where they're
supposed to go get them pretty dark and
then I go in and I blend afterwards so
with a smaller brush and this lighter
purple color from the same palette I'm
just gonna be drawing right above my
crease for this look I wanted a really
sharp looking crease so if you want
something more sharp and more precise
use this technique and it'll come out a
lot neater looking or if you prefer
something more blended and more like
smoky you could just use a blending
brush to apply this color
I'm grabbing that same color with my
pencil brush and I'm just very lightly
blending that right above the line this
is going to make it look more natural
from afar and it won't look like you
have some random line in your crease so
this part is important
with a clean blending brush I am just
gonna slowly blend out my work you want
to make sure when you're using this
brush that you are only blending up and
not down that way it stays nice and
precise nice and precise so I'm going in
with my pencil brush and that same dark
purple color I'm just adding a little
bit more color to it and then I'm
picking up this metallic purple color
and I'm applying that right next to the
darkest purple and then not quite all
the way halfway onto my lid because I'm
going to blend the white and the purple
together in a little bit
I'm then going back in with my pencil
brush and just darkening up the outer
edge so you can use anything with a flat
edge to get that perfect line or if you
want when doing an eye look like this
you can just do your eyes first and then
use a wipe to make sure it's a perfect
line that probably would have been
better but I honestly was going to do
something more natural so I had done my
face makeup prior but if I knew I had a
time I wasn't do a look like this I
probably would have done my makeup
afterwards that way any fallout doesn't
run the foundation or anything like that
so again it's all about preference I do
it both ways it's really just about
trial and error and seeing what works
best for you
I'm picking up a little bit of the
lighter mauve shade from my palette and
I'm applying this on top of where the
purple is and that's just going to help
the darker purple blend into a lighter
purple then with a smaller brush I'm
picking up the lightest highlighter
shade from my palette which has like
that pretty pink undertone and I'm just
going over where I had that nude shadow
it's gonna brighten it up a lot and it's
gonna give it a pretty shimmery look I'm
also applying that right in the tear
ducts of my eyes I'm doing it a little
bit more dramatic than I normally would
I'm going right up against where I have
my nose contour and up close you may not
see a big difference but from further
away you'll see by adding it a little
bit further onto your nose it's just
gonna make that inner corner really pop
I'm also applying the shade underneath
my brows and then I'm going in with
eyeliner this one is by Sigma and it is
called wicked and I'm just doing a
winged liner
For Lashes I am using the iconic lashes
they're super dramatic but I absolutely
love them for a really dramatic eye look
it just makes your eyes look super large
and really beautiful so that is what I'm
using for today and then I'm going to go
back in and just darken up all of the
colors and then just continue to blend
until it looks good in my eyes I like to
add all the extra color and all the
extra blending once I already have my
liner and lashes on especially if you're
doing this on other people it's good to
wait till you get the lashes and
everything on that way you can really
see how the eye is settling and which
way you should apply the shadows to
emphasis the eyes so that's really key
to this look that's why I always like to
do the rough draft first and then once
the liner and lashes are on you can
really go in and fix and darken wherever
you want mascara I'm using this one by
Tarte not gonna lie I prefer the other
Tarte one the one in the gold packaging
a lot better I couldn't find it it's
still packed away similar so I was
trying this one out but I had to keep
wiping it off of my eyelids because no
matter how gentle I was it was still
getting up on my eye shadow which o is
the worst especially when you take so
much time to do the eye shadow so for my
lower lash line I am using the darker
purple and then also the purple that I
used in my crease to give it a really
pretty blended look and then for my
inner lash line I'm using the same black
gel liner you can just use a pencil
liner if you prefer but if you want it
to stay literally all day if you use a
little bit of the gel liner literally it
will not move so if you guys are looking
for long wear makeup that's definitely
another trick that I just wanted to
point out I am bronzing up my face with
my Kat Von D shade and light palette
come here bear my boy
because I was liking my double then with
that same pink highlight shade I am
applying this on the tip of my nose and
also done the bridge of my nose in the
exclamation point like I always do learn
that trick from Nicole probably about
like a year ago and it definitely
changed my life
also I apologize I didn't show Cindy and
bear my last video I know I promised
that I would but they decided to join in
on this video while I was filming Cindy
just decided to jump up and bear will be
in in a little bit but I am applying
that same pink highlighter on my cheeks
I didn't realize how super pigmented
that they were so I applied a little bit
too much but I just wiped off my brush
and I'm blending in the rest and voila
you're glowing I absolutely love this
shade I am applying it on my other cheek
as well and the spy the first time I
born highlighter on my cheek since at
least like September or October I'd
given my cheeks a little bit of a break
but I'm not gonna lie I did miss it
so for lips I'm actually going to be
using a eyeliner this one's my color pop
it's only five dollars and I do have a
$5 off code which I will list for you
guys below this is like a really deep
plum color and I am just lining my lips
with this first
so now for liquid lipsticks I'm going to
be mixing two first I'm using the color
potion by anastasiya which is a really
really really deep smoked purple which I
absolutely love I would definitely wear
this color alone but I wanted to do like
a two-toned look for this so I'm also
mixing in sad girl right in the center
which has like a beautiful metallic
finish my cats are going crazy behind me
I am applying this again in the center
and I'm just blending it into the darker
shade so it gives it like that really
pretty ombre look these two mixed
together are literally my favorite I
love how this came out it's so different
and I love that little hint of the
metallic as well so with my Sunday Riley
loose powder I'm just applying this on
the edges of my lips and then also
underneath my contour lines I just
applied that because I'm applying a
little bit more lip liner and it'll help
prevent me from going over too far and
also it's going to make my cheekbones
look a little bit more chiseled so I'm
just applying a little bit more of each
color and then I'm just going in with
the liners just to kind of make sure it
all fades really nicely
and then I'm just blending off that
powder with that same brush that I use
to highlight
for blush I am using one of my favorite
shades at the moment this one is from
the BH nude blush palette and I am just
applying that on my cheeks
and then I'm going to be finishing off
this look with my Gerard cosmetics
lavender setting spray
so this is the final result I hope you
