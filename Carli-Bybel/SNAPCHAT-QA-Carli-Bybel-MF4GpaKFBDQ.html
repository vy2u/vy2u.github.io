so I hundred-percent no I was going to
film today and the original video that I
wanted to film was going to be my 2015
be favorite but as I was starting to
pick out my favorite products I realized
that so much of my stuff is still packed
so I feel like this video will be better
at a later date once I'm on pack so it
will be later than expected but I will
still do that video because I know I've
seen a lot of you guys requesting it I
didn't want to film say because I
finally found my little cam Ranger which
is the unit that hooks up my camera to
my iPad for those of you guys who are
asking I will link it below I got it
right on Amazon and it's a little bit
pricey but it saves the day especially
for those who wanted some on their own
and not someone sitting by the camera so
I figured I would do a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A I
didn't even post it or mention it yet so
I have to first make my snapchat public
um I was in the regular Q&amp;amp;A but I
figured instead of me like gold you're
picking the questions I'll just answer
them on the spot
and then that way you guys can be seen
in my video as well so who can send me
snaps everyone and then I'm gonna post a
little video and then start answering
some of your questions hi guys I just
made my snapchat public so send me your
questions I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A I am filming
right now I wonder what your questions
are going to be and make sure you guys
are sending me videos and not pictures
or chats because I want to show you guys
in my new videos so videos please I'm
only going to answering video ones
samantha fw potential what's your best
advice to cover up that skin i think the
number one thing that you should do is
figure out why
your skin so let's start with the number
one problem which is correcting your
skin find a new face wash or a new
product that's going to help clear out
your skin I definitely recommend if you
guys have a time if you have a little
bit of extra money maybe go seeing a
dermatologist and letting them help you
to help figure out what exactly is your
problem
I was going once a month for facials and
I noticed when I went she had told me
all about different products that she
was specifically used for my skin type
and I noticed that that helped me
immensely so instead of about learning
how to cover it let's try and get down
to the main problem and try and clear it
up but if you want to cover some pimples
or anything like that the NARS creamy
concealer is really thick and has really
good coverage I would also recommend
maybe using a fuller coverage foundation
but if you are going to be using these
heavier products on your skin you want
to make sure you're washing your face
morning and night make sure you're using
exfoliant moisturizer everything that
way you're not ruining your skin more by
any more more makeup onto it I hope that
answered it Jill underscore and Zalewski
I love seeing you guys umm well I do a
house tour I'm kind of torn um of course
I will show you guys at my beauty room
and my closet and all that one's all set
up but I don't know how I feel about it
you guys need to let me know we think I
know a lot of people want to see it but
I don't know plus for safety reasons I
don't know but let me know wait guys
think okay this is C underscore of own
it won't let me load could not refresh
please try again what happened here why
I want to let me open it guys they're
literally coming in and it won't let me
open them love you
oh I think the Cushman cut off a little
bit was how do I get all my inspiration
for my looks I always like to find
inspiration and things that don't have
to do makeup her anything like that like
I'll have a new shirt and I love her
print of it and it'll inspire me to use
those colors in the makeup look or her
earrings or jewelry and sometimes I'll
just be on Pinterest and I'll see like a
beautiful like painting and it'll
inspire me so I kind of get inspiration
from everything I don't know if that
really answers your question but I mean
I am inspired by so many things on this
by music by art by this by that so it
all kind of ties in to what I get my
inspiration from Jay love are 102 900
space suits in um I eat really healthy
I'm very lucky because I have bread I
haven't worked out as hard as I wanted
to like my stomach's game a little bit
flabby believe it or not guys aren't
think I'm crazy but um working out is
key just getting your heart pumping
eating really healthy I haven't been on
like a diet diet and so long I just eat
normal foods in portions and that's just
how I maintain my weight and I always
found that it works best for me I think
all these like crazy diets once you get
off that diet or if you can't afford it
anymore it's so hard and you're just
gained all that weight back so I think
my number one whose advice for anyone
trying to lose weight or maintain their
weight is to just do it the right way
it's not gonna be as quick as maybe some
of these other ways but it'll be way
more beneficial and way more
long-lasting for you guys um I will do a
new video with Brett me talking about my
diet
I know we owe you exercises so don't
think we forgot but now in our new
passing a lot more space so we will be
able to do a lot more for you guys this
is from hi and I'm gonna how cute are
you um so I actually didn't donate the
money it's my um because I was planning
I'm doing at least one or two more I do
have a paper that I wrote down all the
sales that I did collects from the eBay
so it's mining me around like three or
four thousand dollars that I will be
donating which is so awesome and yeah I
haven't done that yet thank you for
reminding me because I feel like at this
point a lot of stuff that I was financed
on I kind of just donated because it was
just taking a lot of time so I I'm
definitely going to be splitting it up
into at least two or three but I also
have screenshot seeds because you guys
would recommend some amazing charities
so I figured by I'm going to say and in
February I'll have that all taken care
of then ice cubes are gonna be a little
bit crazy but it's really exciting
because it's like four grand that's
something donated to charity all because
of you guys and some of my clothes from
eBay so thank you I'm so happy that you
love your mom for - it makes me so happy
alright I'm gonna just turn the setting
off for a minute because I'm missing all
of these okay so the next one is from
Emma Elfi us she's from Finland and
that's so cool
her question was when did I start my
makeup I remember in fifth grade I
wasn't on over any makeup but my mom let
me eat their summer
bison jumbo turquoise eyeliner looking
with those sick ones and I would wear a
thick line on my eye with like no
mascara no foundation no nothing but
somehow she let me wear that so I think
like on occasion I would wear that but I
didn't actually start wearing makeup
probably until like seventh grade where
I would just do the eye shadow it's so
funny because when I was growing up I
shot it was literally everything like it
didn't matter if your skin looks
flawless it was all about colors you're
using on your eyes and blah blah blah so
I remember I would wear like half my
eyelid like pink and then have my eye
look gold it's just funny thing about it
now because for the longest time it was
always my eyes for me like that was like
my one thing I had died wouldn't even
wear a foundation which if I thought I
try to now about foundation I feel it's
just so silly but just goes to show you
how much makeup has evolved or how much
I've learned the next one is from Taylor
Judy so funny um gosh I mean I would
love to I don't have like 100 I'm
running around here but I think for now
we're going to stick with to what you
just wanted to add if any of you guys
only have one cat I just wanted to fill
you guys in I had a cat one cat growing
up so I know what it's like to just live
with one cat but when I brought their
home and then they had each other like
you don't even understand the
relationship that they have with each
other they are best friends when he goes
to poop she has to go to coop with him
like they do everything together it's
the most sweet thing so I'm just so
grateful that we got bear as well
because not only is it so cool to see
like two different
Nelly's but it's just so nice to know
that they have each other so if we leave
the house we don't well I'm saying we
which Brett would probably fine but I
was taking Cindy everywhere with us
before we got there because I can bear
the thought of leaving her alone so I
mean I would love to get more maybe
we'll let them grow up and then go get a
new baby in a little few years or
something I have to talk to Brad about
that though because we went from having
zero packs to one and then two - it was
in like a week and that was never the
plan
so we shall see they're just so precious
though thank you guys I haven't thanked
each one but thank you guys for sending
in these questions next is five six mm
underscore 3 5 2 X this way like I put
it it's like just gone to our oh so she
her question was how to make the
foundation laughs because it I guess
what solve her um my number one tip and
trick that I recommend for you guys is a
moisturizer so wash your face in the
morning it's fully whatever you got to
do then apply your moisturizer then you
want to apply a good primer and the
reason that you want to do this is why
apply my moisturizer to moisturize your
face keep it nice and moisturized I
don't know the other word I was thinking
of and then you apply the primer in
between the moistures in the primer you
want to let the moisturizer drivers and
then you want to apply the primer so the
reason for that is since we
building if you keep it wet in between
and then apply the primer right away it
kind of defeats the whole purpose so
apply our moisturizer let it set then
apply your primer let it sit for a
little bit and then start your
foundation this will help keep your
foundation on all day another thing is
to make sure you're setting your
foundation with a powder whether you're
using a bronzer or you're using a
translucent powder or a Studio Fix
powder whatever powder that you're using
make sure you're using that because it
is left feeling sticky or tacky on your
face it's going to be a lot easier to
remove so the key is moisturizer primer
and then a powder to set it the next one
is from east slow the Nivea Post balm
shade no I'm having what is it I want to
try it can you let me know what it is
host balm shave Oh I'm assuming it's
like a body lotion no I haven't tried it
but I will look into it for you the
problem with my skin is I'm so sensitive
and usually I do something no fragrance
or no eye in it but I will definitely
look into it another thing I wanted to
mention while talking about skin is my
eczema has been gone for a couple days
now and as much as I had thought that it
was from a lotion or cream I really
think it has to do with my diet the
saddest thing ever but I think I'm
allergic to sushi oh so I would
literally eat sushi twice a week and I
realized when I stopped eating it my
eczema wouldn't flare and then when I
would eat sushi within hours I would be
reading and in my egg mode with layer so
it's under the worst thing ever I'm
allergic to animals I'm allergic to
fruit some of your vegetables and ours
to sushi just kill me thank God I found
two cats and I'm not allergic to because
I don't know what I would do without all
that stuff in my life like my favorite
things that Brown allergic to like why
what does that happen
what does that happen to so if you guys
have eczema trying to keep a food diary
trying to figure out what it is that can
be flaring it because no matter what
creams I use what prescriptions I use
nothing has seemed to make it feel
longer than like a week or two so
unfortunately I think it's salmon tuna
and those are my two favorites so the
next one is from a ZZ Top's you are so
cute and you look beautiful in that
makeup by the way like your skin's
amazing um when are mean bread getting
married never we're never getting
married
no I'm just kidding I don't know I think
it didn't happen this year but you know
what
no Rajesh me and him have a relationship
where it's since the beginning I always
knew that like it was going to be him
like we we talk about it all the time
he just wants to save his money and get
me my strings so no rush no pressure you
guys have been asking ever since I even
introduced into you guys but again I
don't know but what does happen you all
will be there with me I'm gonna
definitely get ready with me for my
wedding day so don't you worry it's
coming I mean I hope it's coming it
should be right
this is a tough one girl um that was
from Steph underscore a 96 by the way I
said that what is my favorite lip combo
to be honest I was gonna sit down and
some like my top 5 favorite lip combos
today but I figured I would say that for
a different day do you guys want to see
that by the way um my favorite lip combo
got to be world by Mac and goes the
colors stone it's just such a good lip
combo um I read all the time and it's
just like my go-to so I'm gonna say that
you know that were stripped down and
those of color stone just the perfect ma
shade and I love it the next one is from
Shelby underscore Mason one so watch
anyone from England um I love Fleur
Fleur de force she I believe is from
London I had the pleasure of meeting her
when we didn't want that runway a few
years ago I didn't she shows her so
sweet I definitely got along really well
and I got to see her again when I was in
London for beautycon so I watched her
videos I also watched so well of course
she's so cute I love her I think she's
hilarious um who else
I've watched like Caspar Lee I watching
all those like funny guys from London I
could go hilarious um but it's not like
I was every single upload like if I'm
randomly searching on YouTube I end up
always
their cages somehow watching their prank
videos and stuff like that but I think
that's really it as far as London
youtubers I love your accent by the way
I look my entire childhood was me
pretending to have that accent because I
wanted to be a Spice Girl so the next
one is from sapper onna
girl your makeup in ting literally
insane um how do I get through the hate
in the negativity I think that's a
question that I'm asked a lot actually
and one thing that I found is that
through the ears doing this YouTube
thing it's gotten a lot easier I'm a
normal human being just like you guys I
have feelings I have a regular life and
of course mean things are gonna get to
me but the one thing that I'm saying my
one piece of advice is to just find out
who you are and to just be a really
really good person in every aspect of
your life and just try to stay true to
your word and I think when you can do
that it doesn't matter what anyone says
about you because you know who you are
as a person and I think growing up the
biggest thing the hardest thing that we
all go through is trying to figure out
who we are and what we want to do and
all that sup and it's so hard and we
feel so much pressure and kind of lose
ourselves in that process so I always
say if anyone's like should I start a
youtube channel I'm always like yes do
it because you really find yourself and
you get to learn so much about yourself
because you're literally sitting in a
room by yourself building yourself and
if you're not comfortable doing it alone
you know that you're not
control with yourself yet it's just
about finding things that make you happy
and finding positive things about
yourself and not always looking in the
mirror and being like oh I hate this
about myself or I think this about
myself it's about finding stuff from the
inside that make you a good person and
those are the things that you need to
hold on to so for instance if someone's
going to come on they're helping all
these mean things I know what kind of
person I am I know what I did daily
basis I know how I treat others and I'm
completely confident in the type of
person that I am and it doesn't bother
me like it's something it doesn't bother
me it's just that I just try and let it
go instantly because it doesn't matter
what they're saying if there is someone
in your day-to-day daily physical life
that is making you feel bad about
yourself
I can understand this a lot harder I
mean you can make an account right now
on Instagram a fake account and go
comment something mean or negative on it
someone else's page and so we do do that
because there's no name there's no face
there's no picture well anyone who does
that clearly obviously has way too much
time on their hands and the only thing
that we can do together is to pray for
those type of people because the
negativity that they're sending out into
the world is only coming back to them 10
times harder so you can only feel bad in
them because they're clearly going
through a lot and yeah so I mean
remember what the question was but I
think the main thing that you guys need
to realize is that everyone will talk
 if you put yourself out there and
you try and do something positive for
yourself there will always be someone
trying to tell you that you're doing it
wrong or not good enough or that ignore
the negativity if you have positive
stuff coming in focus on that respond
and communicate with those types of
people because they're the ones we're
going to lift you up and bring you up
and those are the only people that
or anyone who's trying to bring you down
screw them and get them out of your life
and just realize if you're worth it
you can do anything that you want to do
literally anything and our time here is
so limited so why Reese another minute
and well in someone else's negativity
just be proud of who you are be proud of
what you're doing and if you're not
proud then make changes into finding
ways that you could be proud of yourself
so so cute that was from these oh so
vogue um you're so cute by the way
if I could get a penguin and I could
name it I don't even know oh my god oh
you've no idea how hard it was to pick
kitten names like for us to name the cat
Cindy was already named Cindy because
she Cindy Crawford Chisholm all easy but
bear like you've no idea it's just so
long to name it so I think I would have
to meet the payment and have to play
with it for a little bit and then I
would figure out its name because I feel
like you can't name something that
doesn't exist yet right so when I get
that pet pain when I will let me know
girl and the next question that you had
was I don't remember
oh we play yeah okay it's my favorite
song on my playlist it's so hard I have
not updated my music in my playlist and
literally like five years
breck it so mad because we're in the car
the same songs are on over and over and
over again I would say Moran is
something my Miranda Lambert cuz she's
just everything to me right now Miranda
Lambert what song I love this song love
song that's like one of my favorites I
else sing that at the top of my lungs in
the car and I think that's probably one
my favorites but anything my Miranda
Lambert I'm loving
lately we've been listening to that a
lot what else
Russell laughing Isabella you know all
that country depressing music as someone
you would say the next one is from Sam
Towson my top three make up cause I
can't live without um definitely my
grammar to go because I need to fill in
my eyebrows like ever since I learned
how to fill my eyebrows and think it
changed my life it changed my whole face
um uh uh what some Skara of course we
love mascara telescopic and then my
third will have to be I guess concealer
because my since pretty clear so if I
didn't need foundation I would survive
but I love concealer the ones that I've
been using on the new Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD good for like a daytime look or
a more dramatic look because it's it's
pretty thin so you can layer it um so I
we want to see that as well
oh that was Erica Alisha one you're so
cute well first of all thank you I'm
glad that you think Cindy embarr like
eat a little big fluff there little big
fluff balls I say um I think I told you
guys I barely know allergy attacks so he
lost most of his hair but um crap what
was your first question I give me any
celebrity who would it be
um Taylor Swift easy done I would die to
meet her she's literally everything I
know that we would be best friends and I
know one day only heard so one day I
will and I will try my best not to
fangirl because I mean Who am I kidding
I devil what are their short hair this
is from it's me and ELISA your English
was perfect by the way don't ever
apologize because you sounded amazing I
remember the first time I wonder cut my
hair really short was when I was a
freshman in high school a lot of my
friends had cut their hair like up to
here it was like that that thing that
was popular for a while I was like the
scene look that's seen here with those
deep bangs and they're really choppy
short hair so all night literally all my
friends did it and I want it so bad but
I never actually cut it but yeah I've
thought about it I mean it I add this
one of my life I feel like it won't
happen because this is how long my hair
is it took me 10 years to grow it back
but I love lately like the love it's
called it that long bond that's like
maybe it right here that's like really
blunt cut so if I want to do anything it
would be that but I don't
that I will do it just because I don't
think I have it in me to cut that much
off but I think it's so beautiful I love
short hair so and the beauty of short
hair is that you have short hair you
don't extensions but I born extensions
like my entire life ever since like
senior year of high school so it's nice
to give my head a little bit of a break
this is from Michaela Gasland good
question my favorite restaurant in New
York City
oh that's a hard question because
there's a few good ones is Mexican place
I think it's called Rosa Mexicano
amazing amazing guacamole that they make
fresh right in front of you then when I
ever go blonde Brett wants me to go
blonde but I just think I look
absolutely ridiculous lon
when I was younger I wanted my hair I
was poly in like seventh grade I wanted
my hair to be like blond like Shakira
blonde like Alicia bleach bleach blonde
so I went to my hairdresser showed her
picture literally my plan she cared hair
was belong and I walk out of there with
tiny thin string of highlights with my
dark hair and like blonde ugly shy
highlights so I because that was like I
don't know that kind of like killed it
for me and I haven't charred ever since
but I don't know maybe one day you look
really silly blonde though
next question from Sabrina's Oh what
lipstick I'm wearing right now
I literally mix like 100 I am wearing
first I get well liner and I did those a
color stone and now I'm gonna do this
every single day
a little brown to it so then I used
Taurus lippy stick by kathleenlights by
the color pop and then I used a brown on
song via lip gloss so much or the exact
color and it was too glossy so I put a
little bit of Laura Mercier translucent
powder over it so that's that color on
my lips the next one from Yuki EXO what
make a product did not expect to love as
much as I do now
I guess that only land from a mascara
because you guys know me and I've only
ever used one mascara and when I tried
it I was actually really pleasantly
surprised and I've been using it a lot
so I think that has to be it because if
you can break me out of my L'Oreal
telescopic cycle it must be pretty
special Abbie Hoffman 18-wheelers my
natural hair my natural hair is
definitely a little bit lighter than
what it is right now it's like a medium
brown when I was a little baby it was
like blonde in the summertime like like
dirty blonde but my hair is always been
brown my question is what's your advice
to finding that Gigi Morales so sweet so
she asks how to look for good qualities
and a guy um it's really hard there's a
lot of assholes and guys can be known
for being assholes I think the number
one thing to look for is someone who's
going to respect you it's also about
figuring out what it is that you're
looking for I think the best thing about
dating around us is trying to find like
what like you don't like in a
relationship because if you don't have
relationships or you don't have dating
experiences you don't really know what
you want versus what you don't want
there were different scenarios where I
would be dating someone and they were
completely content with just how it was
and how everything was going and they
had no intention of leaving but there
was no intention of really going any
further and for me I always knew that
like I was inside girl just wanted to
hook up with people like I wanted a
relationship I wanted love and I wanted
to be happy so I would maybe thank
someone a few months and then I could
just tell it that they weren't really
the person that would give me everything
that I needed because I require a lot of
love and attention so I would just end
it and I wouldn't make a list of what I
want and what I didn't want no make a
mental list and I would keep track of
like what I found attractive in someone
what I didn't want
in somebody so I think the number one
thing is just knowing what you want and
never settling for any less than that
also you can't really find someone who's
gonna love and respect you until you can
love and respect yourself because if you
don't know how to love and respect
yourself you'll never know if someone
else is giving you the amount of love
and respect that you need so take your
time don't rush and really just get to
know someone um another tip is don't
sleep with them on the first date don't
sleep with them until you know that
they're the right
or that there's someone you want to date
that was from Debbie Hubbard I love you
too and yes Brett is a Chiefs fan
because the reason I started liking the
Chiefs was because they were the color
red believe it or not this was when he
was like a little little little boy he's
loved the cheese ever since and so
amazing that they're doing so well who's
been in the best mood ever and the first
thing that we started dating was when
they first really really started doing
well so I said all right so the first
year we started dating they did really
really well sine started dating
obviously I think you're like obviously
they start doing well so some dead find
so many levels like yeah guys that I
really sit there watch your videos like
crazy and I Tony watch something even
telling you're so sweet oh my god I love
you literally have a tear in my eye Emma
Belle long what inspired me to start
YouTube um the reason that I started
YouTube I was doing freelance work and I
started doing YouTube because whenever I
go to those houses like I've been calm
since we see season stuff like that and
they always be like I love your eye
shadow how did he do it and I figured
instead of because I would sit there and
write out everything that I use for
these people so I figured instead I
would film video
and then it would be easier that way you
have to follow along with me and this
was almost four and a half years ago I
guess maybe it is for nine years going
out and it's just so crazy what this is
turned into like seriously pinch me I
still feel like I'm dreaming I still
doesn't feel real like I don't let
anything actually sink in and feel real
I don't know why but it's so crazy and
yeah that's why I started YouTube and I
the reason I continued with YouTube
because I could get a lot of hate
especially from people in my own
hometown was because the people that
commented you guys you guys commenting
sweet things and tell me how much you
liked it and that you enjoyed me and
that's the only reason I'm still doing
YouTube because I probably wouldn't even
up really quickly I hadn't received all
the love that happen by some thinking I
just wonder you're so beautiful
I'm all sweet that was to Zelena Joe
Selena we're pregame from Brazil which
is awesome how do I deal with rumors um
to be honest there's a lot of rumors um
I kind of I guess it's kind of ties back
into that here question there's a lot of
hate blogs out there which is completely
find people and make up rumors so I
guess the only way to really deal with
it is to just know that whoever's
writing that is clearly jealous
and have some sort of built-up hatred
for you which I think really reflects on
themselves
um but you just kind of ignore it as
long as again like I said earlier as
long as you know who you are and what
your goal is and what your message is
that you're sending to the world like
screw everybody else seriously just be
proud of who you are be proud of what
you're doing and I think everything else
is kind of slowly fall into place I know
it's very hard and it's so much easier
said than done and my camera just died
and I don't know where the other battery
is nor do I know where the battery
charger is ooh what was that noise that
came out of me so I answered about an
hour worth of questions I didn't get to
do an outro so this is in my little
outro for you guys um again moving is
just oh so fun when we can't find
anything that you need but I would have
loved to answer a lot more a lot of the
questions were really really similar if
you guys have any other questions you
want me to answer definitely comment
