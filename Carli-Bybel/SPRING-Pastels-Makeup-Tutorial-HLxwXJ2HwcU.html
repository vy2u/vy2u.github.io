and I
hi everybody thank you for watching in
today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this Easter inspired makeup look
it was also inspired by my ludora
boutique earrings they have really
pretty pastel colors on them so I
figured why not do something bright and
colorful since it's been quite a bit
since I've posted anything like that on
my channel so really quickly before I
start this video I just wanted to
address something because I woke up to
floods of comments of people just being
absolutely hurtful and one thing you
guys have to realize is just because I
sit in front of the camera and I am all
dolled up and I take selfies and I do
makeup and yada yada yada that doesn't
mean that I don't get hurt by things
that you say and the reason that I
delete negative comments isn't because I
want everyone to praise me it's because
I don't want the negativity in my life
and it's not fun waking not breeding all
those things so what you guys have to
realize is that there's absolutely zero
zero zero drama between me and Nicole we
talked about it this weekend we hung out
this weekend and we actually had the
best time ever
her boyfriend Jeremy and Brett actually
have this new bromance and it's really
cute and we actually planned a vacation
together and yeah so just so you guys
know there's no drama
so stop sitting on my page bashing me
bashing Nicole because we don't care
we're over it and we're laughing about
the situation so you could do the same
stop believing everything you read and
stop making up crazy stories because all
of it is absolute garbage everything
that I said in my Beyonce video about
what actually happened with my videos is
the absolute truth I have never lied to
you guys and I cannot sit here and lie
because that's just not the type of
person I am I think some of you guys
have some other issues that you need to
deal with on your own and your own life
and stop taking it out on me because
every single quote that I put in my
video every single everything the way I
act this is who I am I'm not faking it
I'm not trying to be somebody that I'm
not this is just me so most of you guys
already know that and I love you guys
and all of your support has literally
meant everything to me but for all of
you who don't like me and you just want
to continue to hate me that's fine there
are many blogs where people sit around
bashing me all day and if that's how you
want to spend an occupy your time so be
it just keep it off my page please
there's no drama going on I personally
Nicolle just as most of you do as well
and yeah I think that's it so enough of
the rambling because I didn't even want
to go back into the past anymore and if
you want to learn how to get this Easter
inspired look please keep watching to
start off this look I'm taking my
charged water by Mac and I'm spraying it
right onto my full exposure palette
which is gonna be the first palette I'm
using and the reason I'm doing this
before I pick up this champagne color is
because it's going to get the brush a
little bit wet and it's gonna help keep
the color extra pigmented so I won't
have to keep dipping back into that same
color I'm applying the champagne color
on the inner part of my lid also
underneath my brow to highlight it
next up I'm grabbing my galaxy chic
palette and I'm thinking the color
called comet and it's a really pretty
mint color and before I picked up this
shadow I also dipped it into that
charged water as well usually I'll use
fix+ but I'm out of that you can also
use eye drops in place of this I'm
applying this color on the outer half of
my eye and I'm going to very lightly
blend it into the champagne color
picking up my blending brush and the
full exposure palette I'm sorry I don't
have a little clip of this but I'm just
using the matte brown color and it's a
light brown color and I'm just applying
this right into the crease of my eye
just to give my eyes some more dimension
next up I'm grabbing the color earth
from my galaxy palette with this smaller
angled brush and I'm lining my lower
lashline
from my new Urban Decay electric palette
I'm picking up this hot pink color and
I'm lining right underneath that
turquoise line this pink was a little
bit too bright so I'm picking up the
color milky way and I'm applying it
right over that to give it more of a
sheer shiny pink color then picking up
my gel liner I'm lining my upper lash
line and depending on your eye shape of
course to do the liner that looks best
for you I always like to overextend it
in the inner corner of my eye and I
really like a long tail for lashes I'm
using these by Mac I'm not trying the
number but I will post everything on my
blog as usual but I am just applying
these and then I'm applying my favorite
mascara which is my L'Oreal telescopic
so whenever I reuse these lashes they
get a little bit straight so for the
first time in my life as of reason I'm
using a eyelash curler and it's very
funky but you have to get used to it and
then I'm lining my inner lash line with
a black eyeliner
for blush I'm using this light pink
color and I'm applying it all over the
apples of my cheeks
then to highlight a bit I'm using this
new highlighter I got from Sephora this
one is called light beam and I'm
applying them right above where I
applied my blush and it's gonna give you
a really pretty subtle highlight
to line my lips I'm using 20 and this
part I actually missed off camera but
then right over that I'm using cotton
candy lipstick by motives
and then over that's give it a later
finish I'm using creme de nude by Mac
and then to top it off I'm using the
color Fiji by whitening lightening and
it's a really pretty pink gloss
to finish this look off I'm using that
same original champagne color that I use
on my eyes and I'm highlighting right on
my Cupid's bow so this is the final
result I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you all have an amazing
Easter for those of you who celebrate it
and if anyone celebrated Passover over
the weekend I hope you had an amazing
time as well I spent some time with my
family and that's why I've been crazy
busy but I wanted to get this other
video up for you guys this week so I
didn't completely leave you in the dark
for like two weeks because I feel like
it's been a really long time but I love
you guys so much seriously every single
one of you you are amazing so until next
time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
