Barrow in the basket look
how cute you are
hi everybody thank you for watching I
missed you guys so much I feel like I
have been gone forever I have been
editing my vlog from my trip but there's
just so much footage because the trip
was in total 11 days so I'm trying to
see if I can fit it into one but I feel
like I'm going to ends up breaking that
into two so since I'm speaking a little
longer than usual I wanted to sit down
and finally film today for you guys and
of course I wanted to get back to my
normal filming schedule but yesterday we
got a new family member so it's been
really hard to get anything done she was
sitting on my lap while I was getting
ready I've been up since 8:00 and I
think it's around like 1 o'clock right
now so I just figured I would talk to
you guys update you on some things that
I've been going on show you the new baby
and then I promise my next video that
I'm filming either tomorrow or Friday
will be a makeup video and I'll be back
to my normal scheduling so thank you for
being so patient while I've been away
it was definitely one of the best trips
that I have ever been on in my entire
life so if you guys want to hear a
little bit more then please keep
watching so Fisher the baby first but
she's laying up there with bear and this
is the first time that they're actually
laying together so I will show you her
in a little bit you can stop this video
right now so check out my snapchat if
you can't wait any longer but I just
wanted to fill you guys in because I
have not filmed anything or been on
YouTube in so long so if you guys don't
have any other social media and you
don't know where I've been I was in
Malaysia Cambodia Bali and Singapore all
in 11 days so it was such an amazing
trip our flights to Malaysia we had a
stop first in Taipei
so it was like a 19-hour flight to
Taipei and then like a 4-hour flight
from Taipei to Malaysia so the first
step was Malaysia for the influence Asia
Awards I've here hunted the top beauty
award with Shannon and
and Brett presented the top fitness and
health Awards and there were seven
different countries I have like such a
fear of public speaking
so the thought of like going on stage in
front of thousands of people was so
nerve-wracking but all that I thought I
had to do was say and the winner is
and then that'd be it but then the night
before we were all at dinner and they
told us that there's going to be seven
different winners and we have like a
paragraph each to say we had such a
great time in Malaysia after the awards
show we all went out to the club we were
also with Judy and Benji who are the
cutest couple ever so we had dinner we
went out to a club we had such a great
night and then super early the next
morning we left for Cambodia so Cambodia
was so much more than I ever expected it
was definitely the most life-changing
experience that I've ever been through
my entire life we're already planning
our trip back there so it was really
cool because I got to go out there and
meet with the founder of the WHA
Foundation which is the foundation that
I have my scholarship with and he took
us around and the first night we just
had dinner we settled into our hotel and
then the second day we woke up super
early and we went over to the Bright
Hope Institute which is the school where
the girls that will be attending college
with my scholarship will be going so
with the money that we raised they're
also building brand new dorms for
everybody so you're going to see videos
of all of this but I feel like when I
was away I did a lot of like scenery
shots and not as much talking to the
camera so I figured you know what let me
talk about it first and then you guys
will get to watch it all and you won't
be confused as to what's really going on
can we take a second look at my children
there's me baby given
okay so we went to the Bright Hope
Institute I think there was like 16
girls out of the 32 that will be
attending for the first year so this is
a four-year scholarship where I will be
sending 32 girls at least every single
year for four years so that's where you
get the 120 and they took us around they
showed us the dorm rooms that some of
the girls are currently living in and it
was super crammed there were clothes and
books and everything all over their bed
so as soon as I walked in there like my
heart just broke and I was like oh I
can't wait to see the new dorms that
they're going to be building for these
girls so they had started a bunch up the
steps so we went upstairs and we saw
what it was looking like and it was so
nice they had a beautiful desk area for
all the girls where they can store their
books above it they had cubbies so they
can all hang up their clothes and have
their clothes away and that way they can
keep their space neat and have just more
room for themselves and more privacy so
it looks so amazing I can't wait to see
them all built out when we go back in
September the people that work at the
Bright Hope Institute provided like a
PowerPoint presentation just showing us
how they choose the girls and all about
their school and different things that
they do to give back and everything like
that it was a really cool experience to
hear more about it just to you know when
you're halfway across the world and
you're doing something so huge you want
to make sure the charity that you're
working with is a all the money is going
to go to the right place and be the
charity's actually putting the time in
the effort to make the community better
so I got to go and meet some of the
girls in the classroom I gave them all a
talent and a bracelet and I did make up
for some of the girls and unfortunately
they didn't speak English so I wasn't
able to communicate with them but I
talked in front of the class and then
they had someone translate it for me and
when I had each girl come up for her
gift they all hugged me and kissed me
and it was just like literally the most
beautiful experience ever they were so
grateful and just to see like that
twinkle in their eye I was just so
amazing I was literally holding back
tears the entire time I presented the
big check and that was how we started
our morning off so it was amazing and
then we went over to an orphanage across
the street from where we were staying
and the guy press the founder of the
foundation he goes to Cambodia all the
time and this is one orphanage he works
with in particular because the owners of
it are just so sweet and so amazing and
we went there for a few hours we played
some games and we got to meet all the
little babies so I know some of you guys
were watching it on snapchat and got to
see what was going on so that was
literally like the second highlight of
my trip obviously it was so amazing
getting to meet the girls that we'll be
helping but just seeing the little kids
and hearing some of their stories and
how they really don't have much but
they're so happy and they're just so
loving that was just such a beautiful
experience and I literally cannot wait
to go back we were not there long enough
we were only in Cambodia I believe on
two nights so three days but we were
traveling the first night traveling the
last night so it was way too quick so we
are planning a trip back in September to
present the rest of the money that we
are still going with so our next goal is
200,000 so we are almost there which is
so amazing all because of you guys so I
really really appreciate it and then
after that we actually went around and
Chris showed us some of the schools
where he provides clean water laugh
foundation stands for water and Health
Care Foundation so they started it
providing clean water to communities for
dental hygiene and also to wash their
hands and also to drink clean water so
many kids were dying in Cambodia because
they didn't have clean water to wash
their hands with him brush their teeth
with which is just absolutely crazy so
what I thought was so amazing is what
he's doing is he's not trying to just
build with these equipments and throw
them all over Cambodia and move on what
he's doing is he has teams that go into
the communities and they teach them how
it works and they get them involved and
they get them excited about it and they
work with them one-on-one for years now
and they make sure that the whole
community is stabilized which is still
amazing so we went around to a few
schools got to meet some more kids and
that was the trip to Cambodia once you
guys see all this footage you're going
to just cry like it was just amazing and
I cannot wait to go back wood there was
also so good like so good it was so nice
they had vegan options for us everywhere
we went which was so nice we didn't even
have to like ask and the food was just
incredible sauces and the veggies
everything was so fresh then after
Cambodia we went to Bali for a few days
to relax
so that was like our relaxing part of
the trip we stayed in this beautiful
villa that overlooks like this huge
jungle it was when I tell you like the
most peaceful place like I feel like
I've been there before and I just felt
like I like belong there it's such a
spiritual island and one of the things
that stood out to me why I thought it
was like so amazing is for their new
year they have 24 hours of pure blackout
so the airport shuts down everyone shuts
off their lights and they just had 24
hours to reflect on the year that pass
and to think about all of the things
that they want for the future so I just
thought that was such a beautiful things
especially for the airport to shutdown
that just goes to show you that if
they're not all just about money like
basically everywhere else that they are
very spiritual so it was just such an
amazing feeling being there we would
wake up super early and go to breakfast
and we would just sit there for like an
extra hour just like looking at the
views and just taking it all in and the
air was just so fresh the fruit was
literally picked from the garden like we
could see the garden like that's how
fresh everything was our friends Ken and
Leslie are actually living in Bali so we
didn't really want to relax they had
said like I'll take a few days to relax
I'm just kind of like lay by the pool
and do all that and we didn't want to do
that at all we really wanted to see the
island and we wanted to do things so
since they have lived there for over a
year they took us to some of the amazing
parts of Bali we saw some temples we
went to see the rice fields we did
whitewater rafting we went to the mud
forest I literally had baby monkeys
jumping on me it was the coolest thing
ever and it's funny because baby chai
reminds us of a little monkey because
she has with folded ears down we had so
much fun in Bali that is not going to be
the last time that I'm going I think
when we go out to Cambodia in September
we're going to extend our trip even
longer and we're going to do Bali again
because there's so many things that I
wanted to do that we just didn't have
enough time to do and again who knows
maybe I'll end up moving there one day
and then we finish our trip off in
Singapore and we were only there like
one full day we had dinner at Chris the
founder of the foundation he lives in
Singapore so he hosted a beautiful
dinner at his house for us and it was so
amazing they are just such great people
and it's so nice to just be around like
good genuine people that love the same
things that you do and that love
back and it just it was really nice and
it just made me so happy that I decided
to work with this foundation because I
know for sure every single dollar that
we've donated will be used for an
amazing cause and if there's anyone that
needs it it's the people in Cambodia and
they're so deserving of it and they're
so grateful and just such amazing people
so Singapore last day we saw the gardens
we went and had dinner on I'll show you
guys a picture really quick it's like
three hotels and like it looks like a
huge cruise ship on top so this is kind
of how it ties into my story with chai
so I'll tell you the story now and then
I'll show you how because I know you
guys are dying to see her all day we
were driving around Singapore me and
Brett and we kept seeing this hotel or I
guess yes a hotel but with like a huge
restaurant on top and we really what is
that we kept taking pictures of it so we
are sitting in that restaurant and
actually let me back track a little bit
so I can get into the end of that story
and the beginning of baby chai so um
I've wanted a fourth one for a long time
now I'll tell you our really cheesy or
my really cheesy reasoning behind it um
so when I was in high school like me and
Brett dated a little bit on and off and
well there just jumped up behind me so
we did a little bit in high school and I
used to be like really cheesy I used to
like doodle so I'm CB and he's VC so I
used to always write like CBBC like all
over my binders and my notebooks and
like it's just something that I always
thought was like meant to be so we have
like so many like weird connections were
like with our families a paper same name
same birthdays like crazy stuff like
that so we're like really big and all
that kind of stuff and it just so
happened when we got Cindy her name they
actually already named her Cindy because
she had them all so we kept her name
Cindy and then a week later we went back
for another one and we ended up
getting there and we couldn't think of a
name for him but I was like we need to
have it as a base because we already
have Cindy she's see we need to have a
boy a name it be for Brett you know so
we came up with Bear and then a few
months later when we found Zoey he was
outside we found him at his dad's house
he was just like a little baby and he
was starving and he had sleeves and
everything we took him in and got him
all cleaned up and know he's in a great
home but we named him Bo and the reason
we named him Bo was because he was
bowlegged when he walks but also because
you know the boys are bees and the girls
are C's so I was like come on we need
one more and even in my closet I have
like CBBC like everywhere so I was like
Cindy and then in the order we got him
with Cindy bear Bo so I'm like CBB we
need another girl we were thinking of
names and we already had the name picked
out we just I mean had no real plan on
getting one any time soon but while we
were in I think it was Bali me my mom my
sister have a group chat on Instagram
where like we just send each other cute
cat videos we're like really annoying
cat ladies and she sent me one of this
adorable Scottish Fold Kitty which is
the one who's the little folded years
and she was just snuggling up on her
owner and it was literally the cutest
video I've ever seen so I did something
that I've done a million other time so
like what I do is when I see like a
really cute cat or a breed I'm always
like oh let me see if they have that
breeding new jersey so like typing in
never end up finding anything like I
must have done this about a hundred
times even before I even got Cindy and
bear I mean I was allergic to cat so I
never thought I would actually get one
but I used to just look up different
breeds in New Jersey and I found someone
who's not too far from where I actually
grew up so I went on her page and she
only had one baby laughs and it was shy
and she was the color of chai tea which
was like so meant to be and I just
thought she was literally the cutest
little girl ever so I messaged her we
were just going back and forth like
nothing was set in stone yet I was just
trying to get a little bit more info on
her and all of that and so we had talked
back in Bali and I hadn't heard from her
in a couple of days so didn't think
anything of it I told her I was in Asia
and I would be back soon and yada yada
yeah so we're sitting at that restaurant
in Singapore and we weren't even going
to go there but I had asked Leslie I was
like do you know is like it's not a rush
on top of that those buildings so she's
like yeah I'll get us a reservation so
we ended up there like a really nice
restaurant up there and the manager of
the restaurant came over to our table
and he just welcomed us for coming and
asked if we're celebrating anything in
general and Leslie so freaking cute I
literally I'm obsessed with her she was
like yes we are Carly raised all this
money for a scholarship and like just
started going on and like telling the
man of everything about like our trip
and everything which is so cute and from
there we just started talking a little
bit more he asked us where we were from
and me and Brett well we just said New
York because everywhere else when we
would say New Jersey people seemed a
little bit confused so we're like all
New York it's just easier people know
New York they don't really know New
Jersey sometimes so we said New York and
the guy was like oh I'm actually from
New Jersey so we're like oh we're
actually from New Jersey - what part and
he's from the same town that we live in
right now which is so weird like we are
halfway across the world 12 hour time
difference in a country we've never been
to before and in a restaurant on top of
like a huge building and the manager of
the restaurant is from the exact same
town literally two minutes from where we
live right now and he worked two minutes
from where we live right now so it was
just so weird and in that moment that he
was saying that where we all live what
are the chances I get a random text from
the test lady that we were talking to
and out of nowhere she told us that try
she liked it let me let you know chives
birthday what's the great 18th and she
just gave it a few other details and as
soon as I was reading that after like I
was listening about what was going on I
was like are you kidding me February
18th has special meaning to both me and
Brett and we're really big on dates and
all those things so Brett had an older
sister before he was born who
unfortunately passed away only a few
weeks after being born
I mean her birthday was February 18
turning lacera but what's so crazy about
that is if Sara didn't end up passing
why Brett would have never been here so
as horrible of a situation as that was
it was just like a date that was just
really special to us and February 18th
also has meaning to my family because my
aunt Karen had passed away on February
18th so
yes the two dates don't have the best
meaning but to me like numbers mean
everything and it was just like in that
moment after like so many different
things on that trip happened where like
it was just kind of like aha moments and
just like weird coincidences that when
she said that I was like oh my gosh so
this to me means that the baby is meant
to be like there's a reason that's her
birthday and that I found her and she's
a right she's the same colors as a named
chai that we wanted to name her after so
it just ended up working out perfectly
so we got her yesterday and literally I
am so obsessed she slept right here all
night with her paws right on my face and
the other babies never ever sleep like
they sleep with us but they lay on our
legs and very rarely cuddle up so the
fact that she just laid here all night
it was like the best night of my life
so I didn't really get much sleep but I
don't even care I woke up like with the
biggest smile on my face and yeah so I'm
gonna go get chai so you guys can meet
her the littlest dumplings this in my
hand I've pretty small hands and he's
just a babe my baby
oh god bless you the human got bear and
that's what I was saying I'm by the way
so bears in there and he's up there I
don't know I go in honey boo boo girl
can we say hi to my friend be ready
cool climbing up my legs in a little
rascal hey beautiful
so that was the story with chai she's
literally everything so I think we're
done for now with cats I know I'm
already a crazy cat lady and now we
added one more so I already warned
everyone with snapchat if you don't like
cats and you hated me before unfollow me
now because now I have four and she's a
baby and she keep standed so I'm going
to be showing a lot of her so what else
oh I also wanted to talk about my
pallets and a lot of you guys have
gotten it already which I've been so
happy to see you guys loving it and I
know they are still working on getting
orders out there was over 50,000 orders
and what happened was since the BH site
crashed and we had to move it over to
print out of you T V H had all the
shipping supplies and everything already
and the pallets and everything going to
them so what we had to do through
Pranava
is we had to print out all the labels on
our end and then bring them over to BH
and then B H how to package all of them
and ship them out so it wasn't like the
normal setup where it was through BH and
then they should shift it out right then
and there it's been taking a little bit
longer than expected but I think at this
point all of these domestic orders have
been shipped and I believe today is like
the last day that all of the
International shipping are going out so
my customer service team has been so
amazing they have answered every single
email so if you have any questions
problems concerns or your pellet arrives
broken or if anything happens that
you're not happy about please email info
@preneur beauty.com also make sure it's
not Pravana it's part Nava I know some
people who are saying that the email
didn't exist but it does you just have
to make sure you're spelling it
correctly also if you never receive the
email from them check your spam box a
lot of people were finding it in there
them now so again anyone having any
issues that is the easiest way to
contact them and they will 100% answer
you and help you out they are working
from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. LA time so
the West Coast time but they will be
getting back to every single person and
if you for whatever reason don't hear
back then you can go ahead and tweet me
and I've been helping some people that
way as well so every single person will
get their order it's just taking a
little bit longer than normal because of
all this and the pre-order and
everything like that so thank you guys
for being so patient and thank you for
everyone who ordered it I hope you guys
loved it as much as I do I can't wait to
start seeing you guys create some looks
with it and I feel like it's the perfect
palette for summer and I believe there's
only a few more days left of it being
1950 so definitely pick it up now and
then it's going up to 2250 which is not
a huge change but if you guys want to
get it for the discounted price I think
it's good until the end of April which
we have a few more days so I think that
is really all I wanted to cover again we
were traveling for like two weeks and
then last week we were so jet-lagged we
got home super late Monday night and I
think Tuesday I was fine but like
Wednesday Thursday Friday I was sleeping
all day it was like all kinds of crazy
we were up all night and sleeping all
day
so finally back to myself and now we
have a new baby so it's been throwing me
off a little bit more but I promise I
will be filming new makeup videos this
week and then next week will be my
normal filming schedule and I will be
back at it because I'm not going
anywhere for a while so thank you guys
so much for watching I figured I would
just do a little story video until you
guys about what's been going on since I
have been mi for quite some time and
again I'm filming tomorrow and new
videos so let me know what you guys want
to see if you want to see a makeup look
with my new palette I can 100% do that
for you guys or if you want to something
different let me know so I love you guys
so much thank you for watching and until
next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
