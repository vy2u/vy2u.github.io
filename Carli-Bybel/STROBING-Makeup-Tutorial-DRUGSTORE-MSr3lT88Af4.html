today's video I'm going to show you how
to strobe your face with all drugstore
products it has been the newest trend
that I've literally seen in every
magazine people are tweeting about it
everyone is saying it's the new contour
and that contours it out and strobing is
in it's funny because a lot of people
who have done makeup or wear makeup
artists know that it's just really
highlighting with a new name so I
figured I would show you guys how to
strobe your face with all drugstore
products that way if you guys want to
try it out you can go buy some products
that are affordable and see how you like
it before you go and spurge on maybe
some higher-end products so this is the
look right here you can see it's just
super duly I'm just super highlighted I
have no contour on my face I did contour
my nose because I can't go a day without
contouring my nose but other than that
there are no bronzers no contour no
nothing on my face so if you guys want
to learn how I got this look right here
and some techniques on strobing please
keep watching so to start this lick off
I'm using my Lumina illuminating BB
cream along with this new L'Oreal liquid
glow illuminator I just picked this one
up at the drugstore I'm going to be
mixing them together on the back of my
hand so it's so funny because the
strobing quote-unquote show bang trend
is like in every Beauty magazine on
every website it's saying it's like
gonna take over contouring and I mean it
may but my opinion I'll always contour I
feel like every day I perfect how to
contour and when you do know how to do
it right for your face shape I don't
know I just feel like that's a trend
that will never go out of style in my
opinion but will so
strobing for those of you who don't know
which I'm sure most of you have looked
it up because it seems to be the newest
thing it's basically you're just
highlighting everywhere it's basically
you're just highlighting the high points
of your face I figured I would do this
video is like a talk through is like a
chitchat because like it's been a while
since I've done one so next I'm applying
my Maybelline concealer this one is my
favorite from the drugstore I was
actually um kind of grossed out because
I was like wait I think I should
probably buy a new one of these it might
be like 2 years old
I actually cleaned it and I used some
alcohol on it but um I think it's time
for anyway so I'm just applying my
concealer where I normally would if I
were contouring so with my damp Beauty
Blender I'm going to start blending all
that in so one thing I am going to do in
this video which I'll cut it out because
it has it doesn't have to do with the
trend um I will be contouring my nose so
some people I think most people probably
didn't and they're strobing tutorials
but you guys know I can't like go a day
without contouring my nose
I did most of my eye makeup as well the
lashes that I'm wearing are the design
your own lash with the lower lashes um
I'll link you guys the site and I'll let
you know exactly which different options
I picked for this lash it's opal you can
go on and kind of pick your own lash
depending on what you're looking for so
pretty cool right before I forget I'm
just taking a little more of this BB
cream and I'm just gonna apply it on my
neck when I went into the bathroom to
watch my Beauty Blender the lighting was
a little different and I notice that
it's it's be blended a little bit
ourselves don't ever forget to do your
neck you don't need to put the
illuminator on your neck I could do the
separate like what I'm doing and just
apply the BB cream next with the same
highlighter that I had previously used
I'm taking some of my fingers and I'm
going to start applying it on my cheeks
before we do any powder I'm going to do
all the liquids and I'm just applying
this on the high points of my cheekbones
I'm dabbing it up around my brow just do
a light tapping motion and you can go
back with the Beauty Blender this is
such a good color highlight though I
found that I snapchat it for you guys
and it's actually really really good
it's such a nice color I've never seen a
gold like this at the drugstore so when
I saw it I had to get it up but I'm also
applying this on my nose a little bit on
my forehead like right here on my chin
just look a little bit on here and then
I'm just grabbing this again I'm just
gonna
so now we need to set our concealer so
it doesn't end up creasing so we're
going to add a little bit of powder
underneath the eyes to set it so it's
going to mattify it a little bit but
then we're going to go over with a
powder highlighter anyway so don't worry
about that it's not going to ruin the
look
so one day said earlier I'm just gonna
contour my nose not anywhere else on my
face just because I like how my nose
looks contoured better so I'm using the
la girl pro conceal and I'm going to
come to my nose for blush I'm using this
one by NYX it's called Hamptons these
NYX blushes I just recently got these I
think from Ulta you're so pigmented you
could pull me a little bit at a time
because you could see I only dipped it
in like once and look up much came out
okay so now moving on to the powder
highlighter this one is mary-lou manizer
this is definitely the most pigmented
bang for your buck drugstore highlighter
that you can get I actually also
recently picked up this new one by
L'Oreal and i swatched it and if I want
to go return it it's honestly horrible
so I don't recommend this it looks
really pretty I bought it in two colors
and yeah it's just like a bunch of
sparkles it's not even like a
highlighter so well ditch that one we'll
stick with the mary-lou manizer since
she is the one that is the best in my
opinion and I'm going to apply that on
all the places that I applied the liquid
highlighter I also wanted to mention I
saw a lot of people asking for some
makeup tutorials from a couple other of
my post recently and I'm working on
something really special and I've been
working on it for about a year now and
it's almost time to announce it so stay
tuned for that but okay so highlight
we're going to put it back on the high
points of our cheek
both the brow
little under the brow close my finger
for that
on the bridge of the news I also put it
right here so it looks cool and then a
little on the chin I just picked up
these new lip pencils um the brand is
sharp gotta I think is it Eva Mendes
who's the face of it
um I haven't tried these yet obviously I
can't even open them but I was a little
disappointed only because when I got up
to pay didn't even notice that these lip
pencils were all ten dollars each but
ten dollars for a drugstore lip pencil I
would probably stick with my Jordana
which is a dollar ninety-nine if you
guys are on a budget but I figured I
would try out something new so this one
is in the color nude kinda just looks
like a lip color
yeah okay so it's not worth the $10 it's
I like my Jordana better so I'm just
gonna grab her and tawny it's more
pigmented and it's a lot cheaper
I'm gonna take a little more I keep it
though
sorry I was trying to do something and
talking to some time so it highlights it
more and then I'm also gonna highlight
or in the center of my lip so this is a
trick tank your lips look bigger maybe I
shouldn't be doing this because they're
big enough but just one day give you
guys that little tip and then for
lipgloss I'm using my Revlon a12 peony
peony and it's like a pretty shimmery
color so just going to add one more step
because I think it'll really make this
lip pop I'm gonna take a little bit more
of that mary-lou manizer and I'm just
gonna apply it on my eyelids just so
it's like extra highlighted looking
extra strobe as they want to call it
which it's funny because so many people
are saying it and something I thought
about too is that I mean it's just
highlighting they just added a new name
to chime create a new trend but I feel
like people have been doing this forever
in the summertime especially like I
would always stick with a highlighter
and kind of ditch the bronzer but let's
just go with that it's a new trend oh
also we're applying this in tear duct
and then our final step is to use the
NYX dewy finish setting spray this is
going to also help give you that really
dewy look and it's going to help set
your makeup
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video hopefully you
learn something new and maybe found some
new products that you want to go out and
try I love you guys so much thank you
for watching and until next time I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
