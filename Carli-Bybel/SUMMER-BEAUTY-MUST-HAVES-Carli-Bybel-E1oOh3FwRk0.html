today's video I'm going to talk about
some of my must-have beauty products for
the summertime some of the products I
don't think I've mentioned before and
videos while others I probably mentioned
the past couple of years that I've been
on YouTube but I have a group of
products that I tend to use a ton of for
the warmer weather so if you guys want
to hear some of the products please keep
watching so first I want to talk about
some lotions that I love what I love the
most about the summertime is making your
skin look nice and sunkissed and sparkly
and shimmery and glowy and I actually
just recently posted a blog post and I
saw a couple people comment asking if I
had just freshly waxed my legs like how
do I get my legs look so shiny and
photoshopped and it's actually the
product called body bling by Scott
Barnes I'm usually so much tanner at
this point um I have not laid out just
like took a day off and laid out in the
Sun in over a year so I definitely need
to just soak up the Sun a little bit and
get some color but what I use the other
day for my blog post was actually the
platinum body bling so I'm going to show
you guys swatches after I mentioned each
product you could see the colors of each
of them depending on your skin tone what
you would prefer when I'm Taylor
I like the Platinum one because it has
more of like a rose gold peachy
undertone as opposed to the original
which is more bronze and it's going to
give you a darker shade of bronze this
product is actually what Beyonce uses so
if you see her on the red carpet always
looking so shimmery this is what she
uses so I started using these probably
like six months ago and they're
incredible they're just amazing and I've
had products similar to these that were
the exact same idea but these are
definitely my favorites so I love the
original and the platinum again I will
swatch them so if you guys want to see
the difference so you don't need to go
out and buy both depending on what
you're looking for I also have a third
one this one is by Kiko and it's called
body skin glow and this one is more of
just a
or lotion it doesn't have a color in it
so this is actually what I'm wearing
right now it's just more like a white
champagne shimmer and I don't know if
you can really tell but it just gives
you a really pretty glow and when the
Sun is listening on you you're literally
going to look like you're glistening so
some people may not like that look but
for me it's like one of my favorite
parts of summer is just glistening I
just think it really adds that summer
glow so these three are incredible
the next product you can find right at
your drugstore I've been using this
product for ever and they come in like a
canned version and then the lotion
version I like to mix in the lotion with
a normal lotion and then just apply it
on my body it's instant leg it says it's
for your legs but I use it everywhere
besides my face it's going to give you
some instant color so if you guys don't
want to use a self-tanner you don't want
to wait like six to eight hours you
could just put this on it's going to
instantly give you a really nice tan so
this is in the color deep I think it's
the darkest one that it comes in and you
can just use this alone or like what I
do you can mix it in with your regular
moisturizer and it's gonna give you a
really pretty glow so if you guys don't
want to spend a couple hours out in the
Sun yet you still want to look some
kissed this stuff is amazing and you can
get it from the drugstore so I had to
include that and then the next product
is by jargons it's the shade Beauty oil
and I love beauty oil now the ones that
I'm showing you I'm sure there's a
million other brands that do the exact
same thing so it's all about preference
this is just the one that I've been
using um if I'm ever wearing like a
skirt I will apply this on my legs
because not only will I apply the body
bling or the shimmer lotion but if you
put that on top of it it's just going to
make your legs look shiny and glistening
and it's just going to give you a
beautiful glow you can also use this if
you are going to the beach or if you're
in a bathing suit and you just want your
skin to look really healthy and dewy and
yeah so this body oil is incredible I'm
obsessed with it also I wanted to add
that it's not greasy so it's not going
to like get all over your clothes it
kind of just seeps into your skin and
gives you that really dewy finish so
these lotions are definitely my top
favorites obviously you guys don't need
to go out and buy every single one but
if there's like a certain thing that
you're looking for these ones I
definitely back up so one thing that's
super annoying and something that I find
super annoying is throughout the year
your skin tone is going to change
whether it's winter and you're not
seeing the Sun or it's all of a sudden
summer and your skin is ending a lot
darker so instead of going out and
buying every single color foundation
which I have like three colors of all my
favorite foundations because I'm just
all over the place as far as skin tones
one thing that I've used for over a year
now and that's literally a life saver is
the million dollar tan shade upgrade you
mix this in with your found
it's going to darken your foundation
like a bunch of shades depending on how
much you put in it so say you have like
a really light foundation you put a
couple pumps of this it's going to give
it that bronze II like beautiful tan
color it's not going to make it look
like a she or anything like that so this
stuff is amazing mix it in with your
foundation if you want to use it alone
to just kind of apply on your face if
you want it to match your body this
sounds great I recommend it I also have
a 15 percent off coupon code for this
product one thing to keep in mind if
you're using the Sally Hansen airbrush
lights or the regular original body
bling it's gonna give your skin a darker
tan look so you want your face to match
your body so if you don't want to buy a
dark dark foundation buy this mix it in
with your foundation and you're good to
go and I think it's definitely a
must-have for summer especially for
those that like to bake in the Sun get a
nice tan next up I have my Mario Badescu
rose water and it's almost empty I
actually already bought a new one to
replace it I absolutely love this spray
it's nice to just keep in your purse and
if you're ever getting too hot or if you
just feel like you need moisture on your
face you just spray it all over and it
smells delicious you feel so refreshed
and there's a couple products out there
that are basically the same idea mac
fix+
the mary o Badescu um there's also the
Evian water spray basically they're all
the same ideas just to kind of refresh
your face make you feel nice and
moisturized so I like to keep this with
me at all times if I'm going to the pool
keep it with you if you get too hot just
spray it and it's literally a lifesaver
I recommend investing in some sort of
vitamin spray whether it be this one I
think this one's only like $7 um and yet
a couple others that I recommended I
just love having these with me it when
it's super hot out because there's
nothing worse than dying of heat and
feeling so dry and yes so this is
something I keep with me at all times I
used to use the Evian water spray a lot
more but once I found this this has been
like my number one favorite the next
product is literally my absolute
favorite this has been my fifth or sixth
one of these that I've gone through I
also went through like the big jars they
come in it's the first day Beauty ultra
Repair Cream and I think I mentioned
this in a favorites video a few months
back but it was what I was first trying
it out so I wasn't sure how
which I was liking it and this has
helped my eczema immensely like it's a
I'm never itchy anymore my legs every
single night I'd wake up bitch Inge and
making myself bleed and this stuff has
just been seriously a lifesaver so if
any of you guys are looking for a good
lotion that's gonna really moisturize
and it's good for really dry skin this
first day beauty is my favorite so like
I said I think I've went through like
four of these and then like the big jars
so I need more of them gotta order some
more but this stuff is incredible I do
believe they do have one with SPF so if
you guys are looking for something
that's going to protect you from the Sun
and moisturize again they definitely
have one similar one that has that but
this stuff I use right as I get out of
the shower and it's helped my skin so
much next I have a SPF 30 sunscreen
lotion you guys need to be protecting
yourself in the Sun this is something
that you guys need to be using whether
it be this brand whether it be the many
other brands on the market you need an
SPF 30
at least lotion while you're out in the
Sun and this is something that I've
known about forever and when I tell you
I ignored it my whole life
I would use baby oil I would literally
lay out in the Sun for hours and just
bake and never put any SPF on because my
skin tone doesn't really burn it just
gets really really tan so I was just
like baking in the Sun and I've never
asked Piaf we'd go away and I just
wouldn't ever care and then I started
reading into it and I realized how bad
the tanning beds were and how bad it is
if you're not wearing SPF so I'm sure
some of you guys may listen to this part
be like oh I don't need SPF I'm fine
that's fine that's the way you want to
live all the power to you but for my
girls out there that want to protect
your skin and you want to prevent any
diseases or anything bad happening use
SPF 30 so there's a million brands you
can use something with at least 30
slathered all over your body and then go
out in the Sun and don't worry you'll
still get tan it just might take a
little bit longer but it's so important
to protect your skin and there's one
piece of advice that you guys can take
from me from this video use the SPF so
this is the one that I've been using
currently I love the color of the bottle
it's so pretty and yeah next up I have
some lip balms I guess this is kind of
an obvious thing but when
superhot at my lips are always chapped
so I always have some sort of chapstick
in my purse
the favorites I have I couldn't find my
agave lip mass which it's by a bite I
think I talked about it in a few videos
secondly in one of my purses somewhere I
just can't find it so I loved that one I
love the first aid beauty ultra Repair
lip therapy I also love the dr. jar dark
dr. jart um I don't even know how to
pronounce this sarah middens ceramide
ceramide lip care I don't know but this
stuff's really good and I also love
these NYX butter lip balms they're a
little bit tinted this one I use all the
time when I use whirl lip liner because
I was just a really pretty tint to it so
it doesn't matter again with the brands
to a lot of things I'm saying I'm just
giving you guys ideas as to what you
will need for the summer months and
chopstick is super important especially
getting on with some SPF in it if you're
out on the Sun because there's nothing
worse than when you burn your lips so
protect your lips protect your skin
protect your face and you'll be set
another product that I recommend for my
oily ladies out there our blotting
sheets this one is by Neutrogena and
they're long lasting blotting sheets and
these are something that I would just
throw in my purse and keep with me you
guys are really oily or if you're
sweating a lot and you don't want to
ruin your makeup keep these in your
purse and just blot them on your face
and it'll get rid of any excess oil and
it'll keep your makeup in place so these
I've been using since I was in high
school I would always keep these with me
because just sitting around with makeup
on all day you get really oily so it's
inevitable but these really helped and I
recommend them again there's a million
brands depending on which ones you like
this is just the one that I prefer so
now moving on to hair the first product
I've been using forever and I am in love
with it it's the bumble and bumble surf
spray this I'd like to apply my hair to
give it that beachy wave look and I
literally love this ever since I got my
keratin treatment if I just sleep with
my hair and a braid and then wake up and
spray this I literally have like perfect
beachy waves and it's incredible so this
stuff it's going to give you some
texture it's gonna make it like kind of
frizzy look at not frizzy but it's going
to give you that like just out of the
beach fresh look so I love the sea salt
spray I know I'm not supposed to use it
because when you get a
treatment they say the salt strips your
hair but I just use a little bit I don't
go crazy and I don't use it everyday but
this stuff is great also if you guys are
going to the beach and you want to get
those beachy waves you could throw it in
your beach bag spray it in your hair
once you're out of the water and if you
have the right type of hair it'll look
super nice so I love this stuff next I
have my argan oil this one's almost
empty it's the GK one again you guys
have seen my other haircare videos I
only use the GK products because I got
the GK keratin so I just like to use as
much curtin infused products as I can
but any type of argan oil would be great
it's great for the ends of your hair
because our hair gets super dry in the
warmer months what I always like to do
is apply it on the ends of my hair and
then I just oops and then I just end up
wiping it like on my skin just because
it feels so nice and I'm just obsessed
with this stuff I've tried a million
brands and they're all really good just
make sure it's an argan oil and yeah
that's one of my all-time favorites you
could tell I use this almost every day
as soon as I get out of all ways apply
it on my ends just because I like
refused to give myself a haircut because
my hair is getting so long but the argan
oil really helps seal the ends and just
keep your hair looking super fresh so
this stuff I use all the time in the
summer and then I have one last product
for you guys this I actually picked up
when I was in LA my friend Haru SH
swears by the stuff and I used it once
when I curled my hair and I loved how it
worked it's basically like a texture
spray so it's called triple sec
three-in-one texturizers amplifies and
refreshes it's my dry bar and this is
like a little sample size that i got it
Sephora it's just really great to apply
to your hair if you're doing big waves
or big curls it's just going to add
texture so for me like when I got my
care and treatment my hair's so much
smoother when I blow it out and there's
not a lot of texture and it's a little
bit flat so when I spray this in it just
kind of makes it just like super big and
super textured looking and for the
summertime I think that's what everyone
wants not all the time of course we like
that silky look but sometimes that
really big textured look is just in and
it looks effortless and I just love this
stuff so they have the sample sizes if
you guys want to try it before you buy
the big version of it so
recommend as that and yeah I think
that's really it I know there was a lot
of products but I figured I wanted to go
through a bunch of different ones
because I'm sure some of you guys may be
looking for certain items while others
are looking for different type of items
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
