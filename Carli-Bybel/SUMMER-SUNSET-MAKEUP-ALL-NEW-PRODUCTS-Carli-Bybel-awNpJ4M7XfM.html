today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here so I
sat down thinking I was going to film
like some super bright summery look and
ended up being a little bit darker then
expected but I really really loved how
it came out I tried a bunch of awesome
new products that are just on the market
so if you guys want to see how I got
this lip right here then please keep
watching for my eyes today I'm using the
new Jaclyn hill and morphe palette I'm
picking up the colors chip and Jax and
I'm mixing them together on my eyelid I
didn't need to dip my brush into setting
spray or anything like that the colors
are super pigmented and as you guys can
see I'm not wearing an eyeshadow primer
I really never do sometimes I'll just
apply some concealer when I'm applying
my base and that will double as my
eyeshadow primer so originally when I
wanted to do today's look I wanted to do
like brighter colors but for some reason
I was just drawn to like these
cranberries so that's what I decided to
do so I just wanted to say
congratulations to jacqueline hill and
morphe I really love the palette so far
I think you guys did a great job with
this so I wanted to keep the eyeshadow
in normal speed that way you guys can
really follow along and see how the
shadows are performing so I really did
like them I've seen a lot of mixed
reviews but I have had no problems
whatsoever especially with this look I
use a lot of matte shades and usually
the matte shades are a little bit more
chalky or less pigmented and other
brands but I think that it works
beautifully so I'm just using a small
smudge flash blending brush and I'm just
going to start blending that up into my
crease
next I'm picking up the color hunts with
a blending brush and I'm just slowly
blending that into my crease and into
the cranberry shade and then I'm just
grabbing a larger blending brush with
nothing on it and I'm just going to make
sure it's all blended nicely next I'm
picking up the color beam and also pool
party and I'm going to do like a light
seal in the crease of my eye so first
I'm applying the champagne color and
then I'm just applying a little bit of
that turquoise to give it a lighter
turquoise pop of color it's been a long
time since I've done like a color in my
tear duct but I actually did my cousin's
makeup for a wedding over the weekend
and I use like a bright yellow and it
looks so pretty so that was what kind of
inspired me to get a little color into
the tear duct today and I really love
how these colors look together it
reminds me of like a summer sunset maybe
if I was like in Hawaii but I don't know
it just gave me like summer sunset vibes
for eyeliner I'm using this one by
Physicians Formula it has like a serum
in it it's just super black and it makes
applying liner super easy and I'm not
going to do a wing or anything for
today's look but whenever I apply lashes
I always need some sort of line because
otherwise my eyes look uneven or I just
don't like how to look so some of you
guys may be wondering where my nails are
they didn't even last like two weeks my
eczema my hand has been pretty bad the
past couple of months and it's really
the only spot that hasn't cleared up so
I decided to give my nails a little bit
of a break and hope that the eggs must
clear so back to the tutorial I'm going
to go over all of the colors one more
time just to make sure it really really
stands out and also to make sure
everything's blended nicely and I know
right now the end of my eyeliner does
not look that cute but guess what when
there's no wing and you're looking
straight ahead and you're not zoomed in
this much you don't even see it next
we're going in with mascara and then we
are going to be applying the same to
cranberry shades on the lower lash line
so far as I'm using just like a small
angled brush and then I'm going to
slowly drag it down to give it a more
smoky look and then I'm grabbing this
same blending brush with that orange
shade
and I'm applying it right underneath the
cranberry so give it a really smoky
effect then I'm going in with some
powder under my lashes so I don't ruin
this look and I'm applying some bottom
mascara so bronze up my face I'm coming
off the new skinny dip highlighter and
bronzer from the Kylie vacations
collection the brow notes a little light
but we'll see how it does
really pretty
it's a really really pretty formula I
don't know if it came in two colors I
only got this one but I think it's a
little bit light so I'm just going to go
in a little bit with my cat Bundy just
so my face is closer to my body so this
is the one that I always use it just
seems really the best color for my
skintone but it actually really likes a
formula of the kylie one we went on
really nicely so if you guys have
lighter complexion I think this one
would work for you this is the sunkissed
and blow-up dual Tala next I'm going to
go in with lips I think this is the
color I'm going to use I'm using the OG
Lolita cap on the lipliner so I haven't
tried these yet ever since I got the
whole package so I'm really excited to
try this
they're really really creamy which I
like the own thing with lip liners is I
prefer the ones that you could sharpen
because they get really really sharp and
easier to apply but these are really
nice as well now their lines I'm going
in with calabasas liquid lipstick from
jeffree star cosmetics
I'm going to go in with a mute on top of
it called honky this color is beautiful
but I'd like with this I look it's a
little bit too pink
for blush I'm using peepshow by NARS
I've never used this color before but I
feel like it kind of goes with the theme
that I'm going with and I love these two
colors mixed together like a safe color
for me but I just love these two mixed
it's not really pretty so I'm gonna take
a little bit on my brush
and then to highlight I'm going to mix
two so I'm going to try out the jeffree
star and mani collab and be color a clip
and use this one first and I've been
dying to try this one as well since the
kylie jenner BG loose like a pigmented
highlighter so I'm going to do both them
and mix it up and I'm going to go super
glowy today because why not
and a little on here as well and then
we're going to highlight the cheeks
so pretty love it like an icy champagne
color
very pretty
now I don't even need another
highlighter but the person I'm wearing
makeup in a couple days now so I'm going
to double it up for fun so I'm just
taking what's ever left on the cap I had
watched these on my snapchat so I
already opened it and I'm going to apply
that right over it
into that
hello Wow looks really insane
so I'm going to show you right now one
of the reasons why I don't like to wear
too much highlighter because you see
when I'm looking straight at you it kind
of looks like dark right here and right
here even though it's highlighted we get
that problem so what I want to do is I'm
just going to kind of like tap it out a
little bit right here we're going to go
all out so I'm going to think a little
bit more
and I'm going to use a tiny bit of that
on my nose as well that's my favorite
literally get to it
like I don't you guys can see how good
this really is well I put this all on my
body
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I absolutely
loved all the new products that I tried
in today's video I'm obsessed with how
the eyes came out the highlighters are
amazing I love the lipstick so I'm
really excited I tried a bunch of new
products out because when I find a
routine that works I tend to stick with
it but I couldn't wait to try some of
these new products for summer so I hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial I love
you guys so much and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
