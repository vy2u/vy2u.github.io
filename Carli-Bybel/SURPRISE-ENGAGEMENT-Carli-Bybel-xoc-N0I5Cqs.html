Nicole and I don't know which stickers
I'm going to use but I'm thinking maybe
these right on here and then I got like
a sheet of paper and I'm going to put
like some stickers on it and it's right
here like a little card so for this I'm
thinking about putting that sticker up
there I'm going to use these for sure
I'm thinking maybe this little flower on
the bottom and then I'm just going to
write her a little something in the
middle guys done I'm going to take that
little edge off of it but I wanted to
bring some decorations because we're
going to be hanging out there all day so
good morning so today is a very very
special day I have not been able to talk
about it and it did holds me up this
week because I had a lot to do once I
get this log up hopefully you guys will
understand but today my best friend is
getting engaged
I'm so excited so it is currently 7:45
in the morning we just left the house
we're just grabbing Starbucks really
quick obviously and then we were heading
down to Atlantic City so her boyfriend
future fiance came over a couple weeks

plan so we are going there now we're
going to check in and then around my
12:30 1:00 o'clock we're going to go
surprise her
there's no idea that we're coming and
his 30th birthday was on Tuesday so they
think they're going down there to
celebrate his birthday and we were
originally supposed to go but I told her
that I wasn't able to make it because we
had something to do in the city or
whatever so the plan is we're going to
get to the pool where they're hanging
out and we're going to like sneak in
behind our socials and see us and then
we're going to be like hello we're here
so she looks at us and she's like wait
why what are you guys doing here and
then she'll turn around and he'll be on
one knee so I have like all my camera
equipment I got my underwater GoPro

gonna like pick her up and they're gonna
jump in the pool together so I'm gonna
like hand him the GoPro really quickly
