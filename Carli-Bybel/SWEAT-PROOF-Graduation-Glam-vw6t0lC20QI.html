hi everybody thank you for watching in
today's video I'm going to show you how
I got this heat proof sweat proof fresh
look for graduation I remember back when
I was graduating high school it was
deadly hot outside and I wish I would
have had a routine like this to follow
because I don't know anything about
sweat proof makeup but I have some
really great staple products that can
help keep your makeup on through these
really hot days and to look great
through graduation
so I also wanted to mention for my
lovers out in London I'm coming to
beautycon next weekend and I'm flying
out Wednesday and I am so excited to
come to Europe it's my first time there
I will be going with stylehaul and I
will be at their booth if they have a
booth I'm pretty sure that they do so I
will let you guys know as far as what
time I'm going to be there but I'm so
excited to meet some of you guys so if
you are in London and you're attending I
will see you there if you are in London
and you're not attending I will link
below where you can buy tickets because
I don't know when I'll get to get back
to London and I would love to meet some
of you guys so if you guys want to learn
how i got this makeup look please keep
watching to start off this look and
basically any makeup look I always love
using my Smashbox primer I swear when I
don't use it I feel like my pores show
through my foundation instantly so next
I'm using the new Mac Pro Longwear what
a proof foundation and I'm actually in
love with this stuff it's really really
lightweight on the skin and it really
does last I wore it the past couple of
days and I also wore it into the shower
just to really test it out and it's
waterproof guys it's crazy so I'm mixing
and c30 and NC 35 the colors are
definitely a lot different than the
foundation so I would recommend going in
testing out the swatches before you buy
because I couldn't find my exact shade I
had to buy two to mix it together so I
really do like it though and I do
approve of it and recommend it for
anyone who's looking for a good
foundation first I'm just blending it in
with my Beauty Blender and then I'm
taking this foundation brush to really
buff it
and just make it have the thinnest layer
possible since it is super warm out and
we want this to look really glamorous
but yet stay on through the heat
I recommend buffing it out because it's
gonna just thin out the foundation it's
not gonna leave it Kiki at all and it's
still gonna give you that beautiful
coverage now for concealer this one is
also waterproof this is by Lancome and
I've used this probably about four times
and I really like it because it's very
very thin some of the concealers that I
use such as the NARS creamy concealer
it's a thicker consistency and it goes
on thicker this gives you just enough
coverage and it blends super easy and it
doesn't leave your skin feeling really
heavy or cakey so again this is why I
chose to use this for this look and if
you guys have really dark circles I
don't know how well this concealer will
work for you but mine are pretty blue
lately and it covers just fine so I'm
okay with just using this once in
concealer then to set the concealer I'm
using my Laura Mercier setting powder
some of you guys may be thinking well if
it's hot out why the heck do I want all
these layers but this is for when we
want to look a little bit more glamorous
such as for graduation but yet we still
have to withstand the heat so I've
tested out this full face routine and I
promise you it does last the best that
it could out of any other versions that
I've tried or all over my lids I applied
the Mac Naked pigment and in my crease
I'm using this new palette by the balm
cosmetics I'm mixing this pink and this
brown color together to give it a really
pretty crease color which I'm using with
a big fluffy blending brush then with a
smaller tapered blending brush and this
darker brown color I'm applying this
right into the crease of my eye and I'm
drawing the outer V as well and I'm just
going to accentuate that a little bit
more with my pencil brush and that same
shade and since I'm not doing liner for
this look I like to really accentuate my
eyes because it makes them look a lot
bigger for lashes i'm using the whispies
by Ardell but i'm also using the cluster
holics which are the individuals by the
lower lashes and i applied a couple of
those on the edge just to give it a
little bit more of a wispy dramatic look
to set my eyebrows which i did before
this makeup
look I'm using model in a bottle it's
eyebrow sealer now to contour my nose
and my face I'm using the Kat Von D
shade and light palette I'm taking this
grey hour tone shout out first and I'm
contouring my nose with this Sigma
tapered blending brush the same one that
I used that my eyes actually just wiped
it off in between then with a brush that
has a little bit of translucent powder I
am just blending in the sides of my nose
then I'm grabbing the warmer tone
contour shade in the same palette and
I'm bronzing up my cheeks normally at
this time of year I'm a lot tanner I
just have not seen the Sun at all so if
I was a little tanner I would recommend
maybe using a little bit less bronzer
than I'm using here in this look but
again if you want to give yourself that
nice bronzed look a little powder isn't
going to hurt you from that same palette
by the balm I'm grabbing this pink color
blush and I'm applying that on the
apples of my cheeks and this is just
going to add some color into my face
then I'm grabbing the makeup geek shadow
and the color in the spotlight and such
a gorgeous shade it's a little bit of a
peach tone and I'm applying that
underneath my lower lash line also in my
tear duct then I'm applying my mascara
on my lower lash line moving on to lips
I am using Mac oak liner which is one of
my all-time favorites I wanted to do a
peach colored lip for this so I'm using
sushi kiss by Mac and then over that I'm
using the new lip gloss by Gerard
cosmetics in the color candy kiss and it
is stunning I'm obsessed with it it's a
light peach color and I think this is a
must-have for summertime so I am then
taking the highlighter that also comes
in that palette and I am just
highlighting my cheeks this part is
optional of course if you don't want to
apply it because you think you're going
to be shiny because this would be that
hot skip this step but if you guys want
that extra shine and
and I should be good to go so I
completely forgot to show this part but
I would recommend adding in a setting
spray just to keep everything locked in
and yeah that is it for the final look
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this makeup look if you
guys are graduating this year I wanted
to wish you the best of luck in the next
chapter of your life and congratulations
because this is a huge time in your life
we should feel very very proud of
yourself so I hope you guys enjoyed I
love you so much
and until next time I'll see you guys
later and I tested it out to make sure
you get it you'll mess up the flow mmm
thank you so much my girls the best bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
