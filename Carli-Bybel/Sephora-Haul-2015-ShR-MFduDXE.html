in today's video I'm going to be doing a
Sephora haul lately I've been doing a
bunch of online shopping I haven't
actually been in the store so I'm gonna
take you guys through the last two trips
that I had online so to say I have a
bunch of products some of them I
actually already got to try out and some
of them are amazing at my new favorite
so if you guys want to see when it
picked up from Sephora please keep
watching so the first product that I
wanted to talk about is one of my
favorites at the moment you can see I
just got up two weeks ago and it's
already losing some of its liquid this
is the Mario Badescu skincare facial
spray and it has aloe herbs and
rosewater this product is so amazing it
smells so delicious and it's great to
use on your face to give it some
moisture to just kind of refresh
everything you can use it as a makeup
setting spray there's really a million
uses for it what I've been using it for
is after I apply my foundation I'll
spray it all for my face to just make my
face feel nice and moisturize and then
I'll also use to set my makeup if you
guys are doing a more dramatic look I
would maybe recommend a heavier setting
spray that way it can really lock it in
place but this is great even if you're
not wearing makeup just just to add some
moisture into your skin so I'm loving
this right now it's definitely one of my
favorites and I believe it's only six
dollars which is amazing so I'm
absolutely loving this right now the
next product that I picked up was the
new Becca limited-edition rose gold
I smell fantastic on it what is this
called it's called the blushed copper
and it's one of their mineralized
powders normally I'm obsessed this color
is very pigmented and it's very coppery
so I don't really know what you can use
it for I guess maybe more of like a
bronzer or a blush because as a
highlighter it kind
just adds like a copper finish to it so
it doesn't really look good as a
highlight I only tried it once so I'm
sure you can really use a million
different things to write but the reason
that I had to get it was because it was
in this rose gold casing I absolutely
love anything rose gold I think it's one
of my favorite colors so again I don't
know how fond I am of this backup powder
I only tried it once so we'll see if it
grows on me but I will definitely keep
you guys updated because sometimes
companies pay extra money for the
awesome casing to really sell people on
the product and the product might not be
as good so kind of on the fence about
this one but it is super pretty
the next product that I picked up is my
makeup forever it's the pro sculpting
duo in the color Oh - maybe I don't know
I don't know what color this is but I'll
link it for you guys this one I also
tried out I use the gold shade and this
gold shade is basically a dupe to Mac
whisper guilt also Estee Lauder heatwave
so if any of you guys missed those
products this product is awesome it's a
great highlighter I haven't used the
brown shade in it it says it's for eye
contour shade it's a little orange e in
my opinion so I haven't tried that side
out yet but i swatched it in it again it
looks kind of orange so I don't care I
love the gold that's why I picked out
this one I believe it also comes in like
a Pinker shade so depending on what
color highlighter you want this one is
amazing also if you wet your brush a
little bit what i've been using the rose
water for also which i complete forgot
is when I apply my highlight I use my
fan brush and if you use a powder
sometimes it doesn't come out as
pigmented so if you just spritz your
little fan brush and get it a little
damp and then dip it into the
highlighter watch how much more
pigmented the powder is going to come
out it's literally a night and day so
another amazing reason to get this spray
it's gonna really bring out the powders
it's gonna bring out the pigment of your
eyeshadows basically anything so that's
why I'm loving that if you guys don't
want to go out and get it again it was
only six dollars um another thing that
I've used in the past is mac fix+ which
is a little bit more pricey but you can
also use eye drops or even water
anything that's going to get your brush
a little bit wet it's gonna really help
the pigments of the shadow so this one
is Mac whisper of guilt and this is the
makeup forever the next product that I
picked up is by Lancome and it's the
waterproof long-lasting under-eye
concealer I have not tried this yet but
I figured with spring and summer around
the corner
waterproof concealer like I wonder if it
really works I wonder if it's actually
really waterproof because imagine just
putting a little concealer on jumping in
the pool coming out and it'll still be
on I mean I've never heard of such a
thing but we shall see when I do try
this out for you guys I will test it out
and maybe in the shower or something and
I'll let you guys know how it is before
you go out and buy it so again some of
these products I haven't tried yet but
they're just once I recently picked up
so I'll be trying them all out for you
guys the next product is by Kevin O Quan
and it's the celestial skin liquid
lightening and I use this one as well I
mixed it in with my foundation it's like
a shimmery it's like a shimmery what
would you call this shimmery I don't
even know like a cream almost it's like
skintone color but it has a very
shimmery finish it's very similar to the
Gerard BB plus illumination which is the
same basically the same consistency this
one is a little bit pricey so I mean
there aren't other products that I've
tried that work just as well that aren't
as pricey so you guys won I could put
cheaper alternatives down below but I
actually really loved it but I don't
think it's a must-have must buy but it
is really pretty
the next product I finally got my hands
on it is the Estee Lauder Illuminations
face powder and you know I think that's
all that is called but it's so pretty
it's a beautiful champagne highlight
color this one was on the support site
and I think it's sold out now but I'm
pretty sure you can still buy it on the
Estee Lauder website I will find the
link for you guys and link it if it is
available this is a gorgeous shimmery
highlighter because probably know how
much I love highlighters and with spring
and summer coming gotta try all the new
ones like Hello I applied Mac
they'll actually at the highlighter
today and then I applied this over it so
it's super glowy today the next product
that I picked up is also eye illuminator
this one's called indiscretion by Laura
Mercier and it's so beautiful I love
this one I know they have one very
similar last year that they came out
with I think it was a little bit more
gold I didn't pick that one up but I
picked up this one it's a gorgeous
champagne color again no one needs as
many highlighters as I have they're all
so similar but this one is just
beautiful I couldn't resist the next
product is by bite it's the agave lip
mask I've already mentioned this in two
videos since I've gotten it and I'm
obsessed he didn't already see there's a
little little dent I'm making in there
um I would compare this to honey it's
literally a honey consistency and you
put it on your lips and if you guys have
dry lips this stuff is amazing one of my
subscribers recommend it actually I
think a bunch of them were recommending
it after she had recommended it and I'm
in love with this so thank you to
everyone who recommended me this I love
hearing your suggestions on what your
favorite products are because it's
always cool to try out new products and
sometimes the Sephora website or even
the Sephora store can be so overwhelming
with products that you can look past
some of the good ones because there's
just so many to look at so this is great
I've been using it every single day and
I'm in love so the next product that I
got was by Becca it's the shimmering
skin Perfector in the color opal
oh okay there was a garbage so yes this
is the skin Perfector in opal at first I
was like wait so is it the same thing as
the opal highlighter that I already have
but it said it was more of like a creamy
consistency so that's why I ordered it
and I love this because it's really
really creamy it's basically the same
color as the pressed powder highlighter
but this one's more of a cream a
highlighter so depending on what type
you prefer some people prefer cream
highlighter some people prefer the
powder what I like to do also is
sometimes apply the cream and then the
it powder over it so it gives it like a
double glow and it gives you that
beautiful beautiful shimmery look so
this one is great I love it I mean if
you guys have the powdered opal you
don't really need the creamy opal unless
you guys are a highlighter freak like me
and just need every single one that you
come across so the next product that I
picked up was stay don't stray my
benefit I got it in the color light
medium and this is a supposed to be a
base for your eyes and also a base for
your concealer I've tried that one is
illuminating like a huge difference as
far as the eye shadow where the
concealer lasting any longer I think
because I use so many products and I
really make sure it stays on good it
kind of stays regardless so I don't know
how I feel about this yet I will use it
again and I'll let you guys know if I
really see a difference but I heard
really good things about it so I wanted
to pick it up so that's basically the
only reason I got it from word of mouth
but we shall see the next thing that I
picked up it was something that I've
been eyeing for a while now but I just
didn't know if I wanted to spend the
money on it it's the Kevin o Kwan
shaping powder I think it's called the
shaping powder sculpting powder in the
color medium I decided to purchase it
only because I've been having a severe
obsession with rate zone powders to
contour with and the only ones that I've
been using really are the Anastacio and
the Kat Von D powders so those ones are
great but I just figured let's see what
all the hype is about the sculpting
powder and it really is a great perfect
color to contour with so it depends on
what you guys are looking for I think
this powder is about the same price as
the contour kits so I mean if you guys
are on a budget or if you don't want to
spend too much money I would say go for
the Kat Von D contour kit over this
because it has basically a very similar
shade and it's gonna give you more
powders with it so it really depends on
what you guys are looking for but I love
this shade it's a great color to contour
with so I've been using this the past
couple of days and I've been really
happy with it
the next product I haven't even taken
out of the box yet it's by Guerlain I
don't know if I'm moving pronouncing
that right it's called baby glow and
it's light revealing sheer makeup with
sunscreen anti fatigue effect and it has
SPF 20 in it so what I assumed this was
like is like a CC cream or BB cream
again I haven't tried it yet but the
reviews on support comm we're all like
five-star like must-have so again with
spring and summer on the corner I'm
always looking for great EB creams
something more lightweight because when
it's hot the last thing we want is the
cake on the makeup so I haven't tried
this yet I do plan on trying it this
week or next week so I will keep you
guys updated but again all the reviews
were 4 or 5 stars so I thought let me
try it out and the last thing that I
picked up was this cute little baby
panda umm it's supposed to be an eye
base like a brightening eye base I
honestly haven't even tried it yet let
me see I'm not really sure if this is
used for under your eye or as an
eyeshadow base but I'm assuming it's for
under your concealer because it's a
white shade that's gonna it's kind of
more like a sheer white shade that's
supposed to be brightening I don't
really know what it's supposed to do but
when I saw this cute little panda I was
like I need it in my life so again I'm
gonna check on the website and I live
right below what it's used for because
I'm not really sure I haven't tried it
yet but I mean look at this cute little
panda how could you insist so that is it
as far as my last two sephora hauls i
picked up some really great products and
i'm loving and some that i haven't tried
out yet but as requested i want to
continue to try new products and keep
updating you guys with what's the best
on the market because i think that was
one of the things that you guys were
accosted most for this year so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I love you
guys so much and until next time I'll
see
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
