it's been quite a bit since I posted in
everyday
simple easy makeup tutorial if you guys
are anything like me and you really
don't have a lot of time to do your
makeup in the morning this video will be
very helpful for you guys whenever I'm
in a rush I basically have the exact
same routine down to a science so I can
do it all in under ten minutes and this
is perfect for when you're rushing or if
you wake up too late you miss your alarm
and you want to just throw yourself
together really quick so if you guys
want to learn how to get this really
simple easy look please keep watching
the first night I should left you find
me start off this look I'm using by
l'oreal the magic nude foundation in the
color 320 and you want to make sure to
shake it before you apply it because it
is a little bit liquidy and I'm going to
be applying this all over my entire face
me
next I'm gonna be filling in my eyebrows
because whenever you put your foundation
on it always tends to lighten the hair
on your eyebrows I'm using my brow bar
to go and I'm just going over on my
natural brows
picking this lighter brown color I'm
then gonna be applying that right into
the crease of my eyes and this is just
gonna help me wake up a little bit it's
gonna make my eyes look a little bit
wider and more open
to highlight my eyes a bit I'm taking
this white color from my 28 neutral
palette from BH and I'm just gonna be
applying this right on my lids and this
is gonna brighten my eye again making
them appear more wider and opening up
your eye a bit and I'm also gonna be
applying this in the tear duct and also
underneath my brows
for concealer I'm using by Laura Mercier
and sc3 and just was my finger I'm going
to be applying it right underneath my
eyes
you
to set my foundation and concealer I'm
using my Maybelline the mineral veil and
I'm using it with my same fluffy brush
that I use for my foundation next comes
mascara I'm using my all-time favorite
L'Oreal telescopic and this just goes on
the top and bottom lashes as usual
so keep in mind because of my intro and
everything like that the times a little
bit off but right at this moment I was
at 6 minutes and 15 seconds just to keep
you guys updated on the time
moving on to blush I'm using the 10
color palette from the age at this nice
light pink color and I'm going to be
applying this right onto the apples of
my cheek and since the weather is a
little bit colder I always stay away
from my bronzer because I don't have
that nice Sun glow that I usually get in
the summer so I love picking a nice
bright blush to really brighten up your
face I'm gonna be taking that dark brown
color again and I'm just gonna very
lightly be contouring in my cheeks and
also around my nose and again this is
just a very very light contour just to
add some dimension in my face
her lip liner I'm using tawny by Jordana
but I actually came across one by Milani
and I'll list it below but it's so
similar and I know a lot of people have
been having some trouble finding the
Jordana online so the Milani is a great
alternative
and for gloss I'm using my favorite nude
gloss from color your smile and it is a
lip plumper and I'm going to be applying
this on my lips as I normally would and
it's very pigmented so it's perfect for
when you're in a rush because it's gonna
last you all day
whatever excess eyeshadow I have left on
my brush I'm just gonna be highlighting
my Cupid's bow which is right on your
lips and that's just again I'm gonna
give you a nice little highlight since I
had an extra few seconds I'm just adding
a little bit more blush and a little bit
more mascara because it has dried and I
want to make them look even more spider
like for those of you who don't like the
spider lashes that's completely fine but
for me I actually love long sick lashes
especially when I'm doing a quick makeup
look and I don't really have either
eyeliner or any other makeup on and
voila
I'm all finished and I did it in under 9
minutes actually 8 minutes and 58
seconds to be exact so this is the final
result super easy super simple and it's
perfect for anyone who's in a rush I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I know
I saw a ton of you guys asking for an
everyday school look or an updated
simple look so this one was for all of
you definitely try out this routine and
the more you try it out the quicker
you'll be able to do it and that way you
never have to worry about rolling out of
bed and then heading off to where we
gotta go I hope this video helped and
until next time bad guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
