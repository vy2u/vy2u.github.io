couple of you had asked me what my
everyday makeup look was so I decided to
do a video showing you what I would
normally do on a day-to-day basis first
I use Revlon age-defying makeup it has
DNA advantage in it so it's supposed to
prevent your skin from aging I'm also
going to be using a small dual fiber
brush from Mac and this isn't a goal on
my entire face
following that I'm going to be using
their mineral mineral Dale and also a
bare minerals fluff brush this is going
to go all over my entire face these
patterns set my foundation then by
Guarnere I'm going to be using an
under-eye concealer and it has caffeine
in it so it wakes you up and it also
makes your eyes appear more opened this
is going to go right underneath my eyes
and I'm just going to blend that in with
my fingers
then using a small angled brush I'm
going to fill in my eyebrows a dark
brown eye shadow
my favorite bronzer to use is by
Maybelline it's a mineral power bronzer
it's called sunset bronze and this is
gonna go all over my face using a angled
fluff brush by Mac instead of putting
bronzer all over my face like some
people do I just do it as if I'm
contouring my face so I do it on my
cheekbones underneath my neck and also
on my forehead
then as an eyeshadow base I'm going to
be using Revlon concealer and that's
just going to go underneath my eyeshadow
it's going to help the eyeshadow stay on
all day with the Mac small shader brush
I'm going to be using this second light
color and thus enabling palette this is
a limited edition quad by Maybelline
it's called strutted suede I had just
gotten it about two weeks ago so if you
do want to get it I suggest you go to
Walgreens or CVS soon because it does a
limited edition on it this color is
gonna go all over my eyelids and also
underneath my brow bone next I'm going
to be using the third color over and my
Mac blending brush and this is just
going to go right into my crease
using my Mac pencil brush I'm going to
be using the darkest color in this quad
this color is just gonna go right into
my crease
and then I'm gonna go back to the
blending brush and I'm gonna blend it
all in very nicely this darker color and
my creases I make my eyes also appear a
little bit bigger
using something with the shoot edge
always makes your eyeshadow look perfect
so I always do this as well
for my everyday look I'll use the
Jordana eye pencil and I'll just use it
in the inner corners of my eyes just to
make my eyes appear a little bit longer
I don't usually wear eyeliner on the top
of my eye every day so again I'm just
gonna be using this inner part of my eye
going back to the Mack pencil brush I'm
going to be using the third color on
this palette and this is just going to
go right underneath my eyes
apply your at mascara as you normally
would
and then I line my lips with Jordana lip
liner in the color 20 it's very natural
in the following step I'm going to be
putting the second color in this quad
right in the tear duct of my eyes and
then also right on top of my lips my
life is always a constant wash so by
doing this simple look it makes time go
by a lot quicker and I also look very
put together if you're busy like me and
you just need a simple quick natural
look I hope you take my advice and go
out and try this I just wanted to say
thank you so much for everybody who's
been watching my videos and all the nice
comments and support I really really
appreciate it and I'll be posting more
videos soon thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
