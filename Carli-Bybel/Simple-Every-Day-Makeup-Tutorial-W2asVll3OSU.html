been some time since I've done a simple
everyday makeup look I think this look
is perfect for those of you guys still
in school or college or if you guys have
work and you just kind of want to throw
yourself together in a short amount of
time this makeup look took me under 15
minutes to do so I hope you guys enjoy
this video and if you want to learn how
I got this look please keep watching to
start off this look I'm just applying a
little bit of this agave lip mask onto
my lips because my lips have been super
dry I just wanted to thank one of my
subscribers because you recommended this
to me and I have been obsessed ever
since I got it it's literally like honey
for your lips I feel like next I'm
priming my face with my favorite primer
this one is the Smashbox pore minimizing
primer and I love using this because it
really smoothes out any pores any fine
lines that kind of mattifies your face
so if you guys are looking for a really
good primer this one I definitely
recommend spending the money on I use it
all the time and my new favorite thing
is to use a pore minimizing primer
because it makes the foundation go on so
much nicer and smoother and it doesn't
seep into your pores I was thinking of
filming a new contour tutorial for my
nose because look at this baby so many
people have been recently yelling at me
saying that I got a nose job again and
look at it those look like I got a nose
job I don't think that for foundation
I'm using the matte and poreless number
220 by Maybelline and I'm applying it
with my Mac 190 brush
so you're just going to lightly apply it
all over your face don't blend it in
just kind of wipe it on
and then I'm blending my foundation in
with my damp Beauty Blender I've been
loving the beauty blender to blend my
foundation in because it really makes
the foundation look flawless on your
face
if you guys don't have a Beauty Blender
you can use a regular foundation brush
of course so don't feel like you need to
do this um I just been doing this lately
and I've been liking how it looks so
that's just my little routine s at the
moment
for concealer I'm using the age rewind
in the color light I love this concealer
because it cut it looks like it's coming
out heavy but it's very very thin so
then you just blend in again
you just want to apply this concealer
wherever you have like darker spots if
you have any pimples of course you can
cover those as well next I'm just
filling in my brows with my brow bar to
go in the darker shade if you guys want
a full in-depth eyebrow tutorial I just
posted one so I will link it for you
guys
to set my concealer I'm using this
powder from Make Up For Ever it's the
pro finished powder this is just so the
concealer won't crease
so next we're bronzer I'm using this new
to phase the little book of bronzers and
it's all of their bronzers that they
have in their collection I actually have
this in the larger version so when it
came in the mail and it was the smaller
version I was just like oh my god it's
so cute so how to use it today so I'm
gonna go with a matte bronzer so I'm
going to use the milk chocolate bronzer
right here
so since we're just doing a simple
everyday look I'm not going to be
contouring I'm just going to be using
these bronzer shades as a bronzer to
kind of warm up my face but I'm applying
the bronzer where I would normally apply
my contour shade so I mean if you guys
have the time and you want to contour a
little bit you can use a more drier tone
right in your contour zones but for
today I'm just going to add some bronzer
with my Sigma e-40 blending brush I'm
going to be taking a little bit of that
bronzer and just applying it right into
the crease of my eye and this is just to
kind of make my eyes look more awake
you
so this part is a hundred percent
optional most of you probably won't have
the time and I really don't recommend it
but just for me since I'm so used to
contouring my nose I'm just gonna take a
sigma e45 brush and the color mink
it's a contour shade the new one from
Anastasia and I'm just going to very
lightly draw two little lines on the
sides of my nose and that's just again
because I feel more comfortable that way
once I learned how to contour my nose
right I just can't go a day without
doing it so call me crazy but I'm just
gonna very lightly draw lines just to
thin out my nose a little bit
so next moving on set blush I'm using
this one by NYX in the color statement
in red I don't know why it's called
stateman red when it's pink but I like
using these mineralized blushes because
they give it a nice little shimmer and
they're not too too pigmented so you
just kind of build on them which is good
because sometimes when you put too much
blush it's like oh no I can't really
blend in and it kind of just ruins all
the work that you already did
so next I'm just applying my L'Oreal
telescopic mascara
next moving on to lips I'm using
stripped down by Mac to line them and
then for lipstick I'm using butter cut
by drug cosmetics
so this is the final result it was super
quick and super easy so I hope you guys
can incorporate it into your routines
and hopefully it will help you guys
throw yourself together in a short
amount of time so I hope you guys
