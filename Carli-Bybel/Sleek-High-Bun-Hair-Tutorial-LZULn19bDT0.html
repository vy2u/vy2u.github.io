like how my hair looks right now then
continue watching and I will show you
how I did this you first want to brush
out your hair to make sure that it's
very smooth and you're not going to have
any bumps
using a hare Tiger then going to brush
out your hair and put it up in a high
ponytail
when you're doing this make sure you
brush through the top as well as
underneath that way it's super smooth
and you don't have any bumps
you
you then want to take a brush with a lot
of bristles to smooth out your hair
completely
I'm using bed heads maxed-out hairspray
and I'm just spraying this in the front
of my hair with this I'm also going to
be taking a old toothbrush that I use
just basically for my hair and you're
going to smooth little flyaways in the
front
this is a simple way to tame your
flyaways if you have bunch of them like
me
you're then going to want to take an old
sock or an old leg warmer and cut the
tip off this is going to go into your
hair to help form the bun you're going
to pull the sock down and roll it like
this
next you're going to put your hand
through it and slip it right into your
ponytail
you're going to take the front half of
your ponytail and flip it over the front
of your hair
you're then going to take another hair
tie and gently put it over the sock and
form the bun
the hair that's left over you're going
to slide around the bun and start
pinning it with bobby pins
you then want to spray your hair again
just making sure it's completely smooth
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
