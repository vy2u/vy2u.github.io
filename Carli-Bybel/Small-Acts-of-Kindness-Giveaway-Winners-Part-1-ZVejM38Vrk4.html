hi everyone thank you for watching so
I'm sorry that it's taken this long for
me to get up this video believe me I
know how anxious all of you are when I
had first originally announced the
giveaway I mean I was expecting amazing
entries and I know how amazing my
followers are so I knew you guys would
be putting a lot of energy and
everything into it but when it came down
to actually sitting there and watching
all the entries it was so amazing how
much I connected with you guys just
through the screen and I obviously
didn't want to take this long to do this
but it was literally impossible and I
just I felt so connected to each one of
you that narrowing it down was
absolutely impossible and I have to have
help from Brett and my mom because I
don't know I feel like I'm biased I feel
like I'm on every single one of your
side and I don't know it's just so hard
Italy watching these videos goes to show
one thing that I've stated since they
want that every single person out there
wants to be loved and wants to be
respected and wants to be treated with
respect kindness everything like that
and this giveaway goes to show that no
matter where you are located no matter
where you are in the world whatever
color your skin tone is however old you
are what color your hair is if you have
no hair whatever it is it doesn't matter
because in the inside we all truly want
the same thing and this giveaway was a
perfect example of how just doing one
little thing for somebody can really
spread something so huge and I hope this
continues and I hope all of you will
continue to do the small acts of
kindness and the small deeds for other
people and I swear you guys inspired me
so much if any of you actually
participated you know what it's like and
it's just such a beautiful feeling
helping someone and if you don't realize
it at first later on you will realize
why it's so big and why it's so
important and I know this is gonna be
really hard for me and just thinking
about it right now I'm already getting
teary eyed because I really I don't want
to hurt anyone
feelings because I know so many of you
put in so much effort and sorry um and I
don't want any of you to feel that like
your act wasn't good enough because they
were also amazing and I really really
feel connected to all of you and I wish
more than anything that if I haven't met
you yet one day we will cost paths and I
will try my best to make it around
everywhere just to meet some of you guys
because all of you guys just proved to
me how amazing people can be and I
really really do consider you guys my
friends and I really really do love you
guys Oh so without further ado let's get
started with the winners because I'm
sure you guys are fast forwarding this
anyway
the first winner is Niall me from Miami
and she went above and beyond because
not only did she take out some clothes
from her closet to donate to a local
charity she also had bins and bins of
clothes from her little sisters and just
from clothes that they weren't using
anymore and they took the extra step and
are shipping it off to Haiti her video
really touched me when she did this
extra step when one bad thing happens
everyone tends to jump on the train to
help and then the next big thing happens
and people tend to forget about the past
events that were huge tragedies so for
not only to make this video and for her
to think to send clothes three years
later really really touched my heart and
it shows how thoughtful and how amazing
I'm a person she is so Naomi I really
appreciated your entry you are a
beautiful beautiful girl and I hope you
enjoy your fifty dollar gift card the
next winner really touched my heart she
broke my heart too she told her story
which I'm sure felt really really good
taking it off her chest she had wrote
her story down on a piece of notebook
paper and held it up to tell people and
at the end of the video she didn't show
the top of her face because I guess it
was more to get her story out to help
other people and to let people know that
things do happen and things can go wrong
and it's so important to talk about it
to people because there are people who
care there are people who listen and
when you let it out it's possible to
change and there was actually another
video along with Maritza's that was
pretty similar and honestly I'm so
thankful for both of you girls that
takes such strength maritza you're
amazing you're an inspiration and I'm so
happy you're here to tell your story and
keep telling it because the more you
share with other people the more you can
help them and they can feel maybe not so
alone and thank you for taking the time
and I still appreciate you and I hope
you enjoy your gift card my next winner
is Jerrica bárcenas I think that's how
you say it I hope I didn't say it wrong
but your video again was another one
that really stuck out as above and
beyond
it really was touching in the beginning
how you when
and gave that box full of goodies to the
mother and that baby because you never
know who could need it that was just a
really beautiful thing that you did and
it was really really inspiring to me and
that was one of the reasons I did pick
you for winning this gift card but I
also liked how you went when you went to
Johnny Rockets and you sat there and you
wrote out all those little notes and
then you actually went around and pass
it to people and I applaud you because
it is difficult going up to people like
that and I'm sure some people were
looking at you like who is this girl
what is she doing but I'm sure you got
out of this whole exercise the beauty of
being kind and I know you did and I
loved all the sweet words you had to say
so thank you so much and I hope you
enjoy your gift card so my next two
winners are Katherine and Jessica
Hernandez you two are so so amazing and
it was so cute listening to you guys sit
there and talk about everything that you
guys were doing and I think what stood
out the most for me was that you
actually went out to the thrift store
and you picked up a couple sweaters and
you got blankets and pillows and
toothbrushes and a lot of necessities
that most people would never think about
buying someone but I mean you really
really thought about that and you really
put so much effort into it and I loved
how you just brought that whole big
suitcase over to who was her name shoe
Julie jewel sorry but honestly that was
one of the most beautiful videos I did
see and I loved how much effort you guys
put into it and quick sidenote Kathy I
was actually being a little bit creepy
earlier and I saw your new Instagram and
I saw you got a haircut and girl you
look hot I love it and you totally rock
it so enjoy guys okay and the final
winner for the $50 Amazon gift card is
going to Chelsea from Pennsylvania
Chelsea coder I believe and your video
was so cute and it made me cry again um
I loved how you took the opportunity
because your friend was dealing with
some family issues and you went out and
you made that cute little basket with
the candles and some candy and just like
a girl's necessities for when she's
going through a hard time and honestly
you are such a great friend and I am
sure she
beats you so much I wanted to make sure
you got this gift card to hopefully
spend on yourself because it was a
really beautiful thing that you did for
your friend and I loved your videos and
if you guys want to know who won first
second third fourth fifth and six please
keep watching
so for fourth fifth and sixth prize I'm
not going to name these in any
particular order because again I just
kind of grouped them off into the
winning pieces because again it was so
hard to choose but the first one that
I'm gonna announce is que vita bella'
and this angel was amazing enough to
film something that she actually does on
a day-to-day basis
she works with kids with special needs
for instance down to Jim which she
showed in this video and she sits there
and she teaches them different tools and
different techniques to be more
independent it was honestly so amazing
seeing your patience and your love and
just as something as simple as buttoning
your pants you know you made it clear
that we take so many things for granted
it was also so amazing seeing him
actually do the button so thank you so
much for sharing that with us and thank
you so much for everything you do you
deserve everything and more and you are
just such an angel and there needs to be
so many more people like you on this
earth so congrats and let me know what
brushes and which gift card you would
like the next winner is Jailene and her
video was so touching and so
inspirational for me for many reasons
she showed or first she explained how
her long hair for her entire life has
always been her identity so that's kind
of been like her one thing that made her
her and what she did in memory of Talia
joy is she cut off her hair and donated
it to people in need and this one was
again very touching because obviously
everyone knows the insanely enormous
impact that Talia had on everybody and
when she passed away she had everybody
in tears and it was just so amazing to
see you do this tribute to her and I
really really appreciated that you
filmed it and with such great quality
and honestly everything about the video
was just so amazing and it really really
stood out to me so thank you so much and
by the way your short hair looks so
beautiful I absolutely loved it and
thank you so much for entering and love
you girl I don't winner for this round
goes to Valentina ji and your video was
a huge wake-up call um I was crying
along with you I mean for you to even
put in the scene of you crying
afterwards I mean it really just goes to
show how huge of an impact it had and I
mean it's just insane to think that
there's children and families on the
street without eating without having
food and I mean unfortunately it's
reality and seeing it and seeing your
reaction and just seeing how sweet you
were with these kids it absolutely had
me in tears and you are just so amazing
and I know you're so young but please
keep doing what you're doing because
these amazing little things they all
will make you such a better person in
the end and it will just be so rewarding
knowing you've helped other people in
your video is definitely one of my
favorites so thank you so much for
entering and I hope you enjoy your gifts
I'm going to start with third place and
I was kind of back and forth not sure
about first second third and again thank
you to everyone who entered I love you
guys I appreciate you guys and through a
lot of deliberation I finally got down
to the top three
so third place goes to the sweet angel
route and you are so amazing
not only was your English amazing
because I know you were a little worried
I wouldn't be able to understand you you
don't give yourself enough credit you
speak beautifully just by your story and
what you showed me in this short five
minute video you made me fall in love as
you you can tell you've been through a
lot but you know what family needed you
and you came and you lived with your
sister to help take care of your niece
who is absolutely gorgeous by the way
she's beautiful and I wish nothing but
the best for both of you and I can't
wait to meet you through a Skype phone
call you're so beautiful you're so
amazing you're such an inspiration and
just to see what you deal with and what
you do on a day to day basis it makes me
want to be a better person it makes me
want to get out there and go do things
for other people and I mean thank you so
much for entering I know it probably
took a lot to do what you did and to
share the story and everything but I
just saw the love in your eyes and I
really really think you deserve this so
thank you again for entering I love you
and I cannot wait to Skype phone call
with you
so my second place winner goes to such
an amazing person beautiful Jude
seriously let me just say one thing you
should not be embarrassed at all you
literally changed my life I don't know
if it was I think you look a little bit
like my aunt so I think that got me
connected right away but just hearing
your story and hearing what you've been
through and hearing how on like bad days
that you would watch my videos and you
would see like a light in Maine that it
would make you happy and make you look
forward to things
I don't know it just really really
really touched me and your story was
amazing and I cannot wait to Skype phone
call you because you are such such an
inspiration and one of the other reasons
why I completely fell in love with you
it's because you told me how it's very
hard for you to write and to even talk
but one thing you've been doing for the
past 30 years was to create handwritten
cards for people that you love for
people that take care of you for people
that you crossed paths with and one
thing in my family that's always been
really big especially between me and my
mom were cards and we would always sing
every single year for any holiday for
any birthdays especially we would always
get each other these like super long
cards we get each other like four or
five of them because for us the cards
were the most important and I don't know
I just you are so amazing and so
inspirational I loved how you said that
our generation needs to be doing more
things like this spreading more love
spreading more kindness because it
really is a contagious thing and I don't
know I just you made me cry and you can
make me cry thinking about it but you're
so amazing and I hope one day if you
have some extra time you can make me a
handwritten card because as I had just
stated I love cards and yeah Jude
honestly thank you for your video I know
that must have gained a lot out of you
and I so greatly appreciate it little
things in life are what's so important
and thank you for reminding all of us
about that and you honestly touched my
heart and I will never forget you
so the first prize winner if you guys
have been following the entries and
following along I think this is really
no surprise here and again it was so
hard but Christina you honestly have
just by numbers I could see how many
people you have inspired I could see how
many comments you've gotten and how many
people you've already helped with just
this one video and I know it must have
been so hard for you to tell your story
to remove your wig to talk about some of
the hardships you've been through and
your story really really did touch me
and I don't know it was one of the first
ones I watched and I couldn't forget
about you and just seeing how many
people were impacted by your video
really really impacted me and I knew I
had to choose you for the grand prize
winners so I hope you are excited you
get to come out to New York whoever you
want to fly out with you you feel free
and I can't wait to meet you honestly if
you haven't seen Christina's video I
highly suggest watching it and Christina
has been dealing with a disorder called
trichotillomania I believe that is how
you pronounce it Christina your video
not only was it amazing because you
shared your story you gave different
tips on ways to deal with it because I
actually have known some people that
have dealt with this problem and some
people maybe think there are no options
there are no ways to make yourself feel
beautiful again
so again Christina thank you so much I
hope you're excited I'm super super
excited to meet you I will be in contact
I'll be messaging all of you guys all
the winners actually on YouTube to
receive your email address to get all
the information but I'm so excited to
meet you in New York City and to explore
and hopefully do some awesome things
together mean bread are gonna have some
fun things planned so honestly this
giveaway was absolutely life-changing if
you did not win please know you are
still a winner I know at each and every
one of you who created this video felt
something maybe for the first time or
maybe something that you do on a
continuous basis and I will forever
continue to promote inner beauty and to
do small things for other people
is so before the video ends I did decide
to add 9 extra little winners because it
was super hard for me to narrow this
down and I could not wait any longer or
wait another day because you guys were
all waiting for this
