through
cuz I've seen it - hi everyone thank you
for watching so I'm so so excited to be
announcing this new giveaway for you
guys it's gonna be definitely a little
bit different than anything I've done
before I originally saw this idea that
the Luxy sisters did they're from luxy
hair and I honestly almost cried
watching the video and I knew as soon as
I saw it that this was so perfect for my
channel so it's gonna be kind of like a
challenge for most of the prizewinners
and it's gonna be cool because I know I
get a lot of comments saying well I
never win the chances are so hard to win
but this time around instead of doing
random winners we're actually going to
be doing video responses and I'm going
to be watching all your responses and
I'm going to be choosing the winners
that way if any of you don't feel
comfortable filming and uploading on to
YouTube or if you don't have a camera to
film but you can really use your iPhone
or whatever phone that you have it
doesn't have to be great quality that is
fine I will have five prizes for those
people so don't worry no one is disgu
looted from this competition again
there's gonna be eleven prizes so ten of
them you can enter if you are from
wherever in the world it's gonna be an
international giveaway and the one grand
prize winner is going to be from the
United States and once I go through the
prizes you'll understand why but so
don't worry if you are not from the
United States you have ten chances to
win and again if you don't want to do
the video you do have five chances to
win ever since day one one thing that
I've always stuck to was to stay
positive and to be nice to other people
no matter what you have going on because
honestly every single human being out
there is going through something and if
you can give someone your smile just
even for five minutes you have no idea
what that little thing can do for
someone so what I want to see from this
is I want you
yes--you I'm talking to you so you go
out and do something nice for somebody
else or someone you don't know
preferably so for example you can go out
and if you see it an elder person
wanting across the road you can give
them a hand just something simple like
that you can go click your mom breakfast
in bed anything out of the normal that
you wouldn't do on a day to day basis or
something you haven't done before I want
you to challenge yourself and to go out
of your comfort
Sonne and just see how rewarding it is
to help somebody who can do nothing for
you or that will do nothing for you for
this you don't have to go out and spend
any money as I said you can just do
something a nice gesture wise but if you
do want to go out and like spend
something by someone something nice that
is okay too I'm gonna leave this
completely up to you guys I want to see
your nice deed and it's a way to spread
the love and one thing I've always said
is ya may be crazy to think you can
change the world by doing nice things
but think about it the more nice things
you do people will either learn from
that or get inspired by that and one do
more nice things and then you know what
who knows it conventionally lead to
something so much bigger so I'm really
really excited about this challenge
slash giveaway and honestly I've been
sitting down with my notepad out trying
to think of like the greatest prizes
that I can give away for you guys
because I usually do the same old stuff
and I wanted to do something a little
bit special also I wanted to announce
that after this giveaway is over I will
be doing a big giveaway with bellami
hair extensions so for those of you
asking to win hair extensions I promise
that one is coming but I just wanted to
quickly go through all the prizes with
you guys and again like I said I'm so
excited to be announcing this for you
guys before I mention the prizes I just
wanted to say that now that it's August
it's almost 2 years since I've been here
on YouTube which is so crazy
August 11th was the date that I started
my facebook beauty page and I can't
believe it's been two years and I
remember I first started it just to do
some beauty tips and just to see how it
where it went and I was getting a lot of
requests for tutorials so I think it was
later on in August when I eventually put
up my first video and I will put a clip
of it if I can try and get it but from
then to now it's just so funny how much
I've learned and how much I've grown
it's crazy what this experience did for
me and I am honestly so grateful for
every single one of you guys and I can't
stress that enough and if I haven't told
you in a while I seriously love you and
I wish nothing but the best for you guys
so enough of that let's get on to the
prizes if the thought of doing a video
and posting on YouTube absolutely
terrifies you and there's no chance that
you will do it I have 5 prizes for those
people so you still can enter I will be
listing all the details below so
definitely check that out but there will
be 5 people who will win a
dollar Amazon giftcard next we're gonna
be talking about what you will win for
the video entries and again these ones
are gonna be picked
just by me and Brett's gonna help me as
well and we're gonna go through all of
them so you really do have a chance if
you put effort into this which I'm so
excited to just kind of meet some of you
guys just seeing a face to the name
would be really cool so the fourth fifth
and sixth place winners will be winning
two back makeup brushes of your choice
and a $50 gift card to your favorite
online website the second and third
place winners will get oil products
views in your favorite video of mine so
say you have a makeup look that's your
favorite look and you don't have the
products to recreate it you can say
Carly this is the video that I choose
and I will go out and buy every single
product that I use whether it's makeup
or hair stuff so whichever video you
like pick that and also besides that two
people the second and third place people
will get to do a Skype phone call with
me and Brett and we'll get to actually
meet face to face which is gonna be so
awesome and drumroll please
the grand prize winner and again this
one is us Oh us only so I do apologize
but the grand prize winner will win a
trip to New York City with a friend for
a whole weekend Brett and I will be
picking you guys up from the airport and
we will be taking you out for the day in
New York City to go for lunch and just
to explore for a little bit so I'm
honestly so excited for that how cool is
that gonna be a trip to New York City
with your friend for a whole weekend and
you get to meet me and Brad will get to
hang out for a little bit go for lunch
and then you'll have the rest of the
weekend to enjoy yourself in New York
City and the reason that it is only for
the US for that is because this giveaway
is not sponsored by anybody this is just
all out of our pockets because we wanted
to show you how grateful we are
especially me and I mean he just started
two months ago and he does not stop
talking about how grateful and how
amazing you guys are and he's only been
in again only two months but he said how
much of a life-changing opportunity this
has been and we are so grateful so we
wanted to show our gratitude and for
these prizes so I hope you guys are
excited as
I am about this and again I cannot wait
to see your video responses I'm sure you
guys are going to come up with some
amazing ideas and your videos don't
forget to include a little description
about yourself because I'd love to get
to know some of you guys and best of
luck to all of you all directions in
order will be below so definitely check
