today's video I'm going to show you how
i got this makeup look right here this
money because usually in the past we
think of berry lips that we think of the
fall and we think of the winter but I've
still been seeing the berry lip transfer
into the summer time I teamed up with
Sephora to create this video for you
guys talking about this new trend and
they label this as a hot trend for
summer so I wanted to show you guys the
shimmery lids and then two berry lip
options ones a little bit more of a
cooler tone and then this is the more
warmer to an option so if you guys want
to see how I got this makeup look please
keep watching to start off this look I
am priming my eyes with stay don't stray
then I'm going in with this dark grey
color from Sephora it's great because
you can use it as just a gray shade or
if you get your brush a little bit wet
it's gonna give it a dark black shade so
I kind of did the grayish in the crease
and then I am getting the brush wet to
make it really dark on the outer V
now that I've blended that all out I'm
going in with this NARS shade and it's a
beautiful shimmery silver color and I
absolutely love this shade then I'm just
going back to my blending brush and just
blending it out so it looks really nice
and even
next I'm using my Kat Von D tattoo
eyeliner and this one's definitely my
favorite at the moment just gonna give
it a nice wing and then I'm going to
extend it in the inner part of my eye
that's just the way I prefer to always
do my eyeliner because it really makes
my eyes look longer and bigger next I'm
picking up this Golden Arrows essence
shade this one's by Kat Von D and it's
the first time I'm using it and I
absolutely love how era destined it is
if you look at it in certain lights it
looks one color and then if you look
different way it looks a little bit
different so it's really really pretty I
love how this came out this is just
going in my tear duct as well as
underneath my lower lash line
then to contour my face I am using the
shade and light palette by Kat Von D I'm
using the warm tones of bronze up my
face a bit
with the smaller tapered brush and the
gray shade I am just contouring the
sides of my nose and then I'm just using
my Beauty Blender to just blend it all
out for blush I am using super orgasm by
NARS and it's a beautiful peachy shade
so the first lipstick that I am wearing
today is by bite and it's called juniper
and this is a more cooler tone berry
it's more like a strawberry in my
opinion I think this color screams
summertime I think you can really pair
it with something dramatic on the eyes
like what I have or something really
subtle and it'll just spice up your look
a little bit but I absolutely love this
color
I'm not pairing any lip liners with this
look I'm just using a small lip brush to
sharpen up the edges and the next color
is also by bite and this one is called
plum and it was actually the first time
I've tried bites lipsticks I tried a
whole bunch of different berry colors
and used to just ended up being my
favorites the two that I wanted to use
in this look so one thing that I did
love about them was their consistency
how pigmented it was but yet how
moisturizing it was at the same time so
that is why I decided to choose those
two and then stop to look off I'm
highlighting with Becca opal so this is
the final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and remember don't be afraid
to try out the berry lip for summertime
because it's approved by me and it's
approved pipe Sephora so I hope you guys
enjoyed and until next time I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
