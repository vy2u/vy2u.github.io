hope everyone had an amazing weekend and
enjoyed their Valentine's Day did any of
you guys try out my looks because with
this giveaway going on it's so hard to
see anything you guys are tagging me in
because it's flooded with all the
giveaway entries so I hope you guys
enjoyed those Valentine's Day looks that
I had for you guys and today I am going
to be doing a big haul everything from
fashion to shoes it's been quite a bit
since I've done a haul video and there's
been so many makeup and hair videos
mostly makeup on my channel lately so I
wanted to switch it up and show you guys
some new things that I've been buying me
and Brett are going on vacation for his
birthday I surprised him and we're going
to Playa del Carmen so my little Carmen
yeah that's right so we're going to
Playa del Carmen in March so the past
couple weeks I've been buying some new
stuff to bring with me so this is kind
of like a spring /summer haul or a
vacation haul since I am going somewhere
tropical so if you guys want to see some
of the things that I bought please keep
watching so I know we still have a few
more months left of winter and then we
have spring and we have quite a bit till
summer but like I said I am going on
vacation so I bought a few bathing suits
and I also noticed a lot of the websites
are starting to transfer over to more
warmer weather appropriate outfits so to
say so that's exciting but I picked up a
couple different new bikinis
the first bathing suit that I picked up
was this pink and white one from ASOS
and this is the top and then the bottom
is blue and white stripes hard to hold
these off to show them but so it's cute
because it's two different colors and
they're pastels and I just think they're
so cute and Asus has really affordable
bathing suits which is awesome so this
is definitely one of the ones that I
picked up that I will be wearing another
bathing suit that I also got from ASOS
it's this pretty pastel I don't know if
the colors are picking up good on camera
but it's as pretty pastel top and then
the matching bottom and I thought with a
nice tan this would look great so this
is the bottoms
and I tried them on and they look really
good but I'm super pale now so I know
when I get a nice tan and they'll
probably make these bathing suits pop
but another thing that I picked up is a
cover-up so it's from ASOS as well the
brand is River Island and it's just the
see-through beautiful cover-up with some
flower print on it and I thought this
would be perfect to just throw over any
of the bikinis for when I'm going to the
pool and I really really like this so
I'll definitely be wearing this on
vacation I really love bathing suits
like that's a problem and it's not that
I didn't have any for this vacation but
I don't know I was just super excited
and a lot of the websites are starting
to come out with the bikini so the third
bikini that I picked up that I'll
definitely be wearing is this green one
this is the top and then the bottom is
like yellow and green and since Brett's
birthday is Saint Patty's Day which is
the 17th I figured I'm gonna get this
one so I can wear it on his birthday
and he'd be festive and we are leaving
the 18th so we'll have the full day
there the 17th and I ordered a matching
one for Brett so he better wear it
because I like to match with it
he hates me so much but I thought this
would be perfect for st. Patty's Day
with the colors so I think super cute
this one is from revolve clothing and
they have some really cute stuff on
there it is a little bit more of a
pricey website but they do have all
different discounts and if you download
the app I think you can get like a 20%
off discount another thing I also picked
up were these black pants and they're
also like beach wear pants I think these
they're high waist and then they're just
like barely see thorough but they're
just black comfy pants I figure you
could throw that on over your bikini and
I thought it would be perfect so I seen
that these are really big this year the
crochet pants and then just like the
kind of see-through beach wear pants so
I actually have none of them so I
figured what better time to try it out
then on my vacation so these are another
thing I picked up also from revolve
clothing I don't know if you guys saw my
fig a my shoe haul that I had done on my
blog but I listed a million different
shoes and I took some really cool
pictures but another pair that I
actually picked up that I didn't include
in a blog because they came a little bit
late were these pretty babies can you
see them they have white chains on them
which is just so cool and this year I
noticed
I've been buying a lot of white clothing
and I think like the oil white trend is
a really awesome trend that's been going
on for the winter and I think it will
continue into the summertime so I picked
these up first and then when I was on
ASOS I actually found this white chain
necklace so I thought how cute would
that be to put maybe just like a white
tee on with this chain and then maybe
like a skirt and then these shoes and I
thought that would be a really cute
mixture so I'm probably gonna be
bringing these away with me what I like
to do for vacation is I like to pre-plan
outfits like everything down to the
clutch the jewelry and then that way I
don't over pack so I'll just try on a
couple outfits pre-plan the nights and
then that way it's easier to pack and I
don't need to bring like ten things of
luggage so we'll see if I pretend of
bringing these but maybe if you guys
want to see a packing video I usually
wait really last-minute to do the
packing so I will try my best but if
that's something you guys would maybe
want to see let me know and comment
below because I can probably do that and
then show you guys some of the outfits
that I ended up with but I do plan on
bringing my camera and my laptop away
with us so I can hopefully just update
you guys throughout the trip and
everything like that so yeah let's keep
moving on so I definitely mentioned the
website go Jane to you guys they have
the cutest stuff also and I actually
picked up these shoes from there and
there's this pretty turquoise color and
I really love these and I think I'll be
bringing these away I mean like I said I
do pre plan my outfits so I think one or
two days before my trip I'll probably
try a bunch of things on and then plan
it that way but I also got this cute
leopard top from ASOS and it has that
same turquoise color as the shoe so I
thought how cute would that be if we did
like if we if I did like this shirt
tucked in so maybe like a pair of
turquoise short shorts can't even speak
today turquoise shorts and then paired
it with the issues I thought that'd be
super cute so this again I just picked
up from ASOS I'm sure that's still in
stock but I love it it's just a
button-down and I figured I would like
roll up the sleeves and then it'd be a
perfect outfit for vacation or even just
the springtime in general so if you guys
aren't familiar with New Jersey or if
you don't live anywhere in the area
we've been getting snow and non-stop
it's literally been snowing
every other day so I have been so
excited for this vacation and I've been
so excited for spring clothing so I hope
you guys don't mind I hope I'm not doing
this too early but I think if any of you
guys have a vacation planned or
something for spring break hopefully
this video will be helpful and again I
will be linking all of the products that
I mentioned on my blog along with maybe
some other things that I picked out
along the way cuz we don't want this
video to be 20 hours long so I picked up
this baby blue jacket from Zara about
two or three weeks ago and I have yet to
wear it because I had ordered a purse
that matches it so I will be doing a
blog post with this very soon but I
wanted to show you guys because pastels
are huge this year and I think even in
the winter time they're still amazing
and I love this jacket I just picked it
up so I don't know if they still have it
in stock I will check for you guys but
along with those I purchased these baby
blue heels and they are also Zara and I
thought how cute would they look with
that jacket and I think these are
perfect you can wear them in the winter
or the summer time since they are the
closed toe
they were $99 so they were a little bit
more than I would have wanted to spend
but since they are the closed toe I
figured I could wear them for the winter
along with that blue jacket if you guys
saw my previous fashion posts you
probably saw me mention the website show
PO and it is an Australian based company
so along with that sweater dress that
actually is unfortunately sold out but I
think they're restocking it they had
told me I've got this dress and it's so
cute this is the top and then it like
flares out and the colors are just so
beautiful and it's screams summer so I
figured probably one night in Playa del
Carmen I'll bring this dress because
with a nice tan
I'd probably look really nice and it
fits so perfectly I really really love
that website they also had given all of
my viewers a 10% off code which is
awesome so I will again list all of
those details below but I wanted to just
show you this adorable dress that I
picked up from there the next dress I'm
going to show you I would say you could
wear it in the winter time or the summer
time and this one is from beginning
boutique which is also an
australian-based website and the top has
the net finish and it's like kind of
see-through and then it has a leather
bottom which is so cute so I was
thinking maybe I could pair this with a
pair of like knee-high boots and then a
sweater and learn in the wintertime or
the summertime I can wear a nice pair of
black lace-up sandals and then you can
do like a winter summer mix so I thought
that was really cool that you can kind
of do any season with this dress so I
didn't want to just only mention things
that are spring and summer because we
are only in February still unfortunately
so along with those pastels I've also
picked up this beautiful sweater and
mint green and I love this I was
thinking of doing a blog post with this
probably this week we shall see but I do
have a mint purse that matches it
perfectly so I've always been such a fan
of pastels and I think last year they
started coming up a lot and then this
year you're seeing it everywhere so for
those of you who love pastels you don't
just have to wear them in the summertime
now because they're making sweaters and
jackets and all kinds of fun winter
clothing in the pastels so this sweater
was a little bit pricey because it's
Zehra
but I found almost an exact sweater on a
couple different websites so I will be
linking similar options as well but this
is the sweater it's like a little
cropped sweater it's not too short so
you can wear it with like a pair of
jeans but the sleeves are also cropped
so they're about three-quarter length it
also recently picked up this adorable
Leopard little bag and this is from
Nasty Gal and it's this is originally I
believe $75 so what happened was I had
purchased it for $75 and then literally
the next day all their bags on their
website went on sale for $25 so what I
did was I just reordered the $25 one and
then I shipped back the $75 one because
$25 for this definitely reasonable like
a great option I mean I paid $75 for it
because I love how it's a white leopard
it's not that brown leopard it's a
little bit different and I think this
bag it's perfect for all year round it
could be winter spring summer or
anything I was originally gonna pay $75
for it but then I got lucky and it went
on sale so definitely check out Nasty
Gal they always have different coupons
and different sales going on but I mean
the stuff on the website is just so
adorable so I love this little purse I
actually use this when we went out to
the other night for my sister's birthday
so so when I want those teal shoes that
I had just showed you along with that
leopard shirt I also picked up a couple
little necklaces because the website is
very affordable but this is the necklace
it's just like a gold chain and then I
has like a longer gold chain right here
so what I figure it is I would wear like
maybe like a low-cut white blouse and
then just wear this and then it would
kind of go through my cleavage a little
bit so I thought this would be a really
cute necklace and it comes with these
earrings which I'll probably never wear
but I mean it was super affordable
didn't even know it came with the
earrings but I thought this was really
cute but I also picked up this other
necklace also go Jane and it's kind of
similar it's goes around your neck and
then it has that long thing that's gonna
hang in between your Cleaves so you're
clean cleave so I would probably wear
these with a lower cut shirt and like a
flouse polly unbutton a little bit I
thought that would be really cute so
this I also picked up and I'm such a fan
of costume jewelry like 90% of all of my
jewelry is costume and really cheap and
some of it doesn't last that long like a
couple of the Rings they start turning
different colors but you know what
they're so cheap they're affordable so
if you can get a couple uses out of them
I think it's worth it I mean I'm sure
one day I'll appreciate finer jewelry
and probably maybe switch over to that
but for now costume jewelry is my
absolute favorite so the cheaper the
better know there pair of shoes that I
picked up that are just so fab
are these gold gladiator shoes okay so
they may look really weird and
disheveled and that's only because I
actually wore these on Valentine's Day
Brett and I just stayed in and he cooked
me dinner so I figured since we're gonna
be indoors why not wear whatever I want
so I ended up wearing actually a pink
romper and whoa let me get that so I
could show you guys this is the pink
romper that I was wearing I know a
couple of you guys were asking what it
was but it's just this baggy romper and
it has like lace detail at the bottom I
wore this with a gold belt and then I
paired it with these amazing little
sandals so it was such a cute outfit I
felt like a little fairy and it didn't
matter because it was warm inside our
house so we
we knew we weren't leaving so I figured
why not wear whatever I want and it
ended up being such a cute spring outfit
and I know I'll probably ends up wearing
it again but these shoes are literally
everything they look so good and
normally I'm not into stuff that Lakes
really high up my legs especially
because I'm really short so I don't like
anything that's gonna really cut me off
but I thought they looked so cute on
there really comfortable and I'm not
sure how much they were they're from a
website called pixie market but I love
these so they're so cute and I think
they're perfect for summertime or
springtime but the romper is also from
Shope oh and this romper that I'm
wearing right now is also from Shope oh
so you can get all of it 10% off with
the code I'm gonna say it's beauty Bible
but I'm not positive so definitely check
out my blog so I think for now that will
be it for my haul I hope it wasn't all
over the place and I hope I didn't
disappoint you because some of the stuff
we can't wear for a while now but like I
said I do have my vacation plan so I
have been buying a lot of spring stuff
but I love you guys so much I hope you
enjoyed this video let me know how you
guys like these halls and if you want
more of them and also comment below and
let me know what you'd like to see next
on my channel I love you guys so much
and until next time yes the beginning to
keep the world
