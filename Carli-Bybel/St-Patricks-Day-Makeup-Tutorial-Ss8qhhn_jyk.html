tutorial I'm going to show you how I got
this
st. Patrick's Day inspired makeup look
whether you're going to a parade or if
you're just going to a party and you
want to get festive why not make your
eye makeup match so if you like how my
makeup looks please keep watching and
I'll show you how I got this first I'm
going to be taking my Sonia Kashuk
concealer quad and applying the
concealer on my eyelid this is so the
makeup stays on all day long
then taking my ELF palette I'm going to
be using this white color and I'm going
to apply this on the inner thirds of my
eye and also underneath my brow bone
next taking this lime-green color I'm
going to be applying this on the inner
thirds of my eye
I'm then going to mix this lime green
color and this turquoise color to get
this pretty dark green color and apply
this on the outer part of my eye
next taking my Mac blending brush and
the lime-green color I'm going to be
applying this right in the crease of my
eye taking an angled brush and a black
color I'm then gonna be going over right
in the V of my eye just to emphasize the
V this is gonna make your eyes appear
larger and it's gonna give your eye more
depth
going back to my blending brush I'm then
gonna blend all these colors together
when you're doing this you want to make
sure you blend it very lightly that way
you don't take off all the shadow and it
looks very neat
taking my Bobby Brown gel liner and a
small brush I'm then gonna be lining my
upper lash line again like I've said in
previous videos if you do it in sections
it's a lot easier you start out with the
outer part of your eye and then work
your way into the middle
taking an angled brush and that same
lime-green color and then going to line
my lower lash line next taking some
green glitter you can apply this with
mac fix+ this is so the glitter sticks
to it and doesn't end up all over your
face you're then just going to apply
this right over the green line you just
sit on your lower lash line
he didn't want to apply your mascara or
false lashes at this time I'm using
L'Oreal telescopic mascara as I've used
in every single one of my other videos I
love this mascara it makes your
eyelashes so long
so that is how I got my st. Patrick's
Day inspired makeup look I hope that you
guys enjoy and thank you so much for
watching have a great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
