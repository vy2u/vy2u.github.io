today I'm going to be showing you a shoe
haul just in time for summer I have
found a bunch of amazing online websites
with the cutest shoes and I blame these
online websites for my shoe shopping
problem and I just wanted to show you
guys a couple of new shoes that I got
that I believe are still available all
on the website and I just want to talk
about a couple different websites that
I'm loving right now and yeah so if you
guys want to see some of my new summer
sandals please keep watching so if you
have been following my blog which I hope
you guys have all seen it I have
mentioned some of these different
websites on there so you might be
familiar with the names the first one
I'm going to talk about is Lola
Shoetique and I originally heard about
them through Instagram I saw them on the
popular page and as soon as I saw their
shoes I went right to their website and
I was pleasantly surprised to find that
everything is basically under $40 most
of the shoes are around 25 to 30 which
is just so crazy and it's kind of bad
for someone like me because why only buy
one if you can buy like four or five for
the price of one pair in another store
so sent me over a few pairs of shoes and
I did get a coupon code for you guys
which is going to be for five dollars
off your order and this has been live
for I think about two weeks so I'm sure
there's been another two weeks for that
and the first pair I want to show you
are just so amazing these are lace-up
sandals and they are like a pink color I
have not worn these yet but they sold
out so quickly and I think they
restocked them so I'm pretty sure she
still has them on the website but they
have the nice lace up detail which a lot
of the top designers have a lot of shoes
out like this and I notice these were
one of the nicest versions of those so I
love it it has a zip up back and lace up
front and I am a true size 8 in every
single shoe I wear there are exceptions
so if there are any exceptions with the
shoes that I do want to let you know but
their shoes run true to size so I am a
solid 8 and basically every single shoe
and I ordered all eight from them and
they were all perfect to size the second
pair from them I wore in a blog post
these are them and they're so cute love
obsessed and
I don't know if these are still sold out
on the website but I will check for you
guys I love the buckle and I love like
the edgy details to these I paired these
with that camo jacket so it's a more
like edgy look not so girly I absolutely
love these though and if you guys have
seen my music festival outfit hair and
makeup I had a shoes almost similar to
these ones but they were sold out on
every single website I could find so I
saw these and they're basically the same
as the other ones that I love they have
a little baby wedge on them so they are
super comfortable I wear these in place
of just like a black flip-flop if I'm
running to the mall or running some
errands and I just want to add a little
height to me I will put these on and
they literally are super comfortable and
they're cute they're just simple but
they're gonna give you a little bit of
height if you're a nugget like me
another pair I got we're also on my blog
these red pumps and I have these in
every color I have them in beige black
and white and now red and I just love
the classic low front and the little
heel they're really really really
comfortable I'm so used to wearing like
six-inch heels with high platforms just
because I have flat feet so I always
thought the best thing for your feet
were something with a higher platform so
it's not as much as the slant but then I
started wearing shoes with no platform
in the front and I swear it's like the
pressure goes into a different part of
my foot that I'm not used to so I guess
maybe it's not so bad for me but I am
loving these kind of heels right now the
last pair I want to show you from their
website I also haven't got to wear yet
but they're so cute and unlike anything
I have these ones are black with
different color straps and it's a nice
wedge heel so these are super cute I
would probably wear something all-black
with this and then bring out the colors
and the jewelry in my purse so I can't
wait to a pair of these with different
outfits I want to hear your feedback on
my blog post because I know my blog
doesn't get as many comments but do you
guys like what I've been doing where
I've been pairing the outfits and then
giving you guys direct links let me know
the next site we're going to move on to
is my
absolute favorite which is ASOS and if
you guys follow me basically everything
I buys from ASOS and what's really
awesome is they got a coupon code and
it's only for one week for only my
viewer because it is such a big website
they did only give me a coupon code for
one week but I really pleaded to get one
for you guys because they don't really
ever have sales on their website so I
got one for you guys for one week and
it's for 10% off so take advantage it's
up until Monday and then it's over with
and then I don't know if I'll be getting
another coupon again but I will
hopefully try my best the first ones I
literally got in the mail three days ago
I think so they definitely have to still
have them on the website but they're by
the brand River Island and there are
these beige buckle sandals like are
these the cutest things you've ever seen
they are so awesome I have no idea what
I'm going to wear with them yet but I
just love the whole Grecian look to it
they have the zipper up the back so you
don't actually have to unbuckle all the
buckles which is nice and I would think
these with like a pair of shorts and
maybe just a t-shirt something casual
would be really cute and it'd be a way
to kind of dress up a more casual outfit
these ones are a little bit more pricey
but I love them and I actually got them
with the discounts the next one's from
ASOS are just absolutely ridiculous when
I saw them I almost fainted this look at
these okay so these are basically me in
a nutshell I know most people either
love or hate my sense of fashion and
style but I just like something where if
I see it I would be like oh I love that
that's really cool and if it's just kind
of like oh that's cute I won't buy it so
if I see something and I get like
excited and I have like instant visions
of what I could wear with it and where I
would be wearing it so I saw these and
I'm so in love with them they have like
a blue lace print detail with spikes and
rhinestones all over them on both sides
when it came they were like packaged in
like 20 ounces of bubble wrap because
you don't want to ruin any of these but
yeah these are them and the
are amazing I'm obsessed if you don't
like them I'm sorry
they are very extreme but like I said I
do take my fashion to the extreme I
swear I just had the other shoe so I
can't find the other mates to this shoe
because I was just trying them on but
these ones are also from ASOS and these
ones are also funky I came across these
and I've never seen anything like them
so I had to get them I'm a huge fan of
wedges because again like I had said I
have flat feet so wearing wedges does
help a lot
these ones are super ginormous I grow
like seven maybe even eight inches in
these so when you're short and you get
super high heels believe me it's so much
fun because you can be like 6 foot tall
really fun so I love super super high
heels so again a little bit more funky
but they are super cute and I'm obsessed
the next shoes that I'm going to be
showing you guys are from a store called
Zara they do have an online store as
well but I got these in the actual store
and they're this beautiful color green
when I saw these I just pictured myself
super tan on an island somewhere I mean
obviously that's probably I'm having
anytime soon but for summertime I think
these are so so cute um Sarah is a
little bit more pricey these ones were
$89 so yeah they were a little bit more
pricey but if you're looking for a good
quality really cute shoe sarah has
awesome stuff so I know the new sneaker
wedge trend is either a hit or miss for
most people and I was not fond of them
at all at first and it wasn't until I
bought a pair with the velcro that I
actually really liked them I think the
ones with the laces are a little bit
more better they look more like sneakers
and it just doesn't really look right in
my opinion so I prefer the ones with the
big the big buckles and I have these
ones they are from a my club wear and
they just velcro all cost and you could
barely even tell that they're wedges and
I love them because they're super comfy
a and B they're also so inexpensive
a my club wear has awesome shoes if
you're looking for a lot of flat sandals
or even high
they have every single color and style
issue you can imagine and they are
really really low in price which is
awesome
and I had posted something a few maybe a
few weeks back about ami and a couple of
you are concerned about their customer
service so I will leave an email below
because I am in contact with one of the
owners of the site and he gave me his
email address and said if any my viewers
have any problems whatsoever that they
can email him and they'll take care of
you so that's really important I think
the biggest thing for me is customer
service and if I've received poor
customer service then I don't even
bother mentioning the brands or the
websites to you guys because I think you
should treat your customers as number
one that was just always my view on
things so they don't get back to you you
feel ignored then it gives you a bad
taste and yeah so we don't want that out
any other sites so I can back up every
single website that I talk about and
yeah if you like the wedges definitely
go check out AMI the final pair of shoes
I will be showing you guys today are
from Nine West and they are so cute
these are them and they have little
fringes on them I'm obsessed with
fringes like obsessed I got these over
Memorial Day and I got lucky because the
website was having a buy one get one
free sale so I got these half-price
because they are pretty expensive I
never owned Nine West Shoes before and I
didn't realize that they were a little
bit more pricey than normal but I did
get that good deal so when I saw these I
was like I have to get them they were
just so pretty and they can really go
with anything and I think they're
perfect for summertime okay well I'm
going to show you one more pair just one
seriously I could go on and on forever
but I don't want to bore you guys
because I don't even know if you guys
are obsessed with shoes as much as me
it's like a problem like I just love
looking at them I like them just hanging
around my room and I just like to stare
at them okay so the final last pair that
I'm talking about our new as well
they're my first pair of Gucci shoes I
actually don't own anything Gucci which
is funny because everyone had Gucci bags
in high school and everything but yeah
so I bought them for myself and they
were my first Gucci purchase and I
so in love with them they have this
patent buckle that goes around the ankle
and then they are the classic just low
front and a little bit of a heel and
they aren't extremely comfortable
because it is a pretty high heel and a
high slope but I just love how they look
and I wore them out about two weeks ago
and I lasted about four to five hours
and I was fine so these ones are so
amazing I posted a picture and some
people were like it looks like a house
the rest were ink lit which I can see
where you're coming from but these are
fabulous so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope it in for you and I mean I
have shoes for days so if you guys want
a bigger shoe collection or anything
like that let me know I want to be
listing every single link to where I got
every single pair of shoes so if you
guys are interested in any of them I
hope this helped I hope I introduce you
to some new amazing shoe websites and I
do apologize in advance for extra
spending this month on shoes it's like a
problem as soon as I know spring or
summer is coming I'm like I have no
sandals meanwhile I still had sandals
from last year but I was like no sandals

have a serious problem clearly so I love
