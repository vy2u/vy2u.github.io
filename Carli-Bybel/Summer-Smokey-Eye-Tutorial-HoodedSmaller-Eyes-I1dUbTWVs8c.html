taught me to be patient one more than I
have
so many lessons he has no hi everyone
thank you for watching so I wanted to
put together a video for you guys
because I've been looking through a lot
of comments and I notice a lot of people
have been requesting a makeup look for
someone with smaller eyes or more hooded
eyes and I know I do have pretty large
eyes so a lot of my looks maybe are
harder to follow along with because it
can't really come out the same way so I
wanted to go step by step and show you
my technique for performing a makeup
look on someone with smaller eyes as you
guys probably know I did do a lot of
freelance work for the past three or
four years so I have had all types of
clients I've had Asian clients who had
really hooded eyes and I've had people
with smaller sort of eyes I also had
people with huge eyes so for every type
of eye there are different techniques
that you would want to follow so if you
guys want to learn how to get this
summer smoky eye then please keep
watching and for anyone who doesn't have
the smaller eyes you still can follow
along and you could still do the same
look and you can either follow my
techniques because as you can see it
does look pretty on someone with bigger
eyes or you can do the same techniques
that I've used in basically all of my
previous videos so I hope you guys enjoy
and I will talk to you soon
prime my eyes I'm just going to be
taking a little bit of concealer and
applying it all over my eyelid you can
use an actual eyeshadow base but I
always just use my concealer because
it's easier
so mixing these two light pink colors
I'm going to be applying this right on
my eyelid underneath my brow and also in
my tear duct
so when you have smaller or hooded eyes
it doesn't make a lot of sense to do too
much work on your eyelid because when
you look straight ahead really all
you're gonna see are the lashes and
maybe a little bit of your eyelid so I
just like doing just a little bit of a
highlight more than the inner part of
the eye and then I would recommend doing
the darker parts on the outer part of
your lid and you're going to start with
your lid and you're going to start
blending it upwards so using this dark
gray color I'm gonna again start right
by my lash line and I'm gonna drag it
upwards when you're doing your makeup it
is a lot easier if you're looking
straight on into a mirror since I am
trying to film this I don't want to look
straight ahead because my mare will be
blocking the camera so again when you
are doing this it does help a lot if
you're looking directly in that way you
can see really what parts of your eye is
going to be showing and what parts are
going to be covered by the skin that's a
little hooded or something like that
take the dark color and start right at
the bottom of your eyelid
you're gonna very lightly drag this
color into about the center of your
eyelid and later on we're gonna take a
blending brush and blend the colors
together better so one recommendation I
have if you do have hooded eyes is to
take whatever your shadow color is and
kind of drag it out towards your eyebrow
this is going to extend your eye making
it appear longer and since you don't
really have the crease like I have right
here that will be seen when you're
looking straight ahead it kind of gives
you your own crease and it gives it more
shadow more depth so you're just going
to take up a little bit of that same
color on a blending brush and this one's
really fluffy so it's not going to get
any sharp lines it's going to give it a
nice smooth blended look and I'm going
to very lightly just drag that towards
my eyebrow
and then what I'm going to do is I just
take this lighter beige color and blend
that all throughout to lighten it a bit
when you are achieving this look you do
want to make sure that your eyes and the
motion of your shadow is going again in
a diagonal line from the side of your
eye up towards your eyebrow because you
don't want your eyes looking droopy if
you start the eye shadow a little bit
too far down it'll make your whole eyes
appear more droopy and it's not going to
give you the look that you want so again
you can either take a makeup wipe you
can use a foundation brush but or I just
use my finger usually and I just make
sure it's a straight upwards diagonal
line so we're now going to take the
darkest color and we're also going to be
applying it with the same technique
we're going to be starting at the end of
my eye and you're going to again want to
look straight into your mirror so you
can follow your natural eye shape and
just make sure it's shaded in all the
right places and we're just going to be
starting right at the bottom and then
just blending it upwards so before I do
any more techniques with the eye shadow
I like doing my eyeliner and then
applying my fake lashes just because
once the lashes in the eyeliner on it
kind of gives you the more distinct
shape of how your eyes gonna look at the
end so instead of doing the whole eyes
and applying it and then having to fix
it I just like doing this step next so
I'm just going to be using a liquid
liner and what you want to do is if you
have smaller or hooded eyes I usually
recommend to just do the outer corner of
your eye just to add a little bit of a
tail and what this does is it it will
extend your eye making it look a little
bit longer a little bit larger and you
can do the full eye but if you are going
to do the full eye I recommend just
doing a very thin line when it gets
closer to the inner part of your eye
because if it is too thick its gonna
absolutely make your eye look a hundred
times smaller so when you're applying
your eyeliner it's so important to be
looking straight ahead because when you
look down and if you want to apply a
little bit of a wing and you look back
up it's going to be either lost in the
crease or it could be a little bit
crooked so what you're going to want to
do is you're going to want to look
straight into your mirror and line it up
and very slowly just kind of take your
brush and slide it out so like I said I
am looking down because I need the
camera right in front of me but I'm
to be very slowly dragging out of line
you want to stay as close to your lash
line as possible and if you do have
smaller eyes you can see how I kind of
just let it fade into my natural lash
line and I didn't put any line in here
you can just leave it like that and then
you'll apply the lashes which will make
them darker or you can extend the line
to the tear duct
now when it comes to lashes I think this
is the most important step for someone
with smaller eyes because when you are
looking straight ahead usually you can
only really see the liner maybe a tiny
bit of lid and then the lashes are going
to be what sticks out the most so if you
have smaller lashes and you haven't used
false lashes I do highly recommend
trying them out they're super fun and
once you put on mascara over them they
don't feel as heavy they do really open
up your eyes and there are different
types they have more dramatic ones more
natural ones and ones I'm using are
called Istanbul and they're pretty
natural looking and I'm just going to be
applying some glue and putting them
right in my eyes it's always so
important to make sure the glue is just
a little bit dry before you put it on
otherwise it'll be sliding all over the
place and that is the one thing that I
realize is the biggest problem that most
people have is they put it on too early
and then it's so hard to get in the
right spot but if you just wait till
it's a little bit sticky it'll just kind
of plop right on and it'll be a lot
easier to adjust
then I'm gonna be taking my mascara my
L'Oreal telescopic the one that I always
use and we're just gonna put that right
underneath the fake lashes and it's
going to help blend your real ones in
with the false ones so the inner part of
your lower lash line you also want to
make sure is the lightest part so I'm
going to take this pretty blue color and
just apply it right under my lower lash
line and stop about halfway through
and then we're going to take that same
dark gray color and we're going to drag
it in from the outer part of our I once
I thought I'm just going to do one more
coat of mascara on my lower lashes so
now that all that is done you're just
going to want to make sure everything's
blended really nicely I'll usually just
take my blending brush and whatever's
left on it just kind of make sure
everything's all blended nice and you
can go back to that darker color and
again make sure your diagonal line is
pretty significant so that's going to
really open up your eyes so that is it
for the eyes I already do have my
foundation blush lipstick on but really
quickly I'll show you what I use for the
blush I'm just taking this light pink
color and I just smile and pop it on
once I do that I'll just blend it in
right here there's no sharp lines and
then for my lips I actually mixed the
lip tars that I had talked about in one
of my other videos I mixed the white
this like dark pink and then this peachy
color altogether and it gave me this
pink that I have right now in my lips so
I love for lipstick I love mixing all
different kinds of things and seeing
what comes out of it you can even use
eyeshadow with lip gloss over it to get
the right color so you don't have to go
out and spend thousands of dollars on
every color lipstick that's just a
little tip from me but that is how I
created my summer smokey look for
someone with smaller or hooded eyes I
hope you guys enjoyed and I will see you
guys soon the wit times you broke my
heart we've shared a lot of things
it helped me feel much less alone
especially when I fall apart I know I'm
still my father's son</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
