before I get into today's video I just
wanted to thank every single person who
entered my trees for change giveaway
there were well over a thousand entries
and some people planted more than one
tree so mission accomplished there are
new trees on the world and yes of course
not everybody won but we still did a
really good thing so I'm so excited and
I'm really happy about this whole
experience I also want to let you guys
know that I took 5 or 6 nights and I
spent hours on my couch watching every
single entry so if you go and you have a
little like on your video that's me
watching them but Brett was making fun
of me he was sitting there watching me
and I had my headphones in and I was
literally crying for like hours straight
just watching your videos it was so good
getting to hear your story and getting
to see your experience and then also
some of you guys had just the sweetest
things to say so I want to thank every
single one of you if it were up to me I
would have never been able to choose a
winner everyone was picked by random so
that's the only way I'd be able to do it
otherwise again I would have never been
able to pick anybody but thank you guys
so much because you all just filled me
with such joy and happiness like it's
really hard to explain so many of you
guys want to go check out some of the
entries you just type in trees hashtag
trees for change and you can go watch
some of them and I'm sure they'll bring
a smile to your face it's just really
cool how a lot of you understood the
point of the giveaway and you all kept
saying how it didn't matter if you
didn't win because we were doing
something beneficial so I just love this
idea and I can't wait to host another
huge giveaway for you guys so if you
didn't win don't worry my birthday's
coming up and guys always know that I do
a big giveaway on my birthday so with
all of that aside today I'm going to
show you how i got this makeup look
right here i think i'm going to be
titling this like a summer sunset makeup
look I saw a lot of people still
requesting more summer looks so this one
is for all of you guys so if you guys
want to learn how I got this look please
keep watching to start off this look I
am priming my eyes
with stay don't stray next to give it a
purple base I'm using this Milani eye
pencil and I'm just applying this all
over my eyelid and then blending it in
with my eye shadow brush using my morphe
35o palette I'm picking up this bright
purple color and I'm applying that on
the inner half of my eyelid then
grabbing a little bit of a darker purple
this is going to go right on the outer
half of my eye and you just want to make
sure they're blended in nicely
then with a small blending brush I'm
picking up the color sunset from my it
cosmetics palette and I'm applying this
right into the crease of my eye
with a larger blending brush and a
little bit more of that color sunset I'm
blending it a little higher into my
crease for lashes I'm using my Carlie
lash by velour I do have a 15 percent
off code which I will list below for you
guys and for this look I'm not gonna do
any upper eyeliner I'm going to line my
lower lash line with a white eyeliner to
really open up my eyes personally I
prefer eyeliner but I wanted to do
something a little bit different today
for you guys picking up this bronze
color I'm applying a thick line
underneath my eye I'm then going in with
this white champagne color and I'm
applying that right in the tear duct I'm
going to make sure it's blended into the
bronze color as well and then I'm
grabbing this darker purple color and
this is going on the outer third of my
eye and you're just going to slowly
blend all of the colors together and
with a little bit of the color sunset
I'm going right on the lower lash line
right under those three colors to give
it a little bit more like an ombre look
since I left all that powder on I'm just
brushing that off at this point and then
I'm picking up my NARS bronzer and
Laguna this is actually the first time
that I used it and I think it's a really
really nice matte bronzer I'm applying
this all over where you would normally
contour as well as on my neck to blend
everything in with my face
for blush I'm using by Mac it's called
breath of plum for highlighter I'm using
so Hollywood by anastasiya I'm applying
this on my cheekbones on the bridge of
my nose a little bit on my Cupid's bow
and then a little bit on my chin
for lip liner I'm using natural by NYX
at first I wasn't sure what color lift
to do with this eye look but I feel like
it's been a while since I've done a
really light nude color so for lipstick
I'm using the liquid lipsticks by Kat
Von D I'm mixing bow and arrow along
with the light nude one I'm not sure of
the name I feel like with this I look
you can do a bunch of different lip
color so feel free to get creative if
you guys want I also apologize that this
video took forever to get up there were
so many technical difficulties today
with me and Brett he was editing his
vlog on my computer and when he was
exporting finally everything got deleted
so it was just chaos
so this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I love you guys
so much and until next time I'll see you
guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
