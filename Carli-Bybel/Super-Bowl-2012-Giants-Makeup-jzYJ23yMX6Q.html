tutorial I'll be showing you how to get
this New York Giants inspired makeup
look if you're going to a Superbowl
party this weekend and you don't own a
Jersey you can always try this out
you're first going to be taking a
concealer and putting it on your eyelid
to help keep the eyeshadow on all night
using a small eyeshadow brush and this
bright blue color from my ELF palette
I'm going to be applying this on my
eyelid
I'm next taking a dark blue color from
my Maybelline eye studio quad and
applying this right on the outer V of my
eye it's easy to use small eyeshadow
brush when you're doing this that way
you can make sure it's really really
neat and then you go back with the
blending brush afterwards
then taking this pearly white color from
my ELF palette I'm going to be applying
this in the inner part of my eye as well
as my tear duct
next taking my Mac blending brush I'm
just gonna be blending the colors into
each other
picking up a little bit more of that
navy blue color I'm going to be blending
it a little bit higher than where it is
right now above my crease
then taking my angled brush and my Bobby
Brown gel liner to line my upper lash
line
using a small angled brush and that same
navy blue color I'm then going to be
lining my lower lash line
you now want to apply a mascara I'm
using L'Oreal telescopic and it's my
absolute favorite
for my lips I'm using lip venom it's a
lip plumper and it's just a clear gloss
I'm then using my Mac mineralize
skinfinish it's called gold deposit and
it just gives you a nice like bronze
glow this I'm just gonna be putting all
over my face and also my neck thank you
so much for watching I hope that this
helped a lot have a great day and I hope
everyone has an awesome time at their
Super Bowl party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
