everyone thank you for watching so this
video is gonna definitely be different
from something that I've ever done
before I got in contact with Stephanie
over at SM lx0 and meandher planned a
swap so what that is I didn't know what
this was either until she had told me
and actually watched she had one with
her and Ramona a few months ago so
basically how this works is you pick a
spending limit and you go out and get
some your favorite beauty products and
you ship it to the person's house so I
got my minds actually been in my room
for over a week now I was a little slow
getting mine to her but I've been
staring at this and I couldn't wait to
open it so I'm going to be opening it
now on camera and I guess we shall see
what is inside seriously I've been
texting her and I was like we need to
get these videos up because I keep this
thing has been sitting in my room I've
been staring at it I mean come on it's
like Christmas time when you see the
presents all wrapped and just sittin
wait like come on

funny how like everyone knows and I'm
like sickly obsessive penguins but like
can you just see this penguin is he the
cutest thing
hi okay thanks that's I coming down I
forgot that you guys are gonna be
watching this uh um so she sent me a
little note

tempted to buy two of everything to keep
one for myself I'm not even kidding with
some of the stuff I did that guitard
you like hands and things that I was
like alright this I have to remember
focus this is for her and not for me all
right let's see what up two-faced
sexy I'm assuming this is an eyeshadow
palette I've never had anything by Too

comes with and oh my gosh this is so
awesome okay so it's like three pallets

waterproof eyeliner in it thank you I'm

proven to increase lash volume by four
hundred thirty percent huh how did I not
know about this sooner this is really
cool you know what's actually so funny
it has kind of like a similar tip to the
l'oreal one that I have and then what's
even funnier is at the end there's like
a little Bowl
and the L'Oreal telescopic mascara that
I use let me see if I have this so they
have like two kinds of the L'Oreal
telescopic and I just bought this one it

lipsticks that is so weird oh my god get
