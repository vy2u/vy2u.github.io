the same man I was then I got off track
I made mistakes back slid my way into
that place where Souls get lost miles
get cross and the pain won't go away
everyone thank you for watching so today
I'm gonna be doing a little bit of a
different type of video I saw the tag
going around YouTube which is the what's
in my bag video and I know a lot of
people have done this and it's been done
millions of times but I have not done
anything like this so I figured why not
show you guys what's inside of my purse
really quickly before I start I just
wanted to share with you my earrings are
from ludora boutique they are handmade
in Brazil and I have 10% off their
website so I will post a link below and
this adorable shirt is from szabo skirt
which you guys probably already know I'm
obsessed with Saboo skirt so I'll also
link that below so the purse at the
moment that I've been using a lot is
this black fringe one and I'm obsessed
with fringes if you didn't know that
already and this I actually got from
ASOS I will put the link below and let's
see what's inside my barrack so when it
comes to being neat and organized I
really do try my best to stay neat and
organized but my purse and Mike are
always the first to get like super messy
and it just holds all kinds of receipts
and garbage but just like gum wrappers
and often the stuff so let's see what we
have in here so the first thing in my
bag Starbucks just kidding this really
wasn't in my bag but I just got
Starbucks and what I drink is nonfat
chai z' with light ice and I literally
drink it almost every single day so see
I swear no matter what I do or what bag
I have it's always like 80 pounds and is
so weird to list but look starting in
the pockets I have my cell phone I
always there's always like a little
pocket inside of the purses and I always
keep the most important things in there
because once it falls into the bottom
it's like a black hole and it's
impossible to find anything so I always
keep my phone in the little holder and I
also have some business cards in there
and these ones I designed myself pretty
cool so yeah when I was first starting
out with YouTube I had a bunch of
business cards made and I would just go
out around everywhere and just leave
them all over the
place like in the mall I would just put
a bunch on like tables or counters
anywhere and I don't know if they
actually lasted very long there because
I'm sure some people just throw them
away but I swear that really is a good
way to help spread your name and to help
get your name out there for other people
to find you and then in the zipper
pocket I have Tylenol extra strength on
me at all times because if you get a
headache or anything you're going to
have something for you
and another thing I also have in there
is my cuticle oil and if you guys saw my
nail tutorial I explained to you how I
have very dry cuticles so I love keeping
this with me because if I'm driving or
if I'm out and they start to hurt or if
they get a little dry I always will
really quickly just open it up and put
him on my cuticle a receipt this one's
from Sephora I was at in Menlo Park Mall
and you got 15 Jersey and went to
support and that's when I got my um the
lip tars that I was playing around with
in my past video so I got when I was
there I got the HD liquid foundation by
Makeup Forever
I got Smashbox BB cream that one was for
my mom and I got a new Laura Mercier
concealer because mine ran out and I
also got the left arm hundred and
seventy one dollars every time I go in
there I swear it's like you can't go in
there without leaving without spending
at least 100 dollars but I like to keep
all my receipts I used to just throw
them all out as soon as I would get them
but now for many reasons I keep all my
receipts in a box so I just whenever I
get them I throw em in my wallet or my
purse and then at the end of the week or
something like that I'll just pile them
all up and I throw him in a box for
future I need them for future use which
actually returned a pair of sunglasses
from like three months ago and I
thankfully had the receipt because
without the receipt I wouldn't have been
able to get my money back and I got all
my money back so it's good to save your
receipts I also have my sunglasses
receipts as I'm flying um oh okay
everything's like black these sunglasses
are my favorite these are the Gucci ones
that I always have on in my pictures
these ones and I know a lot of you are
asked
the serial number for them and I did
post them on my blog with a direct link
but for those of you who were wondering
they are Gucci and it's GG three five
four o /s and I got these from solstice
but honestly look online because they
have some websites where you can get
them for a cheaper I think solstice
actually marks up their prices but yeah
so check out different websites online I
mean you want to make sure that they are
authentic and that they are real but I
found these in a reddish color for about
100 dollars cheaper and I actually
wanted them so my keys my car keys so
when my old car that I had I had a
Nissan and it was just a push start so
one thing I never had was keychains or
keys or anything it was just like a
little fob and it would always be at the
bottom of my purse
and why I didn't care about it was
because as soon as you would walk up to
your car there's like a little button on
the door and you would push it and it
would just unlock your car and then it
was a push start to drive so I would
never have to actually dig through my
purse to try and find my keys so now
that I got my new Jeep I had to put some
biggest key chains on it because
otherwise it would just drive me crazy
every time I would go and try and find
my keys I swear every time I go anywhere
like if I'm trying to find my keys I
don't be searching for like an hour and
have a mini panic attack saying oh my
god I lost my keys but I always end up
finding them I have this cute little
keychain it's like a rhinestone penguin
my two baby cousins got it for me for
the holidays and then I have also this
little penguin
on it because okay and it's also big so
if I'm digging through my purse
obviously I'll find these easy always
have like ten packs of gum and they're
always empty my favorite gum is Orbitz
the sweet mint as you can tell this
one's empty and throw this out this one
has one left but one thing I always also
notice is I find gum at the bottom of my
purse all the time because these things
don't say shut they just fall right out
and then sometimes the wrappers come off
and then you have like gum at the bottom
your purse with like hair stuck to it
and it's disgusting but I love or become
addicted I have my new wallet it's funny
because I got this from ASOS as well and
when I ordered it I actually thought it
was a clutch so I thought it was going
to be a lot bigger but when it came I
actually needed a new wallet so it
worked out really well
I absolutely love this wall it's so cute
and um this is oh this is from yesterday
when I got my nails done never see it
keep that I'll show you my my license
picture it's funny because I have my old
license the one that expired from before
you turned 22 because they change okay
cuz they go from like this way to this
way and I just wanna show you how Orange
I look in this my old license picture
let's see if I could show you guys I
swear I think they like turned out the
saturation on those photos but if you
could see my little picture nice and
orange that's 17 year old me and then my
new one it looks like a mug shot I look
so angry I don't look happy to be taking
the picture but other than that and my
while I have some more business cards
and not much junk luckily because again
I just got it so it's nice and organized
for now another a really really long
receipt from Walgreens because there's
one literally right up the road and I'm
there every single day I swear the girl
at the register like knows me by name
now I'm always in there and she's like
off picking out some new makeup stay no
like yeah you know you know so I spent a
hundred and two dollars and I do have
like the bonus rewards that saved me
five dollars just by using it which is
pretty cool I mean I wish I want to see
it more but
this one is from no style from my mall
one of my favorite stores and they
actually have an online website which I
got told you guys about it's not as good
as in the store but pretty good ah wisps
Colgate whiffs if you guys ever tried
these yet I never tried them until Brett
bought them for me I keep them in my car
also they're so perfect because if you
have a little bit of bad breath or
coffee breath or anything all you do is
you put them in your mouth and you like
bite down and it's like a little gel I
don't know it's like a little ball of
toothpaste and you can like brush your
teeth really quick it gives you some
minty breath which is nice and it also
has a little kick at the end so you can
there's something stuck in your tooth
you can just grab it so I always keep
these with me because they have come in
handy Tom's always these are like my
lifesavers when I was younger I used to
get a lot more stomach ache so these
were an SS 'ti but I just keep them on
me just in case let's dummies feeling a
little sick battle of water ice I think
this bottled water is like two weeks old
it's kind of cool though it's like it's
like room temperature but I always have
a bottle of water with me because I'm a
fish and if I'm not drinking water all
day long I start sweating and I'm just
looking at this I'm sorry just wet
because my body needs it yeah I don't
know I swear like I drink a ridiculous
amount order it's a problem I also
always bring a spray with me this one is
called thallium I think I think that's
how you pronounce it this is what it
looks like this is like my favorite
perfume that I've been using for about
four months I actually got this when I
was down in Tennessee at one of the
perfume stands I wanted like a musky
kind of smell and this is so different
and I never heard of it before but when
ice melted it's like amazing so I don't
know where you could buy this I got it
again it like a the fragrance stands out
that they have in the mall and this is
what it looks like but this is one of my
favorite perfumes ever hmm
I have a claim check ticket this is from
I think this is from March back in March
oh my god sold when I we went to
Atlantic City for Brett's birthday I
surprised him with this suite and this
is definitely what that's from
and this definitely needs to go in the
garbage I also always have a little
makeup case with me I'm not sure where I
got this one I think it what came as
like one of those free gifts that you
get with like a purchase or something so
I always bring with me like my
necessities and I will tell you what
those are like literally no matter what
like if I'm going out or if I'm just
going to the mall or something there's
just like I don't feel safe I don't feel
like comes you're both I don't have
these with me I just feel incomplete so
what I always bring is this brush from
Mac because if I'm like getting a little
sweaty or a little oily I could just
really quickly like go like this and I
don't know it might be my head but I
feel like it just soaks up anything so I
always have this and I always always
always have my mascara because I have a
sick problem that I pick on the mascara
off so throughout the day I usually have
to reapply it
I have Neutrogena shine control blotting
sheets which are lifesavers in the
spring and summer time because if you
have oily skin it just takes away the
oil without removing your makeup so if
you've never seen these in action I will
show you because a little oily he just
cut out plot it wherever you think your
face is oily and it's good because it
doesn't remove your makeup so like if
you're I don't know a couple hours into
the day and you're looking oily instead
of like re applying more makeup to make
it more cakey you can just use these and
it gets the oil off usually there's
probably gonna be a lot more oil but I
don't know too oily today I also have my
Laura Mercier concealer which is always
with me as well because this is my
all-time favorite concealer and I also
always have bronzer my royal true match
one and then my Mac brought the final
two things that I always have are my lip
liner which is by
cosmetics the 21 that I use in basically
every single video and a chapstick these
chopsticks were actually sent to me from
a girl it's called Kona care and they're
really cool because there's all
different flavored ones so I always have
some sort of chap stick with me I have
kind of a chapstick obsession so that's
usually what I bring with me in my
makeup bag I mean if I have a more
dramatic look or there's different
specifics that I use that I would want
to bring or touch up during the day I
would also include that in that bag oh
look a PVA card from 2012 which is
expired and never worked for me anyway
I swear cops hate me every single time
I've been pulled over I've gotten a
ticket and usually it's because I'm
speeding like five over the speed limit
cuz Jersey cops are oh so friendly and
I'm always so nice and I'm oh hi officer
how are you and they're always so nice
back and then they come back with like
eight tickets so I don't know what it is
if someone like looks like me in high
school that made fun of them that they
absolutely hate me but yeah PPI cards
anymore for me so I'll just rip this one
up never mind a little rip why won't
this rip all right I'm gonna crumple
this one up because you did no good for
me score woke home with a piece of hair
yuck I always have a comb with me I
don't know if you guys watched I forget
which video is it maybe my current
favorites maybe no it was definitely way
before that but I bought this thing of
combs with 20 different sizes of combs
and it was like $2.99 and it's perfect
because it gave me like a hundred comb
so I literally like put a comb in each
of my purses so if I ever were to forget
one there's one hanging around in there
because if your hair is flat in the
middle a day or anything could just do a
little quick
tease and refresh everything and the
final yeah the rest is just gum at the
bottom my hair so the final thing that's
in my purse are at all time rubber bands
and a clip and the reason that this is
just all so important is because if
you're out and you get hot or you've got
sweaty and I don't know if there's any
other purpose but like
me I know when I go out and if I get
really hot and I don't have a hair tie
or clip I literally like have panic
attacks and one thing about me that if
you were friends with me you would know
this is if I'm out somewhere and there's
like a lot of people or I'm just I don't
know I'm not I'm going to say a lot of
people if I'm out anywhere and I don't
have a lot of water or if it's like
really crowded I get like really really
really hot and I get like heat attacks
as if I'm like going through menopause
so these always come in handy because
I'll just throw my hair up or clip it up
I always keep the hair tie clicked onto
the clip so that way I don't want to dig
through my bag if I am looking for it so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
something a little bit different I know
everyone has been requesting a fitness
video and I promise you I'm not ignoring
you I have so many things in the works
