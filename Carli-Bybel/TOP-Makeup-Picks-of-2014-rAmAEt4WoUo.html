welcome to 2015
can't believe it's here I swear I have
not left my couch for the past three
days I've been super lazy so I haven't
been productive yet in this new year so
today I'm finally getting back to
filming and back into the swing of
things I wanted to just go through
basically all of my beauty favorites
that I was obsessed with the past year
and then I personally recommend for you
guys so I'm gonna do it by category and
just basically talk about some of my
favorites out of each category so you
guys want to hear some of my favorite
products from 2014 please keep watching
so the way I'm gonna do this is so I
don't forget any of my favorites I'm
gonna basically go through each product
as if I were doing my own makeup so I'm
gonna start out with primers my number
one all-time favorite primer for 2014
was definitely my Smashbox photo-finish
color correcting primer and I'll show
you guys our close-up but it's already
empty and this is my second one that I
use for the year so this was definitely
my number one favorite I would say about
a month ago I picked up another one by
Smashbox the photo finish pore
minimizing primer and this one is
awesome I didn't want to restock this
one yet because I figured let me try a
different one they have about eight
different types of primers but this one
is the newest and I really noticed that
it blurs out your pores
so if you guys have tried the I guess I
don't know if it's L'Oreal miracle blur
or Revlon one of those they have them in
the drugstore
I guess it's basically the same idea
whatever they put in it it kind of just
mattifies your face and just makes it
look flawless so this one I've been
loving lately but my all-time favorite
would definitely be the color correcting
primary next I'm gonna move on to
foundations for the first half of 2014
my all-time favorite was the Make Up For
Ever HD foundation this one basically
was the only one that I used I have it
in about 4 color so whether I was tan
with our house pail I would just mix
them together and that was my go-to
foundation it wasn't until six maybe
months ago I found the Chanel perfection
Lumiere and this has been my only one
that I used whether it be for a natural
daytime look or a night out look this is
just the one that I like to grab the
most it gives you a flawless complexion
but without making you feel cakey so
these two are a bit more pricey but if
you guys are makeup artist or you're
doing your makeup all the time and you
want a really professional flawless face
I recommend spending a little bit more
on the foundations because that's the
base for your entire face so I love
these two I do have a favorite from the
drugstore from the past year which is
the L'Oreal magic nude liquid powder
foundation it's very very light but I
recommend shaking it a lot before you
use it that's one thing that I noticed
people were commenting on my video when
I had use this foundation let me talk
about the colors that I use for the
Chanel foundation I have thirty forty
and seventy and I mean it's pretty
self-explanatory if I'm a little bit
tanner use a darker one if I'm
in-between I just mix them together so I
do have this chanel and three and then
the makeup forever I have one 55 and I
have one 28 and then one 27 and for the
L'Oreal magic nude I have it in 320 and
330 which the 330 one's a lot darker so
I tend to use the 320 when I'm using
those and then I have one more product
that I want to talk about that I've been
obsessed with it is by million dollar
tan the shade upgrade dark foundation
booster you guys have probably seen me
use this in any tutorial where I
actually had a spray tan or I look tan
sometimes if you guys don't want to buy
ten of every foundation or in my case
three of every foundation you can just
use this and mix it in with your
foundation so all you do is put equal
parts foundation with the foundation
booster and it's gonna really darken up
your face so this is what I highly
recommend if you guys don't really want
to go out and spend that much money on
that many foundations if you guys are
just kind of starting out this I have a
15 percent off code which I will so that
is basically it for foundations
I have a whole drawer full of
foundations but I don't know for 2014
these were really the only ones that
made an impact so to say oh wait
actually no what am I saying I have one
more it's not a foundation it's a BB
cream this one's also by Smashbox this
one is in the shade light/medium i also
have it in light and medium so they have
light medium and light medium that makes
any sense but this is the best BB cream
that i have i've tried so many and this
one just is so lightweight but it gives
such great coverage so summertime or
when the weather's a little bit warmer
this is the only thing that i will use
on my face so now moving on to
concealers i would have to say my number
one for 2014 would be my Laura Mercier
secret camouflage and sc3 I've used this
so much this is probably my third one
that I've used not just in the past year
it's been a favorite for a while now I
absolutely love that one another one
that I'm loving that I actually never
tried up until a couple months ago was
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer the first
couple times I used it it creased like
really bad under my eyes for some reason
but if you set it with the right powder
it does give you a really nice finish
under your eyes so I love the pro
longwear I have it in NC 15 and NC 20 my
NC 21 I brought to Atlantic City with me
and as I was getting ready to fell and
it shattered on the floor and it was so
upsetting but it comes in like a glass
okay so be careful when you're using
this so the next concealer you can find
right in your drugstore it's the
Maybelline a dark circle eraser
concealer this one is in the color light
and it comes with this cute little fuzzy
thing on top so it makes it a lot easier
to apply your concealer but this is such
a great concealer and for the price you
can't beat that whenever I friends or
family members text me about like what
concealer should I pick up at the
drugstore this is the number one one
that I recommend so Adrienne concealer
has my stamp of approval so next I have
the lift concealer by Make Up For Ever
in the color 3 this I'd love to use
right underneath my eyes same place
where I would use my Pro Longwear
concealer so this one is
liquid concealer as well so if you guys
are using a more liquid concealer make
sure you're setting it with some sort of
powder whether it's loose powder or just
regular powder because if you leave it
super creamy it can move all over the
place and so I decrease after a few
hours and we don't want that happening
so those are the three liquid ones and
oh there's one more which I like to use
more as a highlight is the pro conceal
my la girl
and this one's creamy beige and then I
have the same by la girl pro conceal in
the color beautiful bronze and I love
using these for a highlighter and a
contour color they're very lightweight
so they don't feel heavy on your face
and for me that's the biggest thing I
hate when it's like super cakey after a
while under my eyes and these are so
thin and so lightweight yet give a lot
of coverage that's why I absolutely love
these another cream concealer that I
love is by makeup forever
this is a darker palette this is to
contour I love that it has the orange
shade in it because I love to apply it
underneath my eyes before my foundation
I don't do this every day but sometimes
when I wake up and I have like green
blueish veins under my eyes the orange
is great to do underneath and it kind of
just cancels it out so I do the orange
concealer under my eye then my
foundation and then the regular
concealer over it and it really helps
keep it nice all day long sin under
those veins or anything come popping
through the makeup and then of course I
have to add in my Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour kit probably the products
of 2014 for so many different people
such great powders and when they came
out that contour book I literally was in
heaven I haven't even used it it's been
sitting in my draw because just like too
perfect so I just use the six colors
that go in this kit for now but I love
their powders they're very lightweight
they're great for a natural look or if
you wanted something even more dramatic
so depending on what kind of look you
can really build on them so definitely
love these as well next moving on to
eyeshadows this was a little harder for
me because I don't know there's some
times where I'll just grab random shades
and play around I'd like to try a
million different things but I'm gonna
go with the most used of 2014 when I got
this Too Faced cat eyes palette I swear
didn't use anything else for so long
just because it has the brown shades in
here the lighter shades and one of my
favorite go-to looks whether it be for
my black cause whether it be if I'm
running errands or if I'm just going out
with my friends I always love to do just
like a brown smokey eye nothing too
crazy but subtle whatever you can add on
to it and that's why I love this palette
than most I'm not exactly sure how much
it goes for but it has the black shade
it has two Brown shades and then it has
like the nude shades that you can use it
does also have purple and a light blue
which I have tried out but for the
longest pinched me uh-hum but anyway for
the longest time I was using this so
when I was looking through my draw of
pallets on what to show you guys this
was definitely one that popped out as
one of my favorites for 2014 another
favorite that I got from the drugstore
is the nude palette by Maybelline and
these are awesome
I love all the Browns I love them at the
shimmer basically every single color in
here I think is perfect I don't know I
love sticking with neutral shades so I'm
gonna be wrong I love the times where I
can play with rhinestones and colors and
all that stuff that's so much fun as
well but for an everyday daily use type
of thing this palette is super
affordable and I definitely recommend it
for you guys another favorite palette
was the wild child palette by BH and
it's all the baked mineral shadows they
have the galaxy chic palette I'm not
sure if I started using that in 2013 so
I'm not that's why I haven't included it
in this but I love the BH mineral baked
shadows if you dip your brush in fix+ or
eyedrops or something like that and
really get it wet before you dip it in
the pigment of these shadows are just so
amazing and for the price you really
can't beat that I swear I will always
forever love BH Cosmetics it was one of
the first companies that I used to buy
from when I was still freelancing so I
just love their company I love that you
can really try stuff out and it's
affordable for most people so that is
another favorite as far as Mac pigments
the vanilla pigment is definitely my
most used pigment and
every single payment that I have it's
great because you can use it for a
million different things you can use it
to highlight you can use it for
eyeshadow you can use it for just
basically anything it's such a great
color and I think it looks great on
every skin tone so if you guys are in
the market for a Mac pigment if you
don't have Anila you need this one in
your life I promise you
and then for eyeliner my favorite of
2014 is definitely the wicked gel liner
by Sigma sure you guys could have
guessed it considering it's basically
the only one I ever use in my videos but
I just love the Sigma gel liners they
are my favorite and this is probably the
second one that I went through this year
so so next I'm gonna talk about my
favorite brow products my number one
hands-down for ever now I'm not even
just 2014 has been the brow bar to go by
whitening lightning or Gerard cosmetics
the same company basically so they come
in two shades this is the darker shade
and then they come in a lighter one with
blonde and like a lighter brown I
personally like the lighter one if I
want to use the lighter color for like a
contour color because it's the most
perfect matte shade but this one has the
really dark shade and then I guess like
more of a reddish shade and this is the
one that I use every single day like I'm
obsessed with at the beginning of 2014
though I was using the anastasi eye
beverly hills dipbrow pomade in dark
brown so this was probably my favorite
in the beginning of the year but after a
while I just I don't know I just was
making my eyebrows too thick for a while
I personally like them how they are now
a little bit thinner a little bit more
natural and I think with the pomade it's
easy to get taken away with them and
just draw them a little too dark throw
them a little too thick so the powder
it's really natural and it's really easy
way to just kind of fill them in and
make them look as best as possible
another favorite for brows is the clear
brow gel by anastasiya it never gets
clumpy you can use it not just for your
brows not just for clear mascara but
also firms like hair gel if you want to
just get rid of some of the flyaways
this is empty and I'm so upset because I
need to go buy a new one like yesterday
but this was definitely one of my
all-time favorite brow gels some of
that I've tried in the past they get
like clumpy or they leave like brown
marks in them if it's colored so I
prefer the clear brow gel to just kind
of hold your brows up and in place and
yeah next I'm going to talk about my top
highlighters for the year
the ones that I use the most I swear
this year was all about highlighters for
me I was never really big on them and
after trying them out and playing around
with them they're just to die for I
don't know how I live without them I
think my first highlighter that I
actually got was Becca opal I'm pretty
sure but if you guys haven't seen it
it's just so beautiful it's so pigmented
I absolutely love this one this is
definitely one of my most used a cheaper
alternative to the Becca I'm not gonna
open it because it actually broke is the
mary lou manizer by the balm which is a
great highlighter a great alternative to
the becca that's basically the exact
same champagne color another favorite is
from a new brand this year which is
artist Couture by angel merino or Mac
Daddy he's such a sweetheart I
absolutely love him and I love his
products they are so fun I'm actually
wearing the color conceded right now on
my cheeks and look at it glow but I love
his powders they are super pigmented and
the last but not least I have Mac
whisper guilt which i think was one of
the favorites of the year I spent way
too much money on e-bay to pick this bad
boy up and I absolutely love it but I do
have an exact duplicate which I
recommend it I think almost a year ago
in my video which is the Kiko eyeshadow
in 208 and it's the water shadow and
it's literally the exact same color it's
used for an eyeshadow but you can use it
to highlight as well so if you guys are
in the market for this limited-edition
highlighter that nobody can get their
hands on
try the Kiko shadow you will thank me
it's basically the exact same color so
as far as blushes this was probably my
hardest category because I tend to try a
new one almost every time so one of my
main things for 2014 was I was in the
tribe
new products so it was hard to kind of
pick my absolute favorites because I was
always kind of just trying new ones
trying to find my favorites but I would
have to say my overall go-to can't go
wrong blush palette would be my 10 color
palette from BH I actually just got a
new one because mine was a little bit
broken and basically empty but seriously
if you guys are looking for every shade
of blush and you don't want to spend a
lot of money again BH is amazing
they're pigmented they're all in one
palette so if you're going away or
you're traveling it's so much easier to
just pack this as opposed to a bunch of
little ones so this definitely has to be
my favorite blush of 2014 okay so moving
on to lips I never really was in to
trying different lip pencils I'm gonna
tell you this year I've been trying new
things I've been branching out more and
I would have to say I barely used
Jordana 20 of this year and if you guys
have been following me for the past
three years I've been on YouTube you
would know that that was my only one
that I ever used in like every single
tutorial and I just haven't used it in
so long and I think it's because I
literally put it on the furthest area of
my room so I don't just go grab that one
every single time I do have three
favorites that happen to all be from Mac
but they are just the ones that I use
the most and they're my absolute
favorites at the moment they're all
different in their own way oak is
actually what I'm wearing right now it's
a beautiful light brownish nude color
the color boldly bare is like a perfect
like pinkish nude and the color whirl is
I believe what kylie jenner used and it
like took over the entire makeup
industry and I understand why because
it's just the most perfect color and
matches your lips so if you want to try
and make them look bigger this is the
best one to use for that
as far as lipsticks I have so many
favorite lipsticks I could literally sit
here for an hour talking about lipsticks
but this video is probably long enough
as is because I'm mentioning so many
different products but I would have to
say my favorite Mac one has been velvet
teddy
I also love myth that I love pure Zen a
nother favorite are the Jurong cosmetics
lipsticks they came out this year and
they are amazing the nude one is
definitely one of my all-time favorites
it's the one that I use all the time I
also love the color buttercup and I love
fire engine
I love the cherry cordial that's how you
pronounce it it's like a deep dark color
so I love that one
I love the Wet n Wild 902 C it's very
similar to the velvet teddy for those of
you guys maybe looking for a similar
look but you don't want to spend the
money another favorite is the hourglass
nude number one which I use I believe in
my last tutorial but I love this wine a
for 2014 they come in a few different
chains the only ones that I have from
the hourglass collection are number one
and number two number two is more of a
nude we're number one is more of like a
pinky nude so this one is amazing and
one of my favorites for summer was my
dose of colors in the color coy which is
just the best orange color and it's so
pigmented and I absolutely love that and
for lip glosses i think the only lip
glosses that i use although I have many
are my whitening lightening / Gerard
cosmetics lip glosses I got this cool
holder to hold them all in but this is
every shade that it comes in they are so
pigmented you don't need lipsticks with
them I think okay let me go through them
and tell you my favorites my absolute
favorite is nude like hands down
probably when I use the most
I love shimmer of hope I love cocoa bean
I love coral crazy
plum crazy pink Tierra is a beautiful
pink one I love the color suction it's a
really dark shade so they're all amazing
colors but they're probably the only
ones that I go for just because I'm so
comfortable with that I'm so familiar
with them and they're so pigmented I
don't really need to mix ten colors
together to try
get the right color so next I'm going to
talk about mascara and lashes
the only mascara that I feel like I've
ever loved and used for three four five
maybe even six years now is the L'Oreal
telescopic just one of my all-time
favorites I'll always love it the only
one I've used I've tried so many
different other ones that they just
never get my natural lashes as long as
this one does so this is my number one
no shocker there and of course my
all-time favorite lashes for 2014 are my
new Carlie lash guys they've no idea how
excited I am about this and seeing only
the guys in them so exciting everyone
looks so beautiful I can't believe that
they are finally on sale they are on
backorder till January 9 then they will
be should be on again but you can still
order them in the meantime they are just
the perfect wispy lashes they're a
little bit dramatic a little bit natural
you can really dress them up anything
but they are amazing and of course
they're my favorite for the year so that
is it for lashes so last but not least
I'm going to talk about what my favorite
makeup brushes and my makeup tools on
how to apply my makeup so my number one
favorite for 2014 was definitely the
Beauty Blender
I never knew how to work it right and
tell 2014 I was using it dry I hated it
it made my skin dry and understand why
everyone was loving it until I put it
under a faucet rang it out and it's
perfect when it's damp so if you guys
haven't tried a damp try it it's amazing
they also came out with their little
baby ones this year which is great for
applying concealer under your eyes I
absolutely love these I use this today
to apply my makeup and as far as brushes
I think my number one favorite are
between Mac and Sigma Sigma has really
taken over for me it's basically all
Sigma that I have a few favorites from
Mac so I'm just gonna pick out my
favorite ones that I use all the time
that if you guys aren't in the market
for good brushes I'll play the number so
it could be a little bit easier for you
guys my favorite favorite favorite
payment favorite foundation brush is the
Sigma f50 brush and this is the dual
fiber brush don't mind my brushes there
we're dirty and I'm gonna clean them
after this video because it's been a
while but yeah so that's my all-time
favorite foundation brush hands-down the
best I recommend it to everybody you
can't go wrong with that brush another
duo fiber brush that I love is by Mac
and this one's old so I can't even see
the number hold on let me see
130 133 130 so this is the Mac 130 brush
I like using this for underneath my eyes
for concealer or just to kind of blend
it in this is one of my favorites I also
use this to contour these too also by
Sigma they're amazing
this small contour brush and fo5 is
probably my most used brush the tapered
highlighter brush which is f-35 is
another one of my favorites I love this
for applying if I'm using the associate
kit or basically any type of under-eye
powder I love just topping it on
underneath my eyes it has like a pointed
top to it so it's great for reaching
like right in here and yeah you get the
gist of it but yeah these two are
amazing this brush I've been loving
recently it's by morphe and it's M 402
and I've been liking this for bronzer
and blush it's super big and fluffy so
it doesn't just put like a bunch of
product in one spot it kind of just
distributes it evenly so you could just
kind of Pat and it evenly makes a nice
look and it looks nice and blended
without having to do too much work there
so these are definitely my other
favorites the Sigma e45 which is a
little bit of a pointed tip blending
brush I love this to contour my nose I
love this for under my eyes I also love
it if I'm trying to create a deep outer
V to really emphasize the look it's just
perfect and it gives you a lot of
control so this is definitely one I
can't live without literally the one
brush that I always will need for my
eyes I don't
I get every single brush thrown away
this is the one that I need for my eyes
it's the F F it's the e-40 and it's the
tapered blending it's super fluffy and
big so this is great to apply any crease
color I love this brush this is
definitely my most used brush recommend
it for any of you guys out there another
brush that you guys absolutely need for
a smoky eye or for any type of eye
shadow look is the e25 brush cest with
this one to apply my eyeshadow on my lid
I always love using the Sigma F 70 and
it's actually a concealer brush but it's
perfect for eyeshadow it's great for
applying any color and shade anything
I'm just rambling at this point light is
killing me in my eyes
starting to sweat okay anyway for
eyeliner the best brush is the new one
by Sigma it's the eo6 brush amazing for
my brows the only brush that I use and
there's no name or number on it because
it looks like it's been washed out but I
believe this one is from the Anastasia
Beverly Hills collection of brushes so I
will find them all and link them for you
guys my favorite concealer brush is the
Mac 287 brush and the other brush that I
can't live without is the Sigma pencil
brush II thirty and this I am obsessed
with I also use this sometimes to
contour my nose I sometimes used to
underneath my Apple I actually always
use it underneath my eyes to give a nice
blended faded look so yeah that is
basically it I believe I'm sure I'm
missing a bunch of products that I
didn't even think of off the top of my
head but those are basically my top
beauty picks of 2014 they're ones that I
am obsessed with the ones that I use the
most for the year and yeah I don't
really know what else to say other than
