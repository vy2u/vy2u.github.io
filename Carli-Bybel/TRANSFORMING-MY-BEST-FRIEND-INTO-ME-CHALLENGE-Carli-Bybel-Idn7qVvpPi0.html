hi everybody thank you for watching what
I saw nikkietutorials do this video
where she transformed her best friend
into her and as soon as I thought I
kissed her the picture I look we're
doing this I saw it I was like I need to
be apart yeah me and mu met when we were
in fifth grade our systems were actually
best friends and her service leaping
over our house one night and no came to
pick her up the next morning like with
her mom my mom made me go to the door so
they were telex working and so she rang
the doorbell and I literally answered in
like my nightgown and like my prism my
hair on her head surely curlier and like
out to me for like I don't know to
business yeah maybe
and then later on that night we went on
a one-semester remember names and we
were like and ever since I've been best
friends so that's our story
you want to tell them how they penises
missing no you're involved yes you're
walking just being a bunch of weirdos
because we will just take laps around
them all over like in middle school and
I think he saw like a stupid shirt I'm a
family guy just something about like you
know your silly little moo-cow and then
we simply there's a little moo-cow and
then I just stuck never called her
Nicole like even just saying it I know
there's not not my your name is nothing
just recently we got matching tattoos
Michael my finger and hers is right
there and you can see it but it says
Millie and one day I post a picture of
us on Instagram and somebody actually
was like do you know that Miller you
means beautiful and such and we really
had no idea like we just literally made
up the loop on that t-shirt so ever
since let me kind of just knew that
meant beautiful another language so
we're both kind of like one tattoo
we do and we went that day we kind of
like wrote it out and we both ended up
getting branded for like you're a white
girl if I go a dollar so if you guys
want to see how we got this plus keeps
keep off today to start off today's look
I'm using the Krylon ultra based primer
and I'm just applying this all over her
face
then for foundation I'm using the Fionna
styles foundation and number five she's
a little bit more of a Pinker undertone
than I do so I ends up using a more cool
tone cream contour so if the foundation
isn't perfect don't worry there's going
to be a bunch of other steps I've been
using the foundation a lot so I wanted
to use it on her as well
so next I'm grabbing this cool tone
cream contour palette and I'm applying
of this dark brown shade on the sides of
her nose also on her cheeks on her
forehead her jawline and underneath her
chin it has been a really long time
since I did her makeup so I wanted to go
all-out for a today's look and do kind
of like my signature full face cream
contour and highlight routine next I'm
grabbing this creamy concealer and I'm
applying that right underneath her eyes
and then I'm grabbing the shape tape and
the color medium and I'm applying it
down the sides of her nose so I like to
draw everything out before I start
blending especially if I'm doing makeup
on other people but also on myself
so first I'm blending in the creamy
concealer with my Beauty Blender and
then I'm moving on to this morphe duo
fiber brush to blend in all of the cream
contour and then I'm going to start
blending in the nose contour
then I'm just wiping whatever concealer
is left on my Beauty Blender onto her
eyelid and just set under her eyes I'm
using the Kat Von D setting powder and
I'm just going to have her look up blend
out all of the creases and then apply
the powder I like to apply the powder up
against the harsh lines that way when I
blend out the powder it kind of diffuses
it a little bit I'm also going to be
applying this a little bit on her
forehead and then I'm going in on her
brows so I wanted to try and make them
as close to my shape as possible hers
are a little thicker than mine so after
I shape them I go in with a little bit
of a concealer to kind of make them
appear Center from far away
I'm using the Anastasia brow Wiz and
then I'm using the brow powder in Ebony
something a little bit of that creamy
concealer and like a flat brush and I'm
just going to give it the illusion of a
center brow to make it look more like my
shape to set the cream contour I'm using
the Kat Von D shade and light palette
I'm using the lighter grey or tone for
the sides of her nose and I'm going over
everywhere that I use the dark cream
contour with the two lighter shades in
the contour kit
I'm grabbing the k'kaw contour kit in
dark and I'm just going to be lining the
outside of her lips so I'm just going to
blend that in with my Beauty Blender and
you'll see it'll just add some shadow
around her lips which in turn will make
them look a little bit larger next I am
using the Kat Von D foundation powder
underneath her eyes and up on the sides
of her nose and that's just going to
really brighten her under-eye moving on
to eyes I'm picking up the light brown
matte shade from my palette and I'm
applying that with a large blending
brush rain's her crease so for this look
I wanted to make her eyelids look a
little bit larger so I'm applying the
shadow first and then I'm going in with
a creamy concealer and I'm going to draw
right above where her eyelid actually is
just to make it appear a little bit
larger so for this eye look I do use a
few tricks that will make your eyes
appear larger so if you want to follow
along
hopefully these checks will work for you
guys as well I'm grabbing the light
highlight color from my palette and I'm
applying this all over her eyelid I'm
then grabbing a darkest matte Brown
shadow and I am applying this on the
outer V of her eye so as you can see
when she opens up her eyes the one on
the left looks a lot larger because of
the placement of the shadows so when you
want to make your eyes appear larger you
want to put the lighter color above your
crease and you also want to keep the
outer V a little bit higher as well and
that'll just give it the illusion of a
larger eye for eyeliner I'm using this
one by Physicians Formula and for lashes
I'm using my favorite lashes which are
the WSP lashes by Christina for mascara
I'm using this one by Tarte and then I'm
going back in with that same matte light
brown shadow and I'm just going to mix
that from the outer V into the crease a
little bit just to have it blend a
little bit better then I'm applying a
little bit more setting powder under her
eyes so that way when I do her bottom
mascara it doesn't get all underneath
her eye it's just a little trick that I
always like to do especially if you have
longer bottom lashes I'm using the same
color that I use on her eyelid to
highlight her nose literally my favorite
highlight right now is the perfect light
gold shade and then for blush I'm using
my favorite blush which is from the BH
nude blush palette
I'm going to give her some rosy cheeks
for lips I'm using a chi liner by
colour-pop and for lipstick I'm using
Time Square liquid lipstick also by
color pop it's one of my personal
favorite just going to show off the look
I'm using the cover FX setting spray and
I'm going to apply a little bit of
highlighter on her chest and her
shoulders because we both decided to
wear a black tube top in today's look
and I know normally I don't wear
highlighter on my cheeks but she really
wanted a highlighter and I applied a
little bit today as well so that is the
final look I applied some Bellamy hair
extensions the 24 inch ones into her
hair and obviously it's a little bit
darker than her natural hair so I'm
using this brown spray that is actually
for your roots if you have like gray
roots or lighter roots and I just
sprayed her hair and I only did like the
front parts whatever was showing just to
get that overall look I use basically
the entire can but Wow good good
damn honey
oh my god we're so this is the final
result this is so much fun thank you so
much for doing this way for meeting my
face I got all the new tricks on my face
O'Malley I know I feel like we should go
somewhere now no I need to go out and
show this off I know I will get like
dinner and drinks or something shed
maybe maybe someone will think we're
twins I know I think we did a pretty
good job he looks great I feel great and
she was saying once entire hair down
tomorrow right now I'm gonna go medium
brown like this piece of still brown
could see it yeah like you couldn't have
done it today
so I have a frightening as all my little
na - eww - those are great well I hope
