today I'm back and I'm in a new location
this is the first time that I'm filming
and when you closet for you guys so I'm
super excited so since it's been so long
since I have filmed a fashion haul I
figured today I was filming in my closet
and also show you guys a Tryon home
because I've never done one of those and
I feel like every time I do a fashion
haul you guys are always suggesting that
so if you guys want to see what I picked
up recently then please keep watching so
the first item that I wanted to show you
guys today is this white sweater and
every time I handed up my screen it's
super dark so the reason that I wanted
to get this sweater is it has these
beautiful ruffle sleeves so for the fall
and the winter time I go a little crazy
overboard with like sweaters sweatshirts
sweatpants because I would say like 90
percent of the time that's what I'm
wearing and I would probably pair this
with like a pair of light blue jeans or
like ripped jeans you can also do like
black jeans or leggings really depends
on whatever type of look you're going
for so next up I have these embellished
sweat pants they're amazing they came
out and a couple different colors I
think anything was embellished when I've
been obsessed with for a couple of years
now
and like I was saying earlier I just
like live in sweatpants so when I sell
like the mixture of the two I got really
excited and I went a little crazy and I
bought them in gray beige and also like
a khaki green color they are a little
bit pricey but I picked these up during
the water Friday sale that they had
which was like 30% off which was nice
the way that the model for them to wear
them like around her hip
then they kind of like sag a little bit
for me since I'm like super short I
don't like anything like to stay on the
crotch because I'm really short legs so
it just makes my torso looks super long
and my legs look really short so when I
wear these I wear them high waisted and
then they have like a drawstring up here
so you can tie in super tight and then
they fit tight around your waist so
really all about preference whether you
want to wear high waisted or low waisted
but they're so next up I have this grey
baggy sweater it's very like loose and
baggy
I love sweaters like this with like the
open front because you can just throw
them on over anything whether you're
being really lazy and you're still in
your pajamas and just want a sweater or
if you're going out somewhere and you
don't have a jackets where you could
throw this on as well it could be
dressed down or dressed up but I would
most likely wear this like I said with
like leggings and like boots and just
kind of throw this on over it so next I
have these knit leggings I recently did
a blog because I think it was on Friday
and I wore these in a nude color I got
them in black nude gray and I think I
got them in one other color but they're
super comfy and I love like the ribbed
knit detail on them their high waist and
they are not see-through whatsoever so
next up I have this charcoal velvet
sweatshirt it's a crop sweatshirt with
like bows on the sleeves as you guys
know I'm sure velvet is really really in
this year so you'll see it on everything
that you go on but I really really love
the details of this it was just plain
and didn't have the bows on it I
probably would have just looked past it
but I just thought it was really really
cute and super girly and I'm obsessed
with it I would probably wear this with
like black high-waisted jeans pair of
like black booties or black boots and
then maybe like a big black jacket and
like a scarf or something like that over
it so next I have this acid-wash jeans
jacket I got it in the two colors that
it comes in once more of like a black
undertone and
this one has more like like a greenish
bluish gray undertone I wore this jacket
for my birthday this year I actually
borrowed it from my best friend and I
loved it so much that I ended up
purchasing it afterwards can really
throw a jean jacket over everything you
can leave it on normal you can have it
like drapes but I love how this one is
oversized and it's not to tie anything
like that it looks almost like it's
Brett's jacket that I sold so next I
have this cute little jean skirt
I love the button details on the front
when I saw this online I was like oh
this would look really really cute with
like a sweater these are like knee-high
socks and shoes or maybe like thigh
highs or like something cute like that
or even like a pair of like high-top
Commerce's you can also feel like a
tight long-sleeved bodysuit or shirt
like tucked in with a belt I think that
would look really cute as well
I love how mister bear just has to join
in on the video it's like he knows that
he's being filmed and he just wants to
be the star of the show as always I wish
you guys could have seen what he just
did he my showers like right behind
where my camera is and there's like a
Ledge maybe this then um like my
cellphone barely been fits on it and
he's sitting there like trying to like
jump up like he's looking at that ledge
like he could jump up on it and he goes
he jumps up hits the glass and then
falls back down there we do it bye
so moving on I also picked this up very
like rugged-looking looks old and worn
but I absolutely love it and I love the
color of this one because you have like
a light blue and then you also have the
dark blue in it so you can really wear
this with like anything and I purchased
both of the jean jackets in a size
medium so I'm just suggest one up like
one or two sizes with the jackets if you
want it to fit super baggy so next up I
have this cute little crop top I believe
it comes in like every color I feel like
a pair of those high-waisted knit beige
leggings
and then either like a sweater like a
jean jacket and a pair of like little
boots or even sneakers clothing about
these little crop tops is you can wear
them normal like this or you can also
wear them with like a little knot in the
front and it'll give it like a tied up
look kind of like that so next I have a
similar type of shirt and felt like a
sweatshirt it's a little bit darker of a
green you can see the other ones more
like a mint this is kind of more of a
khaki green I believe this came in a few
other colors as well but I think they
were sold out so that's why I ended up
getting like two green crops shirts but
I would probably wear either like a pair
of high-waisted sweatpants and also do
like a pair of high waisted leggings and
boots or sneakers or really anything
like that I love simple things like this
because you can mix and match and really
wear like any different colors and have
it color blocked or anything like that
so next time I have this army print
hooded dress it has like button details
down the front or they're not buttons or
like snaps and they actually do come
unsnapped so this is how it came with
like the bottom on snaps like that I
guess it's really all about preference
if you want to commit fully snapped or
if you want to have like a little bit
higher of a slit you can unsnap it can
never go wrong with some army print so I
had to pick this up as well so next up I
have this on your print t-shirt this I
actually did wear in my last blog post I
wanted to show you guys this again
because I saw a couple people asking
like why did you buy it in an extra
large so this is men's with a men's
t-shirt and I wanted it as like a
t-shirt dress and the other day when I
was picking out my outfit for my post I
wanted to do something like more baggy
so I decided to go with this and then I
just tied it up and like a knot kind of
like what I said to do with the crop top
and then I wore it with those knit
leggings so yes this is an extra large
yes it's very big but I wanted as a
t-shirt dress so that was my main
reasoning behind getting it
so large so next I have another pair of
the embellished joggers these are the
green ones that I picked up um just look
at them like look at the colors on them
so hard to resist these I'm not going to
go much into detail again with these
because same thing as the others I just
love sweatpants I love embellishments so
the mixture of the two was just almost
happen my so next up I have this camel
ribbed sweater it's long like super long
let's see how long would be on me it
goes to like about my ankles when I saw
it on the model just like it looks so
comfy I just want to wear it all the
time what would I wear this with that's
the question like you couldn't really
throw this over anything if you want to
wear like jeans and a t-shirt and then
just throw this on with a pair of like
camel shoes that would look super cute
you can also do like a two-piece match
and separate outfit whether it's like
leggings and a matching top or something
like that with this thrown over it so
next up similar as when I'm wearing now
it's a crop top with the white Puma band
around there and then it has matching
hands and then there's also a drawstring
so you can tie it tighter so this next
bodysuit is definitely not a fall or
winter item but as if you're Bahamas on
Friday so I did purchase this because I
wanted to wear it in Bahamas um it's a
pink bodysuit and it's all lace I would
probably wear this with like a skirt I
don't know if I want would you like a
mini skirt or a maxi skirt probably a
skirt those what I'm thinking either
that are maybe like a pair of highways
chargers maybe
a pair of like wide leg trousers I think
I have a parent like black that may look
cute with this I'll definitely make sure
to get pictures while I'm away so you
guys can see how I decided to pair
everything I'm a very last minute person
especially when it comes to packing like
I'll have an idea of what I want to wear
and then when it comes down to action
packing and trying things on I'm like oh
no that's not what I thought it would be
so I have no idea what I'm going to be
bringing and I leave in three days so
hey so next up I have this velvet kimono
poncho II type of jacket look at the
back how cute a little tiger on the back
I love baggy ponchos especially to throw
over like a tighter outfit and I don't
know I just saw the back of this and I
just feel like so next I have this
orange crop sweatshirt this one actually
has a hood same thing with the green
sweatshirt I would probably just pair
this with a pair of high waist leggings
or highway sweats and call it a day one
of my more casual outfits these I
literally live in like for instance if
I'm going to the store I'm gonna get my
nails done or anything like that like I
don't want to roll out of bed and like
just wear pajamas although not gonna lie
sometimes I do but on those types of
days where I'm feeling super lazy like
it's always cool to just throw on like
something that looks really cute and put
together but it's also really comfy at
the same time so these I know I will be
living in the next couple of months and
I really love this orange color I've
been like obsessed with oranges lately
so happy oh we have a Cindy mama in the
house current time to shine so next I
have these leggings they are like an
orange color I figured I'd wear these
with like a white t-shirt a jean jacket
and a pair of like converses I love how
they have the thick band at the top
because it kind of like squeezes in your
waist a little bit more use you in Nice
shape let's just take a moment for this
shirt right here ah look at the tassels
from Bella it's cropped like this was
made for me so I had to get it I have no
idea what I'm
where where I'm gonna wear this or what
I'm gonna wear it with I may bring some
Bahamas actually I was thinking probably
a pair of high waist black trousers
maybe like a wide leg high waist rouser
um either that or maybe even like a pair
of skinny black jeans really depends I
have to try it on and kind of see like
what goes good with it but I love the
tassels they're just so amazing so next
I have this velvet t-shirt dress I
figured I wear this with like a corset
belts I just love that look of like the
baggy anything with a corset belt and
then last but not least I have this
embellished bodysuit I feel like this is
another piece that I will bring with me
to the Bahamas maybe with like a black
tights pencil skirt or black pants maybe
black jeans to make it a little more
casual and then probably just like a
pair of sandals or something like that
but I love like the tribal print and the
beaded detail it's just so gorgeous and
I feel like my biggest weakness is
anything with embellishment so the
entire time is sympathy girl was
watching me play with all my clothes
whenever I like playing with new makeup
or I'm doing my makeup or I'm in my
closet she follows because she's a real
girly girl so those are my recent
purchases I hope you guys enjoyed this
