those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly and today I'm going to be
trying out this magnetic face mask I
have been in bed sick for the past two
days and it's currently around 8:30 at
night but I hold myself out of bed to
film a new video for you guys and I feel
like I sound weird cuz like I hurt so
bad when I swallow but anyways I have
been noticing my skin has been a little
bit bad as of lately which I feel like I
kind of jinxed myself I don't remember
if it was my last video and I was
probably two videos ago where I was like
I don't really have any pimples right
now and then my face just went crazy I
tried out a couple new serums and I had
bumps all over my face like my entire
face luckily a lot of them went away but
I do have some breakouts plus like I
said I've been feeling pretty sick so my
skin is just kind of under the weather
so I figured I would try out a new face
mask today so I'm gonna read what it
says it's gonna do because I don't
really know much about magnetic masks
just the idea of it sounds really really
cool so I wanted to try it but it says
this combative mask is formulated with
powerful magnetic properties and key
antioxidants carrot seed oil sunflower
seed oil vitamin C vitamin E and argan
oil to replenish your skin and help
protect against everyday environmental
Ivor's aggressors aggressors the
magnetic tool and iron base formula work
together to visibly lift the way surface
impurities and minimize the appearance
of pores skin is left feeling soft and
recharge for a smooth makeup ready
canvas so let's get right into this
video I received this mask in a PR
package from ELF and it was actually
right after I did my last math video so
I had ordered a couple different ones
I ordered the bubble masks so I was kind
of torn between the two but this one was
kind of calling my name tonight so I
figured I would try this one but I just
wanted to let you guys know they're not
paying me and
way to make this video I just genuinely
want to try it
this mask retails for $24 so let's see
if it even works so it says that it's
one point seven six ounces and it's
antioxidant powered and it is formulated
without parabens sulfates I don't know
how to say this
fatale a law that's a late fest elites
fest elites this is what it looks like
it actually smells kind of good kind of
smells like orange is a little bit which
is nice so I'm excited about that I
didn't think it would actually have a
smell and then it also comes with this
which is what's gonna help take off the
mask I'm guessing that these go over
this to protect this from getting dirty
so let's it first apply the mask I'm
gonna use whatever's left on the cap
first no a generous amount all over my
face it smells really really good which
is nice
so obviously you want to avoid your eye
area
it's kind of tingling my skin right now
I'm gonna try it but honestly I might be
allergic shoot no that's supposed to
tingle oh well
oh no if I have an allergic reaction so
let's pray that I don't die from this
mask I love using face masks what I'm
not feeling good because I just feel
like my skin gets super dull and dry so
I don't feel as tingly as I felt when I
first applied it so that's a good sign
there was one time but it was probably
like nine joking 15 years ago I try to
mask and it was stinging so bad so I was
like I don't know if that means it's
really working really well or what but I
decided to wash it off because it was
like almost unbearable and my entire
face was bright red so I was definitely
allergic to it I think I'm fine with
this though because it's been sitting on
my face and I'm okay right now
so there's about that much left which is
good I could probably get I'm thinking
like four or five maybe six pieces out
of this so it says to leave on for five
to ten minutes so I'm gonna leave it on
for 10 minutes because I always like to
do like the max time you suggested I
feel like it works better in my opinion
so I'm gonna go watch this makeup brush
and I will see you guys in 10 minutes
so it has been about 15 minutes and how
to order some food because I was
starving so I'm gonna take one of these
little things out of the bag I'm gonna
put it over the magnet and I wanted to
keep this zoomed in close so you guys
can really see what's going on I'm gonna
get my mirror close to because I'm
actually really excited to see this so
from what I think is gonna happen it's
gonna stick to this so let's try it
don't no no you guys I'm not even like
can you see this
I didn't even touch my skin with it okay
I'm excited
that is frickin cool look at that
so now what I'm wondering is does it all
just stick or not have to wipe this off
so I want to do another piece just so
you can see come on if you hold it close
you could feel it
this is the coolest thing I've ever done
in my life honestly
you might have been touching my skin at
this point because there's like a huge
glob I'm amazed I'm honestly amazed I'm
just confused how it's not like wiping
back on my skin because there's a lot on
here right now you guys can see there's
a lot so I can't get this rust off I'm
gonna go wash my face really quick but
first I'm gonna zoom in on this because
this is really cool so this is what it
looks like how cool is that so I just
used like a washcloth and some cold
water to wipe off the remaining of the
mask I don't have any lotion or anything
on it so my skin definitely feels super
super soft it's not irritated which is
good because I was a little bit worried
about that as far as pore size all right
I guess my skin feels a little bit
tighter I think overall it did a really
nice job it smells delicious like orange
isn't nice and fresh like I said please
