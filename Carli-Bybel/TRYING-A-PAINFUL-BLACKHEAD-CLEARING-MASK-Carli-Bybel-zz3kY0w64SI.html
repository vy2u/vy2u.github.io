those of you guys that are new my name
is Carly I am a little bit sick so if I
sound stuffy I apologize I'm like just
getting over a cold but I just got a new
mask in the mail today and I really
wanted to try it so I figured I would
throw myself trying it out it's the acne
purifying peel-off black mask so I saw a
lot of reviews on this product and I
genuinely wanted to try it because I get
a lot of satisfaction seeing stuff come
out of my pores I've done poor strips a
million times in my life and I just love
like when you rip it off and you can see
like all of the crap coming out of your
pores so if you want to see this mask in
action then please keep watching
alright saw some reviews on this product
and I heard that it is very painful but
beauty is pain do you guys ever get lost
on Instagram and end up on like those
pimple popper pages some of them I
genuinely can't handle but some of them
I don't know why it's like so gross but
like I can't look away and I get like
lost like scrolling through all about no
that's really gross but people are weird
but myself included I don't know it's
just like interesting to me to see stuff
coming out of your pores
alright so let's get into this dry the
cleanse area and apply the mask on
desired area avoid eyebrows eyes and
lips peel off after 20 to 30 minutes I'm
using this little foundation brush to
apply it it's really cold it might be
cold from being in my mailbox though so
I'm not like a huge mask person I do
them on occasion like if I have an event
or if my skin is just feeling really
gross I picked up a couple new ones but
this one I really wanted to try first
because I want to clean out my pores
where does my hair end in my face tart I
don't know I'm hoping it's not too
painful I know like the poor strips are
pretty painful and I'm doing
all over my face but it's fine let's do
here Tina why not
my nose is sore from blowing it so much
so this actually might be a dumb ribbon
what I'm wondering is if it really hurts
am i able to just wash it off or I just
didn't have to bite the bullet all right
so it says to leave on for 20 to 30
minutes so I'm just gonna go I know what
my cat's so I'm gonna set my timer
unless I die for 30 so it's only been
like 10 minutes and it's already getting
really tight like I can't even really
move my face children let's see if I go
wake up bear if he gets scared cuz of my
face here's my only look at mommy's face
look at me he doesn't care
Hey look at mommy we look scary
oh yeah you don't care because you're
such an angel and you don't judge
anybody by how they look right but I
think it's so funny when people complain
that I show them too much it's like
they're the most innocent beautiful
creatures how could you ever complete
this is me trying to smile so it's
starting to get extremely tight so I'm
gonna head back up because I feel like
my timer is about to go off my mother I
can't even move my face why am i scaring
you I don't look pretty no because I
think when you pull it off you will be
able to see it 30 more seconds hmm
that noise reminds me of my alarm every
morning I hate it so where do I start
I'm scared I have what hurts already
cuz I have hair oh I don't wanna do it
oh do I do it quick like a band-aid or
do I do it slow I'm gonna do a quick 1 2
3
yeah quick is definitely better ah I'm
gonna zoom in on what comes out of it
after you know it's gross ohh
my face is so red I feel like I just got
waxed I'm gonna learn you to wax so I
don't ever get waxed ok ready 1 2 oh my
our eyes twitching look I'm really not
trying to be dramatic I'm gonna do it
fast ready 1 2 3
Oh
we're gonna just see like a lot of hairs
I think I waxed my face I'm gonna go
wash my face and I'll be right back
so I just used like a wash pot to get
the remaining off you can see my skin is
really red right now I have a pretty
sensitive skin so I'm definitely not
allergic to it because I would have
known instantly like I've used masks
before and like as soon as I put them on
they were tingling like crazy and I knew
I was allergic but I think it's just a
red because it looks like it literally
ripped off all the hair on my face my
skin I don't have lotion I didn't put
any lotion or anything on my skin feels
really really soft though it definitely
took hair out of my face like I could
see cuz I use a razor and I used like an
eyebrow razor and I shaved my face
normally which I didn't but you could
tell that it like took off the hair like
even on my nose which is actually cool
because I hate those little hairs that
you got on your nose I don't think my
pores look any smaller maybe like a
little bit very irritated up here
probably because my skin is like what's
up did you just do to me I'm gonna zoom
in so you guys can see what's on my mask
you know it's gross so if you get
grossed out easily then just fast
forward this part but I know there's a
lot of weirdos out there like me that
want to see it so let me zoom in real
quick cool guess it worked more than I
thought it did and I'm looking at it
this close this is so gross but it's
like satisfying you know like knowing
that all that just came out of my skin
like that makes me happy okay so after
seeing it close-up feel like it works a
lot better than I realize so I'm so
happy all that stuff whether it's hair
or blackheads is out of my face now my
skin does feel it really soft and nice
although it is a little bit red and like
irritated so I'm gonna probably go do
like a cold compress with like a towel
and then apply some serums that way my
skin can chill out a little bit but yeah
that was actually really cool I feel you
should not use this that often I don't
know if it says it maybe like once a
month if that
you guys need like a deep cleaning but
I'll definitely use that again it was
extremely painful
I do recommend ripping it off pretty
quickly it's a little bit better than if
you slowly do it and then you have to
think about your decision and it's just
kind of like makes everything worse so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I know something a little bit different
but I was just genuinely curious to try
out this mess so please remember to
subscribe to my channel if you aren't
already comment below and let me know if

more videos like this and my eyes
twitching again as I'm talking so yeah

serum on this poor little face that just
got waxed off thank you guys for
