today's video I'm gonna try out some of
the new k'kaw beauty products I was
actually really excited to try the
concealer and the powders because that
to me is my favorite part of my makeup
routine so I already have foundation on
and a little bit of eye makeup so I'm
gonna just be testing out those products
today in my color so if you guys want to
see my review then please keep watching
so my mobile groomer just got here I'm
giving my cat's a little bit of a
haircut the two fluffy ones I swear
every week they get poop stuck on there
but because they're so fluffy so we're
gonna kind of shave them down a little
bit give them a cute haircut and then
chai is getting her first bath ever and
bows and get a bath as well so if you
guys hear them crying from outside you
know why they're fine this lady is
really really good but anyway let's get
right into the products I found that my
color that's closest to me right now
with a little bit of a tan is number
seven for the concealer for the powder
I'm doing bake number two and then for
the brighten powders I have one two and
three and I'm gonna try them and kind of
mix them and maybe see which works best
for me so every time I do my full face
routine I always like to do my cream
contour on my nose first and then I'll
go in with my concealer so I'm just
gonna quickly do that okay so now that I
have my nose contour on I'm gonna go in
with the number seven concealer and the
reason that I like to do my nose first
is because I almost like having the
cream contour dry a little bit so I will
put my concealer blend out my concealer
and then I'll go
back in and led up the nose so right off
the bat it does look like a small amount
of product it says there is 0.16 two
ounces so so comparing it to my favorite
which is the shape tape you can see
there is definitely a lot less product
the shape team has 0.33 fluid ounces and
apply this underneath my eyes down my
swag lines my chin and I like to use
like a generous amount and also between
my brows so with my damp Beauty Blender
I'm going to start blending that in
so I watched a couple of the reviews
before I filmed mine and people are
saying that it was really drying as of
right now I don't see that at all I will
let you know in a few minutes it seems
to be blending out really nicely it's
really creamy and I like this color for
me I do have a little bit of body runs
are on so obviously my natural seems a
little bit later but probably didn't
even went a little bit darker so I would
say go for all covered pretty nicely
when I do apply shape deep sometimes I
will even apply like a double layer so
I'm gonna go in with the number 8 just
to see if this color is maybe a little
bit darker this one is fine because with
bronzer and powders and all of that it
ends up being darker anyway but I'm
gonna apply a little bit of 8 right
under my eyes so this one definitely is
more of like a yellow undertones but
it's a little bit darker so we're gonna
just blend that die out so I would say
that it's consistency is pretty similar
actually to the shape tape I use that
one literally every single day and I
think it's blending out pretty nicely
pretty similar I should say so next I
would just do like a little bit of like
a cream contour yeah after the concealer
I'm just gonna do a little bit of that
we're gonna just blend this in really
quickly yes so honestly I don't know a
lot of people were saying it was so
drying how to blend one side in at a
time I even have my air conditioning on
right above me blowing air and I think
it blended it out really really nicely
but concealer always looks good so it's
all about how we set it and then how it
looks afterwards so we shall see how it
looks with the baking powder
I guess I'll use the yellow there number
eight again I like to always apply two
stripes of concealer right next to the
contour on my nose and then I go in with
my Tarte brush and I like to push that
down down the sides and then up over the
brown
is again my exact routine what I would
normally do with my regular products
that I use okay so I would say this
under eyes looking nicely covered this
one was looking a little like you could
see my darkness a little bit through so
let's apply a little bit more so the key
with concealers I'm apply a little bit
there too is before you set anything you
want to make sure all of your problem
areas are covered because once you set
it you can't add more coverage so I'm
just going to very very lightly blend
that just so I can make sure my dark
circle is covered before I set it with
the powder so that works so it looks a
little bit more right now so it's a bake
I'm gonna use number two and this has
point one two three ounces where is my
cap on and we're gonna compare it to the
one that I usually use as the cap on D
this one has 0.67 ounces so this has a
lot more I'm gonna compare the prices on
screen right now I don't know them
offhand so again you're not getting a
lot of product so I'm gonna tap it off
into my cap it has like a little bit of
like a pinkish undertone I'm going to
take my cap on the number 4 brush and
I'm gonna take a heavy amount I'm gonna
make sure all my wrinkles are smooth out
and I'm gonna apply that right under
right down the darkness of my nose blend
out here
bündchen I'm also gonna bring that right
under the cream contour here
and I'm going to lend out my forehead
and just apply that on there as well and
we're done
no I'm just kidding imagine so I'm gonna
let this sit for a little bit I'm gonna
go in with my and like palette to
go over the nose contour I always like
to do this while I'm baking because when
I wipe away the powder it's gonna kind
of diffuse it nose a little bit I'm
gonna let this sit for like a couple
more minutes normally I would be doing
my brows it gives it like the perfect
amount of time for the powder to bake
okay so it's been about five minutes so
I'm gonna start wiping away the powder
I'm using that same brush and I'm gonna
use a very light hand and do like
circular motions
okay so my foreheads looking good my
under eyes are looking a little bit dry
and like chalky and I'm noticing like my
dark circle came back out what I always
do after I use as much powder as I've
always go in with the setting spray to
add some moisture back into my face so
I'm gonna do that and then we'll judge
how it looks after that so I'm just
going to take a little bit of my Mario
Badescu spray I'm gonna go in with my
Beauty Blender and just kind of like
push
okay so now that I added some setting
spray it definitely looks a lot less dry
so I was a little bit worried not gonna
lie I thought there was no no hope but I
added moisture and I swear it looks a
lot better the only thing is you can
kind of see the darkness a little bit
but the bryan powder that she came out
with is similar to like this foundation
powder that i'll use that will add a
little bit more coverage so we'll see
how that works
Wow here's one two and three so the
first one is definitely gonna be way too
light for me I'm not even attempt that
number two has a little bit of a pink
undertone and number three is more of
like a banana so I'm gonna probably mix
the two of them and I know that comes
with brushes but I really want to use my
brushes that I use so I can give my
honest true opinion about the products
because if I'm using her brushes and it
doesn't look the same how can I really
judge it because I'm not using the same
products so I'm gonna go in with number
two and I'm gonna press a decent amount
and I'm going to apply that right next
to the contour lines
okay so obviously this one's a little
too late I'm gonna go in with the banana
over it maybe add a little bit of color
go back in with my Beauty Blender
I'm gonna play a little bit on my chin
and also here
so you can see a brand a lot I didn't do
any bronze or anything yet so I'm gonna
do the same thing I'm gonna take number
two push that up against my nose
go over it with the banana or the yellow
you're I'm sorry
I feel like this almost sounds like a
sheen to it I'm gonna push with my penny
blender so my face is looking super
light I'm going to warm it up
maybe the brightening powder maybe I
used a little bit too much I used it in
place of like my foundation powder
because that's the type of powder I like
to use to really brighten up my face so
I'm just applying the darker cat 1b
foundation shade as like a bronzer when
I go in with my shading light palette to
come to her a little bit more
and again we're gonna go in with the
powder I mean the setting spike and I'm
just gonna like roll the powders
together I think it looks good honestly
so I'm going to take this gold shade
from my palette highlight my nose
because I swear the nose doesn't look
good until you do this step
so I'm just gonna finish off my lips and
my eyes and I'll be right back
so I just did my bottle mascara it's
still drying I'm gonna take a little bit
of this nude blush and then we're gonna
finish it off with one more spray so I
actually have plans and a little bit and
I was really hoping this was gonna work
so I don't have to redo it and you guys
I'm not just saying this I really really
like how it looks I'm honestly shocked
because they really really love using
foundation powder underneath my eyes
because it really brings it forward it
helps my nose contour look good and I
have to say I really like how this looks
I look up really closely so when I first
went away the powder yes it looked
really dry and I got a little bit
worried because I know I had seen some
reviews and people were saying it was
really dry but whenever I apply any
powder and I wipe it away I always
always always use some sort of setting
spray because what that does is it kind
of just melts the makeup into your skin
and it helps get rid of any dry patches
so really looking at it I honestly am
pleasantly surprised at how good it
looks I feel like my makeup looks how it
always looks
which was kind of my goal for this I
would definitely use it again yes
the products are small you can get a lot
of products in it but it performed
exactly how it should have which is a
relief because I mean her makeup always
looks flawless so for her to come out
with a product that didn't really work
it kind of not make sense do you need
them no do they work yes so if you do
spend the money I would suggest maybe
following along on my steps because it
worked for me everyone has different
techniques everyone uses different
products so obviously everyone's gonna
have a different reaction yeah I'm gonna
a little bit closer so you guys can see
it more close up so this is it pulls in
a little bit you guys can see it blended
really nicely it did cover my dark
circles it doesn't feel too dry it feels
nice on the skin I would definitely have
to say the key to making this work is a
setting spray whatever one is your
favorite because Annie and moisture back
into your skin especially when it's
super dry is so important and also using
the damp Beauty Blender that helps as
well I always like to kind of push the
product in and just make sure it's all
melting together nicely so so this is
the final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you guys did go out and
try it let me know what your thoughts on
it work obviously I know there were a
lot of complaints about the shade ranges
and all of that which I agree with if
you are coming out with our nation's
concealers powders anything like that
there's no excuse now not to have every
shade range especially because of all
the drama that has been going on the
other brands that had done it so people
should definitely be more aware so as
far as the shade ranges I think she
should definitely branch out and add a
lot more colors but for my specific skin
tone I did find colors in her collection
that did work for me I hope you guys
