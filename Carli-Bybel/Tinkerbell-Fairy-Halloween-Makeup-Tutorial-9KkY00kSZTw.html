let's travel across the sand in my magic
Neverland you give me faith I'll give
you trust and pixie dust
nikka five pirates wait could dance with
Indian
if you want the plague I cry with Peter
by your side you've got no fear
hi everyone thank you for watching so
this year when I was searching the
internet trying to find some costumes
for Halloween I came across this
adorable Tinkerbell costume this one is
from a my club where and all their
costumes right now are 45% off which is
amazing so I will link the website below
if you guys are still in search for
Halloween costumes when it comes to
Halloween I've never been the type to do
anything scary or I need that crazy
makeup so I mean the Barbie tutorial was
a little bit outside of my comfort zone
but this tutorial is definitely
something I would do and what I would
dress up as I love everything girly and
I love the rhinestones and the glitter
and sparkles and all that kind of stuff
so if you guys are looking for scary
tutorials you're obviously in the wrong
place but I will be doing a whole bunch
of tutorials because I did order a lot
more costumes so if you guys want to
learn how to get this adorable
Tinkerbell makeup look then please keep
watching and I will show you how for an
eyeshadow base I'm taking this lime
green color from my fantasy maker
palette this can be found at any
drugstore and I'm going to be applying
this all over my entire eyelid thanks
baby
if you guys went out and tried my chai
that I recommended in a previous video
try it with the pumpkin spice it's
amazing I'm using the take me to Brazil
palette from BH again and I'm taking
this dark green color and I'm going to
be applying this right in the crease of
my eye
one thing I like to do is use something
with a straight edge to get a perfect
line I'm just using the side of my
eyelashes that I use grabbing that same
dark green color with my small angled
brush I'm then going to be lining
underneath my eyes next I'm grabbing
these two lime green colors I'm going to
be mixing them and I'm going to be
blending this right underneath the line
that I had just done and I'm also going
to be extending it out picking up a
little bit of the black with my blending
brush I'm then going to be blending this
on the outer V of my eye to create some
more depth
to line my upper lash line I'm using
this dark black gel liner from BH and a
small eyeliner brush next I'm going to
be applying my false lashes what I like
to do is cut them in half and I'm just
going to be using the outer part next
grabbing this white color I'm going to
be applying this right underneath my
eyebrow whenever I apply glitter I
always like to use fix+ by Mac and then
the loose glitter on top of it it helps
it stick a lot better and it also
prevents fallout all over your face
then picking up this lime green color
I'm just gonna go right over that and
that's gonna help set the glitter and
it's also gonna give it a more lime
green look
to apply the rhinestones to my face I'm
going to be using eyelash glue I'm going
to be using the bottom of a brush and
I'm just going to be dotting on the glue
and then I'm going to be applying the
rhinestones grabbing a dark green color
that I use first I'm going to be
contouring my face a little bit just to
give my face a greener look I'm going to
be repeating the same process when
applying the rhinestones and I'm just
adding a few rhinestones above my
eyebrow and then underneath my other eye
you
to line my lips I'm using Jordana
cosmetics and tawny
and for lipgloss I'm using bicolor your
smile and nude the lip gloss and this
one comes with a UV light and a mirror
on it which is pretty cool I wanted to
add some glitter onto my chest so I'm
just going to be using some hairspray
and this blush brush I just spray the
hairspray right onto my skin and then
dip the brush into the glitter and then
it's six to your skin so this is the
final result I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and if any of you guys are
being Tinkerbell this year and you
