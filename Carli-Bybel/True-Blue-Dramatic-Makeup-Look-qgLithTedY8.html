so you shut your
he's just out of
so when it shoot
hi everyone thank you for watching I'm
so sorry it's been like forever since I
posted a video I was sick last week so I
was home laying on my couch and I am
thankful I did not do anything because I
do feel a lot better this week so again
I do apologize and I'm gonna try and get
as many videos up this week as I can I
wanted to do a more dramatic look
because I feel like I've been doing a
lot more natural neutral colors and for
those of you who want maybe something
more dramatic or something out of your
comfort zone this one is for you guys
and I love this because I have not worn
blue in my eyes in probably a year and I
wanted to switch it up a little bit so
again you can just use my technique and
use different colors or try it out how I
did it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I promise to get as many
videos up as I can have a great day guys
I'll see you soon
to prime my eyes I'm just using my
concealer and I'm just gonna be applying
this all over my eyelid for this look
I'm using most of my colors from the BH
Malibu palette and I have used this in
another tutorial I love these these
colors are so pigmented and this whole
little set is only $11 the first color
in this palette I'm using is this bright
blue color and I'm using my Mac 213
brush this color I'm going to be
applying all over the middle part of my
eyelid and blending it outwards
then I'm taking this dark blue color
with the same brush and I'm going to be
applying this color right on the outer
part of my lid and also the inner part
of my lid and I'm going to be blending
it into the lighter blue color
so I let it's gonna be like this and
then the next step I'm going to be
taking my Mac 224 brush and this is the
big blending brush and I'm going to be
using a brighter orange color and this
one is from the 120 palette so I'm just
gonna be taking this bright orange right
here and this color is gonna be going
right in the crease of my eye with the
big blending brush and you'll see it
just gonna give it a little bit of a
brownish orange tint and you're just
gonna take a little bit on your brush
and very lightly blend it above your
crease and in your crease
then I'm taking this dark brown color
along with my Mac 217 blending brush
it's a little bit of a smaller blending
brush and I'm gonna be just taking a
little bit of that and I'm gonna be
applying it right in my crease and I'm
gonna be blending it into the darker
blue and I'm also gonna be very lightly
blending it into the orange that we had
just put in the crease
one way to get a really perfect blended
look is once you apply most of the
product on your lid and in the crease
you can just kind of do little Swift
motions like this to blend it outwards
that way it's not going to be too sharp
of a line it's just going to give it a
nice blended look and I'm also going to
repeat that in the inner part of my eye
then I'm taking this Brown sparkly color
and the same map blending brush and I'm
just gonna be blending that again right
in the crease blending the navy blue
with the brown
like my eyes I'm going to be using by
l'oréal it is the lacquer liner in the
color Navy and it's a dark blue gel
liner and it comes with a little brush
so I'm using the brush that comes with
it and I'm just gonna be lining my upper
lash line
so for the lashes I'm using these ones
they are Lily lashes I am reusing them
so I don't remember the exact name of
them I will list them below so I applied
my lashes and I apologize if my eyes are
a little red I was just crying and yes
so I do apologize so they are like beet
red right now and I put eye drops in but
they're not helping so the next step we
are going to be doing the lower lash
line and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
do the dark brown this dark brown and
then this blue I'm gonna do the brown on
the outer corners and then the blue in
the middle I'm just gonna be using this
brush this one is from BH Cosmetics it's
just a thin brush it's easy to apply
lower lash line eyeliner
you're gonna want to connect this brown
line with the eyeliner that you had also
done that way it's gonna extend your eye
and blend together nicely
now we're going to be moving on to the
lips and for lip liner I'm using the one
that I always use it's by Jordana
cosmetics and this you can get at
Walgreens and it's in the color tawny
and this one is like $1.99 and I promise
I use it literally every single day so I
highly recommend this
so for lips I'm going to be trying out
for the first time these new ones by
obsessive compulsive cosmetics their lip
tar and they come with five different
little colors in there it's a set and I
was in support yesterday and I saw these
and they looked really really cool so
I'm going to be trying them out for the
first time on camera so I guess we'll
see how it goes but I'm gonna try and
use this orange color and then I might
have to add like a gloss over it but it
says you use the white one first which
is gonna prime and moisturize your lips
and it comes a little brush and this is
just so I guess gonna go all over your
lips wait but why is it white is it
supposed to be white it's a clear lip
car
just one clear
Oh someone needs to tell me this is all
right I'm gonna try it anyway yeah I
think this is just white lipstick so I
think this part out of the video
well I'm going to be using this orangey
color and it says you just apply a
little bit to the lips
well so it's nice and orange I really
like these okay so I want a little bit
more of a nude Orange so I'm gonna take
a nude gloss just to give it a more
glossy look I'm going to be using this
lip gloss it's by whitening lightening
and it's called crystal what's really
cool is it has a mirror on it and it
also has a light on it so if you're out
and you don't have a mirror you can just
look in the little mirror and then apply
it that way and actually use this last
night when I went out to dinner and
someone actually stopped and was like
what is that thing I had to tell them so
it's so cool I love the little UV light
but just gonna give it a little bit of a
gloss
the final step I'm going to be adding a
peachy colored blush and since I don't
have one in front of me I'm just me
using the one that also comes in the
same BH palette and I'm going to use the
top of pinkish peach color
one thing I always do after I apply the
blush is like go back to this brush and
I just kind of blend it in that way
there's no sharp lines so this is the
finished result I know it's a little bit
more dramatic than something I would
normally wear on a day-to-day basis this
is something I would recommend for prom
or for a night out or a more formal
event and of course the blue is a little
bit more dramatic but you can switch it
up and use purples or you can use blacks
any colors that you want and use the
same techniques and you'll get the same
overall look so I hope you guys enjoyed
this look and stay tuned for more videos
this week because I was slacking last
because I was sick and I promise I will
make it up this week bye guys have a
great day
my name is Afrojack
