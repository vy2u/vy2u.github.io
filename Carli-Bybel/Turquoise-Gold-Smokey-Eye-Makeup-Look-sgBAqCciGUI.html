for a pretty little while it's somehow
you made me sound
a little sir
hi everybody thank you for watching so
this video I'm going to be teaching how
i got this makeup look that i'm wearing
right now for those of you who are
asking i did finally get my power back
on so thank you i know a lot of you were
concerned I'm so so grateful I did get
my power back on it's crazy what you
take for granted when you lose it all
and I know there's still so many people
left without power and it's so sad so
the last video that I had posted was
when I was still in the dark and I
really hadn't even seen any videos or
anything about sandy or about the storm
and everything now I've seen all the
devastation and what I did was I set up
a donate button on my website which is
Carli bybel calm and 100% of the profit
is going to be given to the American Red
Cross in efforts to help all the
devastation that sandy had left behind I
already raised over three hundred
dollars which is so so so amazing so
thank you as I wrote every dollar does
count and I really appreciate any
donations that any of you are giving I
know it's a tough time right now the
economy and everything so I do
appreciate anyone who is willing to
donate and if any of you were
questioning like if 100 percent of the
profit is gonna really go to the
American Red Cross what I'm going to be
doing is November 14th I'm going to be
ending the donation button I'll break
that down for you guys so you know and
I'm going to be sending a check to the
American Red Cross or I think you can do
it online so I'm gonna videotape it so
you guys can see I also have a counter
so every donation made it does update so
you can keep track of how much we have
raised and again yeah I'm gonna
videotape when I send in the money
however much we do raise any donation
counts please go check out my website
and if you would like to learn how I did
my makeup please keep watching for an
eyeshadow base I'm going to be using a
concealer all over my eyelids taking my
Mac 242 brush and the color Mutiny
pigment by Mac I'm going to be applying
this color all over my entire eyelids
next taking this light brown color and
my Mac 219 pencil brush I'm going to be
forming a diagonal line from my crease
diagonally up towards my eyebrow
taking my mac blending brush I'm going
to be blending in this line so there are
no sharp lines taking this orange bronze
color and my Mac blending brush I'm just
going to be blending this color into
that line and upwards next I'm taking my
Mac pencil brush and this black
eyeshadow and I'm going to be applying
this right on the outer V of my eye
connecting it with my lower lash line
I'm also going to be dragging this color
and blending it into the color on my
eyelid
next taking this dark green color I'm
going to be applying this right on my
eyelid to give it a blended look I'm
going to be dragging it out blending it
into the black color and also blending
it into the lighter blue color
next I'm taking vanilla pigment by Mac
and my same shader brush and I'm going
to be highlighting right underneath my
brow and also in my tear duct I'm using
my Mac gel liner and my Mac 210 eyeliner
brush and I'm just going to be forming a
line on my upper lash line
Salai my lower lashline I'm using a
small angled brush in this cold color
I'm just going to be applying a thin
line right underneath my lash line I'm
also going to be using the color amber
lights by Mac and that's going to go
right over it it's gonna give it a
bronzed look when I was filming this
part of the video I totally missed my
eye so I'm sorry I can't show the whole
thing I'm gonna be applying a light blue
glitter also on my eyelid just to give
it a little bit more of a fun look this
part is of course optional and I'm
taking a black eye liner and I'm just
going to be lining my inner waterline
for lashes I'm just cutting these in
half these are whispies by Ardell taking
that same vanilla pigment I'm just going
to be applying a little bit of this to
my Cupid's bow and that's just going to
highlight your lips and it's also going
to make them appear larger I'm using the
lip liner that I use in a lot of my
videos it's called tawny by Jordana
cosmetics and I get this out any
Walgreens
for lips I'm using this pretty pinkish
nude color it's called marvelous Moxie
it's by bare essentials and I got this
at Sephora she's beautiful in herself
only she don't wear too much too soon
she hits man at this point I'm gonna be
brushing off any excess glitter because
sometimes it does happen to fall all
over my face but I forgot to mention
when I was applying that glitter I use
fix+ and that way the glitter doesn't
end up like crazy mounts on my face
thank you all so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this look and
definitely go check out my facebook page
because I announced a new giveaway and
it's only for Twitter Facebook and
Instagram hope you all have an amazingly
and I'll see you guys soon
she understands she don't let go of
anything even when the pain gets really
bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
