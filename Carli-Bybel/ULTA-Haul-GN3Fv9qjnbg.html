am here in my new place and I'm so
excited to finally be sitting down and
filming for you guys because it has been
way too long
I really did not expect my move to take
as long as it's been taking I don't know
I guess since I never really moved all
my crap from one place to another I
didn't really know how long it was going
to take me my first move was right out
of my mom's house into my apartment
which was right around the block so it
was kind of like a slow move and I did
not have nearly as much crap as I do now
so I'm still unpacking there's still
probably like 500 boxes left so I do
apologize if I've been a little bit
behind lately but I promise once I'm all
settled in I will be back to filming
regularly and getting up all the videos
that you guys want to see so today I
actually went to Ulta there is a store
right by my new place and I've never
been into an Ulta before I know crazy
right so I figured I would do a haul
video for you guys so if you guys want
to see what I picked up today please
keep watching all right so this little
bag has a couple goodies in it so let's
go through what I decided to pick up the
first thing that I got was my EOS I saw
this actually on my way to pay you know
how they have like those last-minute
items that you just happen to look at
while you're waiting online to pay well
this was one of them it's a hand lotion
by EO so these were new and I was like
alright let me try it and I haven't
tried it yet so let's see mmm smells
really good yeah this is cool I figured
this would be awesome to just throw in
my purse if my hands are ever dry
because I washed my hands so many times
during the day and I always have dry
hands and that's like my biggest pet
peeve so this is really cool and it
smells really yummy it smells like um
like floral e ish also don't mind my
hair it's kind of a mess showered last
night and I really didn't have time to
do it and
I have been living in sweatpants because
I can't find any of my pants boxes so
yeah I'm just kind of a mess the past
week the second thing that I picked up
was by Jared minerals the golden medium
foundation just the powder foundation I
had gotten this probably a couple weeks
ago from Sephora I got the wrong color
so I wanted to replace it and I believe
this one is my color um I went and got a
facial recently and they were
recommending a powder foundation because
it doesn't seep into your pores as much
so I've actually never tried the bare
minerals I'm really excited to try the
foundation so I've this weird obsession
with sparkly liners lately so when they
had NYX there I went a little bit crazy
I picked up these five these five liners
um I also have this and like a turquoise
sparkle a gold Sparkle a silver sparkle
but yeah these ones were just really
pretty and I figured I would try them
out make a fun purpley look there's
actually three purpley ones so maybe I
should do purple next for my color
series yeah I love these lines I have
the champagne slash gold colored one
right over my black line and I just love
how these come out they're really I can
sit in sparkly and the next thing that I
picked up was also by NYX it's a lip
liner this one is called pinky beige and
I just thought it was like a really
pretty color believe it or not this is
nice I'll show you guys a swatch up
close later or not I actually don't
really have a lip liner this color and I
was using a lipstick this color the
other day and I didn't have a lip liner
so I was like I needed this next by
Urban Decay I picked up this shadow and
space cowboy and it's super sparkly and
pretty and when I tested it out on my
hand it just looked so shimmery and so
sparkly so I definitely wanted to try
this one out and the next product is by
Stella I have a couple of views they are
the metal foil finish eyeshadows I
absolutely love these I have it in the
color kitten and like I'm a gold bronzy
color this one is called metallic pixie
dust
let's take it
I could show you guys I love how these
come looks like a little liquid to dip
your brushes in because I always
recommend you guys to use some sort of
liquid primer for your eyeshadows or for
your eyeshadow brush um you can use fix
plus you can use eye drops but this one
comes with a cute little key little jar
of liquid and yes this is this one it's
super shimmery I was thinking of doing a
all white eyeshadow look with like some
really shimmery shadows so when I saw
this I was like guess I need this next
up by dermablend I picked up the
quickfix concealer in the color ivory I
heard so many good things about
dermablend my mom actually used to use
this brand when she had her tattoo
removed and when she got to remove there
was still some leftover tattoo so she
would she got the dermablend because
it's a very thick concealer I haven't
tried any of these yet so I will keep
you guys updated eyes I'm thinking of
doing like a makeup look using all new
products and then giving you guys my
reviews on them but I've heard great
things about the derma bun so I'm
excited to try that one out the next
brand I actually never heard of its
called japonesque Jack bonus Geoff
japan-us I don't know but it's a Velvet
Touch finishing powder these people
always get me with the like how they
describe whatever it is I was like ooh
Velvet Touch and they had a sample I
touched and felt very velvety so it's
actually just a setting powder so you
can use it for your concealer for your
foundation it's just a white color umm
I'll show you guys what it looks like oh
cool I didn't realize it had that cool
little has like a pretty little front to
it but it's just a nice setting powder
hmm
I got two more things I honestly thought
this was gonna be like a cheap ball but
it ended up being like 180 dollars bet I
use Brett's credit card because I forgot
mine at home
um the next thing I got is also by NYX
it's an illuminator and it's a really
pretty peach color I figured this would
be cool to used as like a blush and an
illuminator and it's a really really
pretty finish to it and I just love how
she Marie it is and I don't know this
summer I'm just all about shimmery
everything so I'm excited to try this
one out as well and the last thing that
I got was also on the little like kiosk
thing when you're walking out it's the
it's also buyeo's and I have like every
color
Yas ball and I love I love those
lipsticks I mean chopsticks they're
really good but this one has like pink
and white or pink and lightning stripes
on it I know so I had to buy it just
because the packaging I know it's stupid
but I used so much chapstick so I
figured hey I know I'll use it so yeah
that is actually it for my little haul I
went in for like two things and then I
ended up spending again a little bit
more than I should have but so so that
is it for now
I hope you guys enjoyed this video again
thank you guys for being patient with me
I know I've been a little bit slacking
I've been a little bit slacking I've
been slacking lately so I do apologize
but once I am all impact which may take
ten months now hopefully soon enough I
will be back on my schedule to videos
every single week and hopefully more
more fashion more everything me and
Brett made a pact that once we were all
settled we were gonna go like full force
and just really really hustle and get as
much stuff out for you guys as possible
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
can't wait to show you guys my whole
Beauty room I am very close to being
finished so I'm gonna wait to reveal it
once I'm all finished but I love you
guys so much and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
