leave we're gonna go to the nursery to
pick out our tree I wanted to blog my
experience because I'm hoping this will
push some more of you guys to go out and
plant a tree we've never done it before
either so it will be a first experience
for us we called around a bunch of
places and we ended up getting the
approval from breast aunt to plant a
tree in her yard so we are gonna go over
to the nursery pick out some seeds or I
guess that's how it works and then we're
gonna go plant it I wanted to take you
guys along for the journey with us again
to help motivate you guys to go out and
do it and to show you that it's not as
hard as some of you guys are saying so
the whole point of this giveaway was to
get you guys off your tush and go out
and do something positive for our planet
because I think it's something that we
all tend to forget about so here we go
excited

benefiting our earth and some of you may
not realize how beneficial it is but it
really is so beneficial and whatever we
leave behind is what our children and

point
