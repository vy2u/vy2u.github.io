just finishing up my makeup I have to
run to store really quick to get some
elastics from CVS we have people here
doing construction we've had them here
yesterday and today just opening up some
doors in my closet and getting really
everything prepared my closets being
installed next Wednesday so a week from
today so loud inside so I was planning
on filming a regular video for you guys
today but since it's so loud and I don't
think that's even gonna be possible I
figured I would do a little vlog so I
posted a sneak peek a couple minutes ago
finally been able to tell you guys what
I've been working on you think I can get
around you Yeah right yeah you sure all
right well that's awkward just got
caught up loggin I've been dying to tell
you guys like it's been so hard to keep
it in that's why I was in London we
actually flew to Manchester and then we
were there for two days and then we took
the train to London so I didn't want to
tell anyone I was in Manchester because
I figured that would have given it away
there are 50 pieces in the collection
which is awesome only got about half of
the samples so I don't have all of them
yet but I'm gonna show you guys all of
them at some point just not yet so just
a little bit longer we have to wait and
I'm so excited that you guys are excited
because without any of you none of this
would even be possible so I love you
guys so much seriously thank you so we
leave for LA tomorrow night we are
originally supposed to leave this
morning and we switched our flight till
tomorrow night because we had people
over doing construction so we had to get
all that done because a week from today
is when they start installing stuff so
we needed everything done before I went
to LA we're supposed to be going to
VidCon on Friday our apartment is up it
can't believe it's already been a year
which is crazy so we get all of our
stuff out of our apartment and get that
all done and then our flights at 5 I am
on Sunday so it's gonna be a very very
quick trip but I'm glad it's gonna be
quick because I really need to be home I
have so much to do and once this trips
over I feel like I don't have any plans
to go anywhere for at least the
so that's good so that way I can get my
videos back up I can start doing my blog
post again and I'm also in the process
of redoing my blog if you guys have
noticed I haven't been too active on my
blog the past few months I have someone
redesigning it for me
so I tried redesigning it myself and I
spent hours and hours and hours and
hours because I've always done my blogs
by myself anyway and it just was not
coming out how I had hoped so I have
someone redesigning it for me that
should be done hopefully within the next
couple of weeks I feel like once that is
done I'll be way more excited to be
posting on it and everything like that
because I just feel like I'm at like a
weird awkward stage on my blog I redid
it I don't like how it looks it'll give
me more inspiration to get back into the
whole blog thing I don't know why I just
pulled up I just pulled up in the front
of CBS's if I'm just gonna run in kind
of park the car I was too excited
talking that I forgot to park the damn
car so I will be right back so I went in
for like those little mini black
elastics and of course they had every
color but the black they were sold out
in the black so I got rainbow one
something maybe I'll just do rainbow
ones so I'm just gonna head home do my
hair and I'll show you guys like a
little sneak peek of the closet there
was two main reasons why we're like oh
my god this is our house the one reason
was because when we went down into the
basement the whole basement was finished
and it was a complete gym so obviously
he took all of his equipment we're not
going to make the whole thing a gym but
it was just cool to see because her
breath that's like heaven so we're gonna
probably put up a wall and then Brett's
going to do his own gym down there that
was the first thing and then the second
thing was when you go upstairs it's one
two three four so there's four bedrooms
upstairs but the way that it is is that
when you walk up the steps to the left
there's like the two bedrooms and then
to the right there's one bedroom which
is my Beauty room and then the rest of
that side of the house is like the
master area like the master
yah-yah-yah so when we got it they had
the closet as one of the rooms they had
a whole unit in there that was a good
dark brown that they used for their
closet so that was there and then they
had a room connected to the closet that
was an office so there was desk and
everything in there and then there was
also another room attached to the closet
that was like I guess their baby room
they had like a couch in there and I
guess since they had like three kids
they made me just use it as like a room
to get away from the main bedroom so
obviously when I saw that I was like
okay so this is three closets it's three
closets and one so I ripped out the old
unit and I'm having them turn the doors
into big doorways that way it's all like
one big closet is just like abnormally
large which is perfect for me sorry I'm
just filming this whole car don't mind
me oh yeah
cool
crazy crazy so I just finished the hair
I got this new choker and I just felt
like it was appropriate to wear with my
hair like this
so getting like that Pocahontas fact
don't mind all this chaos behind me you
hear that do you guys want to quit
close-up on my clothes I'm not going to
show you anything yet to surprise still
but I'll give you a quick little skin I
only got half of the samples but you
guys can get a sneak peek a little bit
more than Instagram I'm not going to
show you anything for sure just so you
could see the color scheme we got going
on here I also forgot to mention to you
guys that my palette is going to be sole
or it is right now online on Ulta calm
which is so huge and July 31st it will
be in stores in all of the stores around
the u.s. but I haven't mentioned it yet
and honestly when I film I have so much
to talk about with you guys that I just
forget so I just want to let you guys
know if you didn't see already that it
is picked up by Ulta it's online on Ulta
right now and it will be in stores and
the price is staying at 1450 I know some
of you guys were asking that babes going
golfing
look at this golf outfit so we went
golfing for Father's Day and he was
killing it so I guess he's that's his
new thing so I guess today is just not
my day to film I really wanted to do my
smoothie video but we have the cleaning
ladies here today because of the sawdust
and everything all over the place we
wanted to get the place clean and they
ended up showing up before the guys
upstairs are done so I don't even know
what I'm gonna name this video it's just
gonna be a little vlog because I really
wanted to get something up before we
leave but I promise you guys as soon as
I'm back from LA and I don't have to go
anywhere for a while I'm gonna be back
on track and I can't wait for it what a
breath
a little baby net good what's gone on in
this household
pretty princess where's your brother I'm
worried where is this boy
just go look at yourself do you see it
do you see how pretty you look on camera
nicki manaj bears missing again I'm
trying not to freak out because this is
what I do yesterday he was missing for
literally an hour and a half I started
freaking out Brett wasn't home
we had the construction guys upstairs
and they were working in the Attic so
the steps were down from the Attic and
I've been in that room before when the
Attic was open and both cats have tried
to go up the stairs so it's so annoying
cuz he has his secret hiding spot and I
have no idea where he is
so I'm gonna go look for this little
poop check the draw that he was in
yesterday he's not there he's not in any
of his spots oh wait my boo bear people
have been in and out of my house all day
so now I'm like worried he's out
something double chin cam is he which
one which one you are
which one so not my one where all my
clothes are the one where you have your
clothes in it - all right good I'll
check in there I haven't checked there
someone's coming later although I know
let me go love you hi how are you I'm
good thanks uh yeah no I don't need that
thank you though appreciate it so I
called Brett and you so much make in the
background there you better be in here
buddy
kidding me in here how'd you even get in
this room the door was shut
daddy opened it for a minute and that's
what happens coming out up with that how
do you think you are keep running away
and sleeping everywhere talking to you
talking to you skinny legs going back so
nicely do not need it three together
always hating
didn't you get the fly soon you get it
get that fly
where did it go oh how did you know ah
ah send
you're gonna eat it you're gonna eat it
so I wanted to give you guys a little
bit of a vegan update it's been over two
months
I think the 17th could be wrong but I'm
pretty sure the 17th would be 2 months
and I feel like the one thing that oh
people always ask me is how are you able
to do it how are you able to give up so
much stuff and we've really found so
many vegan options for our favorite
meals so it's really been so so so easy
it is a lot of cooking at home preparing
your own meals but we like to go out to
eat too so one of my favorite things of
all time is sushi so we went and we
tried to find our best vegetable rolls
possible and we've gone like three days
last week I'm there all the time because
it tastes like my normal sushi and it
gives you that same effect of eating
sushi 2 rolls that I get are avocado
rolls and then I'll get an asparagus
roll with cucumber and scallion and I
just started getting also because Brett
was getting it it's avocado cucumber and
scallion all in one roll it is amazing
also the place that we go makes fried
rice for us they use oil no butter and
no eggs and there's a bunch of
vegetables in it and it's literally the
best fried rice I've ever had in my life
I also always get the house salad with
avocado on top when I leave there I'm
always stuffed and I always bring some
home so that's really exciting for me
because I feel like my number-one thing
is sushi like that was my favorite meal
the other favorite meal of course we're
like burgers like BBQ stuff like I love
I love going to like barbecues and just
having like a Manx burger I mentioned
that place veganized that has really
really awesome burgers there's also a
place in Union that we went to I forget
the exact name of it if you look up
vegan restaurants in Union New Jersey
you'll find it they have amazing burgers
you're going to veganize ask for the
burger with raw onion they do like a
sauteed onion or whatever and I prefer
it with raw onion I think it tastes a
little bit better it tastes more like
authentic in my opinion and Bret just
actually started buying the a me black
bean burgers I believe they are or I
know they have mushrooms in him they
have beans they've everything and he
made it the other night and we both had
two burgers they were amazing we put on
some lettuce some onions he mixes like
ketchup and vegan mayo to get like this
special sauce and
and she's been really good has been a
lot easier than I had expected it's not
just fruits and veggies there's lots of
price lots of beans pasta on occasion as
long as they're not made with eggs or
anything like that what else have we
really been eating lots of oatmeal lots
of soup oh my gosh this tomato soup that
we eat all the time I'll show you guys
the container because that's we're going
to have for dinner tonight which I'll
show you how he prepares that it comes
basically all done which is really easy
and then we just have bread with it I
have an eating gluten although we've
been trying to avoid it a little bit
more we were eating like this ground
taco meat and it looks like ground beef
but it was called like seitan or
whatever and it tasted just the same we
bought a post Isis and you throw that on
with some diced up Tomatoes some onions
some vegan cheese and throw it in a taco
and no one will know the difference um
what else have we been eating my
smoothie which I'm going to show you
guys Oh
we've gone there's like a Mexican
restaurant by us we've been going there
we got guacamole and then we get they
have vegetarian quesadillas so it's all
stir-fried veggies and we just asked her
it for no cheese so it doesn't say
together as nicely but it tastes amazing
so it really is easier than you think
going out and ordering food we've gone
so many places and we've always found
something that works for us so if anyone
tries to tell you you can't go vegan
because then you can't go out or you
can't just do normal things they're
wrong you can go anywhere you want to go
you just got to find some options lots
of french fries I forgot to add if
there's no food anywhere french fries
which of course they're not healthy all
in moderation but yeah it's really been
great I don't feel like I know a lot of
people say you get so much more energy I
don't feel that I feel like my skin
overall looks nicer but I've been
breaking out a lot but they say you
break out because it's your skin like
purging all of the crap that you've been
eating for so long so I guess we'll see
on that garden vegetable YUM so you see
it has all about she's already in it
favorite peanut butter it's really empty
this stash shoes these are literally
everything only like once in a while
because it's a lot of sodium
these chips jalapeno lime this is like
Doritos but if they're vegan early July
mmm literally - so good Rideau theme so
verbs I get the mock Amazon the best
chocolate chips you'll ever have in your
life smarter braised lentils all over my
clean pores boy your beans see what I
get for trying to show you what's in my
cabinet clicking Brett didn't shut it
they're everywhere anyway he's such a
character my gifts to personality huh
you're really cute little one
well we donate till fuzzy balls my
favorite part about her paws are these
hairs that come out of the bottom these
linked here's so fluffy you love hair
coming out of the bottom of you mother
fly got in Cindy's going to work
everyone just left
finally I don't even know what time it
is I think it's like 5:00 we have
literally no food in the house we have
knock on food shopping because we knew
we were leaving so when I tell you we
are literally completely empty so I just
decided to make some ramen noodles
because it's easy normally I would
probably have like some tomatoes and
hummus maybe like peanut butter sandwich
with some banana on it but we're out of
the peanut butter and my options are
limited so this time I put on the stove
it's so much better that way
it's the chicken flavor vegan ramen
don't mind my nails either by the way
mom this one's for you Missy mom that's
part about wearing sweatshirts you don't
need to use oven mitts
oh let me go show you guys the closet
they just finished they got to come back
on Saturday when we're not here I'm
gonna ask my mom I'm gonna ask my mom to
let them in they're coming to do the
molding and then I'm also having the
painter come because he's got a repair
everything and get everything ready for
Wednesday so Cindy you got another floor
did you get another one
ah so I don't know why that's still
there but this is the one opening that
was once a door so they made it higher
and I made it wider so as I was telling
you guys this was the closet the master
closet that was here they had units here
and here when we first got the place it
was all carpeted that's why you see
carpet there and there I had all the
carpet ripped up and I had floors put
down so when they ripped it up you could
see this crap underneath but the new
unit is probably going to come out to
about here anyway so it's all good on
this one you can see is nice and wide
it's so cool because with the door here
it was always really dark in here so the
Sun just brings in some nice lighting so
in here
this was their office I have a whole
unit that's getting installed on here
down the sides of the walls on that side
with a little window see and then also
on that side as well and then on this
side I figured I'd put like maybe like a
mirror they lose flying here one week
you'll get to see it all finished so I
thought it'd be cool to show you it
before and then that way you can see the
after and get the full effect
Oh pop this is a pic of me and my pop up
from last Father's Day miss you pops let
me show you I mean the cat foods that my
cats are obsessed with this one is
Cindy's a favorite she'll always eat
hers and then go for bears which she's
such a bully I just know this brand
Apple laws applause got a few different
flavors because they were loving these
they also are loving these they're like
the little layers so this one is like
tuna mackerel so it's like a double
layer I saw a lot of people asking if my
cats are vegan
of course they're not cats are
carnivores they need me I've looked into
it so I am buying meat products of
course for them but that's because they
need it and they're my babies be like
the one thing that people always say I
mean I would have said the same thing
before I actually started researching it
is that we're carnivores or that humans
need meat but the one thing that I
learned that I think is so funny is our
teeth the way that our teeth are so if
you look up animals that are carnivores
versus herbivores versus omnivores
you'll see that everyone's jaw and teeth
are different so just because we have
four little sharp teeth in our mouth
does not make us carnivores Brett's been
gone all day it's 6 p.m.
Spahn not gonna be home for another two
hours I've been editing my vlog as I am
vlogging some people think I chat too
much
I'm Chatty Cathy and just got my baby
from upstairs he was still sleeping in
that room thinking up there all day
you're gonna be up all night and mommy's
gonna be really upset with you you know
boo did I scare you um I just put a mask
on
it's the Irish more mud purifying black
mask the brand is Peter Thomas Roth
children that's my thing
when I was at Nicole's over the weekend
we went to Sephora and we picked up
these little samples of the masks this
one I haven't even mentioned my trip to
Florida can you guys take me seriously
if I'm talking like this um we had so
much fun so when we first moved Nicole
and Jeremy stayed with us and we were
literally like a few days in we like
just had a bed for them and that was
really yet and so we kind of did the
same thing to that we went and stayed
with them right when they moved into
their new house to celebrate I have this
lovely mask and I feel like this is what
happens when Brett's not home all day I
ends up doing like random things but I
bought this little microdermabrasion
thing it's by PMD so I just used this
because I noticed my skin was not
looking cute and then I put this mask on
over it
and I'm going to go finish editing the
rest of this blog so I can get it up for
you guys today and I'm going to also
throw the soup on because Brett's
running late from coming home from golf
so that is really my day I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope it wasn't too
boring let me know if you want more of
these or if you would rather me do vlogs
where it's like a couple days combined
so it's not just me like rambling all
day long but I love you guys so much
thank you for watching
babies hanging out with me I don't know
why this is my life today
dad ending my video came to get a snack
somehow they fell everywhere that's
twice today

thanks big ok now I need to go back to
editing because it's getting late all
right so it's gonna deep puff and it's
gonna loosen up as time goes like right
now it's just like massive because I
just took them out so you'll see as the
night goes on mature by the time I leave
