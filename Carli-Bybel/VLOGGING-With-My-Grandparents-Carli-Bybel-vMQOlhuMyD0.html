glad you liked it yeah I like this love
the hologram how was my house Harris
what did you do we face me finish me she
said everybody makes plans and God lifts
her saying Oh
everybody makes plans god bless in other
words then do it any make anything you
want but what's gonna happen it's gonna
happen regardless now I read you
very interesting and then it was fit as
winter and then it is winter you know
time has a way of moving quickly and
catching you unaware of the passing
years it seems just yesterday that I was
young just married and embarking on my
new life with my mate yet in a way it
seems like eons ago and I wonder where
all the years when I know that I lived
them all I have glimpses of how it was
back then and of all my hopes and dreams
but here it is the winter of my life and
it catches me by surprise how did I get
here so fast where did the years go and
where did my youth go I remember well
seeing older people through the years
and thinking that those older people
were years away from me
and that winter was so far off that I
could not fathom it or imagined fully
what it would be like but here it is my
friends are retired and getting gray
they move slower and I see an older
person now some are in better and some
worse shape than me but I see the great
change not like the ones that I remember
when who were young and vibrant but like
me their rage is beginning to show and
we are now those older folks that we
used to see and never thought we'd be
each day now I find that just getting a
shower is a real target for the day and
taking a nap is not a treat anymore it's
mandatory because if I don't on my own
free will I just fall asleep where I sit
and so now I enter into this new season
of my love I'm prepared for all the
aches and pains and the loss of strength
and ability to go and do things that I
wish I had done but never did but at
least I know that though the winter has
come and I'm not sure how long it will
last this I know that when it's over on
this earth it's not over a new adventure
will begin yes I have regrets there are
things I wish I hadn't done things I
should have done but indeed there are so
many things I'm happy to have done it's
all in a lifetime so if you are not in
your winter yet let me remind you that
it will be here faster than you think
so whatever you would like to accomplish
in your life do it quickly don't put
things off too long life goes by quickly
so do what you can today as you can
never be sure whether this is your
winter or not you have no promise
you will see all the seasons of your
life so live for today and say all the
things that you want your loved ones to
remember and hope that they appreciate I
love you for all the things that you
have done for them in all the years past
life is a gift to you the way you live
your life is your gift to those who come
after make it a fantastic one live it
well enjoy today do something fun and be
happy and have a great day
remember it is help that is correct real
wealth and not pieces of gold and silver
live happy this year and every year
lastly consider the following today is
the oldest you will ever be so enjoy
this day while it lasts
think about these things your kids are
becoming you going out is good but
coming home is better the things you
used to care to do you no longer care to
do but you really do care that you don't
care to do this you sleep better on a
last year with the TV blaring than in
bed it's called pre sleep you miss the
days when everything works with just an
on and off switch what used to be
freckles now liver spots everybody
whispers you have three sizes of clothes
in your closet two of which you will
never wear but old is good in some
things old songs old movies and best of
all all friends below isn't that
something yeah I thought come on oh did
you find this in we get a magazine 2

person I love you pop pop but you're a
very nice person too though it's just
you're always like worried about so many
other things
just living life for the day cuz you're
never guaranteed tomorrow night that's
right and you know time sure flies right
yeah it's true watching all those home
videos you're like oh it's true amazing
that's why say you live lift yourself
live while you can
but it does go very fast give me a hug

my bed it's like you could be 70 years
old but if you feel 40 your your your
mental age is 40 tanda and I even saying
