with Valentine's Day right around the
corner I wanted to get up a few looks
for you guys today I have a really
pretty golden bronze shimmery look um
what's great about this look is that you
can really do any color lip with it I'm
going to give you guys three different
lip options that I think would look
great with it
but I mean again feel free to use any
color that you feel comfortable with
before I get into this video I just
wanted to quickly let you guys know that
the company Princess Pea jewelry I'm
sure you guys have seen me mention it a
million times I went on and I picked a
bunch of my favorites and I created a
collection so I'm gonna link that below
if you guys want to go check out my
collection on the site these two
beautiful necklaces are from there as
well and I think they're so perfect for
Valentine's Day I do have a 20% off code
so everything is super affordable so I
will again link it below if you want to
go check it out also this pink satin
dress that I'm wearing here I'm obsessed
with I just got it from Nasty Gal so if
you guys want to see how I got this
makeup look please keep watching first
I'm priming my eyes with this eyeshadow
base the powder I'm using for my eye
shadow is the nude dude volume 2 by the
balm the first column using is the color
faithful and this is going to go all
over my eyelid I'm also going to be
dipping my brush in the mac fix+
to give it a really pigmented look
then I'm picking up the color feisty
with a large blending brush and I'm
blending it right into my crease
to highlight under my brow using the
color fabulous
to line my eyes I'm using the ink liner
by cat Bundy
For Lashes I'm using wispy sweet
nothings Bible or next I'm using this
Mac pigment in English gilt this is my
favorite part of the look we're going to
be using this on the lower lash line I'm
also going to be dipping my brush into
the fix plus I'm going to do three
colors on my lower lash line so this is
going to be the inner third then I'm
mixing these two together to do the
inner part of the lower lash line and
for the outer half I'm using the color
flirty and I'm using this white pencil
to line my inner lash line
so before the video started I did my
foundation and my concealer and I set my
concealer I also contoured my nose a
little bit and I did a little bit of a
cream contour on my face to set the
cream contour I'm going to be using the
contour palette this one's by BH it's
the sculpt and glow palette I'm going to
take this color right here and I'm going
to start contouring a little bit
for blush I'm using full-on femme by NYX
it's a mineralized blush I love these
blushes
and then to highlight I'm using this
master glaze by Maybelline you just put
a little bit on your finger and you
could put it right on your cheekbones
this is definitely one of my favorite
highlighters and you can get it right at
the juggler which is awesome I'm gonna
play a tiny bit right on my nose a
little right on my Cupid's bow so the
best part about this look is you can
really do a couple different lip colors
with it
it's really golde and bronzy so again
you can do so many different looks I'm
going to show you guys three options
that I personally love and I think that
would look great with it I'm wearing a
hot pink dress so I have a lipstick
that's going to match this this is going
to be the first one that I'm going to
show you but then I'm going to show you
two others just in case and yeah I mean
you can really do any lip color with
this so don't feel like you got to do
something bright you can always stick
with a nice nude color which you can
never go wrong with I'm not going to
show you guys a nude combo because I
feel like I always tend to stick with
nude lips so the first color I'm going
to be using is the which one is this oh
the Rimmel lip liner in the color pur
it's a nice hot pink and then over that
I'm using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
Carina liquid lipstick
so this is lip option number one so lip
option number two is going to be a
lighter pink I'm using my Sigma lovesick
lip base and I'm using OCC lip tar matte
in the color femme
it's actually a little bit too light for
my liking so I'm going to go back in
with my Milani lip pencil in the color
hot pink
so this is lip option number two and the
final color is not going to match my
outfit whatsoever but it's a beautiful
purple deep color that I think would be
gorgeous for Valentine's Day I'm using
the MAC lipstick in heroine and I'm
using the lip pencil also in heroine
although I don't approve of the name
so this is lip option number three
alright guys so that is the final result
I hope you guys enjoyed this makeup
tutorial I have another Valentine's Day
look coming up Monday for you guys it
was the picture that I posted a couple
days ago a lot of you guys are saying
you love the look so I'm so excited to
get that up for you guys as well I also
really quickly wanted to say thank you
guys so much for the amazing feedback on
my last vlog with my grandparents I'm so
happy that you guys loved it I'm so
happy that you don't mind that I'm going
to kind of find my inner and outer
beauty channel it's been very hard to
keep up with the second channel I know I
barely even post on there and that way
it can reach more people because I think
the inner beauty videos are just so
important and I know how much some of
you guys really love it so again please
comment below let me know if you guys
have any ideas on different topics you
want me to cover but until next time I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I love
you so much I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
