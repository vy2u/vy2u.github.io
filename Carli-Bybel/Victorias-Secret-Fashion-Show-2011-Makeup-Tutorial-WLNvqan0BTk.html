studio secrets professional magic
perfecting base all over my entire face
using a Mac dual fiber brush this is
going to give my face a really matte
finish like all of the Victoria's Secret
models
next I'm going to be using Revlon
age-defying makeup with the DNA
advantage in it I really really love
this foundation it's not too heavy and
it goes on very smoothly I'm going to be
applying this also with the dual fibre
brush make sure you get it into every
little crevice and also don't forget
about your neck
taking a concealer stick I'm going to be
filling in the dark circles underneath
my eye
using a foundation brush I'm then going
to be blending in this concealer with my
foundation make sure you're pressing
down very lightly with this brush
because you don't want it to blend in
too much because you do want it to make
a difference
then taking the same dual fiber brush
I'm then going to be blending in this
concealer so there are no sharp lines
then using Bare Minerals mineral veil
i'm going to be applying this all over
my entire face using the duo fiber brush
this is going to take away any shiny
appearance on my face it's also going to
set my foundation next taking maybelline
mineral power bronzer i'm going to be
contouring my face i'm going to be using
this mac brush and applying this on my
cheekbones
around my forehead
on the sides of my nose
and also underneath my chin
taking my Celia makeup palette and this
bright pink color I'm going to be
applying this as my blush by making this
face you'll see two little round circles
and those are the apples of your cheeks
where you're going to want to apply your
blush
I just got this new eyeshadow from Mac
it's for the holiday collection this is
called the smoky blue ornament dazzle
spheric election and I'm using the color
white as snow using a blush brush I'm
going to be applying this right on my
cheekbones to give myself a little bit
of a glow using a Mac shader brush and
this pearly white color I'm going to be
applying this all over my entire eyelid
as well as underneath my brow bone
then I'm taking fix+ by Mac this is a
setting spray but we could also use it
as if you spray it on your hand and you
dip it your brush into it it makes the
pigment come out a lot darker and makes
it look like a tin foil like a very very
high pigmented shadow so I'm gonna be
using this and then applying this right
on my eyelid
then using this light brown color I'm
going to be applying this right into the
crease of my eye
taking a mac blending brush I'm then
gonna be blending the same color right
into my crease blending and upwards this
year I noticed they're very neutral on
the eyes
and then taking my black fabula nur
liquid eyeliner from Jordana cosmetics
and I'm going to be applying this right
on my upper lash line there look this
year was a cat eye look so they had done
this their eyeliner like this
I'm going to be dragging the inner line
pass where my eye ends just to make my
eyes seem it longer
I'm then taking this light brown color
and applying this right in the crease as
well over my other color I had used
previously
taking a small angled brush and my
maybelline pout I'm going to be taking
this goldish color and applying this
right in the tear duct of my eye and
under my lower lash line going back to
that same light brown color I'm then
gonna be lining the rest of my under
lash line with this color
apply your mascara or false lashes at
this time
I'm then taking this lip liner by
Jordana cosmetics and outlining my lips
it's a skin tone color because they look
this year was very natural
I'm then going back to that seam white
pigment powder for my Mac Holiday
Collection applying this right on the
Cupid's bow which is right above where
your lip is this is gonna also highlight
your face
I'm using this light pink color on my
lips from beauty addicts you can add a
little more shimmer onto your lips as so
I absolutely loved the Victoria's Secret
Fashion Show this year as I'm sure you
all did as well I hope you like this
look and I hope that this helped out a
lot have a great day and thank you so
much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
