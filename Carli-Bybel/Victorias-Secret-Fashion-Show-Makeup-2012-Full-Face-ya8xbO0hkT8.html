Secret Fashion Show once a year everyone
knows about it I'm sure everyone watches
it as well I can't wait for it to air I
believe it's next week so I wanted to do
a makeup look before it aired I did see
some of the pictures that they had
posted online from this year and they do
it about a month before so that's why I
know what the makeup look was for this
year I feel like every year they kind of
go with a similar look nothing too
dramatic a champagne eye and a darker
crease so this is what I came up with so
if you want to learn how I got it please
keep watching
before I prime my face I'm using
deselect by Urban Decay and this is just
gonna help keep my makeup on you apply
three to four sprays and then this is
gonna help prep your makeup first is
this primer it's a photo finished color
correcting primer by Smashbox and I'm
also using my Mac dual fiber brush I'm
just gonna be applying a little bit on
my brush and applying this all over my
entire face
for a foundation I'm using L'Oreal True
Match Lumi this is a new one that I love
and also the dual fiber brush and I'm
just going to be applying this in
circular motions all over my entire face
next I'm taking my max skin finish and
this Bhoomi powder brush and I'm just
going to be applying this all over my
entire face
to highlight under my eyes I'm going to
be taking this Maybelline concealer and
I'm just gonna be applying a little bit
right under my eyes and also on the
sides of my nose to blend it in I'm
using this brush from Sephora I'll write
the number below in the description box
and I'm just gonna be blending this in
then taking my banana powder by Ben Nye
and this makeup sponge I'm going to be
applying the loose powder right
underneath my eyes and this is going to
set the concealer and help avoid any
creases using my brow bar on this Mac
brush I'm just gonna be contouring my
nose a little bit drawing a line and
then blending it in with my fingers if
you want to check out my contouring
video I will post a link below
taking the smack blending brush in that
same brown color I'm just going to be
contouring my cheeks by drawing a line
and blending it upwards her bronzer I'm
using true match cocoa and my Mac blush
brush and I'm just going to be applying
this on my cheeks around my forehead
under my chin and also on my neck
to give yourself a nice peachy pink glow
I'm going to be using peachy keen by Mac
and I'm just gonna be applying this
right on my cheeks
you just want to take your foundation
brush and just make sure everything is
blended in nicely one thing you'll
always notice about a Victoria's Secret
model is their face just glows so I'm
using soft and gentle by Mac and this is
a shimmer and it's just gonna add some
glow to your face and when it hits the
light it's gonna be like a shimmer
effect I love how this looks and it
gives it that nice dewy look
pry my eyes I'm using a concealer and
I'm just gonna be applying this all over
my entire island
using the same Mac skinfinish in soft
and gentle I'm going to be applying this
color all over my entire eyelid in my
tear duct and also under my brow
taking this light brown color from my
Maybelline quads strutted swayed I'm
going to be applying this with a Mac
blending brush right into my crease and
also blending it up around by my eyebrow
using my Mac gel liner I'm going to be
drawing a thin line on my eye and
winging it out
taking my Mack pencil brush in this dark
brown color I'm then going to be drawing
a line in my crease and blending it into
the eyeliner and also into the blended
part that I had just previously done
taking that same brown color and a Mac
blending brush I'm just gonna be
blending this in and I'm also gonna be
dragging this out one thing I noticed
this year as I did accentuate the brown
and make it a tail extend past their
eyebrow with a small angled brush I'm
going to be lining my lower lash line
with that same dark brown color
for mascara I'm using L'Oreal telescopic
as usual
for a lip liner I'm using Tony by
Jordana cosmetics
and for lipgloss I'm using the lip gloss
that comes with a Naked 2 palette from
Urban Decay so that is how I got my
Victoria's Secret inspired makeup look I
hope you all enjoy and please subscribe
