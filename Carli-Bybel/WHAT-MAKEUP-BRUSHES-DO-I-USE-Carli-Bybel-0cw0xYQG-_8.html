today's video I'm going to be talking
about my favorite and my most used
makeup brushes I know in a couple of my
last tutorials I saw a lot of people
requesting that I start mentioning the
brushes that I used in each tutorial
which I will do from now on so since it
has been so long since I have talked
about my favorite brushes I figured
that's what I would do in today's video
so if you want to hear what they are
then please keep watching so I have all
of my brushes separated in little mason
jars with pearls at the bottom I really
just had three I had two smaller ones
and one bigger one but bow jumps up on
my makeup counter and knocked it over so
it crashed everywhere broke and curls
were all run around for days so now I
have four little ones and I have them
all separated by like types of brushes
so like in this one I have all my
smaller brushes and that's what I have
in my blending brushes and my fluffier
brushes that I have as my foundation
brushes and some of my my contouring and
blush brushes in this one so first I
want to start with these brushes because
I feel like these are the ones that I've
probably been the most requested really
quickly I got some mason jars at
Michaels and then I got the pearls on
Amazon a lingam for you guys I just want
to be a really cute way to hold my
brushes besides the fact that I have
tile floors in here so if something
Falls it's going great so the first
thing I'm going to talk about is by
Sigma this is the round kabuki fa2 brush
and this is the brush that I've been
using lately to dust away and kind of
buff in the powder underneath my eyes so
what I apply my concealer and then I
apply my powder I use this brush to kind
of like left away the powder and just
kind of like blend everything in you can
also use this brush as a foundation
brush
honestly I don't even use a foundation
brush anymore I just use either a Beauty
Blender or my finger so I think for the
longest time
I felt lay foundation Russians were like
a necessity but again I feel like a
beauty blender is the best tool to apply
your foundation as well as your
concealer so these guys are in the
market for a good foundation brush try a
beauty blender before you out and buy
expensive brush if you want if you want
to use a brush of course all about
preference but for me I found that I
prefer and I always grab my Beauty
Blender over any other brush I also have
a mini version of that brush which does
the exact same thing I just have like
people cuz sometimes in here
this is the morphe g1 brush so either
one will do the trick
I go back and forth between the two of
them so the next brush I actually had my
bathroom because that was just using it
this is there's nothing left on it but
this is my morphe brush that I use and
almost every single one of my tutorials
I forget the exact number of it because
as you can see it's literally completely
gone but I believe it's like any dozen
maybe I will definitely list it for you
guys I use it for Pilates and for
bronzer I use it for powder I also use
it to kind of smooth out everything on
my face so this one I actually love it
so soft and silky and it just never
needs your face will be blocked G no
matter how much product is on your face
so this one and I also have the nv4
brush and it's a very so much brush but
it's more like a slanted brush so this
one is what I use for blush I definitely
use this one way more than this one but
I go back and forth between these two
angled brushes for my blush this is
these Sigma large angled contour brush
it's the f40 and this is the NV 4 so
again they're very very similar they're
both super soft this one you can even
use for contours is just a little bit
more slim these are the ones I always
always keep in front of me on my makeup
table I have like a bazillion brushes
but I'd like these ones are the ones
that I've been sticking light especially
for the past few months so these I love
for blush and
and I have the one that I use the most
for concert which I feel like everyone's
always asking about is this one and I
believe the bread and BBA beauty and
this is the b07 round contour brush so
this is the one I use the most to bronze
up my cheeks my forehead underneath here
it's just such a great front and very
firm I also have the one my Sigma which
is a similar shape as you can see this
is the small contour f05 but it's
definitely a lot more soft and it
doesn't apply as much cause I would say
this is the one I've definitely been
using more it's really all about
pressure and you guys like something a
little bit more soft and silky on your
face go for the Sigma brush but if you
want something that works just as well
but it slides a little bit more product
on then go for the b07
all the brushes that I do use are me
from synthetic hair I don't use any real
hair brushes of course so I just wanted
to point that out as well also really
quickly I just want to talk about this
little ring on my finger it's a
morganite ring so yes it was clicking
engagement ring a little bit a little
background agenda so when we were in the
Bahamas I really wanted to like find
this on the ring how they say like on
the island you've done and all that on a
lot cheaper so there was a store that
was selling morganite ring it's like a
really really pretty light pink and all
of you can see it from here so the
result looks sort I really really loved
but it was a little bit too pricy in my
opinion so we told the guys you know I'm
going to wait so we went back to the
room that day and my mom withheld a new
look and we found really really similar
ones on Angie and over socks or
literally half the price so I was like
that's crazy because the feeling when
Donny islands do always feel like you're
going to get a better deal so I knew I
really wanted to ring so I found them
very very similar on etsy so this is the
one that I found so I had ordered this
Lalo's in the Bahamas and I'm wearing on
my right
and I left hand and I'm going to treat
myself to a red
besides this and then my Opel one I have
like no real jewelry all my jewelry is
like cotton Julie which is totally fine
I always like lose things so I just like
always prefer like more affordable
costume jewelry but I decided to treat
myself to anyone wondering I was some
engagement rings on my right hand also
very quickly I just lifted up the place
that I found this ring on SP is olive as
jewelry so I will link her and to shop
for you guys who wanted to check it out
she has such beautiful stuff at really
great prices so next up I have this
brush right here at the morphe and four
three six brush it's like a dual fibre
brush and this one I use every single
time for my cream contour this I used to
blend out all of my cream products as
far as contour color so what I will do
is I'll apply the same cons on my cheeks
on my forehead on my jawline and also on
my neck and then with this brush you
just have to use very very light
pressure because it will one very nicely
I feel like whenever I'm using this
brush especially lately I'm like singing
of Bob Ross in my head very soft
tenkan stroke this one I use every
single time ending my makeup if I'm
using a cream product sometimes all
people over the cream I'll just go right
into the powder contour which obviously
I won't use this in that case but this
is definitely my most used brush next I
have my Sigma Foundation f60 brush and
this is what I use to apply my liquid
foundation also sometimes of cream
foundation what I will usually do
especially when I'm like in between
shades is I'll pump the foundation on to
my hand and I'll mix like one or two
shades and then I'll use this to blend
it together and then apply it all over
my face then I go in with my beauty
blender to blend everything in so of
course this brush is definitely use a
lot for me what you guys can also use
your fingers if you want to use one less
brush don't feel like you need every
single brush that I'm talking about so
this one I would say is not like a
must-have but I do use this one a ton
the next question I have actually
haven't used it in a little bit but it's
the RT which one all you the oval-8
brush and this one is really really good
for applying foundation as well like I
said
earlier I have been using the Beauty
Blender so this one I really haven't use
it as much that I did want to mention it
because it does apply your foundation
beautifully if you guys are more on the
beginner side and you're not really sure
how to get your foundation to look
flawless this brush really does a lot of
the work for you and the next brush I
recently started using and I absolutely
love it this one is by Tarte and it
doesn't have a number or anything on it
I've been using this end a lot and I've
been using this to blend out like my
nose contour and also I can feel it a
little bit so I really really love this
brush so next up I have my larger
blending brushes the most views are
definitely these these are the larger
blending brushes they're both my Sigma
they are the tapered blending the e-40
brushes I just have them in like
different colors so these are used
literally every single day I use them in
my crease and I use it to apply all of
the shadows and all that so these are
amazing I can go a day without these for
sure even something like a natural look
I'll use like a little bit of my bronzer
dip it in and apply it in my eyes to
realize I open up my eyes these are
definitely a necessity and anyone's
can't whether you are doing makeup for
yourself or if you're doing makeup on
other people as well then I have these
smaller blending brushes I have one from
Sigma the e25 brush and i also have the
morphe m 433 so there are literally
exactly the same I use for like the
outer V just anything I want to get more
precise control with whereas the larger
one is more for like a bigger area
these are definitely a necessity in a
kit as well you don't need two of each
brush I have way more than two of these
for us but I always like to keep two out
so when one's very elbow for the other
one next up I have these two brushes
that I also use all the time and
probably can't go a day without using
them one is the sigma e55 shader 52 so
they both have a very flat edge like
this and I use these to apply a
foundation powder
my eyes so as technologies like he kept
on me foundation powder usually too late
Brian up underneath my eyes and also on
the sides of my nose these brushes take
up a lot of product and you can put them
in like the precise areas for instance
on the sides of my nose where I contour
I like to keep it really light on the
side to really make my nose Atkin more
narrow so these I can't go a day without
I feel like I use this one a little bit
more than this one but again I go back
and forth so next I have my Sigma e-40
spine paper at the lending brush this
one I also use every day this is what I
use to contour my nose so I will always
do the cream contour first for my nose
and then I'll go in with a powder with
this brush every single time so then
that is paper at the top and it goes to
like a point and makes where I apply the
powder much more precise so I'll just
dip it very lightly into the powder and
then I like hold it like this and then
just go right over those lines and it
just comforts the nose perfectly so next
up I have my marquee 20 brush this is
what I've been using to apply powder
underneath my eyes so sometimes I'll use
my Beauty Blender as well but if I want
to use my media under like later on and
I don't want all that extra powder on it
I'll use this brush I've been using this
one a lot lately I used it today as well
so what I'll do is I'll scoop a bunch of
powder I'll blend out the creases with
my Beauty Blender and then I'll go right
in and push that powder right into my
skin so it's just a perfect size and the
perfect shape that it fits like right
here perfectly so we want to apply that
powder underneath your eyes it'll really
really set it nicely and then last but
not least I have my little mini brushes
I'm going to talk about these two over
first these are both but they're
basically exactly the same I believe do
some lip brushes this one is the morphe
M 170 - 4 and this one I look for you
guys but there's literally nothing on it
but I always use these to apply any
highlight on my nose I also use this to
apply the highlight in my tear duct
underneath my brows and also my butters
and also my Cupid's bow and all that so
any
you want my really precise highlighting
this is what I will use the next brush
is also in our teeth brush this is the
circle one R and this is the one that I
use to blend out my nose contour this
brush is really really great to have
such a small little head so it's good to
like do kind of like circular motions to
blend out the cream contour I'm sure
there's like a million other uses for
these brushes I'm sure if you look on
the site they'll tell you but for me
what I use it for personally was my nose
contour so the only shadow brush that I
used to apply anything like all over my
lids in the Sigma it's actually
concealer brushes the x70 brush and
again I apply any shadows right onto my
lid or also even the head into my brow
and when we use this one brush next I
have the 9 to 10 brush this brush you
can also use for your eyelids or what
I've been using this lately for is a
cream contour brush to contour my nose
well just like dip it into the cream
contour and then draw the lines and then
draw up the tip so it kind of like
darkens it a little bit I don't really
know what this brush is made for I kind
of like to make up my own uses for them
but I use this almost every single day
as well so for eyeliner I use the Sigma
e 10 and I also use me more feed to 50-1
I would have to say the morphe one is
kind of like on its last couple of days
it's had its time I have to like trim it
and like cut the little straggler
sometimes because they're like some
parts just like stick straight out not
or what I do but I actually just got a
new Sigma one the e10 because these ones
are a little bit left hair a little
thinner so I have two more the second to
last is the RTS oval 3 this is the other
one that I would use to blend out my
nose contour I would say if I had to
pick one I would definitely pick this
little one with the round tip over this
one and left at least I have my Sigma
pencil brush this is the e30 brush and
this is just your regular like pencil
brush
I've used this always always underneath
my
I supply the lower yeah Sarah I shut up
I feel like I can't go a day without
eyeshadow on my lower lashes like if I'm
applying anything in my crease I always
have to match it or something similar on
the lower lash line
it just preference but yeah I always
always use this brush is perfect it
takes up a lot of products and it's also
good for blending and like smudging out
the bottom line so they're like my most
most used brushes as far as Beauty
blenders I love the hot pink one I go
back and forth between the black ones
and the pink one but I think I had
recently just was black one and the
texture felt different and I feel like
it didn't work as good so I don't know
if I got like a fake one or what
happened but I like the pink one it is
my go-to I had way more of them before
beau came and so all of my beauty
blenders - the beauty blender thief he
thinks they're toys for them so if I
ever leave my door open I'll come in and
all money butters you find like I'm
shove them in some layers are literally
gone it's so funny I'm those kinds of
brushes that I use every single day
they're my most views they're the ones
you've seen a million times in my
tutorials I wanted to get this video up
that way you guys are ever questioning
anything and you need to know which
questions I'm using you can come back to

using in my videos in my tutorials as
well make your life a little bit easier
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
