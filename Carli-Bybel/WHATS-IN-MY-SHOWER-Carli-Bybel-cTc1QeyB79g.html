today's video I'm going to talk about
some of my in shower products I don't
think I've ever got a video like this
and when I was thinking of what to film
today I kind of just kept popping up in
my head and also if you know what maybe
people are interested in what I use in
the shower so I figured have to go
through some of the products that are
currently in my shower now some of them
are new some of them are a little bit
older so if you guys want to hear what
they are please keep watching so the
first part I wanted to talk about is
this dr. teals pure Epsom salt soaking
solution this is the eucalyptus and
spearmint one I picked this up from
Hartman's about when what's left three
weeks ago I actually took a really nice
bath the other night it was just so
relaxing so soothing and smell that is
just so amazing that I almost fell
asleep which is not good but what you
can also do and what I did actually last
night is if you mix it a little bit of a
handful with your body wash you can
create your own exfoliating scrub and it
all up get rid of dry skin and all that
good stuff but it also has the essential
oils and it helps to ease aches and
muscle pains it says I also like to just
keep this in my shower open because it
helps release the aroma therapy so I
don't know if you're really supposed to
do this it like that but as long as it's
not getting water inside it should be
fine they also have this like a lavender
version which I picked up as well which
lavender helps you sleep so if you want
to split a nice relaxing bath before bed
try out the lavender one as well I
smelled both of them I decided to choose
this one giving it because we were out
late the night before and my whole body
was just aching all over it was my
birthday on Thursday so Thursday to
Sunday we were out doing a million
things so Sunday night I took this nice
bath and it literally changed my life
the next product I mentioned
in a favorites video I believe this is
by darpa II it's the sir is my body wash
I bought this originally at I think it
was Wedman whose either weapons or whole
foods I bought it twice I also bought
the body lotion to go along with it and
I mention in my favorites video and then
I just got a box in the mail with like
six of these body washes and I'm stocked
up for life which is just awesome but
this is actually my third bottle that
I've gone through it's already empty I
need to open up a new one but this is
really good for anyone with eczema
psoriasis or really sensitive skin
believe me when I say I used to use the
best smelling everything that Victoria
Secret love spell by washing lotion used
to be my favorite thing in the entire
world but I noticed when I used anything
with a strong fragrance not only did I
sometimes get a nosebleed in the shower
which has happened many times but I
never set my eczema got a lot worse so I
would say probably the past three years
I have not used anything with fragrance
I got rid of dryer sheets I got rid of
anything when fragrance dies any guts up
and I've just been trying to transfer
over to and more healthy alternative
because I come up and you guys don't
ever see it but here is some on my hand
I always get them in certain spots and I
noticed obviously I have a lot to do
with my diet so some of these products
won't work if you're not worrying about
what's going into your stomach so I
don't want to say go buy this product in
your asthma or psoriasis will be healed
because unfortunately that's not the
case I've yet to still find something
that's cured it but I do notice that
what I am eating healthier and I'm using
these products along with it it does
help clear my eczema up so much better
so this I absolutely love and I
recommend so I do have another body wash
that goes in my shower I guess I kind of
I don't go back and forth I really love
the derma e one better because it gets
more like soapy suds E and you feel like
super clean where this one is kind of
like a weird consistency but I'll always
use this whenever I'm taking a shower I
always wash my face in the shower but if
I have makeup
I don't like going right in with my
exfoliating cleanser because I think
like you're just moving around that
makeup exfoliating the makeup into your
skin so I always use this on my face
before I use my exfoliating cleanser so
this is why I still have that in my
shower but to be honest as a body wash I
definitely prefer the other one because
again I feel more clean after wear this
one feels more like a lotion so I do
still use this one a lot
the CeraVe brand is amazing I did use a
syrupy body lotion as well when I get
out of the shower so I recommend this
brand again for anybody with eczema or
psoriasis this brand is accepted by the
National eczema Association so I always
look for something with that little tag
to make sure that it'll be good for my
skin so I don't remember exactly how
long ago it was I did an updated hair
care video but I recently stopped using
the shampoo and conditioner that I was
using forever ever since I got my card
in treatment I got the GK keratin so I
was using the same brand shampoo and
conditioner but when I started like
really really thinking about it I
noticed I might end coming off a lot
worse after I started getting the
keratin treatments so I haven't gotten a
card in treatment in quite some time I
don't know if I'm definitely going to do
it again as much as I really loved it
but I stopped using a shampoo and
conditioner because I figured maybe
something that's in the shampoo and
conditioner is affecting my eczema more
often than I would like because
obviously you only get the keratin that
mulch or twice a year so I stopped using
that shampoo conditioner altogether
although I did love the smell of it but
I recently picked up this shampoo it's
by a cure it's a volley
shampoo pure mint and you can asia stem
cell and sense of volume for normal to
find limp hair so obviously my hair is
not really limp or fine but since i do
have that peritreme and i noticed my
hair is not as puffy and volumous as I
would like that's why I decided to pick
this one up I also decided to pick it up
because it's vegan and gluten free
sulfate free carbon free something I
can't pronounce pretty cruelty free a
petroleum free PG free synthetic
fragrance free so hungry one clogged
pores and it's a hundred percent
biodegradable so just seeing all of that
on the label was like you know what this
is the one I'm gonna go for so I picked
this one out so far so good it has a
minty smell to it which I actually
really like it's kind of relaxing um and
I like to use that for my shampoo so
this is most empty I do need to pick up
another one of these for conditioner
lately I have been using the by OSH
hydro source I used to use this shampoo
conditioner all the time when I was like
in high school when my mom was still
buying me my supplies these products are
a little bit more pricey than your
average drugstore product but I'm going
to beyond percent on this the reason
that I think this went up again I also
picked it up on our set barman's is I
just love the smell of it and I feel
like 99% of everything that I use has no
scent to it because of my sensitive skin
but I just been eating this for
conditioner because a Island smelled it
and B just leaves my hair so soft and so
shiny and
really love it I like to apply about
like this much to my hair I love
conditioner I obviously focus mostly on
the ends but then I also bring it up to
almost my roots as well because I just
like when my hair is all really soft and
yeah I mean who doesn't love soft hair
so that is my conditioner - my go-to one
right now umm if you guys have any
recommendations let me know because I'm
always looking for different ones but
this is just an old old favorite that I
wanted to try out again and the smell is
just contagious so that's the one that I
recently picked up the next thing in my
shower is this little brush that I had
mentioned also in my favorites video
it's a tangle teezer it's called I just
use this after I wash out the
conditioner I brush out my hair that way
I don't the brush my hair once I'm out
of the shower I know I saw some people
saying that it's not good to brush your
hair wet but I think that's very
unrealistic for most people because I
don't know for me I could never brush my
hair when it's dry because it's not here
I feel like more hair falls out and then
it gets frizzy so I always like to just
brush my hair in a shower whether it's
my way or the wrong way that way the
brush gets all the clumpiness of your
hair it doesn't allow to fall so it's
not going to pop up your drain it's not
going to get all over your floor it kind
of just keeps it all on the brush and
then you just got MZ of the brush every
time or every other time so this is
another thing that I love and I
recommend
and one looking for a good rush I
explained really why I like it in my
favorite video but I like that it's made
out of plastic so nothing on it is going
to stay wet so if I'm gonna start
smelling if I'm gonna gather bacteria or
anything like that and um yeah just keep
it running the ledge of my shower the
next product is my current face wash
this is by Keenan Austin it is the face
and body retexture scrub this is really
good for acne or age spots for
exfoliating so I've been using this
product for about three weeks now so far
so good I will keep you guys posted I
did break out a little bit when I first
started using it but I feel like it's
because it's really bringing out all the
crap that's been stuck in my pores so
again I won't keep you posted but this
is currently that's been in my shower so
I wanted to share with you guys so for
about a year I was using a regular razor
with these sensitive heads and it's very
very expensive and I was liking how it
worked
but I just noticed that wherever I would
shave the most that's where I would get
my eggs some of the most I feel like
anything I use on my skin it's like I
noticed it brings out my eyes a little
bit more it's gone out of my life so the
reason that I wasn't using I ended up
having the thrown wife after about a
year because I noticed the certain areas
out of shaving man commodes getting
worse and even though it was a sensitive
head on the razor I feel like just maybe
something that was like that cushion on
the race or something in it my skin was
reacting to so I picked up these little
Gillette Daisy razors I just use these
in high school my mom has always used
these they're just ones that I've always
went to so in the area that I notice my
was going away where I shame when I
switched back to this razor I noticed
that it didn't clear up a lot quicker so
I don't know for sure if it was the
razor that was above my eczema because
again like I said there's so many
factors and it's so hard to really
pinpoint it but I do notice that using
these disposable razors since you do
only use them like two or three times it
seems to be better for my skin which is
super sensitive so if you guys have
really sensitive skin maybe try using a
disposable razor that way you're not
using the same head maybe more times
than you should have because they're
gonna be bacteria that stuck in your
razor and I guess when you're reshaping
you're opening up your pores and it's
just really gross to think about so
again these are the ones that I've been
using the ones that I've loved forever
they only get who uses out of them so
they're not permanent razors but in my
opinion they're worth every penny and
they get the job done and then the last
thing that's in my shower is this cute
little loofah um I actually got these
since my field walks I have another one
in my drawer I'm gonna check the brand
name for you guys so it's like a double
blue phone so you can use this or you
can pop it out and just use this and
what it's done the packaging is that no
bacteria will form in this little puff I
guess it's the material that it's made
up or something like that so I'm like
okay perfect I need in my life I don't
know I always buy little puffs and when
they sit on the shower floor for too
long I like going and I like look at
like I trust it but when I got these in
my appeal box I was like anyway I'm
gonna try she's saying no bacteria
conforming that maybe it'll be a little
bit better so this is the one that I've
been using for about two months and yeah
so that is basically it as far as what
is in my shower I always prefer to take
showers at night and the reason for that
I always like to go into bed
super clean my sheets are clean cotton
cleaning a sleep better I don't know
through the years I've gotten like super
neurotic bacteria and all that kind of
stuff so I just like to be all Klingon
before I get into my bed also I learned
to shower at night because the way I
like to do my hair is I like to go to
bed with it
wet I put it in a braid and when I wake
up it has also loose waves like this I
only curled like the front pieces with
an iron but everything else you're
seeing is just natural waves from my
braids that I put in last night I know
whenever I mentioned when I shower
people get grossed out they're like
hanging up shower morning and night or
how to not shower morning and everyone's
different everyone has their reasonings
for doing certain things my theory makes
sense in my head and I prefer shower at
night I feel like my shower in the
morning one day forever gets started and
it's a blow dry my hair this into that
so that's just my preference but that is
really it for now I hope you guys
