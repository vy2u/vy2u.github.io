today's video I transformed myself into
Wonder Woman so I have been dying to
recreate this look ever since the movie
came out so today it's finally the day
just in time for Halloween so if you
guys want to see me transform into
Wonder Woman then please keep watching
to start off today's look I'm using the
cover FX learning primer the foundation
today I'm using the Fionna styles matte
foundation to contour my nose and my
face I'm using the darkest shade from
the graftobian high def glamour cream
warm palette number three so I'm gonna
use this to contour my nose so obviously
in the movie she's super natural and I'm
gonna keep the eyes really natural but
whenever I do like a natural look I
still always like to do a cream contour
just because it kind of chisels out your
face and yeah so I'm gonna do my nose
first
we're just gonna blend all of that in so
I fill my daenerys targaryen or i
refilmed it right before the season
finale and so many of you guys really
loved that look so when I did Harley
Quinn again I got a really good reaction
from you guys I had already ordered this
costume and what I did a little late
that's why this video is going up a
little bit late it's a custom-made
costume but I feel like you guys really
like the transformations that I've been
doing so I ordered one other like
superhero costume I feel like it won't
be here until the day after Halloween
but I might just do it anyway so let me
know if there's anyone else in
particular you would like to see me
transform into I love Wonder Woman I was
Wonder Woman for Halloween I like five
or 60 years ago but the newer Wonder
Woman came out not too long ago so when
I was searching for costumes for my
videos this year I found this guy who
custom makes these Wonder Woman costumes
and it's like insane like the quality is
like the movie quality his name is Jason
I'm gonna link all his info for you guys
below for concealer I'm using the Tarte
shape tape and medium
so my sister's bridal showers coming up
next weekend so I've been so crazy
planning it and getting all the stuff
together and making different
decorations and stuff like that so I'm
gonna do a little bit more right on the
sides and with this tart brush I'm going
to blend in the nose contour she has a
much smaller nose than me in the movie
and obviously real life so I'm gonna be
contouring it as I normally would to
make it look more narrow and to give the
tip like a little bit of like a lifted
look so I'm going to smooth out any
wrinkles under my eyes and then I'm
going to set it
I'm gonna just use a little bit of this
bye-bye breakout full coverage concealer
this is by it cosmetics I've been using
this probably about a month or so just
to cover pimples I feel a little bit
better covering them because it has like
acne medication in it so while that is
setting I am going to do my brows so in
the movie she has really strong dark
brows which I love so I'm gonna pull up
a picture just so I can make sure you
get the shape right in so I'm using my
Anastasia brow Wiz in the color granite
so whenever I'm trying to do like a
transformation it always helps keeping
the picture right in front of you that
way you don't go overboard and you can
try and keep it as close as possible so
we're pretty even I guess I'm gonna use
my evany brow powder to fill them in a
little bit more
I love the brows as a way to shape them
perfectly without making them too too
too dark and then I just like to go in
with the powder to darken up like
certain areas you want them to look
natural so you want to keep the inner
like the part closest to your nose
lighter than what you're gonna do for
the rest of the brow that way you're
keeping them or just changing the shape
of them you want them again to look as
natural as possible I'm going to take my
Kat Von D shade and light palette I'm
using the first color the grey or tone
and a little bit of the middle color and
I'm just going to go over the nose
contour lines before I lick the powder
away and the reason I like to do this
first is because if it's a little dark
the powder will help blur it out a
little bit as well so using the same
brush I'm just gonna wipe away the
powder
with a little bit of my Kat Von D powder
in medium 57 I'm gonna apply that
underneath my eyes just to brighten a
little bit more taking the same powder
in a little bit of a darker shade we're
just gonna go right over the nose
contour Brittany's a little bit of the
middle shade from the shade and light
palette just a little to add a little
bit of contour
so of course I just in my eyes and it
wasn't filming so I'm gonna wipe it off
so I can redo it for you guys um luckily
it wasn't anything crazy
it must have stopped recording without
me even realizing I did highlight my
nose as well as my Cupid's bow a little
bit so that I can't wipe off but you
guys did something to that a million
times I just used like a little brush
and the gold shape from my palate so
that's so I'm using my Carli bybel
pellet for today's eyeshadow look in the
movie I don't think she even has any
eyeshadow on just a little bit of
eyeliner and mascara but I'm gonna do a
little bit of shadow like very very
little bit just to add a little bit of
depth into my eyes so I'm going to use
my Sigma e-40
and this matte shade right here and I'm
gonna blend that right into my crease
and this brush makes everything easier
because literally all you do is just
very light back and forth strokes right
into your crease and then you can blend
it up towards the brow a little bit on
the lid as well and you can just see it
adds a little bit of shadow so we're
gonna do the same thing on the other
side we're gonna kind of connect it to
the nose contour as well and that way
everything just flows really nicely so
I'm using my morphe 35o is to highlight
my nose I also highlighted it a little
bit under my brow it's kind of still
there here and here I used this shade
right here which is one of my all-time
favorite highlighters so I'm just gonna
pick up a little bit of this matte nude
shade and I'm gonna apply that right on
the lid just to brighten it up a little
bit and I'm focusing it more like in the
inner part
and then in the movie she has a black
eyeliner very very small wing like
barely there so I'm gonna use my
Charlotte Tilbury the feline flick liner
and I'm going to apply it super thin
like that I don't know why I'm in deja
vu right now like really bad it's so
weird so you can just do regular mascara
if you want but I personally always love
a little bit of a lash so I'm gonna use
my normal little wispy lashes I was
trying to find my Ardell wispies cuz
they're a little bit shorter but of
course I couldn't find them so I'm
choose these they're pretty
natural-looking so I just cut like two
sections off so they fit my eyes
perfectly so while the glue is drying
you guys should have seen what happened
so this costume came today and like I
said it's custom so I had sent my
measurements and everything and the
corset it was just way too big so I got
the custom around 11 o'clock this
morning and again it was too big and I
was like oh like I waited so long for
this like I really wanted to look good I
don't want to look like really wide I
want it to be like a real corset where
it's gonna like suck me in a little bit
so I texted the guy who made the costume
and he told me what supplies that I
needed to fix it so I went to Home Depot
we FaceTime for about an hour and I
fixed the corset so now it fits
perfectly so I've had a little bit of a
late start today it's like 4 o'clock
right now so hoping I can still get this
up today if not tomorrow morning latest
but you guys should have seen me like I
put a lot of time into trying to make
this perfect for you guys so I hope you
like this look I'm gonna glue these bad
boys on so next comes the mascara this
one's by buxom it's the lash mascara I'm
gonna do a little bit
with the darkest brown matte shade from
my palette I'm going to apply that
underneath my eyes close to the lash
line
I'm with a little bit of the lighter
matte shade from my palette
I'm just very lightly dragging that
under just to blend it a little bit give
it a little more dimension this part
again is optional it's just something I
like to do it makes my eyes look a
little bit bigger so I'm using the gold
highlight shade in my palette to
highlight under my brows a little bit I
already did it before and it didn't
really wipe off but just to show you
guys again obviously she doesn't want
highlighter in the movie but we can add
a little bit of shimmer why not and if
we are if you're a contouring your nose
I highly recommend highlighting it as
well just because maybe like it doesn't
look right otherwise I'm gonna do a
little bit of bottom mascara but just
like a tiny bit and then for lips it
almost looks like she just says like
chapstick on a little bit of a gloss I'm
gonna try and find something similar
though so for lips she has like a very
light pink
it almost looks just like her natural
lip color so I'm going to line my lips a
tiny bit with og Lolita lipliner and her
bottom lip is a lot bigger than her top
so I'm not gonna over line my top line
like I normally would and for lips I'm
just gonna use a little bit of a cream
blush this one's by Ashley Tisdale and
I'm just gonna Pat it on and I'm gonna
use a little bit of this pink blush
through my cheeks
so that is it as far as makeup next
we're gonna curl the hair I bought this
like a year ago I haven't used it it's
the hot tools curling iron but I take
the longer one for longer hair so I'm
gonna use this one today I use the
regular irons all the time so I'm not
worried it's gonna work and this is a
one inch barrel what it's a smoking so
literally just open this up out of the
box and smoke is coming out of it yeah
I'm not gonna use this guy because I
don't trust it
so that's annoying so we're gonna try
this again I have the same on just like
the shorter version I was excited to try
the longer one because my hair is like
very long so I was just wearing like
that little head piece as a headband
because I can't do my makeup without a
heavy on but I'm not gonna show you guys
when I curl my entire head but I'm going
to show you like the bottom half and
then I'll go up into the front pieces to
show you guys that as well
so I always like to just split it down
the back and bring it all in the front
push it with your fingers and then this
is probably a small section I can do it
all in one so once your iron is heated
up you're just gonna start at the top
and I always like to hold it at the top
a little bit so you just kind of slowly
feed it through let it sit till you feel
like the heat coming through and then
just continue
I always like to kind of like to scrunch
it in a little you'll feel how hot it is
and by squeezing it all together until
it kind of cools a little bit it's gonna
help keep the shape of the curl so these
are the type of curls that you want like
super bouncy curls so I'm gonna do the
same thing on the other side start at
the top and let it sit same thing just
hold it up scrunch it until it cools
down a little bit and I'm gonna repeat
the same thing all the way up so I will
be back in a minute when I finish I'll
show you guys how I do the front part of
my hair so my hair is like so long it's
really hard for the curls to actually
hold because I like no layers so I
actually just plucked in my one inch
wand because it might be a little bit
easier to curl like the top parts but
I'm gonna do the top layer and then
we'll see like what parts we have to fix
so I'm gonna part it down the middle
just to curl it I like to do it first
down the center and then like flip it
because it'll give it a little bit more
height and volume I'm gonna pin it to
cool that way it lasts a little bit more
yeah so this is crawling it so much
better so I'm gonna say go with the one
for this hairstyle since you want it
super curly I don't know I'm so used to
using this one and making like big
weaves that like I wasn't sure how curly
I could actually get it yeah
I'll just get so much hotter to
curl the Frog keys so you want to curl
it away from your face
so next come the headband which look
guys it covers my pimple perfectly and
it's gonna go under the hair and
Amazonian my god you look like an Amazon
woman well sure right
pretty cool looks legit totally totally
did you through your whole film already
um I'm still filming right now so much
needs a little bit of hairspray
so I'm gonna go put on the full costume
and this is the final result I hope you
guys enjoyed this video have a very safe
Halloween and till next time I'll see
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
