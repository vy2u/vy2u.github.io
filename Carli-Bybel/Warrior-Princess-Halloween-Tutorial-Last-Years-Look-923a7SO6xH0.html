last year for Halloween me and Brett
decided to be Spartans and I guess it's
kind of just like a warrior or something
of the sort but I saw a ton of you guys
asking for a makeup tutorial and where
did I get my costume and all that stuff
so I figured why not recreate the whole
lot that I did last year for any of you
guys may be interested in being what I
was last year
so my costume is actually a Princess
Leia slave costume it wasn't a Spartan
costume but when I found Bret's costume
online and I saw this one I just thought
it could pass as a warrior costume so I
think if you just really accessorize it
right and you just make it work you can
really turn any costume into anything so
this is exactly how I did my makeup and
hair last year so if you guys want to
see how I created this look please keep
watching first I'm using this NYX pore
filler primer and this is just going all
over my face for foundation I'm using by
million-dollar tan the shade upgrade
along with my Chanel foundation I'm
mixing the two together and it's going
to give my foundation a nice bronzy
color because I had applied some
self-tanner
to fill my brows I'm using my brow bar
to go they now come in two colors so I'm
using the darkest shade next I'm
applying clear brow gel just to hold
down my brows using this lip brush by
Sigma and that same brown shade from my
brow bar I'm going to be contouring my
nose using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour palette I'm going to be
contouring my face
you
moving on to my eyes I'm using the
makeup forever flash palette I'm taking
this gold color and I'm applying it all
over my eyelids
next using a big fluffy blending brush
and these two purple colors from my pH
120 palette I'm going to be applying
this right into the crease of my eye
you
you
you
picking up the darker purple in this
black shade with a smaller blending
brush I'm then going to be blending that
right into the crease of my eye and then
up into the lighter purple shade that's
higher up in my crease
next I'm lining my eyes with my Sigma
black gel liner and my eyeliner brush
grabbing this dark purple shade with my
pencil brush I'm then lining my lower
lash line
for this look I'm wearing my Mac 35
lashes and then I'm applying my L'Oreal
telescopic mascara over that
picking up a little bit of that black
color with my pencil brush up and then
going over that purple line just to
darken it a bit
moving onto concealer I'm using this one
by Makeup Forever and I'm applying it
with a brush right under my eyes then
I'm grabbing this tiny little Beauty
Blender and I'm going to blend it all in
you
you
you
picking up a little bit of my laura
mercier concealer I'm been taking this
bigger blending brush and then just
blending out all of the highlighted
areas
to set my concealer i'm using the color
banana by anastasia beverly hills with
his big fluffy brush I'm taking a little
bit of my Laura Mercier bronzer and I'm
just bronzing up my face grabbing my
foundation brush I'm just going to be
blending in all of the work that I just
stand to learn no sharp lines moving on
to highlighter I'm using Mac whisper of
guilt just to highlight my cheekbones
to add a little color on to my cheeks
I'm using my Revlon blush in the color
why not moving on to lips I'm going to
do a light pink color so I'm using this
Milani lip pencil then over that I'm
using a tiny bit of fruit punch by
Milani and on top of that I'm using by
Gerard cosmetics the nude lipstick and
this is going to give you a really
really pretty light pink color
the final step is just to add some
glitter onto your eyes this part of
course is optional but since it is
Halloween why not go a little bit crazy
I'm using this gold glitter from BH I'm
going to add a little bit of gold
lanyard into my hair last year I
definitely put a little bit more in but
I'll just show you guys basically how
you do it that way you want to add a
little bit more feel free but it's just
going to add a little bit of a gold
accent into your braid which is going to
give it a really pretty look so I'm just
braiding my hair normally putting
elastic at the bottom and then just pull
out the strands of the braid to make it
nice and thick and pull out a little bit
of that gold and it'll give it a nice
little accent so this is the final
result I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you are being something with
these colors in your costume feel free
to do this for any other look I just
decided to bring in the Purple's because
the dress part or the bottom half is
like this deep purple so this was the
look that I came up with last year I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
do recreate this look definitely hashtag
me I want to see how amazing it looks on
you guys so yeah I think that is it for
now
please comment below let me know which
characters you want me to recreate for
Halloween I will not be doing anything
scary because I've just never been the
type of person to want to dress up scary
for Halloween I know maybe Halloween is
meant for scary things but I am just
literally afraid to even be home by
myself I always think there's monsters
hiding under my bed
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and until next time I'll see you guys
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
