back today with another video for you
guys and I wasn't really sure what to
film so I was looking through a bunch of
your suggestions and I saw a bunch of
people requesting a updated what's in my
purse video so I figured why not sit
down and go through my purse because
it's kind of full it's kind of a
disaster but I have I guess some things
in there that maybe you guys want to
know about my last what's in my purse
video Conan O'Brien made a response
video to that I remember the day that he
responded I was getting so many tweets
like oh my god Conan O'Brien responded
to and I was like oh my god I was so
afraid to watch because I'm like he's
just gonna bash me he's gonna rip me
apart but it was actually really funny
so if you guys want to check it out I
will link it for you guys in the bottom
but today I have my Givenchy cursed it's
nice and full and I love this purse
because it holds so much stuff and it's
great for traveling whenever I travel I
always bring this purse with me because
it fits so much extra stuff and I just
have a problem when I go away I like to
bring so many things so having a big
purse like this always comes in handy I
got this purse for my birthday last year
I bought it for myself
and I'm obsessed with it I'm in love
with it and I use it all the time I
think if you guys are going to splurge
on a designer bag it makes sense to get
one that you're going to use all the
time so for instance a black color it's
something that I use almost every day so
I love this purse and I'm going to dig
through it for you guys I don't even
know what I got going on here but we
shall see so if you guys want to see
what I have in my purse please keep
watching quick side note I don't know
how to feel about this lip color I
wanted to do something different because
I feel like I only ever do nudes or
Pink's or just kind of neutral colors
because that's what I feel comfortable
in but I feel like so many people have
been saying I only wear the same makeup
look so I wanted to try a little
something bold before winter is
officially over so do you guys like this
lip color if not I apologize I know it
makes my lips look super big so
don't hate alright so the first thing
that I have my first ah is this little
foam case like look at this phone case
it's so soft and fluffy and fuzzy and I
can't get my gold phone case off of my
phone so I haven't put it on yet but I
actually just got this and I got it from
the mailbox and I just shoved it in my
purse but isn't it so cute it's still
fluffy and I feel like since I'm
allergic to every single animal and
known to man why not get a fluffy phone
case I don't think you'll be able to
take a picture though with it because
the whole is kind of covered by all the
fluff can you manage someone just pulls
out their phone now and goes hello oh hi
how are you what would you say that
person I'd go up and I did yeah alright
enough of that next I have two Mac
foundations that I actually need to
return the receipt I put this in there
because if I didn't put it in my purse I
would never go around to returning it I
got this at the mall the other day and
when I went into the Mac store I said I
need the Studio Fix foundations because
the ones I have the NC 20 and 25 and
they're a little bit too yellow my skin
has been extra pale lately so I wanted
to get the NW 15 and W 20 just so I can
mix them because I think together they'd
be like the perfect foundation for me
but I asked for the Studio Fix
foundation and they gave me the pro
longwear foundation so I just wanted to
swap those out so I do have the receipt
from Mac and then that um what did I get
from Mac I got two Pro Longwear
concealer I got them in the NW shades
because I only have them in the MC
they're more of like a cooler tone so I
wanted to try those I also got a new
mineralized skinfinish
it's called cheeky bran I tried it and
it's a little bit pink
so do is hear that
it's my friggin washing machine and it's
going to be so loud I hope you can hear
it do you hear that
that's my washing machine
hello trying to film here
I wonder if I made that I think it's
making that noise because I like shoved
in so many clothes polishing and put
that much in it so it's probably just
trying to whip around all that clothes
but hopefully it'll stop soon I need to
go turn it off
it literally sounded like there was an
elephant in my washing machine that was
just ridiculous
back to the big old purse okay the next
thing that I thought in there was my
little perfume that I bring with me
everywhere I've talked about these so
many times these are the impressions of
like the regular perfumes you can get
these at Walgreens these come in like a
little 3-pack I believe and I just love
keeping these in my purse because
they're so small I have a hair clip of
course you never know when you're need a
hair clip I also have a pair of
sunglasses
these ones are Ravens I actually just
got these the other day it was like oh
so I always keep a pair of sunglasses in
my purse um I have blue eyes obviously
but they say blue eyes are way more
sensitive to the sunlight and to
lighting so I always like to keep a pair
of sunglasses in my purse with me that
way whenever I'm out I can wear them so
that's I guess one of the main reasons
another reason is because sometimes or I
would say the majority of the time when
I leave my house to run errands or
whatever I usually don't have any makeup
on so just throw out a pair of
sunglasses and you're good to go so the
next thing that I have is a tampon box
with a spoon in it a spoon so I'm a bit
accumulated sisal in here some of you
guys would probably like why the hell do
you have a spoon inside of your tampon
box well I don't know how it got in the
tampon box but last weekend I had a
bridal shower and there was a couple
games that we played one of the games
was to check off everything that you had
in your purse and I was close to winning
so someone next was like oh my god a
spoon is one of them just threw a spoon
in my purse so I completely forgot to
take it out so I totally stole this
spoon from the restaurant that we were
at that's actually really gross but um
yeah so that's why that's in there um
tampons we don't even get into detail as
to why we need those but always have a
box handy usually I don't have a whole
box um with me but I was out and I
needed one so I bought a box but usually
I'll just shove one or two and
another thing that I have are these
clean well sanitizing wipes they're just
hand wipes I got these from Whole Foods
and I like to keep these in my purse
because sometimes when I'm driving I
just like think about the steering wheel
and I'm like oh the steering wheel is
probably so dirty so I always just have
these with me so I can just clean
anything whether it be my hands or the
steering wheel are just kind of anything
so I love having these with me they're
basically empty but I'm going to hold
foods after I film this video so I'm
going to probably pick up another pack I
have 2 packs of gum because clearly one
pack is not good enough um I usually
don't ever have gum like in my purse I
always wish I did I never do so I don't
even know when I bought this I like the
Orbitz sweet mint it's my absolute
favorite I also have Purell in my purse
I have Purell basically all over my
house and I have another one in the car
I'm just such a germ freak like it's
really bad I have like a problem but I
always use parallel I always make sure
my hands are clean and everything
running is clean so besides the sanitary
wipes I use this all the time as well
have a receipt from Kyoto Brookes gonna
kill me that it's still my purse because
we both keep our receipts in like a nice
folder so we can keep track of
everything and this was from Kyoto sushi
and steakhouse we went for dinner the
other night with his whole family for
his birthday so it's a little risky for
some reason I have a brand new nail file
in my purse I really could not tell you
when I put this in here or why off the
top of my head the only thing that I
could think of is maybe when we were
traveling to Tampa um I brought it to
fix my nails but I don't remember even
buying this so I don't even know where
this thing came from I got two hair ties
in the side pockets of my purse I
seriously always need a hair tie or a
clip so I just usually what I do it
wasn't like that I'll just clip the clip
into the hair ties like this and then
just put it in my purse that way if I
ever need either one there right there
you should I didn't even know these were
in here my
here attached to it my Chanel earrings
you should not be in there either
these are definitely because I wore them
in Tampa and when I was finished I just
put them in my purse because we were
traveling home so again I got to keep
this out so I can put that away two more
things through my things
um I have the agave lip mask I mentioned
this in my last video one of my
subscribers actually recommended this
for me and I'm so obsessed with it
because I have the driest lips in the
world and it's called agave lip mask
basically honey for your lips
and I've been obsessed with this lately
it really helps if you guys have extra
dry lips the next thing that I also had
in the side pocket was hand cream by
bliss and it's called high intensity
hand cream with macadamia oil grapeseed
extract oil plus a grape seed extract
sorry
FedEx was just here okay I always keep
this in my purse because I have very dry
hands because like I said earlier I'm
always either using Purell or I'm always
washing them because I'm a germ freak so
I need hand cream in my life because the
worst thing in life is when your hands
are dry and cracked and yeah so this I
always always keep with me another thing
that I have in my purse is this little
topicort spray um do you guys remember
that horrific burn that I had on my hand
look it's like basically gone like you
can't really you see it you could kind
of see like the outline of it and then
like my little biopsy mark but so what
originally happened I don't think I ever
updated you guys was when I burned my
hand um it got really infected so it
turned into an potato which is really
gross and which is something that
usually only toddlers get but of course
my burn turned into em Patito and then
it turned into psoriasis or what he
thought was diocese so he took a little
biopsy that day and gave me the spray so
when I started using this and it started
disappearing I was like huh
I got a phone call then a week later
saying that it actually came back as
eczema which is very strange and I've
never heard of Byrne having so many
different stages before it healed so I
don't really know what the hell it was
but this stuff has been magic for me
it's been clearing that out so I'm not
going to be using it much longer because
it's almost gone but that's another
thing I kept with me mostly because when
we were traveling I wanted to bring it
but also because sometimes I'll forget
to do things so if I have it with me my
purse I'll be good to go and my sweater
is attached my sweater is like can you
see how fuzzy all these fuzz's are
coming out look at this and the last
thing that I have is of course my wallet
that is just jam-packed with so much
stuff this walls from Kate Spade I
actually got it like 40% off I think
last year I love this color but um I got
some money in here got some receipts so
funny you know what I also have in this
little side pocket I don't know why this
is in here um this is like the little
smooth away I talked about this I think
in other videos I'll use it for like
right on my mustache and also sometimes
in between my brows if you just do
circular motions like three one way
through the other three back it'll
remove your hair so I've been using the
stuff forever they sell it at Walgreens
under the like I've seen on TV sections
eyes actually may not be there anymore I
think the last time I had to actually
order it from Amazon but I don't know
why this is in my wallet because I don't
need this on the go but um I just have
so many gift cards credit cards receipts
cash I had to check I need a cash more
receipts more gift cards just a whole
bunch of stuff in there and then some
change and then I have my little key for
my PA box and if you guys don't know
that I have a pedo box send me letters
because I love reading your letters
literally I cry every time I read them
it's so fun I always
like piles of them I'll sit up in my
room and I'll just go through every
single one and it's just so amazing
hearing from you guys seriously you guys
make my day and what I wanted to start
doing and I think I mentioned once in a
video is if you guys have the time and
you want to send me a letter or whatever
you want to send if you write your phone
number at the bottom what I really would
like to do is randomly call some of you
guys on camera wouldn't that be fun I
think that would be so cool and I don't
know so if you guys want to send me a
letter write your phone number and maybe
we'll make this happen we shall see but
there are a few people that actually
already sent in their letters with a few
numbers and I have them saved in a
separate box with like phone numbers
written on it so I can keep track of it
that way when I get enough I can just
randomly pick and then call you guys
would that be fun I think that'd be cool
that's really basically it for what's in
my purse I hope this video wasn't too
boring I just didn't want to do another
makeup tutorial today because it just
did one yesterday so I just figured I'd
do something a little bit different plus
I saw some of you guys requesting this I
am gonna try and film again Saturday I
can't guarantee it but I will try my
absolute best for you guys I really love
you all so much thank you for watching
thank you for being amazing and until
next time I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
