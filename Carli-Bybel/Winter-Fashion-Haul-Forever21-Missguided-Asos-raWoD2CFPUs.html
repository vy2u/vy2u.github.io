it has been snowing for the past 24
hours here in New Jersey and we didn't
get as much snow as predicted but it's
so crazy because it's just you look out
my window and everything is white it's
definitely our biggest snowstorm of the
year and I was laying on my couch all
morning with a cup of coffee my feet by
the fire and just kind of relaxing and I
was like oh let me just relax on the
snow day but then I reminded myself that
I work from home so just because there's
snow outside doesn't give me an excuse
to be lazy for another day so today I am
back with a fashion video for you guys I
wanted to show you guys some of my
recent purchases um let me know if you
guys like these types of videos and if
you want to see more of them because for
me sometimes if I buy something and by
the time I get it up on my blog and the
fashion post sometimes the stuff is
already sold out which is kind of
annoying so again comment below let me
know if you guys want to see more on
this and if you want to see some of my
recent purchases please keep watching so
here are some of my recent purchases I
would say from the past two months
pretty sure everything that I'm going to
be talking about today is still in stock
so that's a plus I'm going to start all
the way at this end this first sweater I
have is a beautiful pale blue sweater
this one is from H&amp;amp;M I picked this up I
would say maybe three weeks ago in store
I talked a little bit more about the
pastel trends for winter time back in
the fall it's definitely something new
that you're seeing a lot this year is a
lot of like nudes and neutrals and
pastels I've seen a bunch of pastel
sweaters online and in store I have I
believe a pale yellow one and then I
think a little bit more like a purple
color as well I think these sweaters are
so comfy and they're so cute
it would look adorable with just a pair
of jeans and a pair of boots or a pair
of flats they're lightweight so they're
not too heavy I know for me like the
thought of a turtleneck sweater is just
absolutely horrendous I could never ever
wear because I'd be sweating all over
the place even in this long-sleeve shirt
I'm getting really
ready so this I love because it's very
lightweight you can even wear like a
t-shirt under it or a tank under it and
you'll be good to go but I love this
color I love the pastels for wintertime
I mean normally we only see shirts
t-shirts or tank tops or stuff with no
sleeves with these colors so that was
one thing that I loved about the winner
this year the next outfit I have right
here is actually pajamas um this shirt
says I don't get boys but I get shoes I
thought it was so cute and it came with
these cute little matching shorts they
have little shoes all over them so I got
this in store about a week ago and
normally I don't buy pajamas I just
sleep in a t-shirt or sweatpants or kind
of whatever I have but I thought they
were so cute and I always get really
warm at night and I never have any
shorts to sleep in so I hope this was a
really cute set and it was only 12
dollars for the shirt and the shorts and
did I say this from forever 21 yet next
I have this baby blue jacket this is by
a brand called cameo they are a little
bit more on the pricey side but when I
saw this jacket in this color I
literally was like yes I need that in my
life this is from an online store called
the fashion bunker they only carry a
couple Australian brands and again
they're a little bit more pricey but
after a few weeks even maybe a month
everything goes on sale and they have
great sales so I love picking myself up
on sale this unfortunately didn't get on
sale but I just love how flowy it is I
wear this recently out into New York
City with in all black and white outfit
I wore black leather pants and a white
lace top and I thought it would be cool
to just add a pop of blue to it I'm
obsessed with the long coats for the
wintertime and I think any of you guys
in the market for a nice long coat why
not try a nice pastel color to bring in
the trend for winter the next shirt I
actually just got in the mail yesterday
it's just like a regular t-shirt but
with long sleeves I love the gray blue
color of this
this is just something really really
comfy and cute at the same time I would
pair this with a pair of blue jeans you
can even do black jeans with a pair of
boots if you're doing black jeans you
can even throw on like a leather jacket
I think it's just a really cute option
it's also very affordable which is
always great next I have this adorable
crop top bra top whatever you want to
call it I've been eyeing this for a few
months now and I finally went and
splurged on it it is a little bit more
pricey I got it from Free People but the
brand is for love and lemons I probably
will not be wearing this until spring or
summer time but if you guys wanted to
wear now I would maybe recommend wearing
this with a pair of high waist white
slack pants or trousers and you can even
throw on a jacket over it that way you
can wear it in the colder weather but if
you guys wanted to wear it in the spring
or summer time I think it'd be so cute
with a little light jacket pair of
highway shorts or even a skirt and yeah
it's just so cute I've had my eyes on it
for quite some time and decided to
splurge next up I have another coat I
actually wore this in my last fashion
video post where I did an all-white look
I absolutely loved this jacket I
actually got it in a camel color as well
which I'll show you guys in a second but
these are from misguided if I didn't
already say that I love them because
they keep you super super warm
especially on cold days like today and I
just think this cream coat is just
beautiful it's very classy looking and
you could really pair this with any
color if you want to do an all-white
look this will just kind of complete the
outfit but I actually love this jacket I
believe it was around 110 dollars but I
know it is still in stock um everything
that I'm showing you guys will be listed
on my blog with direct links and if it's
sold out I will try and find similar
options for you guys next I have this
new t-shirt this one is also from
forever 21 I got it in store I love
t-shirts like I live in t-shirts um I
have almost every color but I love this
new color I haven't seen one this color
yet but I'm loving the v-necks they go
great with jeans they go great to just
lounge in for pajamas really multi-use
but the best part
is that there are only six dollars and
ninety cents from forever21 so of course
I had to pick this one up so next I have
from misguided this beige trenchcoat
I've had my eyes on this for quite some
time but it was always sold out in my
size the best part about misguided is
they're constantly restocking items that
go sold out which is great because I
know some websites once it's sold out
that's it so I actually finally got it
in my size which I'm so excited about
I've been loving trench coats lately and
I just love this new color I'm planning
on doing a blog post Friday wearing this
so stay tuned for that so you guys can
see how I pair it but the best part
about these trench coats is you can just
wear it as a coat or you can wear it to
kind of finish off your outfit and as I
mentioned previously I also got that
cream-colored coat in this tan color I
love this color I'm obsessed with camel
this year and again I love these coats
just let you guys know in the two
misguided jackets the cream and the
camel I got a size zero in them for
jackets I always like to buy the
smallest size possible because I want it
to fit me as nicely as possible so it's
not so big and baggy next I have just a
simple little cami that I got from
forever 21 I think there were yeah there
were dollar 90 each and they had
literally every single color and I just
love camis not only to sleep in because
I'm basically sleep in camis all the
time but they're great for just under a
jacket under a blazer under a
see-through shirt but I would really you
need them for it's been quite some times
I've gotten any camis and they came in a
size extra small so that's what sold me
I love when they fit really really tight
I hate when they're baggy because then
it just kind of ruins the whole point of
them so since it did come in the extra
small I bought them in a few colors I
think I got this color like a nude color
and then I got a army green color which
I want to show you guys in a second
the next wow the next shirt is a cropped
turtleneck long-sleeve shirt I love
love turtlenecks this year like obsessed
like I think every time I see one in a
color that I don't have I go and buy it
I would definitely pair this with
something high-waisted whether it be a
skirt a pair of jeans a pair of trousers
or yeah I guess that's really all you
can really pair it with but I think
mixing neutral colors is so big this
year and you see it everywhere and I'm
just so in love with this little
turtleneck I also got this in a few
other colors that's my problem when I
love a certain style of something I want
it in a million colors because then when
I'm looking through my closet I don't
know what to wear I can kind of like oh
I wore this in a different color
recently and when I'm stuck and I don't
know what to do I'll just grab it
another color and then your step to go
the next shirt is actually a bodysuit it
is also premise guided I actually just
got most of the misguided stuff
yesterday that's why a lot of it is in
today's haul but again it's long sleeves
if it's nice and tight it's a crisscross
front and it's very low in the front so
you're gonna have a little cleavage
showing with this look but the one thing
that I always do if I have shirts like
this that maybe are a little bit too low
for my liking is I just use a little
safety pin and then a safety pin it just
as high up as I want the V to go so like
for this I'd probably safety pin it to
here so that way not too too much
cleavage is showing but again anything
long sleeve and tight fitting and
neutral colors is right up my alley this
year the next jacket I have is this
leather jacket it's like a nude light
pink it's by brand River Island but I
got it from ASOS and I literally just
got this maybe last week I love leather
jackets and I have a light blue leather
jacket and I think I have like a baby
pink leather jacket and then the rest
are just black so it's cool to add some
color and with the leather I would
recommend wearing this with I can
picture like a pair of light wash jeans
with one of many of these shirts let's
see what shirt maybe like the nude no I
just think any neutral colors would look
great with this you can even do an
all-black outfit with this or black
pants white top and this and I think
that would be really cute what I like to
do is if I'm mixing a bunch of colors if
I were to wear say an all-black outfit
with this I would have I would
definitely wear a clutch with the same
color to kind of bring out that pinkish
nude but I love this leather jacket
again I just got its own fleet still in
stock the next top is from forever 21 as
well it's just a knit long sleeve top in
this really pretty pale color you guys
can kind of see through all this it's
very a lot of neutrals this year a lot a
lot of neutrals and kind of just basics
like nothing too glitzy nothing too
sparkly which you know me you know I
love glitzy and sparkly but I don't know
it's just all about the solids this year
I'm seeing them everywhere I'm
personally loving them this is so comfy
you could throw this on with anything a
pair of jeans um
yeah basically just kind of anything
it's very very simple it's comfy it's
cute and it'll keep you nice and warm
because it's long sleeves just like the
other cami this one is also from forever
21 um a few of them had the v-neck
instead of the you neck so the original
one that I just showed you how the you
neck this one has a v-neck which I love
even better this one's also a size extra
small it's only a dollar ninety cents
you really can't beat that they're just
great for really anything so if you guys
are looking for good camis forever21 has
every single color and every single size
so that was great I love army green I'm
obsessed with this army green trench
coat that I have as well this one is
from ASOS I'm not gonna lie when I saw
Kim Kardashian she wore this along with
a green dress I was like oh my I love it
I went out and got it this bad boy needs
a little bit of a steaming before I wear
him but I love this and at first I was a
little worried with the long coats
because I'm so short but I think if you
style them right they really work for
anybody so if you guys
short and you're in the market for a
nice long jacket don't be afraid try
them out see how you like it because if
you thrown a little bit of a heel it's
gonna look really cute I promise I also
recently got from misguided this
beautiful poncho
it's the houndstooth print and I love
ponchos I've worn I've done a few blog
post wearing poncho so you guys can go
see how I've styled them in the past but
I just love how comfy they are they're
so versatile you can throw it on with a
belt or you can just leave it kind of
hanging and it looks gorgeous both ways
I would probably wear black high waist
pants just like a black plain
long-sleeve shirt or a turtleneck even
throw this on a pair of nice thigh high
boots and I think that'd be a really
really cute outfit for a night out or
for a daytime look if you want to just
throw on instead of the thigh highs
maybe just like a regular pair of like
low boots that'd be really cute as well
um I had a similar house to poncho that
I wore last year that everybody loved
but it was from Zara and it was sold out
at the time so I'm pretty sure this
one's still in stock and the last thing
I want to talk about today are these new
jeans they're by the brand reverse I'll
take them off the hanger so you can see
they are ripped jeans they are on sale
they were only like 30 bucks I believe I
got them from the website Dolls kill not
much percent positive but I will
double-check and again list them for you
guys but I just got them on sale they're
so cute I love ripped jeans like I'm
obsessed with ripped jeans boyfriend
jeans but I didn't have any black ripped
boyfriend jeans so when I saw these and
I saw they were on sale I was sold I
absolutely love these you can wear them
with a plain white tee pair of flats you
can wear them with a pair of boots pair
of simple heels the options are endless
when I got these I envisioned wearing
them was like a tight black cami or
something like that and maybe a jacket
over it but I just love these jeans I'm
going to link them for you guys
hopefully they're still in stock but I
love a good pair of ripped jeans and
they fit tight they're not baggy they're
not like the typical boyfriend jeans
they fit a little bit nicer which I like
because I think for a shorties out there
time's boyfriend jeans can make us look
even shorter so the ones that are a
little bit more snug fitting like these
are gonna help
maybe not cut you off as much so that is
it for now I hope you guys enjoyed this
