I'm not sure where you guys are from but
here in New Jersey it is so brutally
cold we skipped right there fall and
just jumped right into winter which I
guess really always happens but I don't
know I've just really I'm not prepared
for it
but the one thing that I always do is
take extra good care of my skin
head-to-toe when it's cold out and the
reason for that is my skin gets super
dry its irritated I just have never been
one of those lucky people that just have
nice skin throughout the year
so I'm going to walk you guys through
everything that I use for my face for my
body as well as my feet I'm gonna show
you guys a demonstration in a little bit
but my must-have products are a lot of
exfoliant for this time of year again
because we have the dry skin and it's
really good to help get it all that dry
skin off so for my face I'm loving the
Biore Pore unclogging scrub it has some
nice and moisturizing beads in it so
this is perfect if you like to exfoliate
your face at all time go to face lotion
which I've been using for like three
years now I probably went through like
ten bottles of these is the Nerium face
cream for my body I like to use this
exfoliator mitt as well as a nice scrub
this is a hand in body scrub once I get
out of the shower might go to lotion is
definitely the user in intensive repair
it's for a very dry skin and it's also
great if you have sensitive skin because
there's no fragrance in it so that's the
one that I always use this thing is
already almost empty and last but not
least I have my um opaque products these
are so amazing and they've been my Holy
Grail lately I think I've used it like
three or four times this month this
little device is going to help get rid
of all the dry skin off of your feet and
then what this lotion does is it really
locks in all the moisture so this
product you have to make sure you use
before you shower or before you get your
feet wet because it works the best on
dry feet or dried toes I'm gonna show
you guys a little demonstration in a
little bit so don't be weirded out by my
feet but this product is amazing
especially if you don't have the time to
go get a pedicure which seems to be my
case lately I just don't really have the
time to go out and treat my feet so it's
gonna really help smooth them up and
keep them nice and soft for the winter
and this lotion I actually love what I'd
like to do is I apply it afterwards and
then sometimes I'll even put a little
extra and then throw on my socks to
really let it soak overnight and when
you wake up your feet are gonna be so
soft you will be thanking me
so I'm going to show you guys some
demonstrations of how I do my
head-to-toe routine so if you guys want
to see please keep watching so the
sequence of this video is going to be
face first then we're going to do the
little foot action and then we're going
to move on to the shower and show you
how I do my body so I'm sure most of you
know how to wash your face I'll keep
this nice and simple but just make sure
before you're applying this exfoliator
that you removed all your makeup so that
way you can really deep clean get into
your pores and remove any dry skin I
like to Pat my face dry and if there's a
little bit of water left on your face
that is no problem I like to then apply
my Nerium face lotion this lotion is
super thick and it really locks in the
moisture making my face look super glowy
so now let's move on to feet this may be
a little bit weird so don't mind the
feet but I wanted to take you guys
through the step because it's super
important so here you can see a before
and after what my feet look like before
I use the product just very dry and
rough around the heel area so all you do
is you just switch on the mo bait device
and you just start applying it right on
your heels and wherever the skin is dry
make sure you do this on dry feet I
repeat dry feet because that is when it
works the best this moisturizer I'd love
to apply right after I've used this
device I also like to apply at nighttime
throw on a pair of socks and let it
really soak in and my skin on my feet
feel like a baby's bottom so it's
amazing so next moving on to body I use
my exfoliating mitt along with this
product which has amazing exfoliant in
it what I do then is I grab a little
scoop of that and I start doing circular
motions all over my body if you just
want to do your legs or just your arms
that's fine but I personally like my
whole body being really really soft so
that is what I'll do next and then once
you get right out of shower apply your
moisturizer you can dry yourself a
little bit with the towel but one little
tip that I recommend is leaving your
skin a little bit damp that way when you
apply the lotion is going to really lock
in all that water all that moisture and
it's going to make your
feels so so soft so I just wanted to
take you guys through all that another
thing that I love to do is I have a
humidifier I like to put it on at
nighttime when we're sleeping just to
really get some fresh air in the room
and me and Brett have been loving it
it's helped with our sinuses and
everything so it's been overall and
amazing a product as well so if you guys
are struggling with any of the above try
out some of these products let me know
how you love them because for me it's
made a world of difference I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I love you so
much and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
