in this tutorial I will be showing you
how I got this Wonder Woman inspired
makeup look the first thing that I'm
going to using is my wet and wild
fantasy makeup palette using the color
gold this is going to be going all over
my eyelid one of the reasons why I use
this as a base is because later on when
I apply glitter it will help it stay all
day long taking this dark blue color
from my Maybelline palette and my Mac
pencil brush I'm going to be applying
this right on the outer V of my eye
you're then going to drag the shadow
right along your crease line
taking a blending brush you're going to
blend in the blue shadow into your
crease then taking a brick red color by
Mac I'm going to be applying that right
above my crease blending it into the
dark blue color
then using carbon by Mac I'm going to be
applying this black color right again
over the blue in the V of my eye going
back to that same navy blue color I'm
going to be then using the blending
brush and applying the blue right over
all the cars I had done so far I'm then
lining my upper lashline with a Mac
liquid eyeliner
but I'm doing the inner part of my eye
I'm going to be dragging down the tail
pass where my eye goes just to make my
eyes appear longer
then using gold loose sparkles by NYX
and a shader brush I'm going to be
applying the gold glitter all over my
entire eyelid apply your mascara or
false lashes after you've done all of
these steps if you want to apply
rhinestones on one of your eyes like I
did I just use eyelash glue and
rhinestones that I got from Michael's
you can just apply the dots where you
want the rhinestones and then apply them
after that and they will stay all night
I had used them when I went out so they
did work you don't need to use any other
glue this glue is very safe for your
skin I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
and I hope it helps you out a lot thank
you for watching and please subscribe
