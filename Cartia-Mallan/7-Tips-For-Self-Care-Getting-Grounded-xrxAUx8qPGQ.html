well I'm cutting Milan and today doing a
super important video you guys have been
asking for something like this for the
longest time and I think I have very
good tips on this subject this all has
to do with getting grounded my tips for
self-care sometimes the world can just
be a lot to deal with we have to do
things as humans to take time out to get
grounded so that you can feel fresh
you can feel clean you can feel
productive you can feel like your best
self so this video is in collaboration
with Nivea they challenged me to give
you guys like top 10 the self-care tips
I think we've got about 10 I'm not sure
how many I've got we're gonna go through
them like I know of myself sometimes if
I'm really busy with work I might just
start feeling really uninspired or a bit
down or just a bit numb and I'm not sure
why or what's going on and so the best
things I can do when I feel that way is
I always come to these few things to
really care for myself and replenish
myself and get myself back on track and
they're just so important and I really
encourage you guys to practice stuff
like this or find your own little ritual
or routine for everyday life because it
is important to look after you you want
to feel good and you just have to feel
good so let's jump right into this so me
when my life starts to feel really
cluttered and my space is cluttered it
makes my mind and everything in my body
just feel like a total mess so the first
thing I always need to do before I go
into having a little grounding self-care
afternoon or day is I need to clean my
space you've got clutter and mess all
around your space it really does affect
your mental and physical and just
emotional space as well because if
there's clutter around you then you're
gonna have clutter in your mind so this
is what my mum always says to me she's
like clean space clean mind so so bad I
always leave clothes sitting on my bed
so I went through all of them folded
them put them away clean
my room made my bed I also just came out
to my living room area and just cleaned
up all the stuff on my desk this just
feels good because I work from my
apartment this is my workspace home
space
relax space so it has to be clean and
clutter-free it just helps it helps a
lot
meditation is just a way it really helps
me quiet in my mind to stop all the
chattering myself questioning myself and
just have a minute to reflect and pause
and be still there just a time to focus
on breathing and get oxygen into your
body and just it's powerful I can
honestly say edit ation gives me great
ideas it helps me just think clearly and
it literally will boost my mood I will
finish meditating I normally do it's
like 15 minutes
the minute I finish I just always like
will look out of my window and be like
everything's not so bad I'm on track I
feel fine I am fine and everything's
gonna be okay
it just calms you I highly recommend
meditation it is just really really
powerful normally once I've meditated
I've got some thoughts together
I will journal and journaling as well so
powerful completely change my life I've
been keeping journals for years now and
it's not only amazing to like look back
in your journal things that were going
on when you were like 15 or things you
were doing and this guy you really liked
or this crazy situation you thought was
like the end of the world and then you
read it back in your like way this
wasn't even an issue emily is a great
way it's like having a counselor you can
just talk you can say whatever you want
to say you can scream shout to your
journal you can draw things you can just
literally you can brain dump everything
going on your head and give it a space
and then be like okay that's shut that
stress is over and you've just let it
out it's just the best release and then
what I always love to do if I need to
get grounded again I will write myself a
weekly goals list that is achievable
easily you actually can get done and
have the capacity
to handle in that frame of time doesn't
matter whatever your goals are it could
be a big goal or a little goal anything
it counts and being able to put onto
paper and then being accountable for
that it's just amazing then you guys
know I'm super spiritual soil it's funny
it's actually a full moon tonight while
I'm filming this so I was writing a
manifestations list you can write a
manifestation list whenever you want
though the move doesn't have to be in
any certain phase a manifestation list
is your biggest goals and dreams things
you want to manifest or bring into your
life is right in the tone of I will get
done I will achieve done and I'm really
specific after writing in the language
of this is what I will get and you
because you have to believe it in
yourself you've got to believe those
goals and I find doing this grounds me
so much because it just pulls my focus
back into passions what are your
ambitions why are you doing this why are
you on this track and why should you not
give up now and then you're putting out
your intentions better you're gonna get
it back and then the final list I will
write as my gratitude list so things
that I'm grateful for this hands down
even if you don't do the other stuff
this list will always ground me it
really helps bring you back into reality
like wow these issues I have all these
feelings I have they're really unsure
it's just momentary compared to the
amazing abundance app in my life amazing
people I have in my life the amazing
opportunities the person I am sometimes
I write like what I'm proud of myself
for achieving all of these things are
just exercises to make your brain and
your body stop panicking and freaking
out and just be present and grateful for
what you do have because gratitude
counteracts stress this is what I always
say but it really does when you just
think about what you're grateful for you
kind of feel stupid for being stressed
about the little things then while I'm
here I'll also grab my diary so I'm so
old school I do not keep calendar dates
in my phone I need to write stuff down
and I draw a little tick box next to it
so then the next day when it comes to
doing that I can take it off and I feel
so accomplished I feel like I've
achieved stuff but it's just good at
keeps me on track I don't know what you
would call this skincare
yourself while looking after your skin
if I'm trying to be productive and get
worked on or just feel clean and clear
in my mind in inside my body and in my
life then I know my skin needs to feel
the same way so as I mentioned this
video is in collaboration with Nivea and
their three-in-one micellar water this
step is always so important in my
everyday routine for getting grounded
obviously you always remove makeup at
night
wash your face clean your skin but this
stuff really does help you get grounded
it's clearing everything on your face so
you can breathe and feel really super
fresh so what I always do
say I'm doing like an afternoon of
grounding or even just my day-to-day
tips for grounding and self-care I will
always always remove my makeup once I
get home so I got my Nivea 3 1 micellar
water this product is amazing because it
removes makeup it cleanses and it
moisturizes all in one so it makes my
skin feel absolutely incredible I'll put
some on a cotton pad and just remove all
of my makeup and love this product so
much because it just makes my skin feel
so fresh it removes my makeup so well
and it has no sting II feeling when you
go across your eyes it's very good for
sensitive skin you know how some makeup
removers they're really like so stinging
and ouch this stuff is like magic water
I swear it's incredible it doesn't only
remove my makeup it really cleanses my
pores deeply your feeling afterwards is
the best you don't have that sticky
slimy feeling of residue on your skin it
makes my skin feel really moisturized
and really soft and so fresh if you want
to feel like you can breathe again you
need to let your skin be able to breathe
to it and this product definitely helps
very well with that
my makeup is removed I love to do a face
mask this also just helps clear out
anything I'll always use like a drawing
mouth to put any key pollution that may
have put it on my skin from the day or
just anything like that this is my like
treat myself pamper myself women because
I think caring for your skin is so
important when I start breaking out of
my skin just feels really gross and dull
and yuck it just makes me feel even
worse so this step is so important I'll
cleanse face mask put some tone on
moisturize my skin
and then was so much better I think it's
really important as well what you're
telling yourself while you're doing
these simple steps when you're taking
off your makeup don't be being cruel to
yourself in the mirror like this is it's
so corny but what you tell yourself is
it's how you're gonna feel if you look
in the mirror while you remove your
makeup and you say well you are
beautiful you are worthy of everything
that you have I'm proud of you like talk
to yourself it's literally I'm so wet I
look in the room like I'm proud of you
girl like you're doing well you worked
hard today like give yourself a little
pep talk and compliment yourself on
something you love about yourself it's
so important the way you speak to
yourself pretty much sets a tone how
other people are going to talk to you
and that's the energy you put out there
boo so be kind to yourself another tip
for self-care is of course exercise
simply just going for a walk outside and
breathing in fresh air because you can
see everything is a lot about breasts so
getting grounded really just involves
things that help you flush out negative
energies or feelings you have in your
body so I think walking is also
extremely powerful moving your body gets
everything flowing your blood pumping
it'll give you a nice natural high so
I'll walk around my area I'll go do
bondi to bronte so summer element the
coastline because being by the ocean
also helps me feel really grounded
if you live near like a forest or a park
being in nature can really help agar is
amazing because it's all about breathing
and stretching your body out I would do
like an f40 five puffs like a
high-intensity like sweat session
depends how stress I'm feeling food food
is there to nourish you support you love
you guide you and make you feel better
when you're not feeling so good but you
cannot have used food
you have to be wary of what you're
putting in your body you're eating lot
to process food oily foods you're not
drinking enough water reflect on your
diet at that time if you're eating lots
of sugary foods to ground and center
your body again food is a healer so if I
start to feel really icky I will make
sure I'm eating lots of greens cooking
food from home because I know there's
like not heaps of added oils and then I
know I know the products I'm putting in
there I love making out big bowls of
veggies I love to put spices in it so I
love chili and tumeric and things that
are gonna kind of flush out any toxins
in my system
chili is great trying to get your
metabolism going fire up your body don't
like chili turmeric is an amazing
anti-inflammatory just healer of all
things if you're eating lots of greens
they're gonna really alkalize your body
nicely
I'm plant-based so if you're plant-based
as well and you're feeling ungrounded
are you actually getting enough greens
most importantly eating wholesome good
food you love to sit at my little table
forget my Sajak you don't know what
sages you've been living under a rock is
very amazing it cleanses it gets rid of
bad energy negative energy around you
also really good to sage your house if I
need to get grounded and make sure my
space is clear or a sage my body do a
big oh it smells incredible it makes me
just always feel so refreshed and good
and I'll always be thinking I had an
intention plate any negativity away from
me but that is everything from me to
that I hope this helps you guys in some
way I was really excited about this
collaboration with Nivea because I'm so
passionate about all these things and I
think it's really important to give you
