that I feel very passionate about so I'm
very excited to be speaking about
they're going to be talking about
consciousness so when I do these kind of
talking videos though it's like
intuition consciousness positivity the
level of whatever the kind of topic is
about the crux of it always has to do
with allowing you to live a more
positive happy life doing something you
love just interesting the things you
want to attract like it's all about just
living your best life so no matter what
type of topic it is they all come
together and help you get that I hope
that made sense I'm not sure because I
wish I could just make one whole entire
video saying and this is how to better
your life I could do look at a literal
like two hour long video if you guys
like that but there's so many different
sections to it there's so many different
tools that I use personally to do that
and they all kind of build on top of
each other and they all equally matter
so I think I'll split them up into look
small videos but I just thought step
starting with 22 you guys how to become
more conscious or how to tap back into
your consciousness would be a really
great size it just seems to be really
relevant right now so many people
messaging me about it I've had to help a
lot of friends through this right now
explain to us why being conscious and
why tapping into your consciousness is a
good thing when you are conscious and
you are aware of your surroundings aware
of how you feel aware of the people
around you it enables you to help
yourself more
whether that's positivity was up doing
projects whether that's with districting
the things you want like your
consciousness is like the ruler of that
it allows you to tap into your intuition
and love like this what I mean like the
list goes on it all connects to each
other but tapping into your
consciousness will help with everything
in life and it just helps you become
closer to yourself and that is so
important because as I always say my
videos I think self love and self worth
and being able to be by yourself is just
the greatest thing or yes let's just
I've ever oh my god
also how cute in point notebook is my my
notebook from Hawaii like I hate when I
go on airplanes I have a flat and
there's like lots of businessmen and
they all like without their laptop so
they're like really nice looking diaries
and I whip out there's like no chowder
all the other night I just sat down and
what really passionate about this I've
just been speaking to a friend about how
to tap into a consciousness more and how
to really start changing her life
because she had fallen into a bit of a
hole a bit of a rut which it was like I
just don't know how to move I can't I
can't see anything clearly I'm so fogged
and I was like okay okay there we go
chill take a breath
there are things we can do here we can I
just step by step by step so this is my
step by step by step on what I do and
the advice that I give my friends first
step listen really listen as simple as
that when someone sits in running and is
speaking to you whether it's absolute
 whether it's a really beautiful
story about their boyfriend story about
how bad that they was like and look
them in the eye and listen take
inspiration from that learn something
from that
analyze them through that get to know
humans more get to know the people in
your life more you don't have to put all
your energy into it and suck up any
negative stuff but just listen and be
there and be supportive but listen to
feel you know I feel like I learn best
when I talk to people I'm not a very
like textbook type of girl and I can't
really follow words well but when people
talk to me and they teach me something
through their words I can just that's
how I learn better through listening and
letting it affect me whether that makes
me angry sad happy like it all it's all
something it's all something to take
note of the second thing you should
listen for is listen to yourself listen
to your heart like really when you go
into a situation somewhere and you're
kind of conflicted or you're torn
between something or you want to do it
and you pursue a new job and your mind's
telling you look your mind's literally
just trying to stop you every way don't
ever look like it's just yapping away
and you're like oh my god I can't I
can't hear anything I can't figure out
what I want to do listen to your heart
what does it tell you sit with yourself
and just be like what what what is it
and this comes into into intuition but
I'm just talking about like generally
like listening to what your body tells
you if it reacts in a certain way like
take into consideration everything in
your body not just not just what your
mind tells you is everything and the
more you can really listen to where your
heart sends you or what it tells you it
wants I just
some people say like they're guys
they've got you know they've got in sink
their stomach stomach and heart whatever
like you feel something in here when
you're really effective and when the
right message comes back just I don't
know how many of an explainer is just
trust in there it's like really it takes
practice it takes focus sometimes to sit
and be like what is it
what is it telling me and even if off we
like to give me like a symbol give me a
sign like what is it and you'll be able
to slowly really feel when it sends you
in a certain way number two meditate and
breathe like we all sometimes just
forget to breathe even though way we
subconsciously breathe obviously every
day stay alive we're breathing but do we
ever just sit and allow our breath to
just like ah ma let it send to you you
really and this has to do a meditation -
meditation is a lot about the breath and
just focusing on your breath and being
still doing temes and meditation a day
just doing at least five minutes or
taking just a minute in the shower legs
to just put your head up and just do a
big breath let it go in through your
whole entire body your body just freezes
and it just has this moment of like time
almost stops and you're relaxed and
you're calm and in that moment your
folks Center in the present and that's
why you can kind of calm yourself more
and more information kind of comes to
you I feel like when you're in that
state of being I'm obviously not going
to that's a lot about meditation that's
another side track if you know about
meditation I really highly recommend do
it every day just write it down set an
alarm on your phone and just 10 to 15
minutes like you just don't even know
how much it really helps but the more
you keep doing it you're like well I'm
becoming like a Jedi like okay I feel
like I'm transcending we're all you're
going to feel very calm those reactive
what it is stressed and then it's the
nicest thing to know that if you do
start feeling reactive or stressed or
angry or anxious you can just take
yourself aside for like 10 to 15 minutes
20 minutes 30 minutes and just sit and
meditate and I promise you'll feel
better after that I also just wrote
under this about breath allow the
stillness of your breath to cleanse
negative thoughts and fear nothing can
hurt you or stop you on this path
besides yourself so I always remind
myself that when I'm stressed or if I
start feeling anxious when I sit and
meditate I just remind myself that there
was nothing hurting me and that the only
person that is allowing myself to feel
this way of my is me and the only person
that can stop me from achieving
something that I really want is myself
too so yeah that's a very centering sort
of because it comes back to you
varrick's point is health guys look
after yourself
eat good food and please move your body
you don't even know how helpful moving
your body is like I know that exercise
can be daunting and knowing
and just like it's like best some days I
wake up and I'm like no I just think I
don't want to go sweat today I'm going
to put it in this this way think about
it every day we eat food we're
constantly putting stuff into into our
body sometimes selves we don't know what
the freakin ingredients are we don't
know what preservatives and spray no no
we don't even know what we're really
putting our body half the time let's be
real like there's so much face kind of
food you know your body is doing so much
for you all the time
it's constantly on and even when you
sleep it's doing you know like it's
just taken away so give your body a bit
of a rejuvenation and a little present
back to say thank you by moving it
it needs a way to clear out all the
excess crust that it doesn't need in
there anymore otherwise it's going to
get stuck in there and just like stale
energy that you might hold in your
energy field in your mind it's just like
if you've got to suck in your stomach
somewhere in your arms or live somewhere
like it needs a release through
exercising whether that's yoga I just
sometimes I just walk like I love just
walking like 30 minutes and I'm like I'm
cleanse I'm pure exercise gives you like
a natural high and over time it just
keeps building and building the
serotonin levels in your body feel like
when you exercise sometimes your body
also goes on to order flight mode so
you're kind of meditating at the same
time as you exercise it cleanses your
mind well it comes your body and it's
just moving it was just so so good I
just recently started doing yoga and for
about six five months now I would wake
up and be like cardio you should really
sign up for yoga you should look up
where we go to you in Sydney is maybe
like yeah yeah like I'll do it later but
I had this recurring message in my mind
like do yoga and as much as it which
like fried the out of me because
I've been to yoga shoes before
everyone's very like a yogi like it's
over and I hate that I'm like so I get
so shy and I'm like uh-huh and I I don't
I don't know how to do guys I like I
only just
dotted but my friend Lola was like hey
let's go do yoga like let's go to a hot
yoga session I have a great studio I
think you'll love it so I feel asleep
like yes you do this so I went with her
one night and we did an hour of hot yoga
I it was like a tricky kind of class
like it was like you know not for
beginners it was fast pace so it was
moves in there that I was I had no idea
I just threw myself into it and found
this new love
I'm literally addicted I can tell you
guys I signed up for like the unlimited
one month pause before I go back to LA
and like I've been every single day
since and when I leave club I know that
my mind and my body gets clipper says
like thank you for that car you're like
good and I feel good from it and I feel
lighter and I feel more efficient with
my time
next point number one two three four a
very important point reflection this may
differ per person you know everyone
reflects in a different way whether
that's verbally reflecting speaking to
someone telling someone how you feel or
just having a conversation about
something journaling that's my preferred
way of reflection I love generally I
swear by journaling I feel like when you
put a pen to paper you let your mind
drift and your hand just goes something
else speaks I don't know like sounds
like voodoo like huh who's talking
gardial I guess the random person just
entered my body but like I'm not even
freaking kidding you like when you just
let it go and you just lit onto a piece
of paper I feel like I solve every issue
that I have going on in my mind in that
one sitting of like journaling and also
- such a nice way to document things
when you look back at it if there's
something so beautiful and when it's
written in word it's just so powerful no
right way to do it everyone oil sesame
Academy general which I say what's an
example I'm like here let me just
release my journals online you guys go
see all what's going on the gear is a
control like you could do anything like
art is a way of reflection creating
films the way poetry I love writing
poetry when I'm feeling
dramatic like in a less dramatic side
girl and I just write out all my
feelings in for some weird reason when
you we express through words a feeling
that someone else can relate to it just
makes you feel confident and like it's
just the best and they know how to
explain it
and I wrote below that write journal
create art as an outlet for your emotion
and feelings honor your feelings and
then let them move on so it's so
important I think journaling helps or
art or just reflection in general helps
you go okay
bit this happened and this is how it
made me feel this is how I want to
progress from this moment and now I'm
going to let it go and then you get to
progress in your life and this is where
people get stuck is because they're
holding on to old feelings old emotions
old memories of just something you just
don't need to is crowding the space in
here so instead remove it put it into
your journal and then you've still got
it you're not removing it forever like
saving you on the hard drive you know
0.55 a long time we're going to a long
time spend time alone actually I don't
know what a lot of people I speak to
actually really love a long time it's
like for me it was just really a hard
thing to try and be good at but I'll
read out what I wrote first and then
planet bubbles like my main claim has to
find comfort in your presence after all
this is your vessel for life find joy
with himself and with your in solitude
helps you to tap into your highest self
that hovers above you and it really
helps to open your consciousness my
biggest struggle I always feel is after
I go traveling or after I've been with
the bigger people or with someone for
like a week or two weeks straight or
I've been partying a lot and then I come
home and I'm literally just working and
I'm alone I will get home and I'll
suddenly sick and so lonely I exhausted
like my life is just a mess I need to I
need to move I need someone around me
like oh my god like I have no friends
like I know I have nothing in my life
like all my
and I literally start going into turmoil
in my mind because I start to go on with
the order panic button instead of just
sitting with myself and saying like wait
a minute
tap back in tap back in so my best tip
is if you you're like me and you feel
like that the more time you practice
being alone the easier it gets and the
benefits of spending time alone is just
that you can really hear yourself speak
you can hear you I always refer to my
consciousness not being anywhere in my
body I recited my consciousness being
right above me like this my
consciousness is all around my bodies in
this space
I don't know how what level of
spirituality you are on is still you
don't have to believe in what I'm saying
this is my own made-up thing it's what I
personally feel in my body but you can
link this without whatever you feel like
your consciousness is maybe your
consciousness is in your chest maybe
it's in your legs or your arms your eyes
it can be anywhere for you I don't know
but when you're alone you can hear what
your consciousness is telling you better
and you can also just I don't know have
more fun with yourself you realize that
like this body I'm in this person that
is sitting in this room this is me and
I'm saying I always say like web-one
alone we die alone
so you manzil get to know yourself two
years I didn't get to know myself I had
no idea who I was I never spoke to
myself I never listened to myself all I
did was interact with other people and
was kind of just and we just caught it
was just there
I had fun and I don't you know whatever
I wasn't like I was so happy but I
didn't really ever tap in if my just
crazy like being alone helps me to tap
in check out be like what do I need do I
need to eat some broccoli like do I need
a banana do I need some water
do I need to go to the beach what do I
need right now do I need to go read a
book do I need to have a ball should I
call my mom to 10:00 p.m. examples but
it just helps I don't know and it just
makes you more independent and it helps
you grow and
and can you just learn point six this
one might not be for everyone it depends
on what level of spirituality or what
level your consciousness is currently on
and how much sense this might make you
this might make no sense to some people
I might sound really crazy after this
video but I'm just going to say this
anyways because if you're on this level
you might get and it's not about it you
know on this level you're understand
it's not that old if people will be
affected by everything I say definitely
been just this is just something I think
is helpful to becoming more conscious
and that is believe in magic it's only
the hardest thing on this list it is a
really hard thing to do because we have
been born into a world where society
tells us that everything is mathematical
and calculated and planned and learned
observers but the more you actually open
your consciousness and you start to see
signs and things and synchronicities
you'll actually see that magic is real
and manifestation creates magic Law of
Attraction you can make magic happen in
your life like everything is so magical
my right nut associations when I just
put something out there that I want like
my god I wish I could make a video about
all the stuff that's happened to me that
I have said like it's like really
personal stuff that I'm just like you
guys don't like I'm not going to babble
on about like well this magical stuff
has happened to me but I put my life
down to literally magic and just having
faith in and having belief that there is
something bigger than me that is helping
me out and that if I put the right
energy are they gonna foster it hit me
get someone whoever I don't know if it's
a god or it's a it's a higher presence
or just its energy field they hear you
they see you and if you have faith in
them and when I say them personally to
me I save them referring to the universe
and say them referring to energy but I
also really do believe in angels I
really believe that there's spirits
around us I've had so many experiences
with science from angels I feel so many
signals around me when I just have faith
that there is more to life than just
humans and if there's more to life than
just what you know black and white and
what we see in front of us there's a
really mystical realm and it's not like
it's not something you have to believe
and I just feel like it's not only
really hire me to talk about the meaning
open and honest with you guys and
telling you like what I believe in um I
think it can help a lot of people and it
also just is really cool stuff I've
honestly experienced some crazy to
do with all of this and it's still
shocking to me and I still I'm like how
is this self real but personally I've
experienced it like I've had my own
career and also whether you're religious
when you believe in God and you you know
you're Catholic or your whatever you're
Buddhist or using any religion as well
like all the stuff applies like religion
and spirituality is not that far from
each other it's just we all believe in
like a higher power and a presence and
so there's no exclusion here you know
it's everyone's own personal beliefs is
so fun and so welcomed and that's so
cool to have your own belief or maybe
you don't believe in anything at all and
you're just like not we just hear it
like that's fine to make what you can
take from any of this any of this advice
and just be like I'll take that I'll
take that and like because this is the
thing that like people have wars over
that they just can't accept that some
people are different
to each other we're not all supposed to
be the same like I'll be so boring
it will also be stupid there'd be no
point to life we're all so unique and
brave individual things you have which
you'll find when you open your
consciousness more the seventh is on
that I personally struggle with the most
and that is patience patience for me is
my biggest challenge and I'm always
constantly thrown tests from the
universe to really test my patience of
how much the cardia want this is she
going to wait it out or is she going to
try and cheat the system
I also under patients I wrote plus
practice doing all these things revolves
practice I have patients in this bit
your consciousness will slowly open and
through this your happiness will slowly
come and then
happiness slowly coming Dizzy's eyes
that you really hope from the life you
really want to live will come but it
requires patience and then I just wrote
these skills form over time there is no
rush everything happens exactly when it
should and you just have to believe in
that any time I start freaking out or I
call my friends line this wasn't so bad
I don't know what to do when I thought
blustering like this they're always just
like Katya patient it's gonna happen you
have to believe in there that it's going
to have to put a wrap this up with my
last point and I'm not going to expand
on the last plant I'm just going to
leave it at that because it's something
I'll speak about in another video
sometimes but the last thing I just
wrote before I ended it with be fueled
by passion and love because they are
some of the most powerful things I
believe that we have within us and you
can never go wrong when you're fueled by
those two things so I have I have no
idea what I've just said I just had a
feeling that I needed to speak about
this um I'm super passionate about all
this stuff this is what I do in my life
and it doesn't you don't have to do any
on this is just my tips tools and wacky
tricks I hope it might have helped some
of you a little bit though um or giving
you some insight
it just doesn't into a little bit more
about me and yeah also my happiness
comes from a lot of that has helped me
really get to such a point where I can
lift my mood really easily thank you
guys so much for watching it really
means a lot to me if you watch it all
the way to the end leave any comments
below what you thought or your tips to
becoming more conscious
there's also many more there's just the
first two I thought of they'll be more
