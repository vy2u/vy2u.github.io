wake up and you some 40
all dressed and ready today I'm gonna be
filming and little a day in my life
video is easy just come up from
Wollongong for the day and we're just
gonna go and get some breakfast come
hang out I've got to come back and do
some work later on and then hopefully
we'll get to the beach but it is so cold
today it's it's like the sunniest day
it's really beautiful but it's so windy
and freezing so we're gonna grab some
breakfast and yeah just kind of hang out
and I thought I just filmed this for you
guys and see what I do on my weekends my
weekends are always different
something's always going on so this is
kind of what I would normally get out to
so let's go in Sydney today
really frigid freak we are just walking
to this being cafe and it's really cute
if you're gonna say it's like a little
fairy got it
back to back with a brand new cell look
at how we've entered how your boy gets
down ela round four round and a pound
for pound got two feet on the solid
ground had a reggae view to let happen
to you had a messed up life : Pepe LePew
when funny to shoes when he's one in the
blue you see ya settle for signs who's
droppin dead - how was breakfast he such
a cute little cafe it was really
freezing I just have to get some work
done out if he's gonna go and get a
haircut spontaneous haircut a decision
is pretty bad getting long and I
need some work done
what can cost you on a Saturday let's do
it even though it's a Saturday this is
usually what happens like a normal day
my life always involves some sort of
work I feel like you know most people
whose job is like Monday to Friday you
have set times this job is like you
pretty much set your time but I always
have work to do every day today I have a
lot of editing to get done some videos
sent up and I'm also working on
something really exciting that you guys
are gonna find out very soon that I'm
creating that I needed to follow up on
some stuff so I'm gonna get changed as
some warm comfy clothes key and take off
my makeup because I don't like sitting
around like I go out and I come home and
I just have to Ed I'll always take off
my makeup because I hate just there's no
point at me it's just sitting around my
makeup on let's get it
so much warmer much better wrapping my
Cubs forward jump I am obsessed with
Cubs 100 K so honestly if I'm at home
getting work done I cannot send my
makeup you guys always like how do you
keep your skin tone clear all the time
it's because I don't wear makeup and I
don't need to because it just feels like
it clogs my pores really badly my tips
for being productive as well when it
comes to working from home editing
trying to get stuff done I need to feel
fresh like I'll always sit down I
probably try and meditate Scala Hebrew
whatever pray and it and I always take
off my makeup so I'm just going in with
some little cotton pads and going on my
favorite favorite makeup remover it is
the if you have sensitive and caring and
micellar water I love this stuff it
removes my makeup so solo I says take it
and put someone to come back where's my
house in fine it's on table my makeup is
because it's in time always wearing it
and I shoot with it for work and stuff I
just think it's to keep your skin really
healthy and clean and clear it's
important maybe I'm moving is important
I love this new me a makeup remover as
well because also really hydrates my
skin it doesn't leave my skin feeling
dry or yucky or oily doesn't leave that
gross kind of like oily residue that
some make her movies and they leave
after you remove it when you touch your
skin it's like oh what is this oil lay
out on my face if I don't use the
micellar water in this form they also
have the best makeup removing wipes that
I love using when I've got my big winged
eyeliner on because it just takes it off
perfectly
this also really cleanses your face
while you do it it boy stur Isis so if I
don't have time to actually cleanse
after I don't feel like it's gonna clog
my skin because it's so light this thing
removing your makeup is important so you
can let your skin brave and like feeling
like your natural self what I've been
loving since I've been home from America
is just I don't have hair extensions and
right now I don't have eyelash extension
there right now and I'm just really
embracing how I look naturally and my
skin and I just I'm really actually
preparing myself without makeup on a lot
more at the moment which is I think a
great thing
one that I guess sometimes I get really
nervous without makeup on and times if I
flake my skin's not good but yeah so I'm
loving this I think it's really
important and I think it's really great
also just I don't know with this my
Silla where I'm like how is this even
possible
all other makeup removers I used
whenever I go over my eyes um like I
makeup it's crazy to me that this
doesn't sting your eyes at all like and
like look it just removes mascara so
effortlessly I think finding little
simple routines that you can incorporate
into everyday life like makeup removing
meditation exercise whatever it is it
makes you feel comfortable in your own
skin and really fresh kinda lets you
breathe again is really important for
productivity at least I know for myself
having these little routines in place
helped me keep my mind clear my work on
track and all of that
okay now that all my makeup is off I
just my skin feels so much better and
honestly this product micellar water is
the best because I feel like you know
that fresh feeling you have after you've
just cleanse your face and you feel like
really really clean it does that well
moisturizing and they're just I wish you
guys could touch my skin for the camera
it's so just feel so silky and smooth
and nice so much more energized and
better now
so yeah I think I'm ready to just
knuckle down as much as I wish I was
outside for liking about I have work to
get done so I'm just gonna sit down now
get some editing done and just to drink
some tea smash it out I always feel so
good once I've been productive and then
we'll just see what else where else the
day takes me
I finally finished most of the work that
I had to get done I sought to sting
after a while when I'm looking at the
laptop it's like ages easy it's just
gotten back from a haircut so I'm not
sure what we're gonna do it's like still
really just horrible weather outside
it's freezing
Tamara might just watch a movie we've
just made some lunch a big bowl of
veggies and avocado and these like
veggie putty things and we're just about
I look a bit crazy yeah we're just about
to watch an episode of not close before
we go down to bond I'd the Sun is slowly
coming back out and it's forecast to
come out for later this afternoon so we
wanted to go to the beach so we're
definitely gonna go for sunset and go
get some food go down I mean I would
Ricardo down there and hang out so we're
just chilling the finale it's actually
really good we just had a nice chill day
yes thank good so yeah we're gonna watch
knockos I'm excited by okay okay easy
and I've just gotten ready I'm going
with leopard prey we're gonna dance and
the pain and the Jones and is he's
looking rough in wearing old Cardy
Malone except for Tiger shoes okay I'm a
little bit we're going down to Bondi so
I'll just call the uber and we're gonna
go down and the Sun came out we were
right okay let's go bye
I love this design
okay so we've just gotten home oh so
happy we didn't have a really late night
out we just went to a few different we
like had snacks out like Bondi fish as
the Sun was setting and then we went to
this new place haven't been to was it
called muslin bond I just hit the beach
road Beach Road hotel and that was
really nice and was just so good because
okay easy Ricardo a night we all went to
school together in Brisbane and easy
lives like an hour from Sydney Ricardo
live is pretty close to me and we've but
we don't often get to all catch up
together so now we just had really great
chats it's a new moon last night we're
just talking about stuff we want to put
forward for the next few months coming
our intentions and our goal really the
next two weeks yeah said two weeks will
rekindle have the same chart mmm-hmm
see what we've done like we spoke about
our goals we learn from the next two
weeks I'm gonna come back together in
two weeks and see what we've like worked
on and it's just good I think I wanted
to say like what we also spoke about
tonight was like how important it is to
have people around you that encourage
you and push you to do things that you
really want to do and that hold you
accountable to the things you want to do
and support you and don't judge you for
like your goals your goals and I think
that's why we all work so well together
and we achieve stuff here because we
just back each other I think it's one
thing like being able to recognize your
own goals and being able to write them
down yourself and say them to yourself
but that's one thing and then it's also
another thing to be able to express that
it should be like a rate hike to it ever
so hard to say that and say that without
yeah having judgment involved but yeah
so I think it's just great and I think
we're all happy with that we've you know
being able to do that because we have
come so fast since school and we all
said in school we want to live in Sydney
you want to do the staff an hour at this
point we're like okay we've done these
things but we've also led a lot of our
passions kind of slip and there's little
things in all of our lives that now will
I
okay no we're gonna take action and just
start doing it and hold each other
accountable for that and so yeah yeah
anything else
I just think no it was just a really
good it was really good to just rekindle
and chat and be real be real with each
other real also speak about things like
you know I know for a fact I openly
spoke tonight about insecurities I have
that I want to over comment it's not
just goals you have that are unlike the
outer surface but its goals you have
internally that you want to work on
because you're not going to achieve
those big goals until you work on yeah
that's tough first time to focus on
creating a balance and recognizing the
balance that you need yeah I've and the
balance between fun and one and hand big
thing and I think we'll we handle the
terms of like balance is when you're
having fun
where you're working hard but you're
also allowing yourself to have fun
because we know within ask that when
we're having fun and enjoying life
that's when we get our best creative
ideas so it's harnessing that and
literally like the best your best
content like the best things come from
when you're enjoying yourself and
enjoying life and for what it is not
putting us in every moment and and
pressurizing things like just let it be
like and let's yeah a lot of how they
need to I think it's really easy to get
stressed out about not achieving
something in a certain time but then
yeah when you give it time to brew and
let it happen in its own always say
divine timing then when it comes to
fruition you're like oh my god it make
sense as to why that issue came about
all that thing I'll talk about this in a
full video so and I think it's important
I actually like address this because I
think it's something we all struggle
with especially when you're like a
determined yeah person feel like
everyone struggles with it it's just
like some people can actually pinpoint
it and vocalize it some people recognize
it just don't talk about Russia yes I've
read so yeah it's been a good day
excited for the next few weeks to come
like I know
I've got a lot of work to get done so
does Izzy's freaking moving to like
London really soon moving across the
country so everyone's kind of got their
stuff going on but I think it's good to
focus on yourselves and then have people
I knew you trust to be able to speak
openly whether it's your mom a friend
yeah whatever yeah anyways we'll talk
more about this later we can do we can
do a full video in this certain half so
