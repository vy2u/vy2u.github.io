been a while today we're doing a video
that I think is really important for me
speaking about some stuff that's good to
get off my chest I think this can also
help a lot of people just by me speaking
about my own experiences and also this
is a video out of respect to kind of
inform you guys and actually let you in
on what's going on in my life right now
and what has been going on because I've
been like yeah I've been posting and
I've been uploading but I've kind of
looked what's going on up here away and
I've been pretty radio silent I'm just a
normal person and I needed to do exactly
what I've done over the past few months
and I'm gonna talk to you guys about it
I mean let you know what's been going on
finally this this video is long overdue
didn't expect it to take me this long to
sit down and film this but then again
something I've learnt over the past few
months is timing is one of the hardest
things to figure out I like some things
in my life happen like that and then
some things take a really long time to
come to fruition but all I know and all
I can confidently say is that I truly
believe in the power of divine and
timing I always talk about divine timing
everything happens exactly when it needs
to and sometimes in the moment it's hard
to recognize that and realize that until
later when it all unfolds you know like
that's why I really believe you meet
people in divine timing you have hires
you have lows all in divine timing
everything that goes on is perfect in
its own way and I'm just learning to
trust the process that I'm on pretty
much I got asked a few questions on
Twitter and it really got me thinking
and it more or less was kind of a
reminder to me to be like cut it sit
down and do the video even though I've
never planned this video I don't really
know what I'm about to talk about I just
know that you you guys want answers and
I know that I want to speak about my own
human condition over the past few months
and just what I've been thinking about
what I've been feeling what I've been
experiencing
because there's a lot that goes unsaid
there's a lot that you guys don't see
you know there's I post about this much
of my life actually I post quite a lot
of my life and I always try and vocalize
a lot of my life and the highs and lows
to help you but over the past few months
I've been extremely private but someone
pretty much just said talk about people
claiming that you have changed in a bad
way and what's next for Katya Milan
someone else said a life update aren't
girls motivations and future plans
another person said we just want a life
update how do you feel with yourself at
the moment amazing you guys are just so
 switched on I love those
questions and it's exactly what I'm
gonna talk about today is pretty much
all those things I have some notes and
I'm just gonna start babbling as I do
ever since I moved to Sydney I have been
learning a lot about myself I mean you
guys experience my journey and Byram
with me and I learned a lot about myself
there I was living in byron when I was a
17/18 and I was going through my
youthful rebellious phase that I had not
much structure in my life I was just
doing whatever the hell I wanted to do
pretty much I lived off every single
paycheck that I got and I would go from
having a bit of money to no money a bit
of money to no money and then I was like
hey I need to get my life together I
mean I moved to Sydney and start taking
my career more seriously and start
chasing down the passions that my
creative pursuits that I wanted to
achieve and so I came to Sydney which is
still pinch me kind of crazy it was it's
been always been a big goal for me to do
and to be able to do it alone and have
my own two bedroom apartment like at the
age of 19 is still really surreal to me
and I'm so grateful that I get to that I
can do this
and then also somehow I got myself here
like when I got to Sydney it was really
a big wake-up call of the world of being
an adult like I had to come to terms
with hey you've actually got to have
more of a structure you you need to pay
bills rent here is so expensive so I
needed I need a work mind to work harder
to make more money to survive my
lifestyle so
becoming expensive and I guess for me
being creative and also loving to
traveling most of my inspiration comes
from experiencing things I output more
than half of my income on furthering my
own personal growth and also put up a
lot of money to try and support other
people around me so yeah
story short when I moved to Sydney my
adult hat came on and I started to stop
doing things that I love to anxiety
around needing to get enough money to
just survive was my focus I started yet
to stop doing things that I loved and
putting yet work first which is amazing
and I was really proud of myself for
doing that but in that time I lost this
little part of me that little spark that
was my rebellious spot where spontaneous
spark I just started to become very a
homebody I didn't go out as much I
didn't go and go to gigs and in
experience as much as I wanted to and I
would pretty much just work work work
like work in Sydney and then I would go
overseas and it was kind of like I was
running away not even running away I was
just trying to find that spark again I
didn't make creative films for a while
you guys all saw that and I was because
I just had nothing to create there was
nothing new going on I like for the past
few months I've been downloading
information and trying to just learn
more about myself and understand what it
is I really want to do I'm trying to
find my purpose you know and to do that
I just I knew within myself there is had
to ride the wave started to really freak
out as my numbers kept going up I was
like what is this world I'm stepping
into it because I saw when I went to LA
some of the people that were at the top
and you think that they've got it all
they've got the money they've got the
fame they've got just what seems to be
like a perfect little life and everyone
says this but it's just not what it's
not as it seems and most of them are
just searching for love because they're
lacking they're lacking the right people
around them they're lacking that love
for themselves whenever I came back from
America this one time that I real
I was like all I care about is the
people around me in my life my family
and my friends and like supporting them
and helping them get to a place that we
can all do this stuff together a lot of
my time over the past few months has
well at least my energetic time and the
energy my energy outputs have been going
towards really helping and not helping
but just trying to be there for my
friends and most of my friends like my
best best friends live in America so
they out put so much energy to me as
well so we all just kind of I don't know
my hands hands it's so hard to explain
because I'm still trying to figure it
out like I just feel like over the past
few months I've been giving away a lot
of my energy to other people and that's
just the type of person I am
I would rather help people than receive
I get my kicks of helping people that
makes me feel good it makes me feel
whole it makes me feel grounded and
balanced and sane I just knew that I
needed to every time I had an impulse to
go to LA Oh every time I had an impulse
to go somewhere or do something I knew I
just had to trust myself and do it even
though I would ruin half of the jobs
that I was doing at the time sponsorship
stuff which is my income which a lot of
you guys know obviously right now that's
how youtubers make money I couldn't
really pinpoint a message I wanted to be
getting across to people sit down to
edit something and creative wise I was
like I've lost that spark I just can't
find how I used to do this and then I've
kind of started to realize well it's
because you've just stopped living
fearlessly and spontaneously I started
to realize I had been conditioned into
being this social figure just like
everyone else like I found myself
dressing differently
I found myself telling myself down a lot
judging myself on these little things
that were really quirky about me that I
used to love before and I'd love showing
them off and just stop doing them and I
was like whoa okay this is why you don't
feel right you feel like everyone else
you just you feel like you don't stand
out
anymore you don't Sparkle anymore and
that to me is like my worst fear because
I am African extra as leo I love to
make a point of difference just so
that's my way of showing Who I am when I
can't say it to someone or not what if
someone can't just come up and speak to
me like I need to be able to express
myself that's how I stay saying is being
able to express and create it was just a
word moment right now I'm pretty much on
just a mission to find balance in my
life I can't be Byron Katya any more you
know when people say I miss Katya when
she lived in Byron and she used to do
this business my life is completely
different now I don't live there I I
don't have that much freedom I do have I
have all the freedom in the world but I
have responsibilities now and I have
other things I actually want to be
focusing on that require more of a
routine like I'm at a different place in
my life and I love Byron Katya - she was
young and rebellious and ruthless and
reckless and she was finding herself and
then Katya now is the exact same I am
still ruthless rebellious a completely
unsure but totally sure of myself and
I'm still finding myself like I truly
believe that you just you'd never stop
finding yourself you're always on a
journey and you never stopped changing
and growing I also find that to really
truly find yourself you have to
completely lose yourself I found myself
a few times in my lifetime already I'm
only 19 I'm gonna continue to find
myself as I keep changing and then I
catch myself on oh here's the changes
you've made here's who you are in this
moment right now and understanding that
this is who you are right now but you're
gonna continue to evolve and grow and
change and that's okay and I think
what's scary about losing yourself or at
least for me like it makes me so
emotional talking about this because
it's something that you don't get taught
like no one tells you that one day
you'll be feeling like incredible and so
sure of who you are in the path you're
on and then the next day you'll wake up
and you'll just feel a bit like lost and
conflicted and unsure and lone
and uneasy and I went through that I've
been through that for so many months
I always knew who I was and what I
wanted but I knew I had to go through
those feelings to unravel more greatness
within myself and being a while it's
been a super long journey doing that and
it's totally normal we all go through
this we all feel these feelings and only
thing I'm sorry for is that I wish I
could have spoken up more about it while
I was actually in it and I wish I could
have been that vulnerable to do it but I
guess I just wasn't at that point where
I could and I am only saying that is
because I know how much watching other
people's things when they speak openly
and are vulnerable how much that does
help me because humans we like to put on
this facade that where we've all got our
 sorted and that being not okay is
weak or less than but it's not I think
it's such a beautiful thing and I'm
really starting to appreciate that now
because ever I start to fall into
tragedy or I'm like oh my God my life is
over I always know there's gonna be just
the most incredible uprising that's
gonna come right off them so that's kind
of where I am right now I just went
through these waves over the past months
I've been so happy having the best time
of my life over the past months by the
way it's not a deep depression it's more
or less just a nun tracing like airing
down everything that I know and believe
in and then rising it back up and
reshaping and remoting because I also
had to teach myself structure and
balance and that's what I'm trying to
put into my life now and how to be
accountable for my action I'm I'm going
in circles but what I'm trying to say is
pretty much it to completely lose myself
and I didn't completely lose myself I'm
still saying I never like had some major
major doubtful that happened lost yeah
but I had to completely just let myself
roam and experience and cry and feel
loved and feel hate and feel all of it
to
add to the person that I am to
understand more to grow more positively
because all I ever won in my life is
just to be the best version of myself
and what I realized is that I've wrote
this down like you know self-discovery
isn't always pleasant and it doesn't
happen overnight it takes time it can be
really really uncomfortable but you have
to push through it so you can get at the
other end and I was going through that
self-discovery phase where it just
didn't seem right and I actually
couldn't bring myself to post about it
online and that's fine because most
other humans don't have 400 or so
thousand people watching this right now
I'm at this point where I'm like oh hey
Katya when I go back from LA this trip
round and this is what I was kind of
going through while I was in LA some
people kind of catch that my vibe was a
bit off it was more or less because I
was so stuck in my head just questioning
what am i doing where am I going how's
this all gonna work out how can I
rebuild I realized that I needed to work
mom self-love I had it for a bit and
then I just let it dwindled I needed I
need to put more energy into that every
day it's it's the biggest task I also
realized I need to yeah be more truthful
on the things that I do that are really
shitty but then also be easier and nicer
on myself for the things that I do that
are amazing and give myself
praise for that and be proud and more
comparing to other people all I can say
is I guess going back to what one of the
girls asked is how are you feeling with
life right now I honestly can say that I
just feel reborn
I feel really condensed I feel
passionate which I've just missed
feeling that passion and that intensity
feel like fire
I feel like power I feel like a
goddess and that's cool like that's
taken me quite a bit of learning and
quite a lot of shitty experiences and
great downfalls and hires to come to
this point where I am
and in saying that people say you've
changed I haven't changed at all
my externals have changed my conditions
have changed maybe the way that I
express myself has change but I have
never changed I've only grown and
growing involves change so yes I have
changed I just completely you know but
it's not a bad thing why does everyone
look down upon change you might miss
certain aspects of what I used to do but
get excited for what I'm about to do if
you also asked what are my future plans
and what's what's next for Katya Milan
no she's not about to delete her YouTube
channel even though actually one point
if I'm being honest that I had a
complete freak out I almost left my
management and deleted my youtube
channel and Instagram and went and hid
out in the hills somewhere I almost did
that because I got a bit freaked out I'm
happy I didn't but right now I'm
focusing on things that I'm actually
passionate about which I have been over
the past moments but really taking it to
the next step so I'm working on a big
project I can't speak about the actual
projects that I'm doing you will find
out about them soon they're really
exciting and they've just been so fun
for me to do like they've pushed me
they've tested me I've learnt new things
which I just miss I love learning and I
love trying out new things and testing
myself so I've got one really cool
project that you guys are gonna be able
to be a part of and have and really
exciting for me and then for other stuff
self development wise I've just been
working on my health my fitness my
happiness my mind my spirituality which
I will speak about more in this channel
because you guys just asking so much for
it and I'm not gonna hold back anymore
because I just don't give a if
people think I'm like some crazy weirdo
what is the point of holding back like
simply like why do we hold back on so
much we hold back on what we want to say
on how we want to feel and all it is is
if you want to feel something if you
want to do something if you want to be
someone if you want to be you just have
to do it it's
it's easy it's hard as but it's
easy you just have to take steps towards
it and working towards bigger projects
how can we take this little family that
we have and how can I involve you guys
more like how can we all be a part of
each other's lives and help each other
grow and develop and then help other
people and other people and just start
making waves in this society
because there's so much going on
and everyone just needs a little bit of
love I don't know like I just feel
energized and I'm ready to just step my
game up and just be better not only for
myself but for you guys because I
 owe you all everything and I
really do mean that like I'm actually
like shocked and just it's crazy that
you guys just know what's up like you
guys know when I'm not in my like best
zone like you know when I'm a bit of a
 you like call me out on things and
you like make me actually think like
 no I need to like step up my game
and I need to be I want to be my best
self for you guys and for myself and for
my friends and for my family and for
humanity like we should all be our
best selves for Humanity like it needs
that I'm just getting back to the basics
I'm throwing away all of the
conditioning that I've been put through
in my industry in my with the people
around me and my life I'm getting back
to who I really am my natural self my
hair extensions that out and they are
gone I'm never getting taping our
extensions again I will still wear like
clippings this may not seem like a big
deal but if this is like you know that's
my image the boys probably know me with
cardio with the long hair like the hair
the hair the hair and simply I used the
hair as my like safety guard for so long
if I'm just being completely honest my
biggest insecurity was going out without
hair extensions in because I was always
very self-conscious about my body and
now that my body is finally like I'm
letting go of so much excess emotional
weight I feel more comfortable now to
just be me
no eyelash extensions like just getting
rid of all the excess that I don't
need and obviously like I can put that
stuff in when
I want to feel like glowed up and stuff
so expect lots of inspiring content or
just shitty content expect whatever I
can't promise you that I'm gonna be
doing creative films all the time I
can't promise you that I'm gonna upload
every single week but I can't promise
anything because I don't even know what
the I'm doing tomorrow how I'm
gonna feel tomorrow but all I know is
gonna try my best have no expectations
just come along with my little journey
if you want you don't have to be a part
of this I mean it's nice to have you
guys yeah summer is just around the
corner of me I'm just doing so much fun
stuff and I'm gonna try and film
everything and I'm just getting back to
my fun editing and I'm writing I'm
writing so much that I can't wait to
share with some really deep that I
would probably never speak about but I
feel like we're just gonna go for it and
talk about it I'm just getting back to
the me that I've always seen and felt
but I'm just figuring out a better way
to show it to you guys anyway so so I
can loan oh my god I feel so
much happier for doing this and I'm so
excited and I'm gonna be bringing you
guys the content that you want to see in
the content that I feel like you guys
might need but obviously I miss being
real if they do work for brands I love
all the brands that I work for
I'm just saying straight up like let's
be real obviously I get my money
from brands and doing promo jobs that's
never gonna change that is just how this
world and industry works it's straight
up but I always I promise you guys I
always try and make it creative so it's
interesting to watch but I'm never gonna
promote a brand that i don't genuinely
love and use i've turned down a lot of
money and will continue to turn down
friends that i don't genuinely love and
use just thought i'd say everyone says
that but i'm just i'm reassuring you i
promise you guys you see i try and
incorporate brands creatively I'll keep
trying to do that even the comments why
you subscribe to my channel in the first
place that would be really nice to see
I'm really intrigued about that why did
you guys sign up to watch this wacky
little witch it's got a lot of my chest
I don't think I've spoken from like
like that is just me talking from the
most absolute on its place in my heart
so don't even think about trying to
judge me don't even think about trying
to be negative in the comments if you
want to be negative get the Frick off my
channel it's not acceptable unless I've
said something really out of line then
pull me up
do it respectfully I just simply if I'm
gonna be putting my life online and
putting so much energy into trying to
help other people and express my human
condition I just demand respect and I
see I get so upset I'm really lucky like
you guys are angels but I see
other people bashing other people and
their YouTube channels for little tiny
things like don't comment hateful things
it's really bad karma someone's gonna
like come trip you or like you'll be
eating ice cream and they'll just bit Oh
bump and you're gonna drop your ice
cream so just be nice karma is a thing
everyone says to me it's the last thing
I'm gonna say by the way everyone's
always like how do you attract such
great things in your life and great
people because you get what you
put out the energy you push is what
you're gonna receive so remember that
and just be a good person don't don't
try and like make someone have a bad day
it's just gonna come back to you so
let's be positive I love it when you
guys talk to each other in the comments
I read everything I love it when you
guys support each other's growing
channels as well like just help each
other let's be a family like we always
have been and thank you guys for
sticking it out of me for this
long you're all insane and I love that
