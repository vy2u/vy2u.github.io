month are we up to oh my god August
favorites video you guys know how
favorites videos works I'm just going to
be showing you my favorite products that
I've been using all month of August I
have a few like really random things I'm
gonna be showing you guys but before we
get started if you're not already
subscribed to my channel and don't
forget to go below and press the
subscribe button also don't forget to
follow me on Instagram Twitter snapchat
and on tumblr let's just drop in to my
August favorites okay first I'm gonna
sign off for this one now this may seem
really random but I want to make my
favorites actually my favorites like
what I've been loving and not just old
beauty and clothes and stuff but at the
moment I've been loving putting fresh
flowers in old liquor bottles and I just
think it looks really cute I kind of
with styling with my house I'm have a
very eclectic style I like lots of
different random stuff but I just love
the look at this it's so DIYs well like
you don't have to go out and buy
expensive decorations and stuff just
make do the kind of things that you're
ready to have in the house these flowers
smell incredible so I have three beauty
and skincare favorites I'll start with
one that I have honestly used to death
what almost them I'm he's older but this
one I'm on my second bottle of this
already this is the one night stands
everyday gradual tanning foam um I love
this stuff it's actually a new product
of theirs that I just got recently and
it's pretty much just like using gradual
moisturizing tanner but in a foam so
weirdly enough for me I prefer this I
use I normally don't really like the
moisturizer gradual tan it's just
because I'm too lazy to every boy
strives I hate feeling sticky and just
like waiting for it to dry and why I
love this is that it actually gets you
super tan this is all that I wore well
as in Bali I just put it on like every
second day or so and I got me
super super turned I normally just apply
this with my tanning mat how I would
normally put on fake tan because it's
literally the same it's just a clear
like liquid in here and I love the photo
things I've blurred in hey I just like
the fact that I can just put it on with
the tanning mat and it dries really
quickly this is my first beauty product
favorite I am obsessed with this stuff
he's second product that I've been
loving this is my new all-time favorite
cleanser like daily cleanser I used to
use the MD formulations cleanser um I
ran out of that ages ago and I just was
using like random stuff my skin started
breaking out and then when we were in
America
yes and I went for a facial at Kate's um
oh the lady that didn't have facial
recommended she got this face wash and I
started using all of yeses and then when
I get home oh I need to buy some of this
stuff this is just the Kate Somerville
exfol exfoli Kate cleanser I don't know
what it is about this stuff that I love
so much it just cleared my skin and made
my skin feel so nice and hydrated and
just like YUM like I don't know how does
it explain is he young but like I don't
know I just
it removes makeup really really well
like I don't have to use on makeup wipes
when I use this because it just gets
everything off my makeup off and it
cleared my skin so quickly and it's just
a really good daily cleanser to use and
my third like beauty skincare favorite
for this month is this chia seed oil
from souk in I used to literally swear
by rosehip oil I use on my face most
mornings and night and then so you can
send me some of their products like test
down just see what I thought of them and
I was like oh chia seed oil like I've
never heard of that before I tested it
out and I'm in love with yourself I am
at the bottom of it now like I have
barely any left I'm so sad I have to go
and pick up some more this stuff is
incredible for scarring and for facial
hydration what it has on the side here
is that the ingredients are Omega 3 and
6 antioxidants and amino acids and
thyroid treants or something like I
don't even know what the other one is
there but I'm how does I don't know it's
just so clearing for the skin it's
really helped get rid of a lot of my
scarring on the side of my face
ok my next favorite for this month since
you guys have asked me to start speaking
about crystals a little bit more because
I have heaps and heaps of crystals my
favorite crystal for this month it
I've just been gravitating towards and
I've been loving is my big rose quartz
crystal I got given this crystal when I
moved into this house by a really good
friend called Julia and it is literally
the biggest crystal I have been putting
this next to my bed every night I've
been like always trying to hold it and
have it around my space and I'll explain
a little bit about rose quartz I'm
pretty much rose quartz is almost like
whenever I see a rose quartz I think of
love it holds quite a feminine energy so
this systole is linked with the heart
chakra kind of helps with like
dissolving emotional wounds or fear
maybe or just any kind of a king or I
don't know like most crystals can always
help with any problems kind of going on
but I feel like it's more associated
like with the hot and when you just feel
like you need a little more love I feel
like it helps with giving to others and
also brings an energy that helps others
give back to you as well I also started
putting this crystal next to my bed when
I was having really weird dreams every
night I wasn't sleeping properly and I
was just dreaming all night long and
every time I put this crystal next to my
bed it boys with a I have like much much
more peaceful sleeps and much nice of
dreams so I can definitely help with
that so yeah that's a bit of invention
about rose quartz I just find it's a
very calming stone it's such a warming
and loving started I think in my
favourites for years every month I'll
try and speak more about crystals I've
been loving and I have a few others I've
been loving this month but this is
definitely being at my favorite and
probably all forever always be one of my
favorites because it's just such a
beautiful crystal and it's such a lovely
gift it's a little random piece of
jewelry that is in my favourites his
month of these wacky um little orange
star earrings just like for plastic
earrings that I got from a thrift store
in LA for literally 20 cents and I've
just been obsessed with these this month
because honestly like I just love random
pieces of anything with clothing items
and like I just love adding a random
touch to an outfit to just kind of make
it a little whack here and just put my
little edge on it so I've been obsessed
with these and my favorite drink this
month has
being shy I'm a huge coffee drinker but
lately I've been lying to have chai
sometimes instead it's winter over here
it's been super cold and I what I love
doing is on I have like a Nespresso
coffee machine it has like a milk
frother I love like froth up almond milk
in it and then I make the chai and then
you put like you put the are milking and
it's all frothy and then on top of the
froth you put a little like sprinkle of
coconut sugar and you're like eat the
froth and it just tastes so good it's
like very it feels like like a pumpkin
spice latte type of vibe like something
like that but it's just so so ummm I
don't really know the difference between
much chai but of course I kind of just
went for a try the other rain Mona this
is literally called rainbow chai and I
don't know where you can buy this from
like Byron has lots of different health
food stores that sell all this stuff so
that's why it's kind of easy to get I'm
sure you can find this around or any
other different types of chai around you
guys are always so sick of me talking
about this but my favorite book this
month is still the power now I've been
honestly talking about this book for
like 3 months now and you guys will be
honestly shocked and horrified but I
haven't finished it yet when I said I
was the worst reader ever I was
seriously I'm serious like I'm the worst
read I can pick up a book like a bit
like charge through it and then I'll get
to a point of it and like something will
come up and I just not being the right
headspace to read it so I'll put it down
for like ages and then I'll come back to
it and like a little tattoo on my wrist
I don't even know if you guys can see it
and it says now in running riding and it
was inspired by this book and when I got
the tattoo I was literally only like a
quarter of the way through the book and
it just had influenced me so much it
helped me a lot like push through
certain things or switch my mind said a
bit so I put it put this book down
literally off to America and just kind
of forgot about it and then I picked it
up again this month and I'm now finally
a woman's finished it I love Eckhart
Tolle's work lots of his other stuff is
really amazing too but he just has a
really great way of putting things if
you guys haven't already picked up his
book or heard about our anything
definitely check it out I just love it
my next favorite has some t-shirts that
I picked up from Rome vintage is my
friend Friday's vintage store I went
down and visited her the other day and
picked up three new tea that I am
obsessed with the first one is this
Harley Davidson Teesha it's just gray
and it has the look on the front which
is a really different like Holly logo
it's one that I've ever seen before just
so I thought it was really cool and then
the back just has Holly Davidson as well
it looks like this
I just love big vintage tees and you
guys know I love the brand Holly
Davidson literally my favorite thing
ever okay this next one that I got from
Rome is definitely my favorite
it is so sorry I think it is just it's
like really bright colorful tie-dye
this shirt was so so bright and colorful
and I was there like loving bright
colors at the moment literally so ready
for summer to come back so I'm just
trying to like get ready all my summer
gear so the next thing I got from Rome
is this epic bright a long sleep Holly
shirt and it has like flames down the
arms this is seriously the coolest
long-sleeve shirt I'm obsessed with like
all vintage long-sleeve shirts I try and
get my hands on them all the time and
I'm in love with the color yellow as
well so this was literally perfect for
me and that's the fact Roddy snow Rome
