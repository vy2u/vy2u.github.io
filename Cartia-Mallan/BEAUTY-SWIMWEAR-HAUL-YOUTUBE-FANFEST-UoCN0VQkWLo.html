well I'm Katya Milan and today I'm going
to be doing a whole video so I've picked
up so much new stuff and I always do
this I accidentally order so much stuff
online I receive new products from pi/8
and C's or different places and I never
do a whole video and I always think in
my head like you should probably hold
that but I had a day to day and just sit
down and film one and there's so many
exciting products I want to show you
guys so let's jump straight into the
whole video I have started using some
teeth whitening products now I used to
be really against teeth whitening
because when I was younger I bought one
of those like teeth whitening toothpaste
and mom was always like don't buy one
they ruin your teeth and I used it like
for a month and my teeth became
extremely sensitive because I was kind
of like scared of teeth whitening
products I'm going to get my hands on
some teeth whitening products that
weren't going to do that to my teeth and
I was kind of freaked out by like this
time me on the market they have to put
your life mouth into that tray thingy
and then you put like the gel in it and
I'm like actually it's such a whip when
it comes to bad taste or and I did try
one once and it just I didn't like it
and then I was talking to Ronnie because
I've watched one of her videos where she
mentioned my teeth whitening pen and it
was really snazzy and cool so I watched
a video about it and then I decided I
would just pick one up for myself so
this is the hello smile teeth whitening
pen it is actually nice-looking compared
to some of the teeth whitening products
it out on the market it's just like the
little pen right here like a lip gloss
but it's not a lip gloss I'm putting it
on your lips that would not be nice you
just twist the bottom like you would as
if it was like a lip gloss and the teeth
whitening gel comes out of the top oh
you Jose you just like smile and then
you code it nice babies I mean you just
kind of like leave your mouth like this
for 30 seconds so I can kind of dry and
then you just leave it in your mouth for
20 minutes and if you need to wash it
out you can wash it out but normally the
taste and stuff is kind of gone away by
then I've used this for about a week now
and
stand up really good results okay so
that was the first product that I picked
up okay in the next few beauty products
I picked up I'm going to speak about
them very quickly just kind of touch on
them
it's one of the PR agencies that send me
some products sent me a big bag of
goodies for stuff come out to summertime
so I thought I'd share the ones that I
liked with you guys so the first one
that I'm actually obsessed with it's
freaking amazing it's the Jergens
natural glow
I think that's a set Jurgens georgians
natural glow color primer it's pretty
much just like a pre ten exfoliator
or they call it like a skin primer but
what I like to do before I fake Chan I
can get my exfoliating minute put some
of this on it and scrub it all over my
body and I used it like just this
morning before I faked head and my skin
is so soft
that's my the first product that I like
from what they sent me oh yeah another
the other dragons product that I also
received I haven't tried this one yet
but it is the natural glow 10 extender
so it preserves your 10 up to 7 days is
he always does this when she fake tan
she uses is not just to normalize a bit
of 10 extender moisturizer and it always
keeps her turn for way longer I don't
know why but I've just never used one of
these before and so now I was like I'm
gonna try and do that because I'm so
sick of my tail sink like not very long
getting patchy like I want it to still
be really well not necessarily not
lasting long but it just the colored
starts to hang on I want it to just be
vibrant in the whole time so I think
this will be good to try out just to see
how it works and I think yeah these are
from the same like product family so
they should probably work well together
next your products I use this morning as
well and the first one is the Avenger
joy by Electra Joba oil
sorry if I say that wrong but it's from
the jojoba company and it this is the
botanical hydrating face mask I smelt
this and it smelt really refreshing like
it smells kind of like a like when you
actually go to a proper beauty spa it
says a plea hydrating to rebalance
dryness and reenergize your skin so I
used it this morning and when I first
put it on I was like oh holy that's
gonna make me break out like this is
oily kind of but not oily it's just like
a very thick moisturizer almost and so I
left it on for like 10 minutes or so and
then when I was in the shower I washed
it off and after it my skin felt so nice
yeah really re-energized revitalized but
I would not recommend this product for
anyone with oily skin or problematic
skin you might just feel like it's gonna
cook lock you up even more but if you do
have dry skin definitely try this it's
so nice on your face like my face feels
like a baby's born now so after I use
this product I spray why are all of
these names confusing why why can't I
say them I don't know musk you must um
USQ musk I don't know you can look you
can see the product right here there you
go that's what it looks like but this is
an antioxidant toner and it just has
green tea grapefruit and neroli in it
and you pretty much you just spray it
across your face after you cleanse your
face and I really like this and it's
just really like I'm trying to like me
you sometimes sting my face this one was
just like spraying water over and it
smells good it's refreshing let's move
on to the makeup get ready guys's this
is neck level I'm looking at it on the
floor now and I can actually lift it off
with one hand it's kind of like an
update as well as like a whole on what
products I got this story behind it so
I'm actually signed with um style Hall
which is like a youtube management kind
of thing
beauty bloggers and stuff and so they've
collaborated with benefit at um YouTube
FanFest so they asked me to be a host at
one of the benefit master classes and
I'll be there within another youtuber
who you might know as Saturday nights
alright or she goes by the name of
Karissa and I watched her videos for so
long so I'm really excited to meet her
she's so beautiful in her videos
freaking Rock so I will be that's like a
little update I will be at fan fest
which is so exciting like it's just so
weird I don't know I like I love going
to events like that because I get to
meet you guys and I always end up going
home feeling like so happy after I met
you guys because everyone always says
like can you do a meet up and stuff and
I just never really have time to
organize a meet up or anything like that
so it's really great that I can be there
with other cool youtubers and meet them
and meet you guys in a really fun loving
environment so that's my story so from
that benefit saying hey we'll send you
out a big goodie bag of stuff you can
try it the products get to know them so
I can show people then how I like to use
them for the master class and I was like
I'm down for that
you go ahead send me the products I will
learn about everything to do with them
and oh my god so this morning I open up
parcel and this is like a real legit
hole like this was delivered at my door
this morning so let's just stop hi
product stuff I'm a lot of you guys know
if you've watched previous tutorials my
favorite old-timer star is actually the
benefit they're real mascara
they sent me 3 3 different colors as
well so they sent me black blue and
brown and I'm so excited to use the
brown one because I loved Brown makeup
products and I just think this would be
so nice on the I I'm sorry I'm happy
about that I love this mascara they also
sent me the roller lash mascara I
haven't heard much about this but it's
not to use it as well but I'm so so
excited about I'm wearing it today this
is the they're real push-up liner so you
guys would have seen it when it kind of
was first released there's some pretty
big hype about this product it's like a
gel eyeliner but in liquid liner form
type thing the product looks like this
they sent me a black one and a brown one
I actually have the brown one on
now if you can properly see that button
hopefully a little squishy top and you
twist it from the bottom for the product
to come out now
am I like mini little review on this
from using this morning one I love the
color the brown is freaking awesome and
can't say benefits packaging for all
their products is divine like my props
to you benefit the other eye product is
just I makeup remover okay next we have
some face products you guys are probably
saying all these products before but I
am such a noob and I haven't bought new
makeup and so on so they're all new to
me and I'm really happy I don't want to
make this tool and clapping you at them
so I'm setting it like a quick review
and then move on if I've used them say I
have the professional pore minimizer
like primer I use this this morning love
it don't have anything else to say it's
awesome
the high-beam liquid highlighter so I
have that on right now - really
beautiful like pearly Joey color I love
the color of it Benny tint so rose
tinted lips and cheeks day sent a bottle
of sauce - wasn't a scared to use this I
think I'll probably screw it up but
let's give it go hoola bronzer which is
all over the place you guys would have
seen this definitely and also the shovel
rod and the sugar bomb blush and so
hoola bronzer I think it's really great
if you have fair skin or I guess can
skin but I just women I like really
intense bronzy and intense like
definition and whatnot so I think I
don't know I guess I would probably use
this if I wasn't fake tan but if I was
fake tan I don't think I'd use this
product I haven't tried this one yet but
it looks pretty I love this packaging
eyebrow kit so it's for browsing so it's
just like this and this is my color
medium and also for a face product they
sent me the it's potent eye cream
Shawny talk about this I know Shawn is
used the benefit skincare stuff and it
was either this product that she's loved
or like the face cream I'm not too sure
and never used an eye cream before so
once again I'm excited to try it out the
next one is the ultra plush lip gloss
and I just freaking love the packaging
of this it's so cute they put a little
bow on the top which is nice this is in
the color foam and looks like this color
second last I have the Posie bomb
hydrator tinted lip balm finally they
also sent me me bro in the color medium
to date which I use this product I have
my eyebrows right now I highly recommend
this product I think it's super great so
that's everything for beauty and makeup
product now I just have some swimwear so
since it's coming into summer here in
Australia saying freaking finally winter
makes me go crazy so I've ordered quite
a few pairs of towels in preparation for
someone's no way I feel like when I
order them like a little bit before
summer I'm so much more motivated to
like go to the gym and work out eat
healthy cuz I'm like I'm gonna look
freaking awesome in those togs first off
I ordered two pairs of swimmers from
ASOS and the first one is my absolute
favorite it's the coolest thing ever
it's pretty others going to show you
it's this like blue metallic one piece
and just looks like doubt so it's got a
low drop back and the front detailing is
like an over-the-shoulder sort of thing
and then it has these extra things at
the front it kind of cuts your boobs
really nicely I fell in love with the
print of this it's pretty much just like
a frickin mermaid prayers just such a
beautiful blue tone next pair I ordered
I love the print on these ones too and
kind of like the cup of the swimmers is
the top part so it's like a high halter
next summer with a really really low
drops back the bottom of these you have
your really daring because the bum is
like scooped up so high so pretty much
all of your bombs out but I mean if
you've got a good booty you'll be sweet
you're up there is a pretty like
shortcut on the side where your boobs
are so you kind of get a bit of a side
boob gone but they look really cool on
in the next
got sent from evil twin so these are
super cool you just firmly supported
when you wear them so these have just
the yang print on them and once again a
really low drop back so that concludes
