exciting day that I wanted to blog for
you guys I'm hitting it um - princess
Polly HQ on the Gold Coast you're a
little photo shoot and film some collab
videos we're gonna film some challenge
videos and whatnot but I'm panicking
because I'm looking outside my window
right now and there's all these dark
clouds that I've just come across it was
so sunny before but we're supposed to be
filming like a lookbook outside the
field and it's gonna rain and that's not
gonna be fun anyways excuse the fact
that I literally have worn this necklace
in so many of my vlogs and videos and
stuff it just is like my only big
necklace that I can pair lots of things
and I'm kind of obsessed with it so I'm
gonna try and find a new necklace so
then you guys don't get sick of this one
so this is my outfit I'm just wearing my
poly the label leopard print place it
with my white fox boutique belt and my
white fox necklace on and I've got some
Tree of Life rings it's honestly about
too strong down
okay so I've just got into princess
Polly and I've just put on this little
outfit this is a wild folks t-shirt and
I have a little skirt on with this belt
we're just hanging out at the moment
getting some photos and stuff and it
organizing some outfits and then we're
gonna be shooting a questionnaire saw a
little beauty tips and tricks video and
the big bean boozled challenge as well
as like a little lookbook with some of
my favorite probably outfits and stuff
so pretty awesome up here there's lots
of little outfits all over the place and
accessories and boots and stuff I'm kind
of dying over all the pretty things I've
got going on like look at all these
shoes and the Sony's and oh my lord look
at the jewelry time out sitting over
there just being a momager and also can
we just take a minute to appreciate this
beautiful
of stunning boys I'm frothing this man
bomb give like what's hurt
I love this chopper and up here so calm
before this is my all-time favorite
Beauty hack that I use on a weekly basis
if you don't have any people's spot
cream what you can do is your toothpaste
that you use every day and night and get
a little bit of it and put a tiny little
blot on over your pimple your blemish
okay so I've just finished filming my
little tips and tricks it is hello Lee
I'm about it so just a little tips and
tricks video and now we're going to be
doing the bean boozled challenge I'm not
