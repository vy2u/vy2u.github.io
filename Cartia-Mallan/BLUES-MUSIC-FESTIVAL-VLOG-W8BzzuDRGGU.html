immediately stopped writing these
weather is so bipolar I've got no idea
what's going on so at home now yes he's
leaving bye did you have fun bye okay so
it is a few days off to Blues Fest
actually it's kind of like my still way
copped it on on time I okay explanation
so I often Yeahs left it is the last
clip that you guys saw um I was just at
home that was a Friday and we decided
that we would go back to Blues Fest for
the Saturday not because Jessie's
friends were going that night and um I
had a friend in Bayern that I wanted to
catch up with before he left to go
overseas so it all kind of worked out so
I decided we go back for Saturday night
back to blue so he did that and then
after the festival I went and hung out
with my friend
and um I was worth fun I didn't film it
just because it was just like really
late last minute and it's really hard to
see the festival anyways on the camera
at nighttime so I didn't bother um but
it was honestly amazing and I know in
this video like I didn't get to film
very much of the actual festival just
kind of the before bits and afterwards
I'm sorry about that but just it was
just like crazy there's so many people
around it's so hard to try and film when
you're there kind of thing if you go out
I mean but it was such an amazing
experience and the second night was
really awesome and I wish I could take
as everything that I counted Amy
anyways I'm going to end this vlog here
I hope you guys enjoyed my video I have
lots and lots of logs coming out really
shortly because these holidays I'm doing
heaps so keep an eye out for that I
won't have too many normal videos up for
little while just until I get
