very very requested um question answer
video now this video is on my usual
questionnaires videos this one has all
to do with boys and all things that are
involved within that I thought after
hitting 100k a little thank you to you
guys I'd get a little bit more personal
and open up to you guys a little bit
more and watch more open than revealing
my love life secrets so here we go sorry
about the lighting I wanted to focus on
my different and where I'm filming is
really dodgy lighting so let's just go
that also this video was supposed to be
filmed with yazi my friend but um we
started filming like late afternoon
outside and it got too dark and it was
just such a fail of an idea alright
let's get started I'm just scrolling all
the way up to talk you guys off to a
walk with ya
let's start it off Steph dial rugby
playoffs so forgot
Curtis moment with a guy I've had many
many awkward moments of the guys some I
don't really want to say on YouTube but
they I've had the classic one where
you've gone in for like you've both gone
in quite the same side but knowing me
like I make a joke out of everything
especially when it comes to one stuff
gets bit intimate or romantic I'll just
crack a joke in the middle of something
like so both might go on to turn it to
the same
we've stopped there and I've just gone
and linked his face and he's like what
is this crazy person doing it up per se
like like me trying to make it not
awkward makes it more awkward especially
Tibor and they can't tell awhile for
something like come on and what I'm
going to be licked on the fear have you
ever been in a relationship when I was
in like grade seven for like a few weeks
but I actually have never really been in
a proper committed relationship and
that's how I feel about it I don't
actually know how I feel about that how
do you get over a crush or rough
territory we're talking here now I
totally understand the feeling when
you're like really whipped off someone
you can't stop thinking about them just
like their little head is just literally
in your brain all the time it's
literally so hard to just be like remove
yourself from my head because I need to
get over you but I think honestly like I
know everyone says this kind of like
really annoying advice together but to
get over a guy really it just takes a
bit of time and some mental constraint
to try and to not think about that it'll
eventually come and then they'll just be
a day we're kind of be like alright I'm
kind of over them and you'll be like why
did I even like them in the first place
I was all dumb but yes time and just
getting back out there finding who else
there is around and FM sorting through
the boys like but no it's fine you'll
get over them one day
have you ever farted whilst on a date
with a guy
I'll be very embarrassed with that
biggest pet peeves when it comes to guys
my biggest my biggest pet peeves are
guys that are the biggest assholes like
I know that such a mentor thing but guys
I just think that girls are expected to
do things for them we are all equal in
this spectrum I hate it with guys still
kind of think that they're they're the
manly figures therefore they're above us
or above you know I just hate that when
my guys just act like girls just objects
to be thrown around nothing annoys me
more if you're a guy that does god I
don't know what why long head boys oh
look I don't know to be honest I I'm
just really into might serve you guys
like actually like chiller like
laid-back kind of guys and the long hair
I have no idea how I became obsessed
with that that it's just beautiful like
when they pull it off I think it's like
it's scruffy and it's just like like
they don't care that much and it's like
I like it a lot better than the whole
like I need to look sleek I need to look
perfect all the time kind of thing like
I just want it to be like whatever like
that doesn't make any sense with us how
how I would describe it have you ever
done something with a guy you regret I I
will have to say
it's kind of like iffy with me if it
comes to getting with a guide I'm gonna
like do something with the guy I'm very
picky like I'm not just gonna like I'm
not like the sort of person that's like
get with whoever the goddess thing
that's the norm I'm very picky like I'm
not just going to get with someone the
sake of getting with someone or doing
something with the diet just because I
feel obliged to so I think maybe once
when I was a bit younger I regret doing
something with the guy it was nothing
major though but like more often I loved
like kind of a charitable more I'm very
very onto it I'm like would you wear the
pants in the relationship and what's
your ultimate deal-breaker
um when I wear the pair in some aspects
I think yes but in some ways I'm more
just kind of like go for floats so an
ultimate deal-breaker
I'm seeing guys the ultimate
deal-breaker just being went really
boats not getting too comfortable and
it's not getting it's not fun anymore
and like what I hate like you get too
comfortable when I get too comfortable
something I think they're just like got
you
it's like two compliments stop and it's
like there's no more Flair any more and
I hate that I like I like you to be fine
and like be crazy like it's ongoing like
you not just life is boring
and everything besides boring so that
would be my deal-breaker a next question
do you ever make the first move
I do sometimes make the first move if
the guy doesn't if I like see you guy
across the room say we've got a prime
example let's call him Harlow Harlow
standing kosa room and I'm like checking
email like well look at this body like
like my friends look at this guy oh my
god oh so she's like I'm not one of
those dolls going to be like dancing
over there like giving inside I like and
not sure anything about it because
that's just leading come on I would
probably go home like oh why didn't I
say something so I if I see a guy and
I'm like I want to speak to you I will
100% go over and make conversation or
make the first move I think like girls
forget the guys also have like
confidence issues to evolve them aren't
just like crazy confident with girls and
the exact same us like we get nervous
speaking to guys they get nervous
speaking to girl why do I like make the
situation a bit easier and then
sometimes just go over and say hello
like half the time fairly like checking
you out as well or you can kind of tell
then want to chat most of the time
they'll be like oh sweet you came over
to talk to me first
like yes that's what I think in my head
north on man phones freaking love man
bomb oh my god I talked to Anna Anderson
Julia Stone there was just me men's on
like central I was like I saw no next
question
have you ever thought a guy was very
good-looking then one day realized he's
not music festivals are the devil like
in a mosh pit but it's just killer like
you're like dancing your life
this hottie over here and you're kind of
like dancing around and then like you're
walking out of the wash kind of talking
together and you look at him again Oh
worst kiss oh my god I hope he's not
watching cuz oh my god that'd be really
awkward
my worst kiss with my life first proper
kind of 12 years I ever had with my like
boyfriend at the time and we like
probably like hid behind my she's like
luck is and like everything that's not
like the kiss itself is horrible but
like the preceding moments like we like
stood there so hopefully I was so
nervous and then we like go for it we
both leave the same size and I was like
oh my god it was a horrible oh my I
would never yeah reverse cowgirl or
doggie you ever experience any really
weird and odd sexual encounters yes
what's the first thing you would do if
you're a boy hope you guys will enjoy my
little kitchen and the video and you got
to know a little bit more about me and
my types if you want to send down my
perfect long haired boy now from heaven
