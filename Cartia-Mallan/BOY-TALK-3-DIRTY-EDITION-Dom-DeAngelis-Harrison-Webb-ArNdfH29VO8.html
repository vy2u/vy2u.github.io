we're drinking some red wine she is yes
today we're doing another boy poke video
you guys like these and I put my two
funny little friends we're just a little
that's great we just did a video on
Tom's channel so it's like warmed us up
a little bit for these chats but we're
gonna do like that's a quite saucy boy
tote video because I mean we've done
g-rated boy talk videos on my channel
but I feel like you guys are the perfect
people to bring in to really see and
it's gonna say first if you are like
young young please don't watch this
otherwise I'm like asking some really
intense but I don't want to be from this
double team yeah
opiate you can watch I'm gonna be true
to only be honest and I can't wait so
it's gonna be a little bit of a mix
between a chat questions and would you
rather and we're just gonna ask
questions and chat about your sex lives
love life and some advice you want to
give to some girls on making a move
thank you
awesome I can move on then whatever you
prefer what do you prefer you like a guy
I'm making a move on you first
like right question going a guy I'm
making the move first or you making them
in first it really depends them it's a
penny it's like sometimes it's good if I
make the move but
they're not gonna follow up on the move
and then I have to chase for too long
I'll chase I definitely love the chase
if I know that I'm definitely getting
them but if they're like not quite sure
if they even want me yet then I'm like
fuck all the whole new thing if I'm like
okay yeah that's that's the one or what
I work on all right marinade with I'm
gonna yeah put the sauces and spices
my thing is if she's not giving anything
back
oh he's for this hard I'm gonna basket
thing I'm gonna persist Bob when do you
draw the line yeah when they just don't
you go to the end
I don't long until you're standing there
with them and you've got them like that
and you're going to go kiss them and
they go little few steps yeah Bobby I
need to give you a bit yeah acceptance
like yeah that way you know just deal
they would have given you a bit of that
if you're gonna go - exactly exactly
it's like a couple hints like I'm not I
you know I don't chase anybody like it's
rare if I treat someone that's like
you're lying
no what happened sometimes when you
chase someone I don't know well I don't
know what was the better than that
don't be chasing waterfalls guys should
always make the first move I don't know
if I don't believe in that no I don't
even I think a lot of a lot of cases I
make the first move cuz I know some guys
are really shy and I like aggressive
girls like if you're aggressive because
I didn t want to get him with dog it
just saw him on the street and literally
it Levi's lady's neck and just choke him
to the floor and really is this what you
want for me that we discuss what is your
guy's real actual opinions on being cold
daddy
I think Ione I think it's funny I'm
gonna have kids one day I'm gonna daddy
and I know it's gonna be in the back of
my fucking head and I'm gonna go what
the fuck but other than that I've been
actually never been called daddy and
better or anything so that's good
I know Aires has many a time I don't
wanna watch it I just need to do it
you rather give hickeys or get them
passion why why do you have them oh you
mean like okay no just pretend that they
don't give you this like awkward-looking
scar in the moment of getting one would
you rather be like hey I'm filming and I
hate having it on me as well because
once like no you are a sensitive are you
anything in there like teeth and oh
that's too much that's too much but like
what if it was just like a little you
know like I guess again for that I just
don't like you
what are you I like together I don't
like to leave the skull actually another
one talking about hickeys yeah I I'm not
sure about I have some me personally in
my own life I will never do it to a
point where it's ever gonna scar
oh yes I know they want to leave their
mark so anybody it's really quite
embarrassing the nursing is immature I
think but they want to leave their mark
so anybody who run into the next day
it's like
like would you rather go all fifty
shades of gray on a girl or or have
someone go all fifty shades of gray on
I've never seen it it's pretty much like
being in yes what do you yeah it's not
your style from what i'ma show me go on
