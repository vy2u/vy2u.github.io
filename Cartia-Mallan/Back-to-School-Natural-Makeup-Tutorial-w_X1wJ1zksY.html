so today i'm going to be showing you
this super simple really natural makeup
look this is perfect if you live in
america and you're going back to school
soon or if you live anywhere else and
one a different makeup look for school
if you just like a really neat your
makeup look for a daily wear if you
don't really like to have like a lot of
cakey foundation on and whatnot then
this is the perfect look for you yes
let's just jump straight into it what I
normally like to do before I put on any
of my makeup is to prime my face but
instead of using a primer for school I
just like to use my moisturizer because
I don't really want to like use up all
of my primer just for school thing comes
off anyways using this soak in a shawl
moisturizer and I love this I'm like
almost run out okay so once I've
moisturize my face and I like to conceal
my dark circles because I get really bad
dark circles under my eyes so I'm
putting on my instant age rewind dark
circle eraser and it's just this
Maybelline one I love this stuff like
it's so good just quickly whip it on
under the eyes and then up you go
I just put like three kind of swipes
they're very pretty and then I'm just
taking my it cosmetics 2nded
double-sided brush thing and blending it
into my skin and I also kind of like to
work the product over my eyelids
sometimes I got some like discoloration
there and I also just with that product
I blend it down across all of my face
because instead of having to put on a
full foundation or anything normally
like my brush ready has some products
still lives in it so I just sort of
blend that in a little bit so then I
just don't want like I don't want that
much makeup on my face of school I feel
like it's too cakey and everything so
this is just what I like to do I just
put on the concealer and blend it down
and also like blend it up on my forehead
okay so once I've done the concealer and
sort of blended it around my face
randomly Oh actually if you do want like
a concealer that has more coverage or
you won you don't want to wear like a
full foundation but you still want that
concealer coverage um that one's pretty
light coverage like it
doesn't like dramatically cover anything
it just is really good for brightening
under the eyes but if you wanted
something with more coverage to cover
maybe some acne spots or scarring you
could use the Mac Pro Longwear concealer
that's probably the other option that
I'd use if I had like any pimples next
I'm just going to be powdering my face
with my Mac Studio Fix pressed powder it
just sets all of the concealer in place
while also giving you like a little bit
of coverage so I just like to dust a bit
of this over my face I don't really like
to put too much and I also just blend it
down my neck so that is the powder done
now I just like to do is fill in my
eyebrows I literally even if I was
wearing no makeup I always have to fill
in my eyebrows I just think that they
shape your face so nicely and if your
eyebrows look good then you'll look fine
so I'm just using my Smashbox your
powder set to fill them in
I don't always like to wear bronzer to
scope like if I'm feeling really pale
sometimes I'll put in a little bit of
bronzer so what I will usually do is
take my NARS Casino bronzer and this the
I'm it's the Real Techniques blush brush
but I like to use it as a bronzer brush
and I just like to take a little bit and
just apply it to my cheekbones and like
run it a little bit near my forehead and
temples so as you can see it's just a
really nice natural kind of bronze e
tone nothing dramatic at all and then
finally for the face I just like to add
a bit of color with some blush so I'm
taking my Mac blush in the color dainty
which is a really natural kind of pink
color and I'll just be applying that to
my cheeks with my large angled contour
I'm f40 Sigma brush I love this blush
brush and then I just blend all of that
product out with my face brush now once
all that's done finally I just like to
add a stack of mascara I just pump up my
eyes because since everything else is so
minimal um I just want to bring
attention man into my eyes so I just put
on a lot and a lot a lot of mascara as
everyone knows that that's what I like
love to do I love the look of big lashes
taking the Jordana best / extreme
volumizing the sky which is literally my
holy grail mascara oh my god it's
amazing and it's so cheap this is
literally probably the most
time-consuming part of my makeup because
I sit here for like so long just like
layering and layering and layering it on
and I also just like to add a bit on to
my bottom lashes and then finally what I
like to do is add either a bit of lip
balm or it's nice glossy pink lipstick
which I'll put on for you today but
normally I would just wear lip balm but
for the sake of the video just show you
this this is my Revlon lip stick and
it's like the lip butter ones which I
love them they're so good and this is in
the color of pain
lemonade so this is the final makeup
look I'm sorry this wasn't really too
exciting at all but it is just super
simple but I hope you guys enjoyed it
don't forget to go watch some of my
previous videos which I'll link down
below and don't forget to follow me on
Instagram
please like this video if you want to
see more more softer neutral makeup
looks not so heavy on the face makeup
and what not in times it's nice to have
a break from not wearing like a whole
lot of makeup also in Australia
obviously most of you know that I live
in Australia and we have to wear
uniforms here I'm like in America where
you guys don't wear uniforms but I got
this t-shirt recently I've wrongly calm
which I thought would be perfect for
some of you as a bit of an school day
the inspiration sort of thing it just
looks like this it is so cute it's like
a little crochet top and I'll just zoom
you out and show you little tassels on
the bottom and little tassels on the
arms as well and yeah it just looks like
that yeah I just thought that could be a
little tough to show you guys that I'm
loving at the moment and yeah so it'd be
perfect for a school day something
really simple and you can wear it lots
of times over and over again just mix up
the jewelry so I just sort of paired it
with the end few rings on my hands and I
stole these from my friend easy thanks
Izzy and yeah so I just want to quickly
mention that because it's very cute and
I don't I don't know I don't really know
what you guys wear to school it's my
uniform and that just saves so much
effort of trying to figure out what to
wear everyday but yes I'll stop talking
now so yeah thank you all so much for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
