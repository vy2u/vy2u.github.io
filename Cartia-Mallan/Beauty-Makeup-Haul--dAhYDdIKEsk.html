whole video I just started to quickly
say um new to YouTube I'm really awkward
talking to the camera so you have to
excuse me in this video but I'll do my
best okay so um basically today I went
into the city and I went to Mecca as you
can probably tell the best makeup store
I meant Emeco and got some stuff and I
also went to Maya and picked up some
stuff and a few little lunch product so
I'm going to show you okay so to start
off oh just shut off um oh I got the
it's really cute so I'm gonna do with
makeup but I set this little cow thing
like to wrap your hair in it and it
partly like dries it so I'm going to
test it out it's really cute look at
this thing okay so one of my favorite
things that I've been wanting to get for
a really long time I love knives it's
the NARS blush in the color orgasm which
is like one of their bestsellers a
little container I'll link everything
down below it's just this okay so you
can kind of see it when I hold it back a
little bit more it's really good it
stays on for ages like all of the nice
blushes like some of my favorites I also
like deep throat and super orgasm really
weird names but they're really good I
recommend them they are how much today
at $45 for that one it's pretty much one
of my new favorite blushes long some
other Macklin's
but yeah definitely go check it out I'll
link it in the little description still
a one-step color corrector and it
brightens your skin and you can use it
as like primer so before you put on your
foundation and stuff yeah minimizes
pores hydrates and balances and controls
oil like I know it's really random
whenever I first saw it I was like why's
the green and red and white yeah I'll
show you okay so
that's what it looks like sorry again
for the really bad you can't like see it
okay so this is it okay so it comes out
it's actually like blue and all these
random piles on my hand basically what
it does it's really nice it's like
really thin it's not thick or anything
it's just like a thin layer and it even
that's your skin tone and stuff but I'd
try the shoes it I was like before I put
on my foundation or something like that
so there's still a one step correct that
were 58 dollars so once again it is
really pricey but it seems to be good so
I'll try it out okay I also while I was
there I got this were really cute it's
one of the best sellers basically it's
cause um the makeup round cause they
have these little lip butters I just got
this one this is in guava it smells so
they also come in all different colors
there's like bright colors like my lip
there's pinks um and just normal lip
balms and stuff I don't know how much
that was okay so the next thing that I
got was the Smashbox camera ready BB
cream and it's got like SPF 35 in it
it's like foundation pretty much but
just a bit thinner so yeah that was that
and that one was $54 so I don't really
know compared to some of those I haven't
really ever tried BB cream before so I'm
just giving it a go but yeah that's made
for the stuff that I got from Maya my
all-time favorite favorite lipstick
everyone thinks that these are MAC
lipsticks they're not they're my
favorite they're these little they're
from nation a do I don't know how you
pronounce it or answers it differently
um
in my other video they get rid of your
video I showed one of them the the color
soft pink it's like you can't see it
again it's like the car that I wear
every day and there's other really nice
color rose it's almost like this one but
a little bit more pink and so yeah I've
also got they've also like a whole heap
of different colors but I've got a red
one of these like a bright red one and
last time that I wore it it stayed on I
didn't have to reapply it they're just
really good like I do recommend them
that's those and I think they're about
$15 or $12 not sure yeah
also got like a bit of a cheaper it was
really good this palette it's by Chi Chi
and it's um in bronzes they had like all
these different colors I was like
Naturals there was um Gold's I don't
know they had really random names I was
like all these different colored ones as
well considering how cheap it was the
eyeshadows are great like they stay on
really well um no like really bad fall
out which is good I hate having getting
like eyeshadows and they all fall out
really badly under your eye um this was
only $22 which is pretty good for a
pallor and - lush and I picked up some
stuff that I really like okay basically
I went in I got face moisturizer because
I've run out and hopefully in another
video I'll do a video on foundation
stuff but another really good thing that
I thought I'd mentioned because they
have new flavors in at the moment it's
the sweet lips and I know like a lot of
people of saying it's just like a little
container and it's this is um I don't
have this flavor anymore it's like the
best one vanilla and chocolate sugar lip
scrub so it's just like literally it's
like sugar with um they put all this
natural stuff it's just like oil
and weird things but basically I really
recommend it not just because like you
look at often it tastes good but I
noticed that you know how sometimes your
lipstick will get really um cracked like
your skin on your lips is really dry if
it's dry and crackly it's like an
exfoliator for your lip so as you would
explore your face deal with your lips
turn it helps put your lipstick on it
helps keep it off just so that I mention
that because I really like it and it's
all yummy pretty much I've decided that
I will keep posting videos so if you
like them subscribe to my channel
because I will be putting up more like
them share also comment stuff that like
you want me to do because I'm happy to
do whatever I was thinking also doing a
video on the look that I'm wearing now
like the red lip and everything so I'll
possibly do that well thank you guys for
watching sorry this is really awkward
and just to kind of pointless video but
I just thought I'd do it anyways um yep
so subscribe and I will be putting out
more videos soon and tell me what you
want to say and yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
