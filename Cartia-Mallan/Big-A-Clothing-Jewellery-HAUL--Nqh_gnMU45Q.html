have a massive hole for you guys in the
past two weeks or so i've gone a little
bit nuts with all my shopping i have so
so many new clothes and some really
beautiful new jewelry that i'm still
excited about and you guys are asking
for me to do a whole because you're so
lots of snapchats and all sorts of
different things with me going oh my god
look at all the new stuff that i got so
i just decided let's make one big video
so this is gonna be a bit of a long
video on my side don't get into it right
now so let's just don't start into it if
you want to see more holes like this
jump it to give this video a thumbs up
and it means the world to me so let's
just I'm all over the place again this
morning oh my god let's just get
straight into this so first off I'm
going to show you the things that I got
from Pinker Boheme which honest to god
this store is freaking incredible owner
of this store jasmine she melts my heart
we're like freaking biffle's we email
back and forth about all sorts of things
and she tells me that her little son who
is so cute and it's just you know like I
respect little businesses like that
owners are just beautiful and so sweet
and anyways I could talk about Jasmine
all day and how cute she is and how much
I love her company but I'm just gonna
jump in and show you the clothes because
oh my gosh she stocks just the most
stunning high quality clothing huh it
kills me I'm telling you so first thing
that I got from pink oh these incredible
bail pants they like a red kind of
velvety color with like like floral kind
of like patent thingy on them like a
shoe can see these pants are amazing
they're high-waisted which is what I
like so I can feel like I'm all secured
and sucked in and a little while ago
jasmine tagged me in one of the photos
she posed in she was like you would rock
these and I was like I don't know they
just seem small and I felt like I'd be
bulging out cuz my legs are a bit bigger
and stuff and I was really nervous and I
was like a kale just all of them and
just see how we go and I got them and
I'm
I'm obsessed mica booty look nice and
they just even if you do have bigger
legs like me somehow it works like you
can just kind of balance it out with
whatever else you wear it with so I'm in
love with these they are absolutely
stunning and I would kind of pair them
with these this is like a little crop T
or always put a longer tee over this
second thing which you could pair with
those pants is just really cute because
it's just a little basic tee and it's
got cute little white Android mint on
the side and I love the color of this
it's just like a dog brownie color and I
love these like neutral tones because
they can literally pair with absolutely
anything and it's so soft material and
it's just like a good throw over at the
beach top or a layer top like for winter
you can just put this under and chuck on
some necklaces and a jacket and not it's
gorgeous
the thing that I got was this absolutely
it's stunning little bra it just looks
like this is this really cute little
lace bra let lately I've been wearing
more bra let some bras because a lot of
my clothes are quite Shia if you have
like a low-cut tank it was nice because
you can just kind of see the side of it
out there or yeah as I said like a sheer
top
it's just perfect and it's so so
comfortable author and the final thing
that I got from panko which is my
absolute favorite I'm in love with it I
just actually died when I opened it is
this stunning dress from love-hate verse
here now this company is makes all
handmade silk clothing so this is pure
silk and this dress is by I don't know
what to even say like it look at the
color first off I feel like I've just
dipped into the ocean from where to
scarf what's the possibility is the
color of this is just this absolutely
science like greeny blues you have all
different colors in here the most simple
stuff and then
the sides of this dress have slits down
them which makes it kind of edgy and
really hard and I'm really excited
because I'm actually wearing this dress
to groove in the moon I hate to be a
spoiler because you guys will probably
see this before you see my full outfit
but you'll see how I end up styling it
because and it's just oh my god nice
because it is sheer so you can see what
you're wearing underneath it so pretty
much I just paired this with
high-waisted like black Underpants or
like if you have like those sucking on
pants they're always good to wear
because it just kind of looks no more
even if you have like high-waisted black
bikini bottoms that can work and I'm
just wearing it with a little black bra
and it just it's so cool I just love it
and then I just put a belt with it and
stuff I notice I'm gonna stop talking
about how wearing it to career because
you guys will see tomorrow is just
mighty Holy Grail honestly I can't talk
about it enough but I'm gonna ask you
stuff because talking really fast and
babbling and I'm really sorry
let's continue the second store that I
got a few clothing items from is my
favorite princess Polly booty you guys
know that I love princess Polly this was
just one of those other companies where
all the staff members it is so beautiful
and the owners are really great too and
there's like a genuine company and yet
they always have really beautiful
clothes but I do have quite a lot of new
pieces from there
start out with my all-time favorite
thing that I got from there oh my god
Lee who is the buyer for princess Polly
like text and I texted her a minute that
they got this built in and I nearly died
I was like you're kidding you finally
got it in I had a little party this is
the layer belle princess Polly now
stocks this and a few of the other belts
can I just take a moment to appreciate
the beauty of this bill it has been
around for quite some time I've wanted
to get my hands on it for a just but it
sells out so quickly so now I finally
have it and it is just amazing has these
silver detailing on the front and then
the back is just like all of these
little buttons so
put in to where you want it to sit and
this is all real leather and it is just
amazing it goes with everything and it
just makes your outfit looks so cool oh
love it so much so that is the first
thing that I got from princess Polly
moving on to the clothing if you guys
follow me on instagram you would have
seen these two items i posted a photo of
it the first one is this just t-shirt
that said little baby boo boo I'll stop
that can't express to you how soft it is
it's like this stretchy soft material oh
my god in a second clothing item that
you would have seen on my Instagram to
it which I paired that shirt with is
this really cute thingy and it has
buttons all down the middle it just
looks like this and it has little place
to put a belt which is really cute
because it does look really nice in the
belt
this skirt is kind of perfect for coming
into winter because you can pair it with
some high boots or low ankle boots or
some stockings underneath it with a
long-sleeve shirt and the next thing
that I got from Princess Pollock's this
really cool t-shirt with a big Sun on it
I think it was so beautiful and the
color is really vibrant and really cool
so you can pair these with some little
shorts and a jacket or you know I don't
know like it's always good just to have
a big oversized tee in your wardrobe you
can chuck it on over tall so just for
comfortable wearing and also style this
really well I just love it gonna moon
and the Sun and it's just so pretty and
Lee was like this has got you written
all over a girlfriend and I was like yes
it does you know me too well
the final thing that I got from princess
Polly is this stunning big
fluffy warm turtleneck jumper this is
definitely one of the biggest things
that is in trend for winter here in
Australia at the moment this is so so
warm and it's not too heavy it's just
perfect I'll get up and show you guys
how I've styled it like you can either
just wear it by itself or I've just put
this little necklace under it with like
little adjustable strap so I'm just kind
of roll it up the sleeves a little bit
yeah that is everything that I got from
princess Polly if you guys know me you
know I love my big silver kind of
bohemian necklaces and I have three
three three not six just three to show
you guys from Missouri I think that's
how you pronounce
it's a beautiful jewelry store all that
pieces make me melt here they all are I
have three big silver necklaces to show
you I start with my favorite which is
this incredible choker necklace it just
looks like this little silver beads at
the top and then has these beautiful
silver teardrop plots and the big one in
the middle and it just sits like up and
around your neck here and the quality is
incredible and you just kind of hook it
in there so you can adjust it wherever
you want to I love layering this one
with the other necklaces this one it
just looks like this and it just sits
kind of like that it's beautiful it's
like little sparkly of layering the
choker with this underneath and then
with this final one no matter where like
long dangly jewelry but as I said I like
to layer these and even by itself it's
beautiful it's kind of something really
different which is actually I was really
nice with this top but it's just this
kind of longer change one with the same
daytime there and the big beautiful
statement piece down the bottom I just I
don't know I don't know what to say like
I think they sell themselves they're
actually stunning and the quality is
impeccable finally I have some more
clothing items and this is from her pony
and these clothes are absolutely
stunning once again first off I have
this t-shirt it's this long sleeve
cropped key with kind of bell flower
arms and it's just a wrap up top so it's
open like that and then you just wrap
one of the sides across the other this
top and this also comes in this print
but I just wanted to get a black one
because it is a statement kind of color
goes with everything and it's just
really beautiful and I compare it with
lots of stuff I've worn this so many
times already with skirts and shorts the
second item that I got is this
absolutely stunning
Mona I love the print of this it is so
bright and vibrant and has really
beautiful stars and moons on it and
science and I think it's really cute a
long sleeve
long-long kimono and I love kimonos that
is perfect to pair with simple outfits
or this add something extra to your
outfit and everything I don't know how
to talk about this stuff it all sells
itself it's freaking beautiful so
there's everything for all the clothes
that I got this month I'm really really
upset because I ordered a bunch of
jewelry of a website called desert
wanderer and I got it all the other day
and the pieces are coming and when I
went to grab all of the things from my
room that I wanted to haul I went to go
and find my little parcel bag with stuff
that doesn't wander I'll and I nearly
had a fit I literally turned my room
inside out and upside down to find this
little bag what must have happened
because I cleared out my room the other
day like I quit everything was putting
everything in bags and throwing it all
that one big rubbish bag that I just put
all my old parcel slips I put it all in
then I chucked him out
I have a feeling that I've accidentally
thrown out my possible bag with the
jewelry in it and I went down to the
rubbish room before to see if the bin
man who came and it's gone everything is
empty so I just am actually heartbroken
because I ordered these really beautiful
earrings off there and it's like hand
peace and it's necklace and I really
want to show you guys I'm gonna have to
reorder them because I throw them out I
feel like an idiot
but anyways besides that that's kind of
all the new stuff that I've gotten I'll
quickly mention because I know you guys
are probably off this little necklace is
from a doorman and it is really really
beautiful I think that's everything for
this video I hope you guys enjoyed this
