showing you how to get these gorgeous
big beachy kind of waves I love them
because they have so much volume and the
perfect for any sort of occasion or
event this hairstyle is so easy to
achieve recently I received my nume
lustrum curling one set that is what I
use for this video and I'll also be
giving a bit of a review on it as I go
I've been using this curling wand for
quite a few weeks now and I've been
loving it it always creates really
gorgeous curls no matter if you want
tight curls or loose curls it's an
awesome product and if you guys stick
around towards the end of the video I
have some coupon codes to share with you
so you can get this a bit for a little
bit cheaper and yeah it's definitely
worth it I love it a night because I
always curl my hair having something
like this with all the different options
of the different ones it's perfect and I
will step you through all the different
ones right about yeah okay so this is
the box that the curling one set comes
in and my favorite part about this is
that the ones are all placed in this
little bag so it comes with the glove
and then here are all the ones I will
arrange them in order so first of all
this is the smallest one which is 19
millimeters and then we have the
medium-sized one which is 25 millimeters
and then we have the biggest one which
is 32 then we have the reverse wand and
finally the pearl wand then at the end
we have the attachment where you clip in
the one that you want to use and today I
am using the medium size 1 which is the
25 millimeter and you just push it in
and if you're from Australia like me or
somewhere else other than America you
will need a adapter ok so pretty much I
just washed and blow-dried my hair
because unlike most people's hair my
hair seems to style a lot easier when
it's actually been freshly washed
because my hair is quite a heat damaged
so there's a lot of dead ends and
there's like it's just really dry so if
I leave it too long then it gets really
hard to style and it just
it's kind of gross I I have to actually
wash my hair before I style it
especially when it's curling I like it
to be really really fresh and looking
nice and silky but do what is best for
your hair and what normally will hold
curls a whole different styles so pretty
much I've just parted my hair down the
middle and also just quickly saying if I
keep looking in my monitor please excuse
that it is just because I have no mirror
so I sort of have to like use that so
please don't kill me I'm very sorry
um but okay so I just like to brush out
my hair and then before I start curling
my hair I like to take my heat
protectant spray now this is so
important
take it from me using heat protectant
spray is a must because when you use
heat products on your hair it is so
damaging and it really does kill your
hair mine is so dead that's why I had to
get most of it all chopped off but yet
he protectant spray is very good because
it can suck like still so reduce the
amount of damage that happens to your
hair when you use heat products if that
made any sense now I just brush that out
and let it dry okay then I will be
switching on the curling wand and then
you see a little light come on just wait
for this to heat up and in the meantime
I'm going to be sectioning my hair off
now usually I do my hair in three
sections so the bottom half the middle
bit and in the top half so I'm just
taking a hair tie and sectioning this
part off so just taking that bit and
I'll just pull up that top part since we
just won ahead I'll have like a lot of
volume and be really nice and wavy
that's why I'm using the medium sized
wand it's not too small so that curls
won't be like too tight but it's not too
big that the curls won't hold for long
enough so what I like to do is I like to
make the curls look quite a bit tighter
when I'm first curling it but then once
I finish all the curls when I style it
I'd like to put a lot of hairspray and
then brush it all out but we'll get to
that later
um but yeah that's why I'm using the
medium sized wand the great thing about
the new me
one set is that comes with a glove so
make sure you wear this so then you
don't burn your hand on your curling one
they like to start with the back so I'll
take the back bit and section it off and
we'll start with this strand what you do
is you just hold the one there and you
start to wrap it around now you always
want to curl away from your face you can
alternate your curls like back forth
back forth but for this look I'm just
going to be curling away from my face
and then once you're done let the curl
come out then we'll just continue that
on this part of the hair by go I like to
add some hairspray so the curls don't
fall out so then I'll just be taking my
hairspray and lightly spray not putting
too much in though okay and now for the
next side have to alternate glove hand
got in alright so for this one since you
want to curl away from the face you sort
of have to do like a weird arm Bend back
back around your shoulder sort of thing
I'm taking my piece and we'll just start
curling it around
there we go can same process put some
hairspray and gonna look a bit funny at
first because they're so like tighten
not nice
yet they like just fresh off the barrel
but just leave them let them sit um try
not flush them out yet or like get fast
about it just leave it and once you do
all of your head then we can stall it
I'm just taking a really thin hair tie
and what I do is I just pull up that
little bit like I just wrap it on that
twice just so then I don't get these
curls caught in the next set of curls
just like that
okay now I'm pulling down the rest of my
hair and I'll be sectioning off the
middle part and then the same process
for this section of hair ever I use my
new be curling one set i never feel my
hair drying out because since the wand
is made of toppling it pretty much
balances out the moisture in your hair
and it's always left feeling super nice
and silky and smooth and I just love it
and safety applies here just get the
hairspray and then I pull out the bottom
half and to pull it all up together now
finally the top section so pull out the
rest of your hair and I just like to
give it a bit of a brush through now
even if I am playing on doing my hair in
a side part I like to UM curl it all in
the middle part and then it kind of like
when you then like kind of puff it over
it gives this really nice effect which
gives your hair so much voluminous and
will start at the back and then move our
way up to the front
hardstark
do the same thing and just hairspray at
all once you've done that pull out all
of your hair like to do is I just like
to start by running my fingers through
it curling it up with my fingers to sort
of style it how I want it and I just
keep sort of puffing it up and this
starts to give it quite a lot of volume
it's pretty easy for my hair to get
volume because it's naturally quiet is
the word voluptuous I don't know I liked
but if you don't have hair like that
then what you can do is take some
hairspray I'm not going to actually do
it because I already have enough but
what you can do is you just hairspray
your roots a little bit up here and keep
pulling it up as you spray and then you
just keep doing that and then set it all
in place and that will give your hair
tons of volume sometimes I would just
stick with the middle part but normally
with these curls since my hair is quite
short I like to brush through the middle
and just put it into a sigh pot or
sometimes I don't actually brush I'll
just pull it over with my hand and let
it fall in the right spot and I just
also give the curls a brush through okay
so this is the final hairstyle I hope
