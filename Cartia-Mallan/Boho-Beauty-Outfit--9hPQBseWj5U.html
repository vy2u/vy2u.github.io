showing you how to achieve this really
beautiful bohemian makeup look and also
show you some faux he Mian outfits style
options now this is coming perfect time
if you're going to Coachella or any
other music festivals coming up I think
these looks are all really perfect for
them and they also are really beautiful
for just day wear as well for the video
today I'm using a lot of new products
that I've recently received from la
solocom so as I go through the makeup
I'm also going to be giving you my first
impressions and some reviews of the
products um as I kind of go through out
along with reviewing the products I also
have a little coupon code for you guys
that can get you the discount when you
purchase off La Jolla comm so I'm gonna
leave that coupon code down below in the
description box and I hope you guys
enjoy that there's so many beautiful
makeup products on that website and lots
of different brands that you can't get
here in Australia for one and it's
really convenient having them all in one
online store without further ado let's
jump straight into this makeup look and
then continue watching towards the end
if you want to see the outfits that I
have styled together I'm starting off my
eyes and I'm using my new Sigma palette
that I got from lux Ola I've fallen in
love with this palette and I'm just
taking this light kind of shimmer and
neutral shade all across my lid as a
starter off kind of color and then
taking a color really similar just with
more of like a grayish kind of undertone
a little bit dark I'm blending this into
my crease for a little bit more
definition
after this I'm taking a much darker
brown color and I'm just really lightly
blending this on my outer crease it's
looking at a really nice kind of natural
smoky look that kind of gives it that
bohemian longer that makes sense and
then on the little pencil brush I'm
taking this shimmery shade which has
kind of like a greeny on time you can't
really see it when it comes out but I'm
just applying this on my ena lower lash
line and then after applying the lighter
color I'm taking that same dark brown
again and I'm going to be applying this
on the outer outer bottom lash line that
makes sense
I'm really in love with these eye
shadows because they're really buttery
and creamy and apply really really
easily and one for my new liquid
from an inner voice I think yes what
it's called I'm just doing a winged
eyeliner look and this is my first time
using this liner and I'm happy to say it
is so wonderful for applying winged
liner it goes on so easy and you can
create the perfect wing with it because
it's got a really small tip so it makes
it really nice and precise once both the
liners are done I'm applying my mirror
it's nice maron s I'm not really sure
how to pronounce it but this mascara
this was my first time testing out this
brand and I actually did order a few of
their products the second product that I
got was the they're like liquid
foundation and I applied it with this
stippling brush and this is a totally
different foundation because it kind of
comes in this weird compact thing as you
saw but it is absolutely amazing I loved
it and then with my new Sigma large
powder brush from la Sola I'm going to
be applying some powder foundation now I
loved this brush because it was really
compact and it applied the powder on
directly where you wanted it and it made
the UM the coverage a lot if it builded
the coverage a lot more I guess you
could say then I've just gone ahead and
put on my brows and then I didn't have a
close-up shot of this products but this
is my sleek contour kit and they also
sell sleek on luxe Ola it is an amazing
brand and I love this contour kit just
kind of contouring and bronzing up my
face a little bit to give a bit of a
glowy bohemian look then for this
absolutely stunning blush it's more of
like a highlighter blush in one I'm
applying this on my cheeks and up onto
my cheekbones and this is kind of like
gives a really beautiful dewy glowy look
then with these lip glosses I'm taking
this one in the end which is kind of
like a rose gold color and applying this
all over my lips this lip gloss
literally smelled amazing and it looks
so beautiful so that's all for the
makeup now let's move on to the outfits
that I've paired together for this look
buckle bow to the Lord then wouldn't you
love to love fun who takes to make the
sky like a bird in flight and boy you
never say no take a bottle we would
slice she promised to
