showing you how I got this really
beautiful kind of a bombshell makeup
look it's really full face and with the
really lovely bright lip winged liner
and big big lashes I took inspiration
from photo of Marilyn Monroe I just love
this makeup look and the really fluttery
lashes I think it's really pretty and
really girly and I haven't done a really
full face makeup look like this in ages
so I was like let's just do that today I
am gonna be a little bit m.i.a or not
very active for the next few weeks just
because I'm really really busy at the
moment I'm going to exams and I have my
final say to show which where like every
afternoon every weekend I have rehearsal
so we're not really crazy I'm too busy
but I've taken today off to sit down and
film videos for you guys use my voice as
well and I sound like a man I'm really
sick as well everything's just going but
crazy at moon but it's fun we'll get
back on track shortly oh I think that's
everything that I want to say alright
let's just leave it don't forget to go
and find me on Instagram and on Twitter
I've been using my Twitter so so much
more my Twitter it's just cardio Milan
sans my Instagram so it's a lot easier
for me to respond to you guys via
Twitter than sometimes over Instagram
comments so yeah if you have any
questions and stuff it's really easier
to get up to Twitter and ask me because
I see them all on the little feed when
you tag me and stuff so yes I just
thought I'd quickly mention that anyways
I hope you guys enjoy this video
daddy
my eyes and I'm taking my soft ochre
Paint Pot from Mac and then I'm moving
on to just using my sleek contour kit
I'm just taking my bronzer it's just
this matte kind of dark brown color on a
little pencil brush and I'm just
defining my crease I know this looks
kind of funny but when you blend it out
it will kind of work so I've applied
enough that I'm happy with I'm just
taking a fluffy blending brush and just
buffing this in we're not really buffing
it just blending it out until I'm kind
of happy with it and it's just lightly
smoked up then with a light shimmer
eyeshadow
Culley literally is anyone that looks
like this I'm just patting this all
across the lower half of my lid and also
in my inner corners and I'm just
bringing it up towards the brow bone and
then also applying it on my brow and if
you don't want to shim it on you can
just use a modified one then with a
brown eye pencil I'm just putting this
underneath my lash line and then for the
statement winged liner I'm just taking a
liquid liner pencil and lining my eyes
and then with my there real benefit
mascara I'll be putting this all over my
lashes to prep them before I put on my
falsies I don't normally wear false
lashes way so I'd chuck them on for this
look because it is such a dramatic
bombshell look so I think these are just
old ones from Mac's that I used like
eight years ago now moving on for the
face I'm taking my Rimmel long lasting
primer thing it's called and then my two
shades of Make Up For Ever HD foundation
and I'm just using this stippling brush
and buffing this all over my skin I love
this foundation combo it's such a great
coverage when I want more like full face
kind of look and
I know I just love the way that it looks
kind of Julie but also Matt slide if
that makes sense and then my mac
prolongwear concealer oh my god I
haven't used this in a million years
excuse my phone I'm just putting this
under my eyes on the bridge of my nose
forehead and Cupid's bow and just
buffing this in to set all this makeup
in place I'm taking my Mac powder and
I'm just lightly patting this across the
the foundation and the concealer because
I don't want it to budge and I just want
more of a matte look for this inspired
makeup look
then I'm just gonna be defining my
cheekbones and also bronzing up my face
with my sleek contour kit bronzing
palette the one that you saw at the
start this it's the same color I used
for my crease I've shown a color and
then with this Mac blush that I can say
I think it's in the color margin is what
it's called I'm just taking this and
applying it on my cheeks and dragging it
up a bit and then with my Mac soft and
gentle highlighter I'm putting this just
above this and then on the bridge of my
nose and it fit on my forehead and above
my Cupid's bow then I'm just taking my
red lip liner pencil and lining out my
lips I think this one's from Mac as well
and you're not sure what the contain of
the color is but once I've lined my lips
I'm then just gonna use this pencil and
fill my lips all in
then to fill in any spaces I'm taking
rooby-roo and just lightly putting this
across my lips and then for a glassy
look at the end I'm taking I think it's
just like a Rimmel apocalypse lip backup
and just putting that over the top so
this is the final makeup look I hope you
guys enjoyed thank you all so much for
watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video and I'll see you guys next
time

kiss and it turned out to this Oh what
