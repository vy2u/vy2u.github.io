putting it hi guys okay oh my god so I
just finished filming a mukbang with
Ricardo and gee if I sound exhausted in
this right now it's because I literally
have a food baby I just what are you
like so much time food but bear with me
um but I was just editing this vlog and
I've just been thinking about a lot of
stuff over the past few weeks and I
haven't really had the chance to just
like sit down and like chat you guys
about everything that's been going on
and what I'm doing everything is just a
bit scattered right now so I thought I
would just sit down and talk about some
little life updates and also talk a
little bit about purpose and finding
your purpose because that's just some
things that I've been going through
right now so um it is Sunday right now
and in four days I'm flying to Paris and
then I'm going to London I'm so excited
um Josh and I fly into Paris together
and then we are meeting some friends in
London and obviously you guys know Izzy
she lives over there but it's going for
work and for fun and just who knows it's
a bit of a spontaneous trip which I'm
really excited about because I just want
to get out there in the world and just
get creative and live and go and meet
new people and experience new things I
feel like I've been working pretty
solidly like ages now and I haven't
really been doing like much spontaneous
travel or any experiences that are out
of like a super comfort zone pen thing
or doing that and I'm so excited for
that so I'll be gone for about three
weeks and then I come home and I have
splendor in the grass in July which is
literally my favorite festival all times
I'm so freaking ready for that and then
after that I'm organizing a trip with
some friends to Greece and Croatia and
maybe Italy for my birthday I turned 20
in July on the 20th of July which like
I'm literally like
even though I feel so much older than 19
it feels so weird to be turning 20 I'm
like it's very strange I've always
wanted to go to Greece like that's been
like the one place I feel a really
strong connection till I could
definitely feel like a past life linked
to Greece so I'm really excited to go
there it's like I'm gonna love it
literally I could not explain how fully
I'm like it's it's actually hurting me
really what else um I have literally
just been doing life like I've just been
taking every day as it comes and I've
been trying to read more and get back
into my journaling more and start
learning my I feel like I kind of fell
off track for the past few months with
growing and being accountable for my
learning and raising my consciousness
and spiritually aware and in touch with
stuff going on around me but lately it
has become really important for me to do
that again I think when it comes to
finding your purpose or refunding your
purpose I I can't tell you exactly
point-blank how because mine kind of
almost found me I didn't search for it
it was more about connecting with myself
and connecting with what made me really
happy and I think that you find your
purpose when you are doing what you love
and you connect with what makes ya you
happy what makes you feel inspired or
what makes you want to inspire others
like and that's Gnomeo purpose because
everyone has a purpose even if you might
think that you have no purpose on this
earth whatsoever like I promise you like
you have a purpose here you have a path
here and it's the most exciting thing is
finding that purpose and finding your
path and I'm still constantly finding my
purpose and finding my apartment it is
forever changing and evolving and once
you can accept that and you take all
pressure out of trying to find purpose
or your path or whatever that's where
the fun begins because it's like
literally I just always remind myself
it's not about the destination it's the
journey and so corny if it's so true
because you don't want to be at the end
destination yet like the most fun thing
about being a human or a teenager or in
your 20s and your 30s whatever we're all
still growing and learning all humans
are out of what age and the ups and
downs and the bumps and the
it's all learning and what's going on in
your life right now what what is around
you that is trying to like reoccurring
things like what's trying to teach you
lessons about things are you being
pushed in a certain way to bad things
keep happening to you like regarding
like say your relationship maybe that
means that this relationship is not
right for you
and you need to take a hint or with your
workspace or you keep seeing reoccurring
things that you need to like become
aware so that's why I find journaling
really helpful with becoming aware
because if I notice reoccurring things I
write them down oh it's always about
trusting your intuition and your feeling
and letting that lead the way with life
you just have to take a risk
you've gotta risk it to get the best it
as I say it but I think when you are
spontaneous and that doesn't have to
mean anything of money just saying yes
to things being fearless like not
letting fear hold you back I think that
is how you find your path and your
purpose is it doesn't come to you when
you're comfortable I feel like it finds
you in moments where you were
challenging yourself where you're
learning and you're growing and it's
just so funky and cool how that happens
first and foremost your purpose yourself
is just to be happy and to enjoy and to
be grateful for this life and then
secondly your purpose I guess with what
you're doing to fill your time like you
can do anything you want we have we have
no set rules as to what we do while
we're on this earth filling this time
but let's have trained my brain into
being okay with the unknown and finding
comfort in the unknown I would way
rather that than know everything and
have like a full structured outline
things mean as much as I put the power
into the meaning so then I looked at
life as this playground for me to just
run and have fun and be free and and
create my own path practice magics
really push it push the universe to like
make magic for me if I trust in the
universe and I test it and say like will
show me like the fun things show me and
I will trust in you and it's this
give-and-take thing that sounds really
weird but trusting myself I trust in my
path and it all just pans out but I just
take it day by day stress less enjoy
just have fun
it can be hard I only would say things
that I need to tell myself so it's
something you practice every day and
it's practicing gratitude and all of
that we are all very lucky and yeah I
don't even know what I'm going on about
felt like a proper video on purpose and
positivity and more stuff talking so
into you guys comment below what type of
talking videos you want to never really
know but I just wanted to talk about it
because even though my life seems like I
have it all sorted like every day is a
new beginning for me every day I'm not
really sure what I'm doing I just go
with the flow so I encourage you all to
do the same I'm sorry my camera just
died for a little bit um and I just
edited that whole part of me talking
what you just watch and it is a massive
ramble jumble of words I'm like
literally half asleep but it felt like I
had to say what I said for some reason
so hopefully it helped some of you or
maybe like had its own impact on some of
you and its own weird way I also just
want to say how incredible my past week
is me and everything that you've seen in
this vlog has just been so amazing it
was so much fun for me to go back to
Byron and just I always chill out there
I reconnect I get really grounded and
just like going to the beach with G and
just doing little things like that um
literally just helps my soul so much
because I think there's one side to my
job that you guys see which is the fun
time there's the other side that you
don't see which is a lot of stress that
comes with it and judgment upon myself
and my own mental battle of trying to
balance being a teenager well you know
having this full-time
full-on kind of job so doing those
things makes me really happy and I'm
sure through the videos you can see
literally how happy and just like at
peace I am I'm ready to just freefall
for a bit and just travel and have fun
and document it and yeah I've said all
this already in this video okay so I
just am repeating myself but yeah so I'm
gonna go chanting this video quickly
upload a few guys and then I'm gonna go
watch Moana because I've only ever seen
half of it I haven't finished it and I'm
like guys literally made a Disney
character like sure so yeah we'll see
