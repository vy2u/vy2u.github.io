probably know a lot of things that I
love and laugh going to the beach being
around friends but I know you know that
above all I literally live for music
festivals I know it's weird but there's
just something about being in a big room
people all listening to music it's like
one big crazy adrenaline rush it is
literally the best thing ever so today
I'm here to show you my daytime music
festival makeup and outfit look I'm
starting out by moisturizing my lips of
these adorable little macaroon lip balms
and they come in four different flavors
and I'm just taking my vanilla one which
is my favorite smells so good and I'm
just putting this all over my lips after
this I've gone ahead and applied my
favorite foundation some concealer and
I've also filled in my eyebrows after
this I'm just taking my factory contour
kit and I absolutely love this product
is my must-have because it comes with
six different contouring shades and it's
also perfect if you're a beginner
because it has some instructions on the
back of like how to contour then I'm
just taking this brown color down here
and I will be applying this contour
shade into the holes of my cheek and
also my forehead and what I also like to
do is I like to put it on my jaw line
just to define even more after i finish
contouring both sides of my face i'm
just taking the bronzer brush and i'm
blending all of this contract so there's
no harsh lines after I've done this I'm
taking this like banana shade in the
contour kit and I'm just applying this
under my eyes to brighten it all up and
pull the whole contour look together
together super beautiful and glowy
bronzed look I'm taking my factory
powder bronzer and that bronzer brush
and it's applying as to all of these
spots where we previously contoured the
next thing you want to do is add some
color onto your cheek so I'm just taking
this kind of like light rose pink color
from the contour kit and applying this
to the apples of my cheeks now it's time
to move on to the eyes i'm taking it to
of the really beautiful i shadow
palettes that factories come out with
now there's two different ones there is
one called California days which is
really cute daytime palette with like
lighter more neutral shades and then we
have on the bottom Vegas nights which is
perfect for nights out I'm starting out
of my Vegas nights eyeshadow palette and
my factory I show brush and taking the
very first color in the palette I just
really like this one because it works
perfectly for daytime and for nighttime
too then I'm going to be highlighting my
inner corner with this beautiful gold
color from the California days on pallet
personally for a festival I just like to
stick with putting on some really simple
and light brown eyeliner on my lower
lashline and upper lashline and also in
my waterline just for a little bit more
definition and kind of give like a
smoking look then to open up my eyes a
whole lot more I'm just taking the
factory mascara and applying this to my
upper and lower lashes this is all the
makeup done and then for the lips I'm
just blotting off that lip balm we had
on earlier and then flip stick factories
car with the six chunky crown lip
pencils that are really awesome and easy
to sit on your bag for a festival and
I've decided to go with this really
vibrant bright red lipstick to complete
my whole festival makeup look as a
finishing touch I'll be taking factories
body spray which all of these flavors
smell absolutely incredible there's four
different ones but i'll be using my
favorite one which is coconut crush of
course you guys know I love coconut and
I'm to spraying this all over my body
and this is perfect to do just before
you enter the festival see you smell
nice and sweet and fresh for my hair
I've just decided to keep it really
simple and just straighten it because i
just find it easiest this way but if you
want to do something a little different
or you prefer your hair up and other
good option is just to pull it up into a
messy ponytail and pull out the little
wispy bits at the front to add a little
bit more star little bit more volume so
for my festival outfit i'm just wearing
these super cute like denim overalls
with a really beautiful long sleeve lace
shirt and what I've also like to add to
this outfit is just like a brown leather
backpack I would a nice little straw hat
and I've also just added some vintage
Sonny's to this look so this is my final
festival look I hope you guys enjoyed
this video don't forget to
check out factories new beauty range and
make sure you have so much fun this
festival season to stay safe and look
after your friends and i'll see you guys
in my next video
we are coming and coming I like you too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
