drifted all gotten from an op shop so

and Josh you're gonna go get some lame
mainstream of clothing Hey look at this
okay um Jesus now we're gonna get some
lunch first and then go get it done and
I'll show you guys how I pick out op
shop stuff and style it up and then yeah
you know have some fun let's do it you
ready oh is Nalu Knollys nollies on this
street yummy yummy vegan food the truck
would love right
we are salvos in Bondi Junction got the
team
hey are you guys ready to do some
shopping
approved perfect for the festival season
please no not actually kidding oh my god
are you kidding wait seriously
this is like this is perfectly waiting
here for me okay oh my god mom you would
wear that
shaken not stirred
[Laughter]
GG's mine okay I'm really happy you
found this happen I'm even happy because
a plume it's really funny I can turned
it seriously like brown ones pink ones
you're gonna hate those in just tighter
at the waist and then you can wear them
baggy do this so-called okay well try
them all about the yellow some yellow
glasses like this could be this could be
invited for sure say you're up shot you
gotta just go through it faster green
see the green oh yeah that might be cool
with like a scarf chocolate something
yeah accessory Oh cute
everything what are you doing
oh are you going to put it in the tray
huh dude I love so much stupid I
like it can also carry this around my
way you could wear it as a cape that's
cute or a headpiece you know what have
you got there we're out of time
oh my god I can this is us at Langley
hmm maybe not that one it's maybe a
little bit too warm honey Gigi's just
found a really cool piece of February
give us your ideas and then cut them a
triangle
may it be on the valley a cool little
staff talk okay look add that to a
collection my best to recall shopping is
always just like grab a bunch of stuff
it's super cheap spend a little more and
then you can take your stuff home in
style but you can never really tell what
its gonna be like until you like maybe
cut some stuff or style it up definitely
like you've got to have an open mind
that's my best tip it's just lame I
realize that is the cosmos that is the
cosmos sending us a Mars me okay that's
coming that's coming home of course I've
got all my goodies in the bag I'm gonna
go get some lunch
it is festival day today and I'm just
going on to Bondi one of the hair songs
they were doing braids and stuff for the
festival this is literally the first
time in my life I've ever had my hair
braided like I don't know how I feel I
didn't even know if I'm in focus right
now like sorry if this is out of focus
everything is just
oh I'm rushing right now I have an out
quickly get ready I've been an hour to
style up all of my optional goodies I've
definitely settled on I mean playing
around off-camera
I'm definitely gonna wear the yellow
pants that I go I really wanted to wear
this hat but since I've got the braids
is gonna stick out when I put it on and
right now I'm either thinking of styling
it up with my bikini top that I already
have all this bra that I have so I'm
gonna try some things I'm gonna show you
guys what I come up with but the fun
thing about styling up thrifted clothes
is that you can just kind of go really
wacky and weird with it because like my
pants they were huge on me but I've got
that belt to kind of pull it in so they
look really cool I'm gonna quickly do my
makeup and then I'll keep you guys
posted once I come back in here and try
on some things and we can style it up
together
Gigi's just come over I found a top to
start my hands up with I've done my
makeup so excited Gigi's wearing my
design me Gigi's wearing my princess
polytope look how cute she looks
oh my god I just found a shirt a random
shed I had lying around my star belt I
had to UM the sharing front about
because the other belt was too big and
didn't hold up my pants I know I'm gonna
put on the jewels that I got from silver
so I got this really cute silver
bracelet and a little necklace and then
I really want to wear the hat but I just
don't
I think it's gonna work today that'll
get used on the back yeah
literally I'm gonna wear this in New
York</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
