that is gonna be like kind of daily
vlogging like every second or third
daily looking because I'm literally just
not on top of my life enough to love
every single day I don't want to commit
to promising and I'm gonna do that and
then literally fails so hey I'm gonna be
vlogging my day today at my date
tomorrow and then I'm floating it and
then I'm gonna be doing the same to the
next two days and then probably the next
two days I'm just gonna try it out for
this week I did have a vlog it's Tuesday
right now I did have a vlog from the
weekend and yesterday but it was just so
boring and I know you guys like to see
boring something it was just like beyond
boring so at least I'm doing something
fun today I'm about to go for a walk if
Lee and I have to go to the doctor
because don't know if you can see this
disgusting bubble thing on my eye but
from a film that the judge and I did out
of us too I was so clean with putting my
contacts to him watching my hands
everything and I was the one that ended
up getting some frickin infected eye and
his eyes are fun even though he's eye
contact I literally dropped on the floor
and stuff cuz I've had this like a week
now and I was hopefully thing he would
just go away but it hasn't and I'm a big
shoot next Monday and I don't want to
have this big donut in my eye I drink so
much water in a day this is 1.5 liters
and I drink three to four of these feels
good I think the more I've been drinking
water more often you actually crave it
more and it becomes easier to drink a
lot of water plus I've been working out
a lot more than my man I've been also
going to the infrared sauna which is
incredible which I might talk about
later when I go if I go today but it's
important to drink a lot of water
okay so I should actually never be
allowed in health food stores just spend
so long in there and I spent so much
money when I was honestly only going to
try and find like two products but I
just thought this apple cider vinegar
drink because I was watching Sonia
ezrin's video and she said this stuff is
really good like weight loss and skin
and just everything so I'm trying it out
it tastes kind of funky but it's good
and also I finally got my big rose
quartz back from Lee's house I left it
there ages ago and I felt like wrong
taking it away that's like she needed it
at that time but now I have it back this
is my favorite crystal ever actually
changed my life helped me sleep help me
attract love is amazing it's I'm going
home now cuz I have to get ready to
shoot I'm gonna do a mini hold I got
some maca powder probably it's really
good for energy I don't know I need to
learn more about it and I've always
wanted to try it my mom swears by this I
got some green tea at blueberry is slim
life I have a mess of tea collection I
just love
buying new ones and it also love detox
penalties but I'm so over my detox takes
I drink a lot a massive thing of cacao
powder because mine is almost out
honestly it just swear by cacao powder
in my coffee and it's just so good it
has a lot of magnesium in it so for like
post-workout
it's really good to help with any like
aching muscles and also it's a really
good mood booster it's just
cacao it's just amazing I got some apple
cider vinegar to try to like do shots of
it because people said that's apparently
good most cinnamon some strawberry
essence oil because the off you used to
have a strawberry essence oil that we
like just carried around with us at
Splenda and it's so sweet
it's like sickly sweet but if your
energy is down in your mood is a bit low
and you put a tiny bit of this on I'm
telling you it like lifts you up
instantly it's crazy and then I just got
you guys know I love my how to peanut
butter them try not the chocolate flavor
and I just got two big ponents and
strawberries with a little liberal
sherry these poison berries when I make
my protein smoothie bowls which
the most awkward thing of my life I had
literally can't talk this is just
getting extreme if you guys have me on
snapchat you would know that I've been
posting about The Chronicles of these
window repair guys been they pretty much
hang outside of my big windows I've got
big windows and my kitchen has these two
massive windows my living room has huge
windows there's no blinds and like
really tragically last week I walked out
into my living room naked because I
wasn't expecting guys to be there on
like abseiling down the building I'd be
more embarrassed in my life
I don't want to talk about it because it
gives me actual anxiety and cringe since
then every morning when I'm making
breakfast this one guy it just pops down
on a string and we always have this
awkward I just laugh right at his face
and he smells like him and then he just
sits there and like so just then I was
filling myself talking and he pops down
he looks at me I laugh and I'm just like
oh my god and that's when I Oakwood they
like got out of the kitchen so I was
like do I stay and like keep making my
oats or do I get the out late I
just need them to be done with this
construction because actually ruining my
life it freaks me out want my privacy
bag I want my life back
okay so I really quickly have to get
ready and do my makeup and shoot with
Josh and friend Byron amazing
photographer I'm just gonna put on some
makeup and then I'm contemplating
whether to clip in hair extensions or
not I literally just hate shooting when
I thought show her hair doesn't feel
like me even though it is me you know
it's gonna put on some makeup do it
I got Sentinel of benefits knew it
concealers and this is the airbrush
concealer I'm giving it I'm gonna try
out this other palette the Chloe Morello
pretty fun and feel it's pellet and I
had a whole bunch of makeup delivered to
me ages ago and I never tried it out I
just forgot about I went to LA but this
tell it how good these colors I love all
my brown shades so I'm gonna take this
one up here cold unconditional I love
this color it blends up so nicely as
well so shout out to benefit for their
they're real push-up liner I have gone
through about so many of these is the
only eyeliner I can use to do my winged
eyeliner now like I literally cannot use
any other gel liner or liquid liner like
this is my all-time Holy Grail and if
they ever stop stocking this I think
I've said this in another video before I
will actually cry and I need to go back
and get the brown eyeliner because I
still love alternating between doing
black and brown winged liner this is
just the best product in the world and
it stays on like for every single
festival I go to and I do a winged liner
like this stuff does not budge
I'm going to show you guys a bronze I've
been loving at the moment the hourglass
bronzer in diffused bronze light and I'm
just Oh what and you guys know I love to
be super bones is the makeup done very
fast I don't know if this is any good or
