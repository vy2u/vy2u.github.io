party girl I am a party go when I'm like
really in the mood of it but never I've
got like work stuff on all I can do is
focus on work and I get like so hardcore
into it especially when I'm focusing on
like my fitness and my well-being I hate
going out and drinking unnecessarily and
I'm just such a party pooper now when it
comes to events and going out like what
though but I mean it's good because I'm
it's good I'm really focusing and
committed to doing the vlogs and I'm
just committed to getting laughs and
tried and it wouldn't have like a big
night out and then wake up and Phil scat
I have a meeting with my managers at
9:30 in the morning and I'm proud of
myself
keeping on track like I just used to go
on potty unnecessarily when I just was
pointless and I'd wake up and be like
why did I do that Genevieve and I just
left the event early and when I got some
sushi now I'm just gonna wash my face
take off this makeup brush my teeth get
cozy it's so cold in Sydney tonight so
I'm just keen to get warm and maybe do
some editing before I go to sleep I was
chat you guys in the morning good
morning
blog so look I'm not trying to throw a
pity party or anything I just woke up I
was facing that way away from my big
window right hands which was Britt Lee
open I was checking my phone for like 20
minutes just you know scrolling I
realized that there's two big sets of
ropes hanging outside of my bedroom
windows pinch reading and freaking out
over the moment they start doing the
window construction on the bedroom area
so for this time this window I'm saying
if you look closely you can see a little
rope just dangling in the wind yeah so
that was open who knows who's been
watching me while I sleep this morning I
just I just am living life and feel I'm
so happy I great so I'm saying get me
out of my apartment building anyways
that's my updates for this morning I'm
gonna get up in a minute and get ready
get dressed go into the offices Georgia
stain by brushing my teeth which they
want most people that I can't do
anything in my day until my teeth
everyone comes to my apartment and I see
that I have all my like highs myself
laying around so does that actually work
because obviously like I'm a technical
blogger I did primer for eyes not yet
but the thing is tell my friends I'm
like I didn't collaborate with them
until I tasted the product and maybe yes
food this stuff the day and night
toothpaste I love it I've never been so
wet in my life oh shut up - hi smile and
just like confirming to you guys like I
actually do use this product I don't
just do promo for them like I smell if
you see this anymore like save me some
more stuff like feel free food this
running out I don't I don't really wash
my face in the morning I rarely watch my
face with a cleanser and I if I feel
like it needs a run some moisturizer so
my favorite one is the souk in hydrating
day cream with rose hip oil I'm obsessed
with anything
a rosy boil and it is my favorite and
this moisturizer it's just the best
every easiness for almost a year now
does the look today hobo chic just have
my big ducts on I got these from dolls
kill these leopard print pants that
definitely couldn't tell you where I got
these I had them did so long my shirt is
from princess fully my jacket is I am
dia the label I love this gonna come
warm and then to also have these cute
little earrings I'm just going in for
two meetings
I feel simply blessed to still be alive
right now I just had the the
 craziest uber driver it was
extreme he like sped up nearly drove
straight past me and was just zipping
around the streets and was just like I
literally got coughs a call sign for
what are you doing you're worse than me
driving so anyways just hit him with
love you guys I'm still alive I'm still
kicking I'm well give them see me back
there Hey
well what's up oh my god amazing I just
text my incredible hairdresser Dan at
why I'm salon I'm supposed to be going
to get my lashes done in Mossman and
then filming with Sammy but it's just I
have so much editing to do some collabs
coming up that I need to write some
briefs for and also I'm writing a new
little treatment for any little
something exciting and towards the end
of the year it's pretty much the project
I was supposed to do for Splenda but now
I'm doing it for something different so
we'll talk about that later
I need to get my hair extensions put
back in for the shoot and I'm supposed
to be doing it tomorrow morning but I
have a flight at 12:30 it would have
been really pushing it just can't afford
to miss this flight tomorrow so I just
text someone said and you by any chance
I'm so annoying like fit me in this
afternoon and he was like you're in luck
I've got a space at 4:30 so that is just
god bless you Dan saving the day
I'm gonna volunteer them hello oh yeah
that is the plans for today right now I
am literally so starving I'm gonna make
up a big bowl of veggies and quickly
start editing this vlog reply to my
emails I literally just have the biggest
to-do list in the world and I'm just
really upset that I won't be able to
fill my stomach when I get back from LA
I promise I mean I will do a club we
both have the busiest schedules that it
it's so hard to get a moment to just sit
and film to collapse but I promise we
will we'll do it once I'm back had the
briefing today for the shoot I'm doing
next week this shoot is for lieutenant
products that are coming out and it's
gonna be so fun I got the briefing
answers gonna be a really cool shoot and
I'm relieved it's not some bikini beach
shoot I was really nervous if it was
gonna be that because I just would feel
so insecure because I really don't model
much and I just would not be comfortable
in a bikini photo shooting with really
hot bikini models you know I love my
body I love I'm confident in and myself
but when it comes to taking photos and
photo shoots it's weird because I've
lost like almost 25 kilos you know so in
my mind you kind of get a bit of body
dysmorphia when you come from being so
much bigger and like adjusting to a new
body it's like you have old fears around
the way you would normally feel if that
makes sense and so yeah it's just I'm
adjusting but that's why I said yes to
this shoot I wanted to push myself to be
more confident within myself to do big
photo shoots like that so I'm just proud
of myself for saying yes and I am like
just obviously a little bit nervous
because I keep saying I'm not a
professional model like I don't really
know fully how to pose and like what to
do but it's gonna be fun it'll be good
my mom's actually gonna be in Sydney for
the shooters so she's gonna come along
and blow get for you guys for me back
myself and be confident like am i right
or am i right yes though okay I'm gonna
stop talking and go make some food wait
but this looks bad but let me just tell
you this is the best tasting thing I
have spinach tomato mg capsicum beans
Karen broccoli and avocado on top and
spinach underneath and nutritional yeast
on top yummy I'm just gonna start
editing this vlog seeing as today I
haven't that any time an older exercise
and I am I'm just gonna walk to my
hairdressers forget your daily activity
in super stylish super styling even
though it's so windy outside it looks
like it's about to start pouring that's
all good let's get moving
twelve seconds later really great the
minute I go to step outside of the door
it starts raining you should probably
just drive that's so annoying
have some me head finally getting some
fresh air because last time I was how
many times we put those other ones back
like I needed them in for like a tiny
bit of time so we didn't want to get new
hair so I had ratchet hair before but
now we are setting it up yes love my do
