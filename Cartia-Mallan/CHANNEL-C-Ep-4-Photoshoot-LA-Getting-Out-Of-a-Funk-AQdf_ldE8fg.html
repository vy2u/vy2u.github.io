your coffee was free yeah mine was
really good too it was just there all
over the floor SOS
I've just gone and gotten a whole lot of
groceries sucked up the fridge was just
lots of veggies comments berries
honestly I hate eating out all the time
so I've always needed buy my own
groceries always I go crazy so much
cheaper and much more fresh making food
I don't cook with olive oil and I find
when I eat out they put so much oil and
everything and it just makes me so save
I think I just don't like it okay I've
just been chilling out for a bit editing
and now I'm just getting ready to go out
for dinner and Benji and Deana and a
whole bunch of other people I think
Sophie's coming too so I'm just getting
ready brother
seriously it's story time like I'm still
jet-lagged I just don't even know how
that's possible but hi Benji tries to
act like he doesn't want to be a part of
the vlog hey so I just woke up and I
woke up feeling it like zoned and just a
bit of a heavy feeling it's like not a
sad feeling I just say more heavy and
it's like it always happens for no
reason and it just kind of comes out of
nowhere and I feel like you know my
always happens to me in the first week
when I'm in LA or I go to a different
country and it just it's like adjusting
and I thought I just put so much
pressure on myself to always be doing so
much all the time and whenever I just
need to slow down I find I get a lot of
like internal conflict and stress which
I need really need to work through so my
plan is just shift myself from this mood
isn't gonna make over breakfast meditate
reply to my emails clipping putting that
off write down a big to-do list of stuff
I want to do update you guys my like I
know I'm a very positive person
I'm super happy all the time like but I
do have moments where I feel this
uneasiness and like this heavy feeling
but it normally does go away really
quick when I take action instead of
wallowing it instead of being like I
feel shitty this morning we have a bad
day I'm like no this gives me an
opportunity to improve something and I
might learn something and normally in
the moments where you feel a bit more
down you reflect and so I might help me
find something that I didn't know what's
going on so that's what I'm doing and go
smile and I already feel bit up also
exciting I think I'm gonna go buy a new
camera today I'm gonna get the one that
yes he has it's just really nice okay so
just got and ready gonna be the last day
I've loved and I'm gonna make a new one
that's actually on track with everything
I'm doing you look very pale in this
light but pretty much I was getting
dressed I'm wearing this cute denim
dress from blue stroll mom and I are
just about to go and check mom and Tony
air B&amp;amp;B and then I'm gonna go finding
camera store and I'm gonna buy a new
camera then it's really good because I
can film high quality stuff and also
take really good photos with it I don't
know what it's cool but it's a bluemix
brand I think I'm not sure so that's
what we're doing I'm gonna get some
lunch and let's go to my favorite little
place in LA it's called the spring so
it's in downtown and it's like a yoga
studio and cafe and mums doing research
because she's planning a little pump
can't talk about it too much but yeah I
thought I'd bring it here and give us a
mince pie I'm excited it's so good
okay I've just gone back to little place
just like in San Diego that booty so I'm
gonna show you guys my new camera right
sliding I said didn't ever think I'd go
and buy a loo mix pretty random but it's
a Lumix G 7 and I just love it because
it's really really nice for filming so
this is my body of it it takes really
beautiful photos I wanted to get it was
because we hammer I have right now I was
like good for powering around and taking
to festivals and just fitting in my
handbag but it doesn't take very good
photos and filming quality isn't that
incredible it's just average so I wanted
to step it up a little and I shoot so
many photos as well so I thought it'd be
good to have something for both I also
got a new little Polaroid release giving
me the update in the mystic Medusa book
Bible it's literally a Bible shout out
to mystic my friend Jean she's amazing
okay some of my new camera just thought
I'd give a little family dinner going on
