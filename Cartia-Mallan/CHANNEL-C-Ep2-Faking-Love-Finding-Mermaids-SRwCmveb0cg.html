that I'm deciding that I want to do dan
I was like we are a hundred don't shave

kind of big thing that I'm pretty sure
it's gonna you'll be able to figure it
out

baby boy down I went so slow it's like
literally the shoe that I've been
dreaming up for ages and we're just
walking like he was like the perfect
match to do it with just to clear it up
I think I've got to say I got really I
think up t7n is um into a different sort
of gender gender honey has gone up the
market a boyfriend the most beautiful
part they are so good together
and this is why Jane was closer to the
sheet there was no sexual awkwardness
