with I really cold up and coming artist
code Youngblood we gonna talk about
I'm a chat today telling some very cool
stuff music here to talk about impact
you're making right now and about your
views on staff so maybe run me through
your process so far before you see it
with what you're doing with where you
want to go yeah it's been pretty kind of
it's been pretty mark yeah it's been
pretty like it's just been amazing like
to just like it's back been it been a
year ago since about King Charles the
first rap just with no management and to
be like a yoga Jerry what do you reckon
it is that's like I don't know what what
it is for me my what's the sick thing
for me is that the connection with
people yeah so early
like what crazy is that my Instagram
that's where I'm at the Amin's like
every day people text me and say like
I'm really relating to music divide me
with answers it's making me I feel I can
speak ugly because it's about stuff - I
mean it's about things that it's real I
feel like with with you or me you thing
like when I first looked up your stuff
and listened to polygraph I was like the
first night listen to it and you guys
should check that out it's amazing but I
really listened to the lyrics so and I
got the email value I looked you up and
the night before that I had this massive
conversations my girlfriends we were
talking about like are you can growing
up and being like taking advantage of
when we were young we didn't realize how
 up that was and we should split
oh no it's fine like you know and we
were like raging all three of us like
it's dude no man get it like we
love man like we don't want to hate men
like and like I always used to say like
oh so I come out of my channels like
stalk about you know equality feminism
like women's rights it comes it's meant
to like you guys go have a voice
and I think I could iro it Johnny and I
think it excites me because I was like
that but I was going on and off when I
was really young I don't see that I'd
see it happening but the fundamental
crazy thing was that it didn't resonate
how wrong yeah and that was what I
needed to write about and yeah man it
was just and then a that's what I'm
always want to be in for me when I want
to talk about real things I just think
this apps have been lost very much do
you feel like though say itself in your
friendship group like how was it for you
though like moving away from that it's
like I know growing up like having a
voice and like not fitting in like
having your own what style and like
you're you're looking loud and out there
yeah Shona make an impact like it's hard
because there's so much social
conformity it's like how do you reckon
and like what would you say to people in
their own world like how do you
what's yourself think it's kind of
finding like just being fundamentally
yourself yeah I know it sounds easy but
it I mean it's an actual investment to
me then is an investment to make and I
think like accept yourself for who you
are because and say what you think
journey with my music I don't want to
tell people what to think because doing
the hell I might do that that's why I
think it's probably had such an impact
on people when you're raw and like open
and they can connect with that but you
know yeah I'm not joking humans like
Christine know exactly nuts it really
it's like I never want to be in a child
eyes yeah I mean there's no I never want
to do a show get about and then be
driven on I don't want to do that part
of the whole whole thing for me is
connecting with people on a human level
because that's why I did it because
finally I write these songs cuz I'm
angry oh yes want to talk about yeah and
if we say what we think that's how we
talk line that's how it changes Charlie
totally and it's just it's been like
it's just blow my mind to see the
reaction yeah off dice I won everything
what's great is that like music I feel
to me that's right oh my inspiration
it's most like powerful thing it get
stuck in people's heads people like your
emotions are linked oh and that's why I
think like moving like honest moving
chord and that's why I reckon like your
 school and why people probably do
connect is because you are like making
you're creating a movement 300 they're
much do you reckon moving forward more
artists and doing that well like do you
ever like say what's on your keys and
friends like like I sound like I think
to know something I think there are
things happening well that's what that's
what it that's why I start talking about
it stuff in music because I think
there's been a bit it's been a bit like
lost month there's no like message
anymore I mean it's just I
bitch get down oh yeah I'm Cara moanings
oh I love you so much I'm gonna share my
pops yeah sorry I just can't anymore
known even frustrated and thanks
frustrating and inside its come a
distinct line that's once when it
represents more than music that's why I
love hip-hop so that's right now because
it's giving me the same feeling like the
clash in the Arctic Monkeys yeah totally
John Eynon
that's what we said on something as are
like Arctic Monkeys
oh yeah man look like I grew up on in my
life
oh I like to turn us wanted like return
I like see remember now yes going by
they were the only two people go inside
my head yeah yeah it's doing they're
doing exactly in the fundamental that's
why the bar is like Lord as a knowledge
you gotta push boundaries to move
together like to move towards a bad
thing for me that's that's what my
opinion what is this P not out there to
try and change something or if you know
that's try making I mean you know how
you're saying that you've got influences
around you trying to be like do this you
know what Paul you've actually wanted
these legs better greatly so amazing
like my team with just guys are so
amazed about my team the other side yeah
and it's just like it's so easy to come
so I moved out a little bit at 16 and
I've got a management team and they were
just thought yeah how do this do this do
this do this
float your eyes and look pretty for the
girls man and then but that was become
that become a you lose your soul
in it dude ladies are fine I mean it's
acting it's just a tan a moment by the
team are just so amazing I decide yeah
do it you're welcome

I love it I don't know why I think it's
your side it's a friendlier England

sunshine that's the Sun and everyone I
feel like people at least for me and my
demographic because like online I think
that's unlike you on my iron why do i
why am i doing this was something making
impact some oh but I think people
they're like pick up to it so much my
family talk let's talk like get into it
and I feel like they are pushing about
this and what do you want to like try
and inspire what's on your mind right
now in terms like what issues you care
about oh that's it must feel like so
there is an album yes because of
corporate boat
literally about so many issues of young
oppression and problems all around I'm
just like it's so refreshing because
it's like my one frustration like I
literally was sitting talk to her with
so much feeling yeah and it's like
musics more powerful it's so powerful
and that's the exciting thing about it
that's that's really true and I'm just
so excited to release you talk about so
much matter so like what are you touch
on like I taught you like gone well you
