have no idea how good it feels to
finally just be able to sit down and
have a one-on-one chat with you guys
I've been all over the place in Sydney
and environ and you've seen on the vlogs
there has been so many questions being
thrown around the place like about
Splenda and about just live and just
about stuff it sounds like you know
what's the best thing I could possibly
do is sit down and film a
question/answer video for you guys
excuse my voice and my coughing and my
like really read north club environment
oh so much I'm so sick I've been sick
for like the past five days they're
really bad cold and it's just not fun at
all I never normally get sick and I'm
second anyways
yesterday I posted a photo on Instagram
just saying ask me some questions about
Splenda about my videos about anything
and I will answer them before I go into
the questions let's try two about
Splenda first off if you don't know its
splendor is and you kind of just here
for the Q&amp;amp;A I'll quickly run you through
it's just like kind of like one of
Australia's biggest music festivals I
guess you could say one of the best by
far and it's just a great time everyone
goes you know just splendor where are
you I don't know today it is Thursday
next week on Wednesday I will be heading
down to Byron with a bigger of my
friends and we're gonna be setting up a
campsite setting up my tepee in the
campgrounds on Wednesday and then we
have like Thursday free and then Friday
Center and Sunday I will be at Splenda
for the full three days some people have
been asking are you doing a
meet-and-greet or made up at Splenda I'm
really sorry to say I'm not I don't
really feel like it's necessary to do it
at Splenda it's a little too crazy too
busy yeah I just think it's more organic
if I meet you while I'm in the March or
like you know walking through getting
food or something you can see me don't
be shy to come and say hello I'll be
there with ya its and easy and all my
friends you'll see us all there and go
have a little bit of dance and mush and
have a good time take some photos and
stop I'm so excited you have no idea we
were just talking about it the other day
like I swear to God week one I tickets
open like a million years ago and now
next week what another question that
everyone's been asking is what are you
wearing to slender can you tell us what
sort of outfits you're wearing and
whatnot I am just going to be keeping
this little bit a secret my slender
outfit prep has been going on for a few
I don't know like a month two months
I've been thinking about it for a while
I've been planning it getting all my
outfits together but you guys will see
I'll be posting plenty of photos but I
am very excited because a lot of prep
has gone into the outfits I'm kind of
like what I want wanting for them I
don't know how they're actually gonna
turn out because normally festivals I
end up getting like a crazy idea to just
throw this stuff but I'm like cool we'll
go with that so who knows but a little
hint is all three of the outfits are
very different styles that's my head
one of my best tips if you all plan it
if you're going to splendor and you're
freaking out about the prep and like
you're camping and stuff my best piece
of advice for you would be get like one
big piece of paper and write a massive
list everything you could possibly think
of it you want to take with you write it
down draw a little box next to it and
just slowly start making a pile in your
room and just take everything off as you
go so that you make sure you don't
forget anything that's all I have to say
about slender I'm so excited to
hopefully meet a lot of you guys they
are I think best meeting people at
festivals is the best place that's why I
love meeting my subscribers and like
Instagram fellows because I'm in my
element like I'm having fun you guys are
having fun and it's cool because we can
dance together and we can take photos
and hang out and it's just a fun fun
environment festivals are my favorite
I'm Owen also everyone's been asking am
i filming slender yeah I have a really
cool video that I've got in mind and I
hope it works out it's gonna be lengthy
but totally going to be a cool video if
it was if it works
that being the emphasis on my friends
bringing cameras
and it's up to you guys all so many
questions where do I even start
I don't know okay this is a corn to
start with um how do you live life to
the fullest advice and tips please okay
I get this question so much I guess a
lot of you guys obviously see that I'm
kind of at about all the time like I'm
always traveling and was at the beach
I'm always doing something with my time
and this is simply because I would go
crazy if I didn't do something like I
mean I got so much work that I'm
constantly doing and everything and the
only way for me to stay sane and keep my
mind positive and healthy as if I
actually go on trips places and I'm
doing something and experiencing things
I think the best way to live life to the
fullest is realizing that even though
you may be busy there's always time you
always have time it's just about how you
kind of allocate time and what you
prioritize because you can always make
time to stuff but my tips to kind of
getting there is just realizing that you
have the right to be able to do it and
you have the right to be able to live
your life as extravagant as fun as you
want it to be and even though it may
seem hard and your head like to do this
stuff and to go out in the lab it's
really not you just have to try and
align yourself with some good people
just be spontaneous like hey let's go on
a hike in a mountain off let's book a
holiday the next holidays and like save
up now so we can do it or set goals and
like you know to have drive to want to
do it because it can be done and I think
to live life to the fullest you have to
have a positive outlook and even if
things like kind of screw up the first
time
don't let that like affect the next time
still keep going you push her and you
learn from the mistakes each time but a
bing bada boom don't know what's going
on my hey I'm going crazy I believe okay
it's top dances answer the questions
okay the second question is what are
your goals for next year I'm a lot of
girls next year
a little bit overwhelming in my head cuz
I have them all planned I'm like Katya
how are you going to execute all of this
somehow to be done but career-wise my
goals get more into like the profession
film music kind of industry that is
pretty much where my passions lie like
that's the stuff that gets me like
makeup was my thing for a little while
but as I've kind of grown I've really
had this like like found this love for
fashion and yeah music as I just said I
just looks a little bit and filmmaking
yes so my goal is definitely to try and
maybe next year like collab with more
filmmakers or more fashion people and
different artists and bands to try and
collaborate stuff like I'm a really
creative thinker and person I can go to
a creative school and art school and I
know I'm always kind of thinking of
different ideas for stuff so I want to
start being able to you know execute
that with different brands and doing all
sorts of fun things when I keep doing
what I'm doing now like I love it I want
to travel a lot next year I want to just
sort of like lay out my cards and see
what I can do and like just plan I guess
and just have fun next year is going to
be awesome like I have it all set in my
mind I just want to have the best time
with some friends meet new friends meet
new people and just collaborate
collaborate create collaborate
so yeah next year's gonna be awesome
kind of wish it would come around
already like I'm ready to do it I'm
ready to go okay I'm just getting really
rowdy the upcoming projects you're
looking forward to yes there is a few
upcoming projects that I'm really
excited for I'm not really sure if I'm
allowed to disclose exactly what they
are but they have to do with music and I
have to do with some modeling which is a
little bit weird because it I didn't
like to muddle very much I used to be
absolutely horrified of modeling like
I'm not gonna lie i if anyone was like
you should be a model or anything I'd be
like no way just because I don't my body
type is not stick-thin I'm not really
torn quiet short medium high with curve
you know I got some meat on the bone so
I never really thought I was actually
eligible to model and a normally I get a
little camera-shy when I'd be in front
of a lot of people but ever since I
started doing some modeling shoots for
princess Polly and some other ones
before that I just liked it that boosted
my confidence a lot and I actually think
that through if I'm getting involved in
moline kind of promoting my body shape
it might actually help some other young
people pan someone just ask I guess
blender outfits more boy oh come on
here's the Papa now oh girl yes blender
outfits more edgy or boho no I wasn't
gonna say much about my slender outfits
because it is a bit of it like secret
but I will say they're probably not what
you would expect from good old carding
mal I've tried to push myself a little
bit in out of my comfort zone from just
having a boho style and they are in fact
a little bit more edgy than just boho so
get excited for that I yeah I tried
we'll see how they turn them since you
have such a unique strategy sometimes
worry about people being judgmental or
what they or what they think if you love
you by the way just struggling to be my
own person at the moment
you know like to be honest when my style
was changing more into what I wanted to
wear and not just dressing with all this
makeup on my face and I think I was just
dressing to try and fit into the mole
that I thought was acceptable once I
moved on from that and I really actually
expressed like what was going inside
through the way that I dress it's a
little bit scary at first and I didn't I
sometimes like I put an outfit I would
look so cool I bet this is such a cool
outfit and I'd be really in my stone and
I would take it off right take some pots
off because I was like not people like
don't dress like this so I'll get stared
at or I'll get judged and I I was really
anxious to do it at first but now
honestly you could probably see me
starting down the street in anything
I've kind of come to a point where I've
been like I honestly don't care what
other people think at first it can be a
little bit scary but eventually you'll
feel so much more confident in what
you're wearing because you know it's
coming from you not just what you think
you should be wearing finding hopefully
that made sense but I encourage you just
to push yourself to really wear what you
want to wear I know I know I'm not
muscaria but it's totally worth it and
then as you start to get into your style
it just develops and it changes and it
molds and develops with you as you grow
and it's really fun I'm literally ready
through there's 20 million questions
about any boys in your life what's the
boys in your life at the moment you have
any boys in your life at the moment I'm
sorry
sorry to break it to you guys I'm really
I really am sorry I wish in this video I
could report back and be like yeah you
know my boyfriend's going really well
which is doin ELISA Richards but no no
I'm really sorry to say there are no
boys in my life at the moment
females hit in the solo row at the
moment it's really just been about
focusing on myself
and getting some work done and just not
going down so that hasn't really been
time for it and not saying that I don't
want it pretty easygoing with all that
stuff so if if it happens it happens we
shall see what maybe happens it's
blinnder who knows lots of beautiful
boys at festivals
you never know what might happen if you
were to dye your hair a different color
what color would it be I was actually
just talking about this other day with
one of my friends one of my friends I'm
fine she dyed her hair like platinum
platinum blonde like white and it looks
so awesome she looks like Lily Rose
death yeah if I was to dye my hair a
different color
I would so do it platinum blonde like
hers it looks so awesome with like the
dark brows and it's very daring it
probably ruined my hair but I would
definitely do it that color it looks so
cool okay the next session are you or
would you ever become vegan I'm not
vegan but often I do think I want to try
it isn't I always talk about like we
didn't even come me again like let's do
it let's just do it but it seems really
hard like I don't know cuz my mom
wouldn't do it as well so I live in her
house so like we eat pretty much the
same food I think once I move out of
home I'd probably try and do it then but
lately I have been trying to cut out
roommate this way like I mean any maid
I've just been eating like fish and
mainly vegetables just because I don't
know I wanted to give it a go and I was
feeling a little bit like sluggish and I
just wasn't craving meat so I just tried
that so I probably not eat meat until
Splenda and then it's slender I'll be
like don't they look so good there's all
the bending stools and stuff I'll try
I'll see if I can I don't know pretty
crazy about it like I'm not really that
fast for you what's one actress super
excited to say it's a it's blend up
system displacement there are so many
artists and I'm ridiculously excited to
see because did it line up this year's a
little different like there's lots lots
more like small bands really great bands
oh um so many bands I absolutely adore
so I'm so excited about this year's
lineup but as basic as it may seem the
one band I'm so excited to say because
I've never seen them live and I
absolutely love their music but I'm
definitely really keen to see Tam and
Paula
they have such an incredible like
psychedelic rock Sam
their musics great just alone like loud
and the speaker in the college jamming
to it but Eric can live with a group you
know friends'll been just like oh my god
it's gonna be insane I'm so excited when
is your rainbow house video coming
and will it be like sing about brains
yes so this is so exciting I'm really
happy you guys are getting on board with
this you may have seen my video else is
sort of talking about how my video style
I'm gonna be uploading like some film
video type things I made a video when we
went to rainbow house you would have
seen my Instagram photos filmed that
weekend and I got so much food quite
quirky and really strange it's not
exactly like city but brain it's a lot
more raw like being real it's pretty
much just no filter in it it's not
filtered it all really actually a little
not really I've been working on that and
I want to try and have that finished and
edited fully the force blender it's
quite a long video and I like to start
with in the end I kind of started
running out of footage so it's not it's
nothing it's not a big work of art it's
nothing that great but it's still pretty
cool and I know quite a few really
excited to see that so we'll try and get
up as soon as possible
one see as opposed to make sure you do
give me some feedback if you like it or
what you think of it because it's super
exciting for me because as I said they
are my favorite type of videos to film
and to make because I don't really even
have to try and film them because I just
film exactly what I say and what I'm
experiencing and yeah so I think that's
all I have to say thank you so much for
