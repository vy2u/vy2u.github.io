i'm going to be doing just like a really
casual chitchat get ready with me video
I pretty much just woke up and I don't
really know how I'm doing today I think
I might film some videos but I just
thought it might be nice to like sit
down and have a chat with you guys while
I get ready because I started to talk
about and like to catch up on so I just
thought this would just be a good idea
got pretty burnt at the beach yesterday
but now it's kind of turning into tan
but that's why I'm a little bit a little
bit bright red so I bad last night I
slept in my earrings and still that's
why I started with my rings and I woke
up this morning my fingers like all numb
don't do that it's not fun I'll probably
regret putting my hair like just Chucky
and I like this and not probably doing
it because it's a total mess it hasn't
been washed into the beach it's like all
salty and dirty but it's okay god I
don't even know where to start
I'm like getting staged rather hard to
do my makeup which is so weird so yeah
that's just really in a way I'm using my
makeup primer Foundation and I have no
idea if it's going to match my face
because I don't have fake tan on and
this normally matches with my fake tan
so let's just see how we go yeah that
much as well the strangest thing ever I
miss being able to just sit down and
chat with you guys um so yeah as you saw
my last video was on when I was in
Sydney doing um the little black
masterclass um featured fan fest that
was so much fun I love being able to do
little things of that and I was just
really blown away by how lovely and just
easy to speak to an approach um Carissa
was a little bit nervous because some
bigger youtubers normally really kind of
just not talking about like anyone in
particular but like some of them just
kind of seemed like they'd be really
stuck-up and just not have the time of
day to chat but she's lovely and just so
nicely I'd like the same view on I guess
so we're talking about in particular the
um like the australian youtuber
community and like when you compare it
to like the american wands and like the
especially like the british ones that
all that's a little family they've got
like a group of them that all friends
like there's one that you know the other
one from and they all like help each
other out it's so weird like cuz in
australia i feel like i mean i've got
some really lovely youtuber friends but
i feel like we don't ever all really
come together like as one to ever really
help each other out or to form that kind
of bond like it's like everyone's kind
of all for themselves i guess in a way
and like that's not not naming any
specific youtubers or even like
directing in a specific youtube it's
just all of us in general like i'm the
same but i guess I sort of I want to I
don't know form like a family type feel
of like the Australian youtubers like
and it'll get there eventually I pray I
hope that we all kind of like come
together as like some sort of like
friendship group family type thing
because we're like one-of-a-kind types
like there's not very many youtubers in
Australia and I just think I know I
think it'd be nice for that to happen
paying for myself I'm definitely going
to try and make more of an effort to
like do collaborations with other
youtubers that are around me I'm sure
you guys would also probably like to see
that I know everyone loves when I do a
collab videos like when Ronnie comes up
and we do videos together or when me and
Danny DeVito's together type thing yeah
I just think it'd be not it's like why
the Frick not I mean I don't know not to
say next I'm gonna try I get really shy
talking about this stuff I'm just scared
that like like I don't want anyone to
think I'm throwing shade at any other
youtubers which I'm so not I love all
the youtubers up I know and that are
around in the same area in Australia and
Sydney and the coast and Melbourne yeah
I just think we lack that community
family feel between each other let's try
and do something about it how that has
to do with Chris oh but that's what we
were chatting about we both kind of
agreed on that thing that it's not
really like that yeah I just don't I
swear to God I just like ramble on I
don't know if any of that just made
sense oh well let's move on so what else
oh so much exciting stuff coming up that
I have planned I just want to tell you
guys okay so you obviously all know that
I was like a hundred percent being like
yes I'm moving to Sydney in December
once I finish school I'm straight there
and I was doing that up until a few
weeks ago when I decided
I'm moving to Byron Bay I don't know
weird right I have like a six month plan
at the moment um and what that is is
that in December once I finished school
during school is Gold Coast I'm going to
volley with some friends so we're gonna
go to Bali for a week in like the first
week of December we'll be there and I'm
so excited for that minute I come home
from Bali and I will be straight on to
finding a house to rent me and Izzy and
her boyfriend Tom and my friend Henry
who already lives on a barn we've kind
of decided they were going to move into
your lab because I was thinking I go to
Byron and nearly every single weekend I
drive two hours from Brisbane every
single time to go down there and I stay
and I just I freaking love it like I
actually love being young I feel like I
just got this like attachment to the
place I want to move there and just live
there for like the summer time um so
yeah I will be in Byron from December
until March so months
I'm just for the summer time like it's
kind of like it sounds so lame and not
to be like I'm going there to find
myself I think I'm going there as to
have a break after having like 12 years
of being in school I'm going there to
work on myself and my content and what I
want it to be because it's one place in
all of anyway that I feel most at ease
and there's so many creative people that
inspire me and there's such beautiful
landscapes and I just think I don't want
to rush into just moving to Sydney when
I have time like oh now I've realised
all my life I rush rush rush like got to
do this now go to so i'm really harsh on
myself in that way so i was like how do
like take some time out for yourself and
don't for you guys as well i can have a
few months time to just make videos you
know and new content and find new ways
to explore myself and how I can outlet
that into my videos working more on my
creative side of videos so my film type
videos which you guys love and
love that you guys love them because I
want to make more of them perfect timing
falls festival is um environment new
year so I've got my tickets for that
I'll be there for the three days one of
my like main goals I'm down there is to
really just work on my health again and
getting fit again because I lost a lot
of weight last year and I was really
into all my fitness stuff and I love
fitness
I love eating healthy I love exercising
but since it's been great twelve and
I've been in school and life has been so
freakin busy I've just kind of let
everything slip and I'm starting to feel
really sluggish and not as healthy as I
could be for a while now have been
wanting to go vegan I've been wanting to
at least give it a try see if I like it
and I know I would probably love it I
think it's more doable there - there's
more vegan cafes more vegetarian options
and all of that good stuff
and um yeah so just not going down on
exercising eating healthy um having fun
and developing my content it's going to
be a blast and I'm like really happy
that you guys are going to be there for
every step of it I will be walking out
with filming and making videos every
week so yes you guys will see how that
all pans out
we don't know what happening and we
don't know what we're gonna do over
there is he has a job in Brisbane so
she's gonna have to drive back and forth
until she gets a job and Byron Tom's
from Wollongong so he's moving from
Sydney all the way to Byron so
everyone's kind of like we're all just
we all have no idea what's going on but
I think it's just we're young and that's
what you can do like we have that time
to just figure it all out as we go so
then once I get back from Byron in March
and my life's who knows where it'll be
at that point
well I booked a ticket to New York and
it's a one-way ticket yeah weird I know
what made me do that in the first two
weeks that I'm going there mum will be
with me for the first two weeks and I'm
just kind of I have some meetings over
there um just about developing my
YouTube channel and I'm some photography
stuff and maybe some modeling stuff and
pretty much just a whole bunch of random
stuff and after the meetings are all
done my mum flies home
and I'm just I don't know album it I
might be in New York I'm up in LA but
wherever I am I'm just going to wing it
um I have no plans at all I have a few
friends like I have a few people that I
know that live in LA while I'm there too
I think I'll be like continuing to make
youtube videos just doing like a diary
of what I get up to over there and I
mean if you're a blogger or um anything
you can recommend anything for me while
I'm in America I hope to be able to go
to Coachella whelmed there I really want
to do that I have travel bugs so bad so
I'll be all over the place kind of aim
to be in America for no longer than
three months max because I do really
want to get back and finally pack up
everything and move to Sydney and get my
life kind of happening they are that's
what I have that's my six-month plan I'm
so excited I really can't wait I just I
think me as well a goal that I had for
myself and one of the reasons why I
really just want to go to America and be
alone or not really have any plan to go
with someone is because I think at times
I have problems with putting myself out
there by myself I rely on having like
friends around me I'm a very social
person and I think I do have
independence but then again I get so shy
when I'm sometimes by myself in
situations and I just kind of rely on
having like the comfort of having
someone else around to make it okay
so I told me I really need to work for
myself and I think I'll be fine like I
am getting better with doing all of that
stuff and it'll just be awesome thing I
have like two more weeks of holidays to
go and take it for yours and ours the
music festival in Wollongong in two
weeks time on the Saturday really good
fun um the bands playing I'm so excited
to see them and freaking love cloud
control and they're playing that I can
saw them live I guess Angeles Jon last
year and that was really good and I came
to see them again and Delta rigs and um
the Reubens I can't wait to see the
ribbons again the ribbons were awesome
it's one like my favorite highlighter
sweater taking my new bedazzled
they're real mascara which I got from
the benefit like masterclass it's really
pretty packaging and this is my favorite
mascara ever such a gross rainy day
today it's so annoying like lucky eh
I've been at the beach for the past
three days so lucky I got in some beach
time before the rain came because now
it's just so miserable and grocers hate
hate hate the rain oh no me mm-hmm
also I want to touch on more of a
serious topic you guys may have seen
like a photo of me that I uploaded like
a few weeks ago when it's me and Izzy in
it we're like like touching tongues
saucy I got a lot of different responses
on that photo
some people like on my goal back is
caught areolas being like I said got
she's lesbian like blah blah blah I got
so many questions off if I was a lesbian
if I was dating is he if I was dating
yard loved like the girlfriend tag and I
think a lot of people have started to
think nook so don't post as many photos
with guys that I'm a lesbian just want
to clear it up real quick no shade no
nothing I'm not a lesbian I am 100 100%
straight I just have no problem
whatsoever with showing affection in
that way towards my friends I don't mean
as anything wrong with it there's
seriously nothing wrong with two people
of the same sex kissing touching tongs
hugging doing anything in that way the
people will like being like oh my gosh
she's a lesbian in a bad way but I think
there's some offset from it as well
that came after I uploaded the
girlfriend tag video so it's like the
best friend tag video with yes how's
this one comment on the video that
really really made me mad very much a
girl had commented saying cuz in the
girlfriend hey girls like I'm not eating
as I'm not a lesbian I'm just I just
love her to bits and this was more
fitting she was a via and she said I'm
so happy you're not gay I'm sick of
people coming out as gay the message it
wasn't exactly like quite that but it
was kind of something along the lines of
that and I looked at that and I just
thought like my face was just like
take a step back girl like it's a stupid
comment it was like I said in Thomas
comment I was like how dumb can you be
not to be rude but it really makes me
like quite fired up and so I just want
to quickly talk on this topic this is
the thing I just want to quickly say
people don't just one day wake up and be
like hey and I'm gonna be gay today I
want to like girls today I want like
boys today like let's just let's just do
that no doesn't work like that and if it
yeah I never notice I get really I get
really mad about this this is like my
one thing that I'm just like it's not
acceptable there's know for a fact that
I'm really like this means a lot to me
because a lot of my friends are gay I
freaking love them to bits and I hate
seeing people ever say anything rude to
them so therefore I stand up for the
full gay community and everything so
just to have that comment people haven't
just started coming out as gay because
it's a trend or it's like a fun thing
like I'm different if I'm gay no it's
simply because it's now thank freakin
God starting to become a little bit more
accepted came out it's becoming legal in
a lot of different countries now I think
people are kind of opening up to it a
little bit more not fully like it but
probably still there's still so much
bullying about being gay there's still
all the problems but it's becoming a
little bit more accepted that's all it
is it's not the people have noticed
decided like yeah I'm going to be gay
gay shaming is so not allowed it is not
accepted if you ever want to say
anything like that on my channel don't
get off like now because it's just it's
so negative it's so disrespectful it's
just like saying racist comments it's
not it when is it ever cool it's never
cool nothing along the lines that has
ever ever okay I had so many stories of
all my friends as I've been growing up
you know not being able to be who they
are not being able to be with someone
that they love you know it's love is
love
someone told me you're not allowed to
like a boy you never last birth a boy
anymore you have to just date girls from
now on that you like imagine that and
just be like well what do you mean like
I don't I don't like girls that way like
you fell in love with someone and they
someone just comes along says no no no
sorry you can't love them like you know
it's just heartbreaking stuff like it's
not just a little bit of a brush of a
kind of topic the more we can start
spreading positivity about gay rights
and gay
marriage and gay acceptance and just not
making dumb comments and not making dumb
jokes about this little stuff it's going
to progress even more in half signing
that we're at the forefront of this like
change in society that it's becoming
kind of more accepted now I don't really
know what else to say about it but um
yeah I just believe that you can
first and foremost kiss whoever the
Frick you wanna kiss do it what it like
it doesn't even freakin matter and if
someone wants to kiss their girlfriend
the song wants to kiss their like
girlfriend isn't like best friend or a
boy wants to kiss the guy friend or give
them a hug not a faggot for doing that
they're not gay for doing now just
spread some love there's no reason why
they can't you kind of get where I'm
going out with that so yeah let's just
be nice to one another please normal
comments like that on my channel please
otherwise I'll get really freaked them
out I will probably have to make a full
video about it and then for my lips I'm
just gonna be boring again and put on my
jean supreme lipstick in the colour bear
again it's just like a really nice nude
glossy color so that's kind of what the
makeup looks like just really glowy like
me type makeup look to do I'm gonna
change out of this shirt and do my hair
so this is everything for the video
thank you guys so much for watching
