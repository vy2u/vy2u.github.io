something done ahead bought two million
cups
hey everyone I'm card in Milan and today
I'm here my good buddy Chloe and today
we're gonna do a chit chat get ready
with us yeah so Chloe and I are going to
the Rufus key tonight we just actually
got back a little bit before I did an
interview with them and they're really
cool guys and um so we're gonna go and
watch them play you know we don't really
know what looks we're doing or what
we're all I have no idea we don't know
yeah
Chloe and I um we actually probably hung
out like together Buzzard does good oh
yeah and we like we just realized how
how similar we are gonna sleep
foundation this day I'm trying it
because I never raise it up what do you
have I use um at the moment I'm using my
copper Bob yeah I use it as well
oh god is it gonna be to to offer my
skin though no it's seriously the best
color I love it Wow look at that oh my
god do you love you changed to a say it
give me a minute we just filmed a boys
channel
boy talk boy chat video on Chloe's
channel we have to do is fast murder
here rapid bearded parties a little bit
upset because boys just you know they
can dictate your happiness a lot and
there's actually ridiculous
because like yeah it is Dom I can be
feeling on top of the world and then all
of a sudden looks like something that
someone says or like and I'm a very
happy person and I'm like where's can
just like ultimatum yeah I mean the same
I like I stopped with no any guys for
eight months because they would like I
just realized they detained by happiness
so much and I was just trying to see if
I could make myself happy and you can't
you just have to happen yeah it does
seem like that was like me I had like
fun a few months where I just didn't
bother when your eyes just to take time
out for myself and you actually like
yeah
I hang out with your friends as well
cause your friends are a big component
aiya totally Wow I don't know you do my
conceal off yeah so goes really well
Chloe so good at doing makeup she like
does a little touch-up on my face and I
feel like a new person
can see LA okay so uh nice thing right
now is the Mac Pro shade entity that on
your hand just a small bit cuz you don't
need much a lot and now I'm just taking
my Sigma soft blend concealer brush I'm
at F 64 and you just kind of DAB it
turning into like a hectic tutorial
Wow shush rod I'm bright little bit of a
Valencia um yeah I was telling Chloe
like how hard it's been to try and find
a house and buy because you guys know
that that's where I wanted to relocate
to but it's just been very stressful and
very difficult to try and find a house
because everyone's trying to move there
for summer and the real estate agents
are so unhelpful and obviously they
would rather rent out to a family and
then to some young teenager I'm sort of
thinking about like other options now
too and I guess like and I reallywe
didn't like my situation which is very
stressful and it's kind of making me act
like upset but everything happens for a
reason so I will come along exactly
finitary and I honestly believe that
everything happens for it oh it does
laughs and what if like nothing happened
for a reason and we're just running
around thinking that everything
happening for a reason
they're just completely stopping our
lives up oh well my eyes take so long
for me to do after Chloe and I am after
we film the boy talk video Who am I
flack just stay in tonight we're taking
all of our makeup off star movies in
moments maybe mum made a big veggie
stuff I got my period and I just want to
talk about how crucial back pain is and
I get back pain oh my god I don't get
that someone's stabbing you in the back
and even if my stomach starts hurting
for one second I'll just take a paddle
because I hate period pain cramps they
are you feel like I've never had suck
front pain do you know what back pain
feels I've had it once and it was just
uncomfortable but front pain like gets
me I just like cannot do anything I'm in
