current favorites at the moment because
everyone's been asking what skincare
I've been using and all these different
sorts of things I was like they're meant
to sit down and show you a selected for
your favorite so they're a little bit
sniffily at the moment because I've been
a bit sick that's okay we'll go past and
also I was three times feeling so crappy
and sick I really wanted to film and I
was like I need to make myself feel good
and that's what stars and sparkly stuff
does for me so that's why I had
Asperger's on my face and yeah before I
get started I just want to say a huge
thank you to everyone that turned up to
my garage sale or my little yard side
jokes on my friends in the barn so many
of you guys can hear it was ridiculous
and I had the best time in you and two
lovely girls that brought me coffee like
melting my heart was so sweet so thank
you meant a lot and hopefully I'll be
over sell some stuff online soon
everyone's been asking me to do that so
I will try and get around to it
ASAP okay so I'm gonna start off with
two skincare products the first one is
my holy grail like I'm pretty sure I've
spoken about this quite a few times
it is amazing everyone should get on
board with this and this is my trilogy
rosehip oil I always put this on at
night time off drive like cleanse and
explain it and stuff and it just like
rejuvenate just get it makes it brighter
and glowy ala it's like it's better than
using your moisturizer for me I feel
like it does more and it's not as greasy
like it honestly it sucked weird because
you're like I'm putting oil on my face
when they smash my face oily but it
totally does the opposite it's just like
it's just nice and glowy and just just
school I don't know if there's like so
much proper information about gross the
coil and what it does like warts in it
but it's got antioxidants in it as well
so if you have like scarring on pimples
it's so good for that it just clears
everything love it it's not as heavy as
oil and advice I can't put cutting oil
in my face it's just too much for us
before it too Jayla so this is the
second skin care product I've been
loving at the moment is the origins by
all greens deep cleansing and kind of
masks I love this because it is like a
two-in-one kind of mask and cleanse
let's so I say that origins did send
this product to me and they gave me like
a month or two to UM experiment with it
and playing around with it so I could
give a review to you guys and this is
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna give me a
little rundown review I have previously
collaborated with them and they sent me
another product before I absolutely
loved it so that's why I kind of was
keen to try this one out so yes this is
a sponsored video mention but trust me I
gave this about two months or so a month
I think I used it on my skin a few times
a week so here's my review it kind of
works is like a clay mask and a really
like high-performance cleanser and it
just kind of detoxify the skin and lays
it feeling really fresh and clean and
normally like after I put this on my
face and I put the rosehip oil on I love
that stuff it has some of my favorite
ingredients in it which is green tea is
really not in spinach and those
ingredients are so good not only for
your body but for your skin too I
absolutely love that that's kind of what
got my attention of this product and I
like the fact that it's two-in-one
because then you can give it like a
really really deep cleanse and what I
normally do with this is I just because
it comes out as I can kind of foamy
consistency so I just like put one
square on my hand
and then I don't rub it and I just like
apply a straight mass cuz if you're
doing like a face mask and I let it sit
for a bit and just like clean my skin
and then once I've kind of let it sit
for a bit I like wet the tips of my
fingers and then
kind of just like massage it into my
skin really gently so I can really get
into all my pores and then once I've
done that for long enough and it starts
to feel so nice on it saying to smell
everything it feels so fresh and nice
then once I've done that I'll rinse it
all up and just Pat my face dry so you
can get this product or other origins
pros in Sephora make Origins retail
stores or I think on origins comm so if
you would like to try get your hands on
fun but if you do want to find out I'll
put the link to this product down in the
description box and you guys can go and
check it out and and a heart oh my god
okay so I'm going to move on to some
jewelry that I've been loving at the
moment as well smell stuff I have to
start with these hoops I got these
sterling so little hoops from the bank
line markets and loving this look it's
kind of super vintage and retro and it
just goes with everything I always like
having earrings in and these are just
like kind of perfect ones to slip in it
also got these super cute earrings from
the same market stall at the bank loan
market earrings and they've got little
moons on the bottom too and I just think
this is so cute I wore these to Blues
Fest on one of the days if you saw my
last channel see episode and these are
just so adorable I think I think what a
few places kind of sell like little
constellation earrings like this but
yeah if you're a round buyer and
definitely go to the bank where markets
around like once a month they have so
much amazing jewelry next I have a few
little book favorites and the first one
I'm going to start with is this one that
Emma actually bought when she was in
Australia and she left it at my place by
accident or maybe on purpose
I'm not too sure but it's a crystals for
beginners book and this book is so so
amazing it um it pretty much gives you
like a rundown of all the crystal types
that there are and all about how they
fare
all about like what you can do with some
kind of thing super just light and easy
and it has a nice little drawings in it
so for me that's very good because I'm
not very good at reading like what I say
reading like my attention span just I
lose loser and I find it really hard to
read books but this one's really good
because you don't have to read it from
start to finish you can just flick
through and it's like oh that's
interesting you know just read a certain
part the people are asking me about like
can you give us a rundown on all the
crystals and stuff but I could sit there
for ages trying to tell you everything
that I know about pistols but I highly
recommend if you could just go to like a
a little crystal shop or something
they'll always have crystal rocks and
even normal bookstores will always have
kind of crystal books and all sorts of
things so beginner ones are really good
or there's like really hectic like big
ones it just depends how much you
already know and how much you want to
know and like how much depth you wanna
know about it I feel me my god I need it
gone another favorite is this hat you
guys know how obsessed I am with it he
goes well with my outfit but I wasn't
gonna wear it because everyone's like
you stop wearing the freaking hat
half the people love this hat or you
either hate this hat it just takes a
while to get used to this hat look at
first I was like eeny and now I'm like
mmm I love it it's my favorite thing but
only piece of advice if you're getting
this hat when you take it off the Hat
hair is like do things like a ten out of
ten
and it's not cute my next favorite is
this sick jacket that I got from mr.
vintage this is the print of it it's
like a big bomber jacket I'll put it on
to see you guys just to make me a little
bit more hot cuz I'm not already
sweating or anything it is the coolest
jacket I mean love it it's so pump me
you've got it from mr. venture to the
other day and that keeps a call like
denim jackets and all sorts of different
um clothing items and lay so if you're a
baron definitely go check out mr.
vintage they have a really really good
stuff it's like this thing that I'm kind
of keen on doing at the moment I like
thought about it and I told em wrenches
ik do is such a good idea
she gave me two of her little like
patches that I can like stick on
clothing and stuff and what I thought I
have this really cool denim jacket that
I want to decorate like winter and make
a have a good statement jacket I want
like a whole heat and I want all sorts
of cool different ones like all over the
world or like all different cool like
design ones and stuff but I don't know
where to get them and then I was like
wait a minute why don't I call out to
you guys if you have any of these spare
little patches or whatever you call them
whatever they are sitting on at home or
you know somewhere you can get them
really really cheap and you want to be a
part of my jacket sounds a weird like be
a part of my jacket but if you want to
like I'm not saying you have to I'm just
saying like it was really cool because
I'd love to have a piece of you guys on
one of my jackets that I can wear around
and it'd be really sick and and yeah
you'd see photos and your little hats
would be on my jacket you'd be like hey
it would be so very cool so I'm gonna
put my appear box down in the
description box and feel free just to
someone a little envelope and it would
honestly mean the world to me because
then I'll make then I'll have a day
where I decorate its jacket and I'll
show you guys how it looks in the end
but like anything cool that you think
would look good it can fit in with
anything honestly anything even like a
patch with like the state you're from or
wherever you're from in the world would
be so cool I just want to have like a
big jacket with a little piece of all of
you guys on
I heard being on this idea if you down
to second one the last few things that
I'll mention eyes have them written down
a lot favorite things
I have two favorite songs and an artist
and a video and then I really really
enjoyed so I'll start with my two
favorite songs I'm obsessed with the Sun
Loveland
by milky chance at the moment I've been
replaying it but not the not the
original studio version I'm in love with
their Spotify live session one from
Berlin just look up on if you've got
Spotify just look up lovely and live
from Spotify girl in it is amazing it
hits my like feels I'm like it's such a
nice song please go and listen to it
it's beautiful
I posted on my snapchat so I think a lot
of people like I know thank God I love
it too about yeah I love that song and I
also love the song beautiful criminal by
Al line-x just a good like get stuck in
your head and use like
I don't know I never thought I'd like
that song when I first listened to it I
kept listening to it and I was like okay
I'm hooked I'm addicted and my favorite
artist at the moment is Cali lucious she
is incredible freaking Emma was playing
her all the time and when she was
staying here and then I just kept
playing her her whole entire album my
favorite song from my album is low no
just beautiful song that's like a
Mirandized song my favorite video that I
watched the other day it's one of simply
Ken's videos and it was a video talking
about how we can save the clutter I
think it was cold or something along the
lines and I just I freaking love her I
enjoy her videos and I enjoy like what
she's about because she's always talking
about stuff on how to help me
environment
how to help people be more aware of it
she goes about in such a subtle and
gentle way and her voice is just so
beautiful to listen to her and she's so
stunning and she just seems like a
really good person and I think that
she's talking up about these things and
I've learned a lot from that video she
was talking about little things you can
do around your house and I mean in your
environment to help help save the planet
yeah I'll put the link to her video in
the description box you should all go
watch it it's very it's very gently
educating you guys want some things that
you may not know about the environment
hanging up and it's just simple things
that you can do that can really help out
so yeah back in yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed seeing my favorite there you
guys lots and lots I hope you enjoy it
