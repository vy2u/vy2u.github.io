puffing days I've just woken up 6:45
a.m. I am about to go to yoga and what
I'm doing as the next few days I'm going
to film like doulas vlog but talk more
about my health and fitness stuff and my
diet and I'm kind of following um I was
at fifteen days before I go back to LA
and I'm kind of really challenging
myself to get into shape
get my diet started because I have
previously lost quite a lot of weight
and I was just kind of on maintenance
and I do still have a bit of excess
weight that I want to try and get off
and this is my own personal journey this
is in no way saying that you guys like
losing weight is what everyone should be
doing and just trying to like make this
informative it allows plant-based diet
I'm I saw that plant my site if you can
lose weight with on eating plant-based
obviously so this here to give you my
tips my tricks let you guys know what
I'm doing on my journey because I wasn't
filming anything of it and I was kind of
just not only posting much clothing so
busy with him and I was like thank you
like I'm like like not talking to you
guys much at the moment I was like why
did I just film all this incredible
friend Lola has been helping me on my
journey it she's a nutritionist and she
has written me up a big eating plan put
it like kind of eating plan just like
more like foods to avoid food sickly and
we've been doing yoga together every day
so I'm about to go meet her it's got one
hour of hot vinyasa and then I have to
go and get laser and then oh yeah also
for this mentioned today I'm doing a
juice bar so that's going to be fun um
I'm just doing that one that once you've
passed this week so it's Wednesday chain
and one next Wednesday again and then
one more before you buy things
intermediate and here's one intermediate
fasting or some things I'll get Lola
toes playing all this I don't understand
what it all is but yesterday I went into
nimble and they gave me some yoga
goodies so that looked like a total noob
where were these ones this morning I
love the back of these
thanks nimble hooking me up because I
literally have the ugliest web peppers
not anymore honey honey up really early
let's do it Oh homie up the back and
things this morning it just passionate
don't teaching oh you know we're
finished oh girl I'm dead declined
because we have financing I did not
think enough what else
precious but don't worry well good so we
have just gotten to icebergs and ended
that was to swim in the beach I wanna
swim in the big waves but in honest
katie-cat and who did this morning so
we're going to go do three rounds of so
not and jump with an icy hole pool so we
started a fresh I'm excited movie time
and then the cleanse begins okay go then
it is as cold as that probably looks
right now
for reasons like us to get that movie
we've done a flim frozen
hey feelin like a drowned rat yes when
we sit down I'm going to get Lola to
explain why I'm going out one soft big
ones up a little today okay
starting off with a smoothie Bowl we'll
just adjust to the toppings to only be
chia coconut goji and strawberries why
have we done that because so today's
with intermittent fasting days and what
we're doing doing is you're having
eternity well for brekkie and then
you'll be doing three big juices
throughout the day and I'm having
another city bowl at nighttime which is
the one that you'll probably make
highlight the reason why was kept
 only no chop this up with like
no lore ultimatums here probably
sensitive adding a lot of sugar that we
don't want so the only complete nut in
this entire Bowl with green goodness is
just banana banana or using things like
TVs disco coconut goji berries and fresh
berries
any type of berry give you that
sweetness without a massive here ultra
grass that plant we just fall to the
right back and kept complex
carbohydrates really heart but not
really high but really falls in veggies
at lunch time Brett human she's already
killin a layer it is written fast is
that basically the body one it cleanses
and it's come to five today even adult
till metabolism so by doing the hot and
cold sauna stuff coupling it with one
day in an entire week and we reduce your
kind of like calorie in what it tricks
bodies like having a worse faster yeah
idea behind it
we start travelling them that's what we
want
I'm going to show you guys these are my
three juices for the day and then I've
also just gotten a turmeric ginger lemon
cayenne PHA I'm shot I am frozen it's so
cold right now and I'm still in my wet
cement under this really like painful
coldness we're going to watch a video

4-minute coming up it love Kelly Rosanna
M it should have so many times my videos
um but she had was a great astrology
Channel I'm such a little astronaut like
I love this in general like write notes
from what she says and any dates that
stand out it's just interesting for me I
just like to see like what happens when
they predict stuff and Volvo uh that's
just yeah I'm going to do that and then
I am going to my laser appointment and I
think I have a meeting with my manager
really I'm just trying to stay
distracted so I don't think about eating

then I went for my facial and I still
wasn't hungry I got home around like 7
o'clock and around like 7:30 I made my
dinner which was my protein smoothie so
pretty much it's just two scoops of
protein powder a few frozen berries and
ice and water and then on top I just put
some chopped up berries and some
jumped-up
coconut flakes and gradually so that was
Washington I wasn't allowed to have for
it and yes oh I still have one drew
