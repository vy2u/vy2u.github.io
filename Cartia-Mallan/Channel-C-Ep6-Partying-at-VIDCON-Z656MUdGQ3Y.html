in Anaheim
alright random little place and I'm just
about to head to VidCon sang with my
friend Michelle Fox who is another
blogger and no idea like what to expect
what's going on there or what
what is the VidCon but I'm sure we will
figure it all out as we go Michelle
stone here getting ready
Yonatan head of the vlog yet hello
what's up okay I'm gonna give them the
lowdown of what's actually going so when
I've loved in whatever I've looked
previously saying I'll going to VidCon I
went to VidCon today I didn't a
thing and we were just some was hanging
with one of her shows good friends Sam
and some of his other friends and Alex
Hayes and my friends from home and um I
don't know what do we even do today we
like went to Starbucks well we've been
up good boy is right sorry time boys and
it was basically like we were with a
buddy boy band because when the boys had
skateboards and they were all just like
super cool little bit richer and then
the most party look like the biggest
like okay we're going to the studio 71
party and so we have planned I'm gonna
try and film well I should try Irish
ellos like make sure you make me film
with my biggest bulky camera and you
stab my little like g7x whatever it was
but then I broke it horribly at the
beach I broke it horribly like and now I
have this one but this one's good
because as some of you guys love know
you guys hate the zooming
I'm currently you guys can feel the
struggle with me of what I don't know
what to wear at the moment I just have
my uh my stripy blue pants on with a
ripped shirt and I kinda think I'm
wearing pajamas
nice Rachelle's running my little jacket
I designed holy and the top it says
Elvis baby not to leave ya after I make
Rochelle skull tequila I'm gonna sculpt
oh okay with this on a quick camera
switch back to my old g7x which is
Rachelle's then i'm going to borrow
because my big old bulky camera is not
suitable for a nighttime logging
whatsoever the evening um okay so yeah
we're just gonna take a few shots and
then we're gonna call an uber and go
my meal replacement recommended thank
God Rachelle was there with you I know
such a manager need to be above it some
and straight job excuse me but there's a
dozen boxes on is going on
okay he's gonna walk the hallway do it
the hallway
on this man the astonishing fact of this
man of how much he bought this fall this
like beautiful we just found this in
Craigslist because we were like in a
panic we were literally gonna buy
anything we're about to buy some run
random like a creepy white van yeah we
will to the board right there and it was
only ten thousand dollars and this is a
1973 classic can we just show something
yes that right there anybody who knows
anything about your childhood
and this read knows that the Radio Flyer
wagon is like the most classic
children's toy from like the last 30
years and the fact that the van is
literally painted and branded in the
Radio Flyer is something that endeared
me to it instantaneously
there are so many Catania
I think it soon
Shawn I just got up am i having
breakfast in bed this have some fruit
yeah because um there's no food in
American like this like I don't know it
sometimes it's really hard to find like
healthy food

baby that I'm gonna be staying in
Silverlake for a few nights and then
I've also just booked my baby that I'm
staying with Haley in Venice before I go
to New York and I'm so excited I really
just wanted to book somewhere so then I
could this have like a few days to
myself to actually just get some work
