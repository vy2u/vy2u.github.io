yes I have quite a bit of explaining to
do so I don't even know what my last
step is that I filmed but whatever what
was it I had the beach oh sorry I'm
really sure but what happened was we
were all staying in one big house
together that was really close to like
the main arrow Byron but then me and
Emma had Brody's like proper 18th part
in the Saturday night so we just booked
out like another little Airbnb house
didn't really have a chance to vlog it
because um we were with Henry and we
decide went out and got lunch and stuff
and then we had to quickly get ready for
the party and it was all just a rush and
I was just really tired and I just
totally forgot to vlog I know I keep
saying that and it's really bad me I
need to just get my priorities throat
but um yeah so that happened and we went
to Brady's 18th and I was heaps of fun I
met lots of people there and I was just
a good night um and after that after
buddy's 18th we just went back to the
house and packed up all of our stuff the
next day and left I'm home now and the
weather is so so crap outside
I don't know thinking when I see it but
if you guys didn't realize a little bit
of a camera a quality change up I am
vlogging on my new vlog in camera Oh
freaking happy I was supposed to get
this camera before I went to Barron and
then it just decided to turn up when I
got home from Byron I'm really different
because the flip top camera is like up
the top now so if I'm ever looking up
then that's just me checking that it's
in focus but it's really weird
this camera is freaking amazing it
focuses so quickly and it's just so cool

the mood and I think I'm going to buy it
again this weekend oh my god I'm
addicted but um yeah I don't know
anything to get away from Brisbane I
will
