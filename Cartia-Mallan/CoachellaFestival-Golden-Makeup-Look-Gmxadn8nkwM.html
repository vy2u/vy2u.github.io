by priming my face with the
Porefessional primer I love this stuff
it just covers up all of my pores and
actually I think I'll quickly mention
before I jump to this video most of the
products that I am using I recently just
got from princess Polly they're all new
so I'm kind of testing them all out in
this video but if you want to see a haul
for all the new products I'm going to
leave this linked in my bio it's so much
fun playing with all the new makeup and
I'm so obsessed with it but I also have
a really special of discount code so you
guys get 20% off princess Polly so go
and enjoy that and yeah let's just
continue with this makeup look I'm going
to go in with some foundation I'm using
my new Becca cosmetics aqua luminous
foundation and I'm applying this with my
Real Techniques expert face brush this
is such a perfect combination this
foundation has such a beautiful kind of
joeys finish and to conceal i'm going in
with the napoleon perez concealing pan
and just applying this under my eyes and
a little triangle kind of shape and then
on my nose and forehead and chin you
guys know to draw with this and then
just buffing this into my skin and then
since festivals always get really hot
and sweaty a finishing powder is always
key for me so I'm just taking the camera
finish setting powder by Napoleon Perez
and applying a little bit of this onto
my skin as well and I love to keep this
in my bag to apply throughout the day
and then taking my favorite goof proof
brow pencil by Benefit I'm just filling
in my brows and then super exciting I'm
taking Mimi Beauty killer jeffree star
cosmetics eyeshadow palette I'm so in
love with this and taking this beautiful
gold shade and applying this just to the
base of my lid I was really kind of just
winging this as I was going and then I
just went ahead and added some of that
into my inner corner as well and then
just adding a really light transition
shade into my crease I love this one so
much it's the perfect brown turn going
back in and adding a bit more gold up to
highlight towards my brow bone almost I
don't know how to explain that but you
can kind of see what I'm doing it was
kind of random but it looked cool then
just taking a light white shade to
highlight my brow bone now with my Holy
Grail benefit push-up liner I'm going to
be applying this and obviously just
doing a big
out eyeliner look this is my favorite
thing to do I select it really opens my
eyes but do whatever you feel you're
most comfortable with this eyeliner is
incredible because it just does not
budge so it's perfect for a festival and
then just lightly applying some brow
brown eyeliner on to my waterline most
pop the eyes even more I'm taking this
really deep and dark purple shade and
applying this on my bottom lash line I
kind of love to really smoke up an eye
look there was my whole lot quickie just
contouring stick I'm going to contour
with this and you can kind of see where
I'm applying it just to all the hollows
of my face and places where I want a
little bit more color then I applied
some of my new Becca cosmetics just eye
brightening product and I love this up
this is really amazing just to put on to
really brighten up that under-eye
section and then I just sucked in the
cream hunter as well these products are
so nicely together I really love this as
with our summer youth both of them and
then taking my roller lash and just
applying a little bit of regard to my
bottom lash line because I have false
lashes on as you can see I mean lash
extensions and then I'm going ahead and
just bronzing up my face then with this
new Becca cosmetics blush palette I'm so
obsessed with this it has the most
beautiful tones I'm mixing these two and
applying a little bit onto my cheek just
to give a really nice flush rosy look to
the face and then with the teach got a
skin frost and I'm just taking this and
applying this until the usual points
where you would highlight I love to put
a lot of highlighter on susceptibles
just so I look super glowy and very boho
goddess
5 and then I love to add a bit onto my
decolletage and my collarbone with the
new benefit Double Trouble lipstick this
is so great this product has a lip liner
and a lipstick in it I love it I'm just
going to apply this to my lips I can't
remember which color Amy's but it will
be left down below and then I wanted to
deepen the tone a little bit so I went
in with Geoffrey star celebrity skin
just to kind of need to add a little bit
and make it a little less pink but now
for the fun part I kind of winged this I
just went in with some face and body
like glitter pen to use as my glue it
worked pretty well to keep all these
stars on and I just don't know as you
can see it popped on some stars under my
eyes you
do whatever you like here this is just
fun to get really creative and then I
did the same on both sides but I also
went ahead and added in some bigger
stars as you're pleased right now I just
pop them up here and then added a big
one to make it look like a shooting star
I hope you guys enjoyed seeing this
little festival makeup look I love doing
sensible makeup it is so much fun and I
hope you enjoyed seeing this little
outfit to everything I am wearing it's
from princess Polly honestly Polly is
just be one-stop-shop for festival gear
