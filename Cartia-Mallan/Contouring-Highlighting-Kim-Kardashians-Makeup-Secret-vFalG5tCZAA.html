and highlight similar to how Kim
Kardashian does hurt now let's go over
what you'll need for this makeup look
we need a primer a highlighting
concealer foundation foundation several
shades darker than your skin tone a
setting powder bronzer and a highlighter
so now that you know what you'll need
for this video let's get straight into
it
first I'm starting by priming my face
then I'm going to go ahead and put on at
my foundation now I do recommend using a
light to medium coverage coverage
foundation because this will just help
the products go on way easier also all
the products that I use will be listed
in the down bar now I'm going to be
taking the highlighting concealer from
the corner of my eye up to my hairline
in a v-shape formation and I'm also
going to be running it down my nose and
also the top of my forehead then I'll be
placing some on my chin and also running
some just under the hollows of my cheek
taking my darker foundation which is in
a stick form I'm going to be putting
this in the hollows of my cheek now
doesn't matter if it's not really neat
because we're blending it out anyways
then taking one end of this brush I'm
going to be contouring my nose to make
it appear slimmer now you don't really
have to do this step if you already have
quite a slim nose but I'm just going to
do it anyways to show you now finally
I'm taking the other end of the brush
and placing the darker foundation on the
top temples of my head and along my
hairline now this step is optional but
if you want to make your face appear
even slimmer you can contour around your
jaw line now that you've contoured and
highlighted you're going to want to take
a brush or a sponge of some sort and
firstly start blending out the concealer
now I'm doing this first because I want
this area to stay and appear quite
bright
then taking a fluffy small joy fiber
brush I'm going to be blending out my
nose lightly and then with a bigger face
brush that I can really get in and blend
my face with I'm going to do that and
move the brush around in circular
motions just to really buff it into the
skin and blend it all out
this is it all blended together now
you're going to want to set your
concealer by applying a setting powder
you can either stop here or you can keep
going to accentuate this contour and
highlight even more by applying a
bronzer on a small fluffy brush right to
where we put the darker foundation now
this will really create a Kim Kardashian
look as she always has a very structured
cheekbone sort of area look then also
just going over the nose as well then
I'm taking a fluffier brush just to
blend this out and to get rid of any
harsh lines now to take the contour
another step further again you can put
that concealer back underneath where you
put the contour and this will really
make a defined cheekbone then if you
want you can also take some color to the
cheeks by applying some blush to the
apples of your cheeks and you can also
drag it up a little bit towards your
temples to give a flushed sunkissed look
then finally to highlight I'm taking my
highlighter and applying it on top of
the cheekbone and I'll also be putting
at some neon my nose and my chin in my
forehead just pretty much everywhere we
put that lighter concealer
I've also gone ahead and add a little
bit to my Cupid's bow now to finish up
I've just gone ahead and added some of
this pretty pink lip gloss to bring the
look altogether as you can see from the
before and after it will just make your
skin look really gorgeous natural and
glowy I hope you've enjoyed this video
