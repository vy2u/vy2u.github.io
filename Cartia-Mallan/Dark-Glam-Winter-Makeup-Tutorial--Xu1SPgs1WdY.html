being like a million years since I've
recorded I'm gonna close the window I'm
gonna close oh no look I've it's
literally been that long there I've just
forgotten how to do this stuff and I'm
off my game I'm really disappointed in
myself not gonna live turn back with a
dramatic kind of vampy winter makeup
tutorial I don't usually do many really
dramatic heavy full face makeup
tutorials but I'm gonna start trying to
do some different makeup looks that
aren't already on my channel because a
lot of my looks are really quite basic
and simple and um you guys asked for it
so I'm gonna do it um I don't know why
I'm talking like that thora
really excited to be getting back into
doing makeup tutorials because I've been
so ridiculously busy that I just haven't
had time to actually sit down and get
the filming done so this is exciting
we're back I've missed you have you been
I think right how about you I just
answered so I'm gonna stop babbling and
like always do if you're happy that I'm
back doing makeup tutorials don't forget
to thumbs it up because it means the
world to me if you guys want to see how
I got this makeup look then please keep
watching okay let's start with the eyes
I'm taking my soft ochre Paint Pot by
Mac and I'm just putting this on as a
base then with my Sigma warm tones I
think it's called eyeshadow palette I'm
taking this light brown I'm just going
to be
putting this in my crease using it as a
transition shade and I'm just blending
it in with a really like soft fluffy
brush then with this kind of like dark
purpley toner how you discover I'm
taking more of like a pencil brush and
applying this right into the crease and
like out of the area I don't know I kind
of just chuck it on messily like I don't
know how to put this on very well or
explain this but just put it in that
area and then what I like to do
afterwards is you just blend it out so
it doesn't have to be perfect from the
start so taking that same a big blending
brush or like you can take a different
one it doesn't really matter people
clean the clean one I don't know I'm not
too fancy with it but I just like to
blend it all out then with these two
like light shimmer tones and what I'm
going to be doing is taking a flat
shader brush and applying this color of
these colors into my inner corners and
just kind of a little bit up into the
crease if that makes sense you can kind
of see it up to it and then just lightly
putting it on the lid and then once
again I'm gonna blend it all out taking
a brown eyeliner pencil I'm putting this
on my lower lash line and then just
lightly blending with my fingers then
with a liquid eyeliner I'm going to be
just putting on putting pushing this on
and winging it out and it's what it
looks like oh yeah
then with my Maybelline partner my
Rimmel mascara I just cannot talk to
I'm really sorry I'm just going to be
applying a light coat of this before
putting on these false lashes now
they're only really like subtle false
lash there's nothing too crazy but you
do what you're comfortable with then
with my Rimmel primer I'm putting this
on as a base and then I'm taking a my
Rimmel wake me up concealer and I'm
putting this under my eyes to cancel out
any discoloration and dark circles then
on my disgusting
pimple Yawk and also just on the bridge
of my nose and my forehead just to give
a little bit of a highlight that I'm
just going to go ahead and buff this in
then I'm just blending these two colors
of my Make Up For Ever HD foundation and
I'm just buffing this across across my
face onto my face and I love this
foundation because a nice full coverage
and it doesn't look too cakey though and
then to set this on place I'm taking my
mac studio fix powder and just patting
this across my face with a big Sigma
face brush which I've been loving at the
moment it's been my favorite since soft
yes oh my god I'm going crazy today with
this voiceovers but um my eyebrows went
totally crazy in this video I'm really
sorry but I'm just using me this little
essence eyebrow pencil and just a
spoolie and blending them out I didn't
do anything special with them really
just pretty basic and then taking my
gimme brow to just set it all in place
just know make them look nice
full pretty and you know then with the
darkest shade of my sleek contour kit
I'm going to be taking this on a brush
and really kind of partially I guess you
could say defining out my cheekbones I'm
applying quite a bit of product but I
will be then going back with this brush
and blending it all out once I put the
product in place so I'm just putting it
on my cheekbones then going up towards
my temple to give more of a slim defined
looking and structure then with it's
really gorgeous glowy bronzy tone I'm
going to be taking this and putting it
over the top of this to give a nice
shimmer taking my insane Bosh from the
bottom it's is really beautiful kind of
purply dark pebbles tone of cleanness on
my cheeks and then to highlight I'm
using soft and gentle and I don't know
personally I love a really highlighted
look I think it looks more glamorous but
if you like a mattified and very
structured kind of look and not too
glory then you can just skip this step
so this is the face all done and let's
move on to the star of the show the
lipstick I'm taking rebel by Mac and I'm
just applying this all over my lips
so this is the final makeup look I hope
