yeah yeah and I have a literally that
was down to my butt okay fine
you
Wow okay oh my god I feel like I just
have so much to talk to you guys about
let's just let's just have a quick chat
before I just start getting ready right
I look so trash I feel so rundown just
so tired and stressed someone should
talk to you guys about a is the last
official day of Fashion Week well like
for the shows that I'm doing the only
show I have today is Justin cast in
which josh is walking in so it's so
exciting he's never walked one runway
before so I literally can't even talk
but we have a massive ulcer on the top
of my like gum and my teeth or so so I'm
just like run down it's extreme sorry to
put any bat bad vibes I'm just
like being honest this week is so
stressful for me yes I just like anyways
wait let me finish my story first and
then I'll go into that um CI Josh's
never walk work runway before so we've
got our whole group of friends all
coming to watch him and I'm so excited
to see him water he's so cool he's
opening and closing it so that's amazing
but yeah so I literally I didn't have an
outfit sorted because everything
literally just fell to last minute
I had a stylist and she went away and we
didn't have any looks sorted so it was
just like stressful trying to pull
everything together and you guys know me
like my style is like so important to me
like it's I always want to like be
truthful to myself and when I don't feel
like I'm dressing like myself we're
trying to dress like someone else or be
like someone else it just makes me upset
and feel really stressed and it's such a
silly small thing but it means so much
to me so I really wanted to make sure I
actually felt and looked like myself
tonight and so I finally just pulled
together a look thank God because I'll
it shows like I'm gonna have to go buy
something and like you know like
last-minute shopping it just doesn't
normally work out properly
I was like I don't want to spend a lot
of money anyways I'm rambling
I find Fashion Week really stressful and
like if you saw my blog lost yeah I
spoke about it it was stressful for me
then to it I just like stressful because
it's a lot you're doing a lot every day
there's a lot of people and I find
myself kind of falling into a bad mine
states of comparing myself to other
people or not quite feeling good enough
or you know it's just like really it's
just silly like it's silly to fall into
those head spaces but also just really
putting way too much pressure on myself
to be doing something I'll be someone or
I don't know like it's really hard to
explain but I last night didn't go to
one of the show I did another client
liaison show us I was so bummed about
because I love them and they've like
launched his clothing line which is so
cool but I just literally was like don't
go like you're in the worst headspace
you're so stressed out you're being so
negative I feel like people who love
they've met me over the past few days
probably been like Katya is such a mean
person I'm just so negative and like
rude because I feel like I've been
having conversations with people and I'm
just not even there like I'm literally
like a space cadet just like there's
also a new moon so like I felt the full
effects of that but like I just feel
like I've been so negative and not me
like so again like don't literally
acting just opposite to anything I
preach and I it just made me really
upset that like I've fallen into that
kind of space just and gotten stressed
over just such small little things but
I'm aware and pulling myself up on it
and I just want to enjoy today and this
isn't supposed to be a stressful
experience supposed to be enjoyable and
self expressive and enjoying fashion so
yeah but that's just how I've been
feeling so sorry the vlog so probably
the vlog has probably been literally
just like make up and please from the
show make up these fish like I haven't
even really been showing you guys my
outfits which I've actually been quite
happy with how they've pulled up last
minute but mainly like I'm so excited
cuz I'm working with Sasha my good
friend on my makeup everyday and she's
just such a beautiful human and it's
been so lovely just everyday having her
help me out with makeup like obviously
in doubt myself I always have good ideas
but I'm not the best at doing it so it's
been so fun and like I'm really done
much makeup on here in a while so I
wanted to show you guys kind of
the different makeup looks we've been
doing and literally doing my makeup each
morning is like the only time just have
like chillin so it's easy for me to just
set up a camera
anyways I'm rambling I really need a
meditate like I can feel like this whole
week is just feel like my head is just
like fold and clouded so I'm gonna try
meditate for 15 minutes before Sasha
comes and then I have well it's like
it's like almost 10 10 a.m. now and I
have lunch with IMG are at 12 so I just
have to really quickly get ready to do
my makeup and then race home get dressed
and ready for the Justin casting show
and then everyone's gonna come here and
we're gonna go to the show what's Josh I
literally fly you guys wait right here I
was chatting but excited because I've
got I'm doing the panel with Grazia
magazine on Saturday night and I love
talking as you can tell I love doing
panels baking things that'd be really
cool I just wanted to say that I'm
talking like let you guys know that
everything looks so glamorous and
everyone says it always looks really
glamorous and I wish I could post on my
I mean like I'm actually not that happy
like I'm really stressed but I don't
want to bring that vibe you know I like
I don't want to post that bad but I just
wanted to be able to talk and show you
guys like I struggle just as much with
like comparing myself and anxiety and
stress that like as anyone else does
even though I'm quite a positive happy
person like I've definitely just felt so
 this week and I think I wasn't
really just this week I was already
really stressed in my life from the
weeks leading up to this just with all
the stuff going on so it when stress
builds off it's honestly I didn't I've
never really dealt with much stress in
my whole life because I'm quite a calm
just like go with the flow whatever
happens whatever happens person but as
I've gotten older I'm feeling stressed
more it's why my teeth is so so like and
ulcers it's all stress like I'm just I
notice it in my body so I need to look
after myself more and I Nina stop
putting so much pressure on myself I
need to be kind to myself and recognize
my the good things I'm doing over the
night
of things yeah
there's Sasha let's do some makeup
