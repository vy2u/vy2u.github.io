simple bronzy eye makeup tutorial which
is perfect for summer so if you want to
find out keep watching so as a primer
and base I'll be applying my Mac Paint
Pot in soft ochre all over the lid then
with my Kardashian Kollection cream
eyeshadow I'll be applying this all over
the lid with a little sponge brush then
with this really pretty um single eye
pigment from Mac in Naked Lunch I'll be
taking this and applying it all over the
lid on top of that color to intensify
the shimmer even more and it's got a
slight pink undertone then with its
really nice bronze blush in warm soul
I'll be taking this on my Mac blending
brush and applying it to the crease very
lightly and this will just start to kind
of bronze up the eye and the color can
certainly be built up then with my
favorite still in the light eyeshadow
palette I'll be taking this really nice
rusty color called sunset and applying
it close to the lash line and blending
it up into that grungy warm sole color
and now blending all of the cards
together with my Sigma I'm blending
brush then I'll be lining my eyes with
his brown eyeliner now I am doing this
just under the waterline because I feel
so it opens up my eyes just a little bit
more then with my Rimmel gel liner I'm
going to be lining my eyes in a wind out
kind of formation to intensify the line
I've gone over with my maybelline liquid
liner now for something a little
different I've decided to give it a
little bit of a exotic kind of look so
I'll be dragging the liner right down
into my inner corner and matching the
line up with the other line that I've
drawn before then to soften that the
liner just slightly I'm taking my
smudging little sponge on the end of my
eyeliner to smudge it all out
my they're real mascara from benefit I
would just be applying my mascara as per
usual now here's just a close-up of the
eyes completed it is so simple and it's
only a few steps to get this look now
for the rest of the face it is a summery
look I'll be taking my math bronzer and
contouring my cheeks and also just
applying some to the temples of my head
to warm up the rest of my face then
applying this gorgeous blush in the
color margin by Mac I'll be putting this
on my cheeks to give even more of a
bronzey summer glow
then I will be applying my anoxia
lipstick in the colour peach and cream
it's a really lovely new color with a
bit of an apricot peachy pink undertone
I'm seriously in love with their
lipsticks they're all so nice and creamy
and they smell absolutely amazing too
and finally I'll be taking my little
Urban Decay lipgloss from my naked 2
palette and I'll just be applying this
over the top of that lipstick to give it
a glossy glowy look now I've also just
thought I'd add in that I've curled my
hair in little beachy waves and it looks
like this all together now thank you so
much for watching and don't forget to
check out the description box for all
the information and details on this look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
