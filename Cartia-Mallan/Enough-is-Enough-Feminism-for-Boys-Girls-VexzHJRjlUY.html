have a very important chat this chat
doesn't only apply to girls this applies
to boys too it's going to be a very
personal chat about my own experience
with this topic and with my views on it
and I really think it's a very very
important thing to talk about so I'm
talking about feminism today I want to
speak about what it is what's going on
in the world what I've sort of want to
talk about more is how did we get to
this point like let's backtrack like
kind of start figuring out in a head so
we actually really know what it's about
and how we can make some changes not
only for girls to be more aware of
what's going on but really for guys to
kind of pick out in their friendship
groups maybe what they might do that is
not helping out with the current
situation
anyways that's a time a little bit of a
criminal if you guys have never seen one
of my videos before hello i'm Karndean
milan and welcome to my channel if
you're not already subscribed I'll be
posting in many more videos I'm talking
about certain topics like this very
shortly in the future so don't forget to
subscribe and you'll be in the loop of
all the videos that come out anyways I
want to get started on this because I
have a lot to say and talk to you guys
about how I got to the point where I am
now saying I'm a feminist and it's not
just because I watched some videos of
other girls talking about it this is my
own personal journey with it this is my
story um some of this is kind of
uncomfortable to talk about it might be
uncomfortable to listen to it but I'm
not gonna this like this is
real this stuff happens and we need to
be able to talk about it because like
what's the point of sugarcoating this
crap like it happens and my story is
probably nowhere near as bad as what has
happened to so many other girls and also
boys this is not just about girls this
is also about always maybe being pushed
into certain situations they don't want
to be involved in because it's peer
pressure because other stuff and it I
have some notes if I keep looking down
it's just because I'm like need to keep
on track with my points I'm just going
to read out what I've written down and
then I can expand on it
I grew up being completely objectified I
was taught to sexualize myself to be
given the approval from a man and when I
say man I mean the boys that were living
where I was that were going to the
parties I was going to and not only to
be um given approval from them but also
from my girlfriends at the time and the
girl group and like the friendship group
that I was in I did this because this
would make me cool up this would
validate me it eventually came to a
point where the only reason we went to
parties and we'd go out was to hook up
with boys and whoever could get the
hottest guy of the coolest guy this is
the reason why we went we dressed up
tight dresses high heels a hole in my
kimono place and we just went to go and
try and be seen and to be into a peer
tool and to look cool and to try and get
with the coolest guy because then you'd
be the coolest girl right then you'd be
validated in the group you went with
your friends the back I'm going to show
my friends over because she's cool and
we made to feel like total I
remember every single pyro in town
talking about this is when I was in
maybe grade or something kind of grade 9
we started going to these parties and it
was when everyone started drinking and
to an all-girls private school so we
started going to parties with other boys
I went to all-boys private schools and
other girls practicals and I was friends
with girls not only from my school but
from a few other private girl schools
this make sense I was kind of in in this
group they were all the cool girls or
whatever the hell it was I'm honestly
also not afraid to talk about there's
some of them are probably watching this
right now and this is what it is like
I'm not afraid to talk about this stuff
right now because it was like
what we went through was actually
and I hope that maybe if they're
watching this now you can reflect on
what actually went on I'm gonna tell a
story of the one party I remember where
I honestly felt like total where it
all kind of started but this was when I
was in grade 9 I was with a group of
girls from a particular or girl's
private school and that was a few of us
from different schools into a party with
older guys and there were some older
girls there two of them in the grades
above us and I was with maybe about six
other girls and so we walk into the
party and at this point in time I I was
not like a hot girl or anything I was
pretty chubby I was in my school amorous
looking person ever and so I already had
a lot of anxiety going to certain
parties with big groups of guys and
something I was always scared what they
might think of me if they would call me
fat or if they would call me names or
whatever and I was always scary being
around the older grades of girls because
they were so rude everyone was so rude
to each other no one was welcoming I was
now so I was pretty nervous already
going to his party so we all walk in the
door and I remember the first thing was
all these guys just stand it up they'll
just turn and just stand it up one guy
goes or everyone line up against that
wall so we're all just like okay like
we're younger we just wanted to be cool
I wanted to fit in with this cool group
of guys so we all lined up against the
wall and I just remember between a few
of them they all started numbering us
like out of ten like we're rating ours
so you know for the hot girls it was
fine they were like oh she's a nine and
then for them they're like confidence
boost and then when you get rated like a
lower number it's like okay my nights
when he started so I'm pretty sure
I just I knew what was going on I was
like this isn't going well I was already
like I know that they're not gonna like
me because I'm chubby like I was a
chubby girl seriously I'm like was not
as good-looking as these other
stick-thin girls that were next to me
after they did that I remember I just
felt so uncomfortable and then my
friends I can't have a drink just put
yourself a drink will be fine a lot and
so I tried to kind of like talk myself
into I tried to like be like yes he's
fine but with like these really cool
guys like I've always wanted hang out
with them I guess so girl whatever and I
remember nothing got better it was so
awkward I was just walking around this
party like it's all these older people I
didn't really know anyone
my girlfriend's over there at the time
we're just getting smashed or already
hooking up with these guys and it was
just almost like we went to the party
just to get with these guys I honestly
felt like crap so I went over my friend
and I was like can we please go like
really begging her I was like I feel
more uncomfortable I want to leave like
can you please come with me like I was
in the middle of no I didn't know where
I was I was supposed to be stay at my
friend's house at night and yeah so um
she was like no babe it's fine like she
put up freakin goon sack and was like
just drink I get drink more just keep
drinking you'll be fine
so that's what I did I had no other
options so I just got super smash to
make myself feel better and that night
like I was dangerously drunk like I was
about to black out I was crying I was
vomiting everywhere and that was my
first experience being super drunk
that's where it kind started for me so
to me at that time I guess I understood
that was completely normal I didn't
stand up to the guys and say you can't
 lie nice offered a number us and
you can't call me names like I totally
heard people calling me names I know and
like just staring at me like in a room
like not being welcoming just kind of
been like what are you doing here type
thing yes that's also where my
self-consciousness kind of started
kicking in and when I started to become
a very self-conscious person because
before that I was chubby and I didn't
care I was still a happy girl and I was
like I didn't care about it as much
there was no pressure for me to really
worry about it and it wasn't until these
boys put themselves above all and pretty
much then the minute that the boys
started calling me names and saying that
I wasn't good enough that's when I was
like oh okay I'm not good enough
and that's also when I started comparing
myself to the other girls I was lined up
next to also she got a 9 because she's
skinny and has long hair ok I need
to lose some weight and I need to get
longer hair and this is where in my mind
it started going I've been able to
backtrack to that exact night as to
where some of the issues I have now and
some of the issues I've been through
over the past years literally came from
in your head you might be thinking of
something that might have happened to
you when something awkward like that not
awkward just like up
uncomfortable happen where someone's
objectified you now that's what that was
I will talk about when we backtrack
feminism I want to speak about how
people may have objectified you and
that's what hap
women get objectified as if they're like
an object a girl when going to a party
and line up a boy and be like okay I'm
going to rate your boys it'd be like
hell no off what do you think
you're doing they have courage to speak
up to women because they've put
themselves in a higher platform for
girls we immediately get objectified
someone puts themselves above us we just
quote okay
and we suck it up we feel like we
literally just give in to the fact that
we are objects for them to play with and
okay I just want to say before I keep
going this does not this is not me
hating on men this is not me handing on
boys this is me literally stating what
some boys do I know there's some amazing
guys out there that do not do this stuff
because you probably switched onto the
fact that it's totally up but if
you're a guy that's still kind of does
this and treats women this way then
I'm seriously saying it's not okay you
girls are watching this you need to get
to a point seriously where you can speak
this way and up front say to a boy no
that is not okay don't be afraid that
they're going to turn around and call
your name like if that's all that you're
scared of that they're going to turn
around and further objectify you then
you freaking get on your high horse
again and you shut them down again yeah
just gonna keep going getting really mad
about this limits and I can't
believe the fact that I used to think
that was normal then I got ahead of
myself but after that I wrote it's not
feminism it's equal ism it's about
teaching men what they can and can't say
to girls this well this is personal to
me this is what I've grown up with so
this may not apply to you but when where
I grew up there's all as I said all the
girls private schools and all the Boy
Scouts cause I lived in a bubble world
of this this was my world it was going
to school and going to these parties
with these people these are the people
that were around and this is what was
happening boys private schools there had
other rugby teams like my brother went
to one of the private schools which I
hung out guys in my grade from that
school they were all really rugby
orientated like sports babes really guys
or like macho like oh yeah got with this
chick did that like really just Bowl
girl like they really move quite vulgar
I don't think I ever heard
my brother's friends speaking about oh I
took this guy on a day and I really my
hair I really liked her she was a great
personality I was always I am she's hot
she's got the biggest teeth with us such
a good body or I hear them say horrible
stuff like air that girl's right she's
such a prawn though and they were poor
would me and go with a good body but a
horrible face so they always just had
something to say that was negative they
would never speak about women in a
respectful way so it started from there
hearing my brother's friends talk I
always thought would that's just how
girls are spoken about was times me
where I go to a party and I would be so
nervous to go and I just been anxious
wreck that a boy would come up to me and
be like oh you're so fat and ugly or
something like all these names would be
thrown about they would openly say this
stuff and then say it not only about me
let's head up the girls I was with and
then like there was a few selected hot
girls that every guy would try and get
and like it was like we were just there
as their sidekicks like and I don't know
why we kept going or why I kept going to
these parties it was like that I had to
go to be validated and then I have to go
and try and get with the cool guy each
time to be validated and I don't know if
this is the same and whatever was
happening in all these other girls minds
but this is what happened for me this is
literally what I did was like school
didn't even matter
it was always about the weekend and
partying and about boys and so this is
where lots of girls in my grade side of
having eating disorders and they started
being bulimic most people would start to
get to press and they would start things
self harm on themselves and I truly
 believe it comes from being
objectified because we're taught that
we're not good enough even a parent
figure can objectify you just I don't
wanna play even growing up like whether
he knew it or not my dad completely
objectified me as well and would always
put pressure on me about what I was
eating and about my body and that's not
fair to do to young people even boys you
can't tell you can't from a young age
start telling people that they have to
change things about themselves to fit
into a certain mold it is so
traumatizing and you grow up with it and
you think that's what is okay
didn't want to get personal with that
but it's true and like that stuff stays
with you I'm getting it right now is
kind of like I feel like to get to a
point to move on you have to think about
what may have possibly happened to you
in the past and there has been so many
times in my life where boys have up
front to my face made sexual comments to
me forcefully throw themselves on me in
a way that I was just kind of meant to
tend to them as in like this is what I'm
only here to do hey is that boys talk
about girls as if they're crazy
like they have so many trust issues and
they can barely protect it when they
come they take time to get ready and
they put on this makeup and they fuss
over there's no fuss over that they're
not as easygoing we've never had the
 time to be easygoing or be
chilled about something because ever
since we grew up ever since we were
young male gender has all his
objectified us it comes from movies come
from TV shows it comes from books it
comes from porn it comes from everything
even in Disney movies that whole Prince
Charming and like we'll do everything to
get Prince Charming and once we get him
then we live happily ever after and
we're constantly chasing for that and
we're constantly thriving for a better
this and a better that to keep
impressing and to strive higher and to
just be accepted look in the next movie
you watch how they objectify women and
comments that have said as a joke to
girls about their body or about stuff
and the girl in the middle who we
dislike and she's acting like it's chill
but inside she's obviously not
happy that someone just said that term
but we're made to feel as though it's
normal quote now I don't stand from
anyone like I am at a point where I'm
comfortable enough now to shut down a
guy or shut down a girl that is saying
stuff that makes me feel uncomfortable
and I'm telling you that's taking years
for me to do I used to just let them
saying to me because I was too scared to
cause a fuss or for someone to think
badly of me
or if it would make me seem like a loser
or whatever I'm like honestly a point
now where I'm like I want to preach to
young girls that it's time to speak up
you need to find your inner strength
you're in a voice with
these situations our lives and nothing's
ever going to frickin change because
we're talking about feminism and
everyone's like I'm a feminist but I'm
like when's the last time you actually
stood up to someone that said something
really messed up to you
be a girl that's like if a guy says
something to you be like hey you can't
say that to me have been a girl that
stands up for themselves and stands up
for their girlfriends and flip how this
situation works we want equality in all
scenario it needs to be this this is for
boys
yes Eman ISM has a bad name because it
seems like it's just girls bagging out
boys and yes in some way it kind of is
because I feel sorry for boys oh this is
how you guys have also been brought up
this is not at all really 100% your
fault none of this is 100% anyone's
fault it's social conformity and social
structures from past generations this is
a new generation we live in a totally
new generation from anyone else before
I'm saying the boys it's more or less
like why don't you start shaping the way
that this is so then girls we don't have
to make videos like this making you guys
sound like you're evil cuz you're not
boys have hearts boys have feelings too
like you guys are not the enemy in this
it's just about you need to retrain
yourself just as girls have to retrain
themselves about stuff as well it's all
about being retrained and re wired in
your mind to understand what is
acceptable and what is not don't throw
away comments especially not negative
ones about someone so with my job since
I'm in like on social media I'm kind of
in the industry like TV and I'm
celebrities and there's events and
famous people and I encounter people
that are in the spotlight and people say
it's all glamorous and it's all
beautiful and it is it's fun and like
I'm not going to lie I have good times
like being able to experience that side
of life and with those people that are
um that are famous and they've been like
successful people and stuff but I could
get in trouble for speaking out about
stuff like this and I really don't give
a because just because someone is
of a higher status doesn't ever give
them a whole path to being sexist
and Foggia nest and yes
so my next example is when I was at the
after-party a very big event in Sydney
and there was lots of famous models
there those actors they're musicians and
I was an after party with a group of
these people and lots of big names were
there and so I was kind of like okay
this is chillin whatever I mean like it
was kind of because everyone speaks
like with their tongue tied up in the
back bed throughout no one's to say
anything too controversial because they
don't want to be obscure they all want
to fit in because maybe if they say
something a little out of line and they
won't get the contract with that guy for
that movie they may not make as much
money with here maybe they'll have a bad
press release maybe something might not
go in their way and so instead we all
stand around and it's all oh you look
lovely don't you at such a beautiful
dress or what a great suit oh great
performers like complimenting and and
just stroking people's egos just try and
avoid bringing bad attention to
ourselves and then we have the the boys
over there getting really drunk and
making ridiculous comments about things
and saying things to girls just because
it makes them seem really cool within a
group and I remember I was getting very
frustrated I was with Ashton and she can
tell you first and I was fuming I'd be
going to the corner just like I can't
stand this everyone is so fake
everyone is so like I literally felt
like I had a clump in my throat because
I was not couldn't speak like a normal
person I couldn't fluidly speak it was
already hmm-hmm
and like I could have seen people's eyes
I was just watching and scanning the
room and judging some judgment anyways
we were drinking and stuff and I got
into a conversation we were all it was
me Ashton these two models that's really
being quite straight up with you
so this guy was trying to get Ashton
Knight to go back to his room to pretty
much hook up with him and um
a mutual friend was there and he was
like oh that's not gonna happen Ashton
as a boyfriend
he makes Foreman Indy goes oh when does
that ever matter and this is when I just
literally I lost my I was like are
you kidding me and I just walked
straight over to him I
my finger on his chest and I was like
you respect people's
relationships i straight-up like I'm
just a blogger like I'm nowhere near as
a famous nobody was big as these other
people and I was like I'm done
I could have caused a biggest thing than
I did just because you're someone or
you're famous or your model or you're an
actor or you're you you should never put
yourself above someone and everything
that comments like that are acceptable
like have some respect and so I kind of
got to that point where I was like that
was the first time I'd ever really
spoken up myself and I did it in a big
group of all these people in the
industry but I remember after that event
her speaking table and I was like how am
I ever going to be in this industry like
I want to do acting on those stuff but I
can't deal with everyone in it because
they're all through and they're all
self-absorbed and they don't know how to
treat people correctly and I spoke to so
many people know like you just got to
suck it up that's what the industry is
like you've just got to deal with it I
was like what I just have to deal with
the making comments about me and saying
this stuff about me and like or saying
stuff to me and submit and everyone I
spoke to is kind of just like oh yeah I
guess so it kind of was saying you just
have to suck it up because otherwise
you're going to ruin your reputation
otherwise you might not be booked for
that job
you might not get as far in your career
you have to suck it up and this is what
you have to deal with and I get it to
some extent you've got to deal with
people being a little bit rude of being
harsh but constructive criticism is
different to being talked down upon or
being sexualized or being used just to
that reasoning it would be a pretty face
that they can latch on to to make them
look better and I got to a point after a
few more events after that of sucking it
up and just trying to bite my tongue I
literally got to where I'm at now and
I'm like screw my reputation care about
me and my soul and my heart and what the
damage is being done right I will either
stand there being sucked up and being
spoken to in this way not saying it
happens often not saying there's people
saying horrible things to me at events
it's also what I hear them saying to
other people I'm very sensitive person
I'm very empathetic I don't think it's
fair and I honestly hold anger that
people think it's okay to do this and
making this video giving examples of
what
been through and I could have gone into
much more detail like there's some
really horrible stories in there and
it's a really horrible that's
happened to me and having people around
me and I know that you guys all probably
have your own individual stories and
there's some really bad situations but I
want I wanted to backtrack it so then
maybe you can realize what feminism
really is about being an equalist
wanting to be equal with a man and I
want boys to understand what feminism is
about they would you like this to
happen to you would you like to be
spoken in such horrible ways and to then
question who you are as a person and
what you look like I don't think so
and it's a harder reality for you to
think about cuz it's probably never
going to happen do so maybe have some
sympathy and stopping dickheads and
start being kind and within your guy
groups stop trying to be the coolest guy
out and stop trying to just fit in with
your guy friends and talking horribly
about women in certain ways like that
what I'll say it again we've seen movies
we've seen TV shows and we've seen porn
is not real life there dramatized
heightened versions of what is and
I think it's horrible that the industry
does that and that it really does
distort people's minds and what they
think is okay when I ended on a message
of saying I didn't just make this video
for justice for my younger self and then
I fully thought that all the stuff that
happened to me was normal but it's just
just for other girls growing up now if
you're a younger girl start shaping the
way that you want your life to be and
how you want men to treat from a young
age but you can determine what you allow
them to do and who you surround azar
with don't hang out with guys that make
you feel like straight up and boys
don't hang out with girls just to make
them feel like you should want to
hang out people in anything in society
friendship wires or relationship wise
people that lift you up and compliment
you and make you feel good and support
you through whatever and I'm just at a
point now where I'm like people start
actually acting like human beings and
being people again and stop just trying
to conform and fit in I'm not angry
about it I'm just I don't want to see it
happening anymore it honestly breaks my
heart because it doesn't need to be
happening people just need to get more
aware and more educated about this stuff
now isn't enough with the sexualization
of women and the objectification
and I'm going to end on note as well
saying this is not a personal attack to
boys and I know some of you guys want
summe like I've never done any of this
like I I take girls out and I'm not
stuff but it's it's not it's not aimed
that's a broad spectrum you can probably
understand like where I'm coming from
maybe some of you may not be able to
understand where I'm coming from because
as I said this is personal to my life
and how I've grown up that for yourself
stand up for your friends be kind to
yourself and know that just because
someone made quite a bit about you
doesn't mean you have to change like I'm
sick of this thing that people have put
into girls minds that that's what they
have to strive for it seems like we're
always striving to be something better
than what we already are like isn't that
messed up do me and yourself and your
friends and other girls a favor if you
got time from this video please share it
like share this message let's get the
word out there about what's going on I
love you guys so much I hope this video
may have helped some of you it's
definitely helped me being able to
finally speak out about it because this
is stuff from my childhood and my
teenagers I've bottled in for such a
long time and it's what I thought was
normal back then now I definitely
understand it's not normal it's not how
people should be treated so yes I'm
going to stop rambling now I'm sorry
this video is a bit long but yeah don't
forget to subscribe to my channel I'll
be posting many more videos like this
soon um yeah
