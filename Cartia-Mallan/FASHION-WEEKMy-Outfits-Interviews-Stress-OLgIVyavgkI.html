today so I've been up like two hours now
going through everything in my suitcase
to try and put together an outfit I have
some clothes from Zhivago but that shows
tonight and the clothes are very like I
don't know like there's a curse Kurt
that's like really cut out and I'm like
I just don't feel comfortable like doing
the interviews and then just like
walking around all day and I kind of
want to be in something a little more
comfortable a bit more casual I just
don't have anything like I've literally
just didn't pack anything /
arrange any clothes so this so I'm kind
of stressed I don't like doing stressed
it's so weird
stress is literally so bad for your body
last night I was so stressed out about
this outfit thing that's my stomach
after I ate it just loaded up so badly
to make sure I get tamanna
fifteen minutes of meditation in this
morning because I don't have anything to
stress about I just like I hate the
build-up of like events like this that
you have to like be really perfectly
structured and dress--i

I'm wearing clothing that really
represents me and the stuff I have right
now just isn't working but I'm praying
for a miracle
