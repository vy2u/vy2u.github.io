guys doing I am finally back in
Australia if you don't know or you're
new to my channel I've just been in LA
for the past five weeks I think it's
been and finally back home remember obey
and today I'm going to be filming a
little kind of like a festival theme
tour video if you guys because if you
live in Australia right now we are
currently on the lead up for splendour
in the Grass festival and I'm getting
all of my like festival gear together
and ready right now and so I have a lot
of clothes like I'm staring in and I'm
like oh my god I got a lot of stuff to
show you guys I have a whole heap of new
clothes from princess Polly I have a
whole heap of jewelry I have a whole
heap of vintage clothes that I got from
New York and LA and I wanted to do a big
vintage clothing haul but I wanted to I
thought it might be more fitting just to
do like a kind of like festival theme
tour video for you guys and earlier I
just sort of be really fun to show you
guys all the new goodies that I've got I
don't know I'm just like want to say
quick hey again I missed you guys I'm
sitting down throwing um I'm so excited
for Splenda like I can't even contain my
excitement and for this whole video I'm
going to do it a little bit differently
just saying as I have so much stuff to
show you guys I'm just going to speak to
you in this part and then I'm just
literally just going to try on all the
pose with music behind them just so you
can kind of save them on I'm going to
start out with all my products from
princess Polly um I swear to god you
guys are probably like oh my god more
princess wise up again but I like they
just make my go here I always find good
stuff and first blender they always just
have really good essentials where I show
you the stuff that I got um I just want
to mention I have a little discount code
as always for princess Polly and that is
just love cardia and you can get 20% off
their site so if you want to get stopped
the splendor I would say Auto like if
you see something like quickly because
they have really fast express shipping
anyway
so it should come to you very quickly
before Splenda
well you can art - hey buddy what I
supposed to do give it up to you
maybe I mean I suppose
-
for - um baby bird told you that on my
own
they told you that I told you that
okay so that was all my good stuff from
princess Polly and now I'm going to show
you guys some really beautiful jewelry
some of the stuff that I'm already
wearing right now from native Raya is a
beautiful little brand that is based in
Bowen and loves the owner is such a
sweetheart and she's given me some
jewels 2 rakats planner and I love these
pieces these are like honestly so
incredible and so beautiful and she had
made all the pieces and I think she has
perfect stuff for festivals and he would
just daily wear and I am I love like
hearing all of us stuff and some of the
Rings
ha
and finally for some more clothes I'm
just going to show you guys all of but
some of the vintage and thrifted pieces
that I picked up in America that I think
would be good for festivals
- hey local I knew that is all the
products I have to show you today thank
you guys so much for watching if you're
going to splendor I hope you have the
best time ever I'm so excited
make sure you like look warm clothes
gumboots lots of glitter make sure you
stay safe and look after your friends
and just have the best time and just
live in the moment and just enjoy the
music and yeah hopefully I will be able
to meet some of you guys there I'm
currently trying to organize that
I'll possibly have a meet-up for an hour
somewhere that I can just I'll probably
post on my snapchat where I'm gonna be
choosing a spot and have a meet-up so
you guys can come and say hey we can
because I know I've been getting so many
messages from people saying that they
want to come and say hey but I want to
try and like condense it to one moment
that we can do it all together so I
actually have a chance to properly speak
to you guys and meet you because it can
be really stressful um I guess just for
me I I never want you guys to feel like
you can't come and say hey to me but
when I'm at a festival and I'm with a
group of my friends I feel really bad
that every time someone comes up to say
hey I love meeting you guys but then it
like stops all of my friends and they
always have to wait for me and I just
like it's really frustrating for them
and sometimes in the past at festivals
people have been really rude to my
friends kind of pushed them to the side
to try and get to me and I just don't I
don't really like that I don't really
want to have to go through that at
splinter again because it just made me
like really upset that my friends had to
have that happen it just caused a whole
heap of drama so I'm going to try and
have a meet-up so then if anyone wants
to come and get photos and say hey we
can do it all at once and get it done
and then if you see me throughout the
festival you can say hey and we can keep
going on because as you know if you're
into a festival there's a lot of
walking-around have to walk from one gig
to another to another and like it's so
hard when I have to stop south stops up
but um hope you guys can understand it's
just I love festivals and I love
enjoying them as much as you guys
probably do but I'm just like a normal
like everyone else but my number one
purpose is just to enjoy myself not to
just be there to take photos with
everyone but always come and say hey
like I'm never like not gonna like have
a conversation with you guys but I just
yeah I just hit cause drama groovin the
Moo a little bit so I just don't want
that to happen again I hope you guys
understand it has nothing personal it's
not like I don't get photo it's nothing
like that but if you've been to a music
festival
you need to understand that it's like
hectic walk around arrow so many people
around you hopefully and meetup will be
better anyways and then you guys can
kind of mingle with each other too and
yeah be really good fun so I will keep
you posted on the information for that
probably on the first day of the
festival and yes that's a Friday yeah
that's what I have to say so don't
forget to subscribe to my channel leave
any video requests down below for stuff
that you want to see I will be filming a
slender for everyone that was wandering
I'm going and buying a new vlogging
camera tomorrow because my one is just
tragic and it broke and it's just it's
just horrible so we had a new volume
camera and be filming lots of stuff the
splendor don't forget to add me on
snapchat to keep up with all of my pre
festival snaps you'll see my outfits and
