you how I got this really smoky kind of
sultry I'm a full makeup look these are
for all of my viewers who are currently
um I don't know if you guys are going
into fall or in fall or you're going
into winter the opposite to what we're
doing here I'm going into summer at the
moment or in spring this makeup look is
really brown and smoky on the eyes it's
pretty simple it's only just a few brown
shade think this is a really awesome
makeup look for you know kind of like a
9 out or something you can definitely
turn it down or turn it up a lot more
like you can add lashes or a darker lip
color so if you want to see how I got
this makeup look then please keep
watching so today I'll be starting off
my eyes first I'm taking my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot to prime my eyes now
this let us help all the eyeshadow go on
and stay on for much longer then I'm
going to be taking a light brown color
from my Too Faced natural eye palette
and it's called Velvet Revolver
and I'm just lightly buffing this into
my crease of my eye just to kind of
start using it as a transition shade
then I'll be taking a darker brown shade
from my chichi bronzes palette and I'll
just be patting this all over my lid I
didn't think that my camera was bright
enough so I quickly switched on my light
so that's why there's a bit of a
dramatic lighting change now make sure
that between every step you blend these
colors together so they seamlessly run
into each other and make it look really
nice and you know then taking this saucy
sex spresso color I will be patting this
onto the outer V of my eye to once again
darken it up and make sure once you've
done this you blend it all out now with
a slightly cleaner blending brush I'm
taking this kind of shimmery orange tone
color and really lightly applying this
just over that first light brown color
that we added now this will just really
add another bit of like depth into the
look and it will make it kind of have
that like full edgy kind of
oranjee Tony of that makes sense I just
think it looks really nice and it
complements the colors really well then
with that same orange and that light
brown just sweep this underneath your
lash line end up with this light shimmer
shade from the Chiti at bronzes palette
again I will be highlighting my brow
bone then taking my felt tip liquid
eyeliner I will just be lighting my eyes
and I'll be winging it out at the end
finally taking my Maybelline mascara and
my Jordana mascara I will be applying
these two onto my lashes to really give
them lots of volume and pump them up a
lot don't forget to apply it on your
bottom lashes too then for my face I
will be priming at my skin to make the
foundation go on a lot easier and I'll
be taking my makeup forever HD
foundation on my Sigma flat top kabuki
brush and just buffing this into my skin
to highlight under my eyes I'm taking my
Mac Pro Longwear can sit concealer and
I'm taking this on my Sigma tapered
blending brush I think that's one it is
just to buff this into my skin as well
because I think it leaves a really nice
finish
this is literally a classic of me Mara
kept snapchatting me while I was filming
I just had to reply gorgeous Sophie
right back to the makeup I'm taking my
studio fix arm pressed powder foundation
and just setting all of the makeup then
I off camera I put in my eyebrows and
now I am contouring my cheeks with my
NARS Casino bronzer I also just like to
blend this up onto my forehead and
underneath my chin as well most
importantly don't forget to blend it all
together so that there's no weird lines
on your neck then with this light pinky
toned blush I will be applying this onto
my cheeks and also blending it up onto
those high points of my cheeks where we
put like just like above where we put
the bronzer then with my Mac soft and
gentle highlighter I'm touching a little
bit on where we put the blush on my
Cupid's bow the bridge of my nose and a
little bit on my forehead then for
lipstick I'm taking the chichi lipstick
and applying it all over my lips and I'm
sorry this bit was kind of out of focus
this lipstick is literally so nice and
soft and buttery I'm obsessed with it
here so this is the final makeup look I
