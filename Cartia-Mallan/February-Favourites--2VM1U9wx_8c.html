guys my February favorites now I have
collected quite a lot of favorites this
month I want to show you stuff that's a
little bit different so I'm not so much
makeup based at all more more or less
accessory based I've got a bit of
skincare and some apps that I've been
loving and lots of bags as usual all the
links for these products will be left
down below and let's just get started
with this video sign up with two of my
favorite apps this month the first being
the app the hunt and you guys would have
heard me speak about the hunt before I
am an avid user of the hunt a lot of you
guys actually follow me on there because
I often do post punts trying to get you
guys to help me fun and stuff and I just
love scrolling through the hunt feed if
you guys don't know what the hunt is
it's pretty much just an app where like
people post photos they see a fight on
tumblr and you really love the outfit
post it on there to say like I did
anyone know where to find these pants or
this top or this whole outfit and you
can put like a price range for like what
you want and it's so cool because all
these people will just come in and
comment stuff that's really great when
you're kind of like I need to find an
outfit oh my gosh
and they also have like random cool
stuff like I found this under what a
speak is one time that like float in
your pool and I think I could do with
that take them to the waterfall like
swimming around in the waterfall you
just got like floating speakers hanging
about I think that app you can get it on
it definitely comes an iPhone
pretty sure you can get on Android too
so it's just the hunt and I've been
using the hunt for ages but this month
especially I have been obsessing over it
it is to die for I love and you know how
some of those um like some of those apps
where it's kind of similar to the hunt
they're so hard to use the hunt is
actually simple and people who are
technologically disabled like me
can actually navigate it and the next
app that I am obsessed with at the
moment is this one called vsco cam you
guys have been asking me all over again
like can you do another how you edit
your photos and literally I just use
vsco cam it is amazing it comes with
really different looking effects you
wanted me to talk about more about vsco
cam or like more about how at which
edits are using the stuff I'll leave the
link to my what's on my iPhone video
because nothing has really changed it's
all pretty much the same those are my
two favorite apps for this month moving
on to my next thing the next product
that I have been obsessed with this
month I put it all back in its box to
make it look nice to show you guys but
at the young it's the very good spin for
perfect skin and this reminds me of
what's that brush the Clarisonic it
reminds me kind of of the Clarisonic
place Leonardo's like to do stuff but
I'm kind of skeptical about the
Clarisonic cuz I've heard lots of mixed
views and I don't know I don't really
trust it but I've been looking for one
of these little brushes like this too
for ages and then I finally found one
and you have attachable clips to it so
it comes with like a bigger one for your
body which is awesome for exfoliating
off fake tan and before you put on fake
tan that's what I like to use this one
for and you've also got this one you've
got another one of those on I think this
one's like a bit rougher or something
and then you've got a really good little
exfoliator watch my face and then I'll
put on like a lighter cleanser and I'll
rub all of my purse with this and it
actually gets all that excess makeup off
because when you're just using a makeup
remover wipe it's not really taking
everything off all together so I love
going with this and just scrubbing it
all up and same with other sort of the
bigger body one it's so nice because it
really cleans properly and all you need
for this is that you open the bottom and
you just need four double A batteries so
really easy to use and it really pretty
and I'm obsessed I do have some coupon
codes if you guys want to pick up the
spin for perfect skin for a little bit
cheaper very happy it is stumbled into
my
I'm gonna leave my coats for the brush
down below my perfume payment for this
month is to die for
I picked this up when I was in France
it's black opium by Yves Saint Laurent
and I thought this from Sephora when I
was in Paris and it was quite pricey I
remember how much it was in Euros but I
was kind of like Yolo I'm just gonna
spend on the money because I'm an idiot
but it just looks like this I got the
medium-sized spray and I my gosh I've
already gone through so much I didn't
realize it is to die for it's this it
smells like it's sweet and it's very
classy and elegant but still fun and
girly it's just it's my perfect scent
Klout I really like sweet smells and oh
I just I can't I'm gonna cry once that's
right now I'll probably have to invest
in some more my next favorite this month
is my Bellamy hair extensions bit
naughty I just took them out before look
how long they are these are the 24 inch
I have no idea what color don't Brown I
don't know but they're perfect match my
hair car I've been wearing these when
should I get them I think probably like
about a month ago so I've been wearing
them for a month I do still need to get
them cut into my head just because
they're a little too long for me because
I'm so short but you guys know I use
heaps of clip in hair extensions before
I got my Bellamy's I've heard a lot of
mixed reviews from people saying that
they lost their softness really quickly
and they were hard to manage and stuff
but so far - honestly been a dream they
haven't been bad at all they're still so
super soft after quite a while of
wearing them and lots of straightening
lots of curling on them so they've been
great that clamps are awesome they stick
into your hair and they do not move
along with the hair extensions I also
ordered a few other goodies I also
ordered the oh I can see myself in the
nurse it like was like a distorted image
of myself
hello ordered the detangler brush and I
am obsessed with this brush it is so
nice it gets out all of the knot and you
know how some brushes are really rough
on your hair like they really tug this
is so smooth it just glides straight
through your hair I also got the Bellamy
six and one interchangeable curling set
now I was never really a fan of curling
ones and like sets and stuff just
because I did prefer to call my hair
with my hair straight now
because I find like it's a lot easier
but I've been using this a lot more with
curling because I find that since you do
have like six different barrels you can
really achieve like the size of Co you
want it's going to turn out more
reliable then sometimes I do it with my
hair straightener it's you never really
know what you're gonna get
I have everything in here at the moment
cuz my curl is in the bathroom I used it
yesterday but it comes in five to
college on here the big the fattest
barrel and then the next size net size
exercise and there's always that funny
one that looks like a dildo I think we
were all thinking it you guys probably
meant in term you would have seen me
rave about this one
this bag cake was it and oh my god I
love it and it comes in so many
beautiful colors I've seen lots of
different people have like really bright
pink ones green blues blacks yellow I
just wanted to go for this yellow
because I think it's something different
it adds a pop of color to any app that
you put it with they're all handmade and
the detailing on them is so beautiful I
next time with this amazing clutch from
pinko Boheme and the brand of this
clutch is Camilla and but panko does
stop lots of Camilla in their store this
is such an amazing clutch it is quite
massive but I like that because whenever
I go out I am like this type of person
that needs to bring like a whole
freaking room like I bring my makeup
I've got my deodorant a perfume spray my
house keys my lipsticks my everything my
hairbrush that any bath
my favorite thing about this clutch is
the detailing on the zips is like a
gullible and then to like crystal blue
balls with this amazing God detail in
that yellow pom-pom simple but not
simple because it's crazy but I love
pairing this with another print like you
may have seen one of my photos on
Instagram I wore this with a full
leopard print play suit I just think
clashing we're not clashing but mixing
two big prints here that ends up looking
awesome and I also paired it with this
necklace which is my next favorite and I
just love it
moving on my next favorite then little
later on it's incredible necklace it's
also from whitefox boutique I am
obsessed with like statement pieces of
jewelry and everything and this is just
really beautiful to pair it with
absolutely anything and it's just adds
like before move to your kind of outfit
next time favorites I've got two pairs
of Sonny's um if you guys know me you'll
know that I mean ridiculously obsessive
Sonny this is my first pair of an
obsessed with they're very different
they have lurid selective screens and
they've got little cute palm trees up in
each corner I look kind of like a baby
head right now with all this stuff on
but that's so cool I reckon they're big
statement pieces and Sonny's and they
are from dish brew tea they are I don't
know why I love them so much that is
kind of really cool and vintage e and
they go with every single outfit because
I've just finished the basic kind of
colors and tones and stuff and I'm just
obsessed so those are all my favorites
for the month of February I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I hope you
all have a wonderful week and a fabulous
day and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
