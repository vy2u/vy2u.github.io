going to be doing a question dance video
I'm going to be answering the questions
you guys asked me on Instagram and we've
let's talk about I haven't done one of
these in quite some time they were on my
bed I wrote my plan too long just to
make it look a little bit nicer a little
pillow arrangement back here let's just
try and not make this too long and
John's really tight first question is
what's the biggest thing you've learnt
since moving out I don't know I've
learned a lot mostly you learn a lot
about yourself and what you can head on
we can do it and you also learn little
things like how to actually be an adult
kind of like washing and cleaning and
watering plants actually in order to
live I'm not doing so good at it anyways
I also think that you learn how to
become really independent and that you
actually have to do a lot to kind of
live I guess and I've definitely learned
how to save my money a lot better I've
definitely gotten a whole lot more
independence about myself as well since
moving out alone because I think people
underestimate the fact that like I know
I think that people kind of just think
moving out by yourself is easy it's
definitely not easy
I guess if you're with the right people
and you're moving out friends and it
could be potentially a lot easier but
when you're moving out by yourself it is
quite a struggle because it's something
completely different especially for me
at such a young age I've never really
experienced anything like living alone
or without like the stability of like a
parent figure that kind of thing even
though like I did travel quite a bit
when I was younger to do so it's just
really learn a lot more about yourself
and what you can cope with and how to
cope with it because you literally have
to figure out ways to cope with
different things if I can recommend
anything moving out hands down best
thing I've done it's also a little bit
second question is what are your goals
for 2016 at first if you had asked me in
January what my goals were they would
have been like all I just want to like
create more content and just make more
videos and just be working more kind of
thing and now that I've I've moved down
and living myself my girls are
definitely changed I think they're more
centered around myself and my own growth
and obviously my growth with my work
stuff and but it's mainly I'm realizing
that this is kind of the year for me
like I have to take time out to get to
know me and get to love me and get to
treat me to what I deserve to be doing
because I feel like in society these
days the last person we look after is
also and I kind of taught that it's a
bad thing to be looking out for
ourselves and learning how to love
ourselves because I think that so many
people don't know how to start to like
themselves I don't think that I'm ever
going to be able to be as successful as
I want to be if I don't love myself
enough I need to be able to have myself
if like just fails and everything
ends up horribly and Who am I
with it you know like this you know
mainly just I want to try and like get
up there more and experience more and
learn more about myself and find ways
that I can cope with all sorts of
different emotions and feelings and
through that I think I'll just probably
attract more people that I want in my
life
I'll track more love in my life I'll
attract more tivity in my life and I
just think it attracts so much more
positive stuff once you start really
going into learning rates up and it's
not some deep like I'm gonna like spend
all this time on me like I think it's
just awakening your consciousness a
little bit more to be tapping into and
being like oh what can I learn from that
it's not just happening with that like
how does that affect me how do I feel
how do I deal with that way can I move
on from that in a sense I also want to
travel more and I definitely collaborate
with people more and throw more
festivals make more festival films and
just I guess putting in more effort with
all the videos that I'm making now and
it's good then I'm like full-time doing
this now because I have the ability to
do that
there's no excuses if I don't do it so
2018 so far has been very fun and it's
been a very big wake-up call and
experience
everyone says it was like this is going
to be good and I'm like kids I feel that
to that question is how do you take your
photos um I just take my photos
literally on all sorts of different
things sometimes on my phone sometimes
on the camera I'm filming on which is a
Canon 70d and sometimes on film cameras
and
yeah when I take it on my big camera I
just use flash I just find that that
helps the photo quality when I do it and
then on my phone just making sure
there's good lighting pretty much how to
low-key flirt um like just kind of I
think it's just about like being
persistent in a conversation maybe like
really having eye contact and just being
like oh and having like interest slowly
kind of just like putting a little bit
of like a hahahaha like not Janette sort
of thing like creeped in there and just
been some and that doesn't make any
sense just be yourself and um it
make a move why low-key flirt Heike
flirt make that happen position is
are you going to get with any more
tattoos and I like 100 does not want to
get more tattoos I think once I kind of
got this one now I'm just like there's
so many in my mind that I do really want
to get and I'm just kind of unsure yeah
order to show that like placement ups to
where I want them but I at the moment
like I know I want to get more I'm just
like not a hundred essential I'm like
what is exactly that I want so once I
know exactly what I wanted what I'm like
super drawn to getting that I'll get it
I've been getting asked this question
that's so much everyone's asking me what
editing software I use to edit my videos
and I use Final Cut Pro it was up to me
I'd be using Premiere Pro just because
editing is like my thing I love editing
like cool things and stuff and more
stuff in Final Cut that you can on
iMovie but then premieres like the next
step but just since I'm like turning
over two videos a week and I need to be
like quickly editing I find Final Cut
the easiest and you can still like Ultra
effects and just you need to get
creative within and like experiment
beyond the preset ones because you can
adjust everything which is good but you
just need to like test it out a bit more
and see how you go okay there's like
four of the same question in a row how
do you stay positive when you're
surrounded by negative energy how to
deal with negative people and how do you
let them go how do you block a relevant
fall to negative negativity okay so it's
all kind of surrounding like looking at
negativity alright so I definitely get
asked this question quite a lot because
you guys obviously see that I'm a rather
upbeat and happy person most of the time
it's something that is super hard to do
when
you're faced with negative energy from
people can sometime just seep into you
and you're like oh how do I deal with
this is weird
and also negative comments from people
and stuff sometimes they can just get
inside me and tight you so badly and it
hurts and you just don't want that
feeling and no one ever once is like
that so ways to handle it and how I deal
with it and it's set up so most of the
time when I get a negative comment from
someone but it's like take a moment to
sit and like breathe and just think you
just have to it comes up to just knowing
yourself and having enough love for
yourself that you can move past it you
have to be like hey you're
awesome in your own way just because
this person doesn't get it doesn't take
anything away from the fact of who you
are and this is the person you are you
you're you you can't change me while
like you can obviously weapon yourself
but you're never going to be someone
else
so is it do one of two things I like
they're just taking over by myself
comment I'm room light a candle lights
and incense
just have a shower relax watch a movie
or just write something or do something
I enjoy and just chill and just like
really listen to the music and just have
to myself just to cheer myself up and
try and tell myself as affirmations like
you're wonderful you have done like I
try and like pick out the positives
about myself and might make myself feel
a bit better and know that it's not
egotistical you're allowed to
pick out things that you like about
yourself and tell yourself how you did
that you've done that you'll guess
you're stunning
love it love it that's you and like
simply sometimes I might find myself in
like god I wish I was more like that
than like wall oh my golly you're never
going to be like that you're not going
to be that person this is you so what
can you work with and then another thing
that I might do if there's something
really just like infuriating me and I
feel like I just need a wick fuller to
someone I'll call it friend and be like
hey I really need a chat or I'll go to a
friend's place and just sit and just
everything out so I guess I'm really
lucky because one of my friends are
pretty with it and they give really good
advice or third option and I'll start
crying on first time two years and just
feel it Kelsey and she just talks me
through this we're up front way just
don't take from people just be you
and stay strong about it like I don't
care what you have to say I'm me and I'm
rotten
so and always remember most the time
someone's giving you hate they're only
jealous so was your mom mad about your
tattoo since you're so young um
at first she was like don't get a tattoo
it's bad because you might not get
booked for certain things and like I
think there's definitely just in society
people like I made with tattoos so bad
and I think that kind of push me to do
it even more because I just like I just
kind of like to um not necessarily
conform with what society thinks is
correct because I think it's a load of
 and if a company really likes
me for me then whatever's on my skin
shouldn't affect that so yeah fo she was
a little bit like I guess just being a
mom and like caring me because she wants
me to succeed obviously but then when
she found out the reasoning as to what
the tattoo actual stands for um she
couldn't be mad because her and I think
she's chill with it now obviously well
it's not coming off my CV anytime soon
how did you get so confident any advice
oh there's quite a story to this I'm
definitely a very confident person still
so many things I'm really not that
confident I mean you guys see me in
videos and I guess welcome of you make
me you can see I'm pretty confident to
approach people and like to speak but I
definitely do deal with quite a lot of
insecurities still and I'm like everyone
does and obviously like I try not let
that affect me too much but I think I'm
as confident as I am now today I've
never always been this confident
like quite a period time I was bullied
pretty badly and lack confidence and my
self consciousness was extremely low I'm
gonna say now because I got sick of
having to miss out on things because I
was too scared or too nervous or too
self-conscious to go somewhere or wet
something or anything it literally just
got to a point where I was like I'm so
sick of this and - kinda has this like
pocket streak where I was like if these
people don't like me and if they want to
think negatively about me I honestly
don't care because I'd rather that then
be living this life that I'm living now
and it just wasn't fun to me I was
always living in my head and also
worried about what everyone thought
about me and I was like why should i as
confidence takes time and is definitely
processed you can sometimes get into a
bit of a proverb and when you throw
they're self-conscious but you really do
have to remind yourself of the positives
in yourself and as I said society tells
you that it's a bad thing to do that
it's definitely not a bad thing it is
probably one of the best things because
if you're confident in yourself you have
the ability to then inspire and help
other people which is really what leads
right now
because instead of everyone bringing
each other down you can always look to
each other up and then if I kind of
start going on around her life itself
I'm like am I making any sense is this
making sense do you guys understand I
don't know Oh clinging to I think my SD
cards almost completely full now so I'm
going to stop talking because I am way
too mad I hope you guys enjoy this sort
