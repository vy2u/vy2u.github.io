to eat so looks like we're gonna go eat
I'm gonna stay in my work hockey because

when I start working out I get into it I
get like become like fitness freak girl
and if I don't do it like if I've been
exercising and then by just all of a
sudden kind of stop then I'm gonna get
angry at myself and I start feeling
sluggish so yeah I'm just getting into

hello my friends on the Internet I am
absolutely dead um it's 12 o'clock I
woke up like two hours ago
I've just been chilling like I'm so
tired I woke up pretty hungover and also
um I woke up with a snapchat story of me
crying no I wasn't that drunk that I
like forgot that I did I just like woke
up and was like oh yeah that's right um
that was really really fun um flume was
amazing um when I came home
I was like literally a crying mess I was
on FaceTime Diaz and I was like yeah
then I also was brother frustrated
because I got into like a heated
conversation with like it was like
Georgie Vince my friend and and I were
like all kind of talking about the idea
of like the reason behind life and why
we live in something I think I love
hearing like old people's like point of
views on stuff and like it was really
interesting listening to Vince talk
about his take on it who's for someone
that's a musician in the industry kind
of thing like I have lots of musician
friends and I find it really interesting
talking to them because their job is so
strange and it's like they have to give
so much of themselves and I'm yeah it
was interesting to hear his point of
view imitations like I get really into
it with that sort of stuff especially
like we we had a different point of view
about it and I was literally just like
getting pretty frustrated at him like
what do you mean like how do you say
this stuff and it's like it's not bad
thing it's just his point of view it's
it's more like I'm not making any sense
but it's not centered around like I have
a view that my purpose I feel like my
purpose is to like help other people and
make other people happy and make myself
happy and live a positive life and his
was more kind of just like very
existentialist and I just that
frustrates me because I'm like but I
know that being positive has helped my
life but like like still all in all
everyone has their like method behind
the way that they live behind what they
think and he has an awesome musician or
some guy so yeah it was just it was just
interesting to hear like we were all
like all for those times I was actually
talking but all just like rebuttal
embarking forth well roams in the green
room drinking in the well just they're
having like big life talks so so today
guys I've literally just been having the
laziest days of my life not lazy like
I'm productive so I'm getting work done
but I'm just enjoying like chilling the
Frick out because normally I'm always
like go go go go go
I'm always very social and I mean I've
been really social but I'm just trying
to have some chill time and I'm loving
it
it's going to make some lunch soon I'm
sort of making a big salad I think and
then I'm going to do some more editing I
really want to try and do some writing
today because I haven't been writing
very much lately because I mean as I as
I say I've been having children I might
also have been like busy doing stuff too
but I've had time to like sit on write
and um and that's all that's going on
I've just been like really happy so I'm
like I'm not being a dramatic sad girl
so I don't really have like much to
really write it's like I write the most
when I'm like really like into a
situation or something and I'm like so
dramatic like some of the stuff I write
I'm going to be like you're such a
dramatic sad girl cardia like get a grip
but it's fun
I ordered the poetry book milk and honey
and I'm so excited to get it and my
friend ez also wrote a poetry book and
they're they're writings like really
similar and I'm really excited to read
back so I love stuff like milk and honey
it's like that's what I like most
connect with but I'm super hungry so I'm
going to make some lunch um I just kind
of grabbed out a whole heap of
ingredients are from the fridge I'm just
thinking of doing a big salad like I
said like lots of veggies I feel a
little like I Division I recently got
this stuff like I never ever buy fake
meats or anything this is the first time
I've ever bought fake me so I'm going to
give this a go some broccoli mushrooms
some salad hummus I have a sauerkraut
kimchi I'm just going to put some I'm
not having that
please into a bowl
nice to prepare I literally just put
some water in the bowl and then I put it
straight into the microwave I hate this
I hate packaged veggies basic don't know
like any markets around here that I can
go buy grocery items like lychee this
looks so dried out and love problems or
my favorite and you've got your veggies
and just like move to the side and put
some salad
they say this stuff is washed I like
always make sure to wash it wash it
again pop in the salad how do I cook
these things you know that does not look
pleasant at all we'll give it a whirl a
little bit of avocado karma I also just
put some kimchi sauerkraut guys I really
do mix so much random food together but
I just love like and this house potato
personally I need to have a bit of
everything I need every single flavor I
want to have it all and I'm also putting
home ice on top and okay so I took the
fake chicken out of the UM out of the
packet I've just put it on the pan and I
only put like a few of them because they
do not look appetizing like they smell
really freaking weird I never normally
cook with like fake meats just because
there's so process I just like hate
processed food if it freaked me out and
like it's just I always feel gross if I
eat it so I always just try and strip
your veggies and stuff but I was like
you know what you don't expand your
world so this is it I'm nervous to try
this stuff and I'm just going to put
some lemon salt and pepper and some
sriracha I told you guys I literally
like every single flavor possible the
fake chicken is not as bad as what I
expected but let's be real light
honestly never go and buy it again I'm
just gonna eat this and keep editing
okay so I've just woken up I woke up
like half an hour ago and I've just been
laying but I cannot get up I'm so tired
I forgot to keep filming yesterday but
pretty much I just um uploaded a video
so I was just replying to comments and
all that stuff but now I'm just going to
get myself dressed and then go for a
walk
um weather is so beautiful today day of
work I'm going to try and film two
videos and I also have my couch being
delivered today and another person
coming to fix something I'm not sure so
I pretty much just have to stay at home
and wait for all these um people to come
so that is what is going on and his walk
is gonna be interesting
okay we keep my eyes open this is
ridiculous I literally like death so I
just got back from my walk and literally
as I walked inside my doorbell rang and
I got a delivery I remembered that house
of CB was sending me um some like New
Year's dresses tight body con dresses
and like I don't ever normally go out of
my way to ever buy dresses like this I
don't normally wear stuff like this but
that's only because I lived in a beach
town for you and you just there was
never anything to really dress up for
and I've always kind of been like more
of like a pants and my top sort of
person but I really want to try and
branch more into like different styles
and stuff guys like a sneak peek of um
of like the prints and stuff so I have a
white one with this print you'll see it
later I have well that's kind of like a
giveaway of that one how cute is the top
it'll just look really really nice oh my
God look at this oh okay so I've just
finished getting ready and now I'm about
to just set my camera and film a little
like make up a whole beauty product haul
video praying that the delivery guy
doesn't buzz I'm like halfway through
filming like go downstairs all dressed
up like this he's like what are you
doing like chill out woman okay so oh my
god whoa
I've just been something's like 40
minutes and I have to close all of the
like stuff in my room it is hot this is
what I look forward to most once I
finished filming is
to open a window and also eat I'm about
to go make a bomb-ass lunch
as we were successful no delivery then
while I was filming don't know what to
make may be another salad or sweet
potato or there's so many yummy options
okay so filming is done I've cleaned up
a little bit she like a little tripod
fit in here actually let me go grab I've
got a mini tripod I can use
I don't know why just ran that was so
unnecessary where is this tripod it
thought I had one we're on earth why do
I lose everyone from my face good job I
found it really fun just adding these
into the vlog so I can show you guys
like what I eat most asked questions
amazing so what do you eat I'm like a
got a law a lot of different stuff and
it feel like some veggies again just
because I woke up this morning and
literally couldn't get out of bed so I
think I'm a little bit a deficient I'm
not really a huge fan of taking iron
tablets they just don't really process
very well in my body yeah just trying to
avoid that at all time so instead I just
know I try and stock up on more veggies
let's see what I can do don't know what
I do is I'll just grab out like a whole
heap of random ingredients from the
fridge and just see what I feel like and
just always end up making bowls like the
one yesterday I just like mixing all
different sorts of things salad so it's
got like carrots cabbage spinach I'm
going to cook some asparagus for some
mushrooms have lots trimmed put some
kimchi on top maybe some chickpeas and
stuff I don't know I'll uh I'll let you
guys know once I decide my ingredients
I'm not exactly sure what I've just
created put the coastal salad some
avocado chickpeas asparagus mushrooms
hummus my classic sriracha on top with
some salt and pepper and some lamb
and so having some turmeric and ginger
kombucha I freaking love turmeric and
ginger and I love kombucha I was really
keen to try this it's really on me okay
so I think you guys get the drill by now
I'm just sitting getting some work done
with my delicious food of course it
turned out wonderfully like I think when
we just makes a whole bunch of stuff and
you add sriracha lemon and some pepper
and hummus and avocado and pays it is it
is always good so yeah I'm just going to
do some work now and then hopefully the
freakin couch are ease up and gets here
like I'm waiting okay so the couch has
arrived here goes cardi are attempting
to create another piece of furniture
again so I'm opening up the couch I
don't know I'm going to show how to do
this 50 down one down oh wait what to do
with the box like Jesus all right so
I've set up the couch we're gonna call
it nice and once I actually properly
decorate this place because nothing at
the moment matches and it's really
frustrating me but we'll get there hello
guys I haven't picked up my camera to
film today because I have been in such a
cranky mood all day it hasn't been
cranky I've just felt very sour I don't
know I know exactly why it's like this
some of you may get this I mean maybe
like what the hell are you talking about
there's a big full moon tomorrow and it
is like a big powerful super moon in
Gemini think it's in Gemini and every
time there's a full moon or new moon or
a retrograde I'm very very affected by
it you're a super spiritual person oh
you're kind of tapped in with all
astrology or you know information about
and stuff you'll kind of understand that
it does affect us humans quite a bit
more than most people would think so
yeah all day I've been very like zomp
doubt of it as you can't I'm pretty like
by June I didn't want to pick up the
camera if I was in a really crappy mood
I just wanted to wait until I got out of
my mood to talk to you guys um so yeah
I've just been editing the vlog and it's
so long sorry about that
I'm loving vlogging in the moments I'm
going to try and vlog quite a bit
mortgage you guys have been loving them
which is really really sweet also you
guys always ask me where I read all my
information about astrology and about
how I find out about all the different
moons and retrogrades
and I have lots of friends and
clairvoyants I have lots of friends that
are like astrologers but the one that I
go to the most is my really good friend
Julia George she has a Facebook page
called home of the heart and I'll leave
it link below she does amazing posts
about all this stuff it always gets a
text for me whenever I start feeling
really weird or ungrounded and I'm like
Julia what's going on and she always
sends me like a big big blurb of
information about it I just want to
quickly talk about before I end this
vlog I'm sorry it's so long I mean you
guys kind of like them long I guess but
if you meant to the end
Congrats that's incredible but I just
want to quickly talk about this so
grateful for our little family is that
you guys are very positive and you don't
you're not quick to judge but I can just
I'm not sure if you're just like that on
my channel or whatever but please be so
like considerate and kind you don't know
what someone's going through you don't
know what happens behind closed doors
when a camera isn't rolling or when when
I when doesn't know photos being taken
or when there's something they're not
explaining every little piece of
information hurts my heart to see people
bullying and like doing this stuff like
do realize when you spread online hate
it's just gonna like come back to you in
a really bad like like comma will come
back and it's just not gonna be nice so
like just guys be nice to each other
don't be so invested in other people's
lives like be more invested in your life
that your life is the most important
life to live so care more about your
life and obviously if you want to care a
lot about someone else's life make sure
it's to spread love and spread like
positivity and something nice instead of
making someone upset like how does it
why I don't just I don't I don't know I
just like I'm I don't understand how it
can feel good to make someone else feel
like like in hope is that we keep
building this little family that is just
people that are supportive and helpful
to each other and I hope you guys know
like within each other if you like watch
my videos or something that you can
hopefully all like in the comments like
if someone has an issue maybe like
comment and someone else can comment
back like user use use my platform is
almost a place to maybe find like-minded
people who are like positive and
connected and all that stuff because I
think that it'd be so nice for you guys
to also become friends and whatnot
because I like I wish I could sit down
and meet you all but it's not I can't so
it would just like make me so happy if
like you guys became like mutual friends
through me like I feel like it's like an
online dating site but like an online
friendship site but anyways just have to
clean my apartment because my baby girl
Rochelle is coming to stay with me for
the next few days so I yawn you clean up
and make the bed in the spare bedroom
