hello guys okay super exciting so I'm
sitting down today
and back on my old camera on my big
camera and I'm a new rain light super
bright and I'm going to be filming and
makeup outfit kind of like the first
impression was kind of like you clothed
like I've got a whole bunch of stuff
going on today pretty much I posted this
photo on Instagram and you guys like
felluci we'd be done got an email from
Vogue and they wanted me to be on this
fun coffee you know stuff got a little
bit crazy when this photo went out so
I'm here to give you guys the look
really joking vogue do not call but feel
free to hit me up I am free all week and
so yeah I'm just going to be well I'm
really cringe let's just jump right into
the makeup artists chat through it with
you guys and keep watching me so the
moment I've been loving using it these
two parts to begin with it is the Marc
Jacobs primer posting it coconut face
primer this stuff it is incredible - so
nice on the skin to get like a nice Jew
aglow as well I have been loving to add
the dewdrops coconut gel highlighter I
just got back my hand together and then
just rub it all over the face oh my god
it feels so beautiful
you're just seeing if I was like rubbing
that row my face lately I've been
obsessed with my Maybelline it dream
cushion and this is a me shade 21 who'd
I do have a bit of fake tan on so I'm
not sure how well it will match but I am
going to put like a little layer of this
on just because it just it like
airbrushing your skin but I've also just
got another new foundation this before
our brightening and hydrating foundation
in the shade medium so I want to try
this out I know you said before so let's
just start with this because this is
pretty like light to medium coverage
and then we can go in with a really
light layer of these before our
foundation oh my god I'm obsessed with
this stuff it feels just so nice and
lightweight on the skin me normally I'd
be completely content escaping into that
and adding concealer but since I'm going
to try out some new products and since
this is a YouTube make a video let's go
in with some more foundation you all
they don't like too much foundation so I
just have like a little baby
amount then try it out oh okay
hello mmm feels a bit funny you're
kidding me
just here that renegade milestones like
playing like a car going home before me
I'm thoroughly confused really
disrespectful please quite and Daniel a
little Ray's going upstairs kind of
pursuer YouTube's premium feel like it
does not do it very well in my face like
it just made all my pores really stand
out and next going with concealer I'm
taking my Rimmel wake me up and this is
honestly this is an OG I've been using
this concealer for years so I just kind
of do this and then I buff it in lightly
set this in place with my mac studio fix
powder I didn't do my brows I'm not
going to talk about it just going to
fill them in because I whoa I find this
step the most boring thing of all
okay oppa do have to say my brows right
now or in need of a wax that's very
thick right now don't let them
intimidate you once my all my makeups
done they will look normal I still live
with these things how do you think I
feel a lot I think I'm just going to
jump into the eyes it's going to be
pretty simple if you ever do tape out
they sent me the whole set look like
other things and I love this eyeshadow
palette literally are the most stunning
colors and I am obsessed with this
really warm almost like barky tone and
brown shades and I'm just going to get
that on a hunting brush and just pop it
on into my crease it's not the best
brush to you whoops actually not then
again I do define like a really diffuse
look because my outfit is already pretty
out there and my skirt that I'm wearing
is like a caramel tie rings and nicely
with the shade on the shirt you can see
what I'm doing I just mentally blend it
but also let it kind of calm down onto
the lid too I really love the one color
just diffused look on eyes okay then
what's near not a lot
I'm very predictable Brown eyeliner as
always I like to make my own very smoky
and sultry
so instead of using black eyeliner I
think Brown brings out my eye color a
bit nicer and makes it right smokey so
pop this on my waterline I'm going to
also distract underneath the lid on the
lash line and I just pack it on I make
it pretty messy like that after but
while I'm doing this I just also like to
add a very thin layer right in the lash
line on the top for a little more
definition of the eye shape then with my
finger I just rubbed that across
so it's kind of blended out and sang
with on the bottom and then with that
same palette I'm trying the really small
brush and getting some more of that
brown shade and put a little bit on down
as well super smoky oh I love all these
columns together you guys can go as Nate
or as much as you want as you can tell I
just I love to look like I've just been
punched in the eye it is my go to look a
nice job a blue color here as well just
like my shirt so I wonder what that
would look like experimenting out of it
oh yes that looks so nice okay I'm happy
with that just one out of my benefit
mascara I started trying out this one by
Madeline and I love is the darkest black
mascara I've ever tried and it's just
you like do not any much of this at all
and yes like I have a few lashes still
stuck on inside as you can tell it's
when I get to the end up having lashes I
just stop necks out of them looks good
it just lengthen lengthen lengthen roll
lengthens them so much I pull them out
of their grave like you wouldn't think I
still had lashes when you go war there
they are
that eyes just grew like three times the
size and then I very carefully put a
tiny bit on the bottom lash line here so
that we have the eyes let's move on to
Mumba and blush so lately I've been
using the Marc Jacobs tantastic bronzed
up with the amazing brush that goes with
it this huge big bronzer brush it's the
softest thing ever and he's going to
give myself a nice overall kind of
tanned look and then I'm going to go in
with a darker shade and define my
collarbone is a little bit more my
collarbone and cheekbones a little bit
more
my oven DK and make it flush pellet I
love this tile just taking and be it
bronze it up in heel on a small brush to
just carve out my cheekbones a little
bit more I might try out the other Urban
Decay palette with this purple shade I
don't know I'm just like let's give it a
try see what it looks like
mmm mmm nice I like this I love really
deep blush shade it's a highlight I
thought I'd try out my new Becca
cosmetics I lied I don't normally like
them super pearly and white like this
we're going to give it a try it is in
the shade cosmetic amethyst cool name
and it is B shimmering skin perfector
but I can might be really intense but C
is so nicely with that blush I actually
love it oh that has got to be a new
favorite that's so pretty okay then for
lips I recently went to a Smashbox event
they gave us the whole collection of
these new lip shades that are coming out
um they are be a legendary liquid
pigments and oh my gosh I am so obsessed
I've been wearing the nude shade that
they have but I just pulled out these
two different colors got a few pigments
and in a but a few metal shades and the
metal shades are so beautiful and then I
don't wear much gloss or gleam like
shimmer on my lips anymore but if I give
it a try but I might play with putting
this one on the base just see what the
color looks like and then putting a
little bit of this over the top oh maybe
a little too big the formula of the
myrrh is just buttery and you need the
tiniest bit to cover the lips as
see you're the fan of the college so I'm
going to really rub it in get a nice
pink base then I'll try some this other
shade on talked about that one was in
the shade pink drank and this is in the
shade petal metal Wow oh my god are you
going to see this
I think used to go well tear them
weirdly I kind of like this is this
weird to the logger gang like other mine
this is the final makeup look like rule
of thumb looks like slimmer I pull my
hair in the photo I had it pulled up
super high and since I've had my hair
extensions taken out I I've been loving
to do a high ponytail because I have the
freedom to do it without stupid tapes I
am I'm just going to get a big hair
brush and brush my hair up or you can
just like make it easy and like flip
your hair forward and then pull it up
and then I just tie it in it but it kind
of just looks like this okay hair makeup
done now I'm gonna jump up whoa ash or
