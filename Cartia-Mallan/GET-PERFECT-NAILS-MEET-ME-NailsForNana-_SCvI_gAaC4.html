incredible meet greet passes this is a
massive opportunity we're giving away so
so many tickets so I hope you guys all
get on board and let's go to painting
nails now so for today I've got my
brand-new Rita Ora Rimmel nail polishes
here now all the colors are gorgeous
this stock isn't actually adding stores
it but i'm sure you can pick it up soon
I'm just taking this gorgeous red color
and before I paint my nails I like to
roll the nail posh instead of shaking it
this helps get air bubbles out and also
helps to stop your nails chipping um too
soon and whatnot if that makes sense so
I'm just going to be taking this nail
polish and what I like to do when it
comes to painting nails is just take it
really slow and do small thin strokes at
a time and now I'm no expert at painting
nails and normally I get it kind of all
over my fingers but what I like to do um
laughter is I go in with my finger tip
of the other hand I just lightly kind of
smooth around the corners I find that
this can help clean it up and stop but
as I was saying best thing to do with
these nail polishes there they have a
really great consistency and the brush
is really amazing it's quite fanned out
and large so you don't need to take too
long and due to many coats so what is
probably the best thing to do is just do
small thin coats and if you do want to
build up the column or wait for it to
dry one time around and then go back
again and do it all time favorite thing
about these nail polishes is that they
dry in 60 seconds it is
absolutely incredible so now that you've
learned the rules for painting nails
it's time for you guys to go crazy and
completely break them I want to see you
