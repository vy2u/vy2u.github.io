want to see how I achieved this whole
look then please keep watching the first
we'll start out with the hair if you
like me normally I've just come home
after a big day of school of work and
I'm feeling pretty gross my hair
normally is looking really really oily
and just not nice so normally if I have
enough time I will just go for and have
a shower and freshen myself up now I'm
going to be just brushing it through my
hair before I style it and I'm putting
in my new me leaving conditioner to get
it all nice and soft then I'm just going
to be using at my nume blow dryer now

u.s. if you use the code love card er
now once I've dried my hair I'm going to
be taking my nume straightener because I
just want to go for a straight look so
I'll be parting my hair into two parts
to make it quicker if you guys don't
want to straighten your hair you could
always just curl it and you can get $100
off any curling wand or set and ten
dollars shipping to the US and after a
Leah from nume and
the codes that is curl ishes so I love
these products this hair straightener is
to die for along with that blow dryer it
is like literally supercharged ride my
hair so quickly I'm going to be pulling
down the second part of my hair and
going along and straightening this part
I'll have all the links and the coupon
codes down below my description box for
you guys to go and check it out once my
hair is feeling nice silky smooth and
straight I'm going to go ahead and start
with my makeup I'm going to start by
prepping my face and my makeup forever
primer and then for my base I'm just
using my L'Oreal perfect match concealer
my - Make Up For Ever HD foundation and
my mac studio fix powder and I'll also
just be filling in my brows with this
essence brow pencil once the base is
done I'm going to be taking my Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot to prep my eyes to help
the eyeshadow stand for longer then as
with this little Rimmel quad I'm taking
a little shimmer tone to put on first
all over the lid to prep it and then
with this like red burgundy Moroni kind
of color I don't know how to explain it
I'm putting this all over the lid - and
then blending it out with a fluffy brush
with my kids I'm Fiesta palette I've
taken these two Browns and I'm just
going to be blending them together
across my crease to give it some
definition
now you once you've built up the color
to how you want it to look just blend it
out again with that little fluffy brush
then taking a pencil eye shadow brush
I'm going to be applying that dark brown
onto my lower lash line then with a just
like dark black eye liner crayon pencil
I'm going to be lining my waterline and
also really just mostly lining my top
lid and then after this I'm going to be
taking the other end of the eye liner
the little smudgy brush and just
blending this out on my lid to give a
kind of like a smokey effect so this is
the eyes done so far then I'm just going
to be pumping up my lashes with some
mascara but after this I will be
applying some eyelashes now this is
optional I just think it adds a lot more
to the look and makes them pop so after
I've done the eyes I'm taking my Naz
bronzer and just contouring my face and
bronzing it up to give it some Alaska's
I was looking pale and then with my balm
in stain blush I'm just going to be
applying this to my cheek I'll be using
my Mac soft and gentle highlighter and
just applying this all over my face and
the places that I want it then for my
lip color I'm using a tantalizing tour I
think that's how you say it just this
really nice new color and I'm just
putting this all over my lips and I'm
putting my covergirl gloss over the top
for some extra shine and this is the
makeup all done now I'll be moving on to
the outfit and all of the details will
be left in the description box so you
