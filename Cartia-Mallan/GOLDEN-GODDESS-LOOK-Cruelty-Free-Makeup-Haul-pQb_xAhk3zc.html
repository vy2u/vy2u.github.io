a makeup tutorial I haven't done one of
these in ages and I'm very very excited
about this one I've kind of named it
like a golden goddess kind of look today
I'm collaborating with a really awesome
brand called I have Horus for the launch
of their new line of Goddess boxes these
boxes kind of like little makeup kits
different eye looks and I want to
explain a little bit about Eye of Horus
first I've Horace's a Byron Bay based
brand so it's in my town where I live
and pretty much the products are
formulated in the sell of ancient
Egyptian so they're pretty much just
used natural oils and waxes they have
kind of like a shadow products eyeliners
brow products mascara but I found with
all the products that has super long
lasting that smudge proof their water
resistance their paraben and cruelty
free and what's really great about these
products is that they are really good
for sensitive eyes like I have really
sensitive eyes of some eye product so
these ones join irritate them at all and
they've been formulated around really
targeting that problem which is really
great the whole range is vegan which is
awesome but the only products are on
vegan in this line and the mascara and
the eye pencil C's contain naturally
derived bee wax so yeah they're the only
ones that on 100% vegan in the line but
they bring out a vegan mascara in
October and also launching a new
lipstick line which is completely vegan
soon as well so that's really awesome so
keeping out for that stuff I'm going to
now go into a little more information
about this beautiful product that we are
kind of featuring today and this is the
new dawn goddess box it's really pretty
packaging is so cool there stuff and I
absolutely love it first three other
boxes with other looks in it and each
box has a mascara a liquid eyeliner
pencil eyeliner and an eye shadow kit
and they also come with a really awesome
little tarot card inside which I'm going
to show you guys so there's this and he
is like take that off and then you have
your little box here also the box comes
with a really awesome necklace and I'll
explain like it's so cool it's like
because it's like getting like
inside the most exciting things in each
of the boxes are $89 each which is
pretty awesome containing what they have
inside I'll show you guys inside we have
a little leaflet which has kind of like
the goddess and they look on it and then
on the back there it shows all the
products that are inside there's a
really awesome custom tarot card which
has different intentions for each box
and I'm going to explain that one is a
little bit but first I'm going to show
you the products inside the most
exciting part so it just looks like this
the packaging is so beautiful and here
all the products so the first product
that we have is just the little
eyeshadow palette there's three baked
eyeshadows in here and you guys will see
how I kind of use these in the makeup
look I love these colors I just look so
beautiful and so glowy and really really
great pigment next thing we have the
mascara and you want them it just looks
like this the liquid eyeliner and I am
also obsessed with this is the coolest
but then I'm using this one for some
upcoming festivals and stuff it just
looks like this and it is like a bronzy
liquid eyeliner and it just looks so
beautiful and the last makeup product in
the box is just the pencil eyeliner and
I'm obsessed with brown eyeliner I don't
really use black eyeliner anymore
besides for like winged eyeliner but on
the end of this has also like a little
smudge also what they have in the box
is this really awesome custom necklace
which comes with the dawn and goddess
box but also for all the other eye
makeup look boxes they all have their
own individual necklace which I think
it's so beautiful
no piece that I absolutely think is just
the icing on the cake face box which I
have so they love is the fact that
there's like a little costume tarot card
in here which also links up with the
necklace that you have so it kind of
just explains the tension of the card
and kind of the goddess that represents
the box and I think it's really nice
this goddess is about God and light
transformation and balance she's
represented by the Tree of Life symbol
which is connected with nurturing
aspects of life so that's why there's a
little trigger block necklace here and
it just kind of explains a bit more
about what this card can help with on
welcoming transformation finding balance
in yourself and naturally nourishing you
my body and spirit and then at the very
bottom of the card it has creating a new
dawn ritual which it kind of explains
how you can do a ritual to energize your
necklace
so just things to kind of put things
into place for you and it's just I don't
know I think it's a really nice touch
and I've never seen any other makeup
line do this I'm super happy with how
this makeup look turned out and I just
wanted to add in a bit of a description
with those products because I'm so
excited to be collaborating with them
and I hope you guys enjoy the link to
the website will be left down below if
you guys want to see how I pray that
this makeup look then please keep
watching I see a totally unknown entire
shouting screaming I thought I was dead
these eyes were telling me he's out of
his head Steve waked its own into trying
to tell me something that's a waste of
my time
I'm exhausted by the demons of my eyes
see
can't see that super parasite
who can't see
so this is the panel makeup look I hope
