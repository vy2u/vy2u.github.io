it's better than y'alls
hey everyone it's so today I just want I
would quickly film a little update video
because there's some big things that I
need to update you guys on so first
things first some of you if you follow
me on instagram it picked up on the fact
that I am going to France in a day's
time actually leaving to go on holidays
to France um tomorrow and I'm going to
be away for three whole weeks um it's
kind of crazy it's come around so
quickly here's a bit of an insight of
what I have planned because I'm never
really gone away for a really long time
when I've been doing YouTube when I've
been like seriously uploading videos and
stuff so I have been working in my
polygamous Maximus off to get some
videos up for you guys I so far have two
videos already scheduled and I'm working
like a Nancy to get another two
hopefully posted before I go to the
schedule okay my overall plan so far is
that I'm gonna have two videos up next
week two videos up the week after that
and hopefully a vlog in the last week
because hopefully when I'm over there I
will be able to vlog and then upload it
when I go into my hotel but I'm gonna
skim over the ugly there will be videos
uploaded it may not be as frequent like
what I've been doing like two or three
videos a week it'll be either two or one
video a week please just bear with me
I've been in exams I've been so so busy
trying to get everything sorted so I am
this is literally the best I can do I
have worked really hard to try and get
this all sorted for you guys but yet
just bear with me on that and replying
to comments might not be as fast and
everything but I will try my hardest to
find internet so I can still keep up
with what's going on and everything
pretty much what I'm doing is I'm going
to Fred for three weeks on school
exchange so I do Fred Eddie French in
school I'm horrible at it I literally
can say for sure come on Sabbath over
being messy and we
so tomorrow I leave and I fly to Dubai
for stopover and there we go we fly
onwards to Paris and we stay there for
one week so I'm really excited to do
that I've been to Paris when I was a lot
younger I can't really remember anything
when I was younger I remember the Eiffel
Tower and the after Triomphe but it'll
be good to go back and hopefully do some
shopping and see some of the sights
there and everything once we've done one
week in Paris we catch a train to
Toulouse and we meet up with our
homestay family so pretty much all of
the people going on the trip have little
families there they all go to this one
school so what are we doing for two
weeks I'll be going to school in France
and trying to like pick up the language
a bit more and just see what life's like
over there and I am so nervous because
mainly just because of the fact that I
am so bad at French and I get really
nervous when I'm speaking to people in
French I kind of know it but I just
freak out and then I can't get my work
that problem then I say something really
stupid like on a test one time the
teacher asked me the most simple
question like how are you and I said I
was 35 this is just the problems that I
have to deal with being really shouldn't
branch you guys have been asking me here
take my plenty I'm vlogging while I'm
over there and yes I'm planning on doing
it three vlogs I'm hoping I can do that
like it shouldn't be too much you're not
so I have to say about France and the
Paris and one I might meet some you guys
I'm walking around in Paris but again
converse in English preferably so that's
that I'm excited I'm nervous I haven't
even packed yet and I'm leaving tomorrow
and so I get back from France I think
it's like three days before Christmas so
in those three days I will be filming
and editing like a crazy person to try
and get like a Christmas video up for
you guys this is when it gets a little
bit more tricky for me because once I
get back and I've got those three days
like I'll try and probably get one video
up would be the most I could do because
then I leave straight after Christmas
and I go down to Paul's Festival and
that's like kind of like
I'm going to that Facebook for the whole
four days so I'm cabbing for five nights
it's pretty much like a whole week's
time but I will be vlogging there as
well so then eventually I'll get around
to editing a video from Falls and
uploading that like there's lots of
vlogs coming so going so many places in
the highest I am talking with my hands
after Falls
I'm going to be home for about 3 days
again and I'm gonna quickly try and
upload stuff then edit film and then I'm
going to Sydney for another few days my
friend and Maura and Taylor flying down
to Sydney like literally in a minute
after falls on the Monday to do it a
little fashion course down there and um
I wanted to come down with them but I
wouldn't really have anything to do
weather at the course so I'm flying down
with mum unlike the Wednesday it spent
some time with mum and we're looking at
some units and some houses in Sydney for
when I move next year or just kind of
like getting an idea for what we what we
want to try and like fine to buy or move
into and and then it's so excited
because my friend Ronnie brandy who I've
spoken about in some my videos before it
was another youtuber she's flying to
Sydney and staying with me save me and
Sydney and then on the weekend me Ronnie
Taylor and Maura all gonna go and go
Beach we're shopping do some fun stuff
in Sydney together and then Ronnie is
flying back with me to Brisbane and
staying in my place here and we're just
gonna have a fun old time of both like
so so excited we booked the flights and
everything already so it's all done it's
sorted as I said there's gonna be lots
of vlogs and then hopefully once I get
back here I'll film with Ronnie it's
just lots of lots of cool stuffs coming
up I'm overwhelmed by how excited I am
for all these things I have three
massive things happening these holidays
and I feel so lucky that I get to do all
of them like I'm so so excited
especially for the festival and then
Sydney and finance like oh my god some
important housekeeping situations now
that we stop talking about my holiday
because I'm just excited with my pure
boxes must you know I opened up here
bobs and when you send me letters I
always reply to them there is going to
be a major delay between my
when I'm away because obviously I'm not
going to be getting the letters so you
will all get a reply I promise it will
take me a little bit longer but it'll be
worth the wait I promise you often yes
and that's Christmas cards and
everything if you guys are sending me
letters in the time when I'm away feel
free to send me random stuff because and
like little Christmasy things and a lot
little things in there because when I
get back I'm planning on filming a big
like p.o box opening video which cuz you
guys all requested it so the more
interesting that things you can put in
there the better because it'll be really
awesome when I open it so that's one
thing my pics
really need your guy's help majorly I'm
calling out to you who all go with
technology and creative and better at
making YouTube banners than me as you
can all probably tell I've had the most
horrific YouTube banner it is like half
a little thing of like lipsticks because
my whole bad I get got caught up I had
like my name underneath it and like cute
stuff there but I can't seem to size it
probably it just won't fit in the box
I'm so bad at doing stuff like that and
I'm literally at the point where I'm so
desperate to get a nicer looking and fan
out that I'm just like okay I need to
call up with some help from you guys
I believe I'm awesome is from my like
Christmas present can you please if
you're good at making a banner I'm gonna
leave my email in the description book
what I'm asking is if you guys could try
and create some cool-looking Bennis may
I'm kind of looking for something just
really nice or go off my videos and just
like it has my name in it and it has
whatever else you think would look good
in a banner if you can make some bonus
for me and email me one and just you
know saying hey at the same time we have
a chat to going to select one of the
banners that you guys made and of course
I'll put like banner made by someone so
in my About section so you'll get full
credits for making the banner and
everything but I think it'd be nice to
have a banner made by one of you guys
because you would be better at it than
me so it feel like a win-win situation
like if you have a cat on it you have
like sparkles on it it could have like
just a simple my name anything I want
anything and everything and I'll see
what
looks good and what I like and I'm sure
I love all of them obviously but yet
though honestly honestly honestly me in
the world to me please and thank you
anyways I'm babbling and oh my gosh I
have so much other editing get done
right now so I'm gonna end this video
here hope that you guys will excuse the
fact that my wait for so long there will
still be videos don't worry I'll be
working my booty off even when I'm on
holidays to get them up easier for
watching this update we'll miss you guys
so much when I'm away is really sad I've
never been away from YouTube for this
long like I've literally become attached
to my channel and to you guys guys thank
you all so much for watching and we'll
see me in my next video that is uploaded
next week but I'll see you guys
properly when I get home from France and
I can't wait to speak to some of you
guys then alright I love you all so much
