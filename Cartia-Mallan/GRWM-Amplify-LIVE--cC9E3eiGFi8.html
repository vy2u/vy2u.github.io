doing a get ready with me for amplifier
video this is so so exciting if you guys
don't know I'm a part of the amplifier
Brisbane local talent so I will be an
amplifier in Brisbane just April the 9th
which is so super exciting because I get
to meet a whole bunch of you and I
cannot wait I'm like nervous but excited
about just all sorts of different
emotions going on the mall is sponsoring
amplifier so I have teamed up with them
today to do a get ready with me video
showing you guys the makeup look I'm
planning to wear to it amplifier this is
not the actual get ready with me it's
just kind of like a dress rehearsal get
ready with me because I feel like I'm
gonna be in so much of a rush and way
too nervous to be able to properly film
it so I'm gonna do it for you guys now
the whole message behind this video that
I'm doing with Rimmel is kind of just
about finding things that make you feel
confident so this makeup look I was
stepping you through all the things I do
that make me feel really confident what
I like to if my makeup guys want to see
the makeup look that I plan to do for
amplify it then please keep watching
hello again babies wow what a big jump
for phase of makeup - nothing I'm
starting with my lasting finished primer
by Rimmel to prime my face then I'm
taking my wake me up concealer and
putting this underneath my eyes now I
love to do this because it gets rid of
those dark circles I always have them
someone's time and sleepy but this is my
life Savior then I just like to put it
in with this brush and I forgot to
mention I just add a little bit on top
of my forehead - to give a slight kind
of highlighted look then with my lasting
finish foundation I'm going to be
buffing this into my skin I love this
for this foundation for this type of
event because it gives me a full
coverage and it makes me feel really
confident that all my blemishes are
hidden and it'll stay on it for a long
time then with the lasting finish powder
I want a modified kind of look so this
will help to do that and then keep the
foundation in place for my eyebrows I'm
taking the Rimmel brow pencil and
brushing through them then just filling
them in I like to do this just to make
sure the shape is all nicely in place
it makes me feel really confident when
my brows are looking on for leak for my
eye makeup today I'm taking the bottom
left shadow which is a really light kind
of frosty whitish color and I'm just
putting this all over my lid and then
with that top left hand brown color I'll
be defining my crease this is kind of
like my always go-to makeup look and
makes me feel really confident because
it's just nice and shimmery and light
with that top right hand color I'm
taking it on a fluffier brush a fluffy
like blending brush and defining it even
more and I love these colors because
they're really light and shimmery and a
little bit bohemian which is always my
go-to you guys are probably getting so
sick of this but I honestly wear it so
much because it's just my favorite I
think it just looks so so nice and
effortless then with my scandal eyes
liquid liner I'm going to be doing my
classic big winged eyeliner this helps
to open up my eyes even more
I think the winged eyeliner over time
has kind of just become my go-to
statement look I love how it always
turns out and it's just amazing and then
taking my natural bronzer I'm going to
be defining my cheekbones and kind of
just bronzing up my face overall because
I always like to give my face lots of
color and so I feel warm and what not us
I feel warm I don't know if that made
sense me get what I mean
so once you kind of happy with how
bronzer you are I'm take a brush and I'm
taking this really nice rose pink kind
of color and I just love how it adds a
bit of life and color and brightness
into my cheeks then with my apocalypse
lip lacquer I'll just be applying this
all over my lips
so this is all for the makeup look I
hope you guys enjoyed it excuse the
extreme dramatic everything change um I
accidentally deleted the action for this
video so I'm here to refill it again
kind of want to wrap up the video but
really kind of saying the message behind
this video is really just if you have
some sort of event or something
important to you just everyday life to
just wear things that make you feel
confident and that you love that express
yourself so as you saw in this video I
did my favorite makeup look you guys
will eventually see the outfit that I
wear to amplify I'm gonna keep it a
secret for now but I'm literally
bursting with excitement to show you
guys what the outfit is because I've
been waiting for a really long time to
get something from this store in
particular and this outfit is kind of
just expresses everything about me that
I love so hopefully I can do a little oh
oh TD on my outfit for amplify and you
guys will see it and I'm really excited
about it yay and I can't wait to see you

nervous and excited for it but it's
