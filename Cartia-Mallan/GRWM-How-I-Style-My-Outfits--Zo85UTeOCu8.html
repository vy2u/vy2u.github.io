doing well today I'm back and I'm
something a really exciting videos in
collaboration with sports girl and why
does video is so exciting is because I
haven't done a fashion video like this
in such a long time and I'm kind of
incorporating a lot of obviously sports
girls clothes also incorporating some of
my own styling tips and all sort of how
I style I think I think one of my
favorite things in fashion is definitely
playing with different styles and doing
things outside of the box playing with
like one key element and then mixing it
around and curling like daytime looks
nighttime house and just all sorts of
things that you probably wouldn't expect
that was worth together so that's what
I'm going to be doing for this video and
seeing as we're kind of coming into
winter I have chosen to do some styles
that are a more based around for cooler
weather and what girl has some really
key statement jacket in for this season
coming up and so they have sent me some
of the jackets and I picked my favorite
one which is the military jacket it is
super cool completely different style
I've never seen before and I love it so
what I'm kind of going to show you in
this video is some obviously I'm going
to show you some of my makeup that I've
just done but with some key folks from
being this jacket that I'll put in a
short hemisphere and I'm going to show
you how I style this up three different
ways so one jacket three ways is kind of
the focus of this these outfits is
completely inspired a lot from the
trends that I kind of saw when I was in
New York and in LA they're very sleek on
the go look for the cool things coming
up what I'm kind of trying to show you
guys is just when you buy like one
staple jacket or bomber or big trench
coat type of thing or cardigan that you
don't have to go out and buy like 20
different clothes for different
occasions you can really try and just
style things up differently and make the
same jacket work so yeah without me and
continuing to babble
jump into the makeup as you'll see in
the clip I've already done so much with
my honours my son died himself but I
want to showcase so my favorite books so
makeup products to you guys I've been
using full so my customers really items
which I like so much less makeup I ever
bought sounds really excited about this
they got really nostalgic about some of
these products so let's jump straight
into the makeup okay now that you guys
have seen this the makeup we're going to
get the exciting part I'm so excited to
show you guys these outfits all these
thousands going to be it based around
the military jacket and you'll see how I
style up these just ones and it has so
much fun playing around with this and
make sense of this is just showing you
guys different styling options and how I
like to style up things and just really
encourage you to like get creative with
your wardrobe and get creative with the
pieces that you already have
I can tell you what you wanna hear and I
can say Chris for
