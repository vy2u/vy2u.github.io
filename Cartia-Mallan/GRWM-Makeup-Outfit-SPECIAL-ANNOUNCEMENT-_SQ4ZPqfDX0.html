showing you guys how to achieve this
really simple look I actually wore this
look like two days ago on Friday night
my heart of friends like leaving parties
so a bunch of us all in turn to the
beach in the afternoon fancy drinks down
there and then we're going on afterward
so I had to be like casual yet kind of
dressy for going out afterwards it's so
so super simple it's not too heavy then
again it is still quite a bit of makeup
for the beach for what I would normally
wear but then again as I said I was
gonna I've just wanted to like kind of
figure out some sort of happy medium but
honestly it depends on your comfort
level with how much makeup you want to
wear or how little makeup you want to
wear I also am freaking obsessed with
this outfit at the moment so I like had
to incorporate it in somehow and show
you guys I'm wearing like all my friend
lines clothes I like went to our house
and rated her wardrobe the other
expanding so thanks Lauren
these are all your beautiful pieces that
I'm gonna show them off today and yeah
before we get into the video if you guys
aren't already subscribed to be go ahead
and press that subscribe button now on
I'm going to be having two videos up
every single week getting back into more
filming schedule now is so I'm much more
reliable I promise though eat Oreos a
week and if not then you can get mad at
me until then will be kind and stop if
you guys like this video give it a
thumbs up and leave a comment down below
any attributer requests and I'll try and
get around to that
just before I stop this video I have a
very very very very very very exciting
and
and I just want to in here quickly
I try and not get to theory about it
so recently make Wish Foundation
Australia got in touch with me and you
guys don't know what making which
foundation is pretty much it oh I'm
getting all choked up um pretty much it
is on stop yes pretty much
iconic thing is how many times gonna
take pretty much is an organization that
grants wishes for Sick Children who are
going through treatment for pretty
serious illnesses and it Adam now God
Okanagan roads are they help grant
wishes for these really some kids from
you know brighten up their day and might
give them that one thing that they
really want just before they go to
treatment and when they're kind of going
through a bit of a rocky time I guess
you could say I grew up always seemed
like news articles about all these
wishes that were being granted in my
ways thought wow if I was ever in that
point I wonder what I would wish for and
pretty much I got an email the other day
from a foundation and they told me about
this incredible young girl called Phoebe
hi Phoebe I know you're watching this
I'm going to keep going with the story
about this you need to say hi they gonna
tell me that she's from Sydney she is
currently undergoing treatment and
her one wish was to meet me and spend
the day with me
and oh my god I'm at when I would
whenever I was within the email I was I
was in a bathroom in Sydney Airport and
I first ended freaking tears so I got
icing but I'm excited to be able to
announce and let Phoebe know through
this video is that I accepted to make
this wish come true for you and if
anything it's more of a wish for me and
that it's so incredible for me that I
get to spend a day with someone's life
here I'm sure you both learn a lot from
each other and I'm so excited for you to
come and spend the day with me and Byron
and I heard that you really like ballet
so I'm sure we're gonna have some fun
dance around I choose to do ballet when
I was a little kid I sucked so maybe you
can teach me some tips on that I'm gonna
take some fun photos and we'll take a
little video together and let's have an
awesome day I'll show you around
all my favorite spots here in Byron and
nice comic to give you a big hug and
spend the day with you girls are getting
all teary I just feel extremely humbled
by you making that wish that you want to
leave me like that is just crazy and it
means the world to me and I
I'm so excited to meet you as already
said but yeah I'm such a little soka I
wish you the best of luck in your
treatment I'll be thinking about you the
whole time and stay strong it's one day
at a time and stay positive
make sure you take some time out to
yourself to relax and just do little
things that make you happy to take your
mind off what you're going through right
now and at no one else you say I am so
excited to meet you and yeah I'm like
already in my head planning some little
adventures that I want to take you on
and then I want us to do and I think
we're gonna have seriously the best day
ever and I'm excited and anyways that is
my announcement it is so exciting I'm
gonna be quiet now and we're just gonna
jump straight into this video hope you
guys enjoy before I start I just have to
say excuse the crazy bushy eyebrows they
are well and truly over due to be done
I'm starting out with the Batgirl prime
v benefit and just putting this all as
my face and I love this one because kind
of brightens as well as primes
then I'm just going to be taking at my
Rimmel wake me up concealer and a famous
under my eyes just to get rid of the
dark circles lately I haven't really
been wearing very much liquid foundation
but instead I've been this using powder
to kind of set this concealer in place
and I also to spread it out across my
face a little more as well just for a
very light kind of coverage
I'm just going to be brushing through my
brows and then filling them in as I
usually do and yes they need to be waxed
they are actually crazy right now with a
brow setting gel I'm just going to apply
this to hold all the hairs in place then
to lightly bronze my face I'm taking max
give me Sun and just applying this to my
cheekbones and top of my forehead and
also just underneath my jaw line then
I'm just taking this Too Faced blush and
applying this to my cheeks then with
Mac's soft and gentle highlighter I'm
applying this just above the blush there
and also on the tip of my nose and then
taking a Smashbox gel eye shadow I'm
just lightly tapping this all over my
lid and then putting it on the inner
corner to just for a nice little
shimmery look to give the icin
definition I'm taking a brown eyeliner
and just applying it on the waterline
and on the lower lash line as well as
lightly tapping it into the top lashline
and then I kind of just smudge it all
out to give a I don't know smokey kind
of look and then with my roller lash
mascara from benefit I'm just applying
this all over my top and bottom lashes
then I'm just applying a light pink lip
gloss for this outfit I am wearing
there's white dress from a spell and
the cake kind of thing on the top is
literally just like a kimono that I've
tied up and I'm not actually sure where
the kimonos from as I said these are all
Lauren's clothes but I just kind of wore
this without the shoes really but when I
went out later I was choked on some
boots yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
