very pale right now I am very bad I've
just come back from yoga I've been
really sick for the past few days I got
an eye infection I've just been so I'm
down you guys would have seen my fashion
week vlog I kind of spoke a bit there
about feeling really stressed and a bit
overwhelmed by the whole experience and
I said I just had a lot going on in my
life at the moment and I haven't really
been communicating much with you guys I
haven't been posting very much I think I
just needed and I never I don't know I
just take a minute to kind of sort
through some things and get back to
myself and be like what are you using
this platform for like what why did you
why do you love this why do you what do
you love talking about and I'm really
happy that I'm kind of coming back to
myself and finding my voice again I'm
reading again I'm trying to write more
I'm trying to be more accountable of
myself as a human to continue to grow
and learn new things so I can inspire
and help you guys learn and grow and the
only way I can do that is by documenting
my own journey so I thought I'm just
gonna pick up the camera you know press
record and we're gonna just filmed
himself so I finally went back to your
like my first yoga class again in ages
it was very challenging I'm still really
sick and I was doing like a hated level
2 vinyasa every time we go to like
downward dog up like oh my god my nose I
was coughing but I went I did it and I
walked there and then I walked home and
I got a coffee on the way home and I
have just said to myself and this is I
think the most important thing for me
getting back to my positivity getting
back to just being on a good vibe and
being able to attract things and learn
new things like for my consciousness to
be open to only things and to hear what
my outer self is trying to tell me is
that you've got to be in a good mindset
you have to remind yourself we're
grateful for and to kind of say a day
off with
a bit of a positive disposition like
when I woke up this morning I said to
myself today is gonna be a great day
you're so lucky I'm grateful I I am love
I love me and I love my life and I love
everything around me and something magic
is gonna happen today and so I've just
been reminding myself when I was in yoga
and I was getting challenging I was
reminding myself of exactly that too so
I feel really good because I'm excited
like I feel like I'm coming back to
myself which is amazing because I just
feel like I haven't been able to I don't
know I felt really restricted for a
little while I couldn't really express
myself the way I wanted to because I was
just scared of judgment I guess which is
so stupid because I've come this far
pretty much just speaking my mind the
whole time you guys know I write my
ridiculous long captions I just read
about things so like we're back we're
doing that anyways I'm talking to you
along what I have done this morning and
I have just cooking my coffee got my
infant up here burning right near the
beautiful flowers that Lola got me this
is after my my mind looks like I make a
protein smoothie I use protein powder
ice what up frozen blueberries and you
just blend that so simple taste so yummy
and on top I just put like some
strawberries chia seeds pumpkin seeds
whatever I really got in the pantry I'll
put on I've also just made a lemon and
ginger tea oh it's just kind of sit down
at my little table in the middle of my
apartment I love just like doing like we
have everything a full list of stuff I
need to get done today they always have
to write a list at the side of the day
just so that mentally I know exactly
what I'm gonna achieve and what I'm
gonna get done and now I'm just eating
this going through some emails as I do
this I'm gonna meditate have a shower
and then get into my wife yes at the
moment I have been obsessed with
listening to the artists ah y-x
literally
I've been getting work done all day I'm
getting ready to go for dinner I've got
a bit a time to kill and I have been
getting so many questions and I always
have gotten a lot of questions about my
hair and hair extensions above you guys
know a little while ago I got my
permanent hair extensions removed but I
got them out just because was really
ruining my natural hair I was just like
I want my natural hair to grow because
my not joy I was actually really thick
and nice and I love it and I used to
before I had ponents I had clippings so
I was like done I got my cheek lipids
because they're like equally as amazing
and it's so easy to put in go right
before I went to Coachella I was like no
I'm not getting the opponent on so I
can't cuz I just know myself and I went
get them back out so I reached out to
Saleh hair extensions and asked them to
send me something so I could test them
and they're like yeah yeah of course try
them out everyone loves them they're the
best and I was like okay let me try them
and they actually are so I'm gonna show
you guys like while you get ready this
is sponsored but it's said to them like
I'm not gonna look into a sponsorship
with you until I've tried them and I as
you would have seen I wore them at
Coachella and I've been wearing them for
photoshoots cuz obviously some of my
clients still really want me to have
that long hair that I know my have so
literally like I had a shoot with
Sephora the other day and we use them
and I still like plotted out from the
shoot but I'm gonna show you guys and
step you through and tell you a bit
about so weird a bit about the hair
extensions that I use but we can just
talk about this once and for all because
I get that many questions but by the way
my hair look how much it's actually
growing honestly just the most exciting
thing to see my natural hair growing but
obviously it's not really at the light
that I want yet like I of having hair
like this long so it's still amazing to
have the option to put in clip-ins and
this is not a plot by the way it's just
the hair is all putted up so it doesn't
get another bite
transfer it I've tried a lot of clip in
hair extensions I had actually reached
out to a company before I reached out to
Zola and they sent me some
and I was like no way these are trash
and I sent them back and then I'd
reached out to the other ones like let
me try these ones so guaranteed things
are amazing I like these because they're
super thick it depends on what type of
extensions you're looking for you can
obviously order different like
thicknesses and grams and I don't know
like the technical talk behind it we
really do like brand reviews on my
channel I honestly want to make this
somewhat informative so I asked them to
send me some info it's 100% human remy
hair wonderful multi tone color blend so
I make sure it naturally blends in with
the air which is perfect because I have
all different kind of shades going
through my hair and so do these they're
like the most perfect match of all to
design to protect your natural hair with
those little strips and it like grips
your hair nicely and they're not too
heavy they don't pull down too much but
the ones that I have a 24 inch and they
literally the thickest ones in all of
the whole market my old head dress would
be laughing at me right now because
every time I went to going at my head
and he was like so what length and
thickness I was like come on the
thickest and the woman because is always
what I want these are a little bit wavy
right now my hair is pretty straight
right now I'll show you guys how I clip
them in and then I will like style my
hair up to make them all blend in
normally I would like fully cow my hat
and feel like oh they clip in separately
if I wanted to Kelly but I don't want it
curly and I don't want to completely
straight I want it to look quite natural
so I've actually never done that so I'm
actually just gonna try and clip them in
as my hair is this might completely fail
but we'll give it a try I just wanna at
least show you how I do it and how easy
it is I never actually used every single
clip because there's so much head yes
they just got little clips again
Tina you probably know what they look
like I'm going to lay them down get
started
ruch my hand get my cookie and I stopped
by just potty in like that hair is
actually feeling quite soft so what I
might do if that's the case I'll just
grab some hair spray and like spray it
along really I'm really not professional
but like this is how we do it and then I
just tease it up a little bit so it can
grip which lady's house so strong in the
hair so now I pretty much literally just
repeat this over and over again just
speed you guys up while I keep flipping
these and you'll see pretty much what I
do
oh it's really starting to come together
look how long they are I love them so
much even though I've definitely been
loving life with short hair like I
always miss having long @i cameras
flashing and it's dying off so once I've
kind of done like the main body of the
hair sometimes for my hair after
separately like obviously I think that
it's one bit straight love it's not but
sometimes to style it probably it
depends if it's cold or straight or
whatever but I normally will just pop
this front bit here like this and clip
one directly there and just tap it
towards the front cut my hands a bit
thinner at the back so I don't want them
to show gonna go on clip the two one
front ones in there like as I just
showed you but it charges camera and I'm
gonna come back and show you how I'm
styling my head and I said this is like
my favorite hair styler do I just get a
scrunchie here on all hair time when I
do is they pull these front bits here to
the back like literally the most simple
thing in the world but I love it and
then I just pull it up and she's cute
because it kinda adds to the look a bit
more I feel like to pull some little
bits down at the front this is the look
that hands on the best quality clippings
I've ever used so I'm gonna leave all
the links down below if you guys to
check them out and yeah you guys are
proud it's been like a few months I
still haven't gotten my permanent
extensions back in and I'm not going to

enough I'm gonna run out the door now
