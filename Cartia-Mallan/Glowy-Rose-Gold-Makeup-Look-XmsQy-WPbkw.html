hello everyone alright I'm starting on
the eyes today and I'm taking this
really light brown shade and using it to
define my crease and it's going to just
set us up for the rest of the colors
that we put on the lid then i'm taking
this mac pigment in the color 10 and i'm
going to be getting just a small little
brush and also spraying my mac fix+
spray on this to UM make it easier to
put the pigment on and so it stays on
and just kind of grips a little bit
better then with a fluffy blending brush
I'm just taking a very similar color
that's just a little bit deeper to put
kind of on the outer corners and into
the crease as well this is just going to
give it a little bit more depth and I
kind of love how this looks together and
then with even fluffier brush I'm
blending this out and then with this
light highlight Naked Lunch color from
Mac I'm putting this on my inner corner
to add even more glow and I just love
how this all looks together once I've
added this inner corner highlight I'm
taking Cocoa Puffs from one of my Too
Faced palettes and I'm just blending
this into the crease to define it even
more then I'm taking my Holy Grail
eyeliner this is be their real benefit
gel liner and I freaking love this stuff
is the only eyeliner I ever use and I'm
just putting on some wings as I usually
do and then I'm just taking a brown
eyeliner pencil and defining my lash
line and also my inner waterline then
with a pencil eye shadow brush and this
dark brown color I was taking this and
apply misunderstandings a look and makes
it a little bit darker then I'm just
popping on some mascara you can tell
I've already done my base but I'm just
going to be bronzing up my face a little
bit with Bahama Mama by the balm and
then I'm going to be taking a smaller
tapered brush and mice I think this is
my sleek contour kit and just defining
my cheekbones even more after this I'm
taking hot mama by the balm and I'm
putting this on my cheeks to give that
rose gold kind of glowy color on
there as well then to highlight I'm
taking Mecca cosmetics new highlight
which is coming under the new Christmas
range and I freaking love this stuff it
is amazing amazing and I'm just putting
this all over my cheeks and my nose and
my top lip area and then I'm just taking
two nude lip gloss shades and blending
these together so that is office glowy
kind of rose gold makeup looking super
short and simple I hope you guys enjoyed
