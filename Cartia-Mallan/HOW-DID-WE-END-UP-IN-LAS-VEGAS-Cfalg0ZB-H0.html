life is like let's pack up bags and get
the fuck out ow two girls and cherry
print on the loose
oh we go saying to each other I really I
really feel like we're going to Vegas
like we like buy things on whatever lady
okay and we always listen to what we
like feel and see I always have these
vivid visions of stuff that's gonna like
go on in my life when all we've been
saying we going to Vegas I was like I
feel like I see us in Vegas but I woke
up and I spoke on the phone to grace and
she was like you'll never believe what
cuz like I got home at like 5:00 a.m.
this morning I'm still a bit drunk but
like she was like you'll never believe
what I'm doing and I was like if you say
going to Vegas it's like yeah we just
booked tickets to go to Vegas and then I
was like I can get tickets for this life
is beautiful festival I wanted to go to
that I don't know why we put it off
we both knew that we needed to go like
wanted to go but we put it off for some
reason and now we're packing our bags
because I'm honestly like at this point
where I'm like I when I was younger I
swear to god I used to get up trust my
instincts and just go and have fun and
like do something I wanted to do it and
I love festivals I loves like this I'm
talking like that the world's about to
end but like I miss being like this
spontaneous and reckless and youthful
with my life and this is the only thing
that I thought gives me the best
inspiration and I'm like why would we
not just get up and do it and like the
only reason why we wouldn't go as if
we're fearful of something not working
out which the whole fucking journey of
making stuff work is the best part so
come with us who knows what the hell
we're doing or what might happen
we just gonna pop out back face like see
how can I've done that all the road trip
together like and we just winged the
whole thing so we're just gonna go wing
this and make a funny fucking video out
of it and make some memories and like
what we're gonna go wake up Lily and see
if she wants to come otherwise we'd be
bouncing Oster all I can explain is I'll
explain on our car ride to Vegas but
like pack the baggage with some festival
stuff but it's going through the night
Lily Lily dude where are you
everything's really crazy just packing
shit we'll be there and like at yours in
like 30 minutes and then we'll leave in
like an hour
cuz once we get to yours I just have to
get my stuff together this is literally
gonna be the craziest thing I've I love
you she was like she said fuck it I was
like that is exactly this right now oh
my god just pack all my makeup and then
I'll be ready I'm feeling good feeling
I'm crazy
they picked up oh that's going on how
you feeling no I can just been woken up

shrieking hey fuck your bags we're going
yeah
so far no tickets long as we got of
long as we got ya just pulling here for
the Gaza Strip here we go Oh fuckin
naughty
I don't know where we are right now this
is the situation
and also like not have a plan
little turtles riding the waves I feel
like it's so scary like doing things
like this but when you don't like
unknowns I'd like really freaking out
about something like that so I think
lessons learned as much the time we
broke open to like the situation like
this you make memories
we use inspiration
just wondering lots of choices and
everything what the fuck are we doing
and we've just got into the hotel we've
checked into the Golden Nugget drink
