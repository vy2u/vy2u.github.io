here today
honestly I'm someone sure about this
outfit I'm so much sure about the
lighting I have no idea if I'm even in
focus or what's going on but I'm just
going to start filming god I had to
close all the windows and it's already
freaking hot I might just open it so we
good alright hello everybody welcome to
my channel I don't know what I'm saying
I spent every single time I sit down to
film a video something else that comes
out I'm like what are you doing like you
don't normally do that don't know just
shut up cardio today I've got a really
exciting video that I've wanted to film
for ages but as you guys know how to
move to Sydney quite abruptly so before
I left bone I got a huge parcel of new
makeup and beauty products from Mecca
they sent me all of them like the
Christmas range and I was like oh my god
bless your soul because I have not
bought new makeup in a year and I hadn't
bought new makeup until I went to New
York actually and then when I came home
they sent me all of these goodies that
I'm going to show you guys my couch has
been delivered today and I'm just
praying that they don't bother the
doorbell while I'm filming so this will
just be really awkward all glammed up
just sitting at home I don't even know
where to start let's just just jump in
with the brightest folks that there is
so all the packaging is obviously
different because I've taken it a lot of
the box and stuff and I've used some of
the products so um this is just a big
Smashbox container and inside it had it
didn't have all that stuff it just had
three of these little products in it and
I was so freaking cute I love just
packaging as I thought it was really
adorable so there is a contour palette a
lip palette and also an eyes palette
actually use this on my house today
the colors are really really nice the
contour I haven't used yet there are
like little mini ones and then the lips
I love the lips one I actually haven't
used like a lip palette since I was
little and you know when you get like
the like kids makeup and they always
have lip palettes
um yeah I hadn't used one ages but then
I tried this one yesterday and I love
umm this color down here mixed with this
color up here so there are other things
from Smashbox and as metal comes in this
box
I love having storage boxes like this as
long as it's really handy to store
makeup obviously so I got some really
cute washes from Too Faced these all
came in a set with a like lip injection
lip plump lip gloss I took one out of me
the other night and I've misplaced it
these came in like little christmas sets
and it was like the blush and then you
get like a lip injection lip balm
thickened nude kind of blush color that
also came with like a nude lip plump and
then there is a pink one that also came
with a more pink toned um lip combo so
yeah i love mixing these two colors here
that this one is called crazy in love
and this one is called baby love so they
might also sell them individually I'm
not sure but yeah I love mixing these to
do that that's what I've got on my
cheeks I might want to show you like
some other products from Too Faced long
talk about three bags oh then I got the
Christmas in New York palette it just
looks like this I'm so excited to try
this out these colors are perfect
exactly what I love I love like um like
kind of shimmer times and then I also
love good browns for transitions and I
also love like a bit of black ink acts I
want to darken up a look a lot and I
really keep packaging and it made me
like really miss yeah as a New York you
guys know I Love New York came with like
a little mini better than sex mascara
and I love this mascara I used to use
this heaps is the best mascara ever I
don't use as much mascara anymore
because I do get lash extensions put on
to answer the question you guys always
ask me if I got lash extensions and yes
I do they also sent me heaps of the Too
Faced melted lipsticks and I freaking
love these it's like they read my mind
then
me they like that they know what's up
because I love these I'm missing one
color from this that's in my handbag
somewhere I'm not sure one that I'm
wearing on my lips today with this
over-the-top weird combo I don't know
why I use like a purple lip gloss over
the top but you can use any lip gloss
but it's this Too Faced melted in
chocolate honey and guys I'm not kidding
you smells so freakin good SS stuff is
delicious and I love the color
I'm not only into brown but it's not too
dark it's not too light it's just
perfect
they also sent the color melted berry
which will be really really cute lted
fig I'm not that into wearing like
really bright Pink's or Purple's but
could be cool you never know and this
one looks stunning this is the melted
matte
um and this red just looks so beautiful
no note of red lipsticks they they also
send a few nice products and the first
one is just lipstick it's like nas Sarah
moon if I don't know if ceremony is a
person I don't know if I'm out of the
loop or maybe it's just the name of
their campaign nonetheless this red is
like a really deep um really deep red
and I love deep reds if you really want
to go for like a sexy like deep red with
like a winged eyeliner like little nail
polish and this is just like a nas Sarah
mood now apologies other - Sarah moon
products so I'll show you this one first
the packaging is insane like it's huge
it's really beautiful and sleek though I
like I love it I'm okay so inside there
is the audacious mascara and it looks
fuller and there's two lipsticks in here
the first one is in the color bet and
it's really really beautiful super deep
red it's almost like brownie red looking
hot and the other one is in the color
Liesel more of a warm toned red as the
next thing is this palette and AMA title
about this okay so this is the true
story
um cheat and lip palette how do you mean
lip palette I'm so like blushes to me
this one at the end I'm guessing is a
highlighter but oh my gosh this one
looks incredible is moving on I got this
amazing product from hourglass I saw
this at the at the mecca like Christmas
viewing and semi an hour both like oh my
gosh we need this the packaging is just
like a marble top kind of thing and they
also sent this hourglass brush and I
just use this for highlighter and that
one's blush and this is what the palette
looks like it's kind of like all these
beautiful marbled highlighters and
blushes and this brush is also
incredible and it's good to have like a
two on one blush and highlight because I
always lose my brushes and my makeup bag
extra things I was so excited about they
sent me two beautiful candles this first
one I've been burning a little bit as
you can see and this is honestly the
most ahh I die it's such a Christmas
candle and light and try to pretend like
I'm in like snowing outside really
 boiling and I'm sweating but we
like the Christmas candle when I sip my
coffee and I just play pretend but this
is um where is this from
Oh Dipti what does that smell like how
do I even explain a smell it's quite
sweet with a hint of like red wine with
a hint of like cherries but not cherries
like it's just yummy like vanilla II
it's young I don't even know I second
candles from why don't we scandal brands
like confusing name by Rideau by windows
by Rho dou by Road oh yeah whoo this
candle I haven't burnt yet um it just
looks like this
and it smells almost like men's corn
it's a very deep smell a lot more
masculine but also quite sweet-smelling
I'm not trying to explain it and I love
candles like this it's just like a very
like grounding scent I'm not sure if
that makes sense
good I love it's like stronger and I
love men's cologne so that's you just
lied and you have this sexy time with
your speaker that's that's not what I
mean okay like I mean like you can light
it you can make it and we'll leave that
one next they sent me a little set of
cause products and these are so
beautiful two body milks and this one is
basil lemon and this one is called
Santorini vine they both smell beautiful
and are really really great moisturizers
they just send a shampoo conditioner and
also a basil lemon body wash so I'm
excited to try these out also scent um
some really cute masks I always try and
put on a face mask every week so they
sent me a natural clay mask avocado mask
which if you know me when I got this I
was like oh my god ma boo I love avocado
to eat and why not put up my body as
well
watermelon mask which is interesting
I've never tried this then the last few
products is some stuff from this work
and I've seen this before and I love
stuff like this so this is a deep sleep
Stressless
um almost like aromatherapy oils kind of
thing oh yeah I love using oils like
this for like natural sleep aid because
they only have like lavender and other
good oils in it they can kinda just
relax your body and calm you down and
they also send a deep sleep pillow spray
so I'm assuming you just spray this on
your pillow before you want to go to
sleep but it's not like YUM these are
really helpful to have and I love that
they're a mini size so if I'm traveling
always good to get some sleep aid the
love dropped it all over the floor okay
now the last products that I got is from
the brand called Ren clean skincare and
they just sent a little set that has
a cleansing gel a moisturizing cream I
really loved it and then they also just
sent a revitalizing night cream that is
everything for this whole video so happy
we got through that video without my
buzzer ringing if it goes off right now
that would be the biggest joke of 2016
this whole year has been like quite a
joke the encouragement for anyone that
is still struggling with 2016 and it's
just absolute fuckery let's be real just
keep pushing through because I feel like
2017 is going to be a much better year
um praying for that thank you guys so
much for watching this video I'm going
to be doing a lot more with beauty again

those out you guys made my day don't
forget to go and give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed and you want to
see more haul videos or if you're

um it's easier for me to do it now
because when I was living in byron like
I'm living in a big I lived in a beach
town for literally a year and I just
didn't wear makeup much because it was
just not necessary to smack on a face
and makeup when I'd be going to the
beach now that I'm in a city and I'm
