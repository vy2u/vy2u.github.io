shirts at the moment because you can
like wear a cute bra under it and it can
be a bit like seen through it this one's
cool because it has like the polka dots
on the front and then they're really
cool detailing on this side shoulder and
fine
I have a new denim skirt I've been

Tibbals in other ways and is also just a
really perfect length this will be so

bit of bright pink every once in a while
you can sell the tops so epically then I
just have some really cute white shorts
I love these because they're super loose
on my legs and I just love the cut of
them I don't know any white shorts so
yeah that it's a good stable piece to
have and they're just so comfy and then
for another like basic piece I just have
this really simple structure from the
fifth label having just a basic
structure is perfect for when you just
in a rush to go out you buy a copy just
flip it on with those white shores or
the denim skirt some sneakers and you're
good to go

very ribbed style down the middle part
it's super slimming next to some
accessories I have this epic contour
like detailing black backpack this is
going to be perfect for Bojan LOL
because it just suits everything in
sometimes I like using a slide bag some
days I like using a backpack really
great qualities the like the seat
leather is very thick and very durable a
great feature about this is that there's
the drawstring on the top so if you are
in a sexual or wherever you can this and
you've got a really full bag being able
to do it up and keep everything enclosed
is like key so nothing goes flying out
also someone love with this is QT little
like it can be used as a side bag and
also be pulled into a backpack and love

wisteria and also a little tiny bit of
Snapdragon as well then from Becca

black shade of coz if you're into winged
eyeliner please trust me on this one
this is the best product in the game I
will never go back to using liquid liner
ever stop stopping then I will be really
upset on and I start to mention the last
product I got is another Jeffrey stop
when I Sammy has got me onto this
because she like raves about it is the
Jeffrey sell liquid lipstick in the
shade of celebrity skin she always wears
this and normally this kind of attire
doesn't suit me very well but I have it
on right now with a little bit of a
lighter gloss over the top and it's just
perfect I love it and it stays on so I
put this on honestly like two hours ago
okay the next two things I have to this
whole or from Sporto and jump in show
you guys what I got myself this one I
think this is so funny cool it's the
material like a big windbreaker jacket
and I just love it
cleaning traps which looks so cool it's
so comfortable just to throw on and this
is so fun for a festival I can start a
matte color at nighttime just to throw
in a light layer while still looking at
loveable menu festival attire so
obsessed with it it picked up is really
adorable like velvet cell bag with
really pretty tassels so nice rock
festival it has beautiful little
drawstring detailing on the top so one
thing you guys know I like the
drawstrings and nothing goes flying out
you can just tie it out like that and
it's like a little pouch festival bag
don't wait to wear this one I picked up
something really different for me and
I'd only wear like sneakers besides I
have this white part to me because I
wear everywhere but I picked up
something a little different once there
like a kind of more time called sneaker
with like a white detail on the bottom
why I love these is that you don't
actually have to tie and untie them this
pulls it on the sides I mention life are
really easy but this wouldn't be cute to
put on with a like little denim skirt
and just kind of I love this having
shoes you can throw on then I define
another jacket and like super into

most beautiful detailing on the back it
has this kind of looking carpet print
with this fringe hanging out the top
here and the bottom has the most
beautiful gold detailing with little
silver coins and I just think this is
such a nice jacket the make of it is so
great if a nice like stick and soft
movable like denim you know have some
denim is very stiff this one is just
really soft and wealthy does that make
sense
