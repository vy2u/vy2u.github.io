filming a massive haul for you guys I
have so many new products I'm done and
share with you so yeah let's just jump
straight into the mini mall hangout I
actually like I'm not even joking this
is the box and stuff and I have filled
with things to show you guys let's just
start with some clothing right now in
Cartland France but this video was
filmed prior to when I left so this is
like video Inception kind of thing like
I'm actually in France but you're
watching me sitting in my room filming
but before I left I ordered a some
winter clothing that's obviously winter
and France right now so for all of my
viewers in the I don't even know what
hemisphere that would be if it's winter
where you are right now here are some
products that you may be interested in
so starting us off I ordered items of
sheinside I'm gonna start with my
favorite which is this really nice like
navy blue jacket with a cream-colored
lining there is a hood on it and
everything
I kind of got a size too big by accident
but it's good because what I can do is I
can if I'm like if it's really cold I
can layer like a longer top underneath I
can put this on over the top and really
lightweight but it's surprisingly quite
warm I have a box art in this vacantly
from a shown photo ordered this cute
little puffy kind of jacket it's fine
I'll put on so sorry it's not exactly a
try on haul but other stuff so that you
can get the idea of it more if actually
put it on so it's so puffy it's so warm
that so this looks like this
this jackets stupid kid but I was a
little bit disappointed because in the
photo it looked as if it was gonna be a
little bit longer and this one's kind of
like a midriff t-1 like it doesn't come
down all the way like as far as I wanted
it to so I was a little bit disappointed
with that but nonetheless it's still
super cute and would be really
and some jeans and as I'm like a plain
top and maybe some jewelry next up for
clothing I have some really cute pieces
from the lookbook straw I'll grab them
out of my box three clothing items from
the lookbook store and then two bags so
I'm just gonna start with the clothing
first and I'm going to start off with
this another little sweater and this one
I'm in love with it is so adorable
it's this little really thinly knitted
sweater and it has two little shells on
the front it's just a really nice kind
of soft feel and on the Shelf I don't
know if you can see they're like little
sequins so it's really simple but really
cute and the second thing I got was this
really awesome lace long-sleeve Kate
goes like that
and it goes all the way down to my feet
it's super long and the material is so
nice feeling it's really stretchy and
really really soft so I love it the
final thing that I got was this little
kind of reminds me of like a sports luxe
kind of style it's this little cropped
to me trying to like reach her it's his
little cropped um
long-sleeve a top with these little two
white lines of detail it's not like a
ridiculously clear material it's quite
thick so it really is quite warm I put
it on the other night and I was like
DISA I think it would look really
awesome with black on blacks like some
high-waisted black pants and some boots
now for my ultimate favorite part of
that order alder - super cute bags from
the lookbook store as well and here is
my absolute favorite one it is this
seriously adorable I'm like suede brown
leather shoulder bag and it has an
adjustable strap on the side so you can
literally alter it if you want it longer
or shorter and it is so cute ously just
look at that one sanic from France I'm
going to a festival so this is going to
be perfect committed to the festival um
the quality of it is so good and it was
so cheap is perfect I love it
the second bag that I got was exactly
what I was looking for it's this little
black leather backpack now I don't ever
ever ever wear backpacks like this um I
voicing them on people
I hope they look cute but I'd never
thought I'd wear them but I ordered it
because for when we do like traveling
and day trips around Paris that I can
just put like my camera on my wallet and
my phone in there like it's not
ridiculously huge spacing but it'll fit
like just enough stuff that I need and
it's just easier there carrying like a
handbag around ever I can just plop this
right on my back just think it's really
it's like fashionable but key to feel
like Dora the Explorer I've got to go on
my little excursion so let's move on to
some cosmetics oh my god I've been
literally peeing myself with excitement
in anticipation to show you guys this
stuff that I have gotten it's actually
sitting right behind me here I was in
this city yesterday but if you're
watching this I would have been last
week um and I went in to get where they
sell like toothpaste and Smashbox and
all of them that stuff and I was walking
past I was like Matt I was admiring all
that let's just go have a look at like
the Christmas specials I'm a kid so I
walked past and I could see there's all
this new to face stuff to face is like
one of my like favorite high-end brands
all I could see was this the toothpaste
section with all this sparkly stuff so I
know how to further look at what they
had and they had these amazing palettes
and all these really good gift sets that
was so so cheap or cheap for Australia
very much I picked up this little set it
is the toothpaste under the mistletoe
night edition lipstick trio and glitter
bag so it comes in this little bubble
lipsticks come in this super adorable
little lipstick purse it's bright
freaking pink and it has a little bell
on the end then they come up with these
three lipsticks and how adorable is the
packaging there is the color shimmery
spice baby which is like a kind of red
color really really beautiful on it I
think it's like the perfect Christmas
day lip color you're not really into
bright red then next one
there is the
a shimmery marshmallow bunny and this is
a super cute um like baby pink color
lobster ball my favorite this was one
that I saw and I was like oh my god I
have to get this set it is the colors
shimmery and naked Dulli and this is
like the most ultimate amazing shimmery
nude color I have it on right now I
don't even know what it is it's just the
most perfect nude and the thing is that
I love about it is because I love kind
of frosty colors these are frosty but
they're not overly frosty like they're
not like ridiculous he's had the most
incredible undertones of these little
golden flakes all three of the lipsticks
had them in it for the three lipsticks
I'm pretty sure if I remember correctly
it was 30 37 or 36 dollars all up which
is incredible if you shop high-end quite
a bit because one MAC lipstick in
Australia is $36 so to get three really
amazing colors for that March and an
adorable little pink sparkly bag was
pretty good if you ask me so I had to
get it secondly when I was in the city I
picked up some new open I know plushies
and I am obsessed with these colors I
absolutely amazing it's so classy and a
neutral color but it still looks like
you know it's notice whether you have an
alcohol on and this is in the color
salmon sand and obsessed completely and
utterly I love it so much
so that's that one salmon scent and then
the second color that I got because I
was alone you guys know I love glitter
I met a lot of nail polishes that are
like glittery look kind of tacky Oh
gross but I found this incredible
glitter nail polish from OPI and it is
in the color Muppets world tour that is
an interesting name okay but pretty much
what I like to do is I like to put a
base color so say I had like white or I
put down the salmon sand color I think
it's perfect for Christmas time because
it's just adds a little bit of you know
glamour to nails it's all sparkly and
pretty so again those two I love at the
moment that
probably my favorite OPI nail polishes -
like the holiday season for next
season's next another bigot box of
makeup I'm going to skim through these
ones really quickly but I was lucky
enough to have room will send me out
some products a launch of the Rimmel
London that pravakar lips 16 hour kiss
proof lip colors let me tell you warning
and word of advice don't go swatching
all the colors on your arm because you
will find that they are most definitely
more than kiss proof they'll also makeup
remover proof when you're trying to rub
them off your arms so don't do that yeah
all the provoker lips lip licker lip
glosses sticks whatever you want to call
them there is a dark purple a dark um
noob of kind of an orangey red undertone
a bright red a nude a bright pink or
baby pink a middle toned pink I don't
know how to explain them and I'm more
deep um red they're really good I love
the colors that really pigmented and
awesome that they stand for that long
they don't budge so especially it's
great when you have red lips on because
that's the one pain-in-the-ass thing
when you have to reapply and reapply and
reapply points at least like with these
you don't they stay on once they're on
they stay on and next I got sent four
little quads this one is in the shade
Victoria's Purple's pink pink a dilly
circus that's a really random name so
yeah I'm that's more pinky times then I
got gold and I we call chain in the
middle with some other darker like navy
blues and black color and then finally I
got brixon Brown which is probably my
favorite there's a really nice like
shimmer shade there and some dark Browns
and like a nice Moroney color in the
middle they would be really nice if
you're in winter next up I was sent to
my stars then I got send um to BB Creams
and to prime the next up they send me
three over the
hate most lipsticks and I have this
pinky Shea in the number 103 and then I
have a bright pinky ready it's like a
bright pink reddish toned lipstick in
the colour 106 I think I already have
this one actually and finally a dark
kind of red color in 107 which I really
like my favorite thing about these
lipsticks that I actually already have
quite a few in my makeup collection
smell absolutely incredible like
cherries and sweet stuff they smoke
really really nice they send me one of
the little polka lips lip lacquers I
have three of these already obsessed
greatest lip glosses lip lacquers
whatever you want to call it ever so
pigmented such a beautiful red color
then they send me some of the scandal
eyes eye shadow sticks I haven't used
any of these yet but there's a purple
shade a black shade and the gold shade
which I probably wear the most and they
look pretty nice so I'm excited to test
these out and there's also just some
eyeliner so a black eyeliner and a cream
colored eyeliner for my waterline and
these look pretty decent that's not all
that Rimmel sent out to me they also
sent me this incredible acrylic makeup
um holder which is pretty great to get
send because these are expensive and
it's hard to find good quality ones
they're big enough that fit everything
and fit honestly this is fun as I
haven't put anything in it yet so I
could show you guys pretty much there is
a lift up top which is awesome because I
can put some pallets in there and like
and then there's lots of little drawers
underneath them and these drawers slide
really nicely the quality's amazing
actually the room or brand this is from
the brand they left their name in the
top here it is from the makeup box shop
I'm so excited to
pack all my makeup into it it'll look so
pretty once it's all in there oh and
I'll also mention I think if you saw my
vlog from my Christmas shopping I just
think I'll also hold these absolutely
incredible earrings these are from
princess Polly I am obsessed with when I
saw them online I was like oh yes yes
yes girlfriend and then they came in the
mail the next day which is pretty good
and they was touching it I think they're
only like 17 or 19 dollars something and
there's so much bigger than I expected
them to be I don't know if they're sold
out I'm expecting they might be sold out
but princess Polly had some pretty
awesome stuff so go check them out I
think that's all I have to say so I hope
you'll enjoy this whole I literally
haven't done one in soil and so it's
good to get back into doing them parent
holidays right now like I am I hope
you're all having an absolutely
incredible holiday I can't wait to see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
