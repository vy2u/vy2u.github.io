to be doing my first ever Halloween
makeup tutorial or like Halloween video
it's nothing scary at all so if you're
expecting scary I wouldn't be watching
this video cuz it's really not as you
can tell I just wanted to do and how
will we look that's kind of hot it's on
the sexy side because you know okay
let's just be upfront about it
Halloween's either time we get dressed
up really freaky to scare people you get
dressed up just to look really hot no
real talk right there to be honest so I
thought here's a really like sultry sexy
kind of FBI agents I like all black got
the gun I thought it's awesome because
you can literally use any clothes you
have from home if you've got a black
caps and aviator sunnies and the only
accessories you really need to buy would
be like a gun and holster thing like the
gun holder but you can always just like
DIY one you'll have to excuse my porks
he's for a gun I didn't actually have
like one of the proper guns no I just
used a water governor you know what
we'll just let that one slip alright so
if you guys do want to see how I did
this makeup and also if you want to see
the outfit that I paired everything with
then please keep watching first up I'm
taking my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac to
prime my eyelids and I'm just patting
this all over my lid and then I'm taking
my brand new to face chocolate bar
palette and taking the light brown color
in here to define my crease and I'm also
using this color as like a transition
shade I am literally so obsessed with
this new palette then with this slightly
darker brown color I'm going to be
patting this on to my outer V and
lightly like blending it with the brush
into my crease then I'm going to be
patting it on to my inner corner
completely like missing the center of my
lid because we're going to go back later
with a lighter eyeshadow there
then taking a big fluffy blending brush
I'm going to be blending these colors
together so it just kind of seamlessly
fades out then taking this shimmery
pearl color I'm going to be using a flat
brush to Pat it all over the center of
my lid and just lightly kind of spread
it out but not too far either side I'm
also just tapping the slider color into
my inner corner and then blending it all
out once again
oh you're learning to look good then
with the darkest brown color in the
palette I'm going to be lightly tapping
this onto my outer V again now it
doesn't really matter if you do this
messily because we're going gone going
it to blend it out after anyways I
literally cannot speak today
then taking this thin little eyeliner
brush I'm taking this brown tone and
placing it under my lash line and then
with another small brush and that pearl
kind of shimmer color I'm going back to
where we placed it and just like
lightening it up again and then with a
black eyeliner pencil I will be placing
this in my waterline then as usual for
me I love to line my eyes with liquid
eyeliner really big winged out and but
you can pretty much do whatever sort of
eyeliner you like or whatever suits your
eye shape the most once I've done that
I'm just applying some mascara before I
put on some false lashes which I'll
leave a tutorial on this down below
because I've already done a video like
explaining how to put this on in depth
so that is the eyes all done you can
make it darker or lighter depending on
what suits you then on to the face I'm
priming my face with my hourglass
mineral primer then to get rid of my
dark circles I'm taking my age rewind
and placing this right under my eyes
then since I'm faked and I'm mixing
these two foundations to get the perfect
color so I'm just pressing one pump of
each onto my Sigma flat kabuki brush and
blending it kind of like mixing it on my
hand and then buffing it all over my
skin to get a really nice flawless
finish Oh
take you far
then to set the foundation in place I'm
taking my Mac Studio Fix powder and just
patting this all over my face oh my god
I had like the itches rest ever but ok
moving in I'm just filling in my
eyebrows here and I'm not going to
bother going into depth because everyone
does it differently to get a really nice
defined face and like cheekbone area I'm
contouring my cheeks with my nice casino
bronzer and I think if you go like
really fill out with your contouring
it'll kind of make you like I don't know
like give that like sexy cop kind of
look and I'm just like blending out the
contour with a fluffier brush then
taking this um blush I think it's called
peachy keen from Mac I'm just putting
this all over my cheeks and then kind of
blending it up and with my mary-lou
manizer highlighter from the balm I'm
going to be applying quite a lot of this
right above that blush I'm also just
popping a little bit above my Cupid's
bow to give a nice shimmer
okay so then for the statement piece I'm
taking my Ruby wear MAC lipstick and I
had no lip liner because I kind of lost
mine so if I was you I'd recommend using
a lip liner because it makes it a whole
lot easier to apply this stuff but I
just took my time and somehow got this
on without making a huge mess
now you can either stop here this is
completely fine or if you want to do
what I like to do what I wanted to do
for this tutorial was take this red lip
gloss really plump up my lips and give
it that really sexy effect this is all
of the makeup done now I'll show you
what I wore for this costume pretty much
I just went for simple black on black so
I have this little like crop top which I
just crossed over at the front it has a
really cool like criss cross back some
high-waisted black pants I've chucked on
some aviators Sunny's and this like cap
that I got from a costume store and then
I just had like that little belt thing
and it went like over my body and of
course my great little water gun that
went with it all so you can pretty much
do whatever it all sort of works
together I hope you all enjoyed this
video I had so much fun doing my first
Halloween video even though it really
wasn't too
Halloween me I guess you could say a
really basic Halloween outfit but I
think it's like a really last-minute
outfit I know that I had a Halloween
party last night and I was kind of like
oh gosh what do I wear I had like
nothing so I chucked all the stuff
together and yes when I came up with if
you did like this Halloween video please
