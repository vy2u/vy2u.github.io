showing you how to put in clip in hair
extensions I'm currently wearing these
amazing 24 inch remy hair dark brown
hair extensions from best hair by comb
which I'll be speaking about their hair
extensions a little bit later so pretty
much if you want to hear little about
these extensions and also how to put
them in then please keep watching oh
this is my normal hair length normally I
wear in most of my other previous videos
you would have seen with like really
long hair that's because normally I have
weave hair extensions put in so that I
permanently weaved in recently I got
them taken out and I got my hair cut in
my hair is very short right now the
reason why I normally get hair
extensions is because I just like the
look of having longer hair better you
know it makes me feel more confident
when I've got longer hair it's kind of
weird I don't know oh ok so these aren't
my clip-in hair extensions
I've been 24 inch 10-pack clip in hair
extensions from best hair buy calm a
great range of hair extensions with like
a big range of colors and they've got
wavy ones straight ones curly ones so I
just got the straight ones but they kind
of wavy at the moment because I had them
cold yesterday
umm these extensions are so amazing it
they are so soft I just could see here
all day like
my fingers through them that's so soft
they yes clipping really well because
they've got a little silicone strip at
the bottom so I like grips onto the hair
so you don't need to like back comb your
hair to your mind yeah so pretty much
that's just a run-through of the hair
that I'm using they're 100% human remy
hair color that I have is in number two
darkest Brown which they match my hair
perfectly well now I'm going to give a
little demonstration just like really
quickly of how I clip in the hair it's
so easy it's pretty straightforward all
my hair today I'm going to tell it as
well as put any hair extensions which
since it's real Q&amp;amp;A you can do that you
can straighten it color do it on both
side of I'm taking at my little cloud9
hair straightener and just starting to
curl up my hair if you don't know how to
do this I do have a video on how to curl
your hair using a hair straightener
okay now that I've cut out my hair and
it's like fully little ringlet curls I'm
just going to not brush it out yet like
I know it looks really funny but he's
gonna wait for while I'm killing the
other hair so that these curls might
hold so they don't go to loose cold hair
all you have to do now is go and
individually curl your hair extensions
yeah so now that I have a code of my
hair extensions of my straightener
I'm going to be dividing my hair because
it's pretty much the easiest way to put
in these extensions as doing it bit by
bit
so first I'm taking a little Bulldog
clip and are we scooping my hair down to
the bottom quarter of my hair so once
you do that you let that top it up then
my first piece that I'll be taking is
the 3-foot piece very likely going to
often happen and as I slightly just lets
easy to
now I'm just going to unclip the rest of
that hair again and put it into another
section like two centimeters up from
where we just parted the first half I'm
taking the biggest clips now the four
piece one and putting that in my hair
just as you saw before
now for the third quarter of my hair I'm
going to be taking these two three-piece
clip hair extension pieces and just
clipping these to either side of my head
once you've clipped both pieces in it
should look a little bit like this then
what I like to do to blend all the
extensions together has just run my
hands through the curls now that all the
extensions are clipped in will at least
four which is kind of weird normally use
heaps since my hair has so much volume
near the top already I don't think I
need anymore otherwise it's just like
too much if I was to add another one I'd
probably add like a little two clip
right there just in the front so it adds
more there or like two one pieces there
in what I like to do is just take my
hair brush and lightly brush through all
the hair so that the curls kind of turn
into these nice like bouncy waves
this method works literally if you want
to take your hair straight you can
straighten the hair however you like to
so your hair it works is extensions are
amazing as you can see they've added so
much length like this hair super long
but like it comes in all different
lengths if you just wanted a little bit
of length or if you wanted to have it
your normal length but just like more
volume they're super awesome and as I
said they are amazingly soft I sit there
and just literally like run my hands
through my hair all day when I have them
in I just love them and you can like
pull them up and add lots of volume oh
my god this hex right on top stop taping
I highly advise ego and check out best
hair by calm you'll find so many
different great extensions all different
colors they are super long super soft
nice and thick what I love the most
about these hair extensions they're not
too heavy at all you can barely feel
that they're actually in your hair and
also the fact that they have got the
silicon industry
to hold them in your hats like gives you
peace of mind whether your hair
extensions you won't be like going along
and then they just like start slowly
slipping out because they could rip
right your hair like that's me like
tugging on it and it's fully stuffed
down so if you do want to pick up some
of these I'm going to leave all the
links down below for best hair by calm
and also what sort of extensions I got
and yeah if you have any questions
