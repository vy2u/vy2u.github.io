showing you how I apply my false lashes
so this will just be a really quick
video and I'll try and explain it in the
simplest way possible but it's really
easy all it takes is a bit of practice
so yeah let's get straight into it okay
so I'm going to be using eyelashes from
a sports girl sort of reflecting but
yeah you can see them the equipment so
you'll need small nail scissors some
tweezers and eyelash glue and I'm using
the Shu Amuro I found playing house at
their eyelash glue so it's really good
for a Down I love it ok so first things
first you just want to take the lashes
out of the box now this one comes with
glue but I don't usually like to use the
glue that they have in the in the
packages I don't feels like that as good
as other ones that you can buy when you
first get them out take note of which
side which one is on Julie it'll go
shorter to longer so this one is for the
left eye and this one is for the right
eye so it's pretty straightforward but
just make sure you do keep that in mind
so then you don't have like really long
eyelashes in like the inner corner there
and and shorter there okay so once
you've got the lashes what you can do is
my left side so I'm going to do that
first
just take your tweezers and lightly just
pull the eyelash off really gently
because it'll be just lightly stuck on
there so once you put it off of it on
the tweezer like that once you've got
the eyelash what you need to do is you
will have to test that it fits you are
kind of dropping it over the top of my
lashes
just to see where it fits where so that
I'll probably sit there and I've got
quite a bit than I need to cut off see
it's like way too long so I just take
that this is is I just estimate
whereabouts I want to cut it and hold
the other end and just snip that off so
then the last thing that you can keep it
some people like to keep it use it as
like individual but I just don't keep it
okay so that is the shorter lashes now
when they're short up they go on so much
easier and it's just less hassle as well
so I'm putting it kinda in the middle
and then just dragging that bit it
doesn't have to be perfect just an
outline to see where they'll sit so yeah
that's perfect size and never want the
eyelash to go fully in there you want it
to always kind of just sit say like a
half a centimeter away from the inside
of your eye and you don't want it to be
hanging out the back at the back at the
end either because that will make them
come off away click up so now that
you've got the lash you want to take the
glue so there's two ways to do this you
can either use a q-tip and get put the
glue on a surface
sorry about my now by the way that's
really gross I forgot to take it up you
need to put it on a surface or what I
just like to do is take the glue thin
layer of glue to the lashes this is
usually the part where everyone that
seems to get it wrong and this is where
I messed up the very first time I was
learning to apply lashes
everyone thinks that once you put the
glue on then it's just books right onto
the eye the most important part now is
you have to wait let the glue get tacky
when you do go to put it on it'll stick
straight away and it's so much easier to
work with
honestly the longer you wait the easier
it will be
and while you're waiting what I find I'm
really helpful is to just grab either
end of the lash and turn it in and just
wriggle it make the band Bend so it'll
easily just apply straight over in like
a in the shape of your eye
once you now this part getting making
sure that your waiting and you get this
part it is so easy to apply lashes it
can be a little bit fiddly but trust me
this makes it a million times easier
just waiting and waiting you can blow on
it as well whatever it you know whatever
I'm just waiting about a minute or so
for the lash to dry now once you feel as
like if you've waited long enough but
take the lash and either go really up
close tomorrow
or get a little mirror what I'm doing
now and you will need your tweezers for
this part too but for the moment to
apply them I find it easiest to hold
them in your hand just hold at the outer
corner and then what you're going to do
is with the lash you're going to hover
it over the eye and then place the
center right in the center of the eye
and push down on the outer half first
just like this and then the top kind of
is sitting up that's when you go in with
the lashes
and grab that top half or make sure okay
well first you gotta make sure that that
end half has been pushed down so just
with the back I choose the back of the
tweezer I push it down into the lash
line and really push the middle into
place you can try and get that to stick
and then go in with the front grab that
piece there and push it just right above
your real lashes and then it's been then
once you get that basic part it's all
just about fiddling with the it lashes
and pushing it down in certain areas
just to really get it to stick
now a really important part as well is
to make sure when you're putting on
lashes is that you already have some
mascara over the top of your eyelashes
now see just here it looks a little bit
funny because it's a bit clumpy there
because I had quite a lot of mascara on
before this but when you've got both
lashes on it doesn't look this money
it's just up close but I don't know you
don't need too much just go just make
sure you've got a little bit on
otherwise you can see your normal lashed
and it doesn't blend in as well
there's all just about you know patting
it into place and making sure that inner
corners definitely stuck down really
well so now that I've done one lash I'm
going to move on to the next slide the
same thing applies get your tweezers
pull the lash off gently measure it up
and cut any excess off I sort of already
know how much I'm need off so I can just
kind of estimate with that just going to
test that again where is going to see
so I'll take the large and I'm going to
bend it like before just to help apply
the glue and whenever I do put it on
it'll be in that sort of rounded shape
and then taking the glue I'm going to
apply it in layout to the band I'm just
going to while I let it dry keep curving
the band just boy though I'm placing it
just as I did before Center first and
back end and push down and with the it
tweezers go in and place the front off
and then all it takes is once you've
placed it it's just fit all around quite
a bit just keep pushing it down into the
glue dries and it will dry clear so you
in a way personally I think it's awesome
to add lashes to any look just to make
it kind of hot make the eyes look a lot
bigger you can get natural looking
lashes are really out there lashes
once you find ones that see it's pretty
easy to incorporate them with any look
so I know they can be pretty freaking I
also know that's the first time I tried
doing them but experiment a little
because they are absolutely incredible
and definitely make any loss look you
know really gorgeous so hopefully this
