I'm going to be showing you how I curl
my hair using my hair straightener so if
you'd like to find out how I do this
keep watching alright so first we just
want to start off by brushing out our
hair completely making sure there's no
knots in it and just make it nice and
smooth because we will be needing it to
be quite silky to get the curls to work
next I'm just spraying some heat
protectant spray to make sure I don't
damage my hair too much and I'm just
brushing that out with my fingers and
then going back over with my hair brush
and making sure it's all in okay so
you're going to have to excuse my really
gross blond extensions that will be
showing through this but pretty much I'm
going to be parting the hair in three so
we're going to pull up the top half and
leave the bottom half down you'll also
just want to take a clip of some sort to
keep the hair up now I'll be taking my
favorite straight into the cloud 9
straightener and I'm just straightening
out some hair because it's already been
cold as you can see basically we power
to parts we're gonna split it in two
sections and basically you clamp this
straightener down and we want to curl
away from the face so you kill back and
down back and down until you get to the
bottom of the hair it will help a lot if
your hair is a little bit silkier so
that will move through the straightener
easier and again we just want to brush
it out and we go half way down here and
flip it back down back down and again
until we get to the very end and we pull
it through
now moving on to the next slide we're
going to do the same thing I'm just
straightening that out to make it smooth
and parting into two parts again put
aside we're going to flick in towards
the face just because it can be quite
difficult when you flick out personally
I haven't mastered how to do it just yet
but if you can figure it out then go
ahead but this way still looks fine so
basically you get it you clamp down
towards halfway and you're going to
flick into the face and put down and
down again just like we did before and
it'll create a nice curl and you can run
your fingers through it okay so these
are the curls so far as you can see they
are quite tight and precise but later on
we will be brushing them out to create a
more bouncy volumize hair now just take
a hair tie and pull up that bottom half
notice unclip the rest of your hair and
I'm just going to brush it out again
just make sure there's no knots for the
next part you're going to be clipping up
the very top half of your hair so you
can move on to the middle part of
filling okay so once again excuse the
blond hair extensions they are quite
prominent here because they're layered
there but I'm going to do the same as we
did before in the previous steps just
curling it out from the face on that's
the left side of my head and just
pushing the curls to the back so I can
focus on the other ones that I've got to
do and just keep doing that and so
here's my post so you flick back and
down and back and you're just pulling
the hair through
I'm with the straightener and then
pulling it out like that
okay so now just doing the same on the
other side of the face now finishing up
at this side you want to pull out the
hair that you did before and blend it
all together then using a hair tie pull
it all up into one ponytail at the back
now unclip the third and final section
of your hair okay so I've just brushed
out this section and now I am continuing
to curl the last parts of the hair
and then as usual we just want to do the
same thing on the other side of the hair
once you're fully done pull out of the
hair this is all the hair together
curled you can either leave it like this
or continue to the next where we'll be
brushing the heart to make it wavy
firstly I just like to start by running
my fingers through the hair just to make
sure there's no knots and it just starts
to kind of make it a little bit fluffier
and I normally adjust the fringe a
little bit and puff it up a bit and just
doing that through all the hair then I
like to take my hair brush just to
really blend it all in now I know it can
seem like it wrote it like takes all of
the curl out of the hair but it doesn't
trust me
Oh
then just taking some hairspray I like
to spray a little bit over the head just
to keep it all in place your arm just a
tiny bit so that is the completed look
for how to curl your hair with using a
hair straightener hope you guys enjoyed
it leave any comments for me and I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
