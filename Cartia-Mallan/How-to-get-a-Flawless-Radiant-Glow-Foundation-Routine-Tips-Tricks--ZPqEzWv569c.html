with Rimmel London to help you guys
achieve the perfect foundation phase
today I'm going to be stepping you
through all my tips and tricks on how I
like to create a flawless canvas for my
makeup and it's some little do's and
don'ts on applying foundation powder
concealer highlighting everything you
need to know I'll cover in this video so
if you want to see how I like to do my
foundation base and get some really cool
tips and tricks then please keep
watching so as you can tell I've already
done my eye makeup but I'm zoomed you
guys in now so I can start stepping you
through kind of how I like to do my
foundation and I get a really flawless
kind of base I'm at first I freaked out
because I have a massive pimple on my
cheek but then I thought it's actually
kind of good because I can show you guys
how I like to cover blemishes when I've
got them and just kind of what works for
me
and hopefully some of the tips might
work for you guys my first massive tip
when it comes to achieving a flawless
base would always be to prime it's so
important to use a primer it helps your
foundation stand for longer and it'll
also help the application process it'll
just make it go on easier and everything
so I'm using my Rimmel lasting finish
primer and I've been using this one for
a while now I love how moisturizing it
is it makes my skin not feel too dry or
oily sometimes primers can make my skin
feel really oily and I don't like that
at all areas I like to focus my primer
is definitely around my t-zone and
mainly on my cheeks um just because this
is where I tend to notice my foundation
comes off the quickest and I get oily
sometimes around these areas I excuse my
hands they're all fake Tanny
they don't look filled so bad on camera
they're not even that bad in person so
once the prime is done everyone's kind
of different sometimes people like to
put a foundation purse or some people
like to put a conceal that I always like
to put on my concealer first so today
I'm going to be using my wake me up
concealer from Rimmel and this is in the
color classic beige sometimes I like to
use the ivory color which is another
shade lighter to get a nice highlight
now that if I don't want to have to
highlight after my foundation but just
kind of you can work off what you like
to do what kind of look it is you're
going for but today I'm just going to be
using this concealer that's closer to my
foundation skintone to just correct any
of the darkness under my eyes now a good
trick what to do is when you have a
little concealer brush like this instead
of dotting it along I like to slide it
down and this will just help when you're
blending it it'll just easily blend out
more so I slide it all the way under my
eyes and I always kind of just blend it
down a bit to cover where my cheeks are
just for some extra coverage and then
afterwards I take the detailer and I
spot it over any of those blemishes then
what I also like to do is I don't know
why there's because it's not really like
I'm not highlighting yet but I still
just like to put a bit of concealer up
here and down my nose so concealer
brushes I don't actually have a proper
concealer brush I find concealer brushes
like those little ones on the ends are
too small I like a bigger brush that's
quicker to blend out normally I use my
Sigma tapered kabuki for under-eye
concealer you can kind of get it in it
you can get right underneath your eyes I
love how you can do that so best thing
for concealer is instead of streaking it
along Pat it into the skin so then it
stays on and it gives more of a flawless
effect instead of a streaky kind of
effect so I kind of Pat across and then
slide it down a bit just sort of blend
okay now when it comes to the big pimple
areas it's pretty much same rules apply
what I like to do is with it you don't
want to move the product around too much
pull otherwise it's that
it will just swipe it straight across a
pimple the pimple you just want to Pat
it right into the skin and see as you
Pat it it's giving it more coverage so
for my foundation today I will be using
my Rimmel waking me up the foundation
and this is in the shade classic beige
this foundation is really great because
it gives a really healthy radiant glow
it has vitamin C in it which will also
help with dull looking skin but if you
did want a lighter coverage option that
will still give you a glow the BB cream
is the way to go for me what I look for
under foundation is something
lightweight which still has a nice kind
of coverage I'm really not a fan of
cakey heavy foundations I know a lot of
people aren't so that's why this one's
so not lightweight smooth consistency
and it gives such a flawless finish so
with my foundation I'll be using my
favorite flat top kabuki Sigma f80 brush
I'll be pumping one pump onto that
normally one pump is enough but if you
want more coverage
obviously it's always available so the
reason why I like to use this brush is
because of its flat top you can easily
get buff it into the skin so what I do
is I just like to put little dots all
over the place and slowly just start
patting it like you're poking at
something you just want to Pat it into
the skin because as I said it's the same
kind of concept as with the concealer if
you're smudging it and moving it all
around your face you'll end up with
lines and it'll be really uneven kind of
product placement when you're patting it
in its gonna put it in that spot and
just kind of like I know this sounds
weird but like it's in your skin like
not in your skin but like it's cementing
it in place so that's what I like to do
I just like to go across and if I've
kind of pad it enough and I'll give it
some smooth outs and blend it in come
like that a little bit like this I'm
it up but you want to initially start by
putting it in to make sure that it's
going to stay on as you can see that
foundation it just has such a nice you
know I don't even know what you'd say
like it just it it looks like my skin
it's nothing cakey young to any cake eat
lines I always always always set in my
foundation with a powder I don't think
I've ever not set it with a powder um
powder is awesome because it'll just
hold all of your foundation in place
when you've got liquid foundation on
your face if you sweat it's gonna just
sweat straight off with it so powdering
your face is awesome if you have
troubles with keeping your foundation on
so um or if it's a hot day or if you
want a modified finish powder is just
your all-in-one everything and also adds
more coverage so I also like if I don't
want to apply too much liquid foundation
I'll put on more powder just to make
sure I get everything covered up and
it's a nice flawless finish so I'm using
my Rimmel London lasting finish powder
foundation and this one is in the color
silky beige we've had I always start in
this section covering with a highlight
areas I'll take the powder brush and
I'll cut it in place and then kind of I
blend it in a circular motion down so I
can't Pat it out and then blend it down
just making sure I'm also covering my
neck to set the foundation we put down
there across that pimple what you want
to do is take the powder again and Pat
it in place and make sure you just blend
all around it so there's not massive
like step or powder next I'll be moving
on to bronzer I'm going to be using my
Rimmel London natural bronzer is in the
color Sun bronze this one is a matte
bronzer and I always use a matte bronzer
up first when I want to contour my face
I always contour my face I think it adds
a lot of definition to the structure of
everything and I make sure my compound
of love my sauce so I love to use my
Real Techniques blush brush I like this
because in form this into any shape you
want I often use my finger to clamp it
in
better for contouring or to really open
it up and blend it out then I like to
bring the bronzer up onto my forehead
and it you kind of want to do like a
three like I kind of imagine it is like
down but you also want to touch on the
bottom of your jawline just to define it
all in together
once all the bronze is done and once
you're happy with how your base is
looking so far if you want you to go
ahead and apply some blush I always
apply blush I think it actually fully
completes your look because it's
bringing some color into your face after
you put all the neutral skin Tonee
colors on I always like to use a kind of
natural pinky color blush it's kind of
what suits me the best or kind of
bronzer blush but I'll be using my
Rimmel London blush in genuine plum and
it's such a pretty busy pink color I
guess you could say and I'll be doing
their slick bye
so either LOX cheek finish blusher I
always like to do is give a little smile
and find the apples of my cheeks and I
start by patting on today and then I
lightly blend it up over the top of my
cheekbones it adds a really nice flushed
pinky tone there now since that's
everything for how I like to achieve a
perfect base I'll quickly be applying
some lipstick and I'm just using the
equals Kate Moss collection and this is
in the color 113 it's so nice these
lipsticks smell absolutely amazing like
yummy and sweet like cherries or
something it's not everything for my
face completed obviously if you like to
be a bit more chewy you can add some
highlighter or anything else that you
might like going to answer a few little
questions that I got asked on the
Instagram photo that I posted just
asking you guys like what are some
questions or problems that you have with
getting a perfect basically your
foundation starts the best ways for
getting my foundation to stay on for
longer um
as I mentioned in this video primer is
your number one best friend for that it
helps that so much and also if you find
a good setting spray I like to use the
Urban Decay all nighter spray and I find
that really holds all my foundation in
there's all sorts of makeup setting
sprays and powder as well is your best
friend you can also keep it in your bag
throughout the day powder is really easy
just to whip out and get your brush and
quickly Pat it all over the places that
are kind of going oily or their makeups
coming off and it'll just mattify your
face and make it look all fresh again so
I think I've pretty much touched on
everything I wanted to cover today I
hope this video helped you guys in how
to get the perfect base massive thank
you to Rimmel London for sending me out
some products and I got to play with all
those products are absolutely amazing I
use them in my own makeup kit really
