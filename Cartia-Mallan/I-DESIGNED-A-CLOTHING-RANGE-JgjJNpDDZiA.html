well so literally go click off the video
right now and sign up so you don't miss
out because I promise you
well not to get ahead of myself but it's
all gonna sell very fast so you guys
hope you want to know what the range is
what my inspiration for was and when I
sat down with the design team
try to come up with ideas or when I was
I guess pitching my ideas I just wanted
to go for pieces that I don't have in my
wardrobe and you guys know I have a very
unique style you know what stuff I love
so I wanted to like kind of bring that
to life and so that you guys can all
have pieces of things that I love like I
don't know how to explain that but
everything's pretty much just a big mix
we've got pants crops you know I love
wearing pants
I love high-waisted pants you always ask
me where do you get any pants from and
then you can find my pants so a lot of
it is really kind of bright and quirky
good for festivals coming up obviously
you guys know I love festival style so
I've tried to bring some festival
elements into this while still keeping
it casual enough that you can go and
wear on the streets
we've got pops of color and it's just
just a range to try and bring some life
and fun into your wardrobe and make you
feel fabulous when you when you're just
cruising about honestly and obsessed
with every single piece I'm amazed by
all of it and I just keep looking over
there it's my little baby okay so the
most exciting part about this range is
that it is available in sizes sizes 6 to
16 so there is something for everyone in
this and I really was very aware of like
you guys know I love wearing clothes
that make me feel confident that I'm
comfortable in my body wearing them so
these are just really nice bits and they
sit really really what totally loves the
best little piece of info is that
princess probably also ships worldwide
so everyone no matter where you are can
have pieces so let's just jump in just
showing you guys the clothes which looks
probably why you feel oh oh my god I
love it both you guys through the whole
range now and this is one of the pieces
just had to put it on because it's
literally the cutest thing in the world
I am and we're gonna I'm just gonna say
yep the range is all behind me and we're
gonna talk through let's start with the
first peach very bright very colorful
very me so this is my first piece
definitely an excuse to taxon sobrang
it's not happening this is the bubble
banjo a little inside story behind the
name my nickname growing up has been
Bubba my brother still calls me bub art
my mom my dad
everyone in my family it only felt right
to call the one piece that feels like
most me the Bubba banjos so this is a
full rainbow bender I love little crops
it's very summery very cute and the most
fun detail we've added on this is the
little star at the zip and that's just
really cute you can wear this that way
around that way around these double ones
so you don't have to wear a bra
everything's going to sit up really well
and if you've watched my videos you know
that is very important to me I like to
not wear a bra with absolutely anything
so but I also just want to talk about
the tag as well because I think it's
actually the cutest thing I've ever seen
little alien Katya in this and I hadn't
seen anything cool like this out there
anywhere and I wanted you guys to have a
little piece of something unique that
you can also hold on to that you can
keep whatever I like to throw it out if
you want but like I would definitely
keep this it's really cute there's a
little rainbow in the background I've
got my stuff under there like it's just
really crazy that I have an anime
version of me on the tag so yeah I'm
really excited about that I've never
seen it anywhere else before and any
next piece is actually a set in orange
let it seemed to talk to us this is I
actually get so excited about the color
of this because I love orange clothing
pieces but it's like a fine line between
getting the perfect orange so this is
like a very fruity kind of like I don't
even know how I would explain it but it
is the most perfect orange it's that
orange color that makes you look like
tan and glowy and you stand out you very
vibrant so yes this is a little set this
little crop it kind of sells itself it's
got adjustable straps which is perfect
for me it's double lined so once again
don't have to wear a bra the adjustable
straps are so good because this is going
to work on anyone's body like wherever
your chest sits you can kind of like
make this into whatever you want it to
be if you want to sit low or high are
tied up we've got a little zipper at the
back as well and it's just it's just
cute and to the pants we have these
high-waisted little culottes in the same
area as well see the sole temporally so
you can mix and match sizing for the
tops and bottoms of so anyone that's are
amazing I why I like them so much is
that they
one of the ways they're very like they
don't hug you too tightly that it looks
like fluttering they hug them in the
right spots and it's really nice and
loose and flowy if but a little pockets
on the sides a little set it's all made
of linen so it's a very luxury fabric I
agree the gold shuck the summer it's
nice and cool and I just love this set
but I want to tell you guys the name of
this set this is called the strawberry
moon and I just said to lay like why did
I call this strawberry moon do you think
I quote like I don't I think my first
idea was fruit tingle they told me a
story with a moment to this venue and it
was clothes jewelry moon and so I
immediately wrote that down in my notes
so obvious that did look at strawberry
moon wanted to make a design something
that is for you guys that don't want to
be in something that's extremely bright
I know it's not everyone's taste but on
this it's a little beige and what kind
of strut set I think it's very like
Island lifestyle that I was going for I
could imagine myself wearing this was
like beautiful gold necklaces laid and
walking by a beach or a bra just
something really cute and same tail
exactly as I thought as the other orange
one again it's linen and super
breathable some on and this set is cold
I love the summer love set but you can
buy it separately so this is the summer
love talk that was some
and I could not do this range we have a
split off Huxley and fled and a little
bralette so this is for all my disco
ladies my festival go is this is
actually for anyone but so this is the
super stop set so these absolutely self
less this is one of them they are super
flat out I'm like a flip phonetic but I
could not do this without some players
in it because I wish list the base of it
is like a black flag with a little
sparkly kind of covering over it super
super stretchy we're really comfortable
like elastic band around the way so
speed you when you're blooded this is
double lined and this was really
important for me because I know for a
fact if I want my stomach to look ty and
I want to look nice and sleek he in my
Flair's having double lines last
pulls everything in and makes it really
nice well still a comfortable so that
was key for me it's just the convience
things ever and I cannot wait to sell
this either with a little bra that I'm
going to show you boy you can put this
with a banty you put this with sickening
it's good for a festival a night out
like appeals it's just the QC so they
are super super glittery as you can see
so you're gonna like shine in the lights
and I'm obsessed with this I honestly
know so much planning brought let's that
actually support my boobs I have bigger
boobs it's very hard most for all that I
like these tiny little things that they
like of you this may look small and not
very cumbersome
covers them but I promise you this kind
of scoops you in and hold you really
nicely it has the adjustable straps in
the back and also clip here clips here
which have three little settings you can
put them on so for all the fits of these
pieces they have all been sampled on me
they worked and put on a different model
everything was sampled on me so I made
sure that we went back a few times to
adjust the strap length the sizing that
would cut everything for all of the
pieces really important for me to have
some pieces of swim because I know how
hard it is for me to find somewhere that
I actually love excited to show you guys
this is the tipsy swim wear swim pieces
we can't spit the pixie bikini so I'm
gonna talk through it's a high-waisted
bikini bottom and the little old bikini
crop this the cut of this bikini top is
the exact same as the cut of the crops
added to wear this this is like a little
lollipop drain that has a little clip at
the back we've got adjustable straps yep
they're thick adjustable straps so
you're going to be very supported so
these are the bottom you guys know I
love high waisted stuff it's super
comfortable and really secure in it and
the most exciting part that I've added
this see this is like something really
different but I've added these little
little crisscross suicide
is like showing that why I've done this
and you wait till you try it on some
people may not believe me it actually
adds a super fluttering and kind of
define the look when you wearing bikinis
because if this was completely striped
all the way around sometimes it can make
you look throw it off having a little
cut up there like to tailor your body
and give you a really beautiful curved
look so this was like something I really
want to add in to the bikini set because
it's different it's really fun and I
just think personally on me I like the
way that it shapes my body but it makes
them look at me like that
so you can get different sizing for the
bottom and the top because I know not
everyone is the same size necessarily
the next piece is named after my
beautiful mother this is the chimera
throat and we needed this to comfort we
worked on this top so many times to get
the colors right you wouldn't think it'd
be so hard to get the perfect rainbow it
is trust me
so we went back like three or four times
to try and get the coloring of this
right I'll show you guys what we ended
up with it looks so vibrant did like a
little ripped edge on the bottom so it
looks super kind of 70s like messy like
I just cut this myself vibe but it looks
really good mom jeans it doesn't look
too like Taylor than perfect which is
definitely what I wanted for this you
guys know in rainbow obsessed I have
been looking for a crop like this just
so long
so obviously I just had to design one
for myself mom's going back I came back
to be really sorry
okay next we have the kaleidoscope dream
this is fun and it's also glittery and
just orange obviously you can tell I
love so this is also like another kind
of crop inspired by disco kind of I'm
kind of wanted to bring disco and a boho
style together because I think that's
kind of me uh-huh so it's a little tire
run up of the pair this with either my
orange crop underneath with the pens or
else you could do like a really cute
black lace bra let a white bra my
favorite piece of this is the bell flood
sleeves and the next step we have this
moves a little good and the top set up
says this is the CEO he said it's up to
my best friend Cioffi
um we both share a love of the stuff and
each roll of the stars and I just think
this is so unique and quirky just like
selfie if you guys obviously you've
probably seen her in all my videos she
is the little quirky yell so we needed a
quirky little set so let me talk you
through the top first you've seen this
style you seen this cut it is the exact
same deal as all the other ones this is
what the print looks like I've got a
black and white checkered stripe
underneath and some really cute black
stars I could not do this range without
some stars in it because they are my
Holy Grail I love everything with stops
when I have so many jewelry pieces and
clothes so this is really cute the skirt
this is the most flattering skirt cut I
I promise you don't wear skirts that
often but when I do they will always be
this cut because I feel like they taper
in your waist really nicely they're not
hugging you uncomfortably anywhere and
they just take it out they tape it out
to your leg you can actually sew it's
not even it's not where your body comes
good it's and it's not loose either so
it's just that's in between point so
once again you can buy at the top and
bottom different sizing so I would also
even pair this disc with the collapse
perk dream talk or with the orange set
next we have our just two very simple at
very cute easy little cross so I have
the rainbow crop because they had a cute
little embroidered rainbow on it and
next I have because macaque because they
just said cosmic on it
so the inspire behind that cosmic crop
is actually see Oakley has the cutest
touch whatever on her wrist that says
cosmic and when I saw her I just fell in
love with it and then this one is just
obviously a cute little rainbow from I
have like that memory to me but I wanted
something even more simple that's just
nice to just throw on and just easy so
go through these that double bind
they've got adjustable straps nice thin
strap so it's perfect for summer
and the perfect like mom jeans black
jeans collects anything is arranged
they're just easy versatile pieces and
it is very me I love them and now I have
one more really exciting piece of swim
for you guys I couldn't do something
without some let the print so this is
the Milan swim piece one piece and it
has a really cute little tie up bath
going on here we've got like a low-cut
bottom and it really is such a nice cut
on your bootay and then it also has the
adjustable straps so it's fits for
everyone and we've got a really high cut
70s 80s kind of vibe going on with the
bottom piece I also designed this so
that you can wear it as a bodysuit so I
actually want to say love this with
jeans or with the orange what so it
looks really cute it's just the perfect
cut well that's a looking like that so
yeah swim or what I said I'm super
versatile leather here mix arrow in the
super hot it's like my favorite print
baby coastin sterling yes they're doing
this bloody video then we have the
accessories that I will talk more about
so we have two hats I've got the cherry
bomb babe but I cannot do this rate
without having a hat you guys know where
Rhoda hats all the time I never seen a
red stylist ever before but it'd be
really cute to have like a statement
heart piece like this same with my
little gray I've been obsessed with
various for the longest time this suit
in style and I wanted to do something
really unique and having it leather prep
area so this is my chin kisses frere and
it's super fluffy and soft and it just
looks so cool with literally everything
so that so that is the range everyone so
that is the collection make sure you
