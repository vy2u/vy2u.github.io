literally just been editing I'm
exhausted I've edited so many videos
today and say that's what's happening
and not sure where we're going for
dinner yet
okay so I've just gotten home oh my god
I have to explain so last night we um I
was with Yazzie and we went to 8th
Street markets and got some food and
stuff and just as I went to film I
remembered that I left my camera at
Yaz's house I was like oh my god you're
kidding and my phone was completely like
full like all the storage was full so I
couldn't film in there either
so I had to just let that one that's
slip and then last night we just got
back together to have so much to move in
like did nothing so I wasn't really
bothered to film it anyways but today I
wanted to go to barn really badly and I
might still be able to if I get all this
editing done if I'm gonna sit down edit
now it's like 7:30
I'm exhausted excuse my bags and whatnot
but peps I can get this editing done
maybe just go down to the beach
somewhere really quickly and just have a
dip before the weekends Oh God
yeah that's what's happening pretty
boring this weekend sorry guys ok so I
finished a lot and a lot of editing and
gotten all my stuff together and yeah
he's on our way here now we're both
gonna go into the city because we need
to get shoes for Blues first cuz we've
got tickets for next week on Thursday
and all of my shoes are breaking from
previous festivals so I need to get some
more reliable ones that aren't gonna
like kill my feet when I walk so
couldn't do that and grab some lunch and
and yeah that's all yeah see you know
I've just come up here to eat
sushi move up with you we've been
looking for shoes and I can't find
anything that I want and I don't want to
spend one hundred seventy dollars on a
pair of boots they're gonna get
destroyed at a festival so I think I'll
just make you up what I've got guys need
to get work clothes and then yeah I
don't know why important at all
