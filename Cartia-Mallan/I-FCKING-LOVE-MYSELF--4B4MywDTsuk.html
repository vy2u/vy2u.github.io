I love myself enough to know what I
deserve I love myself enough to know
what feels right for me I also love
myself enough to stand up what I believe
in and I also love myself enough to
stand up to people that make me feel
like shit
and people that don't treat me as an
equal human being I love myself to do
the things that I love I love myself
enough to also limit myself on things
that I don't need I love myself to
surround myself by people that love me
and people that treat me right the list
could literally go on forever because as
the title says I fucking love myself
what I'm talking about today is not at
all a egotistical obnoxious or cocky
subject at all it's all really centered
on how I actually got to this point
think kardea a year ago would never
imagine herself saying what I just said
I never had this amount of love for
myself last year and I didn't think it
was that all necessary and I never even
thought of it as a priority the idea of
loving yourself and the reason why this
topic may seem a bit random but the fact
that it's not spoken about enough
definitely freaks me out of it I'm
talking about this today because I'm not
seeing enough of it at all I'm not
seeing barely any of it to be honest
obviously my job involves putting myself
out there on screen talking to people in
person and posting photos taking photos
filming things and it's all this whole
world of like I am showing myself to
other people and I went into this being
a complete insecure mess I do knock
myself really at all and so when
comments were fighting me it would
always get me down I'm at a point now
where I've taken the time to actually
get to know me get to love me to be at a
point where things don't affect me
anymore harsh words that have said to me
literally brush off my shoulder and I
don't just
say that it's actually true it's like
there's no longer a little vacuum in me
that wants to hear negative stuff is
simply when the negative stuff comes in
it just it just like completely brushes
out I want to talk about how you
yourself can get to that point because
the messages I get bombarded with 24/7
nearly every day of my tumblr inbox all
my comments on my Instagram page you get
to be so confident how did you get to
the confidence you have today how can I
stop hating myself how can I embrace the
body I'm in how can I embrace the person
I am how can I find my own individual
style how can I just be me and isn't it
crazy that people are coming to me off
how can I just be me because I mean no
one can actually tell you how to just be
you you are the only person that really
knows you but have you ever connected
with that have you ever touched base
with you like have you ever asked
yourself how am i doing how am I feeling
what do I need what do I want a lot of
the time we don't because we're taught
ever since we're young that having any
care for your inner self or ever really
backing yourself completely ever really
just loving yourself fully is an
egotistical or cocky thing me coming up
to up front being like I fucking love
myself most people would be like look at
this cocky bitch but it doesn't have to
be that way I'm not saying I love myself
in a way like I'm better than someone
I'm saying I love myself because I'm
validating me I'm happy in my skin I'm
happy in my body I'm happy with the
person I am today I'm happy of my growth
I'm proud of my growth I I think people
get stuck in their mind because they
think the person they are right this
very moment is the person they're going
to be in years time people change it is
a big method when people like this
person's never going to change and it's
like there's always hope your mind is
the strongest and most powerful thing
ever and inside of you you could be the
most horrible and negative person and
there is still always hope that you got
being the most positive person ever
everyone has a chance to blossom and
form into someone who they really are
I'm going to read out kind of what I
started writing when I sat down to give
myself a guideline for this video and I
normally try and get myself a guideline
for what to say too but um I kind of end
up ramp
so I'll just go off what I actually
started writing we brought up to tell
ourselves to constantly improve and
change change who we are change what we
love change what we believe in other
people's views are smashed on to us ever
since we're young it is seen as cocky or
obnoxious to love yourself or to back
yourself people always want to try and
bring you down only ever out of jealousy
it is true most of the time that I've
ever gotten hate I've ever had negative
people impact me in some ways when
they've been jealous and any time I've
ever been cruel to people
I can also pinpoint it back to my own
jealousy inside this is in our human
nature this is how I raise because we
can be sour and we can be stubborn and
we can be really really cruel humans can
be cruel and we all have power within us
to do that but we also have more power
light as always so much stronger than
darkness we all have power in us to be
amazing humans and to spread positivity
and to spread it within ourselves if you
can't spread it to others at least find
it within you what I have written under
that is mind power line with an
exclamation mark your mind I don't know
how many times I have to say your mind
is one of the most powerful tools you
have if you let it fuck with you though
then it can become an absolute mess at
the moment what kind of spurred on this
kind of thought about the mind is a few
things one I started meditating my
friend Michelle Fox kind of came in and
so I'd teaching me about meditation and
I have a video on that coming later but
one of the main things that she actually
brought up was saying you are not your
mind um you're a completely different
person
from your mind your mind does not
control you and you are not all the
negative feelings that your brain is
telling you you're not all the horrible
things that it's saying to you if that
makes sense like when when you hear your
brain saying or you're fat you're ugly
you're shit you shouldn't do that you
should do this when you have that
control in your head it is not you
speaking it is that little evil voice
inside of you you are bigger than that
you're beyond your brain if you think
about it in this way actually no no
first I'm going to read out this this
little part in this in this book that
just like hit a nail on the head about
it and this will definitely
this will lead onto my next thing the
mind is a superb instrument if use
rightly use wrongly however it becomes
very destructive to put it more
accurately it is not so much that you
use your mind wrongly you usually don't
use it at all it uses you this is the
disease you believe that you are your
mind this is the delusion the instrument
has taken you over the thing is we
honestly and I used to believe that I
that my mind controlled my everything
that I was the person inside my head
saying horrible things about myself and
about other people being judgmental
being egotistical being cruel to others
and putting others down in my own head
to make myself feel better to make
myself rise above that the thing is that
your brain is just another organ like
your heart it's just all there to help
your body keep running as humans we are
bigger than that you yourself a bigger
than just your brain your you'll be on
that your consciousness is much more
beyond that but sometimes it's hard to
see that I mean we're all interconnected
freaking beings like you could say we're
bloody aliens if you really wanted to
but somehow we're here and there's no
explanation so all I feel is that humans
and I have a much stronger power than
just thinking in your head you can
connect with people with this I almost
feel like it's like in a layer above us
that connects us to there or to there
like outside of our body when you put it
into perspective of saying that your
brain is just like your heart or just
like your the veins and your skin it's
all just there to keep it pumping and to
process knowledge and all different
sorts of things when you can
differentiate yourself from your brain
and from all the evil thoughts that it
has then you can sit above it and you
can just watch over your brain saying
these things and the first step is
literally just letting yourself know
that you are not your mind and if you
guys want to kind of look more into that
and you want to know more stuff about
that I honestly highly recommend reading
this book the power of now speaks about
freeing yourself from your mind rising
above thought I want to give you guys
tips or different things to maybe wake
your brain up or wake that that high
consciousness that you have up to this
fact you understand that you are not
here to please everyone you were here on
your own
individual journey in life so this in
videos I've said it to so many people
I've repeated myself on this exact thing
so many times I think it is so important
and I'm going to keep saying it until it
starts sinking into people's heads you
are born alone on your own individual
journey you do not owe anyone anything
there is no real book ever given to you
from the start
there is no instructions there is
nothing all you have is prior knowledge
from other people other humans that have
lived earlier than you information that
they are telling you that they've
experienced what they believe so when
you're on people's own opinions on
fucking everything is being put into
your head and it's fine I mean you have
to learn somehow this is how we learn as
humans we're evolved and we are taught
by people around us some people are
luckier than others they may be
influenced by people with more positive
outlooks or with people with more stable
lives or with a better income or with
great living situations other people may
also not have the greatest the most
positive people around them they may
have a really crappy living situation we
all have positives and negatives from
the minute we're born and these are
instantly put onto us what you have to
learn through life is no matter how shit
your situation may be how should you
think it may be is 100 sin true that
someone else has a worse situation and I
can guarantee you that if you're sitting
here watching this on a laptop sitting
under a roof right now we have
technology first off so back to what I'm
saying it people's opinions and views
are instantly put onto you and through
life we are each individual is such a
powerful person because if you think
about it when you grow up you actually
learn more and you grow then you're like
oh actually I'm really passionate about
art I love art or I love poetry I love
writing I love swimming I love running
it horses I don't know you just like
people all have different likes people
all have different things that like
switch their brain on a switch their
body on and make them excited some
people hate the beach some people love
cold weather some people hate color that
we're not all the same no one is the
same person we're all born differently
and I totally believe we all have
different past lives that affect us in
different ways in this current life and
everything that happens in your life
should be taken as just a lesson never
think of anything as a horrible why this
has happened to me in my life sucks
anything shit that happens to you should
just take and say what can I learn from
this move back on to my main point um if
you have something within you that is
saying go and do this the more you block
it and the more that evil voice in your
brain tells you that you can't or if you
keep listening to the people around you
and saying you can't do something then
that's when this self-love and the self
empowerment and so if anything is pushed
to the side because you're caring too
much about what other people have to say
and the limitations they're putting on
you maybe I understand situationally
that sometimes you can't go out and do
something you want it could depend on
your age money it could depend on
anything but you can always start
planning you can always start actively
doing something and you know the first
thing you should always do before you
step out on a big venture before you
really commit to this journey of finding
yourself and loving yourself and being
one with yourself is just connecting
with yourself
my journeys taken about three years to
really get here being completely honest
with you I don't talk about a lot from
my teenagers because they were not
climbers they're nothing like my life
right now I was about twenty kilos
heavier than I am now I was a overweight
child from a very young age I have lived
with being overweight I've lived with
being bullied for my way and my parents
and I mean I always made great friends
because I have the personality I have
I've always been the person I am but I
always used to get swept by other
people's views very easily it made me
extremely hateful and I wasn't I wasn't
very negative but I was more negative on
myself and I started to listen to
everything that people had to say about
me and I'm once I removed the toxic news
from my life and once I discovered that
I was more important than what their
view on me was and that I wanted to live
a happy life I was so unhappy with in my
body within my what I was doing to
myself I used to just eat to make myself
feel better
I had emotional weight just literally
just like leeching onto me once I
removed the negative people from my life
and I
I took the first step to loving myself
by is which is removing the people that
don't love you and don't support you
then that's when I realized I was like
I'm going to start exercising I'm going
to eat healthy I'm going to treat my
body the way it should be treated so the
weight started falling off as I had a
more positive input in my life and then
as I grew I kept telling myself by good
people I started to write down my
thoughts and feelings I started to
experiment with different things that
really made my heart happy
I discovered that I loved the ocean it
was as simple as that but it was such a
big impact because I knew where I could
go to make myself happy I discovered I
love filmmaking I discovered I loved um
acting I discovered that I loved public
speaking I loved to help people and that
was something that I discovered through
my own journey I think lots of teenagers
get wrapped up in the superficial view
of themselves we all care too much about
the external view of this like how we
look what clothes were wearing what
other people think about us and it's so
easy to get caught up in I still get
caught up in it sometimes nowhere near
as much as I used to what's important is
this I think lots of people jump over
the the seriousness of mental health
people people literally skip mental
health they think it's the last thing to
think about they think their brain can
just take it your brain and your mind is
sensitive just fall off a cliff at any
point in time and you won't even see it
coming
the more you keep abusing your brain
doing it straight more fucked up you
will become if you start treating your
brain with kindness and with love it'll
blossom and it'll grow and it'll only
feed you good stuff the more you keep
sending negativity and hatred to your
body from your mind and allowing it to
do that the more it's gonna Fester
depression anxiety paranoia
schizophrenia all this crap is bottled
up from your brain all this self-doubt
just keeps manifesting in there and it's
going to just become harder to ever
improve whatever change medication you
don't need that shit to get rid of
depression and anxiety and all that crap
it all just takes you have it within you
you can help yourself you do not need
you to suppress the shit and needs to
come up and you need to face it
first off face your demons and then
start finding ways to put positivity
back into your body the best example I
can always give is when I moved out by
myself to Bern I had to face the fact
that I didn't ever speak about my
emotions for about like seven years of
my life when my parents divorced I
pushed down every single feeling I had
all the sadness all the anger all of the
misunderstood feelings within me I
pushed them down and would never talk
about I bottle my issues for someone
like I always thought that I was on top
of my shadow because I could always talk
about my problems but I have
vulnerability problems I have problems
with letting people know how I feel and
was showing people that I'm not always
okay and the moment I did that and I
opened up to that and I allowed myself
to be a normal human and I stopped
putting pressure on myself this is where
I grew I could finally be alone with
myself without overthinking I could
actually quite and down that voice in my
head is where my love and my passion for
different things started to develop I
did in that time when I first moved to
bone to develop this and to develop that
love that is now all through my body and
it's only going to keep growing from now
because I know how to work on it but
what I did and different tools you guys
can use is writing is really great
getting your feelings onto paper and
just when you're writing it's just like
the words flow it could be negative it
could be hateful it could be amazing but
they're getting out at least they're
getting somewhere journaling it's
actually very therapeutic and it can
really help to track your journey I also
think reading different books like you
know the power of non self I've only
I've never really been able to read it I
definitely used to always find a massive
block I would get bored I just couldn't
connect with it and I think it was
because my mind wasn't at a point where
I was ready to take in that information
like I needed to be at a point to first
allow it to seep in and now I feel like
this is why this book's just come into
my life now and I can actually read also
think another really important thing is
just having a balanced lifestyle eating
right and exercising properly meditation
is also a really great tool to use and
just you just have to commit to one to
be better and also commit to that wanna
have a good life and you want to just
it's all it's just like if you want to
lose weight you know you get up you eat
healthy
you exercise you go to the gym like you
have a routine you should have a routine
for your own self love and for wanting
to get to a point where you can love
yourself have goals have ambitions for
it and write them down and and manifest
it manifestation is the biggest key and
it's almost like magic money like you
can make anything happen for yourself
when you treat yourself right when you
treat others right and when you just
have a good
you just have good energy around you the
universe will look after you and you
will be able to look after you as well
because you've got yourself and then the
people you want to attract will then
come because you're giving out amazing
energy I don't even know if this shit
makes sense but yes I just encourage you
to connect more with yourself and with
the world around you and then you will
eventually find all that self-love
you'll find a way to stop comparing
yourself to others and you'll realize
that you're never going to be anyone
else but yourself this is the body
you've been born into this is the mind
that you've been placed with and you can
always change it you can always grow and
never think that just your current
situation is the the end final
destination but I just want to end this
on a little quote that I found that
actually Florence and the Machine post
it is really random I didn't even know I
followed her on Instagram but I think
it's from it's from a book Salt
apparently I'll leave it linked below
once I figure out what it is but the
quote is I love myself the quietest
simplest most powerful revolution ever
and it's true once you find it maybe
right now this might not make sense to
you but once you find it you'll actually
realize that once you found inner peace
and inner love and connection with you
the world seems like a fucking magical
place and it's a lot better and it's a
lot more positive and you can finally be
you can give off so much greatness and
you can then help others and I can't
even express to you how great the
feeling of helping others is and
actually just being a good human and
being positive and giving back and I
think it's so important this is not only
important for young girls or young boys
but for adults as well like your mom's
and your dad's and stuff like everyone
is just somewhat tormented by other
people around them and I think it's
important to just know that you are
enough as the person you are right now
right today there's always a place for
positivity and happiness within you and
you'll get there and you'll find it and
I act like I am so excited to hear maybe
some reports of people that are already
out there kind of like on their journey
to like self-love or like self
empowerment it's different for everyone
but I think you should just find a
routine that works for you quick example
mine is getting up normally like making
healthy breakfast if I can fit an
exercise it makes me feel good to
meditate to maybe read for a little bit
do something I enjoy before I then have
to do work and just writing less and
being organized as well but then having
time to be spontaneous and having time
to enjoy enjoy my life and enjoy the
people around me and stuff so it's Auto
smart balance yeah if you like this
don't forget to share it with other
people around you spread this message
and spread the positivity and don't
forget to give it a thumbs up leave any
comments below I'd love to know your
thoughts and yeah I'll see you guys next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
