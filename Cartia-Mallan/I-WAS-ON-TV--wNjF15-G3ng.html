pouring down rain is freezing cold we
were not expecting this at all that's
actually water just flying out from
everywhere we just picked up the hi car
and we've got the heater blasting and
we're about to go and pick up late
picking up and then we're gonna go get
some dinner and yeah that's what's on
the agenda
okay so just had breakfast no but I'm
waiting on it can't even talk getting
nervous on my way to the studio now and
then so I want to get there I'm getting
my hair and makeup done and then I'll go
live at 10:30 ready and I feel stay
tuned shooting myself look where we are
Chanin and studios
with the base body bay and we're about
to go on how long we've got like a
minute I mean I kind of came a little
bit and I gue they just turn it like the
hair and makeup you could someone else
do all right well cool let's do this
well they need to see me
just heading to go I'm sorry I'm gonna
show me Randall The Beeches library
just go back to my a nice place it was
actually freezing today Harun I just
went driving around he show me all the
beaches and all the places run there and
then we hung out with his other friend
Nick and went down to Bondi and got some
dinner and stuff and then a big disaster
to happen Nick's dad had to be rushed to
hospital and inside to be dropped home
so I can fit people in the car just all
this crazy stuff but I'm home now and
I'm freezing and tomorrow mum and I are
gonna be looking at houses in like sorry
hills and around the place to try and
find a house to buy and probably catch
up with some other friends and stuff and
yeah do some my theatre or summat now
fun night Anna in the car it's literally
that cold that we're getting frosty
bread mum and I are just heading it to
side hills and get some breakfast and
then we're going at to Paddington first
I think and just around the place um
look at some houses and units and stuff
in between I probably go look at some
vintage stores and up shops and get some
splendour outfits sausage and yeah
so we just stopped in Bondi Vinnies and
I got two shirts so now we're going to
the next inspection to see the half else
okay so mom and I have just looked at
the house and it was so cute but there
was no cupboard space so it makes it
really hard because we're not a couple
we're not gonna dedicate one room to a
wardrobe we needed a third room for our
wardrobe yeah that's the struggle right
now so just went shopping so classic me
I ended up missing my first flight at 4
o clock and we had to catch the 6
o'clock flight because I got distracted
shopping
anyways so the flight was really nice it
was such a beautiful sunset
and then the minute that I landed I
quickly raced home and dumped my bags
then I had to go to an art exhibition
opening
she won't text me like just the Frog on
the flight was like sent me in a dress
and I roped up and it was amazing night
the art is by Jay economist and it was
so cool seeing all the artwork and
hanging out some friends so here's some
shots from that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
