and not filmed like a sit-down video in
so long hi guys oh my god it was very
weird I haven't filmed a proper sit-down
video in the longest time ever but I
think we are well and truly overdue for
a Q&amp;amp;A and just a general catch-up chat
because we haven't we haven't just sat
down and had lunch a teenager just got
back from my trip to New York LA Milan
London and my trip was absolutely
amazing it was surreal Sage's I'm very
happy to be home I was exhausted when I
got back but I'm gonna give you guys
fill you in on everything that was kind
of going on when I was overseas so it's
gonna be like a life update /qa because
I have a bunch of questions from you
guys too I guess I'll just start with my
trip to America so pretty much my
manager set up a trip to go over to New
York and LA as a work trip my manager
Tess is absolutely amazing I think you
guys might have seen her in some of my
Instagram
so I set up a trip pretty much to meet
up with the IMG officers in New York and
LA it's like IMG /w Emmys what they call
it over there and pretty much as you
guys know I've started acting for ages
it's a massive passion of mine and
something that I really wanted to get
into this year so we went over for
meetings to sign with the agencies over
there because they have more more of a
link with acting stuff so WME is more
like acting presenting that type of
thing but yeah I went to go meet with
the officers out to do some other
meetings with different brands and
different people and I have really
exciting news it's so crazy to me
and like I didn't know this was
happening when I was going over but it
literally is pinched myself dream but
the New York officers have assigned me
and so the LA offices and London so it's
crazy to me that now I
I have agents in New York LA and London
so like what just insane so I guess
shortly I'll be applying for my American
visa so I can work over in America you
go for castings for acting staff and
just expand I guess on what I'm doing
right now because there's a lot more for
what I want to do than just YouTube an
Instagram there's so many different
things and exciting things that you guys
are obviously involved in that I can
create or just expand on to take you
know this thing that we've created
online and make it something amazing and
so more people can hear things and I can
spend more a message or just activate
more things and also do things that I'm
really passionate about in terms of the
acting or creative direction and I'll
just music industry stuff and all that
yeah you go now international phone
plans I kind of I guess later on the New
York on live over in America for two
months or so just to be on ground
they're doing some work and just finding
my feet there I'm not moving full time
don't worry I absolutely love living in
Sydney right now I'm just so happy with
my living situation I love my apartment
I love where I live and I just I love
life in Sydney I've never been happier
living some way I just feel so at home
here I'm still living alone in my
apartment but I always have friends
coming to stay it's pretty much why I go
to the spare bedroom we call my
apartment the halfway house because I
always have friends saying but yeah so I
pretty much had all of these meetings in
New York and LA and in London and I went
to London and I saw Izzy my best friend
that moved over there
Valon you guys obviously so I went over
for Tommy Hilfiger which was just insane
and so cool and yeah so now I'm home and
I'm planning on being home for a bit
you're going to Coachella I'm not sure
yeah I definitely want to go back to
Europe for winter here at some point so
if you guys know any good hotspots for
summer in Europe tell me where your
favorite places are because I really
want to do that
it's somewhere that's been a dream of
mine to go and explore and travel around
and I mean
may as well do it while I'm young when I
do finally get my booty over to Europe I
really want to focus on obviously I'll
be filming stuff for you guys for fun
but I really want to focus on my writing
that could be a perfect place to get
inspired and to kind of have some time
to be with myself and my thoughts to
write I definitely find new cultures and
new places I haven't explored before
very inspiring so yeah I kind of think
what other life updates oh yeah the TV
commercial that I shot for Garnier is
now out I use Garnier micellar water so
if you live in Australia I'm sure you've
probably seen it on like ads for YouTube
or on TV it's super cool also another
pinch myself moment a major highlight of
the past few months was filming that and
being a part of that that's just a dream
like doing anything in that acting space
or commercial space or teeth-like
anything I don't know I just like if you
had told me that a few years ago I just
would have laughed and thought you were
joking before I get into questions
another update life uptown just I guess
how I'm feeling when my head's at I am
at this point right now well I'm truly
feeling so great for a while I was so
overwhelmed and really confused with my
job with everything that was going on
it's like there was so many different
avenues that I wanted to be doing and I
wanted to be achieving all these things
and I just felt like I was taking that a
step forward and then five steps back
all the time because I didn't know how
to actually take my ideas and put them
into fruition and like I think what's
amazing now is that with my new manager
test like it's so helpful to have
someone that I think she's great she
just like I'll come with an idea like
yeah come on let's do it and now my
American agents are literally the exact
same I'll have an idea and they're like
Katya start working on it now so I feel
really good in terms of my work life I
feel like more of myself and I'm finally
starting to show
and be able to put into practice the
things that I'm actually genuinely very
passionate about I mean I love YouTube
but I always feel like there's so much
more I have to offer than just you know
making videos for you guys I have more
of a voice and I want to be able to
showcase that and do more with it um
creative wise there's so many things I
love to create that I don't really know
how to translate yet but I'm working on
that feel like I've got a really good
team around me I feel really supported
um which is amazing and I just feel like
I'm more understood now I think it was
always hard for me because I was such a
lone wolf you know I wasn't like every
other youtuber and I'm still not which
is it can be hard because I want to do
so many different things but I think
I've come to also accept the fact that
I'm not like everyone else on this
platform and that it's okay for me to be
doing my random weird stuff and somehow
still like I guess people are liking
that and for a while I was really scared
that I had to follow a certain thing and
I kind of dig off track with that which
I spoke about in a video a while ago but
no I'm feeling really grounded in my
wife stuff in my life feldheim home from
my trip overseas I really when I got
home had this moment to myself of just
being like what do you want to do
because you can do anything like stop
limiting yourself stop following what
other people want you to do or who they
want you to be just get back to you so I
haven't felt this myself in so long
trusting my heart more being more
accountable I think I've grown up quite
a bit and I'm like proud of myself for
that so yeah I'm just I'm just so
insanely excited for the year to come
I'm like also nervous by because it's
just been crazy so far like I've been to
I think I've been to five six or so I
can't remember how many countries it is
and it's only March
I'm like I feel good I filmed but I feel
like I know what stuff in my life I need
to get sorted and clean up and I am
still everyday just reminding myself to
be grounded to meditate to exercise to
do these things that keep my my mind and
my body and my spirit all on track and
level with each other because don't
think that I'm a very happy positive
person but being happy and positive and
keeping a good mindset and a clear mind
and positive mental health requires your
work every single day so I know if I
stop looking after myself and enough
self-love and kind works to myself if I
stop being myself up if I start getting
stressed if I stop comparing myself if I
saw getting all stuck in my head then it
becomes dangerous because that's when I
know I'm gonna just fall off track so
I'm every day reminding myself to be
kind to myself to say nice things to
myself to nourish myself etc etc you get
one saying it's important let's answer
some questions if someone told you five
years ago that you'll be shooting for
Tommy Hilfiger Milan what would you have
thought or said crazy crazy proud of you
and you so much it's insane it's only
really hit me now that I'm home and
surprised it's been like a week to
process everything that happen and like
I've also really done a lot of
reflecting on where I've come from and
yes really reflecting on the amount of
 that I got from people and the
bullying and like the harsh words every
when I was a girl I always say like to
whenever I when people are mean to
my back you're gonna regret this like
I'm gonna do great things and you're
gonna feel so silly for being so rude or
doubting me so they know something in me
when I was younger they always knew I'd
be doing stuff like that but I don't
think I fully would have believed that
I'd be doing stuff with Tommy Hilfiger
and shooting for them let alone being
sent over there to Milan to watch a
fashion show that it's just crazy and so
humbling to know that a big brand like
that of people in that sphere
can see me as value and can appreciate
my my voice or just my presence in that
world so it's very humbling and crazy it
still doesn't feel real I don't think
stuff like that ever will feel real
would you ever write a book talking
about spirituality and how you stay
positive and mindful honestly would love
if you did look how excited I just got
as I said I am really trying to focus on
my writing so watch this space we don't
we don't think too much for like maybe I
will write a book soon who knows how do
you keep motivated to stay as healthy as
you do get asked this a lot I stay
motivated to stay healthy because my
lifestyle is extreme it is very
exhausting it is very full-on I need to
stay healthy as balance to everything
otherwise I would just burn out so I
need to do things that are going to make
me feel good every single day that are
gonna make me feel energized so eating
healthy is one exercising is one
meditating and looking after my mental
health
journaling it's taking me time to
obviously find my my process with saying
healthy and motivated to stay healthy
but I think my life is so fast-paced
it's just something that comes with it
you need to if I want to keep up this is
what I need to do and also I've come
from a place when I was younger being
really overweight and not being so
healthy so when I lost a lot of weight I
changed my whole lifestyle so this is my
life so now and
it's more normal for me I've made this
my norm if that makes sense
any learn to be happy with yourself and
just self-confidence in general I'm so
sick of feeling down about myself all
the time I've answered a question like
this in a previous video and I just
summarized this about self confidence
self love being happy why should I be
happy myself watch it how do I stop
beating myself up and simply when I used
to do this all the time I still struggle
with this this is something we all go
through every day it is anything I have
to remind myself but firstly how
grateful I am to be in this life in this
body and I can't change this this is
what I have been placed with so you need
to make the most of it so I guess when I
was younger when I had this realization
like I was limiting my life so much I
wouldn't go out I wouldn't socialize I
locked myself away I was in such a bad
cycle of self-hatred I remember waking
up one day and just thinking you're
ruining and wasting your own life just
because of the thoughts that you think
other people are thinking about you and
they're probably not even thinking that
and even if they are proving them wrong
prove yourself wrong and and go and
challenge yourself and go and get
inspired and push yourself out of your
comfort zone because simply you are so
lucky to be healthy to be a lifetime a
roof over your head so many people would
kill for that and you're limiting your
life living in your head just because of
your fear irrational fears so the minute
I could get out of my head and just and
say it and and live my life for
myself instead of living it for the
people that were judging me or giving me
a hard time I just I don't know I just
grew from that point and every day I'd
still have doubts and every day
sometimes I look in the mirror and I'm
like
like I'm not happy about that or and I
have to catch yourself when you start
having those thoughts because it's not
healthy and it's social conditioning
that has made you feel that way like you
are not what other people think you are
so much more than that and you have to
connect you have to connect with
yourself you know the funniest thing
about connecting with yourself like it
can even go to the point where like
sometimes if I feel distant from myself
this is so funny but it might help you
practice it's what helped me if I felt
lonely um if I fell down on myself if I
hit if I felt anxious what I would do is
I was like lay down relax breathe and I
would hold my own hand like it's so it
I'll just be laying down I hold my own
hand if you can just for a minute look
at it and connect with yourself grab
your hand and look at him be like I have
myself and like you are your own best
companion so that's like a weird thing
but it always made me feel and does make
me feel quite confident it's about
connecting with yourself like you are
more than just your body but it's cool
to like touch in and be like hey this is
you this is me this is us look we're
going through this together like you you
as a person and your body like two
people two things you have to find a
yin-yang balance between the two and
find love in that space but also life is
short like don't live your life and feel
like life is so good when you
get out of your head and you start
living from your heart and from your
passions if you don't know what your
passions are yet live from your heart it
will tell you exactly where to go any
rituals or little things you do to stay
mindful and grounded my best thing that
I do is journaling gratitude lists
meditating yoga exercise Beach talking I
feel connected again I like to speak to
a close friend to my mom I'll know me
just like stop rambling about things
going on in my life and how I feel about
certain things it's taken me years to be
confident and comfortable to express
myself and how I feel even if that
involves crying or breaking down or just
letting someone in but as I've gotten
older and I realized the need how much I
actually need to
that it's become a lot easier for me to
communicate with people and open up to
people which I'm so grateful for because
they used to get to a point of me having
complete breakdown to be able to talk
about stuff sometimes it still is like
that I'll have time to it's really hard
for me to communicate and speak but as
I've gotten older lately it's become
easier and it always helps me feel on
track because I can just block out my
life and block out my issues and what I
need to get sorted I'm like okay I feel
more clear now so yeah that's really
good do you have a vision for your
future in terms of your job home family
and voice totally I have such a clear
vision for I guess the person I want to
become as I get older the life I want to
have so I open for anything pretty much
but and I know that I can't even predict
my life but I can predict kind of the
person I want to grow into and become a
knight I mean I am that person but as I
get older I want to kind of develop my
voice more I want to be doing things
that make people feel something that
help people feel not so alone I want to
do something that connects people that
are like-minded I'd love to do things in
the music space I'd love to do things
obviously acting and be able to express
myself through that playing a different
character playing a role putting my
energy into something that is way bigger
than me something that will live on for
you know years and for my home I haven't
you know the one thing I can never
predict is like where I'm gonna get
married and have a family like I don't
know where in the world I would be or
where I would even want to be but I just
want to be doing something always that
is bigger than I am and there is for
other people not just for myself I
already live such an indulgent life like
my career is amazing I get so many
things there are just insane I'm so
grateful for so I think that the basis
of everything I do always has to come
back to either helping someone directly
a group of people or something that
it's just a bit more substantial than
just for the sake of benefiting me like
I can benefit myself in my own time and
like do things that are indulgent and
like I'm such an indulgent person like I
spoil myself and I get spoiled which I'm
so lucky for so if I have a voice I can
do something with more substance that
might make other people feel good then
that's kind of my future plan for
everything it should have that vibe to
it how have you found motivation to keep
pushing through your weight loss journey
it's extreme it's hard like losing
weight is hard the whole it
isn't journey I've been on my journey
for five years now I like weight loss
there is no quick fix to losing weight
it is a lifestyle change and lifestyle
changes take time and persistence and
effort I'm still going through mine like
Finn through moments where I wanted to
give up so many times and I'm gonna make
a separate weight loss video I promise I
had so much to talk about on that topic
you've got to be doing it for yourself
it's the main thing you've got to want
to be healthy not be a certain body type
just have to want to feel good get real
with why you want to lose the way and
and and make sure you're doing it for
you and just to live a healthy life and
to feel good and be good and that's why
I stayed motivated because it felt good
to stay healthy and that was a part of
it being healthy and motivated and
losing weight it all kind of came ahead
and had mom I go on my camera's flash
and then it's about to die thank you
