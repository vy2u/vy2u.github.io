good friend Emma so okay emma is from
the stage you guys may know her from the
blog the messing it so that's her blog
that she runs and this come over to
Australia with me we're buying right now
and you guys obviously know boss snaps
and like my last time see episode now we
finally sat down to film a video that we
both find is pretty important to
overview the thing that we're trying to
get at is how to find yourself and then
feel comfortable enough with that self -
yes it looks latest a conversation
between us and talking with you guys
like other kids just here right now I
guess people would associate us as like
quite confident in ourselves like with
our jobs we're putting ourselves
completely out there we're going to do
being completely honest or media so
these are our tips how our journey
slowed and like how we've gone here and
I think this is the sort of stuff that
people should be talking about because
it's important yeah it's not spoken
about
it's like one plus is why we're doing it
justa yeah awesome so I think why this
needs to be talked about why it's not a
common thing is because people are so
afraid that when they suppose there's
yourself that they're going to get
judged I'm like that's literally how
you're right so if you stand out of the
crowd then you're an outsider and no one
wants to be a part of that because
everyone's just trying to fit in so that
they don't get the finger pointed yeah
but no one wants I why would anyone want
that and at first honestly we need to
start being yourself and a crowd of
people that aren't like look like you
you're going to feel alone but then you
expressing yourself and being that
person you truly are other people who
are like your and gravitated towards you
and the thing is that people always kind
of ask and like people want to know how
do you meet the friends of your friends
now I have you meet last minded people
and how to do this it's like you have to
be able to open the expression so first
and be comfortable with you before you
can meet these great people that I'm
going to cover to your life like the
universe works in weird ways they will
send the people into life when they need
to come but you need to have you first
before you can be creating these amazing
print together before even have real
relationships you really have to have a
relationship with yourself how do you
find yourself once you've gotten past
the barrier of okay I'm ready to be
meeting finally how do you find out
without it's because you spent so much
of your life influenced by trends or ask
the lever like suppressing
surprised I think that inner voice
society as always that you always know
what you wanted to do and then other
people around your telling you to do
something else yeah I've always known
that I wanted to write and you've always
envied wanted to like act or be you know
Carrie
yeah creating and then I thought when I
went to uni I was like oh I should do
psychology because that's a good degree
you know and it's just other people's
perceptions and if you take those on and
think that that's where you should be to
be better their eyes what it comes down
to I know how Madison a lot of my videos
with social informative the people
ruling over Society governments and
stuff and parents and generations passed
there's these rules put in place to keep
humans in a cage trapped environment so
nothing bad happened and the thing is
like it's totally fine from mass
populations but for individual growth
and stuff it's not doesn't apply to
everyone
one person's recipe for life does not
apply to everyone and the trap is when
you get caught in that recipe you need
to understand that you're an individual
like yes your parents daughter or your
parents son but they are not you and
you're not then you're all individuals
and you have to find your own path and
go don't know and don't think that if
you're doing something different that
you're feeling and even like in the
point that you said
hi said it's the man like on the street
laughter the tattoo is from the wild
outfit and like his standing out and is
showing his inner self on his
everything's out of somebody's like feel
us to do it and he gets attention from
that but most of the time people like
wow like oh my god the inside they're
probably thinking I wish I could do
that I wish I could be brave enough to
express yeah same with another thing in
discovering herself is pushing yourself
outside of those boundaries and get
uncomfortable because I feel I loop the
motorway holds me at the worst freaking
time you to claim she's gonna call again
she's gonna call get ready like everyone
the one thing as humans that we are
conditioned to is finding our confidence
what's really creatures of comfort every
we will always do the easiest option
because while importantly like it's
logical but when it comes to actually
wanting to experience your things and
learning and like really growing and
making a change you have to make
yourself uncomfortable and you have to
do things that you just you have to
experience new things there's no getting
out of your boxes and you realize I mean
some of the stuff that you're going to
try to do that makes you uncomfortable
are not going to be you and I'm not
mature to you but in finding out that's
not true you'll find out what it yes
exactly through the effects - it's on my
content on YouTube and what like my
comments in show so this is a good
example about pushing yourself and how I
try and very so slightly incorporate it
so as you guys would have seen I
recently started channel C and through
this video
but then my austerity or vlog then I Oh
stereotypical drinking anything they're
a bunch of it's like it started so I'm
it's a bit of a blob like follow Matt
and then the rest were just because ran
and crap and talking about like the
feedback I've been getting and a lot of
it's been like really really positive
Wow this makes me feel empowered and
makes my to travel makes my to
experience you think and in some of it's
like what is with these branded t-shirts
what is with this icon I don't
understand just so confused and I'm like
when I get those messages from people
that are either angry or they like like
mad about these videos and subscribe I'm
unsubscribing because these shots are
making my head hurt and also I love that
because the thing is I'm not creating
these videos to make everyone happy I
can easily find the essence of
positivity through my videos but the
fact of why I make them so strange and
why they're so me is that in life we're
not challenging up I want what people
watch my videos or what you know when
people write like and it went it with
anything you need to be pushing be felt
I can't get my that's it's something
different and people are just to see
another like whoa I don't want to see
that because I'm gonna have to make me
it makes you every way
and the thing is we are conditioned to
not want to think so this is me saying
like push yourself to try and think more
and like with
videos I'm just using my content as an
example because that's what I can easily
explain but the thing is with my videos
it's like I make them and I say I don't
people to love this or freaking hate
this or be angered by this or being
emotional about this or happy from this
like you need to feel more of an emotion
than just all those the cool I like that
and then forget about it we go I don't
get it like great you don't get it like
figure it out try and push yourself
you're just trying to now push outside
those boundaries you know because
there's not one right way to do anything
you need to find your right way and then
you'll really find your true self and
not following that recipe yeah so we
should poke about as well with the
videos it's like on YouTube and on with
magazines and with anything they don't
this will narrow base there's a formula
to it there's a recipe so example for
you to I can take home video make up
video favorites video get rid of me
chitchat what you know that that's the
recipe that's what you're supposed to
follow and then throw magazines like how
to talk to boys have different hair I'm
hearing oh my god it's embarrassing sex
story I like all this crap it's like let
me see challenging content out there
stuff that actually gets you thinking or
feeling something it seems scary or just
take little steps of being my today I'm
going to do one little thing that pushes
against a microcosm I don't majority
people watching this video right now
would be very creative people come to my
channel for a reason you've obviously
seen
so if you're sitting there kind of being
like oh my god like this project I want
to do or I'm going on they're talking
about this right now and you're probably
sitting there thinking about this tiny
thing that you're afraid you and so this
is anything from us take take a bit of a
big push just to say it and do it
because honestly like real really why
not I'm who cares with what
other people are going to say about it
because there's gonna be examples people
don't I see what you're saying and then
those are going to be the people that
you want your life in and we're going to
recognize you and that's how you build
communities relationships build up
yourself so now you covered go for it
yourself how you get there how you find
out who you are and now we want to talk
about ways in which once you've done
those two things when you're ready to go
yeah I don't know you can express
yourself oh it's mom oh my lord mom I'll
try to read you women coming it's like a
one at this point how do you begin to
express how to actually put this into
action and get out there I think the
number one thing that you can do is to
dress the way that you feel makeup comes
into it and clothing and jewelry how you
do your hair is what people are seeing
of you why would you want them to see
what you're feeling on the inside like
it like it seems like a superficial
thing resign yourself but it's really
not in because what they have control
over yeah I mean to an extent yeah but
you make it you need to make
you and like you need to be comfortable
in the commode and the way that you want
people to perceive because it's easy
enough to get up in the morning like put
on a white t-shirt and jeans and just
fit in but like I guess you feel
different in different days yeah I said
today that you're like I really want to
be me and Express this do it like I'm
wearing a purple dress it's a hat and
the necklace and this me like this is me
and this is an everyone style but like
this is me expressing what I feel that's
in high school I really long hair but I
always wanted to cut it like I think
since junior year I wanted to cut my
hair so badly and I waited and waited
because of things like and I didn't feel
too old yeah and then as soon as I
graduated I cut it all off which was
kind of like because I didn't want their
judgment on me and I wish that I had
done what I felt earlier working even
expressing yourself out it can be on
your social media outlets like I think
that's a really important thing too
because as much as we hate to admit it
the social media is a part of our lives
now like if this is how its progressed
social media is one with us so present
yourself how you want to present
yourself on social media its expression
on social media honestly for me as
helped me grow so much without my videos
without being able to like follow get
all that out there I don't know like
even when I was in a bad mood last night
I came home inside done re-watch one of
most times the episodes because I know
like that's how I can calm down and just
relax and like enjoy and live through
that and it's like that's my thing and
your thing's probably riding like when
you
you need to sit down rub it out they
kind of expressing yourself on social
media is captions like I think that your
captions are very personal and to what
you did that day and for me I'm a very
shy person like in big groups I freeze
up when I would never be able to talk to
a large group of people about what I'm
thinking but when I started doing it on
social media like I started talking
about things that I cared about veganism
about positivity and I could post it and
not feel like people were judging me and
you just doing that small thing like
sharing my thoughts out there is will
help me share that in person so you
don't freaks me out each day you're
never going to get each day or one day
every single day you live your a day
order in your day order like we live in
years but your every single day that day
is gone that day is gone you're
literally ripping your days off the
calendar until you reach slaughter and
if you could really count the days you
had left what would you be doing what if
you had a calendar and it was like I've
got 15 Ursula you don't know that but
like in life right now you don't know
that imagine that was your thing and
you're wasting it being somebody then
you're not you're wasting like 40 of
these days and maybe on the 10 day
oh yeah enjoy that's a good way to put
that even freaked me out and look like
John don't go go
no that's not what I'm saying it's just
pushing us up a little bit more to find
you and find out means have we fully
found up selfie light at all by just
Bubber in the process like everyone
continues to grow and learn as you get
older you never stop learning you never
fully know yourself you never fully are
like yeah okay but you need to be
confident in the person you are today
and right now and maybe if you're not
fully there yet and just I think it's
just learning to be friends with the
person that you are because how many of
us are friends with our dad exactly you
need to be able to sit in a room by
itself and entertain yourself and have
your own mind and like things about
yourself like qualities that you like
about your friend I was talking to my
friend last night and we were just like
to each other hands over there I'm so
happy I mean it was like I'm so happy I
mean - the thing is everyone needs to
really at that point because I've said
it in about five videos you're never
going to be anyone else so what are you
trying
it's humanly and physically impossible
in this lifetime in your lifetime that
you've been placing right now it's
impossible so you need to make it work
yeah and you need to enjoy it and you
should enjoy it because you have full
rights to freaking enjoy your life and
enjoy yourself no matter what situation
you're in that is that icon power love
it I feel a bit underpowered itself I
know we did
just like I remind you have to remind
yourself of this styles that it does
business so I just how people meeting
the very person
Oh buddy
for work mm as if like that it quits to
who they are yeah so that's what I asked
people when I meet them and say so what
do you do for work and then whether I
work in a office what do you really want
to do what's your passion and they're
like well actually really enjoy
photography and I'm like what what are
you doing to get there another oh I kind
of thought about this is like I did to a
boy at the festival our son and I just
saw his face light up a minute someone
actually wanted to know what the baby
said oh yeah his face just was beaming
and he and he was getting there with
this thing and I congratulated him on
that's awesome genuinely awesome
congratulations like keep pushing that's
a great question Lee what's your passion
that's something you should be asking
yourself like what's my passion not what
can make me money but am i passionate
about yeah what I love what we're trying
to do as content creators like cardamom
YouTube and me with like the blog and
like my new magazine is just to talk
about things that people don't talk
about and this is really one of them
that we want to start off with because
knowing yourself loving yourself
expressing yourself is key to growth
family first when we were like becoming
friends was when when I was getting
interviewed to this actual magazine that
she's done was I didn't know who's going
for the Sainz day and I thought when I
put her blog it was just going to be
and I finished up a standard like
interview and then when the questions
came out it was like this is what really
got my attention it was like she was
asking and stuff about like what
inspires you how often do you fall in
love like like what is the most
important things in your life that she
described as one of my videos that she
loved and was like so what was like what
went into that what actually like
passing things about what's why am i
growing and that's what I love about MS
content is that it's like digging deeper
into someone and about expressing that
because through this I I've been I
would've then show or like expressed
more about me but this is a good example
that I wanted to share is like and this
honestly Memorex I didn't know the level
of like what this name thing would be
even reading through it myself like
there is positive affirmations
throughout this whole thing and there's
playlist of music there's like it's real
person stuff not ad there's no ads in
this like there's no no my own my doing
my expression through my videos and
stuff but I think it's awesome also to
support other people doing it and so I
just want to put it out there that ends
what her magazine cover messages and I
genuinely don't think you guys should
check it out and you know that someone's
like heart and soul and passion has gone
into this and as many other people that
feature and this beautiful imagery
I can mentor for this because I honestly
was in shock I'm gonna shut up to be
alone look whatever I thought for that
one in there if you guys want to check
it out I do have my interview in it is
my hands-down favorite interview and
that shoot with gabby is my favorite you
guys love the workout man I do together
so if you want to see in shops properly
in this beautiful book with lovely
writing by and check it out the link
will be in my bio I think I really like
actually look like oh my god I'm
actually so proud of you
I saw her news actually
thank you for joining in here honestly
I'm like so in love with them right now
I'm so in love right now I could cry
like surprised how to say you guys Rock
and thank you for continuously on this
board
I honestly give brings me hope for the
younger generation of how much of love
they can spread to an individual or
individuals and it's we're going to go
so it's oh my god
