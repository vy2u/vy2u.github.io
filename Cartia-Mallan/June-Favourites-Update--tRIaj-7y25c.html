showing you my goal of what month is it
June June favorites our vision yes it's
June oh my gosh Thea is actually been
flying past so quickly it's my birthday
next month and I'm like whoa what the
hell splendas in like five weeks four
weeks I'm not sure but it's really soon
everything is quickly quickly
approaching and I just say that it's
kind of scary Oh what the hell today I
thought I'd sit down and show you guys
some of my June favorites because I know
you guys really like seen the favorites
videos and I have some really really
cool stuff that I want to show you guys
so I'm gonna stop blabbering on and
let's just jump straight into the
products the video the video so my first
favorite for the month of June is this
really beautiful wooden watch from jawed
I am actually obsessed with this watch
I've been wearing it so much lately it's
really like wooden material watch
got like the dark brown colors on the
outside with like dark brown and hints
of like black brown and in the middle is
just like a really nice light brown
color and just silver detailing on the
Tiki thingy and then at the back it's
just got you just pinching the sides and
it opens like that
this watch is so just light and
comfortable and I absolutely love with
like the wooden look of it I think it's
really kind of edgy and cool and so
different like not many people wear
wooden watches like everyone's got the
other Michael Kors silver watches and
all the bling-bling watches but if you
just wanted to tell me a bit more like
chilled out and calm I think this is the
perfect watch top four and I love the
earth you feel about it it's really easy
to stack with other pieces of jewelry
and it just goes really well this watch
is constructed out of zebra wood it's
really special and unique because it
does have those kind of like light
strokes of darkness and lightness in it
I've actually collaborated with jawed to
create a little giveaway for you guys so
you can have a chance of wearing the
watch so simple and easy there's a link

it's click the link and it'll take you

honestly why would you not want this
watch it's just so super cute so the
next products I want to be speaking
about is some jewelry and oh my you guys
might have seen this jewelry in my
nighttime routine I briefly kind of
shouted that for a minute but I want to
go into more depth with it this month
I've been absolutely obsessed with some
of my jewelry from Dixie I've been
wearing these three necklaces from Dixie
stole all a month like literally every
day that I get a chance I'm surprised
like I wanted to wear with this outfit
but I was like not gonna show them I've
been obsessed with layering these three
necklaces and I'll just start with this
one
it's this super cute it's like a little
crystal necklace and it has two lunar
moons on either side and it is just so
so pretty and really delicate like I
love kind of just like simple like
mixing up wearing like I used to I like
lots of big chunky so necklaces and I'm
kind of mixing out with some just like
live detailed silver ones so this is so
so pretty I put this one with this other
one it's just like hold up I'm getting
like actually also go to open all these
necklaces and then there's this really
cool kind of like a circle kind of
circular thing with like little
detailing on the side and I love this
one it's so cool and then the third and
final one that I also layer with that
it's just this it's just kind of looks
like that and it's just so pretty I'm
obsessed I wanted to buy the whole
entire store and I was on the website
but I was like no cardio it resists and
next I'll move on to I'm like all my
stuff's over here so I'm like that's
mine keep looking you got it
my next favorite for this month is this
super cool hat from a fallen broken
Street you guys would have seen me
wearing this and so many of my photos I
bought it when I was down in
the Newcastle foregrip in the mood and I
went from the last or and one of this
hat for so like I saw it on so many
models and I was like it's so super
different and I didn't know if I'd soon
enough but then I was like like screw it
I'm just gonna get it it is actually the
coolest however obviously it looks a bit
stupid with my hair pulled up now but
you get the point of kind of what it
looks like it just sits really
comfortably on your head and I think you
just adds a bit of edge to your outfit
my next favorite for this month is
something that I picked up a few weeks
ago or like the other week when I was in
Byron from spell is this super amazing
crochet bag this is really old season
from spell it's from like last year
sometime it's been in stock for ages but
I've actually been in love with it since
last year and it's pretty pricey it's
like almost $200 for the bag and I was
like I've been every time I went into
spell I was like oh I love this bag like
I just want to get it and then I never
get in it because I already had so many
bags and then I just went in I was like
you know what I'm gonna buy the bag car
yeah I'm gonna do it you know treat
yourself just get it
I'm tied in I know I have it and I'm in
love and I literally carry with
everything it's just so soft and like it
fits so much stuff in it and it doesn't
actually come fighted like that but I
got a little annoyed with all the
tassels on the this things they kept
getting caught so I just plotted mine
it's my favorite part about it is that
it's just really low hung so the strap
and it's really big and it's also
adjustable so I just love being I would
like throw it over my shoulder and just
have like a slouchy back keeping on the
subjects of bags and all the bag that I
picked up a little while ago is this
really cool backpack from LaMotta just
pocket to the front it opens like this
and has a drawstring and like has
leopard print in the middle and just
adjustable straps on the back and a zip
I love the color of this bag it's like
white brownie color and anytime I'm kind
of been in barn or going around or
traveling the place it's kind of so much
easy just to put a lot of my stuff in a
backpack because I can just
tuck it on my bag and just stack it it's
so much easy to carry then like a big
kind of bulky bag so I I've absolutely
been loving this they sorry for the
lighting it keeps like what are you keep
doing is it like flicking every time I
like just me no that's not just me it's
just doing that
my next favorite are these really cool
around reflective Sony's you guys know
that I love like round sign style and I
thought these I'm super cute diffic you
super cool and edgy
it looks like funny oh it's a lot like
the ring matters like you of them I got
good about look at that Oh like little
bee eyes whoa oh my god oh my god that's
so weird I also got these from Alameda
when I ordered might be Aggie I'm really
bad this I don't know like how to end
off saying and I've like got a favorite
like you're my favorite now I'm gonna
read one - another favorite okay done
with that this has been one of my
favorites for more than just this month
I think I got it last month or sometime
around then this is my vlogging camera
you guys have asked so many times like
what companies to vlog them sup and it
is this little baby here this is the
canon g7x it's just the greatest thing
that i've invested in it's quite pricey
but definitely worth it the autofocus is
brilliant normally when you get these
little covers like this says no like
flip screen but in fact look at that
look at that it's like a tall mitre old
flip phone like you flip it off and be
there anyways that's my I'm sorry bad my
camera has actual sand and grass and
dirt all in it from camping and stuff
but um yeah so for me for vlogging it's
really great cuz I can just hold out
there I can still see my flip screen the
view camera to make sure I'm in focus
and to make sure that the lighting is
all good and stuff and I know it's just
a really great thing to have I guess um
I would say that it's a great camera
here youtuber and you want to do
vlogging probably the perfect camera for
that there's obviously other options
that this is my favorite so far
but if you're using it mainly for photos
it's
it's pretty it's good but it's not the
greatest for photos I view a more into
photography I'd probably wouldn't invest
in this camera but if you're into
filming I would definitely say go for
this camera feel a little incomplete
like I have eaten all my favorites but
they're pretty much all my favorites oh
actually no I will kill this a another
favorite I recently picked up this cool
gold a turtleneck shirt long-sleeved
tunic shirt I'm in love with it look how
funky it is I just so cool I love
turtlenecks and I found a gold one so
it's just like a win-win situation and I
just got this from a vintage store so I
hope you guys enjoyed oh look I'm in the
weirdest mood now
lucky I'm only I'm and they feel me now
because otherwise throughout the whole
video it would have been like anyways um
so there's all the favorites before I go
I just want to quickly ask you guys um
so I obviously know lately I haven't
been posting as frequently I apologize a
lot for that I've been in exams I'm just
crazy crazy crazy busy and as much as I
want to put up videos for you guys if
I'm kind of in like a cranky mood and
stuff I don't want to film because I
don't want it to be like me giving off
really bad energy to you I want it to be
when I'm happy and I'm like excited to
film and stuff and one thing I did want
to just kind of speech you guys about
like one-on-one chat if you're hopefully
is still at the end of this video that'd
be cool because you may have noticed if
you watch a lot of my videos that when I
do vlogs lately I've been making them a
bit more wacky and really different cut
so you guys like whoa what the hell is
this like what's going on um but I just
kind of want I don't know how to explain
it's kind of hard like I don't know what
to say is I hate as much as I love I
love making normal YouTube videos and
stuff I have quite a big passion for
making films and making like they're not
films that I guess well I love making
films so a way for me to kind of put my
passion into doing each of us as well
it's kind of like collaborating them and
combining them together so um you will
probably be seeing a lot more kind of
abstracting vlog type video films on my
channel I know some of you like don't
like this style of vlogging but it's
definitely much more me and I hope you
guys do get on board and enjoy it
because I love love
making those videos it's so much more
roar than me just like talking to a
camera like oh I'm going here now and
now I'm doing this knowing that you can
actually see what I'm doing like when I
film those videos I'm filming it like
well that's gonna film this like just
how it is or one of my friends is
filming or something and it's so much
more raw and it's unique and it's very
much for me you can definitely learn a
lot more about me from those videos if
you kind of like delve into it and just
enjoy it even though it's something
really different but yeah that's just I
guess um yeah I'm quiet I have a
different style to other youtubers so I
know it's like it might take a little
bit of time to getting used to but I do
just want to warn some of the stuff that
I film is different themes that may
offend or you may not be happy with and
partying doing all of that stuff I just
want to say before you if you just to
warn you if you're not into that sort of
thing you don't want to see that don't
watch it don't comment on it if you do
want to see that though cool get on
board and it's I'm a normal teenager
just like you guys and you'll probably
see that in the videos I do everything
that you guys probably do and um it's
it's just me and I'm filming me and I
want to make these videos and it's just
I don't know I don't know what to say I
guess I kind of come from a background I
go to a school with lots of filmmakers
and different creative people so the way
my mind takes is quite different it's
quite quirky it's kind of strange I am a
little bit weird with my ideas but as I
said that's just me and I'm going to be
making a lot more of those videos maybe
I'll ask like why are you making them
like this now and it's definitely to try
and just well one I love them that's
it's how I feel I want to convey a movie
I want to convey something and I think
they're much more influential than just
me talking and a camera you can like yes
I just want to show you guys that you
can get out there and live and have fun
and do crazy stuff and be responsible at
the same time and be a kid and be a
teenager and just showing you I guess a
little snippet of my life and you know
anyway I don't know if any of this is
made sense I'm really nervous it's a
very scary subject for me because um it
was freaking for me to put out my first
video like that see you but Bryan's I
kind of consider them like little baby
films like just putting little baby
films out there like every now and then
random little films but yeah I just hope
you guys take it on board and this is me
this is what I like to do and um yeah
I'm just kind of at the moment going
through a stage I'm tailoring my channel
to make it what I want to be and what I
want you guys know about me and I'm
comfortable enough to show you guys this
part of me and um I think I've got such
a great family of you guys I wouldn't be
able to do it if I didn't have the
support so thank you for supporting the
ones I've already done there will be
many more but I am comfortable enough
with you guys to actually take you along
with me like this and show you the stuff
that is normally socially such shunned
upon and I know I do have younger
viewers and I'm not definitely trying to
shove anything down their throat or show
a bad image but I don't want to have to
be stuck under a blanket where it's like
oh you're a youtuber you have to make
sure you're clean and pristine and
perfect and fake and act for you guys
like that's not real like I want to show
you real so yeah that's what I got to
say about that that was so lame I'm so
embarrassed about that what was this oh
my god let's let that one go that's all
I have to say in this video thank you
thank you so much for watching and leave
me any comments below for future video
requests leave me some of your favorites
from this month and I'm gonna go check
out some of the things you comment link
anything clothes or beauty products
anything you think I should check out
and that's all I have to say so um yeah
cool thanks for watching and I'll see
you guys why don't my doing this why is
this hand flying into outer space chill
out please I'll see you guys in my next
video
