going to be taking this gold Paint Pot
from Mac and priming my eyelids with it
then I'm taking this l'oreal eyes shadow
palette and taking the lightest color
first and applying it all over my lid
then with the next color which is this
gold color i'm going to be blending this
all over my lid and up into my crease
the next caller I'm taking is this
medium brown color and I'm putting this
on my outer crease with a pencil brush
don't bother being too neat with this
because we can blend it all out
afterwards which is what I'm going to do
and this will just make sure there's no
harsh lines and that all of the colors
blend together next I'm clearing
clearing cleaning up my brow bone so I
can apply some highlighter there and
just wiping all of the excess shadows
that are fallen and once again blending
out that line so that the line isn't too
harsh
taking a brown eye shadow from my Naked
2 palette I'm going to be applying this
to my lash line with a pencil eye shadow
brush then with my benefit high brow I'm
taking this stick and applying it to my
brow bone to give a nice definition
my brows now I'm just blending it out
with my brush but you can also just use
your finger to Pat in the product it's
up to you yeah
so hard to do a really thin line play
string such a big one yeah are you using
myself yep
okay so classic me I couldn't not do
Leila's laughing so I did like massive
eyeliner I have a problem I can't do
small eyeliner so we've just kind of
added my own little touch on this doing
like bigger thicker eyeliner but it
still works honestly I think that you
can do whatever sort of Island a look at
is that you like because the main part
is the eyelashes though just say like
patent now I'm just putting a stack of
mascara on my eyelashes like a stack
like a lot because I'm putting on a
massive false lashes after this
and don't forget to put a lot and a lot
and a lot of mascara on your bottom
lashes because her bottom lashes are
literally massive you can either put
like false lashes like quite a month but
I don't have any so I'm just going to
put a little
now that I've put on the astara I'm
going to be pushing my Napoleon
eyelashes which looks like give me a
minute yeah
really massive how would you describe it
flicky like they that spa kind of really
out there which she always has really
big separate kind of lashes so I thought
those ones would be perfect so I'm going
to go ahead and apply them I do have a
video on that so leave it down below if
you don't know how to apply false lashes
then you can go watch the video and then
you know how to do it and some time I'm
just wiping off all the excess makeup
from underneath my face from where all
the eyeshadows kind of full and humble
just putting on my still out one-step
crackle of my face to prime it because
we are putting on quite a lot of
foundation
now I'm taking my makeup forever HD
foundation on my Sigma flat kabuki brush
I'm just putting this layer of
foundation on as a base before we start
contouring and highlighting of our
facial features because this will help
all the other products go on a lot
easier I have a full video on how Kim
contours and highlights I'm really
quickly going to skim through this if
you want a more in-depth tutorial on how
to do this I'll leave the contouring and
highlighting they are in the description
box now I'm taking my darker foundations
and contrary
which is yeah yeah
so now that we've done that that will
pretty much give us an outline for where
we put most of the powder just before I
do the powder I'm going to fill in my
eyebrows
okay now that my eyebrows are done I'm
going to go and set my under eye
concealer with some translucent powder
now I'm taking my nas Cocina bronzer
which is a really really dark brown
bronzer and my is actually my Real
Techniques setting brush and it's just a
really small brush but I'm gonna go in
to use it to carve out my cheekbones so
just taking the brush and right on the
cheekbone you want to draw a straight
line through
I also like to do is just take the
bronzer again and run it just me my chin
heel because it will slim down my face
in the mall because she has a really
slim defined face then taking my normal
bronzing brush I'm going to now fully
blend out the cheek and bronze it up a
little bit then if you want to go an
extra step further you can put another
straight line down with that bronzer and
this time don't blend it out this will
give you the effect of really dominant
cheekbones now I'm going to be
contouring my nose because Kim does have
a really thin nose compared to mine she
always kanto contours her nose in any
makeup look that she does just once
again to just make it appear a lot more
thin taking that same bronzer with just
a small like my little eyebrow pencil
and during small little lines down at my
nose
now once you have really funny brown
line so you know you want to take a
little blendy and and blend it all out
the intima always wears quite a lot of
blush we like a lot of bronzer and stuff
so in the photo shed I really like pink
toned blush on so I'm taking max blush
in the color dainty which is a really
cute rose pink color
don't be afraid to put a little bit more
than you usually would because Kim Boise
has quite a lot of flashlights then I'm
just taking a little bit of max soft and
gentle to highlight my cheekbones also
is going to add a tiny little dot on my
nose to bring out that contour higher
there and also just a little bit on the
top of my lip now I'm taking a
translucent powder to set all of the
makeup together and to reduce any shine
I'm just lining my lips with a nude lip
liner most makeup looks that Kim does
have she has like a really nice pink
nude lip so to achieve that I'm going to
be taking two lipsticks from Mac one is
cream cup and one the other one is creme
de nude and the cream cup just is
slightly more rose pink and then the
creme de nude is more nude now over the
top to give it more of a nude effect I'm
taking a creme de nude and just applying
this over the top as a finished look up
completely I'm taking this as a nude lip
gloss I think it's just a Revlon one but
it looks exactly like the I think it's
the nos lip gloss in Turkish Delight
that she uses I'm not sure I think
that's what it is but it looks just like
the color that she uses so to give a
really nice glossy and plump look I'm
just applying this over the top of the
lipsticks
so this is the final makeup look going
to go now and cut my hair somehow trying
to make it look like Kim's and I'll be
back with the finished product so this
is my hair all curled up like Kim's I
tried to sort of do it how she does it
but my hair doesn't have nearly as much
volume as hers does but anyways this is
the complete makeup in hair so if you
