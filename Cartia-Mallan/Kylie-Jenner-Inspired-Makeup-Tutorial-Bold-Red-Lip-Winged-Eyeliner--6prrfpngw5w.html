Kylie Jenner inspired makeup look so
it's just this bright red lip and winged
out cat eyeliner if you'd like to find
out how to get this just keep watching
okay so start out I will be using my
dark circle eraser now I'm putting this
underneath my eyes and on my nose and
chin and forehead because this is where
the Sun would naturally hit now doing
this to give a bit of a highlight
because in the photo Kylie is quite
light under those sections also before
this I have also put on my usual
foundation step now I'll just be
blending it out with my Sigma tapered
blending brush and you just want to tap
this in so that you don't I don't know
blend it in too much with your
foundation because you do want it to be
quite visible to give a nice highlight
okay so next I'll be filling in my
eyebrows and for this I'm using my
eyebrow pencil okay so the left eyebrow
I've already filled in as you can see
I've slightly arched it up a little bit
just because in the photo Kylie does
have quite high arched eyebrows and they
are locked into the month so I keep that
in mind it's hard to do these things
next I'll be using the Too Faced shadow
bon bons palette so it comes with this
eyeshadow primer which has a kind of
sparkly gold tone in it I'll just be
applying with me with my finger over the
lid completely now this will just give a
little natural shimmer to the look
altogether while helping the eyeshadow
to stay in play
okay so then I'll be taking my Mac two
to four brush which is like an eyeshadow
blending brush and applying this kind of
tan skin tone color just onto the lid to
create I don't know it like a natural
kind of look because Kylie doesn't
really have much eyeshadow in the photo
then I'll be taking my Bihar Bahama Mama
bronzer which is kind of just like a
dark brown so you can use any sort of
eye shadow you've got as well and I'll
be applying it to the outer corner sort
of in the crease just to give a little
bit more definition to the look it's
hard to do this
I get sore
then taking my favorite highlight of the
mary-lou manizer which is this really
nice kind of sparkly cream pale color
I'm going to be highlighting my brow
bone so just up in the eyebrow because
since Kylie's brows are quite arched and
mine are a little thicker I'm going to
do this just to create that animal
arched effect now taking my Rimmel arm
liquid liner I'm going to be lining my
eye in a winged out kind of look so you
want to bring your line you want to stop
doing your line I'm kind of halfway to
the eye and then winged it out now I did
kind of ruin the eye a little bit so I
had to go back and do it again so just
pre-warning it can get a little bit
tedious doing it but just keep going
back or removing any lines that I'm a
bit too thick because her eyeliner is
quite minimal but really nicely done and
really winged out
love the pain then taking my natio
crayon liner I'm going to be lining just
the inner waterline on the top lid just
under not really on top they're just
kind of underneath in the in that little
socket area cubes under then just take a
white eyeliner doesn't really matter
what type just any and I'll be applying
that to your bottom waterline to really
open up the eyes and make it look even
more natural
now just under the lash line I'm going
to be playing a brown eyeliner just
because Kylie's um lash line is quite
dark where she puts in a scar so this
will just help emphasize the lashes even
more again I see you rolling it over
yeah okay so finally for the eyelashes
as we all know the Kardashians and
Jenna's are quite famous for their
really long luscious eyelashes so in the
photo Kylie does have quite elongated
and really separated natural lashes so
I'm just going to be playing a little
bit of iron mascara and then putting
these natural crisps simple kit level
one drama eyelashes on this is what it
looks like with the lashes it's very
simple and natural and I'm just blending
it all together with some more mascara
again okay so just to highlight the
inner corners of the eyes I am using a
light shimmery eyeshadow crayon then
with this a little concealer brush I'm
going to blend this out okay so now we
finished the eyes I know it may seem
like a lot of steps but honestly it is
so simple and easy to do so now we'll
move on to the face okay so this step is
optional but what I like to do after
this is just take the highlight that we
used in the first step again and apply
it back under the eyes on the nose
forehead and chin just to really
emphasize um I know that lightness under
the eyes
you should be negative
start over like me
knocking now I'll be using my own
appalling face powder to just set
everything and all the foundation and
highlighters in place just close
next we're just going to warm up the
face a little bit by using the matte
bronzer now I'm just applying it not
really in my cheekbone area just kind of
on the cheeks just to give a little bit
of warm as she does have some color
there it wants them in the photo we can
see that Kylie does have really rosy
cheeks so I'm going to be using this
matte blush called early morning and
applying this right to the apples of my
cheek
then once again with the mary-lou
manizer highlighter I'm just taking this
on a brush and applying it to my nose
just above where I put my blush and also
under my chin and above the lip now
before I apply the bright red lipstick
I'm going to prep my lips with this lip
scrub now taking this bright red lip
liner I'm just going to carefully line
my lips now I did actually take a lot
longer to do this I've just sped it up
but make sure you are careful with hey
Joe because it is quite hard to get the
color off once you are mark outside of
your lip area defeat but I'm taking my
Rimmel London red lipstick I'm going to
apply this to the lips now this color is
quite a raw red color and you just want
to put that on the base and make sure
it's all on neatly within the lines then
over the top of this I'm going to be
applying my natio
lipstick which has more of a pink
undertone which will warm this look up
and to set this in place and to modify
it I'm taking my Revlon translucent
powder and just applying it with that
Mac blending brush
okay so this is the completed look now
if you do want to take it a little extra
step further you can take out your hair
and curl it up just like Kylie does have
in the photo and okay here's what it
looks like when it's all cold so thank
you everyone so much for watching

you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
