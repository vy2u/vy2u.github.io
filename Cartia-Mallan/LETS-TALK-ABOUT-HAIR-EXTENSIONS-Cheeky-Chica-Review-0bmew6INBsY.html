the title today I will be doing a review
on some hair extensions and I said start
the video this is my first ever review
I've never done a review on anything
before and you guys constantly ask me
questions about like my hair extensions
which ones I like the best what type of
hair extensions I use etc also I'm going
to explain a little bit about previous
hair extensions I can't speak to
extensions feels like the hardest thing
to say like extensions but that one sort
just I'll be answering a lot of
questions about that I'll be reviewing
um the cheeky chicken Eric's tensions
and yeah I'll just talk about extensions
in general and yeah first up as you can
tell I've had my tape hair extensions
taken out I got them taken out just so I
can start getting my hair to grow again
normally because when I have extensions
in permanently I just kind of forget
that my normal hair also needs tender
loving care too sometimes so I end up
killing it and styling it so much more
and all that heat damage is just not
good so I got them out and then perfect
timing these headaches and expire we go
again yeah these hair extensions arrived
in the mail in like perfect timing so
I've been testing them out over the
weekend I've styled them killed them
seen how they kind of work see how long
they stay and yeah so I'm going to tell
you what I think of them these are the
hair extensions they look like normal
hair extensions um mine are the I said
to read this mildly exquisite 24 inch
200 gram hair extensions so I'm going to
put this in really basic terms for
people that might not know I hope you
have information about hair extensions
like when I first started getting into
hair extensions I watched all these
videos and there'd be like all this
grams stuff and the weft and the clips
and the double wefted and whatever else
and I was like can you please speak
English what is even this stop so I'm
going to put in really really basic
terms make it really easy and
understandable because it is really easy
it's just people like to confuse it here
is your path of hair extensions there's
all different sizes of the weft so left
is like this thingy
and okay so mine as I said are the
24-inch um
exquisite hair extensions and this is in
shade number two cocoa brown these are a
tiny bit too like my hair color like
literally you can't tell that much but
they sort of blend in but they're a
little bit lighter so whatever you just
go with it
my last hair clip in hair extensions
were time it darker so you can put
you've got a bit of a leeway for either
one but yeah pretty much if you
accidentally kind of order a color
that's a little bit too light or a
little bit too job honestly it's fine
normally most of the time they'll blend
in and it'll look alright they're the
extensions that I've got and I'll show
you what the clips look like so this is
one of the 3-piece ones and pretty much
there's just three clips it's like a
normal thing it has the little clip
thing there what I like about these
clips is that they've got this as a
silicone strip just under the clip so
pretty much that helps because once you
like clamp it into your hair and you
push that down the silicone strip is
like makes it not come out because it's
got that stick to the hair and so if you
don't if you have ones without silicone
strips it just kind of they slip out of
the hair so easily I've had past
experiences and they just horrid is from
the first look they look sewn on really
well the weft is quite thick like I
can't actually see through it so that's
pretty good thickness so there is I
think there's two of the three piece
ones then there is two of the - clip one
so I like to put these up in either the
top of my hair here and then there is
one massive four piece one which I have
to put around like the largest part of
my head and then there's two little one
and clip-on four there in my bathroom
because I don't normally use it so they
come with all those clips um but it
really just depends on how thick you
want your hair to be if you want to put
all of them in or if you don't have if
you've got a pretty fine hair you don't
need that much or you've got really
thick I need all of them so it really
just depends I'd switched up all the
time so I got the hair extensions they
came in this bag so it's like a little
plastic sheet bag which is great that
actually came with it because you can
store it in here so it's protected and
they don't get ruined it says my style
and Colour so I guess if I ever need to
autumn or I know what I ordered in the
first place and then the hair extensions
themselves were clipped onto it so it
just is like the logo and they were just
clipped in there and then on the back
it's good because it has some
maintenance information so that's what
the packaging and the bag and stuff look
like umm okay so in regards to the hair
my review on them
um when I first got them over the bag
they were incredibly soft so nice as
motioning hair extensions are but these
ones were brilliant they finally
definitely was not let down by that from
wearing them so far and what I can tell
so far is I've really really liked them
first time I wore them they styled
really easily so I as you can tell my
Nicole and I always normally have them
curl to it held the curls really well
when I had sprayed them together it
blended with my hair so easily they did
not tangle one bit or get knotty at all
there's the one thing I actually was so
happy about sometimes with previous hair
extensions that I've had they not
happening up here on your head and like
all I pull and tug and hurt that's one
of the men don't talk they don't hurt at
all they just sit really comfortably but
these ones did not not did not not once
so it was really great and when you
brush them through they're all soft all
over again but pretty much a bit of
information like about the extensions
themselves if you're like new to
extensions and you want to try out some
there are a hundred percent premium remy
hair so that means that real human hair
obviously so you can style them dye them
cut them color them probably not
advisable to dye a darker hair extension
a lot of color it'll take out a lot of
its softness and it just will probably
not be too nice because it's obviously
not real hair it's not getting natural
oil from your head so um it's been
treated to feel soft and stuff but with
maintenance it's pretty much like all
common sense like brush them gently make
sure you double it make sure you
actually brush them so you don't just
let them like take them out and leave
them naughty and you're like make sure
they're all nice it's the same as your
real hair so use a heat protectant spray
do I want it to get damaged as I said
it'll dry it out even more and then just
becomes harder to style and they'll turn
out getting ready if you look after them
they will last for ages pretty much for
like washing them you only really need
to wash them every three to see
weeks or something depending like if you
want to watch them and stuff but you
just watch them like noir lukewarm water
and I'd say like try and I'll get the
clips wet just try and watch through the
hair I really really love clubbing hair
extensions to be honest like I think
they've improved so much since the first
ones I ever had about two years ago they
were horrible knotted so much I paid a
fortune for them and I took so long to
come these ones
came in the mail quick there they sit so
well in my hair they just look so nice
and natural so many different color
options that you can get in regards to
this company it was it so so happy with
their customer service the lady I was
emailing was so lovely if had any
questions about anything it would be on
to it reply to emails quickly was just
really really sweet and I think they've
got a really well established little
company going on it's just really good
I'm just on their website now so I'm
just having a look around pretty much
it's really really helpful there is a
frequently asked questions page this is
so helpful because they have a support
page where it kind of goes through like
a color match service so you can send
them a photo and they'll match up your
hair color to a color in the hair
extension line that they think will
match you so you don't order it order
some hair exams and get like the
completely different color there's like
a clip and guide so how to clip them in
and I also do have a video on how to
clip in hair extensions so I'll link it
below I don't think I've really had them
long enough to say anything bad about
them yet they've been really great for
me I've worn them out for the past two
nights when I've gone out to I was out
at a party last night they stated
perfectly came home and my hair was
still all nice and cold
umm did not move one bit sat really
really well and yeah but if you do want
to check out the cheeky cheeky hair
extensions I'm going to leave their link
below I'll leave um the link to the one
that I got myself just in case if you've
got like similar hair color and I'll
leave my little code below so you can
get a discount on the hair extensions
and yeah that's all I really got to say
about the hair extensions make this too
long like me babbling on about stuff I
want to just tell you the main points
and the overall i'd rate them pretty
high score in the rank of
hair extensions that I've had I've had
some shockers over the time that I've
been using hair extensions and these are
actually really great and I'm so happy
with them so far so I'm going to go and
clip them in and install my hair how I
want it and I'll come back and show you
what they look like the minute that my
hair extensions are all clipped in I
feel like I'm ready for the day like the
moment when you get your eyebrows waxed
like I've got my life together and I'm
feeling good okay so this is what the
hair looks like all clipped in it is so
so long but that's what I love about it
I said the whole time when I had them in
just stroking them because that's all so
I hope you all enjoyed this video and
you like to see like what my take on
these hair extensions were I find

a product especially especially

cons of that product you want to see
