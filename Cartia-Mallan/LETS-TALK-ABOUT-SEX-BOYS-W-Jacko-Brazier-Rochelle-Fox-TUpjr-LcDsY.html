one night said yes or no um I used to be
like yeah and I'm like big foam no
you're not leaving to that argument if
you weren't in a relationship one night
sense or not um no I'm a bit of like I'm
a love of love oh I'm gonna be like so
like infatuated into someone to do
that's and I can never tend to my
nightstand because obviously keen and
like has to keep going to continue the
rumble of know I'm the type of guy that
would marry the one I'm saying the next
day yeah you're a little sensitive boy
I'm certain you get so like Jaco goes in
on girls
when he likes younger going to evening
is just like you know I mean I think
jacket is like exquisite jumper some
more sensitive than you guys think they
actually think airs what I love a bad we
should have made it work I should have
been a good how do you know if the guys
only using you for sex if he called you
like later might text you later mine yes
like makes an effort during the diary
yeah if you don't want to be seen with
you during the day they're always
wondering okay I don't want anything but
we can hang out if you want you just
need to pick up on the sign things
dropping down you know I mean my name is
crystal go around the room feel really
it's really
kaalia place is so nice guys I wish you
could come and like have a long what's
the worst part about having a penis
tell you the lie you guys don't know
about hey it's great fun
how do you get a guy to notice you in
good life um I think he'd be a really
lovely person and you just do so neat
you're selling yourself I know the dress
Claudia I just like the slot to get his
attention cuz you should actor don't say
slot I think I'm dressed for you're
solid I think that you can like I don't
think being confident like I think guys
love confidence like I think it's very
message
the thing about a person like I think
from a guy's point of view because I'm
such I wouldn't Lok let like seeing a
girl if I see a girl in track with a guy
and when they confident you can see when
a guy's like well I think it's just a
daisy and just be like sure about
yourself like I think that's like guys
really love what a girl is like
confident and like just in a
conversation like don't just agree with
everything they say like I have anything
yet have an opinion in like yeah like
say what you want to say and like stand
true to your opinion because I find like
most conversations I have with a guy if
I like actually state my case they're
like oh cool I think men also really
like to be challenged like men like yeah
actually they don't let her go second
one yeah yeah like three challenge like
they like to have a go like it makes
them like a bit fiery this size matter
uh it's more about how you use it
exactly yeah what's the biggest turnoff
me the guys if it's a boy smells bad
like that's my I do not like a boy needs
to smell macula and like guys you can
like it and he'll boil
ten points and you smell good that you
can go for us from a 6 to a 10 if you
smell good yeah look boy comes up to me
and he's well good and he's confident
I'm like it like let's talk right do I
smell good no right now I just haven't
put anything on you smell like a baby
what's what's your biggest turnoff um
like bad breath is probably yeah bad
breath oh yeah
just smelly people coming like and
pumping energy yeah what the fuck are we
doing oh did you see that no um I'm
going to slow my that shit especially
not for myself out with okay can we rage
else yeah alright shift it up um do you
believe in the one and you believe in
soulmates no necessary romantic soulmate
but just being soul mates I think that
you in life can have like many fun ways
that I think that's all you want
remember was it ran about this I agree
with coffee on this yes
so I kind of had a good deep on this
juice yes I do
I honestly believe that in your like
life part you can meet so many different
soul mates and you don't just have one
soul mate you have multiple ones and
each one will be probably like as
special or more special than the next
one
but I just finished just if it still be
different holier huh
like I think that like you can find love
with lots of different people yeah this
is going to be a different kind of love
and you shouldn't always try and change
love yeah like your soul mate isn't
necessarily like the perfect idea of
what you want you'll find someone you'll
be like oh my gosh why am I so like yeah
the right time - with right yeah timing
I think that the universe gives you what
you need not what you want
and thanks anything timing with like be
greedy guy and sometimes as well like a
soul mate isn't like I posted I think I
saw - forever like sometimes so it's a
forever they got suppose I know you're
gonna be with me with them but you could
also not be with them still be soul
mates
exactly or with other people or and I
also do believe that you can have so
much that aren't romantic like I feel
like I've met so many people that I'm
like you're my soul mate
Kyle she's like my spirit animal you're
right - jackar you just give leave now
goodbye opinions on boys oh oh is it a
new thing that you guys decided to adopt
cuz I think it just came out of no idea
like really alright I come from
I feel like just cause the Internet are
just labeled boys like that girl get mad
with just labeled them
no no but like it was the thing that
happened like it's like this weird thing
like I remember a few years ago I just
got on dates with boys like you'd start
talking to him they take that point and
I'm the same forever well I think it's
just very different
no some things is different literally
this whole something like switch there
was honestly like on a station if I
would get so offended someone called me
that it's not thing to there is a thing
guys yeah girls are not always so
innocent I just think that no one really
knows how to properly date anymore
and I just think that this girls it's
like maybe maybe it's not that like if
you are looking like I don't know you
should be looking for a relationship but
you should just know that a relationship
will come to you when it's ready to come
to you like it's not something you
should ever hunt for and I feel like
lots of girls hunt for love because they
don't have enough love within themselves
to feel like okay by themselves and I
think that every past experience I've
had every dudes gonna die yeah and you
and it's it's hard to like not let it
ain't like new people but yeah when
you're when you're just like focusing on
like anytime someone she loved me and
like make me feel better all the time
then it's like when I got out of that
face I was like no I need a fun day and
myself to be okay by myself sex on the
first date or not oh good you say yeah
yeah I had sex on the first date and
then ended up with the same guy for five
years yep so um it can work
yeah that said I wouldn't encourage you
all the time out of all my girlfriends
on I've had yeah for three yeah I never
did that yeah okay all right I don't
wanna maybe Ike maybe I'm like the
walaqad yeah
so I kept saying the guy that I'd sex on
the first date for like quite a few
months after that we never got serious I
feel like if that's that good but we
weren't really yeah I feel like that's a
thing if you wanted to get serious you
can't it yeah I feel like if you're at a
point where you're like you want to
actually get to know someone hello yeah
you want the sex to actually be like I
was more meaningful like actually good
because I personally enjoy sex better if
it's like what you say about 100 with
that gf fuck girls stories any fuck
girls like who just want you to be in
hey come on I may not have my heart
broken if you talk ah the sex hurt first
time not for me can do but it can hurt
it there being like a rappers fun I mean
I go but good buildings hurting and you
feeling uncomfortable and yeah I'm gonna
tell them to stop and let guys get like
think that you're in like a porn movie
in that like yeah but it just because it
comes very troubling you guys do you
guys talk about the girls they're
crushing on to each other do you guys
have yeah you to talk yeah yeah really
what do you guys like what do you say
yeah just like if you talk to a pretty
girl and actually reply it's like you
say Lanza for the group chat yeah shit
why do dicks float when you have a bar
well they don't like come off your body
butter and fuck off that question
because it is so ray never saw a little
leery strong yeah I thought about that
in a bar in a demonstrate let's just run
aha
and always just be the old maid peeking
out of the top of the wall cause it's
just like I don't know why it's weird
just floats up you guys do you enjoy
being single I did a Twitter in about
this the other it's like I don't know
anything bumping single but I love it
like but then I do have times where I
get so stressed out and I like rent to
mom and her boyfriend Mike why I think
Oh like and it's refreshing because I
I'm so like off the fuck-boy thing I
like being single because like I have
freedom to like kiss boys I'm very close
like I like to like whatever and you
have to answer to people but like I
think having a relationship is something
really special and when it's me the
right person but I think yeah I think
yeah I like being single probably
because I've had some bad experiences
girls but I also feel like I'm a
relationship type of guy yeah Chuck is
such a rural area I feel like I have a
lot to give oh I feel like I'll just
wanna make jeans very good we're just so
good it I think I'd be a good girlfriend

boyfriend Jack oh I think Carly a really
