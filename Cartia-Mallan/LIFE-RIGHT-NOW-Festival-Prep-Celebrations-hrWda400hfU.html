from LA and Suzie and gentlemen our
thermal insulator on quavering alone by
now and really out of it jet lag
we're just getting raw recipe that we
get every time every time
ah haha Jacob Hawaiian your obsessive
life
so now in the blog Molly
Paleogene without Katya
or when twin spires I doubt you will I
got you that yet
oh I love it you're gonna die yes done
I mean and makes getting married today
this is the wedding reception
we have been cruising we needed our
understanding artists enemies commit oh
you know that if you got
morning guys oh you're just woken up and
had some oats I just wanted to chat to
update obviously you guys know I just
got back from LA I'm adjusting getting
back to normal life here in Sydney I'm
here for the next two weeks just got to
get some work done get myself back to my
normal routine before splenda I want to
get back to yoga training all of that I
woke up feeling a bit worse because a
bit of a cry last night obviously goes
so I was at Sammy's 21st um you guys
know I get really passionate about
things I got into a conversation I was
very passionate about and I've got a
little bit emotional and started to cry
because it was like equal rights and in
this case it actually wasn't about women
it was actually about equal equal can't
or equal oh my god equal rights for men
being able to do exactly what we do as
women and that mention of the freedom as
well as not be judged when wanting to
follow a creative pursuit so yeah I just
like hate saying like guys bash each
other up when one of the friends wants
to do like something creative it's
really stupid and I think it's really
mean and it's unnecessary you know that
you're supposed to support your friends
through anything and like so what if
they want to do something creative it's
like kind of different to what you know
the boys do or what it's what you know
what's cool for guys to do I wouldn't be
doing my job right now it wasn't my
friends supporting me was that means I
into a conversation where end up crying
to one of the guys to try and defend his
friend like that's what I'll do because
they just think that like how we're
going to progress as a society you know
girls are really amazing at supporting
each other and building each other up so
like why aren't we talking more about it
from the side of guys to you know like
it's it all matters it all men are happy
women will be happy as women a happy
memory we have their world of you know
men are supporting each other they can
support women if women's of what each
other women can support men and you know
it's a big cycle it all comes
back
so it just like breaks my heart to see
people like being kind and supporting
each other and I just get exhausted
because I'm like why do I always have to
make a comment about everything I was
like you'll allow it to upset me
enough of that I woke up this morning
and I looked outside my window and I
said it is a beautiful day and it is
completely blue skies today and it's
just absolutely something stunning and
sunny and I was like I'm not going to be
sad all that whatever the hell happened
like affect me into today like in saying
that I'm about to put my workout gear on
and go and meet up with Lee and go for a
walk then just edit and go grocery
shopping so I can get some food in this
house and all that so I'm gonna stop
blubbering for a minute I just want to
leave this on saying I just please
appreciate and respect the friends that
you have because you never know when you
might lose them and it really reminded
me like how lucky I am to have
like-minded people that have supported
me through so much and I'm just oh I'm
just so grateful for the people I have
around me so you into you guys so good
morning what are we doing you can't see

favorites um so I'm going to quickly do
my hair brush my teeth and I have to
show you guys because everyone's been
asking because you actually watch my

smell actually like saw that I may like
hang yeah she want us to send you
themself so you would have seen when I
got the package and I was like a month
ago so I have been testing about over a
month and I'm happy to say and I've been
talk to you guys about this because I'm
never going to promote a product I don't
actually use in life and I have fallen
in love with this shelf CLP and I folks
in using it you know getting ready to
Splenda I've been using it for the past
month now but let me show you this is my
brush with morning in mine and say new
product it is the day and night
toothpaste if it's daytime mornings I'm
just going to use this the reason why I
like this is because it's natural so who
don't even look at my nails they're
really tragic eggs to get really freaked
out over keep whitening toothpaste and
products because the ones that you've
previously made my teeth so sensitive
and Hazel's I electrometer see is why I
like these ones is because there's it's
a natural alternative there's no harmful
chemical this vegan no fluoride so the
daytime toothpaste have protective micro
shield wax and these aloe vera to
control the bacteria and that is just I
love aloe and it's love the fact that
there's so many natural products 5q
mineral to tea towels and ya know
chloride fos PG 3 if I gave this a good
try and that's why I'm very happy to be
promoting this product because I'm
obsessed with it along with I use it
with 1 CF weather and mouthwash that we
use
