my bags today edit some videos and I'm
going into glue store to pick up some
new clothes because I'm gonna show you
guys how I stole my glue store clothes
and converse
so lazy I literally just propped my
camera up on my shoebox hi guys I hope
you're all doing well I've had one crazy
day so I think the last thing I found
was me in blue stop picking up some new
clothes after I did that I raced to the
hairdresser and I got my hair extensions
taken out so hello short hair that is
I'm promising myself that that is the
last time unless I have like some big
shirt that I need hair extensions before
that I'll put them in because I just
really really really want my natural
hair to grow and get healthy again I
just hate having hair this length I just
don't feel as confident with that long
hair which is silly so I'm gonna try and
get over that but so now I'm just
showing at home why don't you film this
yesterday but I literally had no time by
the time I got home from the hairdresser
I tried but I got a whole bunch or
yesterday and and I also picked up
another pair of Converse since I got a
home and it's summer here they like come
in and pick out some like summer clothes
yeah so I wouldn't picked out some
amazing clothes for summer and I'm gonna
show you guys I like to style my
converse shoes I just live in my
converse so I'm gonna show you guys how
I style up some of the converse shoes
that I've got with these new clothes so
it's like a Tryon home Tryon whole slash
styling segment of the video let's let's
do it
let's go do it the clothes I have a bit
of a theme going on that I'm loving and
it's really like these pastel tones I'm
obsessed with this one piece and then
this other one piece this is a little
quick preview and I'm gonna show you
guys how I style it up oh my god how
cute is this pesto purpley tone oh my
god that's everything's gonna go so
nicely together okay here we go this is
look number one so I had to try casting
a whole outfit when you don't have
someone to help me film so I'm gonna do
my best to show you guys the whole look
and if a guy's my full look in the
mirror for starting off by styling and
these shoes these are seriously the
comfiest shoes in the world very denim
look with these epic light wash jeans I
love the cut on the ankle here in the
low-rise of the converse
I think the detailing in the frame just
looks
really good there and then these have
the nice is cut all across normally I'm
such a dark wash denim type of person
but I just love how these look and then
I've got it's got this really cool
little cropped stuff see sure in this
pastel blue tone I since we're going for
that light wash light blue I thought
this cropped jacket kind of like
finished off the look well and it all
just ties in the converse add this kind
of cool skater girl vibe to it so yeah I
love it
but I love a bit of denim on denim let's
move on to look number two but the next
look is with styling up these a cute
little pastel purple converse enemies
are so cute for summer just to add a
little pop of color but I've just
starved these shoes up with these
incredible white and canvas pants and
they're gonna be so perfect for summer
that it's nice and loose and I think
they're just such a great kind of fit
they just really get comfortable as you
can probably tell that I just love the
look of the purple with the white it's
really fresh and summery and adds like a
nice little pop of color and I've just
kept it really simple with a little
stretchy white bandeau top like this is
just like you to just like walk down to
the beach like I could see myself like
with my little beach bag you know I mean
strolling along down to Bondi this
seriously makes me just wanna runs right
down to the beach I like go for a little
stroll in this I can't get the full the
full look in alright let's move on to
the last outfit my hands-down favorite
favorite converse ever I wear these
pretty much every day and they go with
every single outfit you can't beat this
style of shoe it's just they're just so
cool so I've styled these with some
little black flat out pants and is epic
it's actually a one-piece swimsuit so
for this look I was kind of thinking
this could either be like just a good
like casual kind of beach day look
something it's like the perfect look to
go to a gig his shoes kind of make it a
little bit grungy and just add a bit
more of like a street style to the look
opposed to if you wore this with like
sandals that would be very girly and
beachy wear this and also check on that
other denim jacket
you would have the perfect outfit for a
gig I'll show you the look with the
jacket on as well I would for sure wear
this to a gig this looks so cool that's
my little try on haul slash styling and
showing you guys how I style my converse
so I just go down and meet my friend at
Bondi for some coffee do some editing
quickly reply to some emails so that's
what's going on and guys it feels so
weird having shower back and just oh I
kind of like it though guys with these
outfits perfectly alright well I will
