down is so long like anxious about it
first off I guess I should say hello
it's been a really long time since I've
filmed I could go and actually know when
the last down video was boost it was
hello
I've missed you guys so so much today
I've sat down to film like a little
update video for you guys but what has
changed and everyone's kind of wondering
like what the hell are you doing kardea
what is going on because you've seen on
in spirit center be havin it heard it
took my mouth as to what is going on
first things first you obviously realize
that this whole backdrop is completely
different and this is because a lot of
you guys already know I have moved out
of the last box I lived in a sort of my
mum in Brisbane like in the city there
in an apartment and now I have moved to
Byron Bay which is super crazy because
all do you guys know that this is like
somewhere that a trouble beeps on the
weekends it was like my favorite place
to come to you just to chill out with
friends I mean lots of
throughout my time I come in here and
now I feel weird it's really strange and
it's crazy so it won't with me I'd like
to still can't believe it a video from a
little while but I was saying I was
moving out with three friends of mine
that all pretty much fell through and
they didn't move on I just decided that
just because it didn't work out moving
out with them I still knew that I needed
to be here I really wanted to be here
for this time for a few months just to
take a moment out to like breathe and
regroup and figure out what I want to do
with my youtube with my blogging with
everything see whales I can try and
expand creatively because they're like
barn is such a hub to so many creators
and has so many amazing people here that
I'm really excited to connect with and
collaborate with and I needed to live at
the beach I was like driving down so
much just to come to the beach and hang
out my friends hands are like screw it
in and move everyone's been asking me
like Oh who do you live with and like
what's your place like I do an apartment
tour and stuff and I do really want to
do an apartment too much but I still
have boxes and unpack I haven't
decorated yet like I'm so far behind I
kind of moved here and it was like a
whirlwind because I got to meet job as
well which I'll get into soon um it was
like Christmas New Year's falls first
julia's he came home so I haven't even
had time to just like to sit and relax
until now like a funny man sit down film
this
for like weeks yeah I'm getting there
with it once I've kind of got a box
unpack and I've got some more
decorations and I'm like actually decked
out this place way that I wanted that
I've totally found the video showing you
guys like my room and the rest of the
apartment in regards to who am i living
with that when I first found this place
I found it on gumtree and I was going to
be subleasing the room from the other
guy that lived here he is now moving out
he's moving to Sydney and I'm taking
over the lease so now I'm renting out
the room to a no lie super cool super
chilled don't really think any takers
that much about my roomie but yeah my
room here is awesome I have so much sale
I have my own little balcony I have my
bathroom a big cupboard and plenty of
ice to film and which is just good for
me like I need to have this space of my
own so I can just relax you guys will
see it eventually I maybe try personal
snapchats and like what the place looks
like so I know you want to see it and I
want to show you but it's just not ready
and I can't really show a lot of it
though just for privacy reasons finds a
very small town and don't really want
we're live so they can't scale my
balcony just come say hey that's the
first thing but I moved out I did that
that happened I live in Rio now I'll
talk about my new job later but I kind
of want to touch on
I guess people have asked the process of
moving out like how has that been for me
moving out on myself I'm only 17 and
pretty much the minute I graduated
school I packed up my and was like
adios I'm outta here like literally the
next week after I graduated this is
quite personal for me I'm struggle a lot
with kind of showing people that I may
struggle sometimes I think or like I'd
struggle accepting that myself because
I'm such an upbeat and happy person I
never get so that anything and you feel
down about anything but really hit me
once I moved here by myself but I do
have my weak moments and it's okay so
pretty much what happened was the first
two weeks when I got here like it was
really fun and then and I was loving it
and Ralph's a my father's is exciting in
new and they admitted that like my mom
left him in that my friends left now
just here and I had boxes to unpack a
new job when I was working at heaps of
guy friends in mind
I just didn't have very many girlfriends
an army which I'm so used to having
lived with my mama always had like that
womanly figure and I didn't have that
anymore was like I didn't have the
stability of that and so I was kind of
like a massive shot to make another whoa
like I'm alone like it's just me here
and obviously I have like my friends
environment stuff but like it's a very
personal journey when you
by yourself it's definitely been like
the biggest learning curve me I'm so
happy it's happening but um I guess what
happened in those two weeks is I just
got really really down and I got stuck
under this like heavy gray plaid a
little bit I don't know how but it just
kind of happened I know exactly why I
happened I think I was feeling really
lonely I couldn't connect I wanted to be
making videos and I had no time to do it
I had no time doing working but I was
working so much like I was so busy doing
so much but I was doing nothing at the
same time and it was so stressful for me
because I loved to stay busy I love like
connecting with you guys I love just all
that I had no creative ideas don't know
what I'm doing kind of thing it was just
this massive like there's like what the
 I struggled to can't let people
know that that's how I felt until kind
of mom caught on that I was really upset
you I was like a look come come chat
let's get through this together we'll
get there light it up and so yeah
sometimes really hard when you get said
you can't help it it's like it's just
something that just comes over you and
it's just about accepting that I think
that was my first thing that I'll show
them accepting the fact that I was down
it was like a shock so I was like oh
something's wrong with you like you're
so messed up like you should we plant
this in an outside patio you're allowed
to be not okay all the time I think that
was such a big learning thing for me
because I saw you two feelings I have
just it's okay like this is normal this
is human feelings to feel sad that I
just yep so the first thing to me was
like accepting the back over and getting
positive and just looking to bigger and
brighter things and knowing that
everything was going to work out and
then it would all come together like who
we are now I feel so great about job
wise the weeper program to write a
message this vintage store that I love
that I've been going to for ages if they
had any like casual spots that they
needed someone just to come in over the
summer to help out with and they'd go
back to me and they're like yeah sure we
love you to come in casually it's like a
few times a week and how about in the
stores it's so good for me I wanted to
do it so I could one learn more about
fashion get more inspiration for
different fashion things I love vintage
clothing like all people that come in a
sellable you guys I've met so many of
you from what I've been working and it's
just like it's fun and it's a normal job
I just wanted to experience that and
like I think also it really gave me a
sense of value for like saving up money
and like I've got goals now for stuff I
want to be saving for what do you plan
to 2060 when I moved to Byron I was in
this mindset that I was going to be
living here dia de los okay five months
of mine then I go to America for three
months and we just hid me like that's my
life
that's why I'm doing all played out next
year all done and that was seriously
having that Maddow I mean at first I
thought it was such a good idea as I get
my last year there No
zone of my goals I like I know where I'm
going and going somewhere and then
although actually happening once I moved
here I was like super lot of super just
all over the place I spoke to my mom's
friends in the really amazing
clairvoyant and I just was like I'm
struggling like what on earth do I do
like I'm so stressed out about nothing
and she was just kind of like you need
to slow down
you need to stop planning you need to
just live in it and it was crazy of me
clamps so someone that just lives in the
moment that I wasn't living in the
moment all I was only thinking about
what I had planned for the future where
I could be going how I could be working
harder the biggest wake-up call for me
because then I realized how much
pressure I put on myself it has
exchanged all I have planned very much
is that I want to keep doing trips I
want to go to Melbourne sometime in the
next few weeks or next month I wanted to
see what it's like I want to go party
there for a bit meet some people there
do some shoots down there I just feel
like I haven't explored Melbourne yet
and everyone's like come to Melbourne
I'm like yes I really want to come to
Melbourne so Melbourne is on the agenda
go back to Sydney I miss all my friends
and I want to do more like little road
trips out make some like footage of that
so I know you guys love that go to more
festivals get you know more music gigs
just be like getting more across much
 and I guess learning more and
experiencing more and just being kid
home fun I'm definitely going to be in
the office sometime around April May to
visit uz and then I want to go to LA for
a bit I want to be able to network and
connect this
laughs American content creators and all
that's if you guys know any good ones
recommend me I'm still definitely moving
to Sydney I don't know when that's
happening I don't know if I'm going to
be here until the end of April and then
move
I'm not going to extend my stamp iron I
don't know what I'm doing so I've just
come with flow with it all following on
from that I just want to say how
overwhelmingly crazy the past two weeks
have been for me in regards to the
impact that you guys have had on me
having a following is so strange I don't
know how to explain it
it's like you see this number on this
creative people and you're like okay
cool like that's sort of good followers
or something but then it's like when
you're actually in meeting the people
that are following you and they know
that stuff about you and it's like you
can just it's like an instant connection
there's no chat it's like I
like you know what's up and I'm like
okay like I don't know how to sign it
when it's just you as an individual it's
just on it has never hit me like you
just I get it that I've got a phone but
it never ever probably like hit me see
impact and I guess what I was had on
people and what they had on me and so
last night when I was walking back from
the beach I met so many of you guys I
just all happened at once and these
girls came over in their life I loved in
this video you did this film shot that
was so nice and you captured it so well
and we love you're still making it open
my eyes off to this you've shown me
there's like you've made me so much more
positive you've done this for me and
that's just there saying you're right in
my face I'm meeting them
there with them experiencing things it
was so normal and you guys so
more so when I was on the beach chillin
I went down to bitch myself in the
afternoon which is what I was to after a
French work and I took like a notepad
with him with me and you I wanted to
write something I thought maybe I was I
wanted to like to think up a new idea
for a film to make or something and then
so I started writing I was kind of
thinking about like the little things
like little moments in life that I loved
it started out as like a video idea and
then I was like no I'm gonna try and
explore something new like a different
way to express how I feel because yeah I
think a lot I just observe a lot that's
why in my films like I try and capture
essence of feeling and so that's what I
did like a sat down try to write three
things that I love feeling that just one
was like the touch of the ocean the
second one was like a connection which I
a lover boy and the third one was joy to
enjoy like my three favorite things so I
started to write that not laughs well
this is weird like everything is flowing
out it's making sense to me and it kind
of is okay and so now
okay I'm going to I'm going to post this
on Instagram tonight like I'm going to
share this and hopefully try and know
people that you can capture these little
moments and that they're actually the
biggest moments and this I was fine
they're so beautiful and so I posted it
and within like one second of posting it
I just like broke down in tears I don't
know what happened I was just laying on
my bed and then all the sudden I was
just like I couldn't even I couldn't
even read the comments anymore like they
were flooding in like crazy and people
were just like you have such a beautiful
mind and admiring what was going on in
here instead of my exterior eyesight it
just all actually hit me like the
biggest rush of like gratitude
get posted the post of what I've written
and then I go to the comments from you
guys that were just incredible and then
I took snapchat and I did this I don't
normally do this this is really strange
for me but I am fully getting teary from
reading the comments you guys are just
written on my Instagram it just it is so
overwhelming to me like still to this
day that I have these people like you
guys in my life that it is so constantly
supportive and getting comments from you
guys saying that I've made your day I've
changed your month or changed the way
that you think about things will put you
in a better mood is all I ever reason I
make the videos I make and post the
stuff I post is only to ever help people
around me feel good about life and about
themselves and the fact that I'm doing
so overwhelming and just crazy
and it just I'm happy crying right now
it's like the biggest like just good
mother this is probably making sense
because it's all just a big personal
thing I guess like I've been through so
much that I've just made it my goal
to only ever try and spread like the
fact that all the love is being received
and people are actually feeling good
from what I'm doing is just so great
like I think the best way to explain
this situation is that
emotional because people for a long time
kind of just look past you go oh like
you've got a following you enough
instantly just think you're a
superficial person and you don't really
give a about much but for me I've
always cared I've always wanted to prove
people wrong and thing like I do care I
think since I've moved out and I've met
so many more of you guys in the past few
weeks and like the comments like they've
just been overwhelmingly like amazing
starting just to really feel so grateful
thankful for you guys this is what this
is all about I'm sorry I did do it such
a sulky and emotional traumatic way
sometimes you just got up the way that
you feel and I'm ready to be more open
so many people youtubers content
creators go down the path of what is
normal what is acceptable not me I want
to show you guys that you can follow me
and know that this is true this is real
I want to make actual change real
difference real movement which I could
change the whole entire world but no
it's not going to happen with just one
person but what I can do is change the
way that people view the world and
people see themselves and the self-love
that they have and the way that they
tackle life and take it on and just have
fun with it
finally like last night I was like
people actually get it they get what I'm
trying to do they
now see me as like this beauty youtuber
they've seen my change they see my
growth of the person and they're
accepting you can't put it into words
like the feeling of being able to help
people and then although one don't know
if I've made any sense this video I
don't know what I've been rambling on
about this was an update video and now
it's time for meals pretty much update
what I want yeah I'm going to round up
here now I'm doing this doing that I'm
creating rules making more films going
to have a lot more barriers I'll try and
mix it up between some normal YouTube
videos like a classical one still with
fashions some look books some classic
YouTube videos of course because I know
you guys still enjoy them but I'm going
to be a lot more film type videos and
while writing more stuff up on my tumblr
so time if you all come on this
wonderful journey with me it's very
exciting it's very scary
unfresh will start anew this is 2016 and
a lot of change and through continued
change and I'm excited and I hope you
guys enjoyed I love you guys so much and
I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
