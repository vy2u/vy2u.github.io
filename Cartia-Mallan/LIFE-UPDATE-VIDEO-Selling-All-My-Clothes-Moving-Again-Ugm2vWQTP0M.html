not that I went anywhere finally filming
another video this is just going to be a
super coda like really quick update
video because I wanted to film my
festival lookbook today but I didn't
have anyone to help me film it I didn't
have much time and I think there's a lot
to talk about
update wise all of these have kind of
derived from questions that have been
asked to me so I'm just kinda like the
root being the questions answering is
one big hole letter you guys were asking
me about my living situation barn like
am I still living in barn and am I like
do I live with now and like what is
happening my moving to Sydney still like
what is happening and you know what I
really wish I had all the answers to
tell you about I honestly don't even
know myself pretty much all I know is my
lease ends in this apartment that I'm in
right now in like two weeks two weeks
exactly and I haven't found a new place
yet it's kind of freaking me out I'm not
stressing though because I know
something will come up when it's right
I'm going to be moving in with my friend
Georgie and that's all I know so far
when you're moving somewhere and
borrowing again because I'm not quite
ready to relocate to Sydney just here
because I feel like I still have a lot
of time to do some working on myself
here and on my content
and it's just like why would you want to
go away from bar like I'm just too
obsessed with the beach I think and
Sydney's so expensive and it's just like
so far the chapel wherever I need to go
and stuff so I don't know I just I'm
just taking it easy as I go not to see
love a bit of h2o yeah I guess I just
kinda wanted to stick to bone for a bit
longer because I am plan on doing quite
a bit of traveling over the next few
months and so just having a base it
would be just so good
praying I find somewhere in the next two
weeks I can move into before I move I
would probably go to America that's the
next thing on my list to America for one
month in June a month all that kind of
like five weeks in June I'm going to be
going over a plane to LA on the first of
June and I'll be staying with Emma for a
bit and then we're gonna be going on a
road trip and then I'm gonna be seeing
ya I'm so excited like honestly I just
thought I'm so excited for that and the
road trip is going to be amazing
there's more information about the road
trip because it's not just a stretch or
actually doing something and this may
involve you guys coming to hang out
then sharing in the nonsense stuff I'm
not gonna give too much away but have
something to of this hashtag you guys
have been saying which is the Messier
famed and I'm gonna say too much because
the video camera and I have already
filmed is in it's been filmed but I have
half the video on my sd card and she
flew away with the other half of it on
arresting hunt so I have to wait for you
to come and mail or towards me Dropbox I
can edit it but anyway I'll be in
America in June and first week is July
so if anyone's around hit me up I'm
definitely going to be doing some
collapse yeah make some cool content
make some films and yeah I'll be good
fun so yeah that's America obviously I'm
so freaking came to the emmerich am I
really
inside honestly since she's been I'm
like talking this fast but I really have
to go soon we're going to a gig but like
this is fine this is fine I'm just gonna
get Al information now you guys just
kind of to keep up um honestly when Emma
left I can't tell you guys I cannot tell
you how much he impacted me and just the
she brought me so much joy and really
like taught me a lot about myself it's
fine we'll be together again soon and
then after I go to America she is going
to come back here we're all gonna go to
Splenda so it's just kind of like a few
solid months together with them oh wait
it's like both the Cleese people
isn't it super exciting um this weekend
in fire and I'm having a yard sale my
friends that'll be only 9th of April so
this Sunday it will be 9 a.m. until 1:00
p.m. the address print is one acacia
straight by the bay all the details for
it will be down below but pretty much I
know I spoke about having yard stuff so
long and finally we're gonna do it I'll
be selling some of my old clothes and
it's in and photos from something I'm
getting rid of a whole lot of stuff the
frame move it's all going to be
relatively affordable though there will
be some stuff that's a little bit more
expensive because it'll be vintage
clothes but then there's some really
cheap stuff that's Taylor and Georgie
and so other girls are also going to
have some stalls there so it's gonna be
it's super sick vintage clothes and
really um really cool pre-loved items as
well along with some jewelry and Sony's
and and I'm actually gonna go through my
room and just be like okay take it and
yeah so if you guys are interested in
coming anyone can just rock up as I say
9 o'clock until 1 o'clock
don't come before 9 o'clock because we
will be setting up but make sure if you
really want to get some your hands on
some good stuff it's probably going to
sell very quickly or at least the good
stuff will go faster come earlier on in
the day but as I said I will be there
until one o'clock all of us will be
there to one o'clock so come meet us
come say hey come buy some goodies it is
cash only so make sure you have enough
cash prepared depending on how much you
want to be spending the next exciting
thing is is so funny like my little list
or just stuff to go through so the next
very exciting thing is on the 30th of
May in about two months time I am doing
something very exciting aligning with
Vivid festival in Sydney it's a big
festival where they have like people
come in and do speeches and talks and
panels and there's nothing like show
thing and there's also crazy stuff that
goes on at the festival out of the blue
I was asked to come and speak on a panel
with some other business people on the
panel panels on the topic what it's
influenced and so they've gotten a whole
lot of different people who are in I
guess influential spots through our
society to come in talk and they're
giving out they'll give us questions and
we'll talk to a large
people about what we think infants is
and honestly this is so exciting for me
because I was saying for ages how much I
really loved public speak like a lot of
public speaking and talking about stuff
that matters and I'm kind of getting my
point of view out there I really love it
like I I can do it through videos but
being able to do it to a large audience
and also an older demographic to kind of
give my point of view on some stuff that
I guess they may not understand because
obviously we're living in a different
generation type of thing I definitely
got some pretty important things I want
to be stating and putting out there and
kind of like turning some heads with the
topics that I might be speaking about
and I think a lot of you may be very
interested and I actually highly
recommend you guys coming along to see
it I think will be a very interesting
panel yeah that is on the 30th of May it
is in Sydney the link up with only
waiting at the tickets below the tickets
cost money because it's a big festival
I'm not getting paid for I'm just going
to tour it was up to me to be free
because I think it's really going to be
quite a good chat yeah and then I do for
hopefully after the panel happens I can
hopefully calm down and have a chat some
of you guys so be quick to get some
tickets they're gonna start pretty
quickly yes so the link will be below
I'm so excited for that I literally was
so
I was saying to Mum like two days before
we got the emails like mum I really want
to start doing things like speaking
about that matters and stuff and
then I got the email and I was like go
someone was listening to me I want to
kind of add in here there's not really
that many more updates about what's
happening in my life besides just that
I've been thinking a lot lately this is
a much more we're taking this to another
another level now I've been thinking a
lot more lately and I've been really
taking time out to assess I'm doing with
my platform and yes I've just been
taking out time to think about what I
want to be putting out there and what I
want to be getting from what I'm doing
right now in trying to get to
appointment myself I'm more comfortable
to express the thoughts that I have in
my mind about social economical
political environmental worldly few type
things because I really care about that
stuff
it may not sometimes seem like it
because I love my videos like fashion
and beauty and like mobile this is me in
a festival but I guess if you've watched
my videos for a while you definitely see
the chain broke I've had as a person in
my mind as it's changed and if you know
me personally you'll definitely know
that I will get into varying fee and
very intense conversations about stuff
that matters to me care about a lot of
stuff and for a long time I wasn't
voicing anything I was just kind of
keeping it all to myself because I was
really too scared to express the views
that I had on things and on
and the view that I had on like the way
that society is going these days like I
was here we want to say this had very
very good and like very challenging
conversations with each other about
these topics of stuff going on in the
world and stuff that needs improvement
and people that need help and what we
could possibly do and for so long I was
like there's nothing I can do my
influence doesn't really matter because
I'm not I don't have a million followers
I ask my like wait but I've got like
almost a quarter of a million people
find me that is a lot of people and the
thing is like from really like I sat
back and I listened to the feedback I
was getting about people saying that
this had influenced them in a certain
way that they went to did that and then
it influenced this person I was like I
do have influence and I'm really gonna
start doing something with it instead of
being one of these logos that sits
around and it doesn't do anything
because it's people like us that could
start changing the world if you could as
well like anyone any one of us could
change the world and I guess you kind of
get to a point where like you you may be
like what I was thinking like oh I
really care about this certain topic but
what can I do I'm not in one person for
myself but another point now I realize
we'll even though I'm just one person
that I have power and I have control
over stuff that could possibly change
and so do you I have a bigger things
that I can't really talk about just yet
where I was going with this but I just
want to kind of Express I feel that my
views on certain things I think we
should start talking about and not
shying away from I'm not going into
depth with any of this up right now but
this is the things I'm gonna be talking
about in the future so one special
conformity you guys know how much I
 hate it people understand it and
help people not have to fit into the box
anymore
the blockage of connection within
yourself and connection within other
people and connection within your
environment and everything within
spirituality this comes under spirit
under the box of like spirituality
climate change and how you can help it
is my problem living in this world
should never be afraid to want to learn
and no one's going to judge you for not
knowing like hey I don't understand this
completely I'd really like to know about
that can you explain it Ellen just hope
to have more in-depth meaningful
conversations and really like helps you
want to like grow as a person and it's
helpful to we need it right now
especially within you if you guys are
the ones that can make a change so start
talking about stuff that matters or
stuff you see on the news and challenge
it I know that probably doesn't make
sense like cardio doesn't rant at the
end of my video but I just want you guys
to kind of know what's coming up what
I'm going to be talking about I'm still
don't worry like I still love making TV
videos I still love making fashion
videos and my wacky like film videos and
yes Chelsea is career back so just look
up what you think you guys know I'm very
sad at time but alongside all this stuff
I realize that I should be talking about
bigger picture stuff as well so I'm at
the point where I'm like what the
have I got to lose I can help more
people if I just express them and I
don't care if there's maybe like a
handful of people that are like what the
 and then there's people they need
to work on themselves if they don't take
time to listen the literally no
like I am talking up and talking out you
guys should be excited and excited to
connect with you guys further oh that is
also got something to do with the Messi
effect which am Emma Emma and I will be
talking about later I don't know any of
that laughs it makes sense but you guys
probably understand
about if you followed me on everything
and yeah I'm more videos coming soon
your slow down a little bit you next
coming weeks it's probably just because
I'm moving this house and I will
probably be stressing out a little bit
so I'll keep you guys posted on my
snapchat which is card email follow me
on Instagram which is Connie Malone and
I'm Twitter just came along and yeah I
love you guys so much and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
