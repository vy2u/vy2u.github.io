guys today I have teamed up with ramble
on the launch of the new lipstick range
for the only one so we will sent me the
new range of these lipsticks and they
are so freakin awesome they're all
bright and colorful if that sounds like
yeah I'll just do like a normal sit down
like maybe that code lipstick swatch
video and I'm talking about the product
I'd show you guys the colors and I was
like that's very not my style of doing
it so I thought what I had in mind to do
was that I kind of said to her mom's
like how about I incorporated it with
almost like a lipstick lookbook with
like an actual lookbook like how I've
paired these lipsticks with some
clothing items you guys all say that
later on but first I want to stop a bit
of a review of the product to kind of
talk about these the lip products and
then just for a little fun added thing
at the end I have showed you guys how
I've taken and four of my favorite
colors from the range and paired them up
with some really funky outfits and it's
kind of like 70s inspire there's sixties
inspired I just love the fact that this
range is so bright and vibrant and the
colors are just so beautiful because I
think people do not wear enough color in
everyday life so it was kinda like a
push to kind of get more color in the
outfits and also in the space of
everything Oh super happy how the
outfits turned out and I love that
little bit though so much fun to film
but yeah let's get into talking about my
I'm personal review of the lipsticks so
these are the lipsticks and as I said
majority of them a pretty vibrant quite
pinky tones and like quite girly colors
start off explaining a little bit about
what they say this product does and how
it works and then I'll give you my own
personal review because I've actually
been wearing these lipsticks heaps after
I filmed like the outfit part of the
video I like fell in love with this
purple color that I have owned and been
wearing it like everywhere these
lipsticks is supposed to be kind of
black and no-compromise all-in-one
lipsticks so kind like all-day comfort
heaps of moisture and long-lasting wear
so that's really great that you can kind
of get that all in one because the worst
thing were some lipsticks that I
previously experienced is one it's like
the color will be really great but then
they get super dry and they rub off
really easily or if they are yet to dry
absolutely pet hate is lipsticks that
are super dry like the one that I can
think of is like Mac Ruby woo how it's
just like so so mattified it's so thick
and so dry it just like gets really
gross when on your lips and I hate that
so the really awesome thing about these
lipsticks is one the colors of them so
as I said they're a really awesome and
vibrant but the thing is they're so
pigmented to in like one swipe it's like
you don't need to be layering and
layering and layering to get that kind
of color that you're wanting all of the
cars are very true to the bullets so
it's really easy to kind of see what
color you're going to get these
lipsticks are super comfortable to wear
formula kind of content like a light
blend of oils which time provides like a
really easy slide on effect which is so
good it's not like a hassle to like try
and get it on perfectly hit honestly
it's like so smooth
and just really nice another one of my
favorite things about these lipsticks is
the moisture that it has in it as I said
I hate it when lipsticks like dry out
your lips even more because ends up
looking really cracked and gross I have
frozen fruit oils which that's I hope
sleeves and they left something
moisturized and for an extra boost that
also put some vitamin E in here which is
really great because it much feels like
I'm wearing a lip balm but it's a
lipstick and it's just really nice so
the push behind it is kind of saying
that it's the old one lipstick it's
moisturizing the color brighter lost for
ages and why they've put the only one
that is the only one lipstick that you
really need which is quite true my own
personal review of the product as I kind
of slipped in there were mentioning what
they've sent me about this lipstick as I
said I kind of after wearing it when I
was filming it
I let this lipstick on with this outfit
and I went out later on in the day and
it stayed on for ages my lips gonna get
dry I was drinking smoothies I was
eating food all I needed to do was like
maybe after like an hour or so like
after eating I like literally just did
like one little swipe it just felt like
a lip balm going on my lips wasn't messy
it's so clean and even if you do get it
kind of like a little bit outside of
your lips it's so easy just like wipe
off it doesn't believe like a dirty
stain there it takes forever to get off
and stuff so it's awesome and that's
what I only love about it I like to do
these lipsticks is also before I apply
them I like to put on lip liner from
Rimmel and I find it's like it brings
out the color even more and also helps
apply or less smoothly if you're not in
so much of a rush when you have time
as you can see from the shots from the
outfit lookbook with the lipsticks have
head
do not laugh at me I suck as lip wedding
I don't live a live lineup but when they
sent me the lipsticks I kind of sent a
Holley bullet - I like try this out
there you go and I'm gonna give this a
go I actually love the effect of slip
lining I just suck and I've got the
worst hand I'm just like so messy with
it but anyways this lip liners are
incredible the only one time used one
before was like for a bright red
lipstick and my lip liner like cracked
halfway through it but this like red lip
liner was amazing I loved it was super
bright and super comfortable it wasn't
too dry like someone will look - I just
really moisturizing which there's really
no tit with like the moisturizing your
face it's like honestly my favorite
thing about it so that's my little
review on the lipstick products even
though I did mention that this is a
collaboration video with Rimmel
obviously all the thoughts in my own you
guys know I rarely ever do any sponsored
videos but I when I saw the range of
their lipsticks that actually happen of
bright and powerful they were I wanted
to get on board and also do the
incorporate the outlets in there because
I really want people to start wearing
more color and get funky with their
outfits and not be afraid to lay a
random stuff on stuff also when I find a
good product like this I get really
excited and I'm so happy about this
lipstick because I have like this purple
just seems to bring out everything in
the toilet right and I got so many
compliments on it and enjoy seeing my
four favorite lipsticks from this
collection and also the outfits I paid
them with leave any future video
requests down below let me know what you
guys think of these lipsticks or if you
use them and if you love them let me
so enjoy the outfits and I'll see you
guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
