covergirl again to bring you another one
bread and makeup tutorial and today I'm
doing like hey I like to call it a
medium glam makeup look like it's not
it's not like glam because I'm still
wearing a lot of makeup it's not like
full bloom so I don't have eyeliner or
lashes anything so just ranking it right
in the middle so I'm just showing you
how to get this look and it's so simple
because the focus is on cover girls i
shadow quads which I'm freaking awesome
because they're labeled 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 like
the colors on the shadow so you know
what order to put the light colors in
it's really easy it steps it out for you
super well and I love them so that
further ado let's just jump straight
into this makeup tutorial so I'm taking
my covergirl eyeshadow quad and I am a
little different I like to start with
number two to enrich my eyelids by
putting a pop of color on first and then
I like to go with number three to frame
out my eye shape so I'm taking this
darker modified brown color to really
like define my crease and to frame this
whole eye look together then once I've
added a bit of definition I like to
intensify this look by adding the
darkest color number four with a smaller
kind of like pencil brush and I just
like to apply this to my outer V like
there's no perfect way to do this I'm
really not professional at this at all I
just lightly blend as you can see what
I'm doing and then I keep going back and
adding a little bit more color each time
to keep on darkening it and intensifying
it and then with my blending brush I go
back over it and blend it all out so it
just like seamlessly flows into each
other and then taking number four and
number three together I'm just applying
this to my bottom lash line then I'm
going back with the number one and
adding this inner corner highlight you
could do it in normal like steps one two
three four but I just like to do this
but I feel like it comes off during
during the time as I'm doing my eyes so
yeah then I'm just taking this black
brown pencil and defining my
I'm waterline and also just really
lightly running it in my tear duct on
the top of my eyelids and like I know
you can kind of see what I'm doing I'm
sort of adding a little bit of pencil
then to like my outer V area like end of
my eyelash again and then with the
spongy side of the eyeliner brush I'm
just going to lightly blend it all out
then with the amazing full lash bloom
mascara I'm just going to be adding
quite a few layers of this to my top and
bottom lashes to really just add that
big pop and intensify it all together
and then with my covergirl concealer I'm
just putting this underneath my eyes to
highlight this area a little bit on top
of my head I just really messily kind of
like dab it on and I blend it out and
then with these two shades of covergirl
foundation I'm just buffing this into my
skin and I'm mixing the two colors just
to try and get the perfect color because
I was wearing fake tan on my body at
this time and then with this covergirl
translucent powder I'm just patting this
all over my face to make sure that the
makeup is set in place all day long
then with my covergirl blush I just want
to add a little bit of life and color
into my cheek so I'm applying this and
then with my smoochies lipstick my
all-time favorite lipstick I'm just
going ahead and applying this to finish
off the look and this is everything I'm
in love with how the eye makeup turned
out it's so simple and really smoky but
really beautiful for a night out I also
decide I quickly mentioned that these
quads do come in for other different
really beautiful shade and you could
pick them up from any Priceline store so
this is the final makeup look I hope you
guys enjoyed this video it's so much fun
making it I love kind of just doing like
medium glam stuff because I don't like
wearing false lashes because they annoy
me and I just like my eyes feel like
heavy like way too full on and I
actually didn't have any liquid eyeliner
today so I was you know how I normally
always do my like big cat eye I ran out
so you could probably add that in it
would look really awesome but this is
also fine too hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video don't forget to follow me on
Instagram and Twitter you know to keep
up with everything that's going on and
years I hope you guys enjoyed this video
