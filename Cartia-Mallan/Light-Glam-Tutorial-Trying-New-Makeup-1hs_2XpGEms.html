welcome to my channel today I have a few
new products in just little books of
mine and I just wanted to sit down and
do a talk through makeup tutorial I have
not done one of these in so long when
it's going to play around some of the
new makeup that I have let's just jump
into I'm going to start off with
Porefessional primer to minimize woobie
pause on that my face is brand-new
freshy was ripped off soon you guys put
this all over and now I'm going to go
ahead and apply my hello flawless oxygen
Wow foundation and I'm running out I
really need to invest in any condition
I'm applying this with my laptop kabuki
brush I really love this primer for a
little bit off this time on this
foundation for a little bit but now I'm
really getting over it and it's a please
don't get me wrong it is a great
foundation I truly loved it for quite
some time I've been through many bottles
of it but I just want to try something
new just good and it has really great
coverage and its really good point I
have fake tan on bananas you know what
in contrast when you and I think I'm
gonna try the Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation it's done intimacies
everyone raves about that I'm so late to
jump on that bandwagon but you know what
whatever I also really need to get some
new brushes so if you guys have like a
brand of brushes that you think is best
let a girl knows I'm on a hunt for
everything then I'm going to go ahead
and apply mate and naked skin and
concealer in shade and medium light
neutral buffer I don't really know what
look I'm doing terms and you make my
usual base cover these pimples here and
then I have this new Urban Decay I
thought it was like a red time I think
it'd be fun to play with that
and this is a really weird order go
ahead and do my brow now and even my
favorite brow pencil would be super brow
pencil by benefit I love this soil and
what I did my brows I just a brush
through them sobs and I kind of stopped
just under the front band or like a
little line under it and just kind of
keep it down everyone since time that
our little method to the brow and I
really need to do too much as mine I
just make them a little multiple but I
just like to brush it all out quick
quick simple I was one day I decided to
do anything really crazy and like fill
my brows and hod cool I would just look
such a good all times I'm sorry about
the outdoor noises it's really hot in
soon exective the Sun finally decided to
come out so I had to keep my window open
my way I wasn't out the wet and then the
makeup and look real word okay I really
didn't want to do my eyes I'm just going
to have some fun playing with 15 you
Urban Decay so this is in the color
spike it's just difficult and I love
color and I never normally play that
much with color on my eyes or color in
my making in general so I was like why
don't you give it a whirl with women you
guys in you can just watch me
experiment with it this may look good or
horrible but we'll just for the try and
I'm applying this with my iMac e-40
blending brush before I do that I want
to test out this matchbox lid primer
that I got and try wow it's very wide
Pat this into my island it's not leave
quite a white mop on your eye one's
going to go in with it apply it to the
center and then I'm just going to blend
it all across the lid and up into my
crease so it's kind of like hombres out
this color is so nice I'm obsessed
really easy to blend that and move
camera once again because the lighting
is changing on the other side
it's placing it on the lid doubling it
across it probably is a much smaller
brush to apply and then was that when I
make sure I spread across the lid and
then just lightly transfer it into the
crate because I'm going to put some
Browns in the crease flow I love that
I'm going to go on my Holy Grail Mac
palette you can see I have used this to
the disk and this is my favorite
favorite a crease shade is going to pick
up that color on my Mac - - for blending
brush I apply this to the crease to kind
of Brown upward and Walker yeah I'm
gonna have blam I want to make this look
is fully going with like eyeliner and
like make this really really glam but I
kind of think I might just keep it more
on the simple side the document is a
little bit more I'm just taking this
palette again with a little pencil brush
and this dark brown shade here that
blending brush just blend out any harsh
lines
all time this other really cool color
from urban decay code extra galactic and
it looks like this it is so beautiful
very crazy glittery ugly red shade I'm
going to put a little bit of this onto
my lid with my Sigma 55 SATA brush gonna
put it on like mainly with a red x oo oh
wow this is very glittery I just kind of
change the whole look okay and expect it
on a little bit into my inner corner on
both sides two times I've done that I'm
going to blend all of these colors out
annexes I make it look very sexy I'm
going to run with the Smashbox always on
gel liner
when or this eyeliner is incredible just
like go to zone flow effortlessly
now don't my top lash line I'm very
lightly just going to droll
since is being run see how that
instantly just kind of made the eyes pop
and then with my applied terry little
cramp shadow pencil is movie color tasty
truffle I'm going to drag it on my lower
lash line making it even smoke just
under where we discuss apply it so since
I already have lots of sentence on my
top lash I'm just going to take my
benefit roller lash my favorite macaw
and I'm going to apply this on my bottom
lashes
I think I'm going to leave the eyes PL
now we're going to have a little play
with face makeup 7 only use cream face
book as my foundation and concealer but
today I'm going to try doing cream
contouring so I'm taking my hula quickie
onto a stick I don't even really have a
purple brush to blend the same way it's
like going to places when I take one saw
my forehead yeah product is incredible I
love the way it just kind of blending
really seamlessly to escape so numbers
of cream contractors any time I've tried
it before just never blends coupling
this does just like look at that but
just really naturally blends in take my
near Allah on light bronze off I want
anything to intensify I'm using this
rhombus it's just a really natural kind
of glowy time okay and then hands on the
most exciting moment I'm trying out my
California flush by benefit and oh I've
been waiting to try this product it is
so beautiful so glowy and peachy and I'm
such a blush girl like I love blush I've
always needed to complete a look
actually really perfectly kind of blends
with the other colors that I've chosen
to do that is hands-down a new favorite
I love does that make my face look
really flush and peach eNOS of the face
and taking high beam by benefit so many
benefits and I'm just going to apply
this onto these points here
I really suck with cream highlighted so
we'll see how I got a little down my
nose and my Cupid's bow I can yell sure
if I should be putting it in my favor by
using this brush but oh I think I put on
lighter much because it is
okay I definitely from way in mono
mention UDL oh okay and into seneschal
help I'm taking my new favorite Holy
Grail lipstick and this is the outlaw
crayon in peacemaker this is what the
packaging looks like it's so handy and
practical who's the most buttery
formulized so beautiful and the color
and it goes on so nicely and it stays on
so long oh this looks puffy this is the
look all complete yeah hope you guys
