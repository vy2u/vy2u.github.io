get this really simple at Lily Collins a
makeup let's just get straight into this
video first I'm going to be starting out
with my very white face as you can see I
thought that since I've got no fake tan
on this would be the perfect time to do
inspire book full of the cons because
she is quite pale this is pretty much
going to be the lily collins inspired
looks is also a good tutorial for people
with lighter skin tone to paler skin
like a nice look that compliments your
complexion to something really different
for me to do but you guys have asked for
it so much over the past few months so I
thought I'd finally do it for as usual
first up I'm going to be priming my face
with my still a one-step correct we
clean that all over my face so that the
makeup goes on easier and stays on for
longer so I'm going to pull my hair to
is just getting in the way now I'm going
to take the lightest foundation that I
could find in my makeup kit from like
last year's winter which is the Revlon
nearly naked foundation and I'm going to
be putting on the face with the expert
face brush by Real Techniques so I'm
just going to be buffing this
to the skin and applying it straight
over the face also excuse my eyes if
they get a little bit bloodshot this
light is the brightest thing ever so I'm
just going to have to try and get used
to it
now I'm going to be concealing my eyes
so I'm going to be taking the Revlon
Photoready
a little concealer stick - right under
the eyes where I've got some dark
undertones there on my eyelids and on
any blemishes I'm just taking my tapered
blending brush to Pat this into my skin
now once I've done this I'm going to set
everything with my Napoleon set pressed
powder foundation I'm just doing this to
give that extra level of coverage as
Lily's skin is pretty full coverage
makeup now I'm going to do this in a bit
of a random order I'm going to do my
eyebrows and then my eyes and then the
blush and lipstick at the end - title
together because I'm just weird and
that's just how I like to do it I have
really full thick dark eyebrows similar
to Lily alright for this I don't really
have to do anything to achieve a full
eyebrow but I'll just be filling them in
as I usually do um but if it was you and
you've got thinner eyebrows I would
suggest I go making them too much
thicker but if you do want like a full
look maybe just fill them in with with
eyebrow powder just a little bit darker
than your eyes if you want to go for
that sort of look
just feeling your usual eyebrows and you
can adapt it to have a way you like them
so as usual I'm going to be taking my
Smashbox I do eyebrow powder and also my
little spoolie to brush them out
then I'm setting this with my elf
cosmetics
um brow gel moving on to the eyes in
this look she has my gorgeous simple eye
makeup look she doesn't have too much
going on with the eyes just going to be
starting by taking my naked 2 palette
and taking the color of booty-call
shimmery white color which I'm just
going to be putting all over the lid and
a little bit in the inner corner she
does have a little bit of a highlight
and color there
it's just
the bronzes palette by Chi Chi I'm
taking this golden orange color here
because in the look she has just a
slight tinge of this orangey tone to
match in with her lips and they need
just a tiny bit and I'm just going to be
taking this to the center of the lid
gonna duck place it there first
and taking a fluffier brush this is just
a Bobby Brown brush I'm going to be
taking this and blending it lightly over
the lid
then the final step for the eyeshadow is
really simple I'm just taking my Mac
blending brush and my Bahama Mama
bronzer and placing this on the brush
and just lightly blending it into the
crease just for a little bit of
definition now taking my eye crayon
pencil from Smashbox I'm going to be
lining the top of my eyes just a really
really thin line blending this out our
smudging mix out into the eyes with a
little brush so just really lightly
smudging this out you don't have to do
this but this is just sort of what her
eye makeup looks like in the photo and
then I'm going to go ahead and wine my
waterline
so I'm taking the runner best lash
extreme blazing was got longer time from
the scar got to be careful using this
one as it can make your eyelashes a
little bit clumpy so I'm just going to
take my time by trying to make them as
long and singular as possible so the way
that I find easiest to achieve that
would have to be putting in the mascara
there and then just blinking slowly and
pulling it up this really helps to
separate the lashes when you just do it
slowly and precisely pull up on the
lashes here's people have a different
way of doing it I find this the easiest
to achieve that look so as you can see
the difference that has made
already in really opening up my arms you
do the same for the bottom lashes like
isn't appear to be wearing any bronzer
or anything too much in the photo what
I'm going to do is just Nestle that I
contour my cheeks just because she does
have quite a slimmer looking face around
here than me I'm going to be taking
Bahama Mama bronzer and my new small
contour
Sigma um fo5 brush and just lightly
contour my cheekbones
for blush lily has a apricot a kind of
orangey tinge a blush color that matches
really nicely with her eye shadow and
lip color now I didn't actually have a
color that was the same as it so I'm
going to be using an eyeshadow so with
my crush Cosmetics palette this massive
a colorful one taking just a random
blush brush of old ones that are am I
getting from orange cars on and with
these orange tones here I'm pretty much
just going to be running my brush from
this color here upwards a little bit
just picking up those orange tones don't
need too much just a little bit and then
just apply it straight to the apples of
your cheeks now to completely finish off
50 Lily Collins inspired makeup look I
will be putting on a song orange
lipstick to tie in all of the colors
together just like she has in the photo
love orange lipstick it works on fairest
skin tones to really tan skin tones it's
just gorgeous and a compliment any sort
of complexion and it Lily definitely
looks so amazing with this color so I'll
be taking the Revlon just bitten
kissable balm stain I'm a 40-year
rendezvous
and then over the top of this I'm taking
the ev1 lip butter in the color to me
fruity this has more of a red undertone
which is sort of what she has and it
also just will make it a little bit
closer and just to finish it all off
