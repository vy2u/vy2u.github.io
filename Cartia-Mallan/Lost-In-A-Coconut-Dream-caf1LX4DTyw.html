what's up guys so I hope you guys enjoy
that that little creative film that I've
collaborated with Hubble essences to
mate I'll give you guys some context
about it which is kind of made no sense
but pretty much it is for their new
campaign called crack the cap and this
is pretty much meaning like encouraging
guys when you're in the supermarket to
crack open the bottle and have a sniff
of the product I was so excited to do
this um kind of campaign because I have
been using Hubble essences especially
the coconut scent one since I was really
really young at a beach house I went to
when you we were younger and it was
always always stuck in the bathroom
there and so I always remember coming
home from the beach and then using the
coconut someone which is the blue one
that I based the video around you like
overwhelming like smell of like a
tropical sense and coconut scent I just
love it it is the most like nostalgic
smell for me I know people like their
childhood shampoo knishes this was like
my teenage years shampooing conditions
and I loved it and I seriously love how
they're all kind of natural scents so
it's so nice like even waking up in the
morning and having all the super like
natural fruity and like floral scents it
was just the best it kind of puts me in
a good mood and it's like all bright and
bubbly so it sets your day off really
really nicely also you guys know that I
love making super weird like creative
films and stuff so this was right up my
alley literally one day we were just
follow home and I was like guys we're
going to the quarry put on anything blue
bring glitter and we're just going to
take a few cameras and swirl around and
ended up being so much fun I hope to
post more kind of creative videos like
this for you guys don't forget to go and
