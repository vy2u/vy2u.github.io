one pump of foundation and I'm cleaning
this all over my face to get a nice
light to medium coverage and excuse my
one broken nail I know it looks so
crappy but enough to deal with it now
see I'm buffing this into my skin and
then I'm going in with my naked skin
Evon decay can seal up in the cola light
to medium and putting this on my face in
the points where I want to kind of bring
out some light and highlight underneath
my eyes chin forehead you guys know the
drill of this then I'm just taking a
light finishing powder and putting this
underneath my eyes and on my like t-zone
area just to kind of set the foundation
in then with my benefit brow pencil this
is my favorite brow pencil ever I'm just
filling in my eyebrows to kind of define
them a little bit more and with my
Christmas in New York palette I'm taking
this light brown color on a blending
brush and just defining my crease a
little bit we're going to keep the eyes
really simple because normally makeup
sweats up in a music festival anyways
and then with the shade banana cream
this is a light shimmer tone I'm just
going to put a little bit of this on the
lid then you guys know I love my winged
eyeliner so I'm taking my gel eyeliner
from benefit this is my favorite
eyeliner I honestly will never use a
different one and just some cleanness on
my lids and I love using brown eyeliner
I think it looks a lot more natural to
smoke up my eyes a little bit and
further define the look I'm taking a
brown eyeliner pencil and putting this
to my waterline and then dragging it
under my lash line and then with a brown
eyeshadow and a pencil eye soda brush
I'm going to put that on under there as
well then it's just putting some mascara
on top and bottom lashes and then I'm
going to be moving on to doing my
bronzer I'm just taking max give me son
and my Real Techniques blush brush to
blend this into my face
my Naz Sarah moon blush palette and
taking these two blush tones here and
popping this on to the apples of my
cheek and kind of dragging it up a
little bit as well and then I'm just
taking my Mecca cosmetic highlighter and
putting this off so that is all the
makeup to this look now I'm going to
show you guys the outfit that I wore
that I had actually planned to wear when
I flew in from Sydney to the festival I
realized I'd forgotten the necklace and
the pants I wanted to wear so I kind of
changed it a little bit this is what I
had planned to wear pretty much just
these black flared out high-waisted
pants and a cool up a puncture my
crochet bag a big belt big boots and a
shell necklace yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I love you a lot
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
