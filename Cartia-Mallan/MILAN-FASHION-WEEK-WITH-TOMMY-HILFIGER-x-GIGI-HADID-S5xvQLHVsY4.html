Gibbs
okay papi we're coming down now going
for them
good money guys okay so I am in Milan
Katya Milan actually whatever I posted
hey girls coming here you guys made so
many jokes about that that's very funny
so it is all like actually no we had
like pretty much a full day yesterday we
walked run for so long and drank two
bottles of red wine and I've eaten
enough Peter impostor already so and now
we're just gonna go and find some
breakfast and I don't even know like
what are Italians here for breakfast as
I'm genuinely confused and curious to
know like do we just eat croissants like
Everywhere's just paste or 80% coffee I
didn't even eat this at home like
at home I never eat Italian food
I don't eat pastries I'm plant-based and
then yeah we're gonna go we're gonna
come back here and pack up our stuff and
then we're gonna check in to the hotel I
think we're saying it the Western and
well I didn't say while we're here we're
here with Tommy Hilfiger we're here to
see this show Hey Italy what's up hey
Josh assume what's up
party of Mila we are walking to find
breakfast yeah I'm hoping that that
doesn't happen today no at least you
don't have a I say it's my luck
would you look at all that good stuff
well that's just coded in chase
the enzyme
in croissant that's what I got and they
got a copy it's my mom we're gonna go
back to the enemy pack our bags up go to
the hotel I feel like leave our bags and
then go to such as eating a pizza for
breakfast I really would never eat like
a pastry
the thing at the westin hello sir I
checked into my room it's so cute look
at this it just looks so cozy and
comfortable and such a beautiful
bathroom the Josh and I are just about
to head out to go do some shopping go
back to Prada and there's a bag of had
my eye on for a while now that I'm
really tempted to get and like I never
normally buy designer like I have one
designer bag and it's lost in me so much
longer than any of my other stuff so I'm
just kind of like you know what it's an
investment I never spend my money like
ridiculously on anything like object
wise materialistically but an invest in
like some very nice pieces so I'm really
tempted but it's a lot of money to put
on a bag so I have to love it I'm gonna
head back and just thought that how much
it is compare my options and yeah but
this is the look for today I'm wearing a
turtleneck this is good so weird made
aware of frickin skirt my white little
Gucci bag I'm gonna have like my big
fluffy jacket and this husband's then
pull silver jewelry and then my shoes
I'm just wearing my platform Connie's
right the lift and that would be fancy
hello we're gonna go do some shopping
I'm probably gonna spend all my money so
basically that is what do you mean
you're really sharing okay anyway okay
look like a lad for this look so this
isn't a lot they wants to buy this
ridiculously expensive bag I send it to
my mom and she was like I was like darn
encouraged me no don't do it but do it
but don't don't do it
I think it's that way no it's not really
advancing on your face
wait can you say it got really bad
breath hmm I'm gonna do a walking shot
like chili
and when you get here it's for a thank
you go
fishy they're already left to the end
sweet yeah what's up we are going to the
fitting for event tomorrow night and the
runway shows yeah so we're gonna go get
our clothes flight the next three days
basically
these didn't make it in here we go
Oh elevator again this is coming like a
tradition quick little snack before I
start getting ready for tonight's event

almond latte so I kind of forgot to film
when I was getting ready but is the look
I'm wearing a bright red pants these big
hail boots mm-hmm
Tommy Hilfiger bag Tommy jacket but it
sports bra and I've judged everything up
with my disco necklace and some start
earrings to the outfit bit better yeah
Chuck it's like massive but we're gonna
make it work are you wearing fashion
stuff Speed Racer we look pretty cool
bro hey we gotta go downstairs now
because our drivers here but I'm gonna
try and film on my phone stuff from

can get but yeah speech you guys laid

Hilfiger and Italy who would've thought
yeah it is really good
hey mom and then yeah after this we're
gonna go shopping and I'm gonna go into
Prada and once and for all see if I'm
gonna get this bag or not I've just been
 talking about it my whole log
piece bye
is we
did you see if I killed a man they are
yeah yes
she was your husband I'm currently in
Prada and I've had my eyes on this bag
that I wanted for like only two days now
but I really I don't know else I don't
like it it left around the place you had
to do it how to get it no what no what
am i I'm just gonna transfer some money
into my bank and like I don't normally
buy this but it's gonna lost me ever and
ever and ever
it's a great idea
look it's a nice bag is it work
get the angle yet is that it you get it
you get the angle dark can we go eat
we're getting mine
nice did you get a new tattoo
that oh I've never seen anything
like that before
that's really that's a really trendy
in the hotel all day but yeah we are
so yeah I'm really heartbroken because
the Japanese place was actually closed
and I've been craving that for probably
since I landed in Italy that's okay
because really bringing Chinese place
right now Chinese food in Italy is
pretty often about that but like
honestly if I'm trying to shove another
piece of paper in my mouth I will
combust so it's kind of interesting I'll
show you guys different find it funny

feel like it would look better if it was
