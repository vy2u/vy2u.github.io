youtuber world today I'm going to be
doing something a little bit different
um
I am actually doing a juice cleanse
today so this means I'm just going to be
drinking um fresh juices I actually did
one of these last year and it was just
really good to cleanse out my system and
just like flush everything out and it
just feels a bit gluggy at the moment I
will just mention to um there is like
proper ways to do this like actual
proper recipes and like proper
procedures and stuff they probably
should follow while doing this but I am
super lazy I'd like a really intense one
last year and I'm like not committing to
doing that I'm just kind of drinking
juice for the day to cleanse out kind of
a bit of my body so we'll see how I go
today I'm going to keep you guys updated
and then a little bit later on in the
video I'm going to talk to you guys
about my diet my exercise staff all the
stuff that I do because you've been
asking for ages I think I have a few
tips that I could definitely show an
eating healthy and all that stuff so be
like kind of like a weird vlog but sit
down video like I just feel like I can't
sit down just talk all this stuff to you
like I'd rather just take you with me
and I'll show you what I do and then I
know that I'm if I know if I know that
I'm filming then I'll make sure I stick
to drinking just juice today and yeah
almost 11 o'clock this is horrible I
just actually went for my walk this
morning I'm going to go and get my juice
and then go to markets now bring you
guys alone
my house y'all we've got stuff which was
sitting around everywhere but we'll get
there soon I just don't remember
what was done
y'all this is so good okay so I just got
my first juice this is a water melone
and min juice and this is if I found my
favorite type of juice to get is what I
had in barley like every day I'm gonna
go to the beach go for swim because it
is such a nice sunny day today as you
can see it's literally been like raining
in barn for the last few days so this is
good good
I can go
please
one is not
now to take
is
I'm on to juice number two this is
orange pineapple and what a Malone
yeah yeah yummy I'm so excited so angry
at myself but I totally knew this would
happen
um I'm hungry so I'm eating a banana I
literally just had the biggest nap and I
hate falling asleep during the negs and
I wake up and I'm so confused and I was
like I'm like energy is low my ions
already low enough but I'm also probably
silly that I've just been having like
fruit juices like I'm an idiot I should
be having ones full of nutrients and
stuff but I haven't but anyways this is
still technically fruit I could use this
we're gonna let you go live back okay I
look crazy like I actually am so I
compete like as I said I just woke up
this whole video I was editing it and I
was like this is such a mess I'm just
confused the entire system we just start
again so a few days ago I tried to do a
juice cleanse pretty much I failed and
like after the second juice a few hours
passed I was just doing work and I was
like I'm so hungry and I started getting
a headache and I fell asleep I woke up
and I was like delirious and I was like
oh my god
not today and then I had a banana and
then I had some watermelon watermelon
watermelon and then I think I had dinner
that night as well yeah next time I do
I'm gonna actually like probably order
it through like a company that has like
all the proper ones because I'm just so
crappy and sticking to stuff these days
like stuff like that because I just get
distracted or I'm like too tempted I
have the worst willpower and I also
don't think it'd be very good doing it
with just fruit juices I really think
you do need like veggie ones because
then you are getting enough like iron
you're gonna have nutrients in the
juices as well so to sort it be kind of
fun it was like a little bit of a vlog
type thing as well um just chilled I
don't know like literally just a
mishmash of random stuff but now I'm
kind of just going to chat you guys
about my diet about exercise I do all
that stuff getting into like weight loss
in this video this is not what this is
about
and just sharing some info there I have
experienced weight loss I am very good I
know a lot about eating right and eating
healthy and what's good for your body
and exercise stuff I'm not a
nutritionist I have none exercise person
I'm not dietitian is a dietician my god
I kind of took this is just what works
for me this is what I do I'm super
passionate about having a healthy diet I
really think it is just everything you
guys don't even understand how much
they put in packaged foods this is one
thing about me I do not really ever
normally eat packaged foods I kind of
ate really processed foods at all I try
and avoid oil I don't cook with oil I
don't use oil and that's personally just
for me because I don't like the way that
it feels in my body if I'm to use oil
and cooking and
coconut oil um I make just spurting out
random bits of information I hardly
think almost a year ago now I went
plant-based so that just means that I do
not eat dairy like no animal products no
dairy no meat no seafood no eggs
none of that when I went plant-based it
helped to boost my energy it helped to
cut my sugar cravings it just helped me
also experience new types of food and
also expanded me to eating a lot more
clean it just changed the way that I
viewed food and also eating for energy
and eating for nutritional values and
stuffs
I remember when I first went plant-based
I was working so much too and I was kind
of just living off bread and I was like
oh
Brent gives me energy and then I
literally get to like like 3:00 in the
afternoon I need to go to sleep because
I was so deficient so I definitely
believe in having a balance in what
you're eating like eating proper meals
you know like clean proper meals
breakfast is so important it starts you
metabolism for the day gives you energy
to start the morning I normally
sometimes I'd like a smoothie I might
have some granola and acai ball pot with
my coffee
avocado ties my breakfast always berries
for lunch I normally always have like a
salad like I always try and have like
lots of greens lots of spinach some
sweet potato maybe like just veggies I
eat a lot of veggies and same at night
time I'll have veggies too yeah as I
mentioned I do not like cooking with oil
i do not like added oil in foods I don't
see how it is necessary and I'm as I
said I'm not dietitian I've never looked
this up I just personally know of myself
when I eat greasy food like if I have
hot chips or something which I don't
normally do but if I do I literally feel
so sick after because all I feel is just
as saturated fats and oils in my body
and I just don't think it's healthy I'm
like and I definitely think after
cutting out as much oily foods or
saturated fats in my diet is help this
helps my body feel cleaner and nicer I
don't eat like any vegan junk food um or
anything like that I have a very clean
diet literally like I'm a bit of a
health freak
I do indulge every once in a while but I
don't ever go and buy like chocolate I
don't really buy sweets I don't really
eat dessert like I'm kind of boring like
that but as saying that I do indulge
when I go away when I do stuff sometimes
I'll go in like you know but it's
different like it's more of like based
around fruit and veggies I don't like
artificially created foods even if
they're vegan I'm like I don't like the
idea of added preservatives I don't like
the idea of like chemically made foods
I'm like how can that be good for your
body try and be as organic as possible
as well it's quite expensive to do I
don't do it all the time but yeah pretty
much
summary of my diet is I just try not eat
as much packaged food I try
and just keep everything fresh I love
produce from markets I'll always try and
get food from markets over the
supermarket exercise wise I love
exercising I do it for my body heart and
soul it makes me feel good it clears my
mind I don't do any like nolle
exercising I literally keep it so chill
I go for like a walk every day or every
second day I just like have a really
beautiful walking track at the back of
my house and most mornings I'll just
take myself for thirty to forty minute
brisk walk like you're not like
strolling like actually try and like you
know get your heart rate moving I enjoy
walking so much more because I can stay
at a steady pace the whole time and yeah
I love walking up hills as well doing
some incline get your butt working it
was just strength a bit more um I love
yoga I don't do it as much when I'm home
just because I don't normally have time
but I definitely want to try to yoga
again same reasons mind body soul it's
really good to like cleanse out do
sometimes when I've got a chance to be
around a gym I love getting into a gym
and getting on the treadmill and doing
incline work so just walking on the
treadmill and putting the incline up
really high I also love doing like
squats sometimes I'll just do like my
own home circuit kind of thing just like
a few squats if you leg lifts like I'm
so inconsistent with it um I really want
to try and get back into like a proper
fitness regime but I'm not crazy about
it I don't do this for dramatic weight
loss I do this to feel good in my body
and look after myself exercise is key
like to just to clear everything like
get everything flowing and moving I
sometimes will also try and switch out
driving places for bike riding or
walking in front always asking what I
recommend plant-based diet yes i 100%
would it has changed my life it's
changed me my body feels you just have
to be mindful about what you're putting
in your body and make sure it's fresh
and healthy and always look at food as
energy you want good food though like
good pure veggies greens anything that
comes from the earth cannot hurt you so
that's like my little motto that I kind
of go by I want to start doing maybe
some what I eat in a day videos and all
that stuff because I love cooking I have
so many good little play
based recipes so if you guys want to see
that comment below give this video a
thumbs up I am going to head to the
beach before this camera dies don't
forget to comment video requests below I
love you guys
lots and lots have a wonderful day and
I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
