how are you doing today I'm really
excited about this video today because
it is something is that is my 101 life
path to becoming a wizard at life to
becoming a wizard in yourself to
becoming a wizard at everything is my
new favorite word wizard earned-income
it'll make any sense today I'm real cars
sitting on my bed as we always do and
we're going to talk about how to get
everything you want of your life out of
your job out of your dreams goals Wow I
have some goddamn respect it just means
a seriously just realistically though
like some excuse about it like don't we
will begin you tomorrow like you're not
going to get a freakin Lamborghini
tomorrow unless you're given like punch
to be that either commonly win the
lottery like let's be real and I'm gold
cats so it's going to be kind of like a
stream of consciousness and it's a chat
if you guys always ask me around the
questions about like how do you do this
how do you have this how do you
everything and this is what I live by
obviously I work hard play hard or how
you clean an effort with my life and I
do work hard there is a few little
things that you can do that make stuff
happen effectively I'm talking about the
idea of the law of attraction of the
idea of manifestation how do you things
work and I'm probably actually not the
best person to ask because I've never
watched a video more of a person I've
ever wrote a book about a or
manifestation and briefly like spoken to
people about these things and I've
adopted what they've told me and I've
made it into my own thing I think if you
want this and you want the best funny
life try and drop all judgments all
expectations or anything about what you
believe or you perceive to be true and
just I have taken what I have to say I
guess really can't exactly remember my
past when I started to manifest and kind
of use the idea of the law of attraction
on your page you know I know what low
rejection is it pretty much is like
I don't know what it technically is I
can google it but what I think the law
of attraction is to me is like making a
wish I think it's like saying like I
want to have a really great week and I
want something like a new opportunity to
come up where I want to meet someone new
or I want to get this promotion or I
wanted on an epic holiday with so-and-so
like it's making like a wish really just
putting out this energy to attract what
you want
so that's part law of attraction what
you want what you're attracted to the
thing with law of attraction and
manifestation is there's a process with
it and you can't be stupid about it you
have to really like think about it
properly like what are one of my wishing
qualities was actually going to like
help my life in some way and they coming
from a genuine place I want to talk
about on vample in my life it okay I
would love to honor started using it and
part of these huge things happen in my
life two of the main ones that always
are the best pieces of proof to me when
they're working out correctly is where I
live my 2,000 situations have come from
the law of attraction and manifestations
completely and I am was moving out of my
first department environment and I was
writing in my journals I was freaking
out because I had one week to find a
house to move into and to round up some
people to move into them with me and I
remember writing down I want a house
environment that has timber floors it is
like a beachy house shack that has a
really cool vibe in it that is a
creative space white walls a backyard
the randa's I want it to be full of
creativity I want a piece full of people
I want to be sort of fun times one other
little dinner what did I get exactly
that exactly everything I wrote down was
included in the top same thing with this
apartment deployment is the weirdest one
yet that I've done this everything to a
tee that I wrote down to my
manifestation to this I also like got
this photo of the internet that I have
saved on my desktop I was like an in
sport of what I want to look like when
it was decorated and I like forgot about
it completely I found
like yesterday and I was like holy
that looks just like my apartment
and like I self-consciously did that
that subconsciously happened let's talk
about how you can start manifesting how
you can start making your life into what
you actually want it to be like how are
you going to get these things it's not
with you just with the energy you are
putting out to people around you and to
the universe so if you're outputting
good energy is giving loving energy
that's what you're going to get back if
you're putting out today or negative
share and how on earth you expect to get
anything good that from that like
give-and-take with the universe give and
take with people you're nice to people
around you and you're giving to people
around you and you genuinely sit with
people and you can listen to them and
you can talk to them and you can hear
what they have to say and learn
something from them that's what you're
going to start flowing into it's all
about energy output that is where it
starts and I guess before the energy
outputs with other people that have to
start with other third start within
yourself so really take your time to get
to know yourself find self-love and
that's not that's not something you find
overnight that is a thing that you have
to practice daily you have to prote
progress with that because there's
recent things I can say with that is
really clean an effort to stop beating
yourself up over things that you can't
help picking on yourself so harshly on
little things and just overthinking them
overthinking and comparing yourself to
people remember what I always talk about
in my videos is you can never be anyone
but you so embrace this body this mind
and its soul that you have and instead
of being negative about it start working
harder towards making yourself a better
version of you just getting better being
much better at life better at being a
human you know if you're flowing on a
path of self law you're trying all that
you're getting better at loving yourself
being alone because though sitting with
yourself
validating you and a wonderful human
that is absolutely perfect in the state
that you are and just having this thing
we like I want to grow and
be amazing not only to myself but I want
to be amazing to the people that
surrounding me when it comes to
manifestation and the law of attraction
these little these big dreams your ideas
everything amazing things that I told
you much my friends that when they like
I had this big vision but I just don't
know how to get there like I have this
goal but oh it's just and they
immediately doubt it and I say that I'm
like how can something come to you if
you're putting up these blocks if you're
going yeah I want this but I can't have
it like how does that work you know like
how can anything come to you if you are
not ready to receive it so they compared
this like relationship but so many years
in my teenage years really wanting a
relationship and craving a relationship
but how was I ever supposed to get that
when I didn't have any love for myself
like I couldn't give love for someone
else so that I couldn't even give to
myself so it was like the fuel tank was
empty and I was expecting something that
I wasn't ready for that I couldn't
actually receive yet same thing as if I
only get a big movie role but I really
talked to acting and yeah it's not going
to happen because this in this and I'm
not there right now I'm all I said like
five excuses as to why I can't have its
own the universe goes okay well you're
not ready for it say the universe is
coming up to you and I saving you know
okay my language is in terms of if we
don't know how life works how
anything happens so I just like to say
the universe as the external magical
magician that seems to make things
happen and this could be God to you if
you're religious is to be anything for
you it could be whatever I just say the
universe as blank so that's that's what
I believe in this man out of school but
how can the universe give you what you
want how can it place it in your hands
if your hand is touching your freaking
pocket you need to be ready to receive
something you need to believe it
wholeheartedly you need to be your
number one cheerleader you need to
believe in your vision 100 thousand
million percent how else will work if
you don't back yourself
with what you want and then the other
thing with getting what you want out of
life and these dreams and ambitions that
you might have is that you're the only
person that can make this happen to
yourself so sitting around and hoping
and wishing and overthinking and
complaining about things that you don't
have yet is a waste of time instead it
comes back to self everything is that
you as an individual if the idea of
forming our self love so that you can
put your hands out and be like I back
myself I packed my dreams I back my
vision like I am capable of this I just
closed it that is why I go into
everything in my life I'm like
progressive I get so much about this but
everything in my life I go into and I
and say there's like a campaign I want
to get there's a role I want to get
there's a holiday I want to go on
there's someone I want to meet I go into
every scenario and I tell myself Katya
you deserve this you're a good person
you put out good energy you've worked
I'm you'll continue what a pod seems in
life is human take I want to do things
because it's going to benefit me it's
gonna make me feel that's going to make
me happy but in terms of meeting and
being happy I can get so much more
energy and love to the people around me
which in turn will make them feel good
and make them happy see how it works is
this energy transfers give and take or
make level how do I believe in my dreams
if I feel there's my actions and I have
doubts and lalala or it's impossible I
hate the word impossible seriously it's
2017 we have technology I'm talking to a
camera right now it has just been posted
on this piece of metal that moves and
that talks to me and that double-din
share that I can walk to where like
everything in this world is literally
magic it is impossible like how do
people make that yeah science and stuff
but I can't wrap my brain around that
selves like it wigs me out the biggest
thing that we found is how the tree
grows like we are think it's so normal
that there's this all this stuff around
us that just moves and happens and
organisms and atoms with all this crap
rain photos as well like light
reflectors on the side look up to a big
blue sky and it's just a big job and we
know about like faith and sailfin saws
and we still think that things are
impossible or that you can't achieve
something when there's all this crazy
 going on around us like just think
about that and it might sound stupid but
it's not because this world is a bigger
bunch of magical things that happen and
none of it is by mistake like everything
here is meant to happen for a reason
you don't have to open your mind to be
like this is so special what I'm
experiencing in this human condition is
so special that I get to feel loved I
get to explore an adventure and see
things I get to see things and I also
get to listen to people and one it's
really about expanding your mind to be
open to things and your mind is open and
you understand there's endless amounts
of possibilities for you and for other
people in this life and you're open to
achieving what you want out of this
lifetime because you're like hey I
really would love to do this but throw
me whatever like we'll see what else
happens I want to talk about the idea of
failure failure and setbacks step back
nothing is ever a setback in your life
you're constantly moving forward if
you're constantly limiting you have to
go into every single experience that you
have in this life and be like what can I
learn from it always questions then go
further and ask questions
selection and questioning is how I have
like sing it out these little life hacks
because I constantly reflecting and it's
not judging no judging is allowed
reflection is a judgmental free space
you are reflecting and it it has to be
in a healthy way we are not overthinking
things and there's no judgment it is
reflecting on so this happened this made
me feel like this then
image like this and it makes me want to
do this so the best things you can do is
like write that down or talk to someone
about it you guys watch my 2016 overview
I spoke about how it was kind of a
really hard year for me a little
negative thing came out for me but I
would change them at all because I
learned so much from them that fact is
this was good as a step forward
in those moments where we have a step
back
it causes inner completion and make
another emotion of anger or set or
stress or supplement dysplasia show
something but most of the time in those
moments it's going to push you towards
something else because you're going to
use that energy to fuel use to make a
change in some way because you don't
want to make that mistake again
it can mean always look at sad or bad
things that happen in your lives and
someone trying to push you in another
direction or something is trying to
stray you away from that so hopefully
I've made a little bit of sense I'm
talking to you long enough I just want
to get on to I have a list here and it
says tool to becoming a wizard but I
guess you could say like self
development tools um and just tools that
I use on bettering myself and my life to
get the things that I want is writing I
love journaling I love writing I feel
like with writing and gentling if you
can take the pen to piece of paper and
just let whatever comes to your mind
flows without judgment everything is
about not judging I first did this and
just did a big turn consciousness it
doesn't want to make sense they can be
random words scribbled drawings anything
but it's so weird to see what your brain
likes to throw them to the paper you can
come up with crazy ideas or plums it's a
salt issue for you or it's almost just
like meditation but writing and it's
amazing to be able to reflect back on
that when you say two months three
months down the track and you're like
wow look where I come from from
klancy at writing is the sweetest thing
to me at home writing it's not every day
every second every third day or I always
try and do manifestations on full moons
if you're not spiritual scrap that but
um you can do them whenever but I always
try and manifest on full moon so
powerful the next thing that I have on
tools is as I mentioned self-love
self-care so nourishing your mind body
soul spirit pushing yourself through
reading writing exercise so that your
body is feeling good and active and
energized the food you're eating really
think about what is this stuff I'm
putting in my body but having a healthy
diet like act creates an inner glow so
you feel good so you want to do good so
that your mind is feeling happy and
fresh
get this in a good healthy faith
Third Point talk to people and listen to
people if you are dealing with a problem
go and speak to someone as close friend
and open up being vulnerable that is the
best thing I've ever learned in my life
is allowing myself to be vulnerable and
to validate it if I'm going upset then
that is okay and you have all right to
feel upset go and have a chat with mom
or a frame and tell them how you feel
and let them will talk to you let
someone make you feel better
and even more importantly listen to
people when people talk to you what are
they really saying what can you learn
from them what can you allow them to
inspire in you and if someone is dealing
with something listen to them and care
about them
fourth is acceptance so accepting every
situation and accepting everything
within you if one is go further up
questions so that in terms of our
customers like yourself as person about
scenarios it's weapons loaded of trust
what your body tells you another good
hack is meditation amazing it helps you
really reflect in
relaxed and calm sorry big make your
dreams outrageous and huge assist
to consist never give up on your dreams
on this life that you want to live never
stop giving this life is bull should be
about giving to others feeling taste but
it's mainly giving like you can giving
is never a bad thing um obviously you
want to give to people that are going to
hopefully give back to you and it's a
fair relationship but you can when
you're outfitting credenzie and helpful
energy to others always gonna come back
and give you a hug and make you feel
good on equally month hopefully it's
helped in some way I'll talk about
