weekend and just having a bit of a booty
stretch and then waking up all my
muscles getting myself prepared for the
day and then I realized that I actually
have to get up
that was so overly dramatic normally I
never really wake up cranky and on my
wake up feeling pretty good most morning
so I just checked my phone and then
scale down a whole heap of water to get
me hydrated for the day I always try and
do this because it makes me feel a lot
better because I never know me drink
enough water during the day and then I
just love to put on some lip balm
because my lips are always so dry in the
morning then I'll just jump on out of
bed like drag myself to the bathroom
first off I just like to start by
pulling up my hair to get it all off my
face so that I can give my face a little
wash and rinse in the sink then I just
drive my face and move on to brushing my
teeth I like to use the Colgate
sensitive Pro relief toothpaste because
I have quite sensitive teeth I literally
cannot function during the day if I do I
brush my teeth in the morning I just
feel so gross and dirty and then after
this sometimes I will have a shower in
the morning but normally I shower at
night so if I do have one in the morning
I'll just wash my body and lightly
cleanse my face then I head back into my
room and I grab my laptop and lay down
on the bed and the first thing I have to
do every morning is put on some music it
is the only thing that helps me get
going in the day so I just chuck on
something for my soundcloud and then I
like to go to my YouTube and check all
of my comments and usually I'll just try
and reply to as many as I can then after
this I just go ahead and check all my
other social media sites and then I'll
try and edit a little bit of a video
then once I start to get a bit hungry
after doing this for a while I will grab
my phone and head up to the kitchen so I
can make some breakfast
for most weekends my favorite thing to
have is avocado toast on Turkish bread
so that's what I decided I would have
this morning because I can't even
express to you how obsessed with it I am
so I'm just grabbing out all of the
stuff that I'll need and pretty much all
I like to do is I grab some Turkish
bread and I just like to slice it in
half and then half again and then what I
do is I just grab my avocado and I cut
this in half and then what I like to
move on to doing is grabbing some really
yummy marinated feta and all I do is I
just grab some of this out of the jar
and I like put it in a little metal bowl
and I just kind of mush it up in the
bowl that sounds really gross but it
puts it in like small little pieces so
it's kind of easier to like spread out
on the bread once it's all done so
here's everything me like I use all
together and I also just like to add
some salt and pepper and also lemon
which is there too and of course you got
to spend a little snapchat to everyone
update them on what you're doing in the
morning so that's what I always like to
do and then I just go ahead and toast
the bread and while this is toasting I
like to put on the kettle and usually if
I'm not like in the mood for coffee I'll
have some green tea so I just put the
bread to the side for a minute and then
what I like to do is pour my green tea
and have it all ready and I'll take it
over to the side and then I start just
putting the avocado all over the toe so
you just spread it all out and then what
I like to do is add the feta put on some
lemon and also add some practice salt
and then it's all done then I just like
to make my way outside onto my balcony
and I'll always struggle getting this
door open with my hands are full but I
love coming to set it here if the
weather's nice and just enjoy my
breakfast and oh my gosh this avvocato
toast was amazing then what I always do
when I'm eating is I'll just scroll
through my phone and check up on like
Instagram snapchat and everything and
I'll always send a little photo of the
view of it's nice weather
I usually end up just sitting here for
about half an hour to 40 minutes
literally just on Instagram and tweeting
people and whatnot but I mean who
doesn't do this it's kind of just to
have it then I'll come back in and wash
the dishes up and put them away and then
I'll make my way to my room and does
anyone else do this literally just sit
on their floor and do their makeup here
I do this all the time so I'm too lazy
to go in time bathroom but I'm just
going to be quickly skimming over my
makeup I already have a video of my kind
of like current go-to makeup look I did
a slightly different one today but all I
did was I just adjusted the eyeliner so
I didn't put on any eyeliner I just put
on mascara so I like to brush out my
hair and style it in whatever way I'm
kind of feeling however it decides to
work and normally it doesn't want to
work so I have to slide part it and then
puff it up and yeah here's a little
close-up of what the makeup looks like
if you do want to see it my um everyday
like kind of go to your makeup look for
the weekends I will leave it in the down
box below then I'll just come over to my
little Beauty desk and grab my dry hair
shampoo and I am obsessed with all the
batiste dry hair shampoos they are
amazing and they smell so good and I
love the time because it's a leopard
print and I'll spray this in and look
really nice and pretty earth on my gray
hairs and then I'll get my Vaseline
moisturizer spray and just moisturize my
arms and legs and I love the smell of
this too and then my all-time favorite
deodorant my Rexona sexy deodorant I
will spray this I'm not all stank here
during the day then I'm pretty sure if
you know me you know that I literally
cannot go very long without lighting
some incense I'm obsessed with the smell
every single morning I will light a
incense stick and pop it into the little
holder and it just makes my room smells
so nice and it puts me in the best mood
then what I'll do is I'll come and
choose what I want to wear for the day
and today I just kind of went for this
like red cropped top thingy with some
jeans and I was chocking on my bed then
I'll come back over to my jewelry vanity
and I just picked out some little rings
and a choker to wear and a little
slit I just wanted an outfit that was
kind of cute and casual because I was
just going out for lunch with some
friends I thought this would be perfect
here's some close-ups of the outfit and
jewelry I actually decided to not go for
the belt because I felt like I was a
little bit too much of it all on
together and thank you to my little
subby friend who sent me this amazing
trigger I am obsessed with it the body
is a blessing girl I ain't trying to
pressure her she messed with the
temperature I wrote this song but I am
the messenger to the metropolis there is
no stopping this that was in kisses yeah
I heard you like chocolate so then I
just had this look at all together there
was some little brand booze and
yesterday way too big my feet very well
and then I was taking my phone my wallet
and really couldn't be bothered taking a
bag today just because I was only
heading down the road and classic me I
was running late tried to head straight
out the door that was my morning routine
I hope you all enjoyed it that's not
literally exactly what I do like every
single morning of the days and stuff but
that's kind of like what I do on most
weekends like I'll go up and have like
over powder toast and whatnot but it
really depends on what I actually have
planned for the day if you want to see
more routine videos please give this
video a thumbs up and I'll ducking
nighttime routine like a school day
routine because it really is totally
different to what I would be doing what
