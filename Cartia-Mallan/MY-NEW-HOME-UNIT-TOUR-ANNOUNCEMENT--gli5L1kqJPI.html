few days to me has literally been so
crazy I have been all over Sydney I'm
currently standing in my new apartment
when I ended the last vlog I was saying
that I was off to do some apartment
hunting and I came to this place when I
was apartment hunting that day and after
I left her I was like that is my
apartment like I need this apartment it
is perfect um it's so bright like which
I'm standing in the room that will be my
room everything's empty in here and has
so much light in here it's so so
beautiful
and yeah we got this apartment which I
didn't think I was going to get it but I
got it so I'm very very happy about that
and my camera is in a bag from I'm not
sure instead I'm just going to start
filming on my phone mom is down here
she's helping me get some furniture and
I'm packing stuff really this is like
the lounge room area but this lighting
is like so bright and so nice I'm so
stoked for that so I can film in so many
different places in here and I just have
to like set up with a line I can
probably use more natural lighting now
yeah I've just been staying in well
Beach for the past few days with some
friends and then before that I was
staying with Sammy and Lee but now I'm
finally in here my furniture doesn't get
delivered until a few days time it's so
so hot today
like literally boiling today so it's a
great day to be moving
so the car is full of stuff at the time
824 we've already done like another trip
home with staff so pretty much I just
literally forgot to film everything that
we've done all day but I'll show you
guys upstairs what we've bought but mum
and I are very tired free time is
currently what we are working with there
is literally just like crap on the floor
guys kind of said that you wanted to see
it like empty so I'll show you I'll give
you a little quick apartment tour so
this is the front door little hallway
let's cool bit like where my TV is a big
couch along here got like a carpet and
then here I'm going to get a nice wooden
table and some chairs and then there's
like storage all there the kitchen is so
nice and big and open and during the day
it's like so bright and all the light
beams and I can come through this and
there's like two big open doors and you
walk straight into your left there's the
spare bedroom and to the right will be
like the main bedroom where mine is this
is the bathroom I just got some little
plans as a bar and all just mirror and
shower and this is my room it's gonna be
so nice when this is all done up and
there's so so much storage here so I'm
so happy about that
tomorrow we just have to go and some
other things get the Wi-Fi set up try
and find oh we have to an order the
couch and just slowly start unpacking
more stuff until the proper removalist
truck comes on Tuesday with all of my
actual stuff like my bed and everything
so for the meantime mom and I are
sleeping on a little blow-up mattress
pad bedroom so came out and I have just
been on another big shopping trip to get
some more stuff and we've just gotten
some cute bedside tables so just got a
table for the outside area
and some more mugs litter my my favorite
thing that we got and I'm honestly like
a copy mother quarter look how cute
these are they're like little like hug
hug I'm like little eggie mugs so I've
got four of these and I think came and
white as well so I think I might go back
and get some water so it's got blue and
white or maybe just get more blue ones
so now we're just going to set up the
internet because we're just going to
bought em modems we're gonna set up the
internet and then go and find a dining
table we found one online like a ones
over here that's like a long wooden one
that IMing it like high bench chairs for
because I just prefer let those because
you can use them as like a work area
that it's like I don't know I just think
they're nice and like sitting low at a
table it feels very formal it's not
something really casual and I also
really want something that's wooden or
completely white you just need to go and
order our lounge and that's not going to
come for another like 4 weeks or so
which is a little bit annoying my
favorite thing that I got from today I
got a neon rainbow light and I'm so
freaking excited for this I have one of
one of these for ages
Lilly and I have just come to Bronte and
we just put in a veggie burrito and we
sitting out what did you get you got a
burrito bowl
gonna watch the sunset hey guys hey I
just went swimming before at Bondi
that's why I looked like a ratchet mess
but we good okay I finally got my camera
out of my suitcase I think this looks a
lot nicer to film with than my phone
okay so I've just woken up in my new
apartment this is my first morning here
by myself and like literally like as you
can tell I'm beaming I'm so happy
because this place is just so full of
light like it is bright all in here I'm
not naked by the way I have a have a
shirt on first like let's just like be
real for a minute
so like first I woke up and I was like
oh my god like what I'm gonna do today
like I don't have anyone around me I
don't live with anyone anymore like I
can't be entertained by other people
anymore like I have my close friends
here but everyone's kind of doing their
thing I realize like I don't have my
full crew here yet you know and that is
so expected I just moved here and
normally I would used to be like like I
put so much pressure on myself I quickly
you need to like find people to
entertain you and then I realized I was
like you're doing it you're going back
to what you did when you first moved to
Barton like you made it a bad thing to
be by yourself
when instead he should embrace this time
alone to get some work done and to like
realign like what you want to do like
reminding myself like hey I moved to
Sydney to grind like to work and
to get some stuff done so do that focus
on that
don't focus on being a little socialite
for once like focus on your work focus
on yourself focus on growing yourself
bettering yourself and getting your
apartment finish like priorities so I'm
happy that I've moved once out by myself
and I know how to push past like that
immediate feeling of like oh I'm lonely
or I'm I got it by myself because it's
not you're not alone you have like it's
like reminding myself I have people here
but it's also just reminding myself that
I have everything within me already as
well I don't need to be around people
24/7 to succeed or to feel happier to
feel fulfilled
or to be entertained and that is really
something that I need to remind myself
more of because I'm such a social person
and I love being around people so yeah
right now I'm just sorting out my
flights to Melbourne for beyond the
Valley festival I just got a face time
with Cioffi
because she's coming to stay with me
she's she is my friend from LA by the
way sorry no LA well she's like from LA
she lives in New York now and yet she's
coming to save me so I was organizing
our flights to the festival I'm so
unorganized I have nothing prepared yet
I've no idea how I'm getting there but
I'll slide out also have to book my
flights home to Brisbane or the Gold
Coast for like Christmas yeah then I'm
just going to do some editing on this
vlog edit my little video from a shoot
that I did with Gabby and then once I
get all my work done I'll see what
Sammy's up to because I need to go and
pick up my other bags from her house and
then maybe just go to the beach for a
quick swim if it doesn't start raining
let's hope not so yeah I will check in
with you guys a little bit later just
about to head to Sammy's and to go and
pick up my stuff and I'm going to use
her Internet to load my vlog I'm just
gonna quickly grab an acai bowl on the
way and some coffee because I have not
had one today yet and I'm in need okay
so I've just come to Sammy's place oh
I'm just here to upload my video stuff
and um and see me and we were in her
hungover State okay so I have just been
home for a little bit just getting at
some life add minutes stuff done and now
I'm just about to run my first bath in
this new apartment I'm so excited just
like have a bath and chillax I've been
doing a lot of laptop watching it so my
eyes feel a bit funny I'm just going to
read from my book because I want to try
and finish this soon and send it in the
post - yes because I think she really
liked it or give it to Mum to read
lately I've just been loving reading
and I'm sharing my books with my friends
I was keeping all of my plants at UM at
Sammy's house and I just brought them
all to the unit today and they look so
cute in the window satellites and I show
you it's so adorable I love having
plants it just adds so much life to a
space literally it feels so nice to
start getting everything organized and
this place doesn't feel weird that
there's not really much nao it feels so
homely and I love it so yeah I'm just
gonna have a bath now
hello everyone you may be able to hear
that outside that is thunder there's a
big storm rolling in down oh my gosh
before it was literally the most hectic
thunder I was like lucky I'm up in an
apartment I thought that was a thunder
stripe it was just mommy I was like holy
 spoke too soon so all day I haven't
really bloated it totally forgot but um
mom and I was running like boring
errands I had ordered a couch I got I
ordered this couch from more expensive
like couch plays and it was going to be
delivered in like four weeks and I was
like you know why and mom found this
like warehouse sale of new brand-new
couches that are like demos or whatever
they're being resold and we found a
couch even more perfect that was way way
cheaper and it can be delivered this
week in there so we cancel the other
couch and we decided to buy this other
new one and I loved it and more excited
for it to come we also bought a bed for
the spare bedroom and we've also just
gotten a dining table and chairs I am in
love with it they do just delivered it
just then and it's all in boxes so momma
I'm going to be having an interesting
night trying to set this up yeah
everything is slowly coming oh is the
Wi-Fi working yahoo and Carmel has just
got the Wi-Fi working now on to it the
UH my dining table okay told you
literally the good news I've just opened
up chairs and it looks like it came or
it comes with an allen key and smooth so
I do not need to go and buy a whole new
toolbox and a start play nice yellow
cute mom got invited by the little old
lady that lives next door to me over for
likes she's like trying to come over to
install maybe it's to like come over for
a drink
her mom's over there like is bonding
with the neighbors I probably should
have gone over but I was like I want to
make this dining table yeah let's see
how this goes yes this is what the
chairs look like I just had to stir this
wooden chop onto the base simple simple
stuff so let's do a number two okay the
four chairs are done now I'm going to
attempt the table here's the table and
all the pieces and these little guys so
we shall see how I got sets mom's just
come back in time to see my wonderful
creation alright let's flip it over and
set it up it is all complete oh so this
is my little dining table kind of
breakfast bar type of thing I'm so happy
with how it turned out is exactly what
I've been wanting for ages I think it
was like a low dining table I like to
kind of sit and chill and work on a jg1
I hate sitting down low at the mean time
I kind of put it
hug tight to the wall to sort out more
space for this area here but I may I may
move it back depending on what artwork
or if I put my big mirror up on the wall
there so I'll just see how it all comes
together
but yes very happy about it so cute I've
wanted one of these for so long
and so the removalist truck has just
arrived and we have lots and lots and
lots of boxes so we're just slowly
helping them and bring all the stuff up
and then I guess today was going to be
unpacking everything okay so I've got my
bed in here finally and now I have to
hunt through some boxes to find the lake
pegs that go on the bottom of the bed so
I'm about to cut these open and try and
find the freaking needle in the haystack
but let's there we go
I got about just rang it for downstairs
and it was a delta the guys like
delivery and I was like what is it and
this is crazy I'm doing this event I'm
called beautify and it's happening in
Sydney on the 17th I'll confirm with you
soon I'll talk more about it later but
I'm doing this event and I'm doing like
doing a panel and speaking and stuff and
meeting some of you guys there but they
just took this epic look at this ready
okay I'm going to bring onto the floor
so you get like the best lighting for
okay ready for this then oh my god look
at this this is crazy like a whole big
lolly cake not even cake thing so I'm
someone else that got sent it's much
that they sent like a big rolling panic
smashing apparently I was like all these
lawyers inside this is crazy
smells so good it just literally smells
like sugar bottom as you guys know I'm
I'm plant-based so I won't be eating
this but I can definitely admire its
beauty um mum will probably be snacking
on this over the next few days and
whatever people come over now at least I
can have like just a big container of
lollies like you know when you go to
like your grandparents house or
something I like an old auntie's house
and they always have lollies and stuff
I'm gonna have a lolly job so you're
gonna come to my house you know what
you'll be in for yeah it's so sweet I'm
gonna read what the letter says surprise
we wanted to give you something really
special to celebrate the start of a
really special event beautify it we hope
you like it and we're looking forward to
seeing you there I was so excited for
beautifying this just made it even
better um I love I love doing events
like this where I get to like go on a
panel and talk because obviously you
guys know I just love talking I just
never shut up but no I think it's really
interesting and honestly think this
event is going to be so fun
so yeah and now that I live in Sydney
it's so easy for me I just like can just
drive there and like just pop down and
like it
I'm so excited so thank you guys from
beautifier and also thank you to the
people at Sydney smash cakes I'm going
to have fun cracking this open and then
um yeah thank you for keeping my lolli
jar full and I'm straight back to
packing and I still can't freaking find
the wheels for my bed I've just opened
like about five boxes so this is it's
really frustrating okay we've got a bed
to set up we are making it progress
okay so I've pretty much just finished
my room it's not obviously finished yet
I'm going to be decorating it and moving
some stuff around but I've got
everything in and everything is on
packed which is the best feeling we
actually got it done really really
quickly and the rest of the stuff in the
apartment is getting there so I think
this is probably going to be my new
filming spot
I'm obviously don't have a tripod up but
I'm thinking of just putting like a
tripod here and all plcs
see out my window um probably just put
like a tripod here because all the
natural light comes in through there
yeah I think I might just be cute to
have just like bed as a backdrop I'm not
sure I'll figure it out but I'm so
stoked that there's just these big
windows so I can literally pop it up
wherever and I can just like put a
mirror in front of me and then I can do
makeup videos and do any time video I'm
so sorry I keep looking the viewfinder
by the way as well this camera isn't the
g7x it doesn't flip up the top it flips
to the side and the focus on it is just
your pain in my butt like it sometimes
randomly just throws me out of focus
really badly but yeah so I'm going to
reply to some emails edit this for the
event that I'm doing is called beautify
and I wanted to know you guys for more
information about it because I would
love to see some of you there so the
event is on the 17th of December it is
the
held being held in a gallery space in
sydney all the info will be left in my
description box where you can find like
the website in the details of the stuff
is going to be other Creators there
other bloggers there there's a lot of
opportunity for networking there's a lot
of opportunity if you're an
up-and-coming blog or YouTube are
ordering stuff on social media it's
really good to come along and get some
like insider tips and that's kind of
what it's like face around make sure you
grab some tickets they're not very
expensive I don't thing I think it's
very very well worth it wish that I had
these types of events to go to when I
was um when I had started my blogging

brand new thing I literally had no idea
