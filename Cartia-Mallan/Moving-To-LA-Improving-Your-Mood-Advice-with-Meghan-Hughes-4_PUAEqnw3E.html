now ain't knowing me little cutie-pie
today I'm here with see incredible Megan
Hughes hello this has been a long long
waiting alive had a big sell products on
this woman from like life all the way
back in Australia and met the other
night at Haley's housewarming and now
IKEA internal read of all Topman so
movie and I was my objective like all
these compliments coming at you and a
little puppy Larry's hid - we all good
job and we have our coffee yet as well
but we just did a pain and I hold on
Megan's channel and we just had about
all posted things giving his eyes and
now we're going to do a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A
because may have a dumb one never in my
life have I gone through snapchat and
seeing people's faces asking the
question and rate up you know we are
getting flooded this litter just going
off I'm ready for it so let's see what
you guys have to say we a sip and
mission card she is where it's so corny
we're literally the most courting couple
of all I say the dumbest if we were
dating people would hate us people be
like oh really I hate crazy okay let's
go honestly I don't know if you've ever
seen the film Palo Alto but there is an
actor in it his name is Jack Kilmer and
he's literally my dream though I saw
many crosses neither Hammer Mac Miller
I don't really how accessible so I can
actually can I be that I could see that
loved him oh you saying little Ari I
don't get in-between that I know but I
support the release date it's not a
bigger but um and my crush god I don't
like what honey you're like don't like
anyone hate all that baby pretty much
should they having all that no one is
worthless no one no one is worthy of
didn't I thought she deserves the world
how come you this is Tony
from California I was wondering if you
lived in the US what city would you want
to live in and watch hmm
I would I would move to LA I am LA I had
a really bad best experience have now
come back huh : and love Rizal was in
love with the place would love to live
in New York but just couldn't you know
like it's a holiday destination for me
likes yeah quick dip and - yeah that way
- I think it's a little bit like New
York is - the line for me it's um and I
haven't I actually haven't been in like
three years and it kind of City it's
like it kind of intimidates me a bit and
like I literally live I live in a city
so I don't know why it does but me like
a little bit to get into groups I love
it it's a special place wait I would
keep it as a holiday and yeah I would
love to lose here because I go so me
great people Leon is this it's just fun
I don't know I really love LA it's
really fun okay and there's so much in
it it's like a home on thank you who's
your biggest inspiration
myself definitely my friend he'll be
mainly it right now in my life like what
can my friends kind of do this thing and
create and like grind it really inspires
me and also just traveling meeting
people talking to people why feel that
answer heavily I was definitely my
friends as well especially some of my
friends out of here who I like to see
 grind in their asses off it's
just like saying people's kind of doing
similar things to and just seeing my
dedication in young people and like
chasing their dreams and like doing just
one night when they create incredible
things you have this moment you like
chuckle you're like I know that I think
when you live like forums that cause we
all kind of like oh I guess
referring to people I know and you know
and the boys love like we live far from
home like you I don't have family in
Sydney or get LA and like so your
friends becoming a family and if I say
like you're grounding stones and the
people that like you know you'll rock so
I think personally that
I should America do you feel like you're
an empath oh yeah totally yeah
best advice I would say Crystal's
grabbing stone Black Tourmaline
wait Leroy escort even though it's not
grinding just very like your presence
with her specifically yeah like I like
stone but I think I do know about white
lighting it's like sometimes they feel
like really empires and impact is like
very sensitive to other people's
energies it's not sure what that means
what I used to before I would have to go
to events a meeting or places where I
have to be around lots of people you
picture that you are in a shower you
can't a shower and you let a like a
white light beam over your head and you
like let it go through all of your
organs or your phone or your body until
it's like drenching you and you just
it's almost like a quick phone
meditation with the white light kind of
don't know what it does but it helps and
it just it's like a lot of like you know
protection to your mind and that
crystals always like more of a physical
form that helps me I would say on my
number one thing that helps me is like I
have this issue at times where like
because I did pick up on so many
people's energies and I feel like I've
read and people pretty well like I
always want to be like the person to
help and I'm hi anyone mom's the same
way and so she's always told me like you
just need it like almost set personal
boundaries with certain things where
late or not you can do it all well yeah
you have to help everyone
I say it's probably the hardest with
friends because like I get really really
 involved and really protective
over you robbery yeah yeah I'll be like
no you cannot play my girl like that I
get so involved and I'm like maybe I
need to take a step back because this
isn't even my problem I'm making you my
problem and that's when because I don't
feel it so deeply like you can feel
someone else's struggle and they're like
hot break aha table like so and I want
you want to like help them exactly so
you can't fix everybody that's probably
the advice oh yeah and you kind of just
have to accept that and just
that boundaries yeah
I cardia what's your favorite memory you
guys shared
when we finally decide if your life
decided because I was right a week at a
house feels like forever but really look
I think the favorite memories will stop
the column yeah like I feel them I'm
convincing how to come to LA because I
know that you will love Byron I can just
see her barely running around the beach
like oh and firing for all like it with
my pale skin fire it is you'll get up to
like it's just institution it's all
coming you know like this is this the
start of something definite it'll
survive to be here with you yep whoa
now I feel good in your eyes and I feel
in my heart this is the start of
something new if you guys live the
deserted I would to believe one food
item for the rest of your life of the
island fluency love you chickpeas I live
for chickpea I'm gonna say something of
wealth and man cuz I like you kidding me
but I eat so many bananas so many of the
love bananas that would definitely be
like I am cheek pico or high E but like
I appeal ego cooking that is okay so my
question is what do you guys like
competition there okay so what's the
position you are so easy to go along
with like it's because maybe you are so
friendly so nice so positive but we're
just fighting as well and you're just
like so good with advice like when I had
her all he's talked just now you should
go up with it but she was just like
chewing lights up with information she
could have still decrepit and I'm just
going to go on right now and you're
existed okay and I was just like so
video sitting that like wow what an
incredible woman I definitely like you
and what doesn't so what that's so kind
on what is involved in ourselves
I was like I submit for quick and me not
people I think the exact same thing
about Megan like before I even met her I
was like I know how like the you know
what someone has a good energy and like
I'll see just is like no my
name is live it I just knew it I'm just
obviously a homey feeling I'm hardly
feeling and just like I just think
you'll with it like I love people that
are just like you know what no
like to positive anything it's like it's
a someone and I just think like you're
back in your dreams and like you're
doing what similar you know when so
similar I can see your aesthetic and
just the music like you were right they
were there yeah like I'm looking at
music well I'm like old her red clothes
