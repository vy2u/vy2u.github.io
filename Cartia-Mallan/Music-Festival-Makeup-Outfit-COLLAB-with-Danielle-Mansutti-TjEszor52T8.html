hey everyone so today I'm doing an
extremely exciting video this is
possibly one of my favorite videos I've
ever filmed on my channel because today
I'm going to be doing my second a
festival makeup and outfit kind of video
this festival video I am colliding with
the very beautiful Danielle Mensa D now
she is one of my favorite youtubers and
I'm so excited to be colliding with her
she's so sweet and has awesome at
YouTube videos so I highly recommend you
guys go check her out her first of all
concert a little clip here she's just
done this really gorgeous very festive
Lea kind of smoky eye makeup look with
gorgeous lashes and really cool kind of
blue and white facepaint around her eyes
and a really nice little purple lip so
if you guys want to see how Danny
achieved her like festival look I'll
leave the link to her channel and also
the link to the video and the down bar
below
moving on to my festival of today I've
gone for a super super glittery fairy
bohemian kind of look I've just done
pretty simple makeup but really gone
crazy with glitter and a few buildings
on my head and stuff this look is super
easy to recreate it's nothing difficult
at all and it's really easy to kind of
incorporate a little bit more of
yourself into this look because it can
be changed
however with whatever kind of thing in
the reason I was most excited for this
video is because I am a crazy festival
head I literally live for music festival
they'll literally be craziest and the
most
amazing thing that you could possibly go
to I think music festivals are just a
really great place where it's all kind
of about the music and it's all about
self-expression so I think where's a
more perfect place to really like do a
crazy out there and a crazy makeup block
or something that just like expresses
what you're all about and it's just so
much fun to be able to like dress up and
dance and have fun with all your friends
it's all kind of like clamped into one
place I'm so excited for this year just
because I'm like determined to just go
to every single music festival that
there is an Australia like I didn't save
up some money so I can make this happen
that is pretty much all I have to say if
you guys would like to see how I achieve
this makeup look and also want to see my
outfit and please keep watching the
figure first up I'm taking my Rimmel
lasting finish primer to prime my face
so that all the foundation comes down
all day it's gonna be hot and I'm going
to be sweating a lot so this will kind
of help it's down for a little bit
longer then I'm taking my concealer and
putting this on all of my like problem
area spots and I had a lot of pimples
coming through when I filmed this so I
had to cover them all up and I also just
like to put this under my eyes to get
rid of all my dark circle
then I'm mixing my L'Oreal Lumi and
infallible foundations to get the right
color and I'll just be buffing these two
into my skin with my flat top kabuki
brush from Sigma taking my Mac Studio
Fix powder and my Real Techniques face
brush I'm going to be patting this all
over my face to try and help the
foundations down for longer just to
really set it all down next I'm taking
my true essence eyebrow pencils I've got
one lighter one and one dark one and I'm
just using the lighter one to fill on
the top of my eyebrow and then the
darker one for the end of my brows then
with my gimme brow I'll be putting this
all through my eyebrows so that you can
set all the pencil on place so it
doesn't start like leaking during the
day then I'll just be applying my nice
casino bronzer to my cheeks and like on
my forehead as well to give a nice
bronzy look my blush I'm just applying
this Too Faced Loveheart blush sorry I
lost the proper footage of it but it's
kind of just like a pink sparkly blush
and I'm just applying this to my cheeks
and then bringing it up towards my
temples
now to make my face really super dewy
and glowy I'm applying my Mac soft and
gentle highlighter just to my temples
and I'm going to be bringing it to the
bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow and
also I apply a little bit just under my
bottom lip taking my two Faced chocolate
bar palette I'm going to be using this
really shimmery kind of pinky champagne
color first up and just applying this
all over my lid and really highlighting
my inner corner then with this light
brown matte color I'm going to be taking
this and applying it to my crease to
define my eyes a little bit more to
highlight my brow bone I'm taking soft
and gentle again and just lightly
patting it across the bone here to make
my face look even Julia with that dark
brown eyebrow pencil I used earlier I'm
just going to be putting this underneath
my lash line and also putting it on top
of my lash line and each time I do this
I'm just going to be kind of smudging it
to give a really natural bohemian kind
of iced smokey eye look you could say
then I'll be taking my they're real
benefit mascara and really pumping up my
lashes and I'm putting on quite a bit
just because I'm not applying any liquid
liner today and finally for my lips I'm
taking honey love by Mac and a plane
this is a base coat and then afterwards
I'll be going in with my Kiko lip gloss
which is a little bit more of a pink
shade just so it doesn't look like I've
got like concealer lips going on okay so
that is all the makeup done now it's
time to move on to like the face
decorations and all the glitter I think
I might just be easier if I talked to
you guys for this part
- voiceover and try to explain but
pretty much I have three little tubes of
um different types of glitter so I've
got these bigger silver like sparkles
they're like bigger ones and then I have
really tiny thin and not serve that
little white clear ones which look so
pretty in the Sun and I've got these
little mini silver stars and then I also
have some other little bindi and I might
just stick a few on my head or down near
my eyes or anything just once I finish
the glitter we'll see what other
decoration might look nice really when
it comes to putting on glitter on your
face on your body it's really just kind
of like a spontaneous and do it where
you want to put it or where's
comfortable for you it literally looks
good anyway I'm going wrong with tucking
some glitter on your face so I'm just
going to have some fun with this and see
what turns out looking good I probably
recommend you do this outside and not be
like me and do it inside right now
let's stand up and it's going to be
glitter all over my floor my mom's not
gonna be happy but I'll be happy because
I really don't care this little ol of my
room so I love clear down to get started
and putting glitter on my face and I'll
speed it up a bit and you can just see
and I will see how it all turns out and
by the way I don't actually use any glue
or anything to stick the glitter on I
just use my finger and hope for the best
I don't know if you can really fully see
in the camera just because they are tiny
little sparkles but pretty much I put
just chuck some glitter all across my
side of here inside here and sprinkled a
little bit my forehead we put a lot
around my chest just below it the
necklaces now I'm going to go in with
some sparkles that you can see a little
bit more because these ones you can't
really see as much on camera but in
person when you're kind of in the light
your face it's like it's just fully
sparkling
pretty much I've just come back and I've
stuck some little bindis on top of my
head now you can literally do whatever
you like if you have prettier bindis or
like you want to draw something on the
top of your head you can do that I just
wanted to add like a little something
something more up there and that is
pretty much all of my makeup and face
and glitter complete I'm going to move
on to showing you guys my outfit pretty
much concludes this video I hope you
guys enjoyed watching this as much as I
enjoyed making it for you guys I'm
literally like a little five-year-old I
still have so much fun playing with
glitter and chopping it everywhere
