a video that I think will help out a lot
of you guys who may be in need of some
tips for a music festival I've been to
quite a number of music festivals and I
absolutely love them I think they're
incredible and I'm getting really
excited to just talk about this topic to
go through a whole list of things with
you guys that you should probably
consider before going to a music
festival most of these things here have
been learnt as I went I learned the hard
way I have a little list tip number one
for a music festival prior organization
it is so so important to just be
organized best thing could possibly do
is just make lists like right down soft
before you're leaving so then you make
sure like you packed everything you need
you've got everything that you want to
take don't forget important stuff that
you need aka a tent is if you're sure my
friend forgot a frickin tent to go
camping at a festival for a week and
luckily I'll see Mel here had a spare
one to chuck all of my clothes and stuff
into and so she ended up sleeping in
that yes way of organization you have
with your friends like make a Facebook
group when you're planning for your
festival if you've got a group where you
can all chat and like talk if you guys
doubling up on stuff that you don't need
to bring like how you getting there what
your plans are communication with your
friends is really important as well so
make sure everyone's organizing it on to
this stuff because worst thing to have
is you're all organized and your other
friend or friends or whoever is just so
not with it and bringing the team down
you don't need that plan your outfits
ahead of time like if you know you're
going to a three-day music festival say
plan out day 1 day 2 day 3 like you can
alternate between whatever days you wear
them but if you have your outfits kind
of sorted
you won't over pack okay that's like
totally a lie I had most of my outfits
planned before I went and I packed a
ridiculous suitcase I'm very ashamed of
myself
but don't be like me and don't do that
because then you have to walk through
the freaking UM campsites with a big old
suitcase and you just look like a bit of
a loser no shame if you plan your outfit
so you have a rough idea you won't over
Park because you don't want to take
massive bags it's just a pain especially
if you're walking everywhere to catch up
bosses and it's just anyways even if you
guys bring a few extra pairs of clothes
and stuff you and your friend to my
alternate clothing and just make up
weird outfits all rewear stuff I'm
really cares or what you wear just as
long as you feel good then you'll
radiate some positive nice feels about
yourself and people we like what a cool
chick what a cool dude
this is supplies for men and women we
are not gender biased here no no point
to this only applies if you're planning
on camping at a festival which I highly
recommend you do a camp it has the
option of campaign it makes the
experience so much more crazy so much
more unique and really different and fun
but if that's not your cup of tea then
you can just rent out a house or
whatever you want to do say you are
camping uh make sure you prepare for
like all types of weather music
festivals are usually planned and just
really weird weather times like for me
with falls festival the whole week
before Falls it was just raining
non-stop and we got there and it was
perfect weather but it was so hot I
cannot even express to you I was dying
like I'm not to wake up and I'll just be
pouring down rain like you need to be
really on to it with the weather stuff
pack um top so then you put them over
your tent and over like your food and
stuff
make sure you have like a big canopy set
up things you can put everything under
it make sure you have raincoat umbrella
warm clothes cool clothes clothes you
can get dirty in gumboots
don't forget gumboots it's just kind of
like make sure you have a few or like
not a few but like at least two good
pairs of shoes you can wear your feet
are gonna get so socks and make sure you
have like a backup pair of shoes or lots
of band-aids or a tough feet that can al
withstand the pain because I always end
up with a million blisters after music
festival okay next thing money
make sure you've planned ahead and you
have enough money
once I've paid for my ticket I try and
save up at least a few hundred dollars
that I can have all in cash to bring to
the first most places won't take F pots
or anything so make sure you have cash
on you don't keep all of your money on
you when you go listen to band
keep most of your money in a separate
wallet in your suitcase with your tent
locked or whatever I would normally each
night like that we'd go or each day that
we go out of the festival I bring enough
money for me to get some food and just
like back up money I want to buy drinks
or something oh that's for like bringing
money but in regards to how much you
should be spending on a festival trying
to keep it as cheap as possible this is
what I do like it always can get really
really really expensive
so just try and keep everything cheap
bring all of your food from home I may
share enough food like think of cheap
meals you can make at the campsite don't
go spending a whole lot of money on the
food from like buying it from actually
at the pencil even it's really on me and
like you're walking past and smell it
you're like resist what I would do is I
would eat like the food that I brought
from home like during the day and then
at night time I'll have like one hot
meal and that would cost like almost 20
bucks because it was just so expensive
so that's what I do I didn't end up
spending that much money at Falls for
example like I just did that if I'm one
drink from a festivals like nine ten
dollars and it's just like so um if you
can just organize like sneaking in
alcohol I am sorry I probably shouldn't
be saying that but sneak a little hint
just do it lots people do it it's not
hard at all especially if you campaign
Google like ways to sneak in alcohol
places there's many creative ideas you
can try tip number four bring a pouch
bring a portable phone charger it's
really really hard especially when
you're camping at music festivals to
charge electronics what they will
normally have is a thing called Locker
boxes it comes with a like phone charger
what I would do was I would have a
portable phone charger that I would
charge at night
and I grab it in the morning keeping in
my bag during the day so I wouldn't have
to keep going back to the locker but
important it's probably like one of the
main things you want to bring it's
really important to have a phone on you
at a festival because if you lose your
friends it's really hard to find them
normally because there's so many people
and it's not fun when you get lost by
yourself in a music festival and you're
walking around for hours trying to find
them well it can be fun like it what
about like but I always like to have my
phone charged so I can keep in contact
with everyone take your photos snapchat
etc etc tip number five get creative
with your camping area and with your
outfits like just in general get
creative music festivals are an awesome
time where you can be really self
expressive you can do whatever the hell
you want pretty much it's just like an
area of free self-expression which is
why I love them the most
anything goes no one's going to judge
you for it so um get funky with your
outfits if you want to wear something
really crazy or you've always wanted to
do something with an outfit or a look or
a costume sort of thing just do it some
people just look absolutely incredible
at music festivals I get so much fashion
inspiration of people by watching like
what they paired together and like
everyone comes up with the coolest thing
so you definitely wouldn't be out of
place if you rocked some really funky
outfit I think of more stuff off the top
of my head about music festivals that
you guys probably should know um some
people hate them some people love them I
think what you just have to do is before
you go to one is just get your headspace
in like this element of kind of just
like whatever let's just have fun like
whatever happens happens kind of like a
whirlwind like a big three day four day
whirlwind where you're like non-stop
you're going to be tired and exhausted
by the end but you will meet so many
cool people you'll have so many profound
experiences that they're all so worth it
I think everyone should go to music
festivals least once in their life they
are so much fun um there are some big
ones coming up if you guys live in
Australia that you might want to know
if you don't know about them but there's
one coming up called groove in the moon
which is held all across Australia and
kind of random places and that's just a
one-day festival but for example like
what you could do this is what I'm doing
with my friends they are going to the
groove in the moon which is in maitland
in New South Wales and we live in quite
Brisbane obviously so what we're
planning on doing is making it kind of
like a three-day thing so we're going to
make it into like a road trip whether
it's worth the one-day festival things
since there's no camping that we're
getting a massive group of friends
together and glit going to leave on a
Thursday morning road trip for that day
stopped off at a beach along the
coastline and New South Wales camp there
the night I will sleep on a beach I'm
not really sure we don't really have
money to book accommodation so kind of
winging it there and then we'll drive
for the next day on Friday do the same
thing and then on Saturday morning
finally get to Maitland and go to groove
in the mood for the day and then sleep
in the car and then drive back to
Brisbane but that's what we're doing for
that um so you just have to kind of get
creative with stuff like that and make
it more of an adventure for yourself
it's so much more fun when you can kind
of like do a road trip version so yes
everyone's been asking me what groove in
the moing - and I'm going to make LAN so
if any of you guys going let me know
I'll probably see you guys around
they're having a good old time they can
all have like a gt-r now Jango used to
watch like all of these old girls going
to music festivals and I'd be like oh my
god like looks so freaky and so cool at
the same time and I was so intimidated
to go to them and then I went and I was
like I don't know why I was nervous
these people are amazing like the people
you meet at music festivals God bless
their souls I love them they're the
coolest people throw such chillers like
they don't really care and they're just
having a good time with their friends
and I love it I hope you guys have got a
bit of an insight or my tips were
helpful they're kind of the ones that I
like to follow before I'm going to a
music festival so I'm going to end this
video here thank you all so much for
watching you're going to agree with me
let me know I'm really excited hopefully
me a lot of you guys there it's going to
be a very very very fun time
and he have y'all enjoyed this video and
get me under here well there's a cat in
the bush there I wish my fat drop was
this stair I should pack it up for this
video
rude my camera never ever decides to
focus properly and then I end up sitting
there while filming a whole video and it
doesn't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
