showing you my current foundation
routine okay so first I like to start
with a fresh clean face I'm going to
start by priming first I'm using my ELF
mineral primer and my still a one-step
correct now lately I've been liking to
mix these two together because there's
still a one-step correct
just evens out my skin tone and the
other primer just gives it a nice finish
and helps the foundation go on so smick
these and to apply it all over the face
with my hands next I'll be taking my new
elf 2 and 1 highlighter and concealer
and are we placing this underneath my
eyes on my nose forehead and any other
problem areas I also like to just put a
little bit on my eyelid to reduce any
darkness then taking my Mac one eight
eight brush I'm just going to be lightly
blending this into the skin okay I'm
going to be taking my new favorite Make
Up For Ever HD foundation I'm just
pumping up one pump on the back of my
hand and using that same Mac brush to
blend it in now I'm going to start out
at the bottom of my chin and blend down
towards my neck just to get that color
in because there's a little bit darker
than my skin tone as I did have fake tan
on but it's slightly coming off I'm just
going to be using some light brush brush
strokes to UM get it in nice and evenly
as this brush is smaller it is a little
bit more precise so it does take a
little bit longer but these strokes will
help the foundation have a flawless
effect and it will stay on quite well
next taking my under-eye concealer and
my Mac prep and prime highlighter oops
okay I'm going to be putting this
underneath my eyes to you a really nice
highlight as I usually do just to
brighten up the face and then what I'll
be doing is taking the Mac's prep and
prime which is more of an apricot tone
color I'm going to put that just
underneath to give a flawless finish but
to also help blend those colors in so
the high light isn't too harsh and it'll
just warm up my skin tone all together
I'm going back with that Mac brush I'm
going to be buffing that in just with
the light strokes again
then taking the Revlon translucent
powder I'm just going to lightly Pat
some of their underneath the eyes to set
all of that concealer in place so it
doesn't crease then for the rest of the
face I'm going to be taking my Napoleon
set powder which I very sadly have hit
the pan for a while I'm going to start
by putting this around my neck first to
blend those colors in to make sure that
it's all there's no major lines there
and then just putting it around the rest
of my face as per usual that's pretty
much for my foundation return it look to
the rest of my face
okay so right now I'm just brushing out
my brows and then I'll be taking my brow
pencil and lightly filling them in as I
usually do and all the girls with hands
inside the dream so now we live now I'll
be taking my other really great
two-in-one Elf product which is this
eyebrow gel with a bit of color in it
and I'll be putting that through my
brows then with the other clear side
I'll just be brushing this through to
set it all in place now taking my new
Kardashian bronze eye which I love I'm
going to be taking this on a big kit
just face powder brush and putting this
away my chequebook to give a nice bronzy
sort of glow
and that's kind of what it looks like
just a gentle contour now I'll be taking
my intro powder brush and just brushing
this all out and blending it through
there was my Too Faced blush I'll be
taking this in a nice natural pinky
purpley color and putting this on my
cheeks
now this really pretty Smashbox
highlighter I'm going to be putting this
above my cheekbones as per usual
now for the eyes I'm just doing
something simple starting out with my
Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre I'm just
applying this all over the lid to give a
kind of natural cream color now for
something I've been loving to do lately
I'm just going to be applying brown
eyeliner just underneath my waterline
not quite in it just on the lash line
there I don't know I feel as though it
opens up your eyes in a strange way but
I really am liking it a lot at the
moment so I'll be applying that to both
eyes now is my master precise arm liquid
liner from Maybelline I'm going to be
lining my eyes
and I've just used a little eyeliner
brush to get the wing there to make my
eyes sparkle a little I'm adding some of
my color tattoo um cream eyeshadow and
just putting it in the inner tear-duct
and all over the lid and then just
blending it out forgot to do this step
before but I advise doing this before
the eyeliner then I've just put my
benefit high brow high beam um brow
highlighting thing I think that's what
it's called under my brows and I'm
blending that out now just reply
applying my there real benefit mascara
all over my top and bottom lashes then
I'll be applying this amazing better
than sex mascara as I do like quite
full-on lashes all time then my favorite
um soft pink nature lipstick I'll be
putting that all over my lips for a nice
nude pink color I ended up changing my
mind and wanted to do something
different so I put my ELF pink lipstick
up then I just added some cute gold
earrings to finish up the look well
that's everything so thank you for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
