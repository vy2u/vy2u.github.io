we all have those mornings we wake up or
not feeling to agree it was super tired
feeling rundown seeing a bit dirty my
hair normally is always something really
oily if I've had a big night out maybe
he's feeling a little bit hungover who
knows what you're feeling but you just
wake up going a bit yuck
if you're leading a super busy life like
I do it's super important to me to have
just days where I am doing a bigot Clint
so today I'm going to be running you
guys through my detox slash cleanse
routine it's a great thing about this is
that you can incorporate this into
everyday life and make this more of a
lifestyle than just a one-off a detox
day so once I finally rolled out of bed
this first thing I will do that just
makes me instantly feel better is jump
in the shower and wash my hair this
video concept came from the new Herbal
Essences detailed shampoo and
conditioners really love the natural
sense of the white tea and mint and is
going to go on with shampoo I'm all
about beautiful smells and I really love
natural scent but these new shampoo
conditioners are pH balanced and they
gently remove everyday papaer it is like
pollution sweat and build-up so this
shampoo contains no silicones colorants
or heavy residues and it's super gentle
enough for everyday use I'm going to go
ahead and wash all of this out and then
I'm going to be focusing me conditioner
on the ends of my hair where my hair
seems to be a little bit more dull this
is fun for you guys - wear that I like
chatting - while having a shower my
question is I wish you guys to like
smell this really catalyzed by um
the white TN meant champion position
really helps bring shine into the head
I'm just going to massage this all
through my hair and then going to wash
it out and I kind of love how is
inspired by this whole essence range
because I've never done a hair detox
before I am so all about my Hayes I've
noticed and there are so many plumes and
air when you go outside like your hair
is constantly getting so built up with
stuff so it's so great to kind of have a
champion conditioner that we use to
detox daily and as I mentioned my hair
towards the ends never get as much shine
as I want so this product is so
incredible for adding shine back into my
hair and just making it feel super
lightweight and not so heavy I've given
my hair a big detox and a big wash I'm
going to be using my a sub body cleanser
and I love this stuff because it has
such fresh and very like earthy tone
smells in it and makes me feel super
super clean once I finish doing this I
just like to stand the shower for a
minute take a big deep breath and kind
of just have a moment to stop my day was
like a positive mindset especially if
you've been feeling a little bit not so
great in the past two days or the day
before it's really great just to take
this moment okay jump out the shower
obviously I just dress my body pop my
hair up into a towel wrap and then I go
ahead and brush my teeth give them a
good scrub and then I love to put on a
face mask I'm using my absolute favorite
su-kam skin detoxifying face mom just
going to apply this face mask and then
I'm going to let it sit but it really
spoke into my skin and while I'm waiting
I will go into my room or go sit on the
couch or go to my balcony and do 15
minutes of meditation if you're trying
to have a day where you really want to
clear your mind and relax this is
hands-down the best thing that you can
do meditation helps just really Center
yourself and just get rid of any
negative thoughts clear your mind space
and it also will really energize you for
the day ahead so once I finish
meditating I am normally feeling it
pretty great so I just roll off my bed
and go on watch off my face mask after
my face mask is off I just like to take
my hair out I had a really big day
planned for today I kind of like to just
get into
blow-drying my hair
it away I'm styling it right after I've
showered otherwise I will honestly
procrastinate once I actually do need to
get ready for whatever work it is I have
to do that day because my hair always
takes a little longest and I'm such a
hair perfectionist I always want it to
be lovely so I just go straight ahead
into blow-drying it and then I will just
style it up into whatever hair look I
want to do and once I've done all this
since I'm a very lazy person and I don't
need to get dressed completely and do
any makeup to the day I still have quite
a few hours to kill and relax before
work was starting I just put my pajamas
back on and I took myself into the
kitchen and days right
maybe my stomach feels a bit bloated or
I just feel like I really need to clean
my insides the best tips I have to do is
be lemon and basil water so please go
ahead and grab a big jug of water and I
like to cut up some lemon put some ice
in there and then I just mixed in some
basil as well this tastes incredible and
it is so amazing for your body once I
made my lemon water I just went straight
into my room and started to clean up all
of my mess and I know this can be such a
pain to do but you'll feel so much
better and it's time for some breakfast
my favorite favorite time of the day or
my detail today today I want to make a
really yummy green juice full of great
vitamins and it's just super delicious
to make but I think you have all my
ingredients here and then I'm just going
ahead and grabbing my big a nutribullet
mix the cup and I'm placing all the
ingredients in the to my car and once
you put all your desired and greens you
can pretty much adjust this to whatever
you have obviously whatever flavors you
like best in your smoothies
and then just go ahead and blend it all
up I'm going to pull my smoothie into a
glass and then what I love to do when I
just have a bit of extra time in the
morning to chill out I like to get off
my phone get up old technology and just
grab a book and while I like have my
smoothie lay on my couch and just chill
out for like half an hour and do some
readings is so important to kind of help
your brain just chill out for a bit and
get offline because we're constantly
online normally I also added some
exercise into the routine so you can
either do exercise if you have enough
energy in the morning which I love to do
that this morning was upsetting just
like no way I had to get straight to
shower but sometimes doing any afternoon
is really nice too just to end your day
clear mind so the third tip for detoxing
is if you want to detox your base once
you finish cleaning your apartment maybe
like vacuum get it all completely tidy
using a smudge stick as well can really
help just clean up the energy in the
area at the energy in the space you can
also kind of smudge yourself which is
super super nice you just feel so clean
and amazing after honestly so many ways
to do a detox these are my favorite kind
of ways that I love to incorporate I
literally incorporate these into my
everyday life really just love the light
clean and happy kind of feeling you get
from toxifying your home bodies are the
main things I love to do it's so
important to take time to care for
yourself your body your mind your soul
your space especially and of course your
hair if you like me I'm just my hair is
my everything but all of this put
together is just super important to stay
at looking fresh and feeling good from
the inside because you just feel good
inside you will shine and radiate
outwardly so I just encourage you guys
to kind of never let a bad day get in
the way
oh you're kind of flow of your Zen so I
really encourage you to kind of turn a
big detox day and incorporate it into
your daily routine
