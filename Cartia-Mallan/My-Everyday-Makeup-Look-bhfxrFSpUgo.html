today I'm going to be showing you guys
my everyday makeup routine um I have not
found a makeup video in literally feels
like forever so I'm really excited to be
doing this one a little disclaimer I
don't actually wear makeup everyday I
barely wear any makeup because I live in
a beach town I work from home so I'm not
really always like heading out if I do
go out I just like put on maybe a bit of
mascara but this is my everyday makeup
that I would do if I'm going out like to
lunch or to a meeting or if I was going
shopping or something you know what I
mean so like don't think like Chuck on
all this makeup every single day for
just life admin stuff I'm too lazy I
wish I was um like proactive enough to
do that but I don't I have been doing
this exact same makeup for honestly
almost six months now I am kind of at a
point where I'm like I don't even find
some new products and um shake it up a
little bit next week when I head to
Sydney I'm going to make sure I go to
Sephora and I go into the city and I go
buy some new makeup because I am
actually hopeless I've had the same
makeup for almost a year now and um just
because like I've been so busy though I
haven't been focusing on doing makeup
just cuz I've been traveling and making
like travel videos and stuff and all
those sorts of wacky films but now that
I'm home and I'm like getting settled
again I'm so excited to get back into
doing makeup and like playing around
with different makeup styles doing some
like creative makeup looks and stuff so
I hope you guys are excited to see that
again I mentioned this on an Instagram
post of mine every week I will now be
having one Beauty video so maybe makeup
or skincare or something and also just
another normal video so maybe I can vlog
or just a sit down chatty video I'm just
going to be mixing it up heaps but
trying to level it out with people that
want to watch me for beauty stuff and
people don't wanna watch me for the
other stuff so then it'll totally equal
and even and I'm excited just to test
out a few different things anyways
enough of the babbling if you're not
already subscribed to my channel make
sure you go down below and press
subscribe make sure you follow me on
insta
Graham and Twitter and snapchat I hope
you guys enjoy hope you enjoy and let's
just jump straight into the makeup
okay so first I'm starting out with my
favorite foundation the hello flawless
oxygen Wow and I'm just putting this all
over my face is honestly my favorite
favorite foundation I just ran out as I
filmed this video then I'm taking the
Rimmel match perfection concealer and
popping this under my eyes to brighten
up my under eyes area and then I was
going to be patting this in with a
little concealer brush and after this to
set all this in place I'm taking my Mac
just normal face powder away now I'm
putting on some pawpaw orient first and
this stuff is so good and moisturizing
it for the lips then I'm going with the
powder way ahead of myself just then
then to just define my eyebrows a little
bit I'm just taking a spoolie brush and
brushing through them and then lightly
kind of penciling them in with this
eyebrow pencil that I honestly no idea
where it's from I've had it for the
longest time and then just setting it in
place with some brow gel from Mac then
with this light shimmer tone I'm popping
this all over my lid and to define my
crease just with a light brown color and
then I like to go in with this brown
eyeliner from Mac I don't like using
black eyeliner it just looks kind of
funny on my eyes but I love doing brown
in the waterline underneath and on the
top lines and then I just like use my
fingers to smudge this in to give it a
really kind of just like grungy kind of
look to it and then to darken even more
I take a pencil brush and some dark
brown eyeshadow and put it on the bottom
lash line and the top lash line then
with my roller lash from benefit I'm
going to be popping this in my lashes on
the top and bottom bronzer I'm going to
be taking Mac give me Sun and this is my
all-time favorite bronzer ever on just a
Real Techniques there's actually their
blush brush this is my favorite brush to
use for our bronzer because it just
blends in really really well and then
with the Too Faced at all I don't know
what's what it's like a little love
heart blush I'm just putting that all
over my cheeks and then to highlight I'm
taking soft and gentle
another one of my Holy Grail products to
highlight and then just this little next
lip gloss to put on my lips so this is
the final makeup look thank you guys so
