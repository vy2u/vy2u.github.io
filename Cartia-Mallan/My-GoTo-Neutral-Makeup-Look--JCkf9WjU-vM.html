you this really simple versatile neutral
makeup look it is my go-to look and it
is really easy to put with any lip color
in the video as you can see I show three
different lip colors that I think suit
it well but honestly you can pick
whichever your favorite color is and use
so I'm going to be starting with my
still a one-step correct to prime my
face this will just help to even out my
skin tone and it will make sure that my
makeup stays on all day next taking my
Sigma flat top kabuki brush I'm going to
be using my lumi foundation by l'oreal
and also the in aqsa BB cream the
illuminating one to give my face a nice
natural glowy look now I'm just patting
this into the skin and also using small
circular motions now once I've done this
I'm going to be taking my Mac Pro
Longwear concealer now I'm just putting
one pump on the back of my hand
and then I will be placing this under my
eye and I'm also going to drag it down a
little bit to give a nice highlight in
that area just under the eyes
I also like to do is put a little bit of
the excess concealer on my eyelids as my
coloring is a little bit off
also I drag some down the bridge of my
nose and on my forehead and my chin just
to highlight these areas too and once
I'm looking like a ghost I also take my
other tapered Sigma blending brush and I
just Pat this into the skin because I
find it easier than sitting there for
ages I'm just blending it with my finger
but whatever works for you go ahead and
do so this is the concealer all done and
I just go ahead and blend it all out
again with my flat top kabuki and the
excess product then I take my revlon
colorstay translucent powder on my
setting brush from Real Techniques and I
just lightly set the concealer to make
sure that it doesn't crease or move
since I want to keep my face looking
jewy I'm taking the excess powder on my
powder brush and sweeping this across my
face for my eyebrows I'll be filling
them in using my Smashbox joy kit with
this angle brush and this spoolie now
I'm just taking the lighter color first
and filling that in and then the darker
color on the ends I promise I'll have a
tutorial tutor tutorial up really soon
and I'm just setting them with this elf
cosmetics setting brow gel which I love
here's my eyebrows all filled in now
I'll be contouring my cheeks with the
Bahama Mama bronzing powder and my
napoleon perez blush brush I just want
to UM nice light contour so I will just
be blending this in on my cheekbones
I'll also be lightly contouring my chin
and just a little bit putting a little
bit on my forehead to to give my face a
little bit more color I'm taking my Mac
bronzing powder just to warm up those
areas even more now I'm not taking too
much just a little bit then with my Mac
blush in the color peachy keen I'm
putting this on the apples of my cheek
and then just dragging it up over the
cheekbone this color I love it gives a
really like simple natural kind of
flushed look it's not too over-the-top
and it's just gorgeous with my Too Faced
shadow bon bons palette I'm going to be
taking the little eye primer that's in
this kit it's got a really nice sparkly
Mutual tone to it which I think I love
the way that it looks when I'm just
doing simple eyeshadow looks it gives
something a little more with the look
then I'm going to be taking this Sigma
flat shading brush and this color
vanilla which is a nice white color to
really block out this color on my eyes
just give a neutral look
then with a nice light brown color I'm
going to be taking this on a flat brush
and just lightly defining my crease with
this color
to give my eyes even more depth I'm
taking this blending brush and a more
apricot color in this map powder I'm
going to put that right over the top I
just like the way that this color looks
it gives my eyes definition and I just
think it's simple but nice at the same
time then with my stiller in the light
palette I'm taking the color kit in
which is just absolutely gorgeous color
it's this light sparkling vanilla color
and I'm just putting this on the center
of the lid and near the inner part of my
eyes just to open them up completely
once I've done this I just like to blend
those two colors all together with that
same blending brush as before gone back
and highlight my brow bone and then I'm
taking the high brow eyebrow highlighted
on my waterline to open up my eyes even
more and then with my Mac Brown eyeliner
what I like to do is tight line and do
the waterline at once so I use the eye
line and just close my eyes it looks
funny but it works well then to wing out
our teeth to wing out to do my winged
liner I'm taking the super slim I think
it's called super slim eyeliner I'll put
it all down in the description box what
I use but I'm just doing a nice wind out
eyeliner as usual pretty much do
whatever sort of eyeliner you like here
you don't have to include the eyeliner
but now for my favorite part and I'm
using my new Jordana best lash extreme
volumizing mascara the one that Lauren
Curtis has and yes it is amazing I do
definitely recommend everyone goes and
get this but I'm just applying this to
my top lashes and also to my bottom
lashes to open up my eyes now you can
put as much or as little as you want but
I love to get quite a bit on just to
make my eyes really pop then taking my
Smashbox highlighter I'm going to be
putting this just a sort of where I put
the blush is to give a nice highlight
and glowy look so there we have it
that's pretty much my face makeup all
done now I have three options to choose
from for lips because honestly any
lipstick goes with
this makeup so firstly I've got this
little rosy pink kind of neutral pink I
don't know how you'd explain it color
it's really cute I think it just is
girly and fun and just something simple
if you wanted to glam up the look a
little bit more there's there's more of
a fuchsia brighter pink ready toned
color so I'm so bad at explaining what
colors these are I really don't know but
I love this color it's really gorgeous
once again pretty girly and just really
cute and then finally if you wanted to
stick with something really simple and
really neutral I have this nice apricot
color it's pretty much just like my
usual skin color but I love the way that
it makes my lips appear quite a lot
larger so if you could please leave in
the comments which color you like the
best I'd love to hear what you guys sing
so this is the makeup all done together
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
it's something really quick and easy and
I can't wait to see you guys soon thanks
