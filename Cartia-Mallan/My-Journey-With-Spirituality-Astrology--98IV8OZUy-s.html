welcome back to my channel who today is
an exciting day because i'm going to be
speaking about something that is well
and truly long overdue something that is
very dear to me i am very passionate
about it is extremely crazy that i
haven't spoken about this any sooner
than now so i'm sorry for that but i
will explain why i haven't really talked
about it much
today i'm going to be speaking a lot
about spirituality astrology my journey
with it before I probably saw this video
though I just want to make a quick
disclaimer to say that this is my own
personal story my own personal beliefs
this is not for everyone not everyone
believes in this you do not have to
believe in this I completely respect all
religions everyone's own individual
belief system everyone has their own
kind of thing that works for them and
that is totally okay so this is an
accepting space to just have a
conversation about this so no leaving
anyone hateful comments not that
obviously you guys don't ever do that
you're literally all angels but I'm just
saying because it is a very
controversial topic that some people
over my time of kind of speaking to
people want to what about it some people
just don't have nice things to say so if
you don't believe in this if you don't
care about this if you think this is a
bunch of mumbo-jumbo and leave any
negativity behind if you want to open
your minds if you're more than welcome
to stay on and watch but if you're going
to just be disrespectful and rude
you can click off this video it's not
for you and no being rude to anyone else
in the comments below who are expressing
your opinions this is a hate free zone
so if you're going to taint that should
it's not that you guys ever do that
you'll literally blow my mind how sweet
you all are anyways let's get started so
as I always do because I have an
organized little cookie whenever I do
sit-down videos I always wrap myself up
a list and I still always somehow end up
bubbling a family to talk about is
answering because
of why is it taking me so long to speak
about spirituality at astrology because
you guys obviously know if you've been
watching me for a while you'll know I
always tap it into my post I'm never
very uptight about it but always I
actually know in some centers
I am very upfront about it but kind of I
sprinkle it a little bit in everywhere
and lately I haven't really been
speaking about it much I'm going to be
completely honest with you guys and my
journey with spirituality and astrology
and just living more of a spiritually
inclined life and more connected to my
own personal spirituality started when I
was pretty young it started when I was
in high school kind of like grade eight
grade nine and so obviously those are
really hard years um I I was not
surrounded by people that had the same
view any time I would ever speak about
it
people would literally just give me
looks and be like you're a
weirdo like and I just kind of got
really shy about it ever since then one
conversation that I get most shy and
timid about unless I know that someone
is also spiritual then I just got a bit
I don't know someone well enough I'll
never bring this up really or like very
quietly be like have you considered this
what start siding you like going into it
like that also kind of knew that I hated
when people would force their views down
my throat so I never wanted to come
across as though I was enforcing a
lifestyle or these belief systems upon
anyone else it was a very personal thing
for me to grow into and it still is
eternally personal for me but I've kind
of sat back for a while and watched how
it influenced my life and I just don't
think I can sit back and not talk about
it anymore because it's really changed
my life and shape the person that I am
today so I if I can somehow help you
guys do this and that is what the
intention is behind thinking about it in
this video
so spirituality and astrology are very
crazy topics a lot of the time if you
ever talk about like five kids or like
anything to do with like I know
supernatural type of things we've been
brought up to believe that magic is not
real and that these things are fictional
and that it makes believe you know like
we watch Disney movies
and all this magic stuff but it's very
scary and hard to believe that maybe in
this world that is actually things that
can't be calculated by science and maps
and stuff that things sometimes just
happen and that is the way that they are
supposed to happen I can understand it's
extremely scary for some people to kind
of comprehend especially if they are
very straightforward mind which everyone
as I said is completely different in
what they believe and how they perceive
the world but yeah it can be hard for
some people to open up to this this as I
said too many times open up to em you
keep going cuz now I'm rambling but yes
that's why I kind of tweeted like asking
some questions about what you want to
know about spirituality / astrology and
you guys really wanted to know how I got
started on my journey how I got into
this why I went into this that when I
was younger as I said I go into this
when i was like in grade 8 / 9 i was
like 13 inch growing up I was extremely
intuitive my mom always would tell me
that I was telepathic and I was like
what are these words like I don't
understand and I always grew up kind of
around older people avoid speaking
people listening to older people a lot
so I had this brain that was forming
like a teenager brain but I also had
this very strong side of me that I never
knew what it was when I would just
understand things very well to do with
life and to do with the order of things
and I don't know I know what can explain
it it's just the way that it was for me
and so spirituality to me was something
I really welcomed and really wanted to
learn more about my mom kind of always
would talk to me about spirituality like
style signs that really just all started
out with me always kind of looking at my
staff my time olio so obviously Leo's
love to know about themselves like I was
always really interested to like read
what my personality traits were and it
was really cool because I definitely
associated extremely strongly with
everything that it said so I was like
wow this is really cool so it kind of
sparked from an interest of that so
every chance I got if I was in a
bookstore files at markets I'd always go
through the books and try and find
astrology books then it formed into me
wanting to learn about every single
staff line I'd always ask my friends
what star sign they were I would kind of
analyze their personality
and like compare it to what something
online would say what a book would say
and then I started looking into
compatibilities between saw signs and
then blah blah blah all went from there
for me and then really from this point I
kind of started meeting some of my mom's
friends that was very spiritually
inclined when my mom had a close friend
Julia who was a psychic so that is her
full-time job to do reading for people
she read all sort of astrology stuff it
all just was so interesting for me so I
started really talking to people
listening to people and doing my own
research I just kind of Google Google is
your best friend when it comes to
spirituality it has every single answer
you could everyone and I'll talk about
stuff about psychics later because that
is a whole nother thing I'm trying to be
extremely broad when I think that this
planet no way but at with your
spirituality I know a lot of people that
follow Mia are very spiritual and very
punches and openness which on to this
but if you're not that is not a problem
like we're not judging anyone here like
everyone has to start somewhere
on a journey with anything another
question you guys asked a lot on Twitter
was what are some books you've read like
what are some people you watch how do
you gain your knowledge on all this so
my main things I mentioned looked a lot
online I read just astrology books just
like literally ones that are like all
about the style science they can really
explain quite a bit here as I mentioned
my friend Julie who is the psychic I
always read her Facebook posts I spent
about this lesson it's not like she
always posts around every full moon
every new moon retrogrades
and just kind of comments on things that
are going on in the solar system that
may then in turn affect you and like
outrightly saying this is like being my
own personal proof and study with it the
things that are going on up there
do affect me like they affect me like
you know how everyone kind of goes like
oh my god it's a retrograde and
everything stops going on or wrong and
like your phone breaks and then trip
over and you lose everything on your
laptop I think people like a kind of
like switch on with retrograde stuff now
it's kind of when like a planet moves
back with so everything gets like a
restart reason I'm
super passionate about every new full
moon every new moon or eclipse or blast
learning about what each one does and
how they affect me because they all
affect me differently and I'm extremely
antastic so a really planet is also a
mercury so I get really affected by
retrograde and also their most of the
time pretty affected by full moon so on
a lead up to a full moon or a new moon
you can expect to feel kind of weird
like you might just be feeling a bit off
or a little bit like it's just this way
you can't really explain the feeling you
can feel a little bit like maybe
frustrated or just a little bit
emotional out of this feeling friends my
my always takes me six tops I feel like
is there like a retrograde is a full
moon coming up or like I'll do the same
to Julia like I'll take so being like
what's going on I feel so whacked out
right now at ninety nine point nine
seven time there is something brewing I
was sort of brewing in the solar system
or something is currently happening
sellers attention but Julia always
writes about all that stuff to her
Facebook pages killer George kind of the
heart truly io Julia so much love for
educating me so much on all this by the
way everyone that I speak about that I
watch or what I read or whatever I'll
links below really great youtuber to
watch is Kelly Rosanna she also talks
about new moons retrogrades and also
those monthly overviews for your cell
phone and they are so freakin spot-on
it's horrifying mom and Julia have sent
me some links and a list of stuff slash
books that they recommend that you guys
should check out so links and below to
how does this knowledge that I gained
from these sources helped me in my life
and helped me grow spiritually I really
feel like you know I explained that
thing of like when you start selling
when there's a full moon coming or
something bad happens and like you're
like what's going on like it's really
weird
Clemmy astrology almost is like a bit of
reassurance that this is a universal
thing that you're a part of something
bigger than just your own individual
issues and that there is reasoning
behind every
thing that happens everything has a
purpose everything has a reason and
astrology really helped kind of defend
that and back that up to be like this is
what's going on which makes me feel like
I'm okay which is really cool it's like
a little support and just explains more
about the world because this world is so
full of unanswered questions and I think
that when you really tap into astrology
you can find a lot of answers about
things and it's dependent upon each
person and what they discover on their
journey but it's just really cool what
I've kind discovered about myself about
people about humanity and about the
universe and I mean it still hasn't
answered me like why am I here like
happens when I die but it definitely
helped me find what is my life's purpose
what is my own individual beings purpose
on this earth which is a very special
thing to kind of find kind of get a
special feeling that your being is
special in its own right and we all have
such an amazing purpose to provide to
the earth and people around us and that
we all have a reason to be here and we
are equally all as important and special
as each other
so it helps me to have a really worldly
universal view and also health inner
remain extremely grounded and the person
that I am and encourages me to ground
myself because as I mentioned some
videos I'm very empathic I'm extremely
affected by other people's energies and
other people's moods and also my
surroundings when I travel what or if
I'm really dizzy or blur and very very
effective so doing grounding techniques
to bring myself back down I like to get
to in my head oh my god it's really
important for me so I know my helps with
a remaining age group human and a caring
human but it also helps me my job
obviously I have hundreds of thousands
of people being like I love you or hate
you or like kind of putting their input
in and so some people can either with
Fame can kind of go the other end and
become extremely ungrounded ungrateful
and lose touch of reality and it lose
touch of themselves whereas that is my
biggest fear to ever come across as
someone that is ungrateful or
just above anyone but so my my thing is
just always remain grounded always
remain grateful with what you have and
also spiritualities kind of helps me
accept the fact that my life path has
gone this way and that I have been
chosen to use my voice on a platform use
my hands use my body use everything that
I have to inspire and help people and
create things that will hopefully help
people you know that's what I'm getting
all like croaky an emotional but that is
what I feel like spiritualities helped
me find a purpose to inspire and help
others we're doing that I can have live
such a fulfilling happy life but
obviously that's my own individual just
seeing that I found as my purpose so the
cool thing about astrology is just kind
of helped me understand people more so
if your sense like and obviously style
times depends but people think that like
if you're also straight up like swallow
a link Aries or a Pisces earlier or
Gemini that you're just that sign we
have you have your Sun Sign your moon
time in your Rising Sun and you are
equally as much all of those three times
as you are you're sometimes so much fun
sign is Leo which is very loud
courageous confident and then my moon
sign is Virgo kind of very organized in
control on to it etc and then my rising
sign is Gemini I would say that my
Gemini side of my quirky sign like I'm
very curious about laughing I get like
my sense of humor from my Gemini side
I'll also leave the link below for how
you can find out your rising moon and
fun time because it'll explain it so
much more about you no one else on
Twitter asked of what are your rituals
that you do and how do you implement
rituals and rituals that I always do is
whenever I move into a new space or if I
go to a new space I will always sage the
room
sage helps clear any past energies that
were there or what spirits or anything
kind of like that but you can also save
yourself I sometimes will just kind of
lie at my stage and just you know
feeling through Cleo just kind of give
yourself a little water if you just hung
out with someone that had a really bad
energy and you're like whoa don't need
that around me in my space you can Sage
full moon new moon and
manifestations I will always sit down
and write my manifestations for the next
like six months or just around that
timing and when it comes to
manifestations it's almost like the law
of attraction you writing down your
biggest dreams your desires and things
you want to manifest into your life what
you would like to change and they scare
me every time I do a manifestation I'll
leave it like six weeks to six months
and then I'll go back to my journal and
read through the manifestations that
I've written and pretty much everything
on the list of things that I've written
down has happened make sure you're
manifesting greatness not anything
negative or anything
spiteful like that shit's not going to
work and I definitely have phases with
crystals and tarot cards and all that
type of stuff which I'll think about
tarot cards and whatnot in another video
too and I also think that what I'm going
to do is run to the Gold Coast on the
weekend and up vigilia live so I kind of
want to maybe do like a little sit-down
chatty video with her about psychic
stuff and clairvoyance II and her own
personal journey with that because she's
been doing it for years and she is
incredible she'll be able to explain
that a lot better than I can just
because I mean I still I'm confident
about my stance on my spirituality and
astrology but I'm also still pretty shy
I talk about my own experiences with
clairvoyance II and psychic things just
because it's very personal to me you
will say is that I definitely do believe
in psychics obviously there is some
better than others it has a very bad
name because it is an extremely touchy
subject and um there's a lot to it it
can be used for so much greatness if
kind of expressed correctly but the
person also has to be ready to receive
the information because no one ever
wants to hear bad news about themselves
or kind of hear about bad things that
might be coming up which you're kind of
exposed to when it comes to clairvoyance
and psychic stuff I will kind of talk
more about that with Julia in another
video I'll definitely do that because I
interesting really happy that I sat down
today I told you guys about this it is
something that I just think I couldn't
keep putting off talking about because
is such a big part of my life and for a
little while I kind of felt like I was
being a bit untruthful that I wasn't
talking about this stuff and I was
because it has had such a huge impact in
the person that I am and in my everyday
life and in the way that I interact with
other people so I'm definitely kind of
working more towards doing that and
constantly doing so I think I just was
very nervous to do it for a bit but I
don't have anything to lose from doing
this and I think it can only help people
you know sort of depends how you want to
take it and I hope you guys learned
something or you just enjoy watching me
sit inside this beautiful plan and talk
either way you so much for watching if
you got all the way to the end so it's
really a long video keep an after the
video I do with Julia and all my other
videos coming up soon don't forget to
follow me on Instagram snapchat Twitter
all that stuff all the links we left
down below so everything I spoke about
I'd love to hear about some of your own
spiritual journeys or your astrological
beliefs or comments on your star sign
and we can all kind of have a chat down
there it's really important and I've
definitely loved it a lot when you guys
