and nighttime routine video what I
usually like to start by doing when I
get home is I just jump on my bed and
dump all my stuff down I just usually
like to plug in my phone so it's
normally dead by this time of the day
then I Slyke to get on to my laptop and
check all my social medias and what's
been going on I always start by putting
on music from my soundcloud then I'll
move on to my YouTube and check my most
recent videos comments and I'll just
reply to some and read through them
after that I'll just check Facebook and
stuff and when I open it here's a cute
photo of mum and I we were taking photos
and stuff and then I'll usually go into
my phone and just check in stee and
check everything else like what everyone
does you know the usual thing check
Twitter first to tweet you guys don't
follow me on Instagram or Twitter my um
my social media tag is just at Katia
Milan then once I've caught up on
everything I close all my laptop and
stuff and head into the kitchen area but
first I thought I'd show you my outfit
I'm wearing these really cute bail pants
from Pinker Boheme my crochet jacket is
from inada my top is thrifted and these
gorgeous jewels are from Dixie store and
I am totally obsessed with them I've
just layered three of the necklaces all
together and they are so cute I wear
them with literally everything and the
top ring is from Dixie and the bottom
ring is from a tree of life and here's a
little close-up of my makeup I sent for
something really natural just to shimmer
tones and
the star and this really nice Brown kind
of lipstick all the makeup is from
covergirl I was trying more one brand
then I took kick off my boots and check
out my really sexy socks
I don't probably wear them just letting
you guys know that ones that I had but
once I've done this I'll just kind of
take off my boots dump them in my closet
am I the only one that dumps all my
shoes on top of each other yeah I don't
know then come out to the kitchen say
hey to mom she's really working hard and
what I like to do is just make myself
some tea and today I was just making
some green tea and then while I let that
boil I like to just get a little like
afternoon snack and lately I've been
obsessed with having dates and I also am
loving dark chocolate covered goji
berries and then pour the tea
honestly Saab says the green tea drink
it's so so much like all throughout the
week every day but once I do that I can
just come and sit and chill on the couch
and have a bit of time to just relax and
then once I'm done with this I'll take
all my stuff back into the kitchen and
then not me just kind of chill around
for a little bit I was checking out my
new tent and kind of arrived the day
before and I was just obsessing over it
I got this kind of cool TV tent from
home camp it was very pricey but totally
worth it and then I was just having a
chat with mum were booking some
accommodation in Sydney and of course
you guys know me I was checking out all
the places on Airbnb and we were just
flicking through and deciding what we
wanted to book and stuff and I don't
know I don't really have anything set
that I always do every afternoon kind of
changes but this is just what was
happening at the time and once I've kind
of moved around doing it nothing at for
long enough I go back into my room and
flop onto my bed and this is what I'm
kind of reminding myself that I should
be going for a workout so what I
normally do is I jump onto my phone
again and check out my pump part pump up
up sorry
I actually am in love with this app it
is such like a positive community of
people sharing their experiences with
weight loss and fitness and a healthy
lifestyle and I get so much motivation
from just scrolling through all the feed
in here and I love it because you can
like customized workouts and you can
pretty much just like fully tailor it to
what suits you and how long you want to
workout for and it's so good because
instead of see-through like a really
good warm-up and shows you all of the
different um different like workouts to
do and like give us a photo on top as
you can see on the screen so I
absolutely love it but moving on with my
routine by now I'm feeling pretty
motivated I'm like yep I'm gonna get
changed and so I just put on my workout
gear and I'm just wearing my Nike Free
Runs and some
pants and this Lana Jean top and then I
gone to the bathroom and as quickly whip
up my hair and get it all out of my face
and then grab my phone and my headphones
and I'll head out the door and just
before I leave I'll start my workout on
pump up and what I also love is I post
little photo and I've just put some
photo of my shoes and workout ready and
off I go I'll just normally go for a
30-minute brisk walk and it's always so
pretty where I live to go walking it's
so nice to see the view and get some
fresh air once I get home I just switch
off my music and then I'll go back to
pop up and I'll log my work out so I can
always go back and check out like what
I've done and share it with everyone
else once of home I dump my phone down
take off all these sweaty gym gear and
I'm heading to the bathroom and I'll
take out all my hair extensions that I
had in from the day I don't wear these
every day I just had them on so swimming
stuff today before I get into the shower
I like to remove all my makeup with some
space wipes and then I take my MD
formulations face wash and wash my face
and then I'll normally have a shower
after I do this I'll use mine Nioxin um
shampoo conditioner which helps my hair
grow longer and thicker and then I'll
just use my Cetaphil and I put this all
over my face then I get change into my
comfort pajamas not stylish at all but
you know it was really cold and then for
dinner what I've been liking to have
lately if I'm too lazy to make anything
is just like a protein shake so here I'm
just making in chocolate wine and I put
ice and blend it all together and yeah
nothing really to it I wish I had like a
fancy dinner tonight to show you guys
this is just what I was having um
now I like to blend it all up and I put
it all in a cup and then once I've done
this I usually take it around to the
counter and I don't know mom and I
pretty chilled we don't really do
anything crazy we just normally sit and
have a chat over that and then I'll come
back into my room and just do some
planning stuff planning videos checking
off my list putting any dates and that
need to be added to my diary
so just later on for a little longer I
start to get really tired and then it's
my bedtime so I just jump onto the
covers and get nice and warm and comfy
and find a good position to land and
then I go to sleep see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
