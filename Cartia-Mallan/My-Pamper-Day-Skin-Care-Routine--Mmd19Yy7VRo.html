running you guys through my pamper
routine video this is on a day at where
I'm like I just need to completely relax
and just give myself a rest if you're
working hard a lot and you're doing
something creative or you're trying to
really be focused in what you're doing I
think it's so important to have a pamper
day I put my treat myself day every once
in a while it really helps you to just
get recharged re-energized Rhian spired
and it's just good to be nice to
yourself and treat yourself well I also
feel like days like this where you can
just sit and reflect and relax it helps
you get really grounded or at so I stay
grounded and just on track with
everything this is a video collaboration
with soakin it's kind of like my pamper
routine / my new skincare routine
because I use pretty much all Suqian
products for my skincare routine and you
guys know I'm
cest with everything sook-yin so
throughout this video I'm going to be
showing you what I do and showing you
how I incorporate their products and
ever found products I love this much so
I'm beyond excited about this video and
I hope you guys enjoy it
so let's just jump straight into this
video they're normally on a pamper day I
will not set an alarm to wake up I'll
just let myself sleep in and wake up
naturally lambs run in bed for a little
bit I love just laying bed and looking
out the window and just completely
relaxing I'll just like scroll on my
phone maybe journal for a little bit
then I'll make my way into the bathroom
and the first thing I love to do I'm
like a relapse days just jump in the
shower
and have a rinse off first product I use
my coffee and coconut energizing body
scrub I love this stuff if you've used
it you'll know that the smell of this is
just so amazing I love sweet smells but
this actually energizes you it's like
having a coffee before you have your
coffee in the morning and it also leaves
my skin feeling really nice and
moisturized
after I scrub it all over my body and
then wash it off after this I really
love to wash my face in the morning with
some kind of sprout because sometimes I
wake up feeling a little bit oily in my
t-zone so I'd love to use my toxifying a
facial scrub this is the super greens
one and this as well smells so good it
makes my skin feel really nice and fresh
and just ready for the day but this is
my pamper day I have not in any rush I
step out of the shower and dry off and
stuff I normally just like to yawn to my
skincare routine
and these are the products I've been
using for the past few weeks I
completely stopped using all my other
products and gave these following these
exact steps Oh solid shot and as you can
see in this video my skin is looking at
super clear and I'm so happy with that
but what I like to do first they go on
with my foaming facial cleanser and just
rub this all over my face get it to foam
up really nicely and then I wash this
off my hands down favorite products I
spread it to my face throughout the day
it's really like refreshing and you can
pretty much spray it on your face
whenever this is the hydrating mist
toner I love this I'll spread it across
my face let it dry for a minute or two
and then I'll go ahead and put the
shoulder moisturizer on that is pretty
much my skincare routine right now what
I do morning and at nighttime sometimes
I'll just do it at nighttime
on days where I'm like having it treat
myself day but going out and getting
coffee and getting something really
yummy to eat so I just quickly got
dressed and then Ricardo came over and
we went to go down to Bondi at for some
breakfast so I always keep my suit in
hand and nail cream right at my little
table here because my hands get super
dry a lot of the time and I get real
they get really painful here and I think
it's just really important to look after
your nails and hands so I always keep
that hand cream Nessman before I leave
the house I always remember to put it on
I think it's the best it makes your
hands nice and soft I just walk straight
out the door and off to get some yummy
yummy food I'm sorry if this makes you
guys really hungry
I actually don't blame you if it does
it's nice to just sometimes like feel
living a really healthy diet and
lifestyle and like you work out and
stuff like I mean even if you don't do
any of those things I recommend you do
but it's just nice sometimes to give
yourself a treat and honestly everything
in moderation everything in balance so
Ricardo and I just shed these two when
we go to coffee and it was just so nice
to be able to not be in a rush and just
to sit by the beach and really relax and
my pamper days I just love to be with
your friends and have a big chat about
what's going on talk about any goals you
have that you want to achieve in the
next coming weeks talk about anything
that's bothering you or anything that
you need to get off your chest I think
point of having a pair today is being
able to connect with yourself as well
and think what do I need to improve on
for the next coming days it's a great
day to reflect so yeah I think having a
friend and some yummy food and coffee to
have those chats is also just perfect
then once I get home this is besides the
pancakes this is my favorite part
I just love laying on this couch and
check my phone I like to just go through
Twitter go through my Instagram just see
what my friends up to have a chat with
some friends catch up on my social
medias I love to read I'm reading this
amazing
the Sun and her flowers it's a poetry
book I also journal this is a great time
for me to like flicked write any
manifestations down write down any video
ideas I might have and to get lots of
thoughts that I have in my head onto
paper it's super therapeutic and it
helps me stay on track and then of
course what is a relaxed day without
some Netflix at the moment I'm watching
knockos series 2 and I'm obsessed with
this I'll either just watch Navajos on
my laptop or I'll put it on my TV on
Apple TV but sometimes I just like to
lounge out either lay on the couch and
watch it or go into my bed and just
chill and watch it also to scroll
through tumblr I'll play a comments on
my youtube you know the drill you guys
know when you just fully in chill-out
mode also normally my like I love doing
this I'll never get the luxury to do
this when I've got a lot of work on I
love having naps on the couch
does anyone else love doing that I just
like to like close my eyes send along
like 20 minutes so I don't fall asleep
for the whole day and just have a quick
power nap I just find it really relaxing
and energizing and as it comes into
afternoon time and the Sun starts to set
I like to uh myself a bath and oh my
bathroom is my favorite because it's
just so cute and you can set it up
really really beautifully
I like to do it's just like a whole heap
of candles run my bath put some bath
salts in and just completely bliss out
once I jump in the bath if I had to wear
my bikinis because don't wanna have
nudity on my channel but oh excuse that
I know it seems a bit weird but filming
purposes my favorite favorite favorite
sukham products that all my friends and
I always use is their face masks I'm
obsessed with doing face masks it just
helps my skin's so much and I love to do
these once a week or twice a week um I
went in with my aunty air pollution oil
balancing face mask and just put this
all over my face every time my friends
come over to my apartment they always
rained my little face mask collection
and we all just sit around here and just
have face masks on and it is the best I
love all their face masks because all of
the products in them a super natural oil
balancing one has bamboo charcoal and
tea willow-herb and it just keeps your
pores clear and like I don't know all
their products are super interesting to
me because when you read them they've
got these amazing natural ingredients
that you would never think to put in
skincare but it just they all work so
well and I just oh when you try them
you'll understand how great they are and
how good they feel on your skin so while
I'm letting the sink in I often read
drink some tea
but once I'm completely blissed-out I
jump out of the bath and then during my
nighttime routine first go in with my
intense firming serums
and put this on before I moisturize and
this is just gonna help my skin
overnight and stay nice and tight and
really fresh I hope this all over my
face and then I'm going with my Holy
Grail this stuff changed my life changed
my skin this is the nourishing and chia
seed oil I love this I alternate between
using their rosehip oil and the chia
seed oil both are incredible chia seed
oil is super rich in omega-3 and six
antioxidants and amino acids it just
feels amazing on your skin and it's so
moisturizing you can also use the rose
hip oil and your hair sometimes I'll put
it in the ends of my hair and it's
really nourishing you can use it on
different parts of your body um chia
seed oil and rose have a great for
scarring then to wrap it all up I love
to moisturize my body my honest favorite
smell is coconut and they have a coconut
and lime and hydrating body lotion so I
get this pump a whole bunch of this all
over and rub it all over my body
this also has rose hip and avocado in it
and it was butchers saying this for over
I'll judge over oil is that jojoba
jojoba oil I'm probably completely
saying it wrong but that is pretty much
everything I do for my pamper routine
all of these products I use every single
day I am so obsessed with them I was
beyond excited about being able to
collaborate with Sue can because I have
used certain products for so long and I
don't think I've ever found the skincare
that I'm literally this obsessed with
you guys know I'll never promote any
products I don't genuinely use myself if
you come to my apartment you will see
they are scattered around everywhere
yeah I encourage you guys to always take
a night
day in a week to just give back to
yourself or the hard work you do all the
time yeah I think it's really important
to also be aware of the products you're
using on your skin and what they're
doing to the environment I love their
kind of motto skin care that doesn't
cost the earth they're really ethically
aware and 100% vegan 100% cruelty free
no sulfates no parabens they're also
100% carbon neutral thank you so much
