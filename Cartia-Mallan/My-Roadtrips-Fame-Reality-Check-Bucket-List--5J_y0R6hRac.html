back to my channel i'm katya milan and
today i'm going to be filming a Q&amp;amp;A
video because i have not done the video
like a proper sit-down with you guys
video in it feels like for us you guys
of instagram just to leave some
questions in the comments and I was
bombarded with questions and I'm just
going to jump straight in and say
answering them start off with one that
was asked a lot just to get it out of
the road how do you find all of these
cool houses that you stand in Byron Bay
and when you go around the place like
where do you find these houses sit on a
B&amp;amp;B in my spare time and look at cool
houses all across the country and I
literally in my head plan little trips
to do so for proving the moon just kind
of planned like that with leave on
Thursday and arrive in Maitland on
Sunday but the rest like the in-between
part everyone kind of left it up to me
to organize so I go and like Google Maps
and fun towns and look up places and
ever be like I kind of follow where the
houses are and then we alter it that way
but everybody has like literally the
coolest houses because people's own
houses that they rent out so it's like
it feels really homely it's so much
better than renting a hotel room and
like I don't know if it was a bigger
prefer ending and fit so many more
people in a house and you just split the
like cost between your group so
hands-down best best website ever for
booking holiday places it's so easy
another question I got a lot a lot is
are you going to splendour this year yes
of course I'm going to Slater that it's
such a dumb question I was so lucky
because my friend Emma's dad is a VIP
because funny because he goes every year
and she got my tickets on the pre pre
sale so we were like sorted she got me
my three-day festival and Carrington
so like I didn't have to go through the
stress of sitting on my five different
laptops trying to like get up tickets I
remember doing that last year with Izzy
in class and the teacher came over and
like tried to shut down my laptop and I
was like look I'm trying to order my
splendor tickets don't get in the way of
me know what was it like meeting your
friends at amplify live it was honestly
incredible and a very eye-opening
experience because I guess as I said in
the end of my amplify book you don't
realize how many people are watching
your videos until you see them old
standing right there in like a large
lump-sum of people and they all coming
over and like some people crying and
you're just like it's like it's an
excitable feeling it's definitely very
rewarding and it's like nice to say that
I guess the work that I put in does
actually help some people and it's
touched some people affected some people
and it's actually reached out there so
um it was awesome to sum it up it was a
great great experience what is your
favorite thing about Bombay um a lot of
people also ask me this like they always
say why is it your favorite place or
like what's so great about Bayern haste
you're always going to go post when I
was little and I never really went to
buyer and I just my parents always would
take me to the Gold Coast and once I
started going to bar there's such a hard
thing to then go back to the Gold Coast
because it really centers around the
people the reason why I love buying the
most is that uh it's just like feel like
the people there like my soul pot
they're just so easygoing and it's like
it's so self expressive it's like you
can be yourself there no one's gonna
judge you like you can wear what you
want and you can just like you know
you've got so many sauces on the street
just singing and dance
in like the main path you've got people
doing like self-expression theater and
just lounging out doing it's nothing you
know it's it's totally the people that
make them what it is besides the
beautiful beaches and the great cafes
and shops and stuff literally meet so
many people environment just from
walking on the street like my friendship
on when we were there she can make such
great friends at one of the buses on the
street and literally start with him like
an hour just talking about their lives
but it's awesome I just the people there
are brilliant and I freaking love ins
how do you stay so positive all the time
and not care about getting hate I am
lucky I guess I don't get too much hate
everybody's staying positive I just I
don't feel like I have time to be
anything but that I don't know how I
could deal with being a negative person
because life is so much more wonderful
when you're like happy honestly like
I've had tough days in like grade 9
where I remember like I had months of
just feeling so sad and slow down one
day I woke up and I was like you know
what it's honestly this is the worst
feeling I don't want to feel like this
and I can determine the way that I feel
I stay positive but I always tell myself
like how lucky I am when I look around
I'm like whatever if I have my head I
have a bed like some people do not have
these luxuries and in a modern world
like if you're watching this video right
now you're probably luckier than
freaking a large sum of people across
the world that you've got a laptop you
gonna probably laying on a bed you're
probably you know in your house under
watching it on your phone and you know
like it's these luxuries that we don't
actually click into think of how blessed
we are to have them because so many
people don't so it's those things that I
look back and I appreciate like I
appreciate where I live and my family
and my friends and
everything good you know the Wardrobe
full of clothes and I've got so many
possibilities in front of me that
anything is possible I can do it as long
as I put my mind to it and this is just
crap that you get told all throughout
your life but no one ever just sits down
and takes the advice so the moment that
I've started taking me advice everyone
was giving me and then I was giving
myself it was like it's so much easier
to be happier than to be sad being sad
is like a full-time job you just you
just have to try and block everything
out of your head it's just so hard I
cannot do and I get stressed easily over
small things because they're
insignificant and superficial and a lot
of it is just stuff that society will
put pressure on you for just blank it
out of your mind don't even think about
it twice and just think if hits the
pan well whatever it'll all eventually
sort itself out like this it's not a big
deal nothing's really a big deal and
when you look at it in a full picture so
that is how I would answer I stay
positive getting really like deep today
with you guys but oh well you choose one
thing to do before you die that is
impossible for you to do right now what
would it be the one biggest thing on my
bucket list is that it's totally
impossible for me to do right now
because I'm on the other side of the
world and I'm not so you feel like it'd
be the right time for me to go now but
there is a festival it's not only a
festival it's more like a how they call
it kind of like a social experiment
it's called Burning Man which is held in
America somewhere I'm not really sure
exactly what pretty much in the middle
of the desert nothing that and it
becomes a colonized like actual place
they call it Black Rock when all these
look where all these people literally
come out into the desert for I think
it's like a week or more of ten days and
live there as if it's just like a city
or a town people come and they bring
artwork and they bring these massive
installation things and Burning Man at
the
there is this massive sculpture of a
wooden man and last year they had a
woman and a man like embraced and they
burn it at the end I don't I don't think
it's possible for me to really
articulate exactly what they do and
stuff but think of like a music festival
times 10 filled living there and there's
crazy people everywhere doing all sorts
of really self expressive things and
it's just it's just like another world
I'll leave a link to a video that I've
watched on it and a lot of people say
when they go there like nothing comes
back unchanged you know your clothes
dirty your souls
touched your minds change your
imagination broadens and it's totally
like a survival thing as well like you
need to bring enough water that will
last you for 10 days in the desert you
need to bring everything thing is it's
really cool cuz it's actually a massive
massive area like it's fully probably as
big as like from here down to the other
side of the city and everyone rides
around on bikes all day I rode with this
massive sandstorms like it's crazy you
just I have to look into it I've sat on
the website for hours and hours trying
to read about everything and I really
get a close enough idea of what it might
be like until you kind of watch videos
and go like that's what everyone says
you never know what it's actually like
until you go
so that was a long story but that is
just the number one thing on my bucket
list is to go to Burning Man and
hopefully do it more than once I would
love to go like a few years
consecutively what is your least
favorite quality in a guy my least
favorite quality and a guy would
probably be someone that isn't up front
and this plays games in some ways I like
it when guys playing hard-to-get like I
don't like them and they're just like
fully up front lights I want you in a
mic because obviously you always want
something that you can't have so I don't
know I just don't like you my guys drag
out situations and I just like upfront
about things nothing pisses me off more
because leaving
I just hate feeling like confused in
like when you're kind of in a thing with
a guy I could when it feels like it's
just one person trying when the other
ones trying to act cool and Bo like you
so that's probably my least favorite
thing in a guy it drives me nuts and
just besides the fact if they like cocky
or judgmental you define yourself as
famous how has such Fame impacted you as
a person today I do not at all consider
myself famous I think it's I think
having like 100k followers on Instagram
would make me famous like there's people
out there that are actually famous like
people in the world no no I think I'm
just you could just say I guess known by
a certain demographic of teenagers and
in like the YouTube world and stuff but
it in saying that having a large
following definitely has impacted my
life and myself as a person learnt a
stack from it definitely it's it's
impacted me most ways positive but some
ways are negative like all lstart the
positives like I can help other people
that makes me beyond happy because I
have like messages I want to kind of get
out they're just wonderful we're having
like this little family of people that I
guess you can like chat with you know
that are there to support you no matter
what and it really brings out the good
in like younger teenagers like showing
how much like the love capacity that
they have because these people are
amazing but then again I guess it does
impact me in ways that I wish it didn't
like you are being judged by a stack of
people so they will take anything that
you do anything that you say they can
twist it they can just jump to
conclusions about who you are as a
person or what you are as a person what
you've done and you know this room
answers everything and you you're
expected to be in a certain mold that
you're molded by the people around you
but I guess that's the one thing with my
youtube show and my Instagram that I'm
not kind of afraid to be like look this
is who I am yeah I don't follow the
rules whatsoever I'm not trying to
appear like a goody two-shoes like I
totally screw up I do things like
I do things that every young teenager
girl dues doc don't I'm learning more
just to not really care if I post it and
if it's like if someone has a problem
with it it's their problem like this
don't really care anymore what people
think of la-di-da
where is the most common places you shop
for clothes I shop for my clothing
literally everywhere in random stores
mainly I try and shop in op shops and
vintage stores you get really cool
one-off start like I got this jacket
from a vintage store when I was in fine
vintage drawers are a bit more expensive
but at least you know you're getting
like genuine one-off clothing and a lot
of you can just mix and match with
different things what is the strangest
place you've met a subscriber oh my god
this strangest place was when I was
explained the last year and we were
walking out of violence ho ho and I was
redrawn clerk not gonna lie I was like
you know all over the place with all my
friends and we're walking out down this
dirt road and I see this girl on the
floor who's like got a bloody nose ha ha
I ran over and I was like oh my god I
can help what happened like she's like
bleeding everywhere and like all this
stuff and all the sudden she lifts up
her head and like there's blood all down
her face and she says oh my god are you
Katya and my heart nearly dropped I was
like oh oh my god this is scary hello
and I was just like all over the place
saying also the random stuff and I was
like trying to help this girl and she
was like pulling away this place and it
was just really crazy experience all my
friends in there and my guy friends were
just like laughing like what is going on
so that was a really kind of weird place
to me to subscribe off did you get
scared by playing toilets when you flush
them oh my god when I was little I was
horrified what I would do I put the
toilet seat down and I'd quickly press
the button stand back and like lock my
ears and like squit my eyes was freaked
out so dumb but it's like so loud my
piercings
was true it's like the last who inspires
you to be yourself and do what you love
I have one friend that always kind of
inspired me the most my friend is he
like she knows this I told her there's
so many times that she does inspire me
because she is really freaky just does
stuff and I look at her and I'm just
like yeah it's like amazing and creative
and you don't care all what people think
and you're not fussed about so much
stuff for a while that she was like my
music I was like she just kept me going
and I was like you're just she's an
awesome girl I will say like oh but I
guess she was one person another person
that inspired me was my auntie who
passed away a few years ago she was like
my best friend when I was younger like I
wouldn't hang out with girls for my
school I'd go to Auntie Wendy's house on
the weekend and hang out with her she
was like she treated me like an adult
like she knew that I was a bit like an
old soul kind of thing I guess she could
say and she treated me with all this
respect and like we had a mature
conversations and we had fun together
she was such a strong woman like she
didn't take from anyone
she put her point to put her foot down
and stuff so I guess growing up with
such a inspiring woman like her I guess
that's kind of followed through me and
it's not she's always sitting with me
and around me and just like she's
pushing me to do it too um then my two
main influences but things inspire me
are I watch a lot of videos online
I watched documentaries I try and get a
world view I guess so when I um look at
things and I look at other people in
their stories it is so inspiring to me
and I'm like yeah like if someone else
can do it I can do it so um yeah
everything around me inspires me but
that's my main my main things how come
you're moving to Sydney next year will
you miss your friends back in Brisbane
I'm actually moving to Sydney in
December if everything goes well and we
find a house that we want to buy and one
of the aim is to kind of like we're
looking at houses now to move into like
during this year and then like kind of
fly back and forth and whatnot but by
the end of the year that's my aim is
just to be there full-time I'm moving
there because Brisbane is just such a
small place I feel like the sooner I can
get out the sooner like the momentum or
to start not start just progressing in
my life instead of just being stuck in
one place and getting too comfortable I
guess with Brisbane and you know because
it's convenient I know the people here I
know the places here but I feel like
it's gonna be interesting to put myself
out of my comfort zone and just see what
comes from that um it's more challenging
and bit more fun there's new people in
new places
I'm all about exploring so that's my
goal and Sydney is a beautiful place why
do I want to move the most is because
there's the city and the beach in like
approximate areas kind of thing so yeah
and then weather's good there too so
it's normally sunny I want to move there
to keep pursuing my like fashion
blogging and stuff and try and get more
into the entertainment industry with
acting and with and representing
anything to do with all of that stuff
that's really what I'm into and that's
my main girl so we'll just see how it
goes it's my were just jumping straight
in and like prayed for the best so that
is all the questions I have time to
answer my cameras flashing with a
running out of battery thing so I'm
gonna speed this up and wrap it up now I
hope I answer some questions that were
taking over in your mind that you guys
wanted to know please leave in the
comments any future videos that you guys
want to see like proper sit-down videos
whether it's makeup advice cheat or like
anything any videos you want to see
leave it in the comments and I'll get
around to doing them in the meantime I
hope you guys have a wonderful week and
you are doing well and have fun whatever
else and whatnot
and that's everything thank you all so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
