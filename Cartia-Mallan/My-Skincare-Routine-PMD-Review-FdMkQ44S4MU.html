great mood to film and I thought I'm
finally going to film my skincare
routine because you guys have asked me
for that so many times and I'm always
like yeah yeah film it this weekend
always keep putting it off now I'm
finally doing it I think I've kind of
come to a point where I've like nailed
my skincare routine it's been the same
for a while now I'm pretty confident
with the products that I'm using they've
been working really well for me I'm
going to tell you what products I use
and just some other tips that are really
helpful to keeping your skin clear and
um just yeah other random things that
you might not have considered that
helped out a lot first I'm gonna start
by telling you how I sort of cleared up
my skin and it's just some other ways
that you can clear your skin with diet
and exercise and all that sort of stuff
so this is the sort of stuff that your
mum tells you that you probably hear on
a daily basis it's all this stuff it's
drink water have a healthy diet light
exercise green tea green tea number
three for the green tea I notice if I've
been eating really really badly in a
week like if I've been eating a lot of
sugary foods or fatty foods my skin
starts to get oily and it gets little
pimples all over the place and it's just
not nice I hate it and it just it just
makes me feel really gross or together
my whole body feels gross when I start
eating really crappy junk food over my
first tip if you wanted to clear up your
skin or to maintain good skin is just
you don't have to eat like celery sticks
it's just about you know balancing up
where you eat I do not have a perfect
diet like I am NOT like gods and then
eat salad a sort of thing but if I do
notice that I've had like a rough week
where I've just been like you know
splurging a little bit which is fine you
can do that then I just kind of rein it
in next week and just try and like drink
more water because that does hydrate
your skin water is obviously so helpful
for lots of different things but um yeah
that's one thing and I'll just if I have
had a bad week with eating wise and
my skin's all broken out then I drink a
lot of green tea like on a daily no
matter what but I kind of amp that up a
bit because all the antioxidants in
green tea helps for everything it's good
for your body it's good for it's good
for weight loss it's good for skin it's
just good for everything it balances out
your body so much since I started
drinking green tea my skin's improved my
energy levels have kind of improved like
it just is an all-round sort of Savior
kind of thing I don't even know you hear
everyone talk about green tea like that
but I can definitely say it's like my
holy grail all sort of helpful for
everything exercise wise um just moving
your body you're working up a sweat
that'll cleanse all of your pores and
one night if you're doing everything
right so what I normally like to do is I
just try and go for like a 30-minute
walk or like a little bit of a job if
I'm feeling extra fitly three times a
week so just three afternoons I go for a
quick like thirty minute run walk and
the walks not like a slow walk I go to
walk with like like a brisk walk or
whatever they call it like I don't just
to get your heart rate up you know it's
just that whole thing once again of
clean eating um exercise drinking lots
of water it just keeps your body in
balance and then once your body's in
balance then it really helps your skin
so then you've got the added help of
having really good skin care products
which can then help clear your skin or
treat any problem spots that you may
have it was in the last year or two
years ago that my mom put me onto the
face wash that she was using it is this
skin care line it's got MD formulations
this is literally my Holy Grail skincare
um
cleanser and scrub nothing works better
for me personally like I just oh my god
I'm I can't live without it
this is literally I don't know why I
haven't spoken about these earlier
because I've been using them for so long
okay so first of all I start talking
about the face cleanser fresh one like
mom just bought me at the other day so
I'm like e this is the cleanser and it's
so great because it's a massive bottle
it lasts for ages okay so the reason why
I think this
um cleanser works so well is because it
contains salicylic acid no the whole
science was hot behind salicylic acid I
just know that it's really good for like
clearing your skin it is quite strong so
if you do have sensitive skin then I
wouldn't recommend kind of going towards
those kind of harsh and ones with all
the Celtic salicylic acid and um there's
another one I can't remember its name
I'm not sure but okay so it doesn't even
matter what's in it so as I was saying I
don't really know all the scientific
stuff about um salicylic acid but this
face wash has literally saved my skin it
just clears it up instantly um I don't
know what else to say but MD
formulations facial cleanser that's that
one do if I feels like my skin's getting
really bad or if it's just feeling gross
I'll sometimes do this maybe every the
second day or once a week I'll use the
face scrub it's a face and body scrub so
I sometimes use it on like my back and
shoulders but I mainly use it for my
face and this stuff is incredible like
overnight it works so well leave all the
information for what the products are in
the description box if you do want to go
an order this stuff I'm pretty sure my
mum buys these of strawberry net I'll
ask her because it is a little bit
pricey but I think you can get it for
cheaper off strawberry net I'll suss it
out and I'll get all in the description
box for y'all though
best facial cleansers ever I just oh my
god I can't even okay so the next thing
I use is Cetaphil oily skin cleanser for
oily and acne prone skin now I have this
jumbo one because this is also another
one of my Holy Grail skin um washer
cleanser alongside my MD formulations
cleanser and scrub I like to use this
just to help get off any excess makeup
or just if I don't have that with me
this just saves my shower times I use
this or the MD one this one is great I
use this not only for my face but for my
whole body
with me since my hair is so long
constantly when I wash it i put you know
oils and products and it all of the oils
kind of sink into my back because the
hair is wet and it's like on my back and
it's long so I sometimes I get a break
after it's called like back knee that's
what people call it it's so gross like I
hate it nothing is worse so what I do is
I use my Cetaphil and I just get like a
scrubber or like exfoliating gloves and
just like rub it on my back and this
just clears it really well it kind of
keeps my skin nice and just oil free so
that is my cleansers now I don't use a
toner I used to and I didn't really
notice that it did anything for my skin
so now I just use after I cleanse I just
use a moisturizer so I used the UM
Suqian facial moisturizer
I like this moisturizer so much is
because it doesn't leave my skin feeling
really oily some moisturizers I hate
because it's so oil-based and whenever I
moisturize my skin eyes feel so it just
breaks it out even more because it just
makes it early and shiny and gross this
one is really great it's just kind of an
all-around good moisturizer I don't have
like one hologram moisturizer but this
is one I've been using for a few months
now and I've been really liking it so
moisturizing is definitely really
important keeps your skin hydrated and
looking nice and fresh and especially if
you're wearing makeup when you've got
moisturized skin it helps off the makeup
go on so much easier so that's why often
I'll put on moisturizer before I put on
my primer and then put on my foundation
because then it all just glides on
really nicely and gives a really nice
finish so yes that thought which for my
Proactiv I'm refining mask I just use it
as a spot treatment so I used Proactiv
years ago my mom I got my skin is slow
by tiny Proactiv so she was like hey
when it got Proactiv like it was good
used it for a bit whatever didn't
continue using it but I kept this the
refining mask which has lost me for
forever and I'm so sad now because it's
literally run out but it looks like
almost run out but this is incredible
it's just like this really thick white
paste
you can't I see it and what I do is I
just uses spot treatments oh I forgot
like a pimple somewhere I'll just put it
on at nighttime just spot it on and then
I sleep with it overnight and it kind of
just like sucks out everything like just
like that I mean no it just leaves your
skin nice um you can also use it as a
full face mask which you leave on for
like ten minutes and that works a trick
as well so yeah I do that every once in
a while when I feels when my skin's
getting bad again so yeah that's that oh
my gosh yes bring him in this is my
brother Harrison this is poppy Lee just
got his name's Pablo don't I get in the
frame don't say hi get down wargs you
look kind of funny then say hi hi what's
up hi oh yeah he just got a puppy and we
call he called him but I actually named
him we put him Pablo and he's so cute
look he keeps falling asleep oh he's got
like the brightest blue eyes and he's
just so adorable
oh and shall I know I popped out Pablo
just live I'm so upset
anyway it's back to skincare I just want
to make a puppy video now um no but okay
back to the serious stuff it's pretty
much it for my skincare products um I
love all of those products so much there
is like I've tried it so many things
like I literally have a massive box in
my room of just products at Ivy's tried
overtime that just haven't worked my
skin and these are the ones that work
I'm not at all saying that they're
definitely a hundred percent going to
work for your skin because you know
everyone's skin is diff but I think what
it comes down to is experimenting with
different product and really getting to
know what sort of skin type you have to
then find products which will suit your
skin the best alongside using these
products what I've started to use lately
which is honestly like
changed my life dramatic statement but
it's so not even an overstatement
it's like possibly an understatement
we'll set this product the PMD is a
personal microderm which is like
originates from microdermabrasion
treatments that you can get done now I
will send this a few months ago and I've
been testing it out a few times you
watch what it does it is it promotes
cell renewal so um it's sort of like an
exfoliation thing I don't even know how
to explain how it works but pretty much
it's this little wand looking thing and
it has like you know your on/off button
and you just plug it into the wall and
it's got like a little novel head and
it's like sort of the sandpapery feeling
stuff like an exfoliator and what you do
is you turn it on and you just run it
down along your face and you just keep
doing little lines like this and what it
does is it takes all of the dead skin
cells off your face and allows for new
skin cells to cut and fully clear your
skin now I've been using this for a few
weeks now to try and to clear my pores I
have really bad big pores near my nose
I've been really self-conscious about
for ages I hate having to put so much
makeup on them because I just feel like
it just blocks that I've been using this
to help trying to clear it up and it's
just been working a treat pretty much
I'm getting actual microdermabrasion
treatment done can be really expensive
and it's just you know just one of those
things I don't know I've never had it
done I've never really thought about it
but this sort of open my eyes up to what
it sort of is this is probably better
than getting the actual treatment done
it's a much cheaper way it's handy you
can do it from home whenever you want to
fully like keep my skin perfectly clear
I use this in conjunction with my other
stuff so I'll knowledge it every two
weeks just to give my skin a full
reboost and what it does is since it's
taking away those skin those dead skin
cells it allows your face to open up
more so the products can go in easier
and absorb but never know if I'm making
it's kind of hard to explain if you do
want to find out more about that product
their website has a lot of information
other videos that give a really in-depth
kind of explanation to it as I said I
was serviced to try and if I did like it
I could tell you guys about it but it's
pretty much become um like a major skip
skip a major step in my skincare routine
I didn't even know there was such a
thing and it's just great I'm so in love
with it and you can also get a little
nozzle and it doesn't really work for
your face you can use it on your back on
your legs and your feet on any way that
you may have like problem airings it
just helps with so many different things
results show like instantly I remember
the first time I used it just afterwards
my skin was glowing and it felt so soft
like a baby's bum or something if you do
want to check out that the PMD I've got
an amazing 25% of coupon code for my
subscribers I'll leave the coupon code
download and it's down below oh my god
okay no speciate down below and I'll
leave their website I highly recommend
that and I mean that honestly not just
because I was sent the product but I've
actually been using it and it's so great
yeah do go and check out their website
it's in my description box go and read
some more about it if you're interested
and yeah along with all the other
