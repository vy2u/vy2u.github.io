planning to do we're kind of planning a
little trip to America together I'm
super excited to do that I know I've
been so lucky with my filming since I've
been in Sydney it's just been so much of
a rush and I just always get there that
I forget to film and I know there's
probably just like clips and it's like
what are you actually doing that doesn't
make any sense but pretty much today and
more and when I go to Melbourne I'm
going to try and film as much as I
possibly can because I know you guys

roaming around getting like a little
shots of like random cafes and coffee
and food but yeah whoo artwork on the
street yeah so I'll try film more so a
very rare occasion is actually sunny in
Melbourne today and it looks really nice
and we're very happy about this we're so
pleased it's very odd that Sun actually
I know like every single day that I've
been here so far it's been like very
grey and just yeah grab that guy girl
impressive okay you jump a gate sorry
but this is our clothing collection
we've just laid out with bonds like very
earthy tones white Queens and green
stuff got a little setup here and first
we're going to shoot just really pretty
Chuck a hockey dress it's so nice we're
all done shootin now we need to go get
some food I'm really excited for this
the shots before them but some film
footage you're just the greatest joy
we've best you ever
staring at a different food a fun face
looks like all wrapped up by the knife
you can see that it's like two two
little hands like pinkie promise
and it's the other hand supposed to be
my mom turned I was supposed to get like
a little K I like a little initial K on
one of the arms it just wouldn't fit but
I'll probably ask that in the next time
and yeah it didn't hurt as much as I
thought it would but I'm so excited I'm
so happy with it
Little Miss over here encouraged me to
get it looks so good
so Gabi's gone to work and I just had
her play since my last night here and
I'm movin and I think I just had to
speak about this I've had like such an
amazing past few days and I think it's
so weird how little Gabi left for work
like we just both kind of like come and
go and love each other so much like it's
like we both kind of teach each other a
lot about who we are and where we're
going and how we can grow and accept her
Anna and just I think it's really
amazing how people like that they can
really inspire you and really make you
want to change for the better and like
really push you to do what you like
should be doing Tapani it's really
amazing how they just can kind of like
fall into your life and you don't really
expect that that would happen like I met
Gabi I'm not that long though we did a
shoot together and we just like
instantly clicked and I'm just cruising
at her house like I own the
place
but yeah I'm I just had to say I really
appreciate people like Gabi that are
just so genuine and lovely and
warm-hearted and caring and giving and
just so talented so creative and just
amazingly raw and real it doesn't like I
think it's always kind of hard being in
the industry and I'm in I get a lot of
people that are just super fake and want
you to be around them for like really
ridiculous and dumb reasonings and I
just think it's really nice when you can
find a little gem amongst the other
rocks not to be really corny but I just
had to say and also to give you guys a
little tattoo update I've taken off the
bandage so I'm gonna edit a fun video
now and yeah
I don't want to go home looking at you
in five ways that can be amazing yes
yeah no we read</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
