blade and we're going to be doing a
question meant with you guys because as
you know I have a diamond planet like
I'm studying like a new fitness regime
we getting into new routines working out
more intensively so not only pursuing
cardio but also working like all areas
of my body muscles and whatnot which I
don't normally do and so yeah I just
find it was black and we're doing what
do you like how would you kind of a mix
of weights and cardio but essentially
run her through similar programs the one
that I run which is called six weeks or
16 so taking it through that in
conjunction with the nutrition and then
other elements of health and mindset as
well whereas the lentils or the
questions that I want so at the moment
I've got like three weeks before I go
and away in LA so I'm like trying to get
it all anymore then and when I come back
we're going to continue I guess working
I don't have the entire six weeks but
yeah as mentioned you don't have a
program it is all done so you guys
should check it out okay I'm just going
to answer some questions that you asked
on Twitter go with sport yes so somehow
is bored eating a thing and I was like
yeah how to pretend it is and the thing
with bored eating is one at present six
human needs but one of them is variety
right so we need right in our life and
quite often people will look at variety
in terms of food or if they get bored
use food as an option when it comes to
boredom you want to think that other
things that like to get you up about the
way I do Anu I support it all the time
like I just if I was like sitting around
at home like I just don't like it
something's not really happening so yeah
I want to like do something so I always
bought it but instead now I like to
mommy's always like go drink water but
that never like did it to me I was like
that's why I got into green tea you like
it but it ever like bought anything I
just have like speaking of the green tea
and I was like okay I'm good now but you
have to think like am i eating because
I'm actually hungry oh I might just like
snacking for like
point of smacking that okay so what will
often happen of it for my people bored
eating will come at night so what you
just said perfect in terms of being
conscious device being aware more
whether you're actually hungry like
eating stomach grumbling and it's also
like normally I was reading levels
valuable websites for weight loss if
you're like getting into funny for that
then you should grab it earlier like
also get into a habit of employed eating
later at night because I know that you
can also write down for sometimes only
dislike editing tool really land on my
channel a little bit peckish like going
to bed earlier has a think really
however and also splitters obviously yes
huge yes okay tweeted on and if they
motivate keep fit and healthy awesome so
a good question
when it comes to motivation one of the
things you guys want to realize is that
motivation comes and goes what you might
see but bikini body and that might be
your initial inspirational what you guys
need to understand is that motivation
will come and go come on improvement but
first likely in our case it might be the
you know the motivations there now and
then it might fly to some point I'll see
her initial motivation is Hawaii and
that's fine now but you want to go from
motivation into habits yes like if you
can get those habits flowing that we'll
talk yeah gimme get feeling on track and
it becomes like not it's not addictive
in a bad way addictive and go a link
you'll you get used to your body feeling
really great when you get into a routine
of working out and eating healthy and I
think that's for me how I actually stay
motivated was I like I've mentioned so
many videos before as like my whole
thing is I like to wake up and feel
energized and like fresh and like ready
to go for the day so I think that's what
keeps you motivated is do I want to feel
good yes and doing what my body to be
healthy so I think yeah it's getting to
happen in a routine and very clear book
you why Aries is very clever because
what what she does well is understanding
the dollar which most people don't like
you can she's actually deconstructing
like the way life works out
yes because it wasn't easy at the start
like I'm not saying that I'm not saying
like oh yeah I'm just going to be
working out every day and I like I've
been doing this journey for like quite a
while and it's just building up those I
don't even know what you'd call them but
just building up and I was dropping the
excuses I guess I'm just like getting to
the chase of like do I want to so good
yeah always when I say to myself very
good that the other thing to remember
god is that you know you might have your
Instagram followers and you know there
might be some sport models or whatever
that you have follow just because of
what they post and it's all the healthy
stuff don't sleep that they don't have
moments within are motivated as well so
everyone's going through that same don't
be so upset or like not feeling as
motivated as you may want to be in a
moment as well because as plate said it
comes and goes so it's just accepting
hate on each thing but also don't be
afraid to push yourself and also don't
like go to public you have to find a
balance like if it's all different for
each person i John's on that like
topless mmm this is open I want to get a
flat stomach men help a girl out I feel
ugly so that without complicating things
there's two things that you want to
think when it comes to fat loss
okay so nutrition is around 70 to 75
percent of your results online right
exercise is 25 maybe 30 percent if you
want to start something tomorrow and you
want to start making inroads tomorrow
the first thing you would address is
your nutrition so the other thing to
consider that and a lot of people at the
other end of Gallaudet besides a lot but
they don't get the result you can tap
out that out run a bad diet right then
you can you know do your 10k is each day
and still struggle with that flat
stomach because you have an interesting
nutrition I have class summers yet but I
definitely think with white if you're
like looking at flat stomach and white
looking timing I think it's balancing
the right exercise with the diet like
that was the thing for me that's what
also energizes you more when you're not
putting crappy oils and processed fats
and all that stuff into your body if
eating healthy is not
like something so it's not like you
don't have to make it land like you can
actually make things like taste good and
you have to get creative and experiment
with the taste that you already like how
often should you need to speed up your
metabolism so judge that's a guys this
here is that that one everyone kind of
so different things yeah and more often
you eat the more it will speed your
metabolism up you've got to be careful
though so the one thing that let people
down when they eat more often is they're
eating more all right
so if you think about your portion size
and you might have three big plates or
you might have six smaller plates the
problem for a lot of people is yes
eating plan yeah absolutely
eating five or six times a day is great
and it maintains your blood sugar levels
and it maintains your energy and it will
speed up your metabolism but you need to
be wary of of the sizes so if you if
you're gone from eating three times a
day and you've got great I can explore
six times a day awesome the fighting
needs to reduce the side that side look
look to anywhere between four and six
times days a pretty good number yeah and
I guess if you mill present maybe it
might be easy to experience without
wanting to do it that way personally for
me I find eating just three problem
meals a day is best and like snack on
like some nice maybe on containing more
green what I'd rather take right so good
question what you make it work at and at
the moment what we do is free weight
sessions a week and to Tanya I thought
five sessions a week and we're into the
end of week one and it's been pretty
overwhelming because it's different
watching with you ste and if they after
the first like when I went in just to do
like basic stuff just like all this what
what a plan push-ups well no it was a
lunging like me now to tell me like I
haven't used those muscles and so long
because my basic workout used to be like
so you deploy minutes of cardio plus
like some squats and an ab workout and
like a fart workout just like from like
an a YouTube video so when I was
engaging the new muscles and less
what the hell are like afternoon weights
like my arms here also but I mean like
the more you do that the more your
muscles work up to and staff but the
other thing to consider with that is no
matter how fit or arms that you are if
you guys start a different self training
which we found out like you're going to
be sore and you think it's good like for
if people were to try to fledge mr
Turner and they just wanted to do things
from home you think it's best to do that
variety like this weights and the cardio
like equally balanced oh yeah so I got
when it comes to fat loss what you want
to think about is how can I get my best
bang for my buck and what I mean by that
and how can I keep my metabolic rate
range after the workout right you've got
what's called an after burn effect where
we might burn 400 calories in a workout
that's nothing compared to what can be
burnt Arthur right so we did not never
know about she fits that some my workout
to probably random but they're quite
well thought through in that we trying
to use the biggest muscle so we use
their legs a lot we is about the right
we'll use chest muscles a lot as opposed
to too many like tricep kickbacks right
we could there's big muscles and they
create the biggest art of burn effect so
she's burning fat when she's sleeping
Thank You president and happy your arse
inspection what we surprised to find out
those actually unhealthy you guys know
like I have something like they know I
love other colors oh so Mitchell used to
be I am addicted but I've completely
chilled it out but when I was I was like
posting on Instagram or eating avocados
it's not chat like everyone knew that I
loved it what started putting me
articles about how full of fat they were
and I was like like and then just about
balancing fats and also do you want to
elaborate on what this is like and
that's still a confusing thing for a lot
of people like fat sugar should I be
having it you know like the obsession
that is bad and absolutely kept that is
more calorie dense than meet others but
it's not necessarily bad if you guys are
looking for the quickest trip into
in fact if you sugar it will drop why or
body very quickly yes sir what about a
doctor the devil in it here so someone
asked what push you to start training
with the trainer and I've been it kind
of on like a weight loss training for
three or so years now and I have kind of
experimented with trainers at the start
and then just went on my own journey
within a lot of the journey 3 was the
diet side so I think now that I've kind
of like I'm really with my diet like I
do not eat any processes I don't crave
any more like my body out of that whole
zone with that I really wanted to chain
it because with my weight loss that kind
of like I was a plaintiff like sort of
like plateaus because I've done it for
so long and I was doing the same
exercises and the cardio wasn't really
working to me and I don't know that much
about what exercises I should be doing
select start burning afterwards the more
muscle toning Lola so that's what pushed
me to do in also having a trainer like
you have to do it like you've got to
show up like it's a two-person thing you
know like you don't wanna let the other
person down and also like it's
motivating to have someone there bit
like actually knows what they're talking
about like I'm not a professional at all
this stuff and that motivated me and I
also wanted to start talking more about
health and fitness on my channels
because you guys kind of always asked me
about it like you can easily like to
refine your calories and drop weight off
but it doesn't stay off and I think
there's a really bad mindset to get in
when you thought having a negative
relationship with food and then so much
for like young teenagers like everyone
kind of has their especially girl but
some girls have their struggle with
their relationship with food but it's
just finding like a healthy relationship
with it and not going too much pressure
on yourself to chop it quick like a
longer funfetti winter as I always said
that throughout my journey and um yeah
it depends on your slides realistically
and what don't get the stage they are
there and I mean in all working no
matter what size you are if you're
losing more than a kilo and a half awake
you're probably doing something on an am
show too
and unfortunately you know good
girlfriends the new train on beautiful
loser startup on a kind of exciting
month I think she's going to have
different approach those shows
potentially had negative impact on some
people because they have such rapid
weight loss you've got to forget they're
training for five six hours a day on a
heavily restricted diet as well and I
first time when I was a lot bigger
weight came up quite a lot faster at the
start because I think you just got so
much excess then it burns off quickly
looks like oh my God thank again I
haven't missed it no I
how long does each workout love and how
do you best maximize that time one of
the things when it comes to exercising
our session for 45 minutes
I bet though that if I was to go all gun
down on it we could kill her in about
benefit they met and in the nicest
possible way what what you just think
about is intensity not duration alright
so if you guys are time for whatever
reason you might be you know you might
have lots on during the day you can
still do lots of stuff in 10 to 15
minutes I mean our 45 minutes and three
and 45 minutes five times the data five
times a week but you don't need that
much as long as it's intense
that's the with intensity is that going
to be able to be uncomfortable for you
guys if you can hold a conversation with
your partner or your training partner or
you go off in boy whatever it is you're
probably not working at the intensity we
want to burn serious fat like you a die
okay if we start talking about does what
about it
apply my conversation she does another
thing that you think about is that like
it's really burning and hurting like you
have to remember your body can handle so
much more than you think and I always
like the last estimate I will sign on
like what are you supposed to me in 45
minutes I get probably Holograms like 10
minutes like it goes pop and the rest of
your day is done like it's a tiny bit of
your stay that is going to be over and
done with focus when it's going to
really make a big impact on the way your
body looks and how you feel and yeah
it's supposed to be when people like I
need to go
without flex two hours long if Isis wind
up what you're doing and okay so that is
all the questions we entering today and
then the discussion side we're going to
film some I think I know we just we'll
just look I'm going to film this whole
kind of journey process we can maybe do
some workout stuff it's like explain
some of the workouts we do or talk about
nutrition or vlog some of the sessions
I'll figure it out but I'll keep you
guys posted on how it all goes and yeah
don't forget to go and check out like
social medias and all the stuff that he
does I will leave them a link below and
yeah love it yeah
don't you see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
