everyone okay so this is so strange for
me because I honestly haven't found a
video like this in so so long now you're
watching this and is probably Christmas
so first of all Merry Christmas and I
hope people had a really nice day so far
today I'm just sitting down I'm on the
Gold Coast I'm at Rachelle's apartment
and I'm an idiot I was supposed to film
this video and have it up a lot earlier
than now but I didn't have any time to
film this before I left Sydney so I'm
doing it now and pretty much this is
just going to be a newsie get ready with
me make up an outfit video um house of C
be set me some really beautiful kind of
like party dresses which is super
different I never ever normally wear
stuff like this I was like excited to
kind of create a look that's super
different for me to ever do I'm not made
festivals every single New Year's and I
will be able to festival this year so
I'm not going to be getting dressed up
like this at all but it might be some
inspiration if you're like in a big city
and you want to go out you want to like
glammed up then this is perfect for that
so yeah this dress kind of looks really
Christmassy so this is good job I mean
that this was uploaded on Christmas Day
so yeah I'm just going to be chatting
with you guys while I put on some makeup
I have no idea what makeup I'm going to
do I'm just going to do it I was
authentic to how I would do it if this
is what I was wearing and if I was
wearing like a big kind of dressy party
type of thing so let's just jump
straight into it and honestly this feels
like a winter dress like it is hot right
I could switch this view right now I'm
literally looking at the beach and it's
a really hot sunny day so this is like a
lot so I'm just going to try and smash
this out real quick so I'm gonna zoom
you guys in
slowly so as I said I'm not sure what
I'm going to do but I'm just going to be
using the Christmas and New York to face
palette and it's just got like some nice
neutral colors and some other fun colors
in there but I'm just going to be
keeping it simple sorry if the quality
isn't too good I'm using just my
vlogging camera is using the color
tiramisu this light brown to cut out my
crease and to use as like a transition
shade I'm starting with the eyes just
because if there's any fallout I find it
easier just to do this and then you can
clean it all up with foundation
afterwards
this is so weird for me putting on all
this makeup I have not done this hit so
long and I just got my eyelashes redone
so it's perfect timing I honestly love
getting my lashes done they just make
every look looks so much more complete
and you have to put on as much eye
makeup so I'm just gonna keep it rather
simple and they're ever going in with
that color and also a little bit of this
darker Brown just to kind of darken it
up more I'm going to be focusing this on
the outer corners and just kind of
blending it around like this it comes to
makeup looks I honestly just keep it
really simple just like the same kind of
thing just Browns and a crease and then
shimmer on the lid I always like to kind
of smoke up my eyes I think since I've
got such dark features it just brings
more attention to like the eye color
again since this dress has gold
detailing I'm going to go in with this
color cold praline and it is just a gold
shade I'm just going to pop this all
over the lid
and then I always just kind of dragged a
little bit into the inner crease just so
it kind of adds a little more definition
a little more glam so you can ski see
that goal well you pretty much build up
this shade to have gold you want it to
look I always just keep going back
because no one comes off easily so if it
conflicted right now you guys know I
love winged eyeliner but I'm not sure
whether I should put on some but my
lashes on think what I'll do is I'll
just go on with some pencil brown
eyeliner first and see if that darkens
enough and then I felt like it needs
more like I'm a smoky look to it then
we'll go on with the eyeliner
so I just kind of do that super mostly
but now I'm just going to take that
really dark brown color called I'm and
mop up on a little pencil eyeshadow
brush you know further smoke it up by
adding a quite a dark layer and putting
some mascara on my bottom lash line
okay so super spin vault that is it for
the eyes I'm going to move on to my face
now in zoom you guys back out okay nope
that's it
after the face I'm just taking my flat
top kabuki from Sigma and also my
favorite foundation which is the hello
flawless oxygen Wow this is from benefit
of their mixing toasted beige and beige
together toasted beige by itself is like
way too 10 for my face like too much
foundation and I want it to be too cakey
so I just put half a pump of each on I
look at myself right now if like this is
like a Christmas like a glam Christmas
makeup huh it's a good one for either
that's really good that thing I've
loaded on like Christmas Day but you
know okay I'll Drive down my foundation
I just go my concealer and I'm just
putting on the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer in the color medium light
neutral
that's all done I'm just going to be
taking my mac prolongwear powder and my
brush as you can see I've used this to
death this is lasted me for so long it
is my go-to I love this product and I
want to make sure I Pat this on under my
eyes it's going to help that concealer
stay on then the rest I just kind of
swipe a light amount over because this
is the main area that you want to kind
of keep intact onto the brows with my
favorite brow product and this is the
goof proof brow pencil by benefit guys
I'm obsessed with Benefit Cosmetics like
half of my makeup is just benefit to my
brows I just pretty much follow my brow
shape they're really overgrown at the
moment I need to go get them done but I
just kind of pluck them out also hope
you're not looking at too shabby
it is so hot wearing this right now this
is like a sweat central this dress is so
thick as such a well-made dress material
so thick and warm but like not for an
Australian summer like I if I was
in New York right now and it was snowing
and I was about to go to a big news
everybody this would be perfect but I'm
not suited for the season and taking my
Mac give me Sun and my my Real
Techniques blush brush this is my holy
grails as well this brush is the only
thing I'll ever use for bronzer is the
best so weird to think that it's like
Christmas tomorrow this year has gone by
so quickly I know everyone always says
that like every year but this year has
been so extreme like I've been out of
school for a whole year now just the
strangest thing to me my blush I'm
taking my new favorite combo and this is
just these little toothpaste blushes I
mix them both together and so the first
one is the color baby love and then the
second one is more of a like pink and
this is crazy and love quite a bit of
that and then I add like one little like
spot of the really bright pink one and
it just makes like for a really nice
blush time highlighter I'm going to be
taking gold deposit by Mac and also
mecca's don't know what this is called
but yeah I put this one more aimed on my
cheekbones and then I put the gold one
like above it I don't know I just I mix
them I don't know if you're supposed to
do that but that's just what I do I love
this Mecca highlighter it is possibly my
favorite one I used to always use Mac
soft and gentle but this is definitely
this is nice I think this is more of
like a nice pearly tone the gold deposit
just kind of sweep the cross on the side
really lightly and just adds more of a
gold gold shimmer to it I'll put on like
a brown kind of tone for us this is just
me paste melted in the colored chocolate
honey I'll say this looks like I'll just
play around with some colors
don't mind that at all I think I'll
leave it with this color and then just
add a little bit I'm more of a gloss
type of person so I think I'll add the
Too Faced lip injection lip plumper and
I have a love-hate relationship with
this up it hurts so bad when you first
put it on flick the first five minutes
and then you get used to it on your lips
but it works it makes your lips look
nice and juicy yeah so it's going to add
like a layer of this just to make it
glossy this is the final makeup look we
the makeup is honestly so simple it's
what I normally would do if I was going
out somewhere but as I said you can
easily flim this like if you can do the
eyeliner you can add more lashes
whatever you kind of want to do but I
just want to show you what I would
probably do if I was going out so now
I'm going to show you guys to outfit
options so the first one is obviously
this one and I have another little black
dress it is a lot more simple so it
depends if you're kind of a person that
likes to get really dressed up you like
to keep it more on the simple side both
of these outfits are from house of
Seabee so thank you to them for sending
these over so that is everything for

Christmas and I hope you have a fun New
Year's and make sure you stay safe look

not sure with video wise I was posting
three times a week for December I'm
going to try and keep out for a little
bit in January but I think it'll
