showing you how to achieve this really a
full on a glam makeup look I actually
wore this makeup to my semi-formal which
was last night I went and got my makeup
done at Mac and I loved the way that the
makeup artist did the makeup so I tried
to recreate sort of what she did and the
kind of look that I went for I'll also
show you how I started my hair and I
tried to also copy the hairstyles that
did my hair it's really nowhere near as
good as how the lady did it it was like
perfect yesterday and I'll also be
showing you an outfit the outfit that I
wore we worn to a really special event
it can be worn um night out it's really
glammed up it's something really
different with the diamond choker I
think it makes it really classy and
elegant you can even just take off the
diamond choker and wear the dress and
the big heels and maybe some other
jewelry and throw it out clubbing really
feminine and sexy kind of look so I love
it it's so nice and yeah so if you want
to see how I achieved this makeup look
and if you also want to see how I do my
hair and my outfit then please keep
watching I know this looks funny and
sort of like I've been punched in one
eye but I just had to mention before I
start showing it how to put on the
eyeshadow I'm just going to be applying
a lip balm to hydrate my lips because we
are putting on a red lipstick and we
don't want to have any like dry cracky
lips first of all I'm taking my soft
ochre Paint Pot by Mac and now I'm just
putting this on my eyelids to prime them
to make sure that the eyeshadow stays on
all day
then with my two-faced smokey eyes
palette I'm taking Firefly and just
patting this onto the lid to make sure
that I get the most amount of color out
of the shadow then using this color
cloves I'm just going to be taking this
on the same brush and lightly blending
this into my crease then with my pencil
brush I'm taking up and smoke this
darker brown color and blending this
into the crease and also just along the
lash line to darken up the look a little
bit and I'm just taking this fluffier
brush and blending out the colors a
little bit so there's no I'm harsh lines
then taking a white eye shadow I'm going
to be applying this to the inner parts
of my eyelid and also on the center to
brighten up the look altogether and then
also with a more shimmery eye shadow I'm
taking this jewel kit from Stila I'm
going to be applying this to the same
place to give a little bit of highlight
to the look then with an even bigger
fluffier brush I'm blending all the
shadow out once again to make sure
there's no harsh lines taking a
concealer brush and my stick concealer
I'm going to be dabbing this on the
brush and then lightly applying it just
under my eyebrow to highlight the brow
bone
then on top of the concealer I'm
applying a more shimmery white color I'm
taking the pencil brush again and the
color up and smoke again and just
applying this to my lower lash line with
my felt tip liquid liner I'm going to be
winging out my eyeliner in a nice kind
of really big winged look just so that
it looks kind of elegant and then hangs
on the scar just to prep my eyelashes
before I put on my false eyelashes and
also putting it on my bottom lashes too
then with these Mac eye lashes I am
going to be sticking these on and I do
have a video for this so I will leave it
in the downbar I'm obsessed with these
Mac lashes they're incredible then I'm
just going through the lashes to blend
it all together with my mascara again
now that we've finished the eyes I'm
taking my makeup remover and wiping all
the excess shadow that may have dropped
down below just off my face so that we
can start fresh for all the facial
products first I'm taking my still a
one-step correct just to correct all my
skin tone and to prime my face for the
foundation my foundation I'm taking my
makeup rubber HD foundation now this I
think is a little bit late for my skin
tone since I've got a spray tan on but
well let's just see how we go I am
taking this with my sigma black Buki
brush and I'm just lightly buffing this
into into the skin to make sure that I
don't have any lines anywhere I love
this foundation specifically for this
look because I know I'll be taking lots
of photos on the night so I don't want
my face to appear white if I'm getting a
photo with flash so this is why this
foundation is great it keeps your face
all one color and it has a really great
flawless finish which I love
and taking my mac prolongwear concealer
I'm going to be applying this under my
eyes to get rid of those bags and to
also give a really nice highlight to the
look
you
then I'm just taking my big hourglass
foundation brush to blend these two
colors in together then I'm setting my
concealer so it doesn't move with a
translucent powder at the rest of my
face to make sure the foundation stays
on all night and just to give a nice
modified look I'm taking my Mac pressed
powder and just applying this with my
Real Techniques face brush for my
eyebrows I'm just doing my usual step
just filling them in with a Smashbox
eyebrow powder to give a nice to find
look
once I've done this I just like to go
back and freshen up that highlight under
the brow again to warm up my face and
define my cheekbones
I'm taking my casino nose bronzer and
I'm just applying this to my cheekbones
and the temples of my head and also I
want to slim down my face a little bit
so I'm going to be applying a bit
underneath my jawline then with my new
Mac highlighter soft and gentle yes I
finally got it everyone tends to be
raving about it and yes it's incredible
I'm applying this highlighter just above
where I put that bronzer on the highest
points of my cheekbones I am in love
with this highlighter it gives a really
gorgeous kind of glowy look and I'm also
just applying a little bit to my Cupid's
bow you can just see how lovely and
natural that highlight looks now I just
want something really subtle for blush
because I'm already going to be having a
really bright lip so just a title and
together I'm applying a tiny bit of
peachy-keen by Mac to my cheeks now for
the most important part the lips I'm
just going to be dabbing off that lip
balm that we applied earlier and taking
the star of the look the gorgeous Ruby
woo by Mac I'm obsessed with this
lipstick I can't believe I only just got
it now it's crazy I'm just
methylene dove dabbing this on giving a
like kind of rough outline of my lips
then what I'm going to be doing is later
on taking my lip liner and fixing up all
the lines all together I find this is
the easiest way to do it because red
lipstick can be quite a pain sometimes
so this is what I found to be the
easiest method now to keep all of the
makeup on all night I'm taking my
all-nighter Urban Decay setting spray
and just setting this over and letting
it dry
this look I'm going to be parting my
hair into like a slightly off middle
part kind of thing
and if I'm just brushing out my hair and
then spraying my heat protectant spray
I'm going to be parting my hair in two
sections to curl it up now I do have a
video as well on how I curl my hair so
if you don't know how to do this then I
will leave the link in the downbar now
that my hair and makeup is all done
let's move on to my outfit
