excited for about Hawaii is that I know
that I was like so in love the blue on
it I love like the palm trees and just
the layout of it like all the mountains
my universe is really really special and
the fact that Elvis's like favorite
place and I love Elvis they're just so
many times like me in Hawaii like
coconut go like it just seems right so
I'm just excited to see it and
experience it and like I feel like
something crazy is going to happen

saying it regularly something is really
magical and marshal above yeah I'm
excited just to go and be there what are
some of your goals and aspirations for

kicking goals and so I'm really just
determined if you to step up my work
ethic and I'm so proud of myself already
for doing that it's really gotten my ish
machine together um in terms of like so
many more being more proactive with my
time when it comes to work really taking
advantage of these opportunities I have
like I did my part of year last year
I've done all that I think now it's time
to really focus on growing myself and
growing my platform I really like my
show Realty other fasting I keep getting
my fitness better and working on my bod
and just getting it more fit and toned
get my booty - yeah like it's a girly
things you know um I also want to travel
more meet more of you guys and I also
really want to start my own business
I've had some really amazing ideas for a
little time now for some products that I
want to start creating like my own store
my own brand and it's not going to be
like much racing it's going to be useful
you must talk about it but I'm really
sorry about developing all that once I'm
home from Hawaii I have a huge
sketchbook that I've been filling with
inflows ideas for ages now so it's
something that I've wanted to do for a
really long time and comment below what
you guys think I'm going to be
maintained my main goals this year and
also just to meet more amazing
like-minded people
I feel like that will happen I always
meet amazing like minded people
so bring it on who else is going to come
into my life welcome what programs you
edit your video is on Final Cut Pro rich
childhood memory favorite song my memory
is we used to go to a beach house which
is on South Kjellberg Island it was like
a really
secluded little islands where only a few
houses were on it we were one of the sub
houses on the island so we like felt
like little island family that was
always there I literally didn't rub my
bikes around the island and then we'd
like sit in the back of these views to
go to the beach it was just so fun it
was just like he's running around like
no shoes on there nothing just like
endless days like in the ocean and the
pool and just all times I get so
disgusting anything about so fast
and one thing about moving to Sydney
best thing um so many good point energy
here I love it so much more of like a
grind energy leg is much more fee the
Sun what's going on has so many
different sorts of people and events and
activities and there's ISA city like I
love I just love how I feel um and the
watch thing the only bad thing about
Sydney is just like it takes a little
longer to get places like I have to
leave earlier and I'm like so I'm sowing
organized when it comes to that I mean
normally lights a lot itself but traffic
can be bad but you know what I can get
used to it like everywhere I had this
person home what's amazing about life
off two-disc you believe in aliens or
something similar totally believe in
aliens zones all I mean like it's such a
tiny speck in ah like a huge solar
system the whole entire universe
compared to like everything else and it
would be completely naive I feel if
people just believe that we were the
only species in the entire solar system
like how is that even possible and then
yet life after death or even like who
freaking knows what really happens I
definitely believe in ghosts I've had
like ghosts experiencing myself so I
believe that there's an afterlife
I believe in spirits but I'm not exactly
sure who knows to really know it's so
exciting I like I mean hiding that I'm
excited to die like no I mean like I
love living but like how cool like when
when we find out what happens like I
wonder if you actually find that when
you die
or maybe you just dive you never know
and who knows oh my god I don't know God
what you see yeah like something you
guys conversing you're like holy
where do you see yourself in five years
time I feel like all the living overseas
somewhat I love a child but I definitely
think in five years when I'm 80 90
plants like around 23 years old
I probably live in those things yeah
that'd be amazing like a big green one
i I can never really stay still for too
long so definitely be traveling
definitely still see myself doing
creative job luckily I'll be doing
acting stuff and I'll be more of like an
entrepreneur with my brand
cuz it's doing well and it's creating
awesome content and maybe I'll be in
love I definitely will not have children
by then who knows I just hope I'm having
a good time with some good people how do
you stay positive and motivated number
one question I get asked the most make
it short and sweet I always look on the
bright side of things really respect
some things I'm grateful for and I also
really work hard at staying motivated
impulsive so I write in a general a line
I reflect a lot I call to people about
reflection a lot I talk about my
feelings
I also underlined my feelings in a
positive national dozens way I just try
and this life properly and I trying to
live it seriously and confidently
because why not you know I like there's
no reason not to so I'm just kind of
like I just do my thing you know the
best I can so maybe three why don't you
I need you bother
hey husband time people estimate without
I know it has you come with a Sydney
when all the New York jumped on my whole
body vibrating back bending you
everything
do you have any stretch marks or floors
like that do you mind them of course I
have stretch marks I've walked quite a
bit away over the past two years so I've
stretched my old legs around my foods on
my stomach on my legs like I dunno my
gonna oh like they're so natural and
fine like who cares it's like a little
mop on his skin you can't changes so no
point hating it you know how does it
make you feel when people tell you they
look up to with their role model is it
one of the most like insanely humbling
things to be told and like it's sort of
overwhelming to and people say that to
me like if you've ever met me in person
you like makes me a longer black or even
if you just turn your nose but I get
really charged up really easily so I
just like it's just like wow like even
now this is like it's so much and it's
like any slow blips that people can
connect with me in such a strong way
that it changes their lives you know I'm
available camp to me is that person that
that it gives some sort of inspiration
mlsp a simply very humbling and
yeah it drives me to be better do better
and continue doing what I'm doing what
do you look for in a hot nah
what I look for in guys is just people
that I truly connect with someone that
to motivate me and inspire me and think
I just like get on board with what I'm
doing and understand that I'm going to
be forever changing and growing and like
my job makes it really hard for me to
have genuine relationships with boys
because some people get really
overwhelmed by the taluk world but yeah
I definitely am really into creative
boys guys that are like in creative
industries like where they like
magicians like still make out the
tumbler file artist like anything
creative is just like such a turn-on to
me also guys that have succession guys
that smell good oh my god
someone want to see my type and guys has
changed so I might just assistant in 3
so strictly like Superboy longhand I'm
like way more interested in the
connection that I have with someone and
obviously the cousin gets up strong
enough your attraction to the person
that can just completely increase its
what's on the inside that cancer
obviously if you're beautiful man really
helpful I look for guys with beautiful
eyes like we're the brown or blue or say
just have nice eyes I like literally
died because I was on the new President
of the United States
I could rant about this for hours on end
but pretty much
I hate Donald Trump with a
passion and I'm still my employment at
the fact that he is president I planning
am I was out why and how do you keep
your skin so clear I'm very lucky I do
have extremely clear skin but I think
it's really reflective of my diet I
don't continue furnace oil I don't eat
processed junk food and
I'm plant-based diet I drink a lot of
water I drink a lot of green tea I
exercise and I'm mentally I am pumping
concluded energy into my body so I think
holistically that stuff is important
really onto my skin cowlick I wash my
face every day I use a moisturizer or an
oil that has like rose hips or chia seed
oil in it I think oil is a really great
feel safe and inflection I always wear
sunscreen on my face in the plan let's
take off my makeup correctly I'm really
on to it so yeah so all about my opinion
anyways that is all I'm going to be
talking about if you guys enjoyed me
just like through the guys sitting on my
bed in my pajamas my makeup hair pulled
up like two chops and let me know and I
can make the sustain certainly a lot
easier than putting a whole bunch of
makeup on my face and then City done
talking women it feels like you guys are
here with me and on anyways if you did
