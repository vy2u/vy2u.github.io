showing you guys how to get this really
perfect kind of cutesy date night look I
think because what I kind of put it as
it's a really simple makeup look with
the focus being on the eyelashes nice
and big and really fluttering last time
I did a whole one branded video you guys
seem to really like it so here I am
again with my one branded video and
today the brand is covergirl and the
focus is on their new product which is
the bloom mascara it's so good I've been
using it for a while now testing it out
and it actually makes your lashes so
massive guys will see how I use it in
this tutorial and someone yesterday was
like Earring false lashes and I was like
no the new mascara is just treating you
really well today
excuse my voice I'm so sick and it just
like I was sick and then I got better
and I'm singing and I'm like really if
you guys wanna see how I got this little
date night makeup look then please keep
watching I'm out with my face I'm taking
my covergirl concealer I'm just putting
this underneath my eyes and on any
problem areas and then I'll be going in
with my Sigma tapered kabuki brush and
blending this in and then with my
covergirl foundation I'm buffing this
all over my face and my face looks so
white from the light but in person it's
not that bad and then with some
translucent powder I'm just setting this
foundation all over my skin
then I'll be going ahead and just doing
my usual steps for brows and bronzer I'm
just filling in my eyebrows and then
I'll be bronzing up my face a little bit
in my cheekbone area and also along my
temples because I was looking at quite
white at the time then just be taking
this really pretty peachy blush quad and
putting this right to the apples of my
cheeks to warm up my face a bit and then
with my new blue eye shadow quad which
is a part of the new bloom collection
I'm taking the number two which is
really gorgeous kind of purpley taupe
color it's kind of shimmery and pretty I
don't know how it explained the color
but I love it it's so gorgeous and I'm
keeping it simple with just one shade
and then with my blending brush I'll
just be going in and blending this up
into my crease to give it a really
effortless smoky look then to help open
up my eyes mom taking the covergirl in
kit Brown crayon pencil and putting this
under my lash line because I feel like
it helps my eyes a pair a bit larger and
brightens them and then with the star of
the show the full lash bloom mascara I'm
taking this and I'm applying it all over
my lashes and I love this because it has
petal shaped bristles like on the brush
of it and it's designed to evenly coat
the lash from root to tip and the
formula is so great it's made with all
natural beeswax and it allows you to
build volume without kind of setting
them aside too hard before you can put
on layers and stuff and it comes in very
black and very black waterproof and you
can get this at Priceline and as you can
see I just like to coat my lashes over
and over again and then I applied on my
bottom lashes and I think it's just
about putting layers and layers I guess
to create that massive lash appearance
which
and then lipstick I'm taking 309
sweetheart lipstick and lightly putting
this kind of frosty of pink color all
over my lips just really lightly and
then I'm taking this other covergirl
lipstick which reminds me of like a lip
balm it's really buttery and nice I love
it and I'm putting this over my lips
it's more of a rose pink color and I
just think it's super romantic and so
cute for a date night so here's a close
up of the makeup look now you guys
probably understand why I'm in love with
the blue mascara it literally makes your
lashes look so amazingly massive I hope

and leave any comments down below for
future video requests and you know
