camera and film this cuz kind of big
deal what's going on and Ronnie's here
she's helping me because I'm packing and
moving I don't know how to explain it
it's like what I could something that
I'd like have to sit down for ages and
talk about kind of a long story
I'm posted a public video in a little
while and this is because some stuff has
gone down it's very sad
pretty much my house is a two-story
house there is upstairs it's three
bedroom and then downstairs
there is a two-bedroom sphere it is like
separate from this house pretty much
once some of my friends moved out of
this house the real estate agency was
like well like lease it out so it's a
separate property and just put randoms
in there I was like cool whatever
so they put some people in downstairs
and I never met them because I was like
we'd always just miss each other and
stuff and I would be overseas or
traveling anyway so I went to New York
when they kind of moved in and that was
all good lalala and then we get home and
one night I had some friends over and we
got a noise complaint that night even
though we liked it it wasn't even bad we
literally like we're playing Elvis and
singing along until like 9 o'clock
anyways
all of our neighbors were so angry
because the people downstairs had been
partying here swearing a lot just
yelling and was just being really really
gross and I guess people didn't realize
we were like two separate properties
long story short we all got evicted
because of the people downstairs the
owner was pretty much just like no like
everyone needs to get out this is like
getting ridiculous and like times and
because the neighbors were just like
super over it so yeah when it first
happens Sophie and I were pretty
distraught because I guess it's kind of
hard being like giving two weeks notice
just like move out and like find
somewhere to live and like pick up your
life somewhere else or something and
it's peak time in Byron it's so
expensive to find anywhere and so hard
to find a property so yeah we were kind
of just like what the hell are we
supposed to do and I kind of took it as
my opportunity it was like a push to be
like okay well this is the time to move
to Sydney like I feel ready to move
there now and stuff but I guess like
it's just a bit gnarly because it's like
I mean I wish I could like be moving
when I decide I want to move and like
I'm ready but instead I have to take
stuff that happens like this as a good
push um I think it happened for a good
weird reason I think I need to be there
so instead of kind of just like getting
upset about it I'm just going to take it
in my stride and pack my stuff and move
and I'm actually so excited to move to
Sydney I was supposed to move there and
if last year's love you guys know and I
came to mine for like five months then I
end up staying for longer so now getting
back on track because my management's
there I have heaps of friends that live
there
I love Sydney --xs it's like Beach and
City I'm just gonna like it vlog this
process and show you guys the house
because I never got to fill my room to
our or house to us or now you can kind
of see it while it's in a total mess
of being pierced apart it's very very
sad but the new Sydney place she'll be
fun I actually don't have a place yet
I'm just packing up I need to be out by
Friday it is Tuesday right now so it's
really hectic but yeah whatever whatever
my room does my big like open windows
and I have like curtains and you like
look out it's my garden and my palm
trees this is my backyard
my little hammock and that's the window
to my room and then we have this hole
sitting area you saw a big table out
here I always have friends over and this
couch is just full of clothes and then
somebody so this is like the house right
and my room is kind of like separate to
the house it's just in here and it's
such a mess right now but this is my
room it's so cute half the stuffs been
taken down off the walls and all my
hanging racks on in here I'm so stupid I
should have filmed this before I moved
everything out but I had hanging racks
all here and there's all these plants in
here and all that now it's just a lot of
mess everywhere and you guys kind of get
the point and I love this waking up and
like looking out to that
I think I definitely underestimated like
how upset I would be about leaving he'll
the more I pack I kind of think like how
much this place is really help me grow
and everything I've learned handle so
just like I can't help but be like angry
and a bit upset about just the way that
like we kind of got kicked out you're
kicked out pretty unfairly
and just kind of sucks it's hard like
when stuff like this happens cuz it's
just so unfair but there's not really
much you can do besides just pack up and
get moving with the next venture and
it's just hard man like if
anyone ever tells you moving is easy it
is not there's so much chickens that you
don't realize how much stuff you have
until you're packing it all into boxes
yeah I'm trying not to like be a little
sick about it but it is it's sad like
I'm leaving all of my friends here
really abruptly like I haven't told
anyone I'm going yet and like I don't
really know what to do I don't even have
somewhere in Sydney yet like I'm just
kind of going it's stressful and I am
excited but it is just like so stressful
and then I've got like youtube as well
so I just thought that's why I'd film it
so you guys could see the process
hi hello I look freaking crazy huh
this is my room some remains today I
moved everything out so the house is
empty I know I didn't really feel much
of the moving process there was lots of
tantrums lots of Tears
some happy moments some just crazy
moments I just kind of didn't film it
because it all happened really really
really quickly so yeah it's been a very
strange past few days the bathroom is
kind of all empty all of our plants gone
I just got to clear up this lost things
this room because all I have left is
literally this stuff that I'll be taking
my car to Sydney kitchen
everything's gone landrum everything's
gone someone's coming to pick up that to
buy it
everything is disappeared in the house
the reason why everything's out already
we actually had two weeks notice so it's
only been like a week but the only did
the removalist could come was today so I
had to get everything out and so I'm
just going to be living out of my
suitcases in that room and Pleakley on
the couch I'm just gonna wing it again
tonight I'm just going out and partying
same as tomorrow night for my last
weekend here telling some friends around
so this is really weird I'm just sitting
on this mattress I've just been cleaning
out this whole house look at this look
how empty it is and it's just like I'm
just like in it this is like this is the
end of like this like I'm being so
dramatic Bob farm was the first place I
moved out by myself and I came here on a
sole purpose to like push myself out of
my comfort zone to learn more about
myself to like have fun meet new people
and like I've just everything's like
it's stuck like Oklahoma back to me
now's like I'm cleaning up and stuff and
just I can't believe I'm actually moving
it doesn't feel real yet but I'm just
like reflecting on all the incredible
memories I've had here in like a
I've had the best year of my life living
here and like obviously there's been so
many ups and downs but like I just still
feels like home like it doesn't feel
spooky being here like this and like
it's just I don't even know it's just so
weird because I have no idea where I'm
going like I'm literally going to
Brisbane for a few days tomorrow and
then I'm coming back here for one night
on Thursday night but those I'm Friday
night I think and then I'm just like
driving to Sydney and I don't have a
unit to live in yet I don't know when
I'm going to find a unit it could be
like in a week or a few days or a month
or two months like I just don't know
anything so it's kind of exciting
because this is my whole life has just
been completely shaken up in a way that
I did not expect at all for it to happen
too but it can also like stress me out
because I'm like what am I gonna do like
I don't know anyways this afternoon was
really really nice just being with
everyone and last night was really fun
we went to go into a party and say
goodbye to all my friends and yeah
just about to start my first ever big
solo drive by myself to Sydney and just
leaving by now and I'm first going to
drive six hours two days of the nines go
for swim go fun motel or something and
um yeah oh my god I'm sorry I'm so
nervous I don't even know how to drive
more than two hours but we're just gonna
we're and I'm going to document it all
you guys let's do this
and the drive PQ so I've just gotten to
coffs harbour I'm stopping to get some
lunch I'm starting to get really tired
and oh my god my maps on the way coming
here told me I was going the wrong way
so I quickly did like a huge u-turn on
the highway and then apparently it
wasn't right way one of my pot plants in
the back has smashed I'm so angry but
I'm really hungry so let's go eat
so I finally finished my six-hour drive
and I am currently in Port Macquarie I
just stopped in here booked a little
motel which is actually most beautiful
Motel is right on the water here check
this out I've got a whole balcony and
it's so nice I'm going to watch the
sunset over here I probably could have
kept driving for longer but I kind of
want to like enjoy this until I just
went down to the beach then I read a
little bit and then I just went down to
the grocery store and got some some
hummus and some strawberries and some
crackers and some bananas and stuff just
because I'm so keen just like chill out
watch a movie and just relax and I
didn't wanna have to like go on get food
um yeah so tomorrow morning to get up
early and drive to Sydney administrates
Emmys place and park my car there
because Cher's parking outside of a
house it's too hard to do it to at least
play something because there's literally
no parking was when I crashed in the
night and then on Saturday morning I am
going to be hunting for units
and if I told you guys but I was there
looking for units yesterday I flew down
with mum to look at some and it was like
just nothing was right so I was like I
just have to drive down ASAP so I can be
there to go to all the inspections that
come up with stuff that comes online and
um just got to find the right one I know
what's coming but it's very frustrating
I'm the flat back home yesterday I was
just like I'm gonna cry close it it
sucks like feeling like in limbo like
being literally homeless but I'm also
having so much fun with it I'm like yeah
I'm freaking out but like it we may
as well have fun when we go down but
like yours chilling enjoying myself and
um yeah the drive tomorrow should be
fine it should go past like really quick
it's not too bad today was pretty easy
as long as I just like keep stopping off
and stuff and yeah morning everyone I've
just woken up it is 6:30 a.m.
I'm just gonna lay in bed for a little
bit longer and wake up more read my book
for a little bit and then we're gonna go
grab a coffee
walk down on the beach and just have a
little stroll and then I'm going to get
my car and start driving if it gets too
late cuz you'll have another I think
it's like five or six hours to Sydney
and they slip so well last night because
I wasn't sleeping very well before that
but I said so so well last night I'm
just feeling so like so so positive and
very grounded which is really weird for
me because in the past few months I've
been feeling really I'd wake up and just
feel but really out of and not so
grounded where I was but like I'm in the
middle of nowhere right now in some
hotel and I feel really grounded so it's
really really nice and I'm just trying
to keep positive about the next few days
about finding if I want to live um I'm
just trying to really manifest it and
put it out there because like right now
I'm kind of at the point where like I've
got nothing else better to do so that
normally works the best anyways so yeah
it's gonna be a really beautiful day
today I just finished reading but cold
just kids by Patti Smith and then I'm on
to this book called The Alchemist um oh
here's a little card that Nicole gave me
yesterday morning we went for breakfast
and Bayern before I started driving and
Nicole gave me this and so sweet the
Melbourne I bought this book and I gave
it to Nicole to read while I was
finishing just kids and then we just had
like a little book swap honestly so not
like me oh I can't read like I never
ever normally just like pick up books
and read I struggle really really bad
with reading them and keeping up with
reading them but I'm just like randomly
now I'm like I want to read I love it
because I think it will help a lot with
like my writing stuff and so it's just
nice to get off line a little more that
got a lot nicer to read before I go to
bed so I'll let you guys know how this
book is I start writing it but you
should definitely read um just kids by
Patti Smith I literally could not put it
down it was incredible okay I just went
and picked up a coffee and now I'm on
the road again
and it's only four hours in Sydney so
that's good and I don't know if I'm even
in focus or he didn't see me right now
it is paramount my camera and the view
finders like a flip to the side once I
can't even see but I'm just going to
talk anyways want to spoke about the
importance of machine yourself into
situations II don't feel extremely
comfortable with it so witching your
self out of your comfort zone like why
should we do that why is it beneficial
etc most of my strongest points of
growth in my life so far have been have
come from situations of discomfort from
situations where I've been like like
really like Chrissy about it and I
planned on to avoid finding comics do it
do it push through this and then it will
reward you in some way I feel like when
you have to go through a lesson or a
hard period of time you gain some of
knowledge
gain life lessons that can be then put
into other stars it makes you so much
stronger it also proves yourself how
much your people up whoa Sydney to me is
going to be like that next step up into
my create into myself
I'm just kind of like really enjoying
this like push and enjoying this road
trip so much I woke up this morning and
I was just feeding on so happy i
FaceTime yeah I was like look at my cute
motel I'm going to coffee and just hello
looked out at the Bay Area and this
drive is just beautiful is good to
Sydney yes oh my god whenever I got off
the highway and got into like Sydney air

literally such a mission I took about
five different wrong turns for my GPS
like kept rerouting and anyways

my cars with overheating times a million
and I'm gonna get some aside suicide
right lucky gonna be great plugging down
classic straight to it okay so as you
