today I'm going to be filming a really
casual chitchat get ready with me video
because I haven't done one of these in a
forever and today I've got a lot that I
want to kind of talk about so I thought
what better a kind of video to do than
one of these makeups gonna be really
chilled nothing dramatic just kind of
like my everyday I'm going out for lunch
after this so something I don't know not
dramatic and excuse me if I seem like
I'm grumpy or a little bit like I'm just
dead I've just been flat out this
weekend it's been a long week of school
driving me crazy
you know how it is sometimes hey guys
I'm gonna start out with my origins
original skin cream I've been putting
this on every morning and every night
it's really random I don't know because
lately I've been kind of getting nervous
about my pores are just huge bull
stories recently my face has been really
dull and lost its kind of glowy look to
it and my pores if you actually see in
person I should have quite large pores
thumb right on my kind of cheeks here
and I just I hate it cuz if it'll be
makeup just looks gross and then I found
this cream it's got this really nice
products in it that literally like when
you apply it it like blurs your skin so
it kind of covers pores and it gives you
back this really nice glow so I've been
using it for a few weeks and I've been
loving it what I actually love about
this product is it smells freakin
amazing it smells like a like when
you're gonna push walking you can kind
of smell all the different types of
trees and like leaves and stuff it
smells just like that it is so nice it
has a ingredient called a hint some of
the back willow herb which is I think
what gives you better glow and then I'm
not sure how and I fit like below just
getting but I mean person when you put
it on it literally wears your skin it
looks like you just put like airbrush
effect over your face once I work that
sort of my face I'll be putting on my
makeup forever primer this is the new
range of primers
okay this was at $55 for this tiny tiny
little primer but I must say every
single dollar was worth I find it really
does help with makeup application and
keeping your foundation on for so much
longer it just grips to it I don't
really want to make it like a makeup
tutorial so I'm just going to do my
makeup how I would and I'll list the
products that I use sample look lately I
have been going through this like phase
about school because I'm in grade 12 now
and it's my last year and I'm just kind
of finding it really hard to like find
motivation to do my work and want to do
it all because it's so but I don't know
if I'm really a person that thinks this
but the stuff that I like to study is
just so pointless to me and like what I
want to do when I finish I just and it's
like everyone puts so much pressure on
it it's like you've got to do this and
like this is important for this thing
for that what they like is they don't
have a program for people like myself
and I know that so many other people
that have interest in other things that
aren't academic like it's so hard to try
and like don't totally get I would like
I want to finish I want to say that I
did it like 12 years and whatnot at
school it's important blah blah blah but
it's just I don't know it's just lightly
I've just been really try it's like it's
been difficult for me to find motivation
because there's so much all this stuff
you know when you just have it all in
your head you're like ready to go and
you just want to do it and I'm just like
I feel like I'm being held back from
doing or achieving things that I could
be doing in this year anyways I just
have to try and get over it and just
suck it up and just pump out one more
year and then next year is just going to
be crazy busy with doing lots of stuff
but I cannot express to you how excited
I am to graduate all you're asking um
about my hair cuz everyone's like oh my
god car you got
um I did get a haircut but my hair's
actually always been this length I just
wear hair extensions so um I know it's a
little bit confusing because in some
photos and stuff I've got really long
hair some photos got really short hair
lately I've just been kind of really
really I'm trying hard to get my hair
healthy again and finally it's growing
and it's starting to look a little bit
healthier the ends are getting a lot
better just because when I permanently
had hair extensions in like proper ones
that were taped into my head it just
ruined my hair so much and I wasn't
looking after it it was heat damaged and
just so bad okay so this guy has texted
me and you know when someone doesn't
speak to you for ages and when they text
you in just like other end it's like you
know they want something from you I
nothing annoys me more this is what I
was just such as I actually I just
prefer to film this I was kind of
thinking in my head all this stuff that
I wanted to say um in such a rant mode
like I just want to let everything out
it's really hard because around the
Brisbane area like the people I hang out
with will hang out with sometimes like
people in my grade and the grater bulbs
and stop it everyone's really old
closely compact everyone knows
everything about each other because
everyone just loves to gossip and talk
about everything and I'm so not into
that I don't like that whole group
everyone needs to know everything about
everyone it's just I find it ridiculous
like it's just so petty and it's like
there must be better stuff to speak
about then you know who's getting with
what guy or who did this who has that
like it's just man nothing just annoys
me last night I went to this party and
like everyone was there and stuff and
then we went to nothing afterwards and I
was just copping it from so many people
just like I'd done so many lovely people
that I hadn't seen in a while that was
came up to me and we're being really
nice about my YouTube like Oh
congratulations that you're doing really
well because I've grown up I've grown up
with these people like I've known them
years and obviously you drift with
people sometimes and stuff so I hadn't
seen these if you're these girls and
aiders that was so lovely and then you
just have the other people who it's like
you knew them when you were in front
like in middle school high school
younger and it's just this like still
giving me a hard time about everything
I'm like what have I ever done like to
you or anything like it's just it's this
thing of people following local social
if it's looked as like if people think
it's cool to like do some people doing
stuff that's different on you you know
like it's like oh boy the crown will
just agree with it I don't know I don't
know if it's making any sense but I just
I can't stand the image here today that
it's kind of around like these social
groups and you know it's like okay we're
all growing up like holding and this
stuff and just being really Petty and
immature it's just like what's the point
in it mm-hmm nice meme all because most
of these people older than me as well
I'm like grow up like can we just not be
two years old like oh sorry I'm not I'm
not a fan of complaining or ranting but
that is just since I woke up I was like
no so annoyed it's it's good that you
guys can see I do get annoyed at soup as
well like it's just I know I know so
many people going through the same thing
and especially like a lot of you guys
messaged me when you're wanting to start
a YouTube channel or you want to start a
blog or something and you're like I'm
nervous that people will judge me like
it around my area and that just oh I
can't express to you anything that makes
me more upset
first off or more annoyed because I'm
just kind of like people need to give up
with being judgey about people doing
stuff that's different like no one's
judging you because you're passionate
about science or studying law or you
know it's a typical kind of job that a
lot of people want to do you know you're
showing it you're smart you're academic
you're going to be successful because
you do Lauren's stuff why is there this
like social thing around people doing
stuff that's different or artistic or
unique or a bit risky it's like god
forbid you're being risky
not succeed you may not make money like
it's just this it's so oh my god this is
turning into an actual ranch video but
it's just superficial you know and it's
just it's what people are growing up
hearing from parents from older people
like you need to be successful like
there's so much pressure on success it's
like maybe I just want to live my life
and have fun with what I do I just
that's why I like to promote it like
happiness you live your life how you
want I don't know it makes me so upset
because people and holding back from
doing stuff that they love and that
they're so talented at just because
they're scared of what people are going
to say about them like people should
just be supportive you know if someone's
awesome at something or is taking taking
like a step in like being gutsy to do
something different like I respect that
more than anything you know it's risky
and it's it's you may you may really
succeed or you may really fail but
you'll learn you'll learn something from
both like you are kind of sitting here
and like feel like you're in the same
headspace is me about this or you're
like tossing up between something or you
don't know you know I've got pressure on
you from people take it from me just do
what you love honestly who cares if
you're not gonna be a millionaire who
cares if people are gonna look at you
and be like what is she doing like judge
you for it I promise you later on in
life they'll probably sit back and think
oh god I wish I could have done that
like I wish I could have done what I
loved now I'm not happy in this job
where I'm not happy with who I don't
even know it she annoys me and I'm lucky
enough to have kind of looked paths and
I've been able to do what I like I mean
cared what people have thought of
they're just people that comment not in
your life and if anything just try and
learn something from them like all the
people that have put me down
I've growing up I've just learned from
it I moved on yes I don't know
made any sense I'm sorry I felt like I
just totally raged at my camera I'm
sorry but I'm very I'm very passionate
about that like I have a message that I
want to send and I feel like I've been
I've been lucky enough to have such an
awesome following online and I have this
ability that I can try and help people
like which is awesome that's why I love
YouTube the most laughs got this ability
that I'm like I can actually help some
people going through the same stuff that
I've been through and remind them that
they have the right to like live their
life the way that they want to live it
and not just through other people's
rules and a bit set for them like I
don't know I just I hope like you guys
kind of can get to know my view on
everything okay so to keep us on track
since I finished my rant I feel like I
got what I needed to say out I just did
my bronze on and I'm adding at my peachy
cane blush with my my zoeva blush brush
I'm so excited I woke up this morning at
my friend yes he texts me she 10 she
tagged me this photo of a donut on
Instagram it's this like doughnut place
in Brisbane and she's like today my cool
meme like okay I need to film two videos
today but afterwards you're picking me
up and we're going and going up and then
I was like okay Joan do me a favor I was
like do you want to see 50 shades of
grey again because she saw it the other
day and I still haven't seen it I'm
busting to see it I feel like I'm either
gonna love it or I'm gonna hate it
because I was like feminism and he
shouldn't been doing that to her and not
that I even know the storyline I just
mean that there's a lot of sex involved
either way I try not to take it too
seriously
no one hate on me to sing at my god I
know some other people have been totally
whiplash like why would you even see it
and I was watching Shaunie's video and
it was saying like people were sending a
hate for seeing it I was like
why it's a movie everyone please relaxed
I don't actually know what I want to do
with my eyes yet today I think I'll end
up just doing super simple it was my Mac
soft and gentle highlighter uhm
miniature my eyes now I'm kind of
thinking just I really like my usual
kind of like a light shimmer shade but
instead of using my chocolate pisspot I
found one of my little MAC eyeshadow
quads this is an exquisite ego and it's
got like a really light shimmer tone
here and then a gold shimmer tone I do
remember last time I use this it really
wasn't that great like it didn't
actually stick on to my eyes at all but
I'm just gonna try it again and see how
he go I've been doing this a lot lately
I've been using brown eyeliner and
smudging it along my uhm under my lash
line I think it just looks really I
don't know it gives like a very smoky
bohemian look I don't know why I would
describe as I just kind of what it
reminds me of and for me I thought it
opens up my eyes in a weird way like I
don't know how it does that but it just
does now I'll just be putting on my Too
Faced better than sex mascara Oh get out
get out it's been cycloning if you guys
didn't know there was a cyclone on like
Friday or Saturday in northern
Queensland and it was raining all week
it was all not sunny anywhere and today
I planned to go to the waterfall again
because we were supposed to a last
weekend but started raining
plenty under the waterfall today
cancelled with every uncas of the rain
and stuff and now the Sun has just come
full burst it looks like it's stinking
hot outside it's a beautiful day birds
chirping the wind is blowing it would
have been the best waterfall day why
does that mother nature do this to me
you know it'd be so cool
imagine if I had like a YouTube meetup
at a waterfall like that is what I'd
like to call live in that would be so
cool and for my lips I'm going to be
using my new favorite MAC lipsticks it
is I'm put politely pink by Mac elope
you guys
have been commenting on my Instagram
photos like what lipstick is is this
really nice a frosty pink but it's not
overly frosty and then over the top I'm
gonna be putting on my good covergirl
lip gloss because my Kiko one ran out
and this is the color honey to kiss it
is so just like a nice pinky shimmer
tone that goes over this color perfectly
okay so this is the completed makeup
look
thank you all if you watched until the
end of my ranting and my just talking
about random stuff I hope you liked this
like a different kind of chitchat video
I was just like I want to voice this and
see what else are the people thinking if
anything kind of resonated with you from
what I said comment below I can talk to
you guys about it and we'll have a bit
of a chat down there um besides that I
hope you all enjoyed this video I hope
you all have a wonderful week so thank
you all so much for watching and I'll
