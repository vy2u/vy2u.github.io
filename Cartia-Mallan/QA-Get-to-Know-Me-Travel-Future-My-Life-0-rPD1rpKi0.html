everyone so today I'm going to be doing
something a little bit different just
going to sort of be like a get to know
me better tag video um where I'll answer
like a whole heap of random questions
that I find online so I'm literally like
mashing up the get to know me tag with
15 random question tag and this and that
tag I don't even know I'm just mixing up
a whole heap and pretty much this will
just be me answering a whole heap of
random questions and some other
questions that like I remember that you
guys always ask me
so I'll just clarify some things and
yeah random ones okay first question
what a nickname your family calls you Oh
ever since I was little I've always been
called Bubba that's bu bb-8 like ba ba
like a little Bubba like Babu like I
don't know some couples Pablito that my
brother and my dad and my mum all still
call me Bubba like it is really
embarrassing and it's kind of weird
especially my brother calls me because
like that's what I've been coming when I
was a little all good because like
you're younger now that I'm older it's
like I used to play netball and I'd be
like no about to shoot a hoop and then
there's my family like hey ba ba de ba
ba I don't really like you and I was
like I didn't yeah not a fan of the
nickname what side of the bed do you
sleep on well I mean it depends which
way of looking at the bed okay if you're
looking at a bed front on like boom I
sleep on the right cuz there's a wall on
the left
would you ever bungee jump I would I
would cry and scream cry a bit more and
be was like really horrified but I would
do it and I really do want to do it
because it'd be awesome um I don't think
I'm like mentally prepared to do it
right now but give me a few years and I
will happily do it which way do you face
in the shower oh my god I was like that
is such a stupid question that is not a
stupid question that's a very oh I hope
that none of you guys like face the wall
that'd be weird if you just like face
the wall I face I face away from away
from the shower like the show
I was here and I'm not like facing it
I'm like facing like that way like
looking to the other way how did you do
that that is stressful if you're like
facing the wall which whip when I was
ready that was like what's a good
question to ask that's not a stupid
question that is a very important thing
to ask is it just me or is that like me
does everyone face away from the shower
I sort of feel I don't know anyways
what's your favorite comfort foods that
bad but you love to eat it anyways
no comfort food is bad okay maybe it's a
little bit bad but okay I have a
legitimate obsession with ice cream ice
cream above like anything I love ice
cream oh my gosh I could just if there's
a tub there and it's like really good
ice cream at all I well I would and I
could demolish the whole thing but then
afterwards I'd feel really really guilty
and I'd probably be like okay I need to
go for a run or something and like drink
a million cups of green tea and then cry
but still so good Oh
marshmallows volleys noodles oh my god
bananas I love been on destroy
raspberries raspberries
that's so funny mum's like had to go to
yoga and she's trying to like sneak out
the door quietly little kitty I love my
mom Gemini brothers or sisters yes I
have one brother his name is Harrison he
is turning 18 years old in about two
months um I don't know what else to say
can't speak eyebrows you think this
eyebrow game is strong go look at
Harrison's his eyebrows will actually
like so anyways hi Harrison um okay a
favorite smell vodka nut oil
oh my tanning oil like quicken art and
like pineapple ice smells or mix them
together Oh another parrot smelt the
smell of incense like I burn incense
like literally like five everyday or so
the smell of incense is like relaxes me
so much like being in like a meditation
temple and just being like do you have
any special talents
well yes I can I can bend my hand back
and I can sort of do it oh yeah I can do
it there do you have any hobby
I have a lot of hobbies one hobbies
YouTube videos I absolutely love making
YouTube videos as a hobby and I think
it's so much fun and make ups one of my
hobbies that's kind of like one of my
biggest hobbies I guess is just like
doing makeup for people and making
makeup videos and all that good stuff um
another hobby taking photos I have so
many cameras and I just love taking pill
photos and like collecting them
especially polaroid photos I have a
Polaroid collection that have a bit of
like my polaroid collection it's all
kind of like in my desk area computers
or TV computers I barely ever watch TV
and if I was to watch TV I'd watch it on
my laptop what do you want to be when
you grow up um I want to be a lot of
things I have a lot of like ambitions
and a lot of goals
yeah a lot of things that I want to
achieve in my life the main thing I
guess is just to be successful of
whatever I do decide to endeavor on and
just like like my goals pretty much just
have like a really happy life I don't I
don't I want to do something I enjoy and
love and I think that's the key to
having a happy life so yeah I just hope
that whatever I do decide on doing I'm
successful and like my main dream would
be to becoming a film actress so like on
like doing movies and TV but I would
really be happy enough just becoming
successful on YouTube and like opening
my own business or something like that
