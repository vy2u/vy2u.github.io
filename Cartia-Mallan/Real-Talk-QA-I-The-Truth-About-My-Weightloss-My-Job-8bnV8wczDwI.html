a Q&amp;amp;A for you guys it has been a while
since I just sat down with children on
my bed I have some green tea I leave to
go to LA in about a week from now and so
I just thought it'd be a good idea to
sit down and do a little update chat
with you guys and so hold your questions
that you've asked and you know I miss
you guys let's just chat first question
what is a terrible gift you wish that
you had and wish I could see and how do
you keep so motivated with yoga and
thinking positive all the time like
honestly I got to a point in my life and
I was like there's nothing else to do in
this lifetime than to feel good if it
feel happiness and to feel joy and still
content and satisfied is like the best
feeling you can get to in this lifetime
whether that's through love for them
through following a passion like
anything it doesn't matter that's what
keeps me motivated I'm like why would I
not try to do my best and be my best
self and to see on my best all the time
throughout every single day of my life
like why not so that's what keeps me
motivated I'm like well do I want to
live a happy life after filling life
that I wake up every day I get to smell
like yes I don't want to wake up and
feel like so I keep motivated and
doing these things like doing yoga makes
me really happy but not only yoga like
working out just being a good person
doing things I love and remaining
positive that's not always easy like
that but it that is possibly one of the
hardest things now reminding yourself to
be positively grateful and everything
but you have to take the extra steps
every day just to remind us of what
you're grateful for and why you should
be happy because it is the best feeling
ever I love it I love feeling happy it's
just it's like the most addictive thing
to me when I wake up and I feel happy
I'm like how can I keep this sustained
throughout the whole day throughout the
next day throughout the next week
throughout my entire life
so that is what keeps me motivated do
you think you're living sitting for the
rest of your life are you planning
moving elsewhere I do not think I could
ever classify one spot to live the rest
of my life in the thought of that
literally cripples me you guys know me
and you you guys do know me because you
see everything I do I when I get back to
Sydney after being overseas I can
probably be here for a month and then I
get really into travel I need to move
whether that's just to the goalpost
whether that's overseas or just I don't
know I get very frustrated being in one
place for too long just because I love
to experience things and I learn a lot
more when I'm traveling experiencing
things so I certainly do not think I
will be living in Sydney for the rest of
my life I plan to live in many different
places throughout my last time I have no
attachment to anywhere like I don't have
any attachment to any city any place I
go where I feel my heart I told my heart
sends me you know and a lot lately has
been sending me to LA with all my
friends of LA and my friends are my
family because I don't live in the same
city as my family what of my work
revolves around travel so you know my
home is where my heart is and my heart
is with all the people that I love that
it's like friends and yes I love my
family but like you know I I can't wait
to live in just so many different places
and experience different cultures and
just oh it is exciting the delicious the
sort of life in general and I'm still 18
that I still have so much life ahead of
me well who really knows I could die
tomorrow but at least I can say I have
had fun so far what do you think of age
differences in relationships I do not
see one single issue with it at all most
of the time I date guys older than me
not see an issue with it at all the
friends that have guys that the day guys
much older than them or even guys that
date women much older than them like age
is just a freaking number like your
maturity levels or the way you might
connect with someone does not depend on
your age right
stupid allergy go about getting over
someone that's never fun but my best
advice is and it's going to be so
annoying you're like shut the up is
for dumb but it's time time heals all
wounds
crying crying helps a lot writing any
time I've ever been trying to go into
someone or I've been like oh it's just
about it like really torn up and
heartbroken and just like him and I was
right so I love to just write out my
feelings whether gentlemen writing
poetry about it and crying about it and
listening to music and imagining them
and like reliving it but then being like
okay each day it just gets easier
because you're like oh cool I have to
get over this and it's just like facing
a harsh reality kind of yeah I would say
maybe don't sabotage yourself by looking
through old photos or videos or anything
that really reminds me too much of them
that's the thing is the pain you feel
right now will not last forever so it's
just kind of one of those things and
life works like you just got to suck it
up what would you say to someone who
wants your life and how how do you
manifest your success as well as staying
humble and down to earth
well what would I say to someone that
wants my life um I would honestly say I
was going to like sound weird but I like
I'm in two minds about it constantly I
would say firstly be careful what you
wish for and secondly go for it and go
grab it like do it but do it for
yourself in your own way um my first
point be careful what you wish for is
that this life the life that you guys
see that I live there's a lot more to it
than what you see through a screen or
what you see through my Instagram page
or what you hear me talk about there's a
lot of internal and emotional struggles
that come with this job and I'm not
complaining at all I would never still
change anything about my life and the
way it's panned up because this job
allows me to help people and in turn
that is actually what I'm most
passionate about and what I want to do
in my lifetime but it's life that I live
is it's incredibly um strange
considering most of the
like around most of my friends do not
understand this world or most of the
people that I used to be friends with
and no longer my friends because I live
such a different life to most normal
humans and that is amazing but it is
also a very hard thing to come to terms
at such a young age while I'm also
growing up learning about myself and
then I have hundreds of thousands of
people who are watching analyzing
critiquing every single thing that I do
and also the fact that life I live there
is no off switch
I cannot turn back in time and just say
wait no I don't want to do this like
pause because this is my life now and I
also have passions that swarm from this
but there many things that I have had to
learn at such a young age and also I was
saying this to my friend other day I
think she was saying to me something
something like just going to holiday
like have a break you know like give
yourself a break and I was like I
literally have not had a break since
like in three years like I was working
when I was in school like in my lap two
years of school I was non-stop doing
YouTube well at least I was just kind of
doing it as a side hobby Fame and it it
eventuated into something that was
really full-time in the minute I
finished school it was like bang like
and the thing with this is and the thing
with me is I'm so passionate about what
I do so that I can't turn it off but
then again to keep up with this career
you need to be one step ahead always
like it's always it doesn't stop it's a
very fast-paced lifestyle you have a lot
of pressure on you all the time and
that's why I turn to spirituality and my
turn to health and fitness and why I
turn to living that lifestyle because
that is what grounds me going on to a
second point like my biggest fear and
what frightens me so much about my life
is that my numbers they keep going up
more and more people learn about me more
and more people find out about me and
yes that's what the goal of this all is
but for me that really finds me I am
such a showy and out there person and I
love attention and I love talking to
people but at the same time I do
very shy and sometimes I reflect and I'm
like I really miss being able to go to a
gig and people not coming out to me and
I really miss times I'll be so on my
head at events and places like Tahoe
he's looking at me and like I feel
really like like I just want to curl up
into a bowl and like alright that's
where it gets conflicting because it's
like these people that are looking at
you actually adore you and know probably
everything about you like in in your
life and they actually could be like
good never known it's like confusing and
it's hard to explain the one thing that
I've learned honestly after doing trips
to LA and meeting all these people over
there and meeting people here and then
getting to experience things I never
thought I'd be able to experience is
they're all I've learned after all of it
and all that keeps me really humble is
seeing that most of the people that get
to the top top like I'm talking
celebrity status or even people that are
making so much money people that have so
many followers and subscribers and stuff
like that I cannot even tell you you
probably everyone hears all the time and
no one seems to want to listen to this
fact is that numbers and money do not
buy happiness does not make you happy
most of the people at the very top of
the same ladder so severely depressed
and upset and the main thing that they
are is unsatisfied because they're
climbing this ladder to the top of
nothingness where they lose everything
that makes them them on the way so I'm
doing is to help inspire people to want
to be themselves you know and having
that purpose and it's really about
finding your purpose and like it's
something we might say my purpose is to
make youtube videos I'm like no my
purpose isn't to make youtube videos my
cousin is to help people so that's why I
stay committed to this even though this
career in this job and having so much
attention on me really actually freaks
me out which is that's so hard for me to
say because I don't think I've ever
actually said that online and I don't
really talk about it much to most people
because it's just something I deal
with on my own because it is a very
personal thing also why I enjoy being
around other content creators in nature
is because we're seeing that we all
share it's like hey yeah we have like
thousands of people that randomly found
us online one day you thought of losing
myself and losing kardia the person that
you guys all actually admire they ever
lost her in this career and this job in
as well I would just so yeah every
single day I remind myself of Who I am
and that I'm no better or no worse than
anyone else on this planet
and that is what helps me continue that
was such a rant and a ramble but I think
yeah my life is amazing and I
love it and I honestly encourage you all
to chase down that thing in you that
wants this kind of life or whatever you
perceive my life to be but do it in your
own way and do it in a way that it's so
authentic and original to you and
exactly what you desire because I
promise you you can get it and it just
takes being on top of this look after
your mental state that's what's the most
important thing about all of it and your
heart looking after your heart and your
mind and your soul and your body are you
spirit how much weight have you lost
since you started your health journey so
before I started youtube I lost a lot of
weight I like revealing everything Sam
something very honest this is so hard
for me to talk about honestly mmm
anyone who has been overweight or is a
bit chubby or you know it knows how hard
a topic this is I've experienced the
worst bullying around my body growing up
and I can laugh about it now because I
overcame and it made me so much stronger
but like anyone who's ever dealt with
anything like that knows how hard it is
to talk about it it is so crippling in
every need to be able to think about it
properly it was my own thing I dealt
with I talked to my mom about it it was
an issue that I dealt with for years
and I growing up I'm super overweight I
was an emotional eater I dealt with my
parents divorce and I was being bullied
at school yeah I was still like a
popular girl it was like a very
confusing situation but I had a lot of
girls that was super horrible to me and
so eating was my emotional like thing
that I would do growing up that just
made me feel like confident you know I
know a lot of people can relate to that
and food can be very comforting but
about grade 9 I think I started I woke
up one day and I was like I cannot keep
doing this to myself
I was so extremely overweight it was
very unhealthy and I wanted to live my
life I wanted to go to parties and feel
confident I wanted to go out and be able
to wear the clothes that I wanted to I
didn't want to keep hiding my body
hiding myself and I didn't want to keep
getting picked on and because I knew I
was unhealthy and overweight so since
grade 9 I have lost about like 25 kilos
has been a long period of time I didn't
do any like sad dieting and I'm not
making this like my weight loss journey
videos that will come and you guys will
be shocked because those old
photos I mean it literally looks like a
completely different person but yeah I
lost a lot of weight when I was in high
school and that was just from eating
healthy and exercising and having a
positive mindset I honestly put down
having a positive mindset too much of my
weight loss and having passion it within
me to motivate me to live my best life
so yeah yeah that is one thing most
people do not know about me because you
meet me a person you'd be like um just I
can't imagine you being like 25 kilos
heavier than you are now like it's a
very shocking thought so not change one
thing because being overweight and being
bullied to being overweight and dealing
with like the emotional trauma of being
like the little because of your
appearance so intensively made me the
person I am today and made me have so
much more compassion is a really hard
thing to get over and normally can leave
you so trim is God self-conscious
and I have to work on it every day to
remind myself that I've come so far from
where I was and that to honor and
respect my body and give it love and not
to look at myself and hate on myself so
yeah I'm proud of myself for like what
I've achieved in that and that yeah it
took me so long to do because I wanted
to do it in a healthy way and I wanted
to keep the weight off so I took the
time and I'm still on my journey it has
not ended yet it's exciting I love it I
love being able to be on a journey with
and challenge myself like it's so
rewarding I talk so much next
question what is the best part of your
life oh my god everything in my life is
amazing you guys my friends my family my
guess my my career right now is going in
a path where it's very passion driven so
lots of ideas that I've had stored in my
head are finally able to see the light
of day or is slowly getting there so I
have the people around me to help me now
it's just so incredible what you can do
when you really put your mind to it and
also just right now I feel so content

grateful and I adore every single part
