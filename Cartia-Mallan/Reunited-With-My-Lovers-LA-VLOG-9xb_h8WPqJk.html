just too busy so we came back we got in
the hot tub now heading to go and get
some breakfast I didn't even tell you my
whole laptop crashed yesterday so today
I have to go take it in to the Apple
store get that fix and I should also
probably invest in getting my phone's
music cuz it's been this crack for five
months now and it just chipped even more
last night
I definitely think that means I should
go and get it ordered because I just
have the strongest feeling if I leave it
any longer it's all going to like all of
its going to die let's go get some food

our MV I was just wanting to vlog this
