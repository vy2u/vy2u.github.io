solidified that we're like the same
person really died this is sad but like
it's fun yeah see each other in
literally three when the reason like it
I'm so happy it's sad like I was late uh
yeah
I'm hangin selfies bags am hi guys thank
you for having me on your day divine he
looking back good morning guys okay so I
have woken up it's so cold this morning
I woke up and I was supposed to go for a
walk but it is raining so instead I'm
just going to lay in bed for a little
bit longer than normal and kind of work
from here for a little bit I woke up and
found the cutest little letter that
Cioffi had written me and also she left
me a present she got me a new tip tea
candle and I'm just about to smell what
it smells like and she also got me this
really cool wall a hanging thing that
you put on a glass window and it creates
rainbows because she knows that I love
rainbows I was so excited I was like
I've always wanted a house with louvers
in Sammy's house because I love when
like rainbow streaks like fly into a
room
excuse my face I look so exhausted tired
I swear I still haven't caught up on
enough sleep from the festival it's
extreme and I'm also just laying in bed
for a little bit and reading at my
friend Izzy mentes new poetry book
called at seven thousand three hundred
days I read some of this when Haley was
in Australia and I cried it is so
beautiful so I'm really excited to read
through some more which is such a
beautiful writer and I love that poetry
book can I also have milk and honey that
I finished on the plane like they're
both fairly similar but I love them
they're so good I love reading poetry
because you guys know I'm a frickin sad
girl it's just nice when I read stuff
like milk
Izzie's book because it weirdly puts
stuff that you feel into like poetic
language and it just like almost
validates it and makes it feel like
really beautiful and yeah all that good
mushy stuff
um I've so much cleaning to do today my
apartment is a mess I haven't unpacked
my bags from the festival yet so lots of
video planning lots of planning for this
month I'm planning a new series of
videos which is going to be get fit with
me I'm going to be selling my personal
trainer next week so I think I'm going
to be training with him three or four
times a week I'm hoping for four times a
week I really just want to do like an
intensive lot of training before Hawaii
get this boat in shape and he's also
going to be giving me a diet plan so I'm
not normally one for diet plans um I
have a super healthy diet um but I think
that switching it up will not hurt um
I'm not for calorie restricting or any
of that I don't think this is
what the diet plan will be I think it's
just going to be getting the right foods
that are going to burn and they're gonna
do all that stuff so yeah I'm just going
to chill out for a bit more plan out
some dates plan out some stuff do some
writing some reading chilling out I'm
going to then meditate I'm going to do
