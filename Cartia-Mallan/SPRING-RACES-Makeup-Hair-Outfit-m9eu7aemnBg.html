collaboration with a sauce to show you
guys how I've taken a sour punch to
create a unique outfit for the spring
races usually the person around the
sigmund is extremely predictable so I've
decided to do something different and
stand out from the crowd a sauce has a
really great stop on this game on their
website to help you find some really
really good outfits for their spring
races and you can also figure out what
your spirit horse is just by playing
this little game even better you can go
into the running to win a trip to London
and there's also really great new prizes
each round that you play so happy style
hunting everyone I hope you enjoy your
spring racing season for the makeup I'm
starting out with the clear fresh face
and I'll be applying some primer just so
that all the foundation and makeup stays
on all day long
I've gone ahead and applied some
foundation some concern also filled in
my eyebrows now moving on to the eyes
I'm taking this really beautiful frosty
pearl color with just a flat shader
brush and I'll be paying this all over
my lid
I'm then taking a light brown matte
color and blending this into my crease
and then is taking a bit of a darker
matte Brown again on a like medium-sized
pencil brush and I'm just kind of
messily applying this to my outer V it
doesn't matter if it's not perfect
because you can just keep blending and
blending until you've built up the color
to how you want it and then I'll take a
blending brush a big fluffy one and
blend this color out so it's nice and
seamless and the colors just flow
together well now I'm just taking my
brown eyeliner just like a little pencil
eyeliner and I'm applying this under my
lash line just really messily and then
also applying this within my waterline
then I'm just taking these two cars on a
smaller pencil brush and applying this
underneath my lash line again just to
make it a little bit darker then to
bring the eyeshadow look altogether I'm
taking this frosty color and just
applying it in my inner corner
personally you guys know I really love
doing big winged out cat eye liner so
I'm just taking a brown liner and doing
exactly that but this is optional it
would also look nice just leaving it
here and putting on some either falsies
or just packing on the mascara either
way whatever you prefer
I'm then going to slightly contour and
warm up the face with a bronzer and just
a big fluffy Bruns a brush and nothing
like too much of a hard contour just
really gentle and lad then I'll just be
taking this really beautiful rosy pink
cream blush and putting it onto my
cheeks and then I'll be blending it out
with a stippling brush I love having a
really glowy highlighted look on my face
so I'm just taking a highlighter brush
and it's really pretty pearly
highlighter and applying it to my cheeks
and my nose and my Cupid's bow and then
keeping them lips really simple I'm just
taking this nude color and putting it
all over my lips and then I didn't
really like it Mac so I decided to put
more of a glossy lip tone over the top
as well
starting out by just brushing my hair to
make sure there's no not sooner and then
I'm going to be parting it into three
separate parts so that I can start
curling it everyone has their different
preferred ways of curling I personally
love using it hair straight now this is
how I find it the easiest so with the
section that's done I split it into two
parts and then just do two parts on each
side I find that super easy and there's
always just like enough hairs not too
much it's just the perfect amount and it
creates a really nice cup
so once it's all being cold I like to
lightly brush through the curls just to
create really nice soft waves and then
you can either leave your hair like this
but since we're going for style hunting
and we're trying something new and
different instead of just wearing a
typical headpiece for a rake for the
races I'm going to be taking this
absolutely amazing little flower bobby
pin hair piece clip I don't know exactly
what you'd call it but what I'm going to
be doing is bringing the two front parts
of my hair up and pulling them together
and then just really messily platting
this down the middle so then it creates
just it's like a good way to just pull
it up and keep it out of my face while
also creating and following with that
bohemian style that we're going for then
I'm just taking the little bobby pin
head piece and I'm sliding it in there I
kind of put it in a bad spot but you can
you know alter it around and hook it in
a better way and it just looks like that
and I've also pulled out the front parts
of my hair
man
for my app - today all of these items
are from ASOS I'm wearing a really
beautiful white lace place it with these
gorgeous tan heels and instead of a
classic spring raises headpiece I've put
on a really nice flower head clip so
thank you guys so much for watching my
spring races video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
