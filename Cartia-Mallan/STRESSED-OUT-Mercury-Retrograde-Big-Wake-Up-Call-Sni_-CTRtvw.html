flustered we're already running light so
I'm like I want to change but then I'm
like actually I am I'm gonna have to see
what else I have because I think I'm
just gonna be annoying
hey guys her a little bit light whatever
just in the green room at beautify and
just just hanging out really like we
just tried FaceTime Jaco and Alex and
none of our family members answering how
some really hard work and I so it's
perfect we're going on
oh damn and I just attacking all the
bubble cheese and the rice paper rolls
finally time to the panels I'm just got
to go out and talk Cambron sleepy now
ready you ready for this
laughing it looks like we're about to do
a big dance recital up in this marrow
like it
monkey human collect I just was insane
experience like maintaining it
with a man like giving away stance about
it but the most inspiring amazing humans
I never thought I'd be around people
like the people that I Wednesday and
like the messages I get and the people I
speak to in life even when you want to
come and approach me in the
conversations I'm having with me often
coming I feel like rainbow kids like
leaders everyone is so switched on and
they just with them and I think care
about something they want to make a
change and I'm so like inspired by the
people that I'm connecting with and also
obviously it's the luxury of having this
line that I can live out my dream I
think about what I feel like I'm here to
do I can just be i serving I want to
tell people I just I just get really
excited about that and yeah it's just
some arts insane community of like
incredible you like I think they use is
just getting
this
yeah that was it
so did I get to I know she got all
empowering and everyone's like yeah and
I was like Kylie screaming I got the
best people support and we are pleased
family Oh where's that sickly family I
need to talk to Jack oh it's really
important since we got home from
beautifier we've just been having some
drinks for the afternoon and Morgan's
just got back to his place and then
we're going to meet about is gonna come
and we're not really tie but we're like
it's Saturday night May as well see you
know
and money is my I majority of my vlogs
on me in bed
so last night I probably didn't make
very much sense
pretty much Alex for shells I'm Alex's
friends Morgan my friend Ricardo and I
we all went to marquee to go and watch
um Terra a ke day at tag Lily play Emily
stayed for literally like 20 minutes
she's because I was so so tired to the
event yesterday I really shouldn't have
gone hours but I like let everyone
convinced me go and I was just exhausted
um and like big clubs like that aren't
really my scene I just like don't really
know what to do I'm like II I'm just
editing my video with Michelle and
Jackie right now I'm going to get that
uploaded and then I'm going to go at
some lunch with Morgan and then I need
to clean my apartment cause it is such a
mess and I want to try and go on a walk
this afternoon because I haven't
exercised in a few days because I've had
people staying here and I get as I
mentioned I get really stressed when I
can't exercise and it's just a really
good stress relief so I need to do that
I've literally just been editing and
like chilling out all day and I'm so
happy it was exactly what I needed to do
especially since Mercury retrograde is
starting tomorrow so it's really
important to just take out some good
time to rest and rejuvenate so right now
I get to come back so it's like my
weekly like routines
I'm just running a bar guys look how the
luck this set up look just got some
candles burning here at the end of the
room smells so nice I'm gonna read for a
little bit not bring my phone in here
and just chill out it's just like
exactly what I need think of having to
do this on a Sunday night because
tomorrow why we doing lots of work today
so it's good just to treat your body
well you don't realize how much stress
and actually injuries and fill it up
with stress or product just a lot of
stuff and having a bath is a really good
way to release it and also reading is a
really great way just to take your mind
off technology etc so I'm going to go
enjoy my bath and I'll speak to you guys
later
decided to go exercising I'll ricotta
with her Oh mom you never taught me how
to change a tire how'd this happen how
do you even know my spare tire is
Ricardo you're so onto this I'm so lucky
to have a boy like you in my life thank
God I never thought I'd ever have to do
this God like I'm literally in shock
that dude that actually fought are you
serious
so we walk down the road to go and get
coffee and then we were thinking it was
going to take like an hour for them to
come now they're here and we're racing
back with the ricotta right now like
look at me I'm flying stop it
Katya doesn't know how to change a tire
and this is her learning
they started the tire guy just left you
know what I do if Ricardo wasn't here
because I freaked in crisis moments when
I haven't learned how to do something
myself so so they just put my spare tire
on and now we're going to go and get the
tire fixed and we were supposed to be
going and doing bondi to bronte but
instead we're just eating he's got a
copy so yeah then I'm just going to come
home and film this is why I don't want
to leave my house ever again yep
this is have a good day positive vibes
mercury retrograde you can't get the
best of me aside from all of the drama
this morning I got home to a delivery
from my management they sent me a bottle
of Maui oh this morning I was like yeah
I'm just gonna go for a nice walk with
Ricardo come home meditate and then
start filming and instead it has just
been one big stress but a very big
wake-up call and this is one Mercury
retrograde it's all about it's gonna
throw things my way that I know is
coming and it's just like what do I need
alone and what am I need to improve on
almost like how do you deal with crisis
moments like I know I really need to
like chill out more when something like
happens and I'm unsure of what to do I
say like breed and like know that I'm
capable of handling it okay
now I'm going to get to work and film
some videos
okay so I've just finished putting on my
makeup and getting ready I've just been
so flustered and like kind of snappy
this morning and I don't like when I'm
in this mood but I know I just need to
write it out and just breathe like I'm
completely content I'm just like getting
frustrated of really little things right
now which is annoying but excited to
film this video lately just like filming
for me has been
like a stress relief I'm loving it also
adjusting to the life of wearing this
lip plumping lip gloss stuff it actually
works really really well but it just
hurts my lips so much I'm just about to
film a whole video I realized I haven't
done any Christmas shopping I'm so much
shopping to do so if I have time I'm
going to go down to Bondi Junction and
do some shopping Christmas shopping
really stresses me out because I would
way rather by people experience hasn't
something really really important and
special because they mean the world to
me and so just buying the committee
realistic object but I've left
everything so late that I'm just going
to have to get little presents and then
just write really nice card always end
up writing big long emotional cards for
everyone so yeah that is what is
happening that's literally how I feel is
Nina and this morning even when I went
to meditate Ning to Rachelle's like
guided meditation and then my phone just
kept turning on and off and I was like
yay
so Rochelle just finally got home from
Alex's place then I'm on the outside of
Sydney I see a middle-aged whore Alex

proud of him

like two days we see each other in my
tree guys yeah you literally said to me

the real me because I'm like city as
much as I am Beach but right now it's
like I'm just finding that balance you

Rachelle to the
to the airport airport and then I'm
going to come home and edit my whole
video that I filmed today as some it's
not rap to been so horrible of vlogging
I have pretty much just been busy busy
beer this morning I got up and went for
a walk with Lee and we just got some
coffee afterwards and then I've just
been literally editing my whole video
just got it all finished then it's
currently uploading and now I've just
gotten dressed and I'm just about to
head to Bondi Junction to go and do my
Christmas shopping and literally I've
been putting this off for the past hour
because I honestly hate shopping centres
I get really anxious in them I just get
like I start free cancers just like so
many people also get super overwhelmed
by choice of what to buy and just like
where to go and I always get lost I end
up forgetting where I parked my car and
it's just it's just always not really
the best place for me but um hopefully
real good pray for me and then I'm just
going to come home do all my washing and
get my unit cleaned up because tomorrow
I fly back to the Gold Coast to go and
stay with mum and Chris and Harrison
before Christmas and then other persons
day and then I go to beyond the valley
so I pretty much just have life admin
safety assorted that's what's happening
hey guys what's up what's cracking
what's going on hey Lee guess I cannot
even look at myself right now
I'm a mess oh my god I found my old
glasses
god this is not ki so glasses literally
ages ago that I was supposed to work
while I edit and stuff because my eyes
are all blurry and I just like whip them
out again to see if like just whatever
and I just think
Oh so I didn't even update you guys
since I got home not I just posted a new
video then I'm just replying to comments
but oh my god said I was going to do
Christmas shopping and go to the post
office at Bondi Junction and so okay the
post office was in the freaking car park
like the scent alright and I just get
really anxious going to like big
shopping centers by myself because I
just get overwhelmed okay so I was
already like not looking forward to
going and I was like I'll just go
shopping for a little bit and then I
don't find the post office because I
really need to pick up this parcel I was
getting it redirected so I went shopping
for like 0.5 millisecond because
I was like I just don't know what I need
to buy and those so many people they're
just like I'll come back another day
and then I went to go and find the post
office and I literally got stuck in the
car park for half an hour driving around
because I couldn't find where I was in
the car park there's like a huge pileup
on I was like who the hell puts a post
office in a compound like what do you
mean and so oh my god I was just your
rasping out on the kind of like are like
get living around keeping these two
levels so long and just kept getting so
disorientated confused as I eventually
found the post office up to being in a
fight with this lady about some car park
and I go to the post office and they
were like we don't have your pass miles
like yes you do go and double check and
it varies dress up dude okay I'm happy
now except uploaded and like like
reading your comments never play my
happy place but see a storm is like
brewing right now I'm so excited to
start writing could be so nice to just
finish refine these comments edit my
blog in this one and then go and clean
up there's my poem and because I need to
have an old plane and tied before I
leave Sydney because
I'm not going to be home until after the
years when Cioffi is coming to say my
brother's coming to stay in my apartment
over New Year's oh and there goes the
rain yay I'm loving uploading so much it
is something fun like poker just being
in this apartment and like being able to
just do it and I'm enjoying it so much
Julie funny cuz everyone's like wow
you've changed so much since you moved
to Sydney and I'm like I actually
haven't it's just the Makani that I have
always known it just feels more
comfortable to like project herself a
bit more because all I can say it was
just you can't get hard living in a
beach town when no one else was doing
what I was doing I was like the only one
so it's hard not to be around
like-minded people that understand it um
so it's amazing to now be here and like
also have my own place just be able to
focus because I'm very much a person
that I'm so social that when I'm in a
group of people or those people always
around I want to go and have fun and
socialize and I don't just like sit back
and do my work but here like I'm just so
content being on my own and working and
then going out and seeing my friends so
it is incredible ok so I finally have
all of my stuff packed up to go to the
Gold Coast and I'm supposed to film my
New Year's and makeup and outfit video
today and I didn't get it done in time
so I had to bring my own freaking tripod
to the Gold Coast fell asleep for like a
few hours today I think I was literally
just so exhausted that everything caught
up on me but yeah I'm gonna end this
look here I'm going to do a vlog when
I'm at the Gold Coast
in such a weird afternoon I'm so tired
it's extreme but get dressed for the
airport and then Morgan is coming to
pick me up in this dropping me off so
yes
yeah that is all I have to say I'll stop
rambling leave any comments down below
