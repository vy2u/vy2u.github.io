thinking about you more than themselves
obviously dismiss their girls take it as
a compliment and roll with what she says
I guess I would just tell myself not to
compare myself to other people around me
once you find stop doing that then
you've got the ability and start working
yourself and they can create the best
version of yourself possibly yeah we
possibly be and then you can just have
watch yourself flourish because you're
born with only one self you got yourself
and that's it baby
so sell the love know what we're talking
about hey baby
just stop
to be honest most of my childhood and
teenage years were seriously just full
of boys surrounding my weight my looks
my personality you know what all our
purchases and mountains look at me now
again hey just take off the prop and my
face looks a decoration I remove the
dead tree no phenol serious I guess we
do get a lot of questions as to how it's
so confident oh like it appears like
we're so confident you know we're like
putting ourselves out there on line to a
lot of people and it does require
confidence I mean for me like anyone I'm
subconscious certain days I go through
days where I'm like well yeah I don't to
go out Deborah wrote down but you just
need to think that there's no one else
like you in all honesty when we were
talking about that in the last two Clips
there is only one you and you only have
yourself so you actually have to work
with what you've got like this is so hot
and up front but you're never going to
be that other girl that you want to be
it's it's physically and humanly
impossible so you may as well just
literally work with you god seriously if
I showed you guys old photos with me we
wouldn't even think it's the same person
I I realized not everything in my life
was how I wanted to be that the body I
had the appearance I had it wasn't me at
all so I just work towards changing it
and slowly it doesn't have it overnight
slowly you get convinced I still get so
tired people don't realize how shy shy
just anxious I guess at times that you
can get
in different situations and in different
things because you are kind of a lot of
people that are judging you but if we
can do it you can do it surround
yourself with people oh yeah it's all
about the people you surround yourself
with totally actually that is so true I
remember in the days when I was like
myself conscious the people around me
was so horrid and just put me down all
the time so like you need to surround
yourself with people that make you feel
good about yourself then they know that
they're being genuine around ya like
they can compliment you some people I
swear to god it's like a crime to
compliment like that it's never bad to
compliment someone when they look nice
oh they do something nice you're good
like it's always good to point out
people it always makes people feel good
and you never know what someone's going
through that day so you never you could
come into someone you could smile at
them and that could also change the
entire day like if you just have a
positive attitude towards things and
that will rub off on other people yeah
when you're ready like positivity and
nice energy to people there's no way
that they can fire back and hit you in
any bad way but if you're constantly
saying negative things to your friends
okay if this makes sense so if you're
putting out negative energy saying like
you hate this you hate that but really
inside you're like hating yourself
it's only going to come back to you yeah
giving nice to people eventually people
are nice to you and then you feel good
about yourself and it just like an
ongoing thang yeah so yeah that that's
it yeah that's nothing you do it
positivity isn't the main thing for me
but it's just it's just about being
positive to have to be happy and were
protected got very positive is what
you've got
stop stop wasting time just hating
yourself if that's all you've got you've
got yourself and you have to learn
my cell phone you know what it does in
times of struggle if you can't find
anything you can trip on trip you can't
buy anything that's going to make you
happy hunger plant it's what I do it
really will make you feel better and
then it may be like sometimes I eat it
sometimes I don't
sometimes I just hug you know what I
just like to experiment or looks looks
different things honey stand the laughs
a little more like Oh your hand on my
leg or like oh it's right in the color
body ah yes very funny like involving it
with immediate whatever's in the jungle
the mighty jungle the lion sleeps nice
dog stroll oh oh my god like how do you
keep your body so if it only keeps a hat
just stop hi everyone I'm um I'm Talia
and today we are doing what are we
calling this Sammy this funny what
are we calling this Oh oppa Meenu a

then be with you just wave your
arms in the air like a district care to
