before I actually sound like a proper
apartment ill videos but like wow I feel
like so suddenly emotional when I just
went in like brought some washing in for
my laundry and I walked into my
apartment and I was like I just stood
for a second and I was like this is my
apartment like this is my space in
Sydney and I know this I literally sound
crazy but I was like reminiscing on like
my past six months and where I've come
from
and like the struggles I've been through
where I am now and I'm like reflecting
like holy like I'm 18 years old and
I'm like achieved things that I never
thought I would achieve ever like I
never thought that I would be doing this
stuff over and I'm just having one of
those moments of like extreme gratitude
for the people that have helped me my
family and like you guys my friends guys

photo and my integer Elvis frame but I'm
getting him reframed taking him out of
his girlfriend and putting him in a much
bigger kind of wooden frame and my
little couch I just done smashing it's
not supposed to be in apartment door but

scoops in a pan holy divine you know
Matt the more I have this the more
addictive it gets like every single
night and we're so excited toughest it

I'm like committed to doing something I
will enjoy everything under the given
circumstances I have to you know comply
with so right now this is heaven to me
news like aging a thing of ice cream and
you killed the ice cream and the good
thing about it is Lynn intent

nutritional things that I need in my
diet but it's going to allow me to lose
some weight
