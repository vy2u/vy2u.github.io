said of the tower and I just wanna do my
makeup and then I remembered that I
wanted to vlog so I'd like an exciting
few days coming up and then my doorbell
rang
and I got it I'm usually yes I'm going
to open this up and see what is inside I
was feeling it's my new watches so I'm
so excited because I've been waiting and
to get these but since I got back from
America walk my hair is a mess so let's
open these up and I'll show you guys
what I got okay so I just unpacked
everything and it is all my watches from
the fifth I'm so excited
let me show you guys what I've ordered
and before we do that can we just take a
minute
look how sleepy and beautiful this
packaging is I open up this one the
first
well one-handed unboxing here we go oh
how nice is this is the first word oh my
god not beautiful so excited about this
one because really massive sample so
this one is look you can see me in the
reflection what's up um this one's nice
and simple it can kind of go with any
outfit so this is so nice I love that
yes I love the old black it's very very
slick and will go a lot to outfit so if
yours is so exciting oh my gosh look at
this the second watch is just like a
beautiful rose gold watch it's like a
pink strap oh my gosh I love this is so
pretty it will be really nice with
simple outfits too or to kind of like
just complement and outfit Oh bang bang
look at that I am in love with it it was
so beautiful because they're based out
of Melbourne I love kind of supporting
like Australian like local companies
they also sent me some sunglasses I
think I think I've just started stocking
sunglasses they told me so Wow look at
those oh using the reflection in them
these are so cool these are like a huge
big 8 glasses but I love the design of
them wow these are the first pair of
glasses oh my gosh these are so nice as
well
also a huge fan you guys know I always
wearing my black round glasses I'm so
excited about all these I'm like
since I've been home I just have been
trying to build my wardrobe and get some
new pieces in this stuff is so exciting
I can't wait to wear some of these
watches I definitely think I'm going to
wear one today I'm actually about to get
ready to go to like a lunch meeting
think I'll just a little get ready with
me if you guys but before I do that one
is Lina and got a sneaky little discount
code you guys from this fear so you can
get 10% off with the code kardia so go
check out the new glasses they have and
the watches everything is so affordable
on their website I think like sometimes
watch brands just go like real crazy
with their prices when you can actually
get something really beautiful and
affordable for a good price things are
cool little thing about the fifth art
they're extremely exclusive so you need
to kind of get in quick because they
only sell their products on the 5th of
every month for five days so I think
that was a really cute little little
spin on it all so it doesn't mean if
you're keen on them like jump on board
I'm going to leave the links down below
get to 10% and enjoy that I'm so excited
for you I used to have like a watch that
was a brown leather strap and I didn't
wear it as much but I really always
wanted like a rose gold one and an old
black one but no one had like really
nicely teal black one so I'm so excited
oh and I just looked on the packaging
for glasses and it says that is are
handmade in Italy so that's nice that's
great quality as you can tell I'm going
to pop these babies away in the cases
and then I'm going to show you guys my
makeup that I do today and my outfit
because I have some a few makeup at the
moment so I might kind of stepping
through the makeup I do too quickly so I
just got dressed and then my makeup let
manage elses okay so I've just gotten
just a popped on my watch it goes
perfectly it's just so subtle and just
really casual kind of looking for what
I'm going for
and who do my usual makeup and then just
play on some new products I have like
honestly there's a whole one stuff
I'm going to test out just get into it
as I was just a new primer that I've set
this it's the Smashbox photo finish
primer and I just love this I'm gonna
have a really good primer in quite a
while
so it sure has the consistency of this
and it keeps my makeup on very well and
in my old time job session it'd just be
a binary T 210 @ face and body I want to
make a like showcase the other week and
they showed me the shop and I am
obsessed too much it's just like fake
tans your face but it's not both your
skin it's kind of a pre thing that you
don't have to put on foundation like
when I put this I never put on much
foundation office but you'll see what it
does it just levels up with skin tones
and if you shake the bottle have white
glitter in there so you can either if
you're close you can ask you make them
stuff so I just get like a fluffy brush
and I just spray like like two sprays on
it just for a really subtle color up
just looks really natural and I test
this out a nice little session or
minimizing makeup my benefit and like
I've used this like the Porefessional
primer that this is actually like makeup
makeup like it has color to it sure if
I'm doing this correctly
well good color much wow so light on the
skin really weird it's like it's like a
liquid it's like all just little like
liquid drop I'm not sure if you actually
like supposed to put this all over your
face okay and I'm just going to pop on
that some concealer and my naked skin of
Education fill it in medium light
neutral I love this stuff that I'm just
going to use a little bit of my
hourglass and being light lighting
powder and so then we color luminous
light it just is so beautiful it adds
like a little bit of luminosity to the
skin after you put on your makeup
dude proof a brow pencil by benefit I
love this and slowly on the end which I
love because I'm I always lose my
schoolies and yeah the brow pencil is
just it's so great well this stuff rumba
I've been trying out the noon on the
shade seaside and you have to blossom
Tampines a little bit on the end of me
and they can tell it I just love this
kind of turn of blush the lighting is
really really horrible and you actually
talked with a product look like what
I'll show you how to like to make up one
fourth of July my favorite part right
now lipstick I got sent the girl love
lipstick palette this is a key to just
causing them but as such has the most
beautiful newsmen that I've been using
the color peacemaker and believe at the
moment I've been jumping between these
two shades it's so buttery and smooth
but it doesn't rub off too easily either
so this is what the makeup looks like as
I mentioned just a super casual lunch
meeting and I'm going to try don't want
to do anything to ever tell all those
folks are really cool that was really
fun this comment playing around with
them I should do that more often
