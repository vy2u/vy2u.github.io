you play this little bit of hair is just
bugging me all right let's just do this
everyone so hey everyone so today I'm
going to be showing you my September
favorites this month I really haven't
been buying very many makeup products
I've been kind of slacking off with my
makeup side of things I don't know I
just haven't been thinking about buying
new products all of my products have
kind of been like the ones that I've
been using have been perfectly fine for
me but I have a lot of random products
and a lot of other things that I have
really been loving this month
so pretty much let's just stop me
babbling and I'm gonna jump straight
into showing you I'll start with the
beauty products like the makeup products
just because there's actually really not
that many I start off with my newest
product it is a Mac mixing media this
it's like a little if you can see a
little clear tube of full mixing medium
which I like to use this when I am
putting pigment shadows on and I just
put a little bit of this on my hand and
I mix it with the pigment and it just
applies it so much easier no fallout it
like helps it sound for longer and
whatnot I'm loving it it's just really
helpful and you can use it with any of
your eyeshadows just to kind of make
them pop and look nice next up my
favorite lipsticks that I've been loving
this month and that I've been using
these lipsticks for quite a long time
now but mainly just lately I've just
been loving them even more the revlon
colorburst lip butters of three colors I
think I've got more but I don't know
where they've gone the first color is
sugar frosting which is literally fully
run out which is really sad because they
love that color one that I've been using
probably the most this month is pink
lemonade and it's just a really nice
glossy pink tone I actually have it on
now and then lastly I have the color
tutti frutti which I used in my holy
cons inspired makeup which is just a
nice orange e color
they last really well they're really
buttery and soft and they just like I
don't know it is going nicely it's
pretty much just like having a lip
on the go but not that like not like
over-the-top glossy like when like the
wind blows and your hair gets stuck it's
not like it's not that it's just like a
good good ratio of like lipstick to
gloss next up I have my favorite
eyeliner which I think I've mentioned
already in a previous video that this is
my favorite but I'll mention it again
because it's my Holy Grail this is the
L'Oreal Paris super line art perfect
slim and I love this because the tip of
it is just really small and you can
really like get into your inner corner
and make a wing really nice I always
like to have big winged eyeliner so this
is perfect for it like it's getting
really hot in my room and I can't open
up the windows because it makes these
sounds there's all these birds and like
I'll be back when I sort out something I
need like one of those little portable
fans it just alright nothing really
could be resolved I'm just gonna have to
suffer in silence for a little bit but
that's alright we'll get through this
together and we'll be fine so let's move
on to some skincare products beauty
other beauty products so first up I'm
gonna start with something that I've
been loving ever since forever
I love it like so much I don't even know
it's just great it completes me it makes
me happy
it is beautiful and I need nothing else
in my life but my beautiful Rexona sexy
deodorant like that was a dramatic intro
to bring this little puppy in but let me
tell you something I cannot last a day
or even a few hours without this
deodorant I've become like reliant on it
like I cannot use any other deodorant
okay let me start out why I like this
data and so much it smells absolutely
amazing like it smells like a perfume
that everyone just like once lost well
for me I love the bottle it's really
nice
seriously I have so many it's ridiculous
but and well to them I cannot last
without these dear friends next I have
something else that I cannot live with
that batiste dry hair shampoo and this
is just the one in original but I have
used the tropical one and oh my god it
smells like coconut and pineapple my
true favorite mixtures of smells and yet
it works amazingly if you've got some if
you have like second day kind of oily
hair and you don't have time to wash it
just spray this little buddy in and it
sorts it all out
on to fake town been trying out this
other fake tan I'm tan HQ a fake tan for
a little bit it comes in regular and
dark but I just wanted to try regular
for one so I just used this tan when I
don't smell like a nice glowing natural
not too hectic orange lead arc brown so
tan the nice tropical scent sort of
thing it applies really nicely and it's
brown it's not orange that's what I like
about it I just apply it with a mint
which it comes with it dries quickly it
smells good and yeah I don't know what
else to say it's good 10 that is what
I've been using this month next up for
skincare this month I've been using two
different um brands of face washes just
to test some out I started using of the
Bri skincare and one of my favourite
products that I have is this one it is
the B or a deep pore charcoal cleanser
just a really nice cleanser obviously
you can see how much I've used already
and I actually had two of these I gave
one tomorrow and I asked her how she
liked him she's been loving it too um
when you put on your skin you can just
really feel it working its way in and
the charcoal kind of like heats up and
it just feels so nice on your face and
it really has helped clear up my skin
quite a bit this month I've been loving
that another set of skin care that I've
been trying out is the I think you say
by oxa di-pi the Aqsa dear cosmetics and
I am in love with this packaging for
this for these cosmetics is so IKEA it's
like a nice little pastel pink packaging
and I have the cleansing gel and also
the rapid repair captivating skincare so
that's kind of like the moisturizer and
both of these are just really nice
products the cleanser just kind of I
don't know it just makes my skin feel
really nice it clears it well sort of
think it's just like your average sort
of cleanser but it's not like it doesn't
make my skin feel oily or too dry it
just balances it all out really nicely
and same with the moisturizer it's not
oily which is what I hate about some
moisturizers they just make my skin feel
oily it's a really lightweight
moisturizer and it's just good I just
really like it let's move on sleep to
some really random stuff that I've just
been liking and I thought I would show
you guys I'll show you this necklace
that I've been loving I'm eating a lot
of new jewellery this month and a lot of
people ask me like we're doing
my Jojo Jimenez cannot talk my jewelry
from and I've just been stocking up on
some new jewelry lately I would go
through and show your hips it but I
think I'm actually gonna do a jury a
jewelry collection video soon but my
main favorite of this month has been my
new it is a shell choker necklace so
pretty much it just has all these carry
shells stitched into it it's all
handmade and it's amazing and then
there's just like tassel ties and has
little shells on the end so you just
kind of like you know put it you can
wear it like down lower or you can wear
it as a choker which looks awesome like
depending on what you're wearing kind of
thing I got this from Gretel and Dexter
which is just an amazing store it's
based in Brisbane and they have an
online store - I hope they're still
listed below and where you can get some
of their jewelry because it is beautiful
I see a lot of youtubers kind of like
say what's their favorite food and like
music this month so I just sort of do
the same my favorite little snack food
this month this is just toasted coconut
chips I used to get another brand this
is the Mackenzies ones and they're
pretty much just like little dried
coconut chips they taste like heaven I
love coconut and so this is just like
such a yummy thing to snack on but then
you press the bag the smell of coconut
as that comes out it's like I like I
could just sit here all day and easy I
could eat the whole bag right now and
there's a lot in your life and for music
panic I don't just have like one
favorite song this month I've like I
changed a lot but I like they didn't
like my get to know me video a lot of my
favorite music is posted on my
soundcloud so I'll leave that linked
below if you want to check out the music
that I listen to and follow it but yet
my favorite music this month would
definitely have to be Angus &amp;amp; Julia
stones and you album like all the songs
in it I'm on Spotify and I've got it up
and it's just the best
okay enough of that um I asked a
question on Twitter I just like post a
little tweet like gonna like adding a
little segment of like questions like
what is your favorite insert object or
thing here and I got some questions so
one of them was who is your favorite
youtuber at the moment I have quite a
few favorite youtubers but one that I've
been loving lately who is my good pal
good buddy

pumpkin pie

famous girls that's really hot and has
all these followers because she's hot if

eyebrows more than I do and like this is

little favourites video just a little
update so this video I think is being
posted I think I'll have it up o
Thursday I post this video I'm actually

so just like bear with me because I've
cued these videos so when I get back
