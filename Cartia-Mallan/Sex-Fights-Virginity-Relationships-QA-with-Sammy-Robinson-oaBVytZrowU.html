get a bit hot and messy on our date I do
all this mini bar I like to get yeah I
like having a gun I'd shoot bullet I'm
just careful what you're about to show
you feet if they get out why how what do
you think is sweetest thing I can do oh
yeah why I really like it when they do
random acts of kindness yeah and you're
right they're not expected like it I
don't like it when they do something
wrong and they bring me flowers I'm like
like look at your leg bringing me
flowers because you know you fucked up
grow if I literally am just out of
nowhere I'm not even turning up on a
date with - I have no way you come over
and they just bring me a bunch of hours
I'm like it's all like something that
you know that it's not the person line
yeah if a guy knows it
I love marvelous creations and you just
randomly brought over my logic
predictions I would just like you
without nothing attached literally like
even if the guy just sends me a photo of
a cat and goes I feel like you'd make
you really happy right now
like yeah I'm so true actually that's
really clink I'm such a simple person
when it comes that stuff like I think I
really appreciate what people remember
the things that met me like really yeah
see I thought I'd get a bit shot like
I'm really bad at receiving things I'm
not good at resolving it oh good
so if someone just walked out with
flowers me I'd be like oh it made a lot
your job I'm really bad at receiving so
you're like okay I was like in my heart
I'm like wow it really means a lot
look this tyrant Katya Katya Katya
correct yeah random acts of kindness I
think a nice yeah and what about
formation I think it's really beautiful
when dying but you're really beautiful
I'm like I know it's a ulnar ability is
like the sweetest thing yeah for me and
a guy if a guy can just speak really
open it honestly and allurement I'm like
yeah even if I get like oh yeah I think
it's just fun nice to know what's one
song it's mine hundred so they just
don't like oh shit yeah yeah I agree
I hate I hate it when they try to act
too cool like I like a little bit of
like me so like but like I like I like
it when they also say if they if I don't
like mean I like cause I can't like oh
yeah powerful how him like know what you
want to get what you want hun stop being
a bitch about it
yeah bit to be it is just about here
what do you find most attractive if
you're just specifically going off looks
just if it looks dark hair dark pages
I'm definitely into brunette
a bit of like literally darkness some
little like mysterious the evil do
obviously nine thighs is good but like I
I'm not possible to hold below eyebrow
and I think yes I like that like a
beautiful I love me too like bit scruffy
kind of looking tall is always nice but
yeah that's about my only type just a
few tall and just something interesting
about you like a bit something unique
about yoga I like unique looking people
kept all because I a six foot so I need
it to be taller like my it needs to be
told
yeah like doing small isn't it cute you
like yeah I generally don't feel that
way and personality that's know if
you're just judging our personality
confidence so oh not arrogance confident
it's so hard to find like the line
between the two but confidence is to be
hottest thing I don't like when people
like am i oh yeah like all about its
barest about that Hajduk I mean I didn't
know how much I don't judge anything you
say just do anything it isn't funny like
everyone over things all that stuff like
I was having some house now I'm like
wait then what I'm really confident I
don't think about I'm like they didn't
even know nothing like but it makes you
feel comfortable I love like personality
wise definitely like the confidence
funny and someone that I think is for me
like I love guys that are in touch with
their feelings like I like to have
really these combos like there's nothing
more stimulating really I couldn't care
how attractive you all like if you can
have like a really like vulnerable
intelligent like philosophical combo
with me and they're like oh like make me
think about things in a different
and then I think challenge you like
challenge me mentally yeah then it's
really like amazing we got a personality
we just couldn't just jump be rockin I
like people that come one from the
states and communicate yeah yeah Mike
don't let tell me that continue to do
the same thing over and over
listen to it take it on board and change
it's not that hard to learn go okay
what are your deal-breakers have a
dating guide what will make it me like I
don't like a person of no more selfish
if you're going to be in a relationship
or even being with another person you
cannot be a selfish it absolutely
becomes the two of you know yes yourself
and it's like same goes for your friends
and stuff but right when you're in a
relationship with a guy like you need to
know that it's like there's two people
two people is the way that they feel the
way that they want to go about things I
don't break this to me it's just like if
you just do the same thing over in it
like if you don't learn from mistakes
and I like if you don't I think put in
the same amount of effort the other
person is putting in like if someone is
giving you their time and energy like
it's like in friendships relationships
whatever like if you can't meet that
person in the middle and stop wasting
their time don't like to do I just don't
mind yeah it's like if you don't use
areas putting all the effort in and you
don't want to reciprocate then just make
them spend lots of time and energy on
you fucking time he I don't like lies I
do not like wise oh my god I don't like
secrecy I'm like I'm very hard pin it on
this person like I wouldn't know
everything like yeah whether it's good
bad or in between like yeah I'm really
weird
like tell me everything that I don't get
weeded out by yeah asking about who of
you like how many of you learn you start
with who what's their names I just want
to know it yeah hey I don't like having
like two it's good to be your own
individual person and then complement
each other but when it comes to living
completely separate lives I hate them
yeah no definitely not
um when did you lose your virginity
Shane I oh my god really Wow I need
something writing yeah because I was
really I think I was 15
Wow I know you're a baby that's like I
was Sunday oh my god I could I was
around like evil boys going up yeah see
I wasn't I had a job yeah like my
experience with guys from my own right
who's not the most pleasant but that's
fine we learn we grow have you ever had
a one-night stand I have they're really
not that fun in the moment you think
it's on and then you wake up and you're
like oh my god I couldn't even imagine
having to leave a stranger's house or
have them likewise I'm really terrible
let's see like friends but like but even
though it's even is like oh my god what
did we just do that falls generally I
feel like you'd be kind of drunk what
happened yeah but then you'd wake up
sober and just like I find that the most
I'm punctual with me not that I really
do that anymore but like yeah do you
prefer single life or being in a
relationship being in a relationship I
as you guys know I haven't never been in
a relationship but I have dated quite a
lot of people that it feels pretty much
like you know I've been in a
relationship it's like not labeled but
yeah
I've dated a lot I've been in like very
intense emotional and like physical
things and I find that when I was doing
that in that face I was like god I could
never imagine any relationship
it definitely wasn't on the cops me I
liked my like individuality I like my
freedom because I was like so busy and I
was like building life I was young as
well when you're used to that as well
yeah it's like I and there was used to
being in a relation I think this thing
that for me was like I also he was like
loving getting to know myself I knew
myself so I was never about to settle
any one that I thought was less than
like incredible yeah like I didn't I
wanted to settle for a boring thing yeah
so but now I feel like because of my job
because my life is so hectic yeah
I find myself craving just like not a
relationship but just somehow just one
person that I'm like you know cause like
I don't I don't date really as much
anymore like I just like I spend most my
time with friends although so it's not
important to me to have random sex yeah
random date it's like I just like that
comfortability of stability of someone
that you can go and have fun with yo do
that with but in saying that not at the
like not at the level of having to being
a full time long-term committed
relationship unless yeah it gets that
point and yet to be exciting for me I
get too nervous I get bored easily just
yeah
if someone doesn't challenge me and
awful like excite me then I'm scared of
it but like you know I think it's also
just I'm growing up and learning like
how to be open to a relationship for
someone that's never being really closed
off to being committed to someone for me
yeah we're very opposite say I'm more
used to being in a relationship so like
for me being single is I'm tough like
I've always thrived offing by myself I
love my life yeah so I can totally find
being single I'm more used to being in a
relationship so when I am single I just
don't and I don't have I love having
that person that can come home to well
so like I feel like I don't have a setup
like yeah that's my point you always
have a get into relationship just too
close you won't know what a relationship
that's why I put off this so long and
ones like and this is one thing I've
spoken about my tumblr a lot like how
are you how do you be okay being single
yeah I think for us like we're lucky
because we've got a passion were like
it's definitely good to have something
that you're really good you drive off so
then you can take enjoy matter
you want it you want a relationship as
opposed to like adding extra stress or
extra time or extra pain in your life
it's supposed to come from anyways yeah
I never get into a relationship thinking
like oh my god worrying about a person
they're like you want some of that you
can kind of combine your life with event
you know it depends on what you're doing
and what what your interview but I think
for me I need someone that can keep up
with my schedule that we can do work
together I also want to get into a real
like you want to make sure it's the most
important thing I think is that you're
both two individuals you know genuinely
just complement each other slice as
opposed to two individuals that are
really really craving how many other
person and putting every part of you
into that person yeah power away like
actually you know like it's you need to
be each individual yeah because if it
all falls to shit you want to hope that
you can't leave you can't depend your
happiness in another no I'm fully I'm
not generally what happens to a lot of
people they fall into relationships and
they put every inch of man I mean us
into that person it was on their life
don't ever settle for something that's
anything short of like absolutely
amazing because yeah if you're bored at
the fucking start it's only gonna get
more become any mo morning good cranky
is stuck with the one person I know and
I don't get into relationship thinking
all the Oh doing for a few months like
there's no way to do it yeah don't ever
lead someone on like that the other
person can genuinely a little bit see I
truly just won't go time I love to go up
the girls here for the girls I just love
me dude I literally mind my favorite
quote that I've ever said in my whole
entire life was I think I'll never fall
in love because no one will ever love me
more than I love myself that's actually
it doesn't work because you're so
depending on that unlike feeling
validation from that other person melody
itself don't let another person tell you
I know it sounds easy but quinoa counted
cuz it's the best feeling yeah it looks
very short I love me I usually love you
subduing this water because it's just
gonna help me like digest oh we have a
scholar come on Cheers
champion

somebody's mommy's calling yeah wait and
