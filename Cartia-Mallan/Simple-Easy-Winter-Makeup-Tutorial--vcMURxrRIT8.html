pry my face to help my foundation go on
and stay on for longer my hair was
really annoying me so I was quickly
decided to pull it up and then I'll keep
going on with this tutorial with my Make
Up For Ever HD foundation and my Sigma
flat top kabuki brush I'm going to be
lightly buffing this into my face you
have a nice flawless finish
with my mac prolongwear concealer I'm
putting this underneath my eyes to give
a nice highlight and also to conceal the
bags then since I'm too lazy to blend
this in with my fingers I'm taking my
tapered Sigma brush and just lightly
petting this into my skin
now with my mac powder foundation I will
be applying this all over the face to
set the makeup and to give a nice matte
finish then I'm just feeling in my
eyebrows really quickly kind of skipping
over this step because everyone does
this differently now that I've done my
face and my eyebrows let's move on to
the eyes taking my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre and lightly priming my eyelids now
I'm making sure I apply this all the way
up to the brow bone because we will be
applying my shadow up there too
I'm taking a white eyeshadow and
applying this all over the lid to give a
nice base coat
now either take a lot brown eyeshadow or
what I'm doing is taking that powder
foundation that I use which is quite a
tan color
I'm lightly applying this to the crease
with a brush and just slowly building up
the color then to make sure there's no
harsh lines I'm taking my fluffy
blending brush and blending it all out
then I always keep going back with that
lighter color and applying it to the
base and I blend it again and then apply
the light color so just keep going back
and doing this as you're doing the look
then with his pencil eye shadow brush
I'm taking a dark brown color to him my
lower lash line and then taking that
white color again and highlighting my
brow bone and then with my liquid
eyeliner I am lining my eyes and also
adding a nice little wing on to the end
there
then I'm going to be applying a stack of
mascara to my top and bottom lashes this
will really finish up the look nicely
and open up your eyes a lot
taking my Mac matte bronzer I'm going to
be defining my cheekbones and warming up
my face a little bit
I don't want any grouse lines on my face
so just make sure you blend it all out
with a powder fat and powder face a
powder face brush and then taking my
peachy keen blush from Mac I will be
applying this to the apples of my cheek
to have a nice rosy look
um then with my soft and gentle
highlighter from Mac I'm taking this on
my Sigma highlighting brush and applying
this just above my cheekbones
now that all of that is John let's move
on to the lips then I'm taking my
favorite lip color at the moment which
is rebel by Mac it is the most perfect
winter tone and it goes with so many
different things and it really is
perfect for this look I'm just applying
this all over my lips straight from the
actual lipstick and then going in
afterwards with some concealer and
cleaning up the edges so there we have
it that is the final look this is
everything all together so much to me
