actual makeup videos I'm so sorry that
it's been so long I've just been
completely non-stop over the holidays
and I'm back at school and everything is
just so super crazy but I'm going to try
my hardest to get more makeup videos and
more proper me talking to film videos
out soon but today I filmed for you my
Valentine's Day makeup look now this
probably isn't like most of the ones
that you may have seen on YouTube so far
I tried to keep it more neutral and a
little bit more like realistic because I
was going on a date for Valentine's Day
I probably wouldn't be wearing like
crazy line or in lashes and red lips and
nothing too nuts but this one is kinda
more realistic very daytime date wear or
like just casual but hopefully I can try
and maybe film one more makeup tutorial
that's a bit more glam for you guys that
want to wow your men on a date but if
you do want to see how I achieve this
makeup look then please keep watching
stop I'm starting by putting on my
makeup forever primer and this will help
all of the makeup stay on it for longer
then I'm taking my concealer and putting
this on all of my problem areas and I
had lots of pimples coming through when
I filmed this pretty gross so just
excuse that putting it under my eyes and
all over other part of my face and then
tapping it in with my Sigma tapered
brush then taking my L'Oreal Lumi and my
bronzing BB cream buy in aqsa I'll just
be buffing this into my skin with my
Sigma flat top kabuki brush
then with my Mac Studio Fix powder and
my real take things powder brush I'm
going to be putting this all over my
face to set the foundation and then with
my Smashbox duo brow kit I'm just going
to be filling in my eyebrows and then
setting them in place with my benefit
gimme brow taking my sleek contour kit
I'm going to be taking the two like
bronzy colors and just bronzing up my
face and get me a little bit more
definition and then with my Mac I'm
blush in the color dainty I'm going to
be tapping this onto the apples of my
cheeks and dragging it up a little bit
too into highlight I'm taking Mac soft
and gentle with this light shimmer shade
from my chocolate bar palette I'm going
to be applying this as a base color for
all the rest of the eyeshadow then with
this L'Oreal little quad I'm taking the
two middle pink colors and just blending
this all over my lid doesn't really have
to be too neat it's just a really nice
light dust then with this darker purple
color I'm taking a different blending
brush and applying this to the outer
crease and blending it up just like I
did with the other color going back to
the chocolate bar palette I'm taking
this light shimmer shade and applying it
to my brow bone as a nice little
highlight just add more shimmer and then
with a brown eyeliner pencil I'm
smudging this underneath my lash line
and also really messily on top I'm going
to be then be going back with my finger
and blending this a lot to give it a
really smoky effect with my next shimmer
roll-on I'm putting a tiny bit on and
just blending it out across my lid to
give extra a little bit of sparkle and
glam to the look this is really simple
then with this Stila smudge stick I'm
going to be highlighting my inner
corners
mascara I'll be taking my Too Faced
better than sex and applying this all
over my lashes and really really coating
them since I'm not putting on any black
eyeliner taking politely pink we're
putting this on my lips just because
it's a really beautiful shimmery pink
tone this is the completed makeup look I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
hope y'all have an absolutely amazing
Valentine's Day no matter what you're
getting up to I just wanted to quickly
say before I go because this will be my
next video uploaded thank you thank you

filming right now and it is a Monday and
I was at school when I checked and I
literally was just there like what this
is just crazy so I thank you all from
the bottom of my heart it means the
absolute world to me and I'm so excited
and I love you all thank you for that
and I don't even know what else to say
I'm gonna stop now before I start
getting a pony and yeah but it means a
lot to me and I love you all so much but
I hope you'll enjoy my little
Valentine's Day video and I'm sorry
about the lighting in this video that's
kind of like bright and then dark and
then bright and dark I'm filming late in
the afternoon like after school and it
is the most butthole la weather because
it kind of goes like sunny and then dog
that's something that dogs the Sun
setting bad all right
forgive me please also quickly again
before I go I really need you guys to
help me out I'm going for a bit of a
stage where I'm like what am I doing
with my channel what do I want it to be
what do you guys want it to be so if you
could please in the comments leave down
below if you want to see more vlogs or
if you want to see well I'll keep
obviously doing well it's not the same
any question I know you guys like the
vlogs you'll tell me and I love making
the blogs they're personally my favorite
I think when I did the vlogs you guys
can really see what I get up to and like
really my personality and I can kind of
show more of me through that and it's so
much more fun for me
so gloves will be stay but more so in
regards to makeup videos and like other
videos like I was thinking because you
guys all ask me a lot a lot of messages
asking for advice on different stuff so
I get some about fashion about makeup
and a lot about body issues a lot of our
schooling life in general I don't know
whether it's stuck for memory some
advice videos or more makeup videos on
my fashion videos like clothing and
stuff or just general like lifestyle
videos that would mean the world to me
if you could leave your what you want
your quests below and I'll try and
follow through there if meet you guys
one have a wonderful week everyone and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
