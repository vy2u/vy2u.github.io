I'm just going to be doing like a super
super chilled out Q&amp;amp;A because lately I
have been getting absolutely just
bombarded on my tumblr with all sorts of
really good valid questions and I was so
like instead of me just like typing
these out 20 million times I'm going to
sit down and make a video so I out some
snapchat if you guys to ask me some
questions on my tumblr which is just yem
take over tumblr calm so I'm gonna go
follow me on there I have been using
that so much more often and it's
honestly like been a really nice thing I
never used to use it very much because I
just got a lot of like people saying
dumb stuff that really pissed me off so
I kind of stopped using it for a while
and then I kind of got back on that
because I wanted to be posting um photos
that I was taking on a film and then
this really awesome kind of community of
people just like float in I never ever
know what to start with on in Q&amp;amp;A type
what are some things you look for /
value in people the best things and
values that I look for in people when I
become friends with them or am close
with people or just people in general
acquaintances I really love when people
are open-minded they can kind of like
flow with different ideas or different
thoughts and not just people that are
just like closed off to different things
and like new experiences I look for
people that are creative kind of think
the same way as me are into the same
sort of things it's always nice to have
friends at a like-minded you kind of can
bounce ideas off each other and you just
can flow really well because you can
totally be yourself and you can still do
stuff that you love with your friends
I definitely look for people that are
honest and not afraid to speak their
mind I don't like people that will hold
back on something if they're like
something's really pissing them off hate
if they don't just like speak up I love
people that will stand their ground for
something they believe in number one and
also something that might be irritating
them or something I'm doing I hate it
when people just mad at me and I'm like
why you mad at me like what about done
and just tell me kind of thing I love
when people can just kinda like call me
up on things when I'm playing up or um
can openly tell me how they feel about
something when people are like that
it can be up front and say something to
you it literally reduces arguments and
fights by
100% because you can just look like
blowed it out to each other I absolutely
like that is my one thing I hate
conflict I hate bad energy I hate having
like awkward tension or bad vibes or
someone it'll literally like if I ever
have that with someone it'll stay in my
mind for the whole day the whole week
until it's resolved it just is like this
like gross thing that just like kind of
eats away at me I hate it okay here's
one question that has been asked
supposed to many times a little
background information if you don't know
I got a tattoo on my ankle the other
week when I was in Byron it's just a
sticking point tattoo which you
literally just take a needle and you dip
it into ink and then you just poke it
into your foot it sounds as unpleasant
as it feels um but yeah I got one of
them and I got a W on my ankle I've
literally gotten about thirty question
saying why did you get a W on your foot
what does the W stand for what is this
what is this W I would you go to W that
is Soren and what does that mean and
true it's a pretty random letter to get
the W on my foot stands for the name
Wendy that is the name of my auntie she
passed away I think about three years
now three two or three years now I'm so
bad at keeping track but pretty much
auntie Wendy that is my dad sister Oh
getting all choked up she was pretty
much like as I was growing up she was my
best friend like the one person I could
kind of go to for advice for things or
talk to about staff and it was really
weird I was so young but it kind of felt
like she treated me like an adult in the
same way like we were on like the same
level type of thing we were just besties
and I just absolutely adored her
everything about her was just incredible
the most incredible woman I wish she was
still around like like literally get her
in a YouTube video with me I'd be the
greatest thing ever
unfortunately she passed away she had
lung cancer and it's definitely very
hard losing her especially for my mom
and for me and all of the family because
she was just kind of like the rock in
the family and like she was just
hilarious and we're so like in so many
ways and she was just so out there and
just you know but everyone loved her she
was like honey when it was just the most
loved person so um yeah I always said to
myself like if I ever get a tattoo I
always like one day I definitely want to
get it w you never have many family
members have passed away but I always
feel like her energy around me I
constantly she's almost like my little
guardian angel and I would say like it
always feels like she's kind of with me
so I just thought if there was one thing
I would like to ink on my skin that can
be there forever that would be a w-2
represent any Wendy so that's the
meaning behind my little foot tattoo and
I show this is what it looks like if you
can see it's really hard to get my foot
in in such a position my legs are really
hairy too by the way don't mind them
getting them waxed next week we've got a
growth map nice long wins okay love it
um actually don't know how to do this
there's a little W there Oh have you
ever met someone you shared an instant
bond with yes um totally there is one
person in my life that I shared the
quickest fun with you guys will know her
her name's yeah so she's my best friend
she's now in New York you feel like kind
of new to my channel she recently moved
to New York to go to an acting school
and I miss her dearly we Skype a lot
though but I think it was really crazy
when he has an iron sort of first hung
out properly it was just like this weird
I don't even know how like I would
explain it it's just like we just look
at each other and we just everything we
just got it it was like we thought the
same way we just knew what was up we
could honestly speak to each other about
anything and I'm it's so weird I mean I
remember like after like the first day
of hanging out with her I had like her
inner monologue in my head literally
like I would speak and I feel like I
just would hear her voice in my head it
was just like I was yes and she was
Kylie the same thing happened her she
was like legitimately it's when I
speak it's you in my head it's crazy
like how instantly we just bonded
because we are so so like we have the
same values we just have the same
opinion on a lot of things and one thing
that we bond over is like our insane
like if you guys watch the girlfriend
tag you'll just like realize how insane
both of us are we just can go do
whatever the we want to do together
like nothing like anything kind of goes
like it's honestly really fun we have
the exact same guy type so it's so funny
every time like there's a guy it will
let's just get it like we do we just I
don't I don't know I'm getting at
missing yeses let talk about them so
excited because she's actually a little
update for you guys that have been
followers you know who has isn't staff
and you're dedicated to the core she's
coming home in a month or so for Falls
festival so she's going to be at Falls
so I am so ridiculously excited we're
kind of already like planning out our
little outfits sorting out stuff and
we're just I just can't wait to party
with her again like that song misses we
have to go out and party with gas
because we always have so much fun
together
oh god I miss her so much hi as hope New
York's going well she's watching this
and she's probably right now she's
probably crying I can see like a little
tear in her eye are you ever going to
dye your hair a different color or get
your septum pierced because you said in
a video that you would and you would
look so good with it thank you
I'm so bad I always like get really
excited say I'm going to like do
something crazy like I honestly thought
I was getting it my septum pierced and
then all my friends like you get so
annoyed at the littlest thing like on
your face and stuff you'll die with a
set themselves like okay I'm not getting
in a septum pierced because I can easily
just like putting on a fake one so I
didn't do that what I am very much so I
know I said that I say this but I'm
actually dead set about this one I think
I'm gonna get a fringe like a proper
like little box friend how do you even
demonstrate it like a friend you know
one of those things yeah yeah I really
just want to do something in my hair
because I'm so bored with how it is at
the moment probably any get frustrated
with the fringe but that is okay because
I'm trying but with you and yeah what
was one of your most defining moments in
life that's a big one I've had many many
things happen in my life kind of been
like big big defining moments for me as
a growing teenager I know I like you
guys kind of pick up on I've been
getting like you might tell me I get
lots of questions being like I've
definitely seen you grow as a person and
grow more into yourself we can tell
through your content or your photos type
thing which is so true it like it's
really easy to tell my life change as
I've grown off because it's all been
posted online
it's definitely really cool Canada
follow that but I think honestly the
biggest thing that's kind of helped me
grow into the person and being the
biggest defining moment was kind of when
like it's so cliche it's sort of weird
and I don't know how it kind of happened
at the place it did happen but it's just
been going to music festivals and
getting to know the friends that I've
now friends with and kind of cutting out
the people that were toxic for me just
not actually good friend
yes really just around Splenda last year
time I've talked about it I think you
like lots of times in videos but it was
the biggest defining factor for me was
that first music festival that I went to
experiencing that it's just like crazy
like these people that were there and
like this big scale event and how it had
such a personal impact for me and the
person that I was at the time and it
kind of made me just like totally
reevaluate my life and the way that I
was living it and why I was living in
touch away and I guess the different
views that I had I'm thinking about it I
was such a negative person not negative
just like I just like ridiculous like
just get worried about stupid stuff or
like my motives were just not in the
right spot or the badness of myself and
I was in no place that I even like cared
about personal growth or anything like
that but yet after splinter last year I
kind of that was massive after that it
just was like whoa like my style change
my perspective my mindset my Drive my
ambitions everything was just kind of
like the moment when I was like I'm not
living life the to the fullest as I
could be I think the real truth was that
splendor was the most fun I've ever had
in my whole entire life and I was like
why can I do this all the time
like why don't I do this all the time
and I'm in it I splendas not on like
every day of the year but you can
actually duplicate the fun that you had
at such an event and use it in normal
life and do it like have that much fun
with other things I don't know like it
was crazy it was just the biggest
defining moment for me next to quests
you know that's not as not as day
been ridiculous as I have been do you
have any exciting things planned for the
near future
any adventurous weekends where YouTube
related things anything really
yes I certainly do okay I'm like
touching myself as I said yes I have so
much exciting stuff I compete you just
sitting here I'm so excited I'm going
all today's date is it's Tuesday the
13th of October so I'm not I don't know
like when I'm editing and uploading this
next Wednesday so that is the 21st of
October I'm going to Sydney so I'm

photo shoot chance for a magazine to

Oh calm down Kyle um tips for becoming
vegan and what has your journey becoming
vegan being like so far are you still
ready to turn or you know for being it
okay there's like three questions in
there I'll start with the end one I've
kind of touched on it a little bit that
yes I am becoming a vegan I'm at the
moment I'm like full vegetarian
have any meat for quite some time I've
just really been cutting out most meat
products to be truthful I didn't just do
that overnight I kind of actually
unconsciously I've just been cutting up
meat for quite some time I've just been
limiting how much I've been eating I
haven't actually for almost a year or
two now I only drink soy milk so I'm
actually not a very big dairy person
besides when I eat yogurt or cheese and
stuff in regards to becoming vegan now I
would probably definitely consider
myself a full vegan it's definitely been
a lot easier than I thought it would be
I guess probably helpful for me because
I was already quite a clean eater and I
already didn't actually consume very
much dairy or meat products the only
thing that is a little tricky for me is
eggs because I really loved eggs like on
my avocado toast but um you know what I
will be just fine there's plenty of
other nutritious and yummy foods
substitute my eggs for I am and just
shocked at how easy it has been and how
many yummy food options there are and
how easy it is to still eat out with
friends but my main tip would probably
be take your time with it there's no
rush to just jump into it I mean for
some people it may work better to just
do it overnight and cut out everything
for me it took a little more time I
guess just to kind of like I wanted to
educate myself more on what veganism was
why was I doing it and the benefits of
being a vegan actually initially went
into wanting to become a vegan just for
health reasons we often feel quiet
clogged up and sick anyways when I eat
meat and milk and stuff and I just I
just wanted something that was healthier
for my body um for weight loss for
health for skin for just all-around
bodily feeling I'm very much a person
that if my body feels off I just it
affects my mood and I hate that so I
want to feel good a lot of the time and
energized um and then I guess as I kind
of started going more into it it became
very much about the ethical and kind of
social and all the other like stuff to
do with meat production and animal
product production if that makes sense
yeah it just I don't know it it totally
changed my minds you about and I guess
the conditions that these animals are
living
in a so unsanitary and like you don't
actually know what they're being fed you
know the way that they're being killer
lives like left it out for hours and
days just to like lay there kind of
thing so then I thought about in the way
if I'm really into my health side of my
body then I'm putting this into my body
and then is so not good for my body and
then it's so not nice the animals and
it's also doing horrible things for our
ecosystem absolutely major pollution to
the air and stuff and not to get all
that massive rain honey I'm just kind of
telling you what I learned and how it's
just kind of changed my mind to do about
it and I'm so happy that I've done this
I guess a lot of people always sort of
say like how do you do that like how
could you cut bacon or chocolate and
stuff and um I think people instantly
think about that side first and think I
was going to be hard I can't be bothered
doing it but it really is not actually
hard coming from someone that loves food
I freaking love bacon and I love I used
to love eating all that stuff um and I
guess just like one side edge ik ated
myself I was like I don't even need it
like it's we have so much other stuff we
humans have it just so greedy that we
need everything it's just one less thing
that I don't need if it helps my body
feel better if it helps the environment
if it helps animals if it just helps out
a little bit then I'm more than happy to
jump on board and do it so I'm so happy
I made a choice and I feel great for it
and um I'm excited to learn more but I
just want to say just upfront and
quickly I don't want to be bombarded
with questions about vegan is there just
because I'm no health food professional
I don't even know that much about it I'm
just kind of like yeah okay I'll cut out
animal products and like everything like
that my channel is still going to be
travel videos and beauty and fashion
it's not going to become like a massive
vegan channel like I'm not the next
essena o'neill kind of person who's like
really into just the food and fitness
stuff obviously I guess the more I get
into it I probably want to share like
some recipes that I'm doing and I'm more
than happy to do that I just please
don't go asking me too many questions
about what you should be eating and what
you shouldn't be and letting other
because I just I don't know I simply do
not know
I mean if anyone is a vegan wants to
give me tips more than happy bombard me
with hits the tips send me some messages
on tumblr and stuff I'm always more than
happy to learn more okay I feel like who
I've been talking for a very long time
like I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'm sorry I did my classic
freaking went on a rant about something
again I boys it up but I mean think
sometimes it might actually good you
guys can get to know me better get to
know my point of view of things better
and it might inspire you to do things
differently I was getting sleepy like as
I'm sitting here I'm like thinking about
food and I'm thinking about sleep and
I'm thinking about watching something on
Netflix but like I've watched so much
stuff on Netflix that I'm running out of
like options and it's really stressful
so I sauce a massive thank you for
watching this video and thank you for
all supporting me
this long I'm almost at 200 K which is
actually freaking crazy it is ridiculous
and it is very exciting for me to be
reaching such a massive milestone I just
love the fact that more people are
jumping on board and I kind of like
enjoying my content I think that's the
most rewarding thing is that people
genuinely like enjoying the videos I'm
posting like whether it's a usual like
sit-down YouTube video or more of like
my creative type things it absolutely
makes me so happy and excited that you
guys like them because that's why that's
how passionate I'd love to make and if
it hopefully inspires you guys a little
bit or anything it just it's awesome it
makes me so happy
so I'm saying let's love out to my
existing family any of my new family
members that have jumped on board
because happy to have you guys here is
super exciting and yeah I'm just I talk
way way too much that is a weakness
I don't ever freaking shut up anyways
