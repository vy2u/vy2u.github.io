focusing on their eyes I've already gone
ahead and it done my face makeup now if
you'd like to see how I contoured and
highlighted my face just click on the
video right there so I'm already started
with one eye but I'm going to be priming
my eyes with my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre then I'm just applying a white
eyeshadow all over the lid now this is
gonna help form a really nice gradient
kind of smokey eye for the look and also
help the gold colors really pop then I'm
just taking some tape now this is
optional I just like to do this to put
on the outer corner of my eye to help
get a nice shape I'm blending in this
brown color and a purpley shade matte
color and defining my crease with a
large fluffy brush then I'm taking this
eye contour brush and this really nice
dark brown color to further define the
crease even more and just darken up
those colors
now it's so important while doing this
makeup look that you continuously keep
blending out the eyeshadows so there's
no harsh lines I've gone ahead and
applied a light shimmery eyeshadow to
highlight the inner corner and then for
the main part I'll be applying this
really gorgeous pigmented gold eye
shadow to add a little bit of elegance
to this look I think it's perfect for
any special occasion and I just think it
looks really nice then once I've taken
off the tape I'm blending everything all
together once again and then with that
contouring brush I'm just fixing up the
shape of the darker eyeshadows with this
other gold color I'm gonna go back and
Pat this where I've put the other gold
color as well just to really make it pop
to highlight my brow bone I'm taking the
white eyeshadow I used in the very first
step to really define all of the colors
on my lid and bring it all together
I've lined my waterline with this black
crayon liner and then for that perfect
prom or formal or any special occasion
makeup look I've gone ahead and lined my
eyes in a winged out cut eyeliner
formation just to make the eyes really
come together and I think it's just
really gorgeous on anyone and it suits
this look perfectly if you like you can
do what I've done and go ahead and put
the tape back on to use as a guideline
to make sure that your eyeliner is
perfectly straight
taking a brown eyeshadow I'm applying
this to my bottom lash line
and then to really open up my eyes I'm
applying a stack of mascara to the top
and bottom lashes
and finally for their eyes I've gone
ahead and added some really nice false
lashes just to finish off the look
completely now if you do want to see how
I apply these I'll leave the link down
below to my video where I show how to
apply false lashes and then to blend the
lashes and my real eyelashes all
together just apply some mascara there
I'm going back with my bronzer to define
my cheeks once again because some of the
colors come off and for a really nice
natural bronzer color I'm applying my
Mac warm Sol blush just to the apples of
my cheeks and a little bit up near my
temples then finally I'm taking my
highlighter and applying it to just sort
of above where we put the blush and you
can also add a little bit to your chin
nose and forehead for an extra glowy
look for lipstick I'm taking this really
nice rose pink color to my lips just for
no I think it's perfect for this look
it's neutral but it adds a bit of color
and there's still a gloss over the top
so that your face doesn't look oily in
any photos that you'll be taking on your
special day
I advise just patting a little bit of
translucent powder over the top so that
it stays matte so I hope you all enjoyed
