more rules you're gonna try to get you
to follow you just gotta keep living man
Li VI n this is a weird position this is
the way it's Jolla don't have a vlogging
camera because I lost it on my last
adventures I just kind of thought I'd
film this because 5:30 on Thursday
afternoon the what's a day the fifth of
November and I just watching my die and
I was like I have tomorrow off Saturday
Sunday off Monday and Tuesday off and I
don't really just feel like sitting
around in Brisbane doing nothing because
I mean I could be editing a video but
since Ellis my vlogging camera I lost
all the footage on my blogging camera
from my last adventure so I can't edit
that so I decided I'm going to go to
Sydney so I get a lot of questions of
people being like how do you plan your
little trips away how does it actually
work how do you like just decide you're
going to go I couldn't have done
anything like you're seeing this live
time so at the moment I'm just currently
on Webjet I'm comparing flights finding
a cheap flight to Sydney I've just put
in the date for tomorrow I kind of okay
this is what the first thing that I did
was I was like okay thinking about going
to Sydney alright let's look at more
gigs around so the first thing I looked
up I went to Oxford arts factory and
just hello look if there was any good
gigs on and what do you know one of my
favorite bands the murlocs is playing
there tomorrow night I was like oh I'm
even excited just like saying it because
I've wanted to see them for Solent oh
yeah I'm on Webjet comparing flat
see so yeah I definitely know like all I
know so far as I'm going to see them a
lot tomorrow night so I need a flat it's
going to get me there before 8 o'clock
tomorrow and then I just have got some
tickets for that show and I'll probably
come home on the Tuesday and in regards
to what I'm doing there I have no idea
after this I'm probably just gonna run
bye mum I try to do that now let's go
I'll go see what Marvis time she knows
what's going on in Sydney so just ask
her hi mum Hey
just letting you know I'm going to
Sydney tomorrow sorry
yeah yes tomorrow try like that yeah the
male locks are playing so the merlocks
yep um yeah doing work for you dip how
do you feel about having such an
adventurous daughter I'm very excited
actually never a dull moment in this
household that's for sure this camera is
so heavy
okay I'm gonna go look for my vlogging
right now because I can't go to Sydney
without it I will not be walking down
the streets cruising with this big old
thing actually before I do that I'm
gonna call some of my friends from
Wollongong and tell them that they have
to come to Sydney tomorrow night in
comfort of the geography okay that's
cool bear first
all right hello hi I'm just calling to
say um I'm coming to Sydney tomorrow oh
my god really yeah like actually and can
you guys come to a gig you have to come
I'm not even asking you're coming to a
gig tonight Cindy it's the merlocks and
they're really good it we really really
farm like really fun gig
it's at Oxford arts Factory usually I'm
$24 totally worth it
they're so good there we've so much fun
like on their website I send you the
details and stuff I asked Tom died on
he's down um I'll probably just drive up
in John back down do it I love you if
you do be so much on let's get a little
group together I know I got bored I was
just sitting here and I was like I have
five days free and I'm I'm bored so I'm
gonna comfort oh my god oh yay okay well
I'm gonna send you all the details now
and I'm gonna book my flats and stuff
and then okay yeah I'll see you tomorrow
okay all right boy it's as easy as that
people seriously overcomplicate all this
stuff people like how do I do it how do
I get stopped together you just do it
simple as that now let's go find my
vlogging camera happy and relieved say I
found my little broken vlogging camera
just a piece of advice from me um don't
leave your camera in bags full of sand
or other objects that may damage your
lens because my lens permanently like
doesn't close now and my camera is
pretty screwed up anyways got my camera
bag I have footage on this I can still
edit my video but hey everything happens
for a reason like I'm not saying prison
because I didn't have this so I didn't
have anything to edit so I was bored but
now I have stuff to edit and I go in the
city awesome great
let's book some flats okay so update on
this siege flights for tomorrow have
been booked my ticket for the merlocks
has been booked now I just need to sort
up my mess from the past month that I've
been living out of all this stuff and
then I'm good to do um I went out for
dinner before that's I'm all dressed up
okay so it spread it out and my flight
leaves at 12:55 I think I'm gonna go to
the airport quite a bit earlier just
when I can get a lift there so I'm going
to be there a bit earlier but I'm just
gonna sit down edit some videos once I'm
there but okay I want to talk you guys
through some packing tips because I
guess when you're kind of going
somewhere and you don't necessarily know
you're staying you don't know your way
of transport it's easier just to pack
lighter and sometimes I totally go
against this and I take that massive
suitcase but that's will be what I like
definitely know how to wednesday like I
know exactly where I'll be but for this
case I like I know I know I've got
somewhere to stay each night but a lot
of the places that I'm staying like far
away from each other so in this case the
best thing to be is to get like a little
mini version of a suitcase this is even
like quite big to what I sometimes take
but yeah you want a small suitcase
something that you can like wheel around
busy places catch public transport with
it's perfect but seeing as like it
doesn't fit as much well you should
probably try and plan out your outfits
this is what I do and this is how I
literally avoid over packing so like
I've got my outfit for a plane and I can
wear that skirt with this shirt and with
that shirt and with that shirt if I want
to rewear something these two outfits
and then yeah just packing stuff you can
rewear again over and over again huh but
that's repeating myself and I was gonna
keep space my laptop so I normally take
like a big handbag as well as my little
luggage bag so my big crochet bag is
always good like Mary Poppins bag it
somehow fits like everything in it that
would be my top tips for packing
okay so I managed to fit all the clothes
that I need and I actually fit a lot
more than I needed or probably should be
taking in here which is good so I'm
actually kind of running late
my laptop's in there and it just dropped
all normal I'm ready to do so also just
before I left I've looked up like bust
times and train time see which one I can
catch the bus is the cheapest so I'm
probably gonna catch that tastes like an
hour though to get to Bondi so I hope my
friend Ashton finishes work around 4:30
s and I probably end up teeing up with
her Bondi Junction so it'll be perfect
Arum yes so when it comes to transport
if you don't want to catch it
uber everywhere like I used to do that
just ends up costing way too much just a
couple of bucks you can literally ask
anyone where to go I used to be very
anxious to catch public transport city
because there's so many people like
running around doing stuff but it's
actually fun if you just you just head
straight you know where you're going you
don't really know where you're going but
you just ask people and it's always fun
everyone always seems to know where to
go and you always end up getting to a to
be just fine so yeah I've got my boss
time sorted a train time if all else
fails and I'm ready to go I'm in Sydney
I got here and sorry I didn't vlog the
plane trip it was a little bit rushed
ashin CL imma Ashton's place around
crashing tonight I'm just unpacking my
good little bag and getting ready for
tonight it's gonna put on some fresh
makeup just got and changed and then I
just listening to the mailbox now
getting ready yeah reason I have so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
