i'm back and i'm doing a whole video
i've heaps of new clothing items and i
thought i'd share with you guys I have a
few clothes from princess Polly and a
few thrifted clothing items that I got
in fire in last weekend and most of
these are kind of more summering I guess
spring type because I'm in spring at the
moment here in Australia so yes also if
you're not already subscribed go ahead
and press the little subscribe button
down there I post one to two videos a
week normally too when I'm being really
good and yeah black hole videos give
this one a thumbs up and without further
ado let's just jump straight into the
whole video if you like what I mean
there's light you can't see that I have
blush on and then I just look like I'm
kind of dead I'm gonna put on the same
blush Oh cuz why you shouldn't throw out
the brushes they come with I'm gonna
start out with the items that I've got
that are from the op shop called Empire
and I'm not sure which one it was and
seriously this is a bargain I got three
items of clothing for $11 and when you
see what I got you'll be like what so
the first thing that I got is this
awesome long like suede skirt with
tassels at the bottom it just looks like
this I was literally shocked when the
lady said that three things were love
those I thought this would have been
like 80 bucks so that's real suede it's
such good quality and it's such a nice
fit it's a size eight which I normally
wear like a size 10 or 12 in pants but
it fits really nice like a hugs around
my waist really nicely around my phone
like I already don't have enough like
suede stuff in my wardrobe let's just
add a few more pieces over there okay
the next little piece that I got from
the up shop is this really cute off the
shoulder little crop mid top things that
just sits like that
I wore this out the other night and I
haven't worn colorful really colorful
stuff like patterned colorful stuff in
so long and I'll talk to Brady outside I
start wearing more color again it feels
sorry
it's like I chucked this on with like
also a bright red high-waisted like
mid-lengths good and it just look really
cool I did feel like a bit of like a
salsa danced off but that's okay I mean
feeling like a salsa dance is awesome
and the third thing that I got is too
ugly to show on camera it's literally
just like a t-shirt that I wear to bed
so that's $11 from the up shop another
shirt that I thrifted I just got this
really cool t-shirt and the bad thing
about I have to cut off the UM they call
off of it because it's it's really funny
it looks like a rash I like that you
wear when you're little to protect you
from the Sun when you're swimming I
don't know it's like overseas you guys
pull it rash shirts - is that does
anyone else call them rashes sunny
protective shirts fade the shirt toque I
I don't know and moving on to some of
the princess fly things I picked up I
picked up so much cool stuff from
princess Polly I'm gonna start with I'm
gonna start with the pair of sunnies
that I picked up and these are from
Princess fun but they're the brand key
and I love these I used to have a pair
like this from dish they literally broke
within a week so I was like god damn it
now super cool then you can see the ring
lights right through them yeah they just
look like this then I like square that
it's like kind of round rounded square
sunnies which is like a really cool
shape that's the first thing that I got
from princess Polly and I'm excited to
wear these okay the next thing that I
got is so exciting I have to show you
guys if you guys saw my vlog from an Fez
and Sydney like the benefit thing that I
did you would have seen like Lee was
showing me her like Sophie case that
lights up well your homegirl got one so
exciting that's so cool so it just looks
like a no-life I hope it's not ugly it's
a little bit bulky but like not
ridiculously bulky it is perfectly fine
like hugs your phone nicely so I'll take
off my case and um so you just like put
it into your phone as normal it clicks
and then on the back of the case there's
like a button I just press the button
and then you have I don't know if you
can Mike's a poet so good it liked it
like lights inside of your face and then
so when you go and take a selfie they
just look awesome
it goes off now okay the next accessory
that I got from princess boy is this
really cool like silver belt just looks
like that and it's super cool I'll undo
and put it on to you guys at all where
ever you want it to be just looks like
that it actually matches really
perfectly having just like a plain so
about so easy because it can literally
go with anything and um it's just edging
it and that's cool and I really like it
I got another belt from Princess play to
it I'll show you guys there's the other
one you guys would have seen this type
of style around quite a lot but I only
ever had a black one and I had like two
different black ones and I always wanted
a brown one I love this one heaps
because it's like a deep brown on a
gross Brown it's just like a really nice
solid dark brown color like the
detailing at the end and then yeah the
next thing that I have from princess
Polly is I have two hats that I got so
this is a fallen broken straight hat
that princess Polly now stops I nearly
screamed when Lee was like when you
descend you get hot and I was like oh my
god yeah cuz I love full of broken
straight I have another hat of this
laying somewhere around and they're just
such good quality hats like and what I
love is the guardroom hat so I don't
like the fluffy ones I just they don't
suit me whatsoever so I have a pretty
small head and I got a small medium and
it just sits like perfectly it could be
a little bit tighter but I think him it
was tighter it would you'd have to
squeeze it on I don't know I think it's
just supposed to sit like this and what
I love about this is the color it's like
a lighter brown so we'll go anything
okay and the next type that I got is
this one
it's one of the sale of Steinhart one is
by the brand Brixton and this is a size
small it's kind of just like the right
size there's that super cool it's just
such a cool addition to any outfit so
the last accessory piece that I got from
princess Polly is this cute little bag I
said I'm getting everything in this Cup
I'm seriously fully matching with these
four things right now this is really
cool though this little bag because it
can being shoulder bag so he was throw
it over your shoulder or pull um little
straps down and then it becomes like a
little backpack which is super cool
because you have like two and one and it
is pretty small like it's a really small
size backpack but it's like really good
just to keep like a few little pieces in
it and be perfect like a festival when
you don't need to carry around too much
just your basics sticking with my crazy
Fein four tassels it has tassels so
you've completely sorted okay finally
afford the clothing items I picked up
from princess Polly I'm gonna start with
first my jumpsuit this is a
off-the-shoulder dongsu and it goes it
has like a waistband there but I like to
pair it with the belt just to pull it in
a bit more it goes all the way down to
the floor so it's like full-length and I
seriously and obsessed with this
jumpsuit it's so so comfortable and it's
just perfect to tuck on when you going
to the beach it can be like super casual
or really dressy you can really just do
it up however you want with accessories
or with makeup or like I've made it a
bit more casual and cool with the hat
and some rings yeah so that's the first
thing that I picked up and I'm loving
this color if you can't tell I think I
mentioned it like arrived on looks
alright the next thing that I picked up
it's just this little crop tee and it
has like and I don't know if they like
Japanese characters Chinese I think that
Japanese characters I don't quote me on
I I really have no idea but it's just
this really cool like classic Wyatt crop
tee I love just having basic cropped
ears like this for the beach to chuck on
over togs with a pair of shorts or
something the next thing that I got is
just this dress
it's like a long maxi dress so it's kind
of like a v-neck wit thing with the
buttons going all the way down and it
has like a cutout in the middle and it
sort of just sits where like your waist
is so it's really flattering and it goes
all the way to the floor and then at the
front it has like so little cutout
pieces so it opens where the buttons end
it can either be worn that's super
casually or dressed up I really like the
placement where they cut out to it
because it kind of just sits right near
your waist and for me I have a much
smaller way so it really just defines
that and kind of contours I'm so happy
with everything that I got I'm excited
to wear it all you're not feeling when
you get new things when you're just like
picturing like like how you'd wear it
and like when you can wear in like the
excitement of it I'm ready so that is
everything for this haul today I hope
