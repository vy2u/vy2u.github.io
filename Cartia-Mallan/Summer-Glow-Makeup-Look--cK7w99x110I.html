showing you guys my favorite kind of
like glam summery and makeup glow looks
I'm going to be using my new Frank
buddy's shimmer bomb range this stuff is
incredible it's pretty much made up
three products we've got a shimmer scrub
an illuminator and also a body oil
that's gonna help us achieve the most
stunning glowed up look ever so before I
start the makeup we've got to prep the
skin I'm taking many Frank's body
shimmer scrub and I'm just going to be
getting a little handful of this out you
guys have no idea how good this stuff
smells it literally smells like cookies
and cream and it's just the most
beautiful product ever this scrub has
sugar and C so roasted ground coffee
beans grapeseed oil and vitamin E so
it's made up of lots of incredible
products it also has maker in it and
this is just gonna help the skin feel
super soft really really glowy the best
little added bonus is that this product
is cruelty free and vegan so that is
amazing but what I like to do is I'm
gonna scrub it all over my body and then
you wait three minutes so it can seep
into your skin have a little boogie and
then go ahead and wash it all up and you
guys will feel the effects of this after
you feel so silky and you've got the
nicest glow as you can see on my skin
okay now when the makeup I'm taking my
magic its primer and putting this on as
a base layer and then I'm gonna go and
put some foundation and since I want
glowy I'm gonna take my Becca cosmetics
foundation I'm not sure what this one is
called I'm gonna leave all the products
linked below
I'm gonna mix this with a bit of my
Maybelline fit me foundation um this
just gets a perfect kind of color turn
and the fit me foundation is very jewy
as well so that's the look we're going
for today
then to conceal under my eyes and also
given that a little bit of highlight I'm
just obviously taking my concealer and
popping this under there and I also just
like to put it down the bridge of my
nose I'm on my forehead I had a little
pimple I'm just covering them up and
then also a little bit on my chin and
then I just like to buff this in
whatever I want to look extra bronzy and
glowy I take my whole quickie bronzing
stick and I pop this on my cheekbones my
forehead and under my jawline it gives a
really nice definition and it just makes
the skin tone or makes my skin tone just
look very low E and from Z and I just
love it and then afterwards I'm gonna go
over the top with more bronze also we're
gonna build it up
now I don't want to mattify this look
too much I just want to lightly set that
concealer and a few little spots like my
chin in places that get a bit oily so
I'm just very lightly dabbing a bit of
powder across my face okay then for this
part I would normally do my bronzer
first I had a total brain slip and I've
just jumped straight into blush but I'm
taking this beautiful hourglass blush to
give a nice peachy very flushed
sunkissed look and then I'm gonna go in
with my bronze up and we're getting that
go in with this I want to look super
glowy and very tanned this bronzer is
amazing for this and then for the second
star of the show this is the new Frank
Budd illuminator this stuff is
absolutely incredible and is made with
jojoba oil coconut oil Arabica coffee
seed oil and mica I just lightly rub my
finger in the product and then dab it
all over the spots on my face that I
want it and it blends in so effortlessly
onto my skin and adds such a natural
beautiful Joey Chlo as you can see yeah
um so I just put it on like above my
cheekbones like kind of a bumper add my
blush I put on my Cupid's bow put it
down my nose and then I love to put it
on my eyelids to kind of prime for the
eyeshadow but it also just adds a nice
extra like kind of glowy look there then
I'm gonna go ahead and fill in my crazy
bushy eyebrow there bitten out to the
moment excuse me that's using my benefit
goof proof brow pencil my OG for this
okay now time to get the eyes looking
super super glowy I'm gonna take this
color-coded dainty and Pat this all over
my lid and then I want to smoke it up
and kind of give a bronzy look to it as
well I'm taking these two colors on a
blending brush and blending this into my
crease and I just I love doing this I
think this just looks kind of makes the
eyes look very smoky and sultry and
really helped this shimmer turn pop now
you can go in with a black or a brown
pencil eyeliner I love to put this in
the water line and smudge it on my lower
lash line now this part is totally
optional but since I wanted this to be
kind of like a summer glam look I'm
gonna go ahead and add my classic winged
eyeliner you guys know I love this I
love adding a little bit of drama and
definition to the look so this helps
achieve that perfectly if you don't want
to do this step it will still look
really beautiful just with that eyeliner
on the waterline I'm just gonna go ahead
and draw my winged liner with my benefit
they're real push-up liner to add a
little bit more smokiness I'm taking a
dark brown and popping this right under
my lower lash line if you want to make
this a little bit more dramatic I would
suggest using black and then going in
and lining my lips I'm just using like
quite a nice nudey color and keeping it
really nice and simple and just fluffy
okay so once all of my glowy makeup is
done we're gonna step it up a notch and
I'm going in with the third Frank
product this is the shimmer oil this
stuff is absolutely beautiful it feels
so lovely on my skin it's made with
grapeseed oil coconut oil evening
primrose and mica and this is vegan it's
absolutely amazing it smells so
beautiful and it adds the most natural
incredible glow to your skin I literally
felt like a glowing goddess after this
so that is everything this makeup look I
