Sydney and it was a really impromptu
trip um I bought my first car and we
bought it from Sydney so we have to fly
down to Sydney and go and pick it up and
then I'm going to be driving it back up
to Brisbane and I was like why don't I
just flog since I haven't really had
time to film any proper videos this is
kind of like the next best thing I can
do because all have been requesting to
see more and more vlogs lately so I just
thought let's just keep doing that it'll
be my last vlog for a little while
because I am going to be getting back
into filming proper videos and stuff but
I'm so excited about this I've been
saving up for ages and finally a moment
I were just kind of like let's just buy
the car now you can finish doing your
loaners hours in it I'm excited to take
you guys with me to get it and I haven't
actually seen it yet I've just seen
photos and stuff but I'm so excited and
right now we're just about to catch a
cab to the airport and fly down to
Sydney and that's what's happening let's
gooo
you excited Kai now yes I'm excited very
excited to go to Sydney not
yeah Oh since we're only staying in
Sydney for one night we just crash at my
auntie Betty's place and this is me and
mum having a little part a java party
yeah true it's really going up in here
cuddle time with Kai now
okay so we've just gotten up and we've
gone ready and now we have to go ahead
to some car place to get a registration
number or something I'm not even really
sure what we have to do but apparently
it's going to take forever to get done
so I'm not looking forward to that but
do that the car person's gonna come pick
us up and then we're gonna go get Luna
which is what I've named the car we kind
of like thought of names for the car and
I was in either like Chico like sugar
baby cuz it's like all black or Luna and
I've gone faloona and I've got my little
Luna earrings in turn that seems really
corny but it wasn't meant to be like
that and I actually got them from Lady
Luna boutique it's just meant to be so
that's what's happening and I'm gonna
bring you guys a lot I'm so excite it's
the whole idea yeah part part so yeah
yeah just waiting for the cab and okay
so we've got our registration number
sorted yeah now what are we doing Kemal
I'm having a wander because we're
waiting for the deal
have to wait and deal with etiquette
dealer so while we were waiting I've
gone and bought two new Mac let's go
that's almost done
signing all the doctor just picked up
Luna hey going trough first dry okay so
far mum loving it it's amazing just a
pretty what a great pop of loving do you
see this
maybe we all fit it's meant to me it'll
sit there like rapidly I'll be doing
what for vlogging while I Drive we're
just heading it back to my auntie's
house now trip pick her up and then
we're going to sorry Hills do some
shopping and whatnot but um I can't
drive it yet because I share my L plates
on I'm one very excited
ah do you know where this like this is
Crown Street down here where are we
mother sorry baby sorry Hills I second
oh man we're gonna grab some lunch and
go up shopping and then
yo hi MA oh my girl because street
stylin
okay so we've just left Pam studios and
I'm just waiting in the car for mum and
my auntie they're gonna go get some food
I am so excited I literally just got
some of the new makeup forever primers
they're part with a whole range of new
patterns and Olga our friend from Pam
studios was telling me all about them
and how all this new stuff is coming
into in for makeup forever so if you've
seen my old synagogue you would have
seen me rave about p.m. studios they
have the most incredible makeup if
you're a makeup artist or you're really
into it you're actually serious about it
or you just want good quality makeup
they have incredible products and the
customer service that all the gives is
amazing we were literally in F like an
hour or so because she was so helpful
with matching all these colors and
getting everything sorted anyways rant
over I haven't really been able to talk
through my vlog much so far because it's
been so quick within like racing around
everywhere and getting so much stuff
done um little quick chat about the car
I'm so excited I don't want it to be
like me brag or anything it's not meant
to be like that at all I saved up a lot
of money for this car I save for so long
but the method behind the madness is
that if I get a nice car now then it can
last me double the amount of time as if
I'm buying a crappy car that is half
broken already and won't last me as long
so that's why I wanted to get this so
when I do move down to Sydney I've got a
small little zippy car and it'll just be
perfect for everything
also excuse my nail polish it's all
coming off and it's really gross and
yeah it is now we're going to go back to
sorry Hills and do some op shop in I
needed buy clothes for cheap because I'm
poor off to buying this little baby
