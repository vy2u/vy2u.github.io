messy
ah
literally
Messi is I think affecting change oh my
god the missive physics it's me to sit
no okay
oh my god buddy oh car Diaz in a lay
with my dad this is so weird the day
you're about to watch his film two
moment ago when I was in Australia in
Byron Bay now same with cardia and now
cardi is in LA same with me so we look
so different now like we look so
different now so the video that you're
about to watch is really the moment that
we came up with this idea the exact
moment we started filming after we got
the idea just like it is all filmed in
live time from two months ago we have
made this whole thing actually come to
life which is so exciting yeah both of
us because like starting from like one
 up like dream that we kind of had
that we know like thought would really
come to life to now being in LA I
believe on this road trip um for the
messy effect or which you guys will
understand everything about in the video
and we get like pretty heated in
discussion but I've like cut it down a
lot because a lot of the content they
actually spoke about in the video is
what I'm going to be speaking about on
the tour so this video you're going to
see our idea come to life and what we
want to sort the about and we embark on
the tour in literally two days we leave
like it is a Friday right now we leave
office to it over tomorrow I'm all right
then I leave on Monday like it's
actually happening and I'm just like so
proud of us for actually making this
happen and then hopefully bringing
people together like our whole goal with
this is just to create an actual online
community of compassionate open-hearted
like loving individuals and inspire
people so we hope that you're inspired
by this video and we hope that you guys
join us on this messy affect like even
if you don't get to come to the toilet
they can see it's like isn't everything
it's young again I likes it's a
community now I'm going to try and find
ways to help you guys connect mobile I
get like a Facebook page just let me
weigh everyone control yourself yeah I'm
seeing them oh snap
now you can start half bagging stuff
hashtag the Messi effect and share your
reaction to this video share your story
open up and create connection and the
genuine kids I want to find other people
that are involved in this other people
you can like tap into it's not just us
and you one who hashtags and Messi
effect
um connect with each other comment you
like it's like a family thing that I
guess like we should explain too much
now but like yeah we'll have more videos
like about this and about what we're
doing um really soon but this is just a
video to kind of launch it explain what
the it is
it's a little bit late I guess but it's
it's it just had to come as a cam and
I'm old man where's your China for ideas
this is a big thing we're trying to take
on and it's really hard to try and
narrow it down to a few topics or a few
things but we'll get there I'm just so
 excited to be I'm planning away
I can't believe it come by
so we were going to sit down today and
possibly film a video about my changing
topics and then okay so we went and got
breakfast this morning
and we sat down and we were planning the
dates that I was planning on going to
America because I've been planning my
American June for a month to do some
work and to 7mr
like that's not a road trip within you a
road trip and we wanted to do this road
trip and so we started planning out what
we wanted to do forever like we're just
in a zoo under here but we do in each
city and then cardio is like we should
go and get groups of people together in
each city that we travel to and just
talk to them and connect with people and
talk about what we care about drain up
first things first since we've been
Taylor a lot has change and a lot is
opened up if you want to watch this
video right now we ask for your respect
and for you to have an open mind
otherwise you're not gonna get much from
it if you open your mind up right now
and you sit down with us and listen to
what we have to say you'll get a lot
from this video and we'll be able to
help a lot of people straight up it's
just like these parties we've recognized
our power and our influence and before
it was just kind of a behind what we
thought were big dreams then yeah and it
strains not about they're not
self-centered dreams their dreams about
our world you know dreams about the
people that inhabit this world we live
in because it's in aiding social change
we've been speaking about in the past
two weeks every single day we've been
getting out into nature and we've been
talking about social conformity and
about the world we live in now and what
the problems are we were just talking
about out on the balcony we were talking
the road trip and we were like how
people always use society as an excuse
like they're like oh I can't dress this
way because society says I can oh I
can't act this way or I'm a lesser
person because of society okay the thing
that we were not so fired up about is
that our like we are now society our
generation you watching this right now
you're the yeah everything that we are
doing right now is changing and forming
so this is a big thing to say it's like
we were at a point now or like we don't
care if people think this is crazy
we don't care if people think this is
going on right now is crazy
because the world we're living in right
now is up crazy and someone has
to say about this is straight up a
proposal we want to start a revolution
we want to start a and change a
real change it's it's like you might be
like what change what do you want to
change so it's lighter than you yeah
we're like like it's we want to change
society's rules we want to change the
way that people think especially you
this is targeted at youth teenagers and
people in their 20s then even their
early 30s because you guys are at the
point where you can start making
happen and you don't real we really just
clicked injures then it all kind of came
off the idea of the house holding to em
about when I was younger and I had a
rebellious phase something started going
to festivals and once I realized how dom
society was i didn't fit into society's
mold of what was not ways to get in
trouble my teachers as you get bagged up
by people's parents mean that she's bad
news because i think can form and people
don't like that that i'd like
when people break the rules i don't like
when people do something outside of
books because they want everyone to be
clones of everyone so nothing bad
happens so everything's peaceful and
calm it's just what we're trying to do
is create an aware
in each of you that you have the power
like we're talking about that dumb hope
that everyone always says be the change
that you wish to see in the world and
people kind of throw it around post on
their Instagram have in their bio but it
doesn't really mean anything to them
because we were all really being the
change that we wish to see there would
be change and there's not we're stagnant
we're in a place where a segment where a
place were so many people are oppressed
we're in a place where a racist bigoted
asshole might become president of the
United States that scares me
yeah we somehow I don't know it's
whether it's through in a way that we've
connected with the world we're around
the way that we've taken the time to
connect with people and appreciate the
world we live in we have respect for
this place we have respect for other
humans I don't know if it's from that
but somehow we've gotten to a point our
minds when something is clicked for us
and we understand almost in a little way
how we could possibly get some stuff to
change it for both of us we realize it's
through youth and it's through a
positive message it through what
awakening at this thing of wanting to
live and wanting it our needs and
empower and we are now society and we
now can change things and stop blaming
other people and stopping like I can't
because of this social pressure because
you're creating that when you
acknowledge it this is a movement and
this is a movement in regards to
awakening your brain so M was exciting
to me talking about Egyptian culture and
how the world repeats itself and how
history repeats itself and stuff and on
in quite a spiritual level we all
vibrate off different frequencies and so
and what's happening right now is with
you thing born they are being born on a
higher frequency they can connect more
and
can get more and they're being they're
more empathetic and everything we are so
reaching towards interconnection even
with how things have progressed with
social media you know as we are so
interconnected not even as beings with
each other but in the ways I've brought
back you have the power to do so much
more than you may expect so what we want
to do is we want to start this movement
toward the messy effect and it all came
from the name of like Emma's blog the
messy heads we're thinking like the
messy heads like were these wild kids
that get something something sticking in
our brain that we are older than our age
where understanding more and we want
change we realize what else is there to
do in life yeah what else are we going
to do with our voices with our platform
are we going to keep talking about
superficial things are we going to stand
up and be like I can do this yeah I can
change us so if you get anything from
this video if you're completely confused
we are to like honestly I can explain
what's like - yong-ran out this is for
everyone and it can be for anyone if you
open up your mind a little bit to what
is going on in the world and stop trying
to downgrade things just to seem cool -
it is I don't know so I'm going to start
thinking that negativity is cool stop
thinking that doing nothing guys like
old lame or like I usually get soaked
down on the blog because people think oh
it's like about positivity and about you
know I don't think that they shouldn't
give a because of says we need to
give a and we're the people that
can start changing some stuff because
you may not realize it I'll try and tell
us that we're done I don't try and
downgrade you from your age I freaking
hate it when people say like oh it's
just you're young okay hey the ruling
about age little legal stuff of being of
age
now I can tell you how intelligent you
are or what you know because of
your age it doesn't mean people
think I'm 25 I'm 17 years old and I've
got a brain on me that could have lived
100 lives from what I feel like I
understand or what I've lived and that
is me accepting that I've got that and
so right now I'm telling you I don't
care how large up you're 14 if you're 15
if you're 16 into 25 and you're watching
this you all have influence because
you're still of this younger generation
and you can push something you
understand technology you understand
what is coming for the world and you
feel how does a lip brush your eyes and
you see what's wrong the generations
before are just accepting understand you
are powerful understand that yes you're
one person but you're a domino yes
you're one person but one person is the
biggest difference that you can make and
it's hard to accept that that we're the
mouthpieces for this revolution but you
or everyone to know everyone is involved
in this and it's oh it's almost a
 lifestyle a messy lifestyle
because who wants a clean cut bridge
lifestyle who wants rules are they
ticked off like this you want to mess
anything you want something wild if you
crave a wild lifestyle and a wild life
this is almost like a way of life a way
of thinking we want to try and change
people's perspective of what living life
isn't what it should be this is an
environment we want to create a people
creatives people that are switched on
people that crave connection connection
and crave to want to learn and crave 22
experience because I swear to God like
half of the people in living it's what
to anything and what else is that doing
life besides experience yeah besides
create genuine connections and besides
use yourself in your voice and your
place here on earth to help people and
to be a positive influence there's rules
right there is rules of life yeah the
laws the idea of laws is seriously
 I'm a human right and this other
human was born this guy that is the
prime minister or the president of a
certain country and they may have gotten
to that point with connections knowing
other human stuff but this guy is a
human he was born out of a woman's body
I was born a woman's body as well what's
different about him to me
but he's creating rules for me I don't
know this guy he's not a family man he
doesn't know me but he's making rules
for me and then he's got other minions
below him that are saying well you have
to do otherwise I'm going to punish you
we're all slaves there it's a slave
culture people talk to get educated on
how slaves used to be you know how
slavery is so horrible but we're slaves
living in this world with higher powers
once you realize this I'm obviously
there's laws in place to keep harmony
and that I do respect laws and I respect
rules that have been made but like I
don't have to accept that yeah you don't
have to accept it I'm not saying going
bowed and so I'm not saying about a
woman saying understands within you to
ignite a fuel and a love for life we
still have so 70 80 or 90 years of our
life here left in this world that we
live in now do you want the rest of your
life to be filled with the negative
stuff that you may be holding in
about you maybe depressed eating
disorder you may have all sorts of
different things maybe sitting there
thinking I want to end in my life now
because I don't want to have to deal
with that or do you want to try and
work towards switching your mindset and
enjoying life imagine all the possible
feelings you can experience if if you
switch your mind from switching your
mind then you'll be able to connect with
people again a lot of you guys comment
on my videos about how you're jealous
that I have these friends in my life and
that you just wish that you crave to
either be my friend or have friends like
my friends do what if you want that this
is the movement that needs to happen so
people can talk again and
connect again because that's why I don't
really we're so bad at connecting we're
still better communicate and that's why
it's like there's six billion people in
this world and it shouldn't be that hard
to make friends it should be easy to see
them connect with someone but people
have barriers and they've got blockages
in their system that they haven't yet
identified and release
so this messy effect what we're going to
do we're speaking up we want to speak to
people one-on-one in person in groups
I'm going to say to you it's not for any
reason there's no point to this besides
our genuine love and care for the
universe and for the people in it and
for you guys that are watching this
because we've got nothing else to do
what does mommy also be doing make my
senior make more money I could sit here
in for months years environ I could live
environment and sit here and keep making
money and keep buying and travel
and it's not any experience of it is
myself but or I can see I've literally
come to a point where I'm like I
honestly don't give a what I'm
doing besides creating a change and like
from me creating a change I know that
I'll get rewards back for myself and I
can do stuff for myself but this is what
we're doing I'm coming to America in
June I'll be there for the whole month
what we have planned is a road trip the
road trip was created purely Adam we
want to go on and George wants to show
me some beach towns and we can take some
fun photos I can make films they
love making films and all that stuff but
what we thought is we're going to start
tagging we're going to get this messy
effect thing out there so people like
what is this and hopefully they can find
a video like this yeah they can find
other videos we're going to create or
find out the videos you guys create yeah
with this messy effect tag it's the
messy effect and it's come from us being
messy heads and messy girls and messy
boys this is not just for ghosts or
anyone with a creative mind or her mind
that wants change and happiness cuz we
all recognize that the world is
up so I know the ones that can change
that
the road trip is pretty much we don't
know definite data come to mind other
dates the days will be released but this
is really gonna be the starting point of
the messy effect is going to be this
road trip is going to be going from town
to town talking with you guys like in
person making the connection and
figuring out how we can spread this and
how we can help individuals change we
don't know what we're going to talk
about we don't know what it's going to
be we're going to rock up and we're
going to say ask us some stuff let's
 chat let's talk about it let's
talk it out yeah let's talk about what
are you seeing out there that you want
change and how what can we actually do
on an individual level or as a group and
spreading we want to spread the message
of what the messy effect is we want to
go around and tell people what this tag
is what this lifestyle is what this
revolution is for young people and so
what is going to be
we'll travel around and then we will
post up we'll pick around but we'll meet
everyone there and we'll just sit down
and chat it'll kind of go like that
there'll be other people there not just
us yeah and we want to start something
we want this to be big we want to create
controversy I want to make some people
mad I want to make some people
happy I want to make you guys relieved
that you're not alone on this and that
people like us I guess we care I'm
telling you there's people that care and
we'll do everything we can but this is
not just us this is a family this is a
community yes this is a collective and
how we're talking about why would why do
you want to put yourself up on a
platform for other people to admire you
when we could it's like staff down those
barriers and works like all equal and
what I what I hate is how people put
themselves above other humans just
because of what they might wear or how
much money they earn or whatever we're
all equal I'm conscious enough we're all
equal I know better than you it's like
you know what our plan is so I don't
keep swearing well I'm very you know
frantic and I'm excited this like this
I'm excited it's like maybe I see stress
my guys seem mad but I'm just like
relieved and excited and like this is a
big thing for me because no one really
does this on this world YouTube world
that we live in because I was logging
world know everyone plays to nice so
let's start being let's just stop being
this is me I'm being me and it's slowly
it's you guys have seen it coming and
now I'm actually at the point I'm just
like screw the rest of the recipes
through the rest of the waiting why wait
what are we waiting for let's let's do
it like I'm that excited but I have like
both three present
cardian for prez I've seen that trending
on Twitter the messy effect is a thing
I've seen that it's not me it's it's
it's it how are y'all yeah I its Oh
crazy I hope we really are crazy
but if I hope you guys understand what
we're trying to do it's the messy effect
it's not just us it's everyone and I
feel like everyone should be a part of
it explains it to Emma it's like there's
been many like grunge teen rebellions in
history but it's not one more it's like
oh yeah go out and take drugs and get
 up and drink and smoke it's a
rebellion of your mind because your mind
has been the number one most oppressed
thing in the entire world you've been
trying to think how thinking
so we're rebelling against how our
brains are trained and what other people
are trying to brainwash you with it's
literally rebelling against the
brainwash of society whether they start
up your life or your purpose for living
a life this is what's crazy it's like
the concept of a do-over life you can
edit this out by this like thought yes
or no you know people were like everyone
has this big dream inside of them and
they're like oh I'll do it later
I'll do the practical thing now I want
to saw like a nine-to-five job and I'll
do what I really want later and then
later comes in they're like well I'm in
a secure job I have a family I guess my
dream like this without my mom yeah
having so many people like they have an
actual dream and they don't follow it
yes your only is your ladies like that
not just do it now yeah like with you
you don't start out if you need me we're
just like it I'm gonna do it
because why not everything will work out
you have to have some faith you need to
stop being so negative about everything
yeah everyone is pointing at him about
everything I can't do this what if that
happens it if what if that happens
be strong and tough and take it on
putting people down for their passions
stop saying that you can't do something
stop saying that other people can't do
something and just start doing something
turn something that we're so crazy but
the Messi effect is coming I feel that
 crazy
I just I'm I am so happy about this
she almost just started crying before we
film this video I'm ready to be myself
now and like actually be able to put all
this love I have for humanity and love I
have for the universe and love I have
for the people around me out there and
start doing something with my platform
especially in this community this
YouTube community I feel like it's so
competitive and it's so ridiculous and
it's just like everyone's on their own
path do you not realize is life and
everyone's going to get a job at here
and then everyone's going to make money
but like why don't we start helping out
noise and then see if I could find a
message that you care about and it
doesn't have to be in every video but
start sprinkling it over and start
helping people even with or so if you're
pink you say let's start asking
questions and be confused together and
figure out it's not it doesn't make you
less of a person if you don't understand
something or if you need to look up
stuff you can use search for it or
whatever we are still in the process of
learning anyways I'm going to start
talking out because let's finish off
this video because I feel like we're
just rambling you know so much we're
just going to start doing this this is a
we're activists we want to start making
a change in the world and we want start
making a change in individuals and
within ourselves and start promoting
love and happiness
because what happiness I'm feeling
happiness and love is the best I can't
even tell you if you haven't experienced
it yet it's coming don't worry it's
possible to find open yourself up to it
yeah much love we do this because we're
very passionate about you guys and you
guys have helped us get to this point
honestly I can't thank you we can't
thank you that you guys have helped us
get to a point where it's like you've
showed that what we've done has helped
you and that's pushed us to want to help
more and help more people and get our
message out it's not about get ask any
other it's the message in so spread the
message spread the message BEC spread
this message of life I'm about to set
this up how many times I'm going to go
by boxing so I feel like those literally
just like a rock clump pumped in my
throat that I just really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
