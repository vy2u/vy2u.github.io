guys I'm here with Stella Raye and if
you guys don't know Stella she um has a
YouTube channel
yes yeah my name and it all over it so
today we're out in this like really
beautiful house this is service mr. mrs.
beacons house and um I've just come out
here and we're filming in this really
beautiful location talked to you about
like I'd die and like that sounds tough
but I've a lot of you guys know that I'm
plant-based and I spoke about like going
vegan or going plant-based like a little
while ago and since then I've never
actually answered like any questions
about it and Stella is like 100% vegan
so I guess we're going to talk about
like answer a few questions about my
plant-based diet and your vegan diet and
both are totally acceptable like this
it's just our lives yeah it's just I'm
we're on different journeys with it like
yeah I'm on like a slower journey to
veganism and Stella's already there and
I think that I feel like people in this
community can get really quick to judge
or like hate on it but I think if
someone's making a little bit of
progress towards something like this
then let them take that time and I think
it's epic that they're still helping out
in some way shape or form so no
negativity is wanted on this this is to
educate and to help some people on their
journeys so it's going to jump straight
into the questions we're also going to
be filming a Q&amp;amp;A like type that just
probably us chatting about dumb on
your tongue I love that that's my
favorite do you drink vegan alcohol I
honestly don't I didn't know that
alcohol wasn't yeah sometimes they just
filter it through like bone char
whatever like the sugar it's actually
why I know it's I mean I didn't know
that alcohol wasn't vegan I just ran
normal alcohol like I like tequila and
stuff so I guess not I don't really know
what yeah is it hard to find vegan food
or restaurants when you're going out to
lunch when you're not in LA I would say
it can be like is amazing for vegan food
honestly everywhere you go you just like
Google something there's like vegan
every getting well like everywhere and
it's so amazing but I don't know I feel
like it's it's not really hard I've
never really been someone that's like I
honey anything normally there's at least
one salad on the menu or um I don't know
I just it's always you can always alter
star for asked alter stuff just yeah
they take the cheese off do this do that
like and sometimes it may seem like it's
not going to taste as good but most of
the time it ends up tasting better
because it's just fresh food that you're
eating and it's probably much healthier
than the other crap on the menu so I
find it super easy but I guess it's just
yeah you just have to know what you're
looking for and know the options yeah do
you take any supplements I take b12 and
I remember yeah I'm not really that
regular about it i I never like in the
first like six months or so seven months
of being plant-based I never took any
supplements or anything and then I kind
of got to a point where I realized I was
getting really sleepy okay I'm and I was
really drained and I was like okay
people warned me about this
and one I wasn't eating enough greens I
wasn't like actually eating big enough
quantities of food yeah so I like meat
wrapped up my greens and everything and
then um and then I got iron tablets be
so careful with the iron tablets you get
though because some of them can be
really harsh on your body and be
constipated it's really really gross
yeah
because your body can't process it very
well so I recommend taking if you're
taking iron take it with vitamin C it
like helps it break down and then I also
do want to get some b12 but you can also
get like b12 shots apparently yeah I've
never done that either they stick a
needle up your bum and yeah I just take
like a few other like vitamins and stuff
like vitamin C and zinc and
damn you got it on stuff I love them a
person is back I was watching that vegan
alcohol exam so I am how do you respond
to people who hate on veganism I don't I
don't know they're not the same mindset
as me so why would I hate on them yeah I
think it's a very silly thing to hate on
I just don't understand how people can
judge others for what they're putting in
their body especially when it's like
when it's trying to aid in some way to
help yeah and like when it's actually
healthier for you yeah and it's so much
better for the planet as well and I just
think that all the time when people hate
on it that is defensive about their own
diet and they don't feel like it's
possible for themselves to become vegan
or plant-based and I'm instead of like
taking it as an offensive way just be
like you do you do me like yeah just
kindly recommend them to educate
themselves a little bit honor we're home
to watch cowspiracy that was ever that
was the one that like really got me my
parents won't let me excuse me
my parents won't let me go vegan what
can I say that will make them change
their mind laying down the law actually
number one you are in control of your
own body and you have your own mind like
you are not your parents and they are
not you they have no right to tell you
what you're putting in your body yeah
besides like this really up
but like eating vegan is not yeah would
you say I would say um well I made it
actually made a video with my dad about
this okay so watch it because he gives
his perspective as a parent yep
what he was thinking and going through
when I first went vegan so that might
help to you know if you watch it with
your parents
mm-hmm I open both of your minds because
ultimately your parents just want you to
be healthy and happy so yeah and I think
the show conventions around the diet
yeah and it's like bad for you in any
way but um it's really not I think it's
really cool to show them show them
cowspiracy I think I think cuz that's a
that's not necessarily about the diet
side it's about like the environment the
environment and then also 101 reasons to
become V yeah so it was like because
it's really graphically explained you
kind of sit back me like
Hey oh yeah yeah I recommend that Oh
good time how did you find transitioning
to a vegan diet did you find it hard
cutting out dairy I personally didn't
find it hard at all the only thing that
was a challenge was just giving my
parents to come her into the idea of it
hmm
but just as for me I just I couldn't
have done with it so quickly and it just
made sense to me right away so I
personally didn't really like have a
struggle did you I went vegan or not or
not being in plant-based overnight and
for me I didn't really drink much dairy
anyways like I cut out dairy like a long
time before that because it literally
just made me feel so good
Oh sick like I was like think about like
when you have a milkshake or like
something if you like have like a
smoothie that's full of dairy like you
should not feel like really ill in your
stomach after you can she not like it's
not supposed to be that way so I cut out
dairy way before that and I always just
kind of drank soy milk but switching
everything else was actually just like
easy for me I was just kind of like the
mine that I had in my head was just
caught a there's so much other food you
can eat besides this stuff just yeah
when you access to it's like why do why
what's your favorite vegan meal
everything I ever you didn't know I was
making good what were the most
beneficial aspects that came from going
vegan both physically and mentally hmm
physically I would say my skin cleared
up a lot that was the first thing that I
really noticed I just feel better like
more energized I feel gross after I eat
I feel good and like I want to do things
and motivated and as for mentally I just
feel a lot more compassionate and
empathetic towards not only animals but
just everyone like everything and I feel
a lot more connected to the earth
physically I feel like yeah my skin
definitely cleared up a lot um
well my skin was never never bad before
that but I just feel like it was like
glowing a little more um inside wise I
don't feel as like heavy a glob yeah
mentally I feel now that I know this it
makes me want to like educate myself
further on not only stuff to do with
like veganism but with our environment
which I really love and I think I have a
lot more of an open my
about and I care a lot more about that
stuff now yes I'm like a part of it I'm
like actively doing something with that
oh do you guys prefer savory or sweet
food more I just this is funny because
before I went plant-based I was crazy
sweet too
we're insane sweetie and I could never
never ever kick it I would always pick
sweet food over savory and then once I
went plant-based a week and I was like
all my sugar cravings not all of them
but like most of them are gone I'm such
a savory go now Wow hmm isn't that
amazing your body can change it like
both I don't know it depends on ya at a
time yeah as Emma just said like most
people that go plant-based eventually go
vegan as well and it's like taking one
step at a time with it because I guess
some people can just do it overnight and
all those like it's a big lifestyle
change like it's a lot you have to
really take into consideration and yeah
totally worth it and yeah I hope you
