your own head your town your way of life
to place you currently stand bound by a
pass and tethered to the future you feel
your brain full of questions and hopes
and dreams without ever really
considering that maybe you could have it
all it can be hard not to feel stagnant
and lost at times of silence moments of
stillness doesn't matter how fast you
may be moving how quickly the lights are
flashing your mind so tells you that you
are still bound to the earth beneath
your feet
reality has morphed into images of times
and faces talking heads lost souls
aching for love desperate for attention
thriving on the energy of others selfish
and greedy yet we call this the way of
life it's the hunt for competition
driving for satisfaction more and more
we always want more the clock ticks the
bell rings the minutes evaporate into
the air and I find myself asking why are
we still waiting for the glass to be
full tormented by words that ring in our
heads from strangers that mean nothing
more than a hello and a goodbye what
happened to connection what happened to
trust within us single beings are
stronger than they think we have hearts
so strong that we could lift a nation
although we hide it away trapped in the
darkness because power is too strong for
us to hold anxious for the future and
depressed about the past
we constantly torment ourselves out of
reality out of now
what happens when you just release when
you actually connect with this yes this
whatever this is to you this moment
you're in right this very second this is
what is real this is all we have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
