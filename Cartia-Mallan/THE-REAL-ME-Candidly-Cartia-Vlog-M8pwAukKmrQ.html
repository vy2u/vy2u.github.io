granting stun and my just favorite human
and my cat you came it's gonna be
talking to my camera whoa I look like an
egghead oh my I look like this right now
really confused mmm so today I was
supposed to film a makeup video because
I was supposed to be doing one Beauty
video week and one other video so it
could be like other as in like a blog or
something but I was really trying to do
my beauty for you guys but I just like
honestly don't have any ideas cuz I bet
I'd literally wear the same makeup every
single day not every single day but
anytime I go out like I'm so boring with
makeup like I just don't do anything fun
so when I think up something fun like
and actually cool I'm gonna film it then
but I will definitely try to do more
Beauty like skincare stuff and all that
I just think I am I procrastinated too
much and got really lazy and now we're
at this point and I'm like one of what
can i film today and I was like well I
don't really feel like putting makeup on
getting real glam Singh from a big light
so I'm gonna do a what would you call it
Sophie you watch a lot of YouTube like a
day in the life oh yeah we'll just what
I'm just gonna like for just today
today's Saturday it is 17th of September
so you guys are going to be saying like
this is you're watching this and it's
happening at this yesterday went to a
friend's party last night and then this
morning we just got up and Sophie and I
went for a little walk and I've just
been like actually slouching that was my
phone that just chopped slides around
I'm actually right now watching one of
Johnny's videos and it's the strip Jon
challenge and I think I'm gonna film
that tomorrow because I actually really
like the idea of that okay
with um obsession all right on the
grande like sorry but her voice is
amazing
easy I just made um two months spinach
I've oh oh a lemon seed mess nutritional
yeast salt pepper and lemon juice
Yamuna we are gonna head down to the
beach now sorry Maya

the back all of the beach and then
selfies mummy and daddy you're looking
lovely Bend It Like Valley are you ready
for this the hunter is not focusing kind
of you can kind of see it I saw a little
bit of me a little bit there's a piece
called what it goes Beach here we are
Ronan roll up roll up already
okay I just want to go to cookie I got
some new Oh oh yeah the boys Sophie that
guy with the brothers our neighbor my
little plant he's have been put up in
this books so I feel like I've achieved
something today I've honestly been
meaning to replace him for so long now
I'm back at home just drinking some
coffee about to watch an episode knockos
because I'm obsessed with it it's
literally so good then I'll probably
just do some email stuff and then make
some dinner and then I'm going to a
party tonight should we good
even know what to say acknowledge the
fact of how crappy I am when I set out
to film something I literally leave my
camera around oh just go someone forget
to take it with me and film and stuff so
maybe I maybe I'll make this vlog over
today and tomorrow just so you guys can
actually see more of what I properly do
because I really want you guys to have
to see like what I get up to and stuff
and just random happenings of my daily
life today I've been feeling a little
bit weird I guess um every time I go
away to Sydney and like go there for
work and stuff like Sydney's very
fast-paced and I'm like use like boom
boom boom and then when I come home I
always get so weird I can never just
settle I'm just like oh I should be
doing stuff and it's feel very unkind
it'll over the time so it takes me a few
days just like get grounded again and
just chill out again and just be able to
like flow in with that and stuff but
then it's also still finding balance
with like wait a minute this is your job
like you still have to film and stuff
and like I'm just currently trying to
find the right balance and try and find
the work ethic when I'm away and then
when I'm here and then like trying to
balance it all it's just hard sometimes
I guess juggling it all and still
mentally trying to stay clear and like
positive and feel good and also just
feel grounded my one thing is feeling
grounded feeling like I'm securing that
I've got anchors that are like making me
feel like I'm at home even when like I'm
always on the go so enough any of this
makes sense I can't even make sense of
it to myself so we'll see literally all
I'm thinking about right now is not
cause I am so keen towards this okay so
I've just had a shower and oh it's I'm
just gonna make some dinner I go out and
it's gonna cook a sweet potato literally
all I eat so if you just went out for
dinner and I asked her to bring me back

red wine oh and if it is you then you do
