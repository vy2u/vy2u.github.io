just have to bite the bullet um why do I
feel so it's really awkward oh my god I
do that now okay hi hello everyone I'm
Connie mulatto and today I'm doing this
stripped-down challenge so I saw Shani
grimmons video of this and I'm not sure
who this was exactly created by she did
mention in the video but I'll find out
and I'll put it down in the description
box um
so pretty much the sort of a video of me
talking and I don't edit out anything so
there's gonna be me you doing there's
like getting awkward and like no I don't
know like I'm not cutting out when I
like mess up with what I say and the
truth is a lot of the time when I
actually film videos I'll like say
what's wrong or I'll start out like I am
so stuttery a lot of the time and so
normally that all gets edited out and
you guys just see the I was just
checking out I guess
you guys are still may end up seeing the
like clean cut version um that's not
happening today um so I have a little
like notebook of just a few talking
points in case I'm not really sure what
to say but I wanted to start off I just
in calm down like I don't know why I'm
so knows about this but I just I'm going
to start off by talking about I guess
why I'm so nervous right now and why
this kind of horrified to me and knowing
that like there's no turning back now
that all this is going to be posted
online is the fact that being honest
with you guys I suck at being vulnerable
like vulnerability scares the out
of me um which is so weird because I
actually really do enjoy being
vulnerable and I really enjoy that
because there's such a lot of fear
there's such a adrenaline I guess
involved in it because it's like you're
just putting everything out of the line
if that makes any sense
um and I don't I don't know I don't know
what to say
um I yeah I have a hard time being
vulnerable because I guess I'm such a
person that I don't want anyone to have
to deal with any issues I don't want
anyone to have to like know about any of
my life big issues could never want to
have to put someone else out I guess I'm
such a Lia I'm literally like not fun I
can sort everything out for myself and
you do everything for myself I'm strong
I'm independent Lola but um I guess I
take it to the next extreme and then I
guess after a while doing that so many
years when I was going to doing that and
having to like look after everyone else
and putting myself second it made it
very difficult for me to UM I guess tell
people how I felt sometimes or like
actually be vulnerable and then if it
came to like time to talk about me or my
issues I'd be like oh no no no like I'm
fine but I'd always be there like chat
people about theirs and um I guess it
comes back to my online life as well I'm
super vulnerable online a lot of the
time um but there's like a whole lot
that you guys don't see and that I also
don't share just because I guess I still
need some amount of privacy in my life
but I feel like the more I am not open
with you guys and not as vulnerable
online I feel like I'm not being
truthful to myself and truthful to I
stand for because really at the end of
their like who the cares why does
it matter if I'm saying this stuff um
because if I can be my vulnerable self
online then maybe it'll help someone
else do the same just in their everyday
life or with people um mmm I got doc
Quinn saying like vulnerability and then
it's work friends and relationships I
guess I just kind of spoke about work
stuff but at the moment I'm just really
challenging myself more to UM be more
vulnerable in line and this is why I'm
doing this video to try and just put it
out there and I did it with the last
look I just posted which was just super
random and raw and uncut and I actually
really enjoy that because I want you
guys to get to know me better
um and I want you to feel like I want
you involved and welcomed into my life
and to the person that I really am like
I was speaking to my roommate Sophie and
I was like wow like it's so weird
posting this because I think a lot of
people don't think I actually have like
a sensor
world that I'm not like my personality
is super quirky like I love cracking
jokes I love just being an absolute fool
and I guess when I'm doing normal
sit-down videos like I don't think about
like I'm like putting on my like I'm
filming now so it's like I'm speaking
properly and I'm not doing that I guess
and so I guess it was just it's really
nice when people meet me and they're
like well you're actually like you're
like funny and you're like ah pee and
you're like you know this is what you're
like on in-person stuff and um yeah
anyways I did I don't know that many
sense like what about um and then here
with friends vulnerability like I'm
pretty good when it comes to being when
I'm around close friends um I guess
after people like when I become close
with someone and I spent a lot of time
with them obviously I build up trust and
stuff but still even when I'm really
close friends or someone if I'm
struggling with something it'll take me
like kind of a while to like tell them
that I'm not okay and that maybe I want
to chat with them or normally they'll
end up just being like cutting out what
the fuck's wrong so that's something I
also really want to work on but I guess
I'm just scared being vulnerable with
friends or just people around me a lot
of the time just because I just don't
want to put them out and I also just
have I have had really bad experience
with friendships in the past so I have
such a tough skin built up and such a
barrier built up bit only when it comes
to when I need help I don't know if this
makes sense I know but whoaaah and the
third and final one vulnerability in
relationships vulnerability with boys or
with if if was I even give they then I
keep forgetting though car just ended it
so I'm like it whenever I feel my
literally we're talking about just stop
and like slouch and like compose my
thoughts and be like oh that's what I'm
saying vulnerability with boys um or
vulnerability if you're into girls or
whoever your intellect is vulnerability
in relationships so for me I am the
worst when it comes to um being
vulnerable with a partner or with
I guess because I have had my fair share
of like guys that I've been seeing or
dating or just like whatever else and a
lot of the time for me um I'll go for
people that I just know it's like ah I
do know where I'm going with this at
night I don't know I'm really bad at
just being really upfront because I'm so
scared of getting hurt I guess and like
a lot of girls a lot of us like this
because dating culture now is absolutely
 up like it's horrible there's no
there's no honesty involved anymore and
it makes it really hard if one person
does want to be vulnerable and be open
and honest because they're just so
scared that the other ones just going to
be like oh like about it you know like
I'm sure you understand what I'm saying
by that but I guess over time I just
built up this thing that I'll be out
there and I'm confident I'm going to
talking but when it comes down to like
if I actually really have feelings for
someone it's like I just end up playing
games instead of being vulnerable and
telling them and it's just such a bad
habit I've gotten into and I hate myself
for it because it ruins so much when
you're connecting with someone because
there's blocks because there's no
honesty anymore and I guess what I'm
really hoping for it I'm gonna speak
more about it like relationship stuff
and I was talking to one of my friends
Julia and she's just met this guy and
she's like oh but I I just can't be
vulnerable with him I just freaked and I
just change the subject and stuff and I
was like no like be vulnerable like
expose yourself like he's trying to be
vulnerable if you you should just be
vulnerable back and she was like you're
one to talk
like take your advice I was literally
like yeah true I I need to take my
advice because I suck at it like I know
I'm something I'm definitely going to
try more I'm horrified of it because
obviously I don't to get hurt and I
guess being online as well it just makes
dating anyone a whole lot harder like I
feel like if you're online you're a guy
you literally have chicks just like
flocking obviously sometimes for the
wrong reasons just to get attention and
stuff but the girls I feel like or for
me at least being online is like
actually hindered and he like love like
it used to have because most of the time
people think I'm unapproachable or they
think like they're not good enough
because I've got a following or they
judge themselves believe and try and I'm
like I'm literally the same like I'm a
human I'm haven't changed one bit since
I was online and well some people just
kind of don't want to be in that
attention zone and I totally get that
but um it's something that I'm trying to
figure out and I'm just like I don't get
it like and it also makes me knowing
that I'm online it makes me like act
differently around them because I'm like
what if do they think differently about
me like do they think that I'm gonna be
like and then there's just a whole an
own personal judgement
anyway I ramble so frickin much so I'm
just gonna jump onto something else um
and like oh this is slowly yeah this is
slowly this like I feel really good that
I'm like saying all this like this is
like a release hello what is this doing
I'm filming in a different room today
and I really want to get big sidelights
clear hate how the background is like
kinda dog but uh hmm um you know what I
just realized I was like oh it's gonna
take me so long to edit and I was like
oh damn it
how long are 10 minutes already oh my
gosh um mmm then the next point is just
putting yourself out there and then
underneath I wrote why not like I was on
a walk with Georgie this morning and we
were just talking about putting yourself
out there with boys and stuff because we
were saying like it's crazy I was like
looking through old photos I was like I
swear I used to like like date guys a
whole lot more like go on dates and like
hang out and chat with a whole lot more
guys and now it's like I just don't
really anywhere as much anymore I was
like what's the difference why is it
changed I was like because I'm literally
not putting myself out there anymore
like half of the time in the past I was
the one creating the conversations cuz I
was like feel as I was like I want this
I'm gonna make this happen like I'm not
gonna waiter up some guy and now it's
like this whole thing like you have to
wait for the boy to message you like
it's all in there
like low and I'm like that like
it's if you want to be equal with the
male and you want equality and you want
all of that then why should there be
these rules around like the guy has to
do this and the girls expected to do
this it's like the like it then
probably just as scared as we are as you
are like in different situations like I
just feel like being fearless with that
stuff and just not not having all these
like social constructs around it like
just obviously there's still different
things that you expect a male to be
courteous about or women to doing things
and like this everyone has their roles
but the mini you can kind of break it
down just be like it just kind
of makes you more fearless I think and
that whole thing just remember like why
not what have I got to lose
what will it actually help me gain maybe
it's not going to work out but I'll have
tried it and it's a challenge for myself
kind of thing um and the next point is
I'm not perfect
oh wait no hold on oh wait well yeah it
was more about like perfection the idea
of perfection it's like none of us are
perfect I'm not perfect you're not
perfect no one is we have incredible
flaws and we have incredible strengths
and I think that that's that's what
makes you you and we are as individuals
the only one of ourselves there's no
other Katya Milan that has big freaking
eyebrows and brown hair and weird crazy
colored eyes you know like I am me and
this is the only one so there's no point
in trying to be a perfect object that's
being constructed by other people's
minds and being put onto social media
and then that has been like okay like
this is perfect like it's how how one
person's are a few people's constructed
idea of perfection at altru we have so
many different cultures and societies
and all different types of people in
this life and when you go off media
media is a totally westernizing like
when you look online you screw up your
Instagram feed all that is so
westernized and it's the it's it's a
Western mindset of perfection but I just
yeah I'm just rambling but I'm just
trying to say like you're enough in you
and
and that's what my journey has always
been has been growing up and being told
that I wasn't good enough as who I was
and then finding my way to loving myself
and then I loved myself and I was so
strong with that and then I got kicked
off my podium and I had to start again
and so now and that happens you know
like it's sometimes even when you feel
like you're so at a place you're like
yes you know like happens and
sometimes that can be taken away but
them if you stress about it it's going
to become worse but if you accept what's
happened you can move on and you start
again and it only makes you stronger
because you know how to do it you take
the information you learnt laughter and
you reapply and that's what I'm doing at
the moment I'm coming back like coming
back into myself and finding my power
again and my love again and I can't even
tell you how happy that I am like I'm
actually succeeding with that while I
did not want to get emotional when I
didn't think that's what happened but um
a lot of you guys know like you picked
it up in my videos I wasn't myself for
three months there when I like was in LA
when I came back just because I'm so
young and I was learning so much all at
once and also finding myself and my who
I was and who I wanted to be and what I
went to posting just moving around and
all this it's a lot and I didn't give
myself the time to accept that and so I
kind of just derailed like my mind
fogged I had no self-love I was doubting
everything I was doing I was doubting
everything in my life and it was just a
very time in my head and it was
really sad and it was really depressing
and it was like cardio was in there and
she was like cooling out I just couldn't
grab her and I just had to go back to
the basics I went straight back to not
doing what I knew was best for me
eat healthy eating exercise positive
affirmations of myself riding going to
the beach making videos doing fun things
being spontaneous and just backing
myself and slowly over time this built
off and I'm finally like feeling it and
it's just like the most incredible thing
for me because all I ever want in this
life and all I ever won out of my job as
well as to like be this person you guys
can relate to and feel like you know me
and that I can connect
you um share my journey to help other
people as well to make them feel good
and empowered and live this life um
fearless Li and have fun and just and
I'm like I can't even tell you that like
how excited it it is like how excited I
am to feel this feeling again
because it is invigorating and I all I
ever want us to help you guys so now
that I've finally had a point to be able
to post meaningful mindful inspiring
content again is like I'm like wow I've
been through the battlefields and I made
it out a lot of kind of things so I'm
going to talk more about um all this
stuff in depth later I'm planning on
writing a book about it and I was like
well spill the beans I really want to
and it's been something on my mind I'm
no idea how to write a book but
someone just told me though let's just
start writing and I was like I will I'm
just gonna try and start collecting
ideas up and then one day hopefully I'll
have a book to present you guys on god
knows what it would even say but um yeah
I think that's all I'm going to talk
back since what in 16 minutes now and I
ramble way too much and this was just
kind of more like a little I keep
lowering down some like guys I've got
hair like what I'm like sitting here I'm
like it looks like I'm just like I don't
know but um I'm um um um I'll be talking
