a big walk along the beach before we go
to breakfast and son
a little bit every morning we've been
going for a big walk on the beach it's
just so nice I heard a with some
activity everyone always ask me how to
stay motivated while you're on holidays
to keep fit and meditate and all that
seeing as I work like I yes I go on
holidays but I don't really stop working
like every holidays are working holiday
for me I'm always editing at night I'll
take time during the day so I need to
make sure that I'm on to my stuff so
meditation exercise helps me be
productive and clear my mind so that's
my little reason why I do that the air
