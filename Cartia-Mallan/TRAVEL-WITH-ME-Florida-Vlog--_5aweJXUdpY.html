above my head but let me explain we are
here with modulus magazine and brought
up on a trip with a few other bloggers
we've got four days here in Florida so
decides look at you guys obviously we're
just going to try and have some chill
time get grounded by the beach do some

the plate on the fly and I realized hey
summer solstice there's so much crazy
like cosmic shifting stuff going on I'm
like this is just like not set hold this

everything happens for some weird design
reasons you know ha ha they hi to the

to the gym the chatter on FaceTime with
theosophy and now I'm about to get ready
for the day I just actually also ordered
some room service as well as some
coffees and green tea and we have a
pretty chill day we just have to meet
everyone at 12 o'clock to lunch and then
I think we have a photo shoot I'm going
to film some outfit shots like helps an
outfit lookbook video so stuff happening
here and then I think we have some chill
time I always go down to the beach
breakfast with a beautiful view it's so
nice and still eat healthy on holidays
and prints I've ordered some oats and
just asked for a side some berries and
some almond milk
wait I feel smoke content right now that
feels so good that I have worked out and
I'm eating something clean who's the
worst thing is like it's my diet when
I'm at home is close super clean
if I come for the season and just start
eating again my body is going to be
so out of it and still close especially
while flying so being able to eat clean
my holidays
so tease me and it makes me feel so much
better off okay so I've just finished
getting ready and I'm just waiting for
nut and we're going to go out for lunch
and I got look at this like literally a
freaking dream the weather is so nice
today what I'm wearing today I just got
my princess Polly crawl a whole bunch of
necklaces my earrings this is from
misguided it's got is from Colleen Bell
kitchen Polly you know what's up okay
first shoot is done we've had lunch I
saw my assets in the lookbook video and
I just put on my Kiki Rios women I love
the detailing on the side here is super
cute I love a bit of lessen print of
course so Leo of me and now Natalie
she's got to come here and we have to
shoot these vlogs from another phone
right now but it'll get that we'll get
it going on a boat going on a farm where
I go any good boy you go what dinner Wow
okay Lord is everybody here yes
oh I've just woken up about 15 minutes
ago and picked up my time I'm truly
sucking to use because it uploaded a
photo on Instagram like 6 a.m. in the
morning with like a big lengthy caption
and then just blacked out again and I've
worked nothing like a different view of
us I'm sucking to use and dehydrated and
supposed to be at the gym like half an
hour ago but I'm like so exhausted so
 new moon coming I'm just putting
it all on that is like a lot of energy
going on all over and space and time and
clothes on doubt I've been shooting a
lot of stuff and I'm really had any time
to stress chill so gonna have that get
dressed and my swimmers go down to the
beach for a few hours and chill and then
this afternoon we'll just you and I'll
go to the gym and all that stuff yeah
that's what's happening sleepy I'm
really scared I'm going to blackout for
another like three hours
Oh people reach together enjoy it all oh
my god like okay I packed my beach bag
and I'm going down to the beach because
I had well the Sun was like out outside
just gone really homey um
really roots but I'm sure to come back
out there and I'm just going to lay it
by the beach soak up some Sun and yeah
let's do it
literally knew my body was like cardio
you got to get to the beach but I get in
the ocean and just swim around for a bit
lay in the Sun I was about to leave the
beach earlier and my body was like no
take a break read a book and be here in
this moment and honestly I never ever
take a break for myself I really don't I
find it so hard to just chill because
hype early passionate they seem to
always like put it down to airports so
easy so as I'm doing stuff to stop
feeling me through passion I'll just
never take a break so you know most the
time I'm constantly editing or posting
writing or trying to figure out some way
that I can help other people and I
really realized it's about myself I do
do a lot of other people and I as much
as my lifestyle it's very fun and I love
it
I'm a lot of it is really energy
draining and I never give back to myself
I don't know why I don't do that and
like I do because I'm I can't treat
myself like I love myself so
much I tell myself great things every
day but I never just take time to just
enjoy things instead of constantly
thinking about what I've got to get done
and very much about living in the
present moment you guys know my little
baby now had to change my life for
myself before I got here I was like you
need to use these next few days to just
take time out for you to write to figure
out what it is within you that needs to
be released because we're about to get a
new moon and just I go back to LA just
live in New Moon so it's like a big
transformational time I just want to be
the best version of myself so I can give
to you guys more you know I want to have
enough energy so I can help people
really put it down to that I love living
a fun life but if I can't give back
to people I literally feel like
pointless like it's so hard for me to
post interim photos without writing a
huge captain up and say I don't want to
do this without having an intention
behind it or creating a purpose for it
you know I don't want to post photos of
myself and like sometimes I love doing
that so I'm like saying you look cute
but like a lot of the time like now I
want to help out anyways I'm babbling so
much believe in yourself really tap in
and listen to your intuition you can do
that by yoga meditation just breathing
being alone journaling swimming being in
nature talking to people so many ways I
highly recommend it reading you know
anything eating good food and being
happy smiling just smile make sure you
just everyday even if you said I'll
check in with you guys later the bar
ain't not and I've just come down to the
beach it moves up some hummus
raspberries carrot we're going to watch
the sunset a new moon chips becoming so
brought down our journals and we're
going to do some riding and enjoy the
ocean and yeah
we literally look like we're the Bahamas
or something morning you came up early
this morning it should go and do my
shoot for the magazine go up to the pool
area quickly get some shots they're
doing a spread on each of the girls that
came on the trip you're just finishing
the hello I going through all the photos
so Natalie and I can come down to the
beach and swimming and tanning for a bit
the beautiful they say is our last full
day here in Florida tomorrow we're going
to Miami I'm seeing when natalie has
lived we're going to see a beautiful mom
and yeah and we fly back to LA for all
the craziness to happen I literally just
go here from like 6 miles away I've been
like baby I'll be up and down the beach
like a crazed I had a been flogging what
I'm filming right now I'm cutting like a
cranberry stop I'm walking up and down
the door
