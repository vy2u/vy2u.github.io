to snapchat
hey everyone I'm Connie Milan and today
I'm going to be filming a little try on
clothing haul out some clothes from
princess Polly and some thrifty clothes
and also some really beautiful jewelry
from a brand called mono crafts if you
haven't already noticed I have a
completely nude backdrop I finally kind
of got like I know 70% of my stuff all
set up and moved into my new place
environ are so exciting i luckily just
found this place as my lease and it in
my other place and it's just perfect
time before I go into America I
literally have exactly 20 days before I
leave for America right now so I'm just
trying to unpack everything and get my
life kind of sorted do just have to
quickly say if it's a bit annoying with
background noise I'm really sorry I now
have a backyard and my rooms here and
the backyards there you can kind of sit
out of the windows it's so beautiful but
there is lots of birds and sounds of
trees and stuff so I'm going to be
ordering like a microphone soon and
hopefully that'll eliminate any
background noise but just for this video
if there is some if you're not already
subscribed to my channel please don't
forget to subscribe below
I like these try and haul videos don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up
and I'll be sure to do some more let's
just jump straight into the hall
I did another huge order with princess
but it's not like a huge ones like a
medium sized order compared to what I
normally do my best thing I got for this
amazing like off the shoulder top if
everything about this shirt is the beige
color of it I think it just it goes
really well with my new her really
obsessed with having a fringe it's a
little update and I've gotten used to
having it now so we all good but of the
detailing that it has here I think it
just adds something more to our sizes
also I'm a tidy man you can like you
don't want it bell sleeve you can tie it
up like this so the second item that I
have is this little crop shirt it is
freaking awesome
it just says good vibes and I love the
print of the shirt it's super seventies
like totally off my alley in myself I
love this little shirt it looks so epic
with like flares or pair of jeans like a
jacket over it or something and I just
love the color of this it's so vibrant
so epic like for the beach or for a
festival can the next track that I have
from princess Polly is just this tea
from the brand motel and it says not
yours I am honestly like a t-shirt
hoarder I have a whole entire drawer
dedicated to all my T's andmy baron tees
and all the t's I collect from my pop
shops and stuff I feel like they're just
always so handy and it's the ones I
think I love what says I don't know
yours I think into like as much as I'm
into like kind of bohemian styling stuff
I'm very much into like more of a grungy
side but next I have this epic bodysuit
also from princess Polly and I think
they also have this and why it kind of
like a swimsuit but it's a bodysuit I
love this I think it sits really nicely
under way around the boot section I have
to wear a bra with or anything perfect
for winter all summer like boom looks
like something if you want it like that
really tight fitted look um I just think
it's really beautiful and it's just a
good basic to have you can style it up
with honestly anything I just look
really cool the last shirt that I have
in this boy and this has to be my
favorite one just because we're coming
into winter here in Australia and Byron
does get pretty cold around nighttime
I'm just obsessed with turtlenecks I had
this um cropped turtleneck little tight
black t-shirt I absolutely am obsessed
with this it's just such a good basic
and it's so warm while starving so light
and it's um it's by the brand Ming ping
I've already worn this so much since
I've had it in the past few days and you
can dress it up really easy like I love
wearing this with um my like denim dress
over in my hoop earrings and my boots
and somehow it's like casual but like
dressy at the same time the last piece
of clothing it from Princess Leia that I
have is also freaking epic I'm obsessed
with these they're just these black
flares flare pants um they're very long
how these pants managed to make my legs
look like 20 times longer than what they
actually are
I have quite a few pairs of players and
I've had a few black ones over my time
but the thing I love about these is the
material of them and not just like a
like cotton material
a bit like thicker and they kind of suck
you in a little better I feel but those
pants want us to go with anything I love
wearing big t-shirts with them next I
have four pieces of jewelry from
princess Polly that I'm going to show
you your thing I just have this really
cool choker necklace I ordered this
because I I don't normally wear like
black chokers some reason they look kind
of goth on me but I just thought I'd try
this out for winter I just sort of look
really cool on a model on their website
yeah just to dress it up up a little bit
make it look a little bit more edgy so
these cute little earrings that Lee also
added in those pop them in for me
because these cute little cactus
earrings and they're pink and I just
think they're really really really sweet
the fact that they're pink like a nice
light pink it's just like something
different especially in winter like I
sometimes forget to add color so like
accessories that have some color in them
it was always hi nice and finally a huge
favorite of mine you guys almost
definitely would have seen me wear one
of these before it's just one of the
rough necklaces that princess Polly stok
and I absolutely love this my other wrap
necklace that I had from there broke a
little while ago it's a slightly tiered
a little too tight um but this material
this one feels a lot thicker and a bit
stronger than the other ones
um this is in like the light like tan
brown color but they have like pink ones
and white ones and I honestly am
obsessed with wrap necklaces I feel like
if you're wearing a piece get like it
could go there you go with literally
anything it just adds a really cool
layer to it without having too much
jewelry as usual get 20% off princess
pull a fuse Dakota cardio poly um all
uppercase letters and then I'll give you
20% of a couple of discount code for you
guys moving on the next pieces I'm going
to show you are so beautiful and I'm so
obsessed with them be very showing you
guys some jewelry that I picked up from
mono crafts um mono crafts is a jewelry
line designed by a really wonderful
amazing lady chimera Westhoff she
designs and creates and hand makes all
this incredible joy it's all sterling
silver and it's just such like it has
the most interesting lines and really
interesting delicate details to us so if
you're a fan of like really delicate
jewelry she says that a lot of her joy
is kind of inspired by tribes
architecture music and shadows and she
comes up with different shapes and
different designs and then we'll draw
them an enduring kind of experiment in
that way I think what I really loved
about Meryl and why I like just have
such a strong connection with this dream
I really adore it is because there's so
much passion behind it like this is her
passion is making this jewelry and I
just wanted to give a little blurb about
it because I just think it's incredible
and she's such a lovely lady and I'm so
lucky to have been gifted some of these
beautiful pieces I wear at least one of
the pieces almost every day so I'm going
to jump in and show you the jewelry is
these are the most incredible hoop
earrings I have ever worn they're all
completely sterling silver they're a
little bit heavy but you kind of get
really used to them other than are just
normal hoop so a little bit wider a bit
thicker and I have a detailing kind of
like line in the middle they're really
quite large so there's such a statement
piece next I have one of her little ear
cuffs just heat of air cops in the line
on there some like way bigger ones I
think this is one of the really small
ones and this is one that you can just
slip kind of over your ear you lettuce
looks so epic it just adds an extra
layer to kind of your drawing something
I think it's such a statement I have
their little cross earring and it's so
weird
two of my roommates also have this
earring we all have one only thing is
with me is that I haven't figured out
how to put it in it's so intricate and
like designed design so amazingly that
it's there's like a little secret behind
putting it in and I have to actually ask
her one more time I just go look at like
Giorgio Nicole's ear and like try and
figure it out but in a photo a bit here
so you can see what it looks like
because I've not yet mastered how to put
this little baby in Helsley I have one
more of the earrings in my ear so I pick
this earring is like a little circle and
two lines hanging up it's so beautiful
and delicate this one is great if you
have first and seconds peers because you
can hook one line into the first and
then one line into
second if you have just one piercing it
might work if you put them both in the
same might feel a bit weird I'm not sure
if it works we can give it a try I'm so
obsessed with this as well so yeah
that's all the Mike after that I got
only I have some options and this is
this awesome like laced up Bell sleeve
leopard print shirt this is so cool when
I grabbed it off the hook I was like oh
my god I know this is going to be so
cool it looks awesome with like jeans or
Flair next I have like a bigger sized
version of that other like black
turtleneck shadow showed you earlier
this one's like way bigger and looser
more like a big jump and this is just so
cool in such a good peaceful winter and
then lastly I am obsessed with this
jacket it's just this cream-colored
cutting jacket and it looks really nice
with everything as well and I love how
warm it is I'm obsessed with this like
kind of like beige creamy color at the
moment it just like looks really cool of
my hair so that's everything for my
travel today I hope you guys enjoyed um
I will be hopefully having videos coming
out really soon everyone's been kind of
asking like why have you stopped posting
twice a week and that's simply because
I've just been moving houses and it's
been really hectic moving houses always
such a big deal not only like moving
stuff but mentally it just takes a while
to kind of like adjust to life in a new
place and getting comfortable and stuff
and I just I'm such a perfectionist for
my videos I really prefer like quality
over quantity and you guys know that so
I hope you just don't mind for a little
bit if it's a bit like out of schedule
or not on the correct days or whatever
I'm definitely trying my hardest to get
it back on its feet and I'll have so
much amazing content um well um ever in
America yeah I'm so excited to get over
there I'm like honestly like I just
can't wait I'm just yeah over babbling
