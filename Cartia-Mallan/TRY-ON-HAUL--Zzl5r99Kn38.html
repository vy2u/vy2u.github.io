freaking everywhere so everyone has a
Daniel Wellington watch now honestly
I've always wanted to like become a
watch person again to the habit of rain

chunky Styles and like I always hate
like just metal I could just feel like
it just doesn't go with anything that I
wear I really love the brown a strapless
on the inside of here and it's just such
a like a really delicate and a simple
style bra and I work to the markets one
day I got so many compliments on its own
so I'd like gold mining around the face

proper watch talk I just I just know
that it it looks
and operate like a proper watch I really
love this look nice even just a way to
like dress up or like sophisticated
outfit a little bit more as well I also
think with these watches it's really
good idea like to give as a present like
I'm not Valentine's Day so I hope you
got like a will you got your lover be
really cute to get them like a nice
watch or something everyone seems to
struggle with like gift ideas I thought
this would be like a pretty good gift to
give someone good simple but still it's
not like giving them a gift card it's
like no I actually put it after we
finish kind of thing they're doing my
little Valentine's Day offer which is
like free gift wrapping freaks by
shipping and free return and I've also
got a sneaky little discount code for

move on to speaking about some stuff
that I got from princess Polly so I
recently spent doing shoot them and I
got some little goodies when I went into
HQ so I would show you guys what I got
first things first I picked up some Doc
Martin um these are just the low-cut doc
Montanez super install right now I
really like these because they're just
just kind of like a slip on trees they
look really cool jeans or shorts up in
literally anything they go anything and
everything like their casual but can be
dressy as well and can look cool of
different socks and stuff I was super
excited and once they started stalking
you in emails like I must get a pair
first piece from apprentice police next
thing I picked up some really beautiful
jewelry which I'm super obsessed with I
just got these two little rings and I
also got the earrings that I'm wearing
right now I'm so in love with both of
these and they're both just like
sterling silver rings and I love just
slipping these on with the good quality
and they just are really beautiful
there's any earrings a super-rad - I
literally don't take them out I just
keep them in my ear all the time just
because they're really dainty and simple
but they still add boom next things like
I was so exciting when I saw them on the
website I was like oh my god I need them
in my life I picked up these three
awesome like remakes of like vintage
tees but they're not actual vintage tees
it's like cool retro remake marks I'm
gonna solve my favorite and this is the
day tripper teenie it's so cool I love
the design of this and I love the colors
like the yellow orange and red and the
lining of each that makes it super
vintage new instant retros the next one
that is awesome a yellow one it says
take meals my everything about this is
the color I've really been getting into
this yellow lately I have like three
vintage change was coming out and I just
kind of wear them on like a little like
repeat cycle and same thing goes it's a
super soft and it looks really cool with
a lot of different things I sort of
think this one's my favorite over the
other on this one's is very fitting for
me I've went for the show in my life for
a long time and this is the bad bitch

obsessed with it I've been wearing this

tell I've sort of moved out of my teeth
like the makeup phase but I did pick up
this product it's just the Girl Meets

you like twist the bottom and it's just
a really nice light highlight I've got

congratulate back picked up these two
amazing little delicate gold chains with
amethyst on the bottom of them and they
are actually freaking donning I'm in
love with these I purchased one of their
necklaces ages ago and then when I was
in Bali they got in touch with me and
said would you like some of our pieces
and I was like hey yes please of course
so yeah they sent me these two beautiful
pieces and if you saw the shoot that I
did with Gabby we use these they're so
delicate and so simple but they really
bringing out the tea and make it look so
stunning and I thought I'll just add in

your pants I wore them and I just got
two dresses of exhaust the first one is
just this really simple maxi dress again
extremely cut one and it's so simple
it's just a long maxi dress with two
slits on the side put a little print and
it's just I'm more or less like the
green color of it so that one then the
second one is awesome it's this longer
denim dress and like everything about
