I'm definitely going to film a lookbook
for you guys when I get to New York with
some of these clothing items um but just
like my last haul vo I'm going to just
talk to you about the company that I got
them from or where I got them from and
then just show you all of the items just
with music over cuz that's what I prefer
seeing rather than just like me blabbing
on about the items like you can see them
so yeah yeah so the first company that I
have poster arm is of course princess
Polly and super it in love with all the
products that I've gotten from them I've
just gone flake lots of little flowy
t-shirts and stuff um that I can just
pay off my jeans or some pants or skirt
and this will be really great for this
like walking around New York and stuff
like cute little flowy tops and whatnot
because the weather there is kind of
going into winter but it's still kind of
sunny and stuff so it'll be perfect for
that I mean stop rustling your crackers
I don't think it matters it's like such
a cache like but I get 20% of princess
plays website just use the code Carty
for dancing cartoon go ahead and have
big shopping spree and
enjoy that thank you later thank you
thank you later
now I'm just going to jump in to trying
on all the clothes for you guys and I
also I'll just mention all the products
will be listed in the down box from all
of the companies that I've gotten stuff
from
not a cuisine sesang
I can't
for
to
okay so that is all the pose I got from
princess Polly now I'm going to be
showing you guys some items that I
picked up from Arnhem clothing and I
love autumn they're like a barren Bay
based clothing store I'm sure a lot of
you guys know them the most beautiful
clothes and like really stunning
patterns of their clothes I just picked
up heaps of items from them before I
left Byron and what I love about Adams
clothing is that with a lot of the
kimonos and stuff they can be worn as
like kimonos as dresses or as tie up
shirts like there's it's so versatile
and you can dress them up you can wear
them to the beach like over swimmers and
stuff like they're just really really
practical and re wearable clothing items
and also the fabric I can't even explain
it to you it feels like silky like it's
so soft and so lightweight and it's just
beautiful you guys will see the items
that I got but I also have a discount
code for Arnim for you guys and that is
also 20% off when you use the code card
er I love about Adams clothing as well
as just the prints on them there's such
beautiful like earthy tones and also
super colorful and bright and it is so
fun and I love adding a bit of color
into my wardrobe literally when you walk
into their store and bar and it's all
just colorful like there's nothing
that's just black and white it's also
colorful and beautiful and I love that
constantly
but that is all of the clothing items
that I picked up from Arnhem now I'm
going to be showing you guys some stuff
that I got from a little store called
her pony and I actually got stuff from
them ages ago and I think I might have
featured it in a whole like way way ago
but I have collaborated with them again
for this haul they've just actually
opened up a really little pop-up store
in byron and it is the cutest little
store it's just in the Industrial Estate
in Bombay
I'll leave the address down below where
you can go check it out love all of her
ponies stuff is so uniquely different to
a lot of other stores they come up with
just these really random like one-off
pieces which I love the one amazing
thing about them is that it's actually
so reasonably priced and I respect that
so much like yeah they could be quite
expensive but they keep their prices
super affordable and I love that and
somehow they've like stopped some really
epic vintage as well I don't know if
they sell the vintage stuff online but I
know they have it
in barns pop-up store and I think they
also have a store in Melbourne or Sydney
I permit I label the information down
below but I will now jump in and show
you guys the products that I got from
them
okay
the final store that I got some stuff
from is actually some jewelry products
and this is from thorne Starr and oh my
god I am in love with their jewelry it
is the coolest stuff these earrings are
actually from them and they just it's so
my style of jewelry and I freaking love
it
they have heaps of like just really
unique one-off type pieces really cool
like star and like different moon
earrings and lots of art really epic big
chokers I think what's so great about
their jewelry is that yeah it's you
can't find stuff like this anywhere else
you can put all of the jewelry with so
many different outfits and what I love
about it is that pieces are such
statements you can have a really simple
outfit and just put one of their pieces
on it just kind of like completes it
like with these earrings right now like
this would be a really boring white
shirt but then the earrings just
completely glam it up and make it kind
of cool so yeah I'm gonna jump in now
and show you guys all the jewelry that I
got from fawn star and yeah
I can't
to
so that is all the jury from porn star
and that is everything for this whole
video I hope you guys enjoyed seeing
some of my new products that I've picked
up and I'm super excited to kind of wrap
all these items when I go to New York
and this week in Sydney and I will I
honestly I'm going to promise it on this
video so I actually do it I'm going to
film a lookbook in New York with these
pieces and also I'll pick up some well

vintage shopping over there so I'll try
