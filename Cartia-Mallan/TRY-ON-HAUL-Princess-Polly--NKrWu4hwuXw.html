sorry for the delay in videos I have
been so very busy
this is my first video of 2015 that is
just crazy it's doesn't really feel like
2015 yeah but oh well um I have a little
update for you guys before I jump into
this video so here's the update just
gotten back from Fall Festival like
yesterday and I'm so busy I still
haven't even unpacked my bag I got so
much stuff to get done but I wanted to
get some videos up for you guys before I
went to Sydney which I leave on I leave
on Friday so it's Wednesday today so I
would a lot to get done before then most
of you may know before when I was in
France I posted a limit on photos saying
send me some pio box letters I'm gonna
be doing a peer box opening saying that
I'm so upset would be a complete
understatement for this situation but
when I go back from France I got all of
your letters and I filmed my pair of box
opening video and then I didn't have
enough time to edit it while before I
went to fall so I kept all the footage
on my SD card and then while I was at
Fool's I accidentally deleted everything
off my SD card including all the letters
that I'd opened and I was just like
really you want to do this right now
like it was just I was so I was so upset
trust me but I was so excited two points
that because you guys sent me the most
amazing letters and some really nice
gifts and I had did this big video
saying thank you I was like my end of
your video
and then it all got ruined because it'll
delete them there's the update there
will not be a peer box opening letter
video because I can't really reopen the
letters and like fake my reaction and it
was all kind of like I had to be like a
genuine her think so a quick message in
this video to everyone that sent me a
letter thank you so much I've read all
of them I cried and a lot of them teed
off but really happy and a lot of them
and thank you to everyone that sent me
little gifts and just you hope for that
I'm going to try and post more videos
reply to more comments I hope you all
can understand and forgive me I'm very
sorry today I just have a super chilled
laid-back like try and hold for you guys
I got some new clothes from princess
Polly before I went to Falls and I'm
dying to share them with you because
they're kind of perfect for like summer
so I'm sorry for my viewers if you're in
winter and in the cold temperature at
the moment but here's some inspiration
for maybe when you go into summer who
knows I'm gonna stop with the ranting
I'm gonna jump strengthen this whole
video and show you some of the new
clothes that I got and I hope you guys
enjoy it all the links for the clothes
we left down below as usual and do they
stop what I got from Princess Leia with
this little play set that I'm wearing
now maids let us start off from learning
so it is just this really adorable
long-sleeved leopard print
place it and if you guys know me you
know I love my leopard print so the
minute I saw this I was like I need that
in my life right now
yeah so it's got this little tie up the
top near the middle it's just like
little classic play so it's super cute I
love it for summer like even though it's
got the long sleeve it's really airy so
it's not too hot it's just cute and
short and the fabric is soft on the skin
it's not like itchy or anything so yeah
that's that second layer I got from
princess Polly it was this incredible
mink pink shirt so it is just a
off-the-shoulder shirt like this the
fabric is so soft and look at the colors
on this it is so beautiful and so
perfect for summer you got lots of
vibrant oranges and pinks and blues and
greens this is like the kind of the same
sleeve as this one it's really open and
flowy so once again even though it's
long-sleeve it doesn't get too hot I got
mine in a size medium and it's actually
really quite big across the shoulders
like I'm quite broad and I was thinking
like doing it a larger and in a medium
but if you're small or across the
shoulders I would suggest getting the
small size because this is really
stretchy and really quite big across the
shoulders and if you've got a bigger
bust like myself these shown is perfect
I know that sometimes I can't really
wear off the shoulder stuff just because
it doesn't hold up my boobs well enough
but this has like plenty of enough
material in that space and as I said
since it's broader it can really fit it
perfectly so it's such an awesome shirt
I love it it's my current favorite and
I'm so excited to end out more it is
adorable
I would pay that little show up with
from shorts or this other denim skirt
that I got off princess Polly it is the
label Polly so princess police actual
label there's cute little denim skirt
and it is just a really nice light blue
denim tone it's a really nice soft denim
hey I got a size 12 because I wasn't
sure if it was gonna be like Sundance
had some really tight around like area
and I was like I need bigger space my
legs but
small space my waist definitely should
have gone with a size 10 because my wife
sees a lot smaller and this is a little
bit loose around my way so I know I
might have to wear like a belt but
around the legs it's more of an a-line
like it doesn't go tight in it kind of
goes out a little
it's actually really fluttering it for
someone if you have bigger legs like
myself I kind of need that shape I don't
it doesn't suit me as much if it's just
like sucked in really tight but I'm
saying that it would really suit you
have a smaller frame around your legs as
well it's a really cute just good skirt
and it's got the buttons all in the
middle it goes with everything like all
my shirts of pet with this perfectly
just one of those like things that you
have them in your wardrobe that you're
like you got a shirt and you're like
what can I pass a can I calm my denim
skirt yeah it's always got my back so
yeah that's that next up from I'm Polly
the label as well I got this adorable
little off the shoulder summer blue
dress it is super cute it's got these
little flower pattern detailing on it
and I was really surprised at this dress
like when I ordered I was high on it and
I like I liked how it looked on the
model and I was like I'm not sure if
this is same a because sometimes dresses
like this make me look chunky ah around
yeah because I need to have in more fine
and waistline but I totally didn't
realize when I was looking online that
in the middle of this dress it actually
has a elastic band so it's kind of so it
does actually pull your waist in and
it's great because if you are like a bit
shorter you can kind of tuck the fabric
under it to make the dress of it shorter
so it's not too long but it's actually a
really perfect length like I'm quite
sure as it is and I don't need to adjust
and settle I love to pay this dress with
a little black belt because it just adds
something to it or it would even look
really nice with a little Troy car or
hat or anything it's just the classic
really cute summer dress next up I have
this to-die-for
bohemian kind of teal green
blue maxi skirt it's super long a little
bit too long for me which I suck swim so
short but I have to just tie up one of
the sides of the slit so pretty much
this skirt has four slits in a net so
there's two slits at the front and two
slits at the back I really like how it
does I add something what are the skirt
kind of gives gives a bit of you know
it's confidence something this skirt is
so beautiful it feels so nice on the
fabrics really nice and thin and not hot
at all it's a really cool fabric I love
the print on this and I think it goes
with lots of lots of little crop tops
shirt finally the last little crop shirt
that I have that I like to pair that
maxi square with is this super adorable
really like practical black crop I love
this one because it can be worn really
casually or it can be worn kind of more
dressy because it does have this nice
high neck sort of detailing thing it is
such a flattering shirt and perfect to
wear with a strapless bra because it
actually covers all of the bands like
you know how sometimes when you get a
like a crop it'll cut down really low
I'm here and your brass sticks out and
it's so just like can you not this
sounds perfect it covers everything
covers your back and front and I love it
I can always just pop it on with
anything it's so nice so comfy and it
has a nice little it's just a basic zip
down the back so they're all the new
clothes that I got from princess Polly I
hope you guys enjoyed seeing some of the
new pieces that I got and hopefully you
can use those some inspiration for
summer if you're not in some right now

clothes that I showed you guys I hope
