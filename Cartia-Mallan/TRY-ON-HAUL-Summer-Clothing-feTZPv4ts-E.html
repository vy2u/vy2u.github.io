channel I'm cutting Milan and today I'm
going to be filming a try on whole video
for you guys the stuff in my eye oh my
god oh my god oh my god
I swear I literally like getting stopped
sucking my head is like a daily thing so
my friends over princess Polly sent me
across some things for the summer break
I'm going to be on the valet festival
and it's just I've been going to the
beach a lot so they were like let us
turn you some summery clothes so I was
complaining I literally had nothing I
was like I may as well just film a hole
for you guys because I know you guys
always love saying try on holes I love
filming try on holes as always got a
code just can't code the princess Polly
and that'll just a 20% off I'm not sure
what the code is I'm gonna have it
written here cuz I'm unorganized and I
don't know it's like cardio something
cardiod something and 20% I don't know
yeah let's jump into the first Adam's
right okay so the first item I have is
this cute little crop top it's just an
all white lace up crop top with like a
mesh doubt back I honestly don't only
wear long long shirts ever I'm a crop
girl I always wear crop tees crop shirts
I really love having ones like this
because that you can I always wear
high-waisted pants and skirts denim
skirts so it's perfect just as something
basic to look on this is perfect for
summer it's nice and cool and yet white
and the lace up is very in trend at the
moment so it's perfect for festival as
well as the first I am I love that
excited to wear this for the summer
I honestly go through phases normally I
don't like wearing short skirts but
lately I've been wearing lots of short
skirts just because it's so easy for
summer and it's so easy to suck on
shirts with them so this is the next one
it is like a little white wrap skirt
type of thing so it's got a little like
crossover thing you can tie it on either
side the material limit is like super
lightweight once again easy to pair with
everything and since it has that little
tie it almost kind of dresses it up a
little bit more as well so it could be
more of a dressy thing you can put like
a body suit under it I've always served
badan holes with like explaining the
clothes like what I can put them with my
hair is driving me literally insane
today it just is sitting like I don't
even know
next I have this really cute little
peeny toe this is by the bird make pink
and I love this cause underwire I've
always made underwire and any swims that
I get because I got big old titties they
need something to hold them up like the
print of this I kind of loved pink sand
blue kind of times I normally like to
keep mice from a pretty basic but you
see the style of it is really fluttering
and yeah
love the tie and I'm going to tighten it
or loosen it and having adjustable
straps is a must for me because I have
to hitch everything up tight so it holds
my tits in I want any like huge fall
outs while you're at the beach and stuff
so yeah next I have a super cute little
of the shoulder crop and it's just super
simple it looks like this with the
stretchy arms I like this because of the
color I think this peachy tone is really
nice and you've got a tan looks great
with denim kind of always tend to go for
buying clothes that can be dressed up
and dressed down because it's just way
more versatile and yeah hipa comfortable
and casual and just perfect for a beach
day next I have these really cute little
pair of black pants with tip acute
frills on the bottom like a silky
material they're really really
comfortable and personally I think
they're really flattering on and these
look so cool with like big black chunky
boots with a little crop but you could
also do it really casual as well we're
just like sandals and another nice shirt
with like bikinis or swimmers so yeah I
love these your next shot I have is this
really cool sequin crop top with a criss
cross back and this is by the brand
motel and you guys know I love glittery
stuff it's like a gray glittery sequin
top tip super comfortable I love that
you can you have to wear a bra and you
can just kind of like tighten up the
back to hold everything up and I got
that show in mind to wear a hat beyond
the valley possibly if not good for
events good for when you're feeling like
you need a little bit of shimmer
glittery sparkles etc
one is a super cute next little kind of
wrap up t-shirt that I have is this
black one I'm still trying to figure out
what kind of bra I can wear under this
because it's not supportive enough for
my boobs unfortunately but it is the
cutest thing ever
it just unties in the middle so you can
adjust it to fit your boobs really
simple adjustable straps once again I
love this so much I just
my boobs are literally the bane of my
existence as obvious with like me
talking about boobs tangle which is
super here is these Oh wrong way is
these overalls from a some days loving
so really really different too much
overalls I have because they're actually
kind of structured like like
high-waisted shorts with a very short
top part the top part actually sits
under here like it doesn't come up to
here like most overalls do so you
definitely have to wear like a shirt
under and it's quite a lot shorter so
it's just like wearing like short shorts
with a little thing only good for a
beach table ok the next dress I got I
haven't gotten something like this in
ages because I don't actually wear that
many dresses are all I don't really wear
big flowy dresses and wanted to pick
this up because I thought it'd be really
cute just for like a family lunch or if
I was feeling like wearing something
bright and very bohemian and it's just
this well it's all twisted big pink maxi
dress and on the website they styled it
off the shoulder and they kind of warm
with the belt a chisel and the waist
which i think is best but I think it's
actually supposed to sit like that on
but you can definitely put it off the
shoulder and just tighten this thing up
in the middle but I definitely recommend
wearing it with a belt otherwise it
looks a little bit suckish looking
because it's quite quite big you've
always nice to have a little bit of pink
in your wardrobe and it's super comfy
you feel very flowy and lovely in it
which is always nice the fabric of it is
so soft and comfortable which is perfect
and you can dress that up dress down for
a beach day literally everything in this
you can do for that so that's definitely
what I shop for and then I also just
picked up one pair of shoes and I've
been going to a lot more events it's
always kind of good just to have a
staple pair of heels if I need to go to
something a little bit dressier because
you go
no I normally live in my boots like I
wear chunky boots actually everywhere so
I just picked up these windsor-smith
heels that have like little crossover
tie-up which these are just comfort
deluxe like they look sleek any casual
but dressy but they're just comfy which
is what I look for in heels because
really don't wear heels very often I fit
they're black with the wooden kind of
heel he looks really really nice and
goes with my style
really well then the last item is just
this polka dot place that I have on here
I'm obsessed with this it has a really
low drop back super plunge v-neck I've
tightened this up a lot because I
normally would need a bra their solution
is very low plunge and then it has a
little thing we can tighten it around
the waist this I would probably never
really wear out because it's way too
short on me it's perfect for a beach
like I probably just wear like a
spaghetti kind of strap bikini top it's
like a triangle bikini top under this to
keep my boobs up if I was right just
with swimmers um besides that I probably
would not wear this out unless like it
magically got longer or is shrunk
because it's way too short
um but you never know I love the color
of this I love the style of this I just
think it's really really cute no I don't
ever wear polka dot size like nothing
polka dot but only perfect and summery
