today I'm going to be speaking to you
guys about a very important topic and
that is that it's run by us taking
control of your life and taking control
of your dreams your ambitions what you
want to do and just everything in that
kind of realm but now my camera is
flashing and it's about to die that's
great let's see how much we can get
through it before it does okay so I'm
sure we've all had people among friends
everyone it caters to you once twice or
probably like a few times in your life
that the well doesn't revolve around you
you all know we can't do that because
the world doesn't revolve around you
blah blah blah blah we always hear this
term the world doesn't revolve around
you
CLC says demised a legendary comment we
I think someone has said that and she
goes well yet my world does revolve
around me or she said in some sort of
term like this and it really got me
thinking but I had you out to give
credit to selfie for this thought
pattern because it kind of instill this
other thing I mean it made me think
about more that's what I was told about
today so I asked her about the idea of
the world revolving around you and why
the world actually does revolve around
you so I want to finally start with the
idea of when people say to use the word
doesn't revolve around you depending on
what the matter of the subject is or
what it is they're occurring to feel
like what it does is it really shuts
down someone's individual importance so
saying love of Allah you are just not
been wanting to be quiet the idea is
that Sophie and I were kind of talking
about is that the world literally does
evolve around you your world revolves
around you
so and you know what the thing is that
the only world that you have is your
world I will never be able to experience
someone else's world I'll never be able
to understand what someone else's world
is like the only world I really do have
is my own world and if you really have
to think in words about it it's about
the world that you experience within
your mind within your body the feelings
you have the people you encounter and
all that stuff very well
literally just dozen and I went to go
and buy my childhood I was serving on my
blogging camera and I misplaced it the
charge up for the whole cameras I'm
trimming on my big camera now the
quality is actually probably a little
bit I don't know why did someone buy the
camera but oh well
let's go kind of get back to what we're
talking about and I actually just
re-watch the footage of what we just
watched and I just want to emphasize
before we continue that when I talk
about the idea of your of the world
revolving around here obviously the
world hi entire world does not revolve
around your one only existence and that
everything should be catered here to you
and blah blah I mean that your world and
the world which is all we know is our
truth is our world revolved Ronnie just
wanted to clear up I'm sure it made
sense and just clarify it
your world is the only world that you're
ever going to have and it is extremely
important to be compassionate be caring
for other people and to be considerate
and helpful and kind of logo over but
why do we always put our dreams our
ambitions what we truly want on hold for
everyone else all the time we are
brought up to be slaves for everyone
else besides ourselves
we're brought up to compliment others
and not compliment ourselves we love
looking after people and helping people
as much as I can but why do we do that
and another thing maybe we should do
that myself like I think having those
aspects of so important that giving back
yourself equally as much is just as
important a lot of the time we put our
happiness on hold so that we can follow
out someone else's vision to how they
see our life and how they want our lives
to unfold parents friends other family
members or even schooling by the time we
all do it's our social conditioning the
way they were brought up everything but
what that then ends up doing is that
it's ingraining fear into us because
then when we finally do really get
frustrated that we're not doing what we
truly love or what we really want to be
doing for our and happiness
that we have so much fear of judgment
then and it's just this really it
becomes so much harder to know so
through when you finally get some wind
oh it I'm going to do my love I'm
going to put myself first it becomes a
huge horrifying big battle to go up
against and it becomes harder than what
it should be or at least our mind makes
it feel harder than it should be why do
we get so caught up in the idea of
judgment and in all that and obviously
it can it can feel hard and it can feel
scary but the thing is that I kind of
came to the conclusion was and I still
remind myself of this when I start
judging myself or comparing myself to
other people the path that I've chosen
for my life okay I really don't know
what is going on with this camera I just
have to stop it because the whole thing
fogged up I don't know what is going on
with technology today when you are on
the path to taking control of your life
you cannot pay attention to the people
that are bringing you down or judging
you it's just like having a bully in
school when you when they say fine meet
you and you react that's how to get they
take so someone that is judgmental if
you pay attention to that judgment and
you let them stop you from doing the
thing that you're trying to project or
do they take that as the bigger picture
because they're like getting so excited
section over the fact that you are
caring so much about what they think
about like when I started YouTube and
everything and so many people be quite
rude to me about it and they picked on
me for it they were horrible about it
that I was committed to the vision that
I what I wanted to do in my life pop I
knew that I wanted to help me born that
I wanted to have a really creative
outlet and the way that I could do that
was through YouTube it enabled us for me
to open up other opportunities for me
and so sometimes the path you take to
get to the destination that you want can
be something that you don't expect I
would have never expected to have done
YouTube to then do acting - then do
presentations and public speaking and
just in general kind of like promote
others messages and stuff but that's the
part that was planned out to me and now
that I can realize that this is my life
this is my world I have to do things
that sue me and going to work for me and
I can help people and I can be a good
human in this world and I can pull out
my pop because this is my journey like
if I hadn't listened to everyone else to
put everyone else stuff in my life I
would be sitting here making this video
for you right now which in time might
actually help you go out and live your
life properly and inspire a thought in
you that you never had before you know I
mean so everything is just so
intertwined but I just want to think
about this I think it'd be I didn't
airplanes that when they put on your
safety mops before you can help others
if you're breathing well you can help a
young child or an infant next to you
instead if you help them first you might
die
it's such a more good way to put it like
obviously less pleasant extreme but like
you constantly live your life trying to
please everyone around you then you end
up helping them get to a happy place and
then where you live you learn what you
love you're stuck in town you don't want
to be and if this you limit your entire
life when you're left to be just
everything that you dreamt up and better
because the thing is you have to
understand is that we don't like to
acknowledge the fact that magic is real
and that your dreams can actually come
true and I'm here to tell you that they
don't just have to be dreams have the
biggest dream ever and just chase it
down like you're capable of anything at
all using your ego for the right reasons
so to boost your confidence and to
sometimes I'll even tell myself like are
we really eager to tickle in my reminds
myself just I was like a little trick to
make myself so Mahatma's but you you're
killing it like you were doing the
amazing things you were the greatest
person like you're surrounded by
incredible people you're so lucky and
it's almost like gratitude for self and
just like being really like extra and
kind to yourself for once it's not
really about it's not ego in terms as
I'm better than this person or I need to
go and do this so that it makes this
person to like shift so you need a
really careful about the way that you
let your mind view people and be
yourself
maybe ego and stuff like that is another
video so it's not exactly what I'm kind
of time but everything myself is do I
manage my bubble
like everything leaks up with everything
and how to do self-love and how to do
stuff so I have a few videos already up
that talk about stuff like this two old
bills on each other so I think if you
haven't really seen myself love videos
on watch that because I still think that
is step one to anything that you do with
any of this self development taking over
your life world domination
yeah hopefully this helps you kind of
just get some power in yourself and
stand your ground and don't let people
decide your life path for you you know
in your heart so what your what your
calling is and if you don't know it yet
you will find it but if you continue to
let people boss you around or tell you
what's right for you to do it's going to
be harder to group Griffon and
confidently be able to executors
actually kind of quote that can nicely
summarized this video for us that I
really loved it sounded on tumblr today
and it says never be bullied into
silence never allow yourself to meet a
victim expect no definition of your life
define yourself
so as I said this is blaming by the
world revolves around you you're the
only one in your world you're the only
one that's ever going to understand how
your brain works and the journey you are
going to embark on and getting anyone is
going to be ongoing experience all of
the joys and the successes and the
downfalls of sadnesses that you have
obviously people planned out but they
also focus on their own life to take
times of your life go out and live it to
the absolute fullest and just live for
moments that make you feel like it's a
dream world because we are technically
in a dream world we don't actually know
what's real what's not everybody can't
really like this really like crazy
parity theory on this but if you want to
wake up and like be happy and like love
what you're doing so I encourage you all
just to taste it on doing that and if
anyone ever says to you again the world
doesn't revolve around you can be like
well actually so but make sure you're
being kind of
everyone around you and you're in love
and it's spreading positivity and good
things will come to you good common will
come back and remember that everything
happens for weed thank you guys so much
for watching this video I'm so sorry
about all the lighting mishaps and
everything that went wrong
yeah I would love to get some
conversations in the comments flowing
about if you've kind of taken a stick in
your life to do something you love what
is it or how do you want to work your
plans to the first up you want to take
to living your dreams and just take your
charge of your world so yeah I love when
you guys will pair chat down there and
I'll get down there too so thank you so
much for sharing today I love you all so
much and I will see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
