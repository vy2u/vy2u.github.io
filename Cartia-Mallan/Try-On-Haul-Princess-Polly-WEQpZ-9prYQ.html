my short hair and everything like kind
of keep them reeling
hello everyone I hope you are doing well
we're doing a try on haul videos I have
heaps a new amazing um clothing items
but from princess Polly cuz this play is
my favorite online store I like second
family honestly know I'm stocking up on
a whole heap of clothes before I go to
LA and I'm also I tried to pick some
pieces that are suitable for winter here
and also suitable for summer because
it's obviously some are over in LA right
now but a lot of these things you can
kind of make work with both so there's
something in here for everyone before I
get started I'll mention as always I
have a 20 percent off discount hope you
guys go get all your goodie let's just
start sending through what I got
actually I might sell what I have on so
first thing I have from Polly is these
incredible earrings do they not just
scream like cardio will get these or
cardio wear these they're like little
moon and I've been that's supposed to be
like a star or a Sun and either cool
because they're gold and I have a lot of
silver jewelry and I'm chiming you see
I'm trying to switch it up with some
gold at the moment so I love these just
to add on to any outfit super cute and
then next I have this gold necklace and
this reminded me so much of see I feel
like something she would love it was
just like a little love heart with the
cross fingers the cross economy oh I
think this is just so cute I love simple
choices like this you can just add to an
outfit kind of makes it a little edgy oh
I don't know just add something extra to
it while keeping it very simple and you
know and then I have another pair of
earrings and it is just these guys but
they're really cute hoops you can never
go wrong with having a pair of hoop
earrings these are cool because the back
of them
it's just kind of like it doesn't match
all the way up but I love the size of
them the shiny kind of silver like the
long rectangular shape is so nice I've
had gold in these and I was so torn I
was like silver gold silver gold and I
was like what cereal honey you'll
probably was available so if you guys
watched my princess Polly video I went
to do that the meeting greet and we did
the benefit Polly event I was wearing
these guys these pink Sager glasses on
to Adam in this video but my ring light
just reflects and it just looks really
silly but I had these glasses when I
went to the event and I'm actually
wearing them to the event but when we're
on the bus if you remember the vlog
Renee was standing next to me on the bus
and she like slung her arm over just
like like literally just like caps it
off my head they just slowly went
pulling and I was like uh-huh
I was like please can I have another
pass because I love these I can just see
myself in LA just like anyone's them
it's just so cute and so cool as these
guys and then it's something more simple
but also these are just like sexy like I
mean just really help offices I have the
same shape but with black lenses and the
gold detailing it's funny when I just
look like straight on like this is the
matrix um but I reckon I'm gonna get so
much wear out of these that is the
accessories let's get into the clothes
and ourselves what I'm wearing I know
you all know what I'm thinking I may
have my new favorite shot on my body
right now like look at this so this is
not like stripping down just showing you
the detailing so this shirt is so cute
it is a little essentia when i saw this
online i literally died i was like that
is cardio in a teacher the rainbow
detailing is just so made is the
comfiest shirt and I like Emily it's so
much wear out of this this was like
denim over all this with just overall
dress as well they just go so cute
together and even this is just anything
I love
so much second piece is this like
pinafore II zipper caramel tone corduroy
dress and the make of it is so
flattering I just I love it I have this
little crop shirt which oh my god I love
this coffee palette that the straps are
so nice and thin not wait to wear this
just with some really cool pieces and
layer like a big kimono over it or just
a big jacket
I don't know I'm just I love this and I
think there's another color in this too
and then I was seriously in desperate
need for new denim skirt and I've always
wanted to get like a nice black denim
skirt that I can just put with
everything and this one is cute it has a
little rip in in the side here it just
sits nicely it's a really beautiful make
it's very flattering again this is my
new favorite I can see myself getting a
lot of wear out of it and then I have
this beautiful maxi dress like look at
the colors on this it just fits so
amazingly on it scoops down in a v-neck
shape purple and pink and velvet tones
which just looks so beautiful if it just
such a cute design like this front is
really longer than the back light kind
of triangles out it's already designed
to kind of tension at the waist and
fluttering and I can't wait where
there's like afternoon drinks or
something along the beach or even you
can you can dress this up so much but
you can also make it very casual I have
been searching for pants like this for
so long they are just some simple like
velvety black flared pants
absolutely love flares but I love my
black flares about a year ago now and I
was like oh my god they're just the best
able to have I love putting flares with
either crop shirt or big panties that
you just wear them out really loose and
these just hug you in like the nicest
book they're very warm and very
comfortable so so I have those open for
more pants I have these every high waist
is like jogger
kind of tracksuit pants I feel more like
I don't know how do not adopt thing how
to plan the fabric of this but they're
more like a soft kind of just loose
flowy jogger type
pant and I love them that high-waisted
they just fall nicely they like the
softest things to wear I think I'll
probably wear these on the air
plane to LA it's so good when you find
stuff that you can virtually see
yourself wearing again and again and
again and then I have these really cool
overalls which is a really cute mandolin
book shirt but these are so cool because
they've got the detailing up here with
the kind of frayed denim look which I
love the front covers up and then the
back is exposed which is also cool they
fit really nicely writing out your way
that leg of them isn't tight so it's
nice and loose and flowy almost like
having overalls with like mom jeans at
the bottom which I know my people like
yes their own little team has this
amazing like long-sleeve turtleneck
shirt and if you guys want to see my
stuff from Fashion Week I actually wore
the white version of this shirt very
easy through though so if you don't like
to have like your bra on or a commando
then that kind of thing I would say it
is like as you can see very see-through
but actually going to like that about it
you can style it really cool but what I
love about this shirt is the cute little
frills it has around the neck and also
on the arms it's like flat out and is
really adorable off the shoulder kind of
sweater top and nothing like this in my
wardrobe so I thought I would give this
a try I love how this says anything off
the shoulder feels very flattering and
really just nice off the shoulder stuff
I love to kind of layer a few necklaces
down and say looks really pretty but
just lovely and this looks cute wearing
it out or even tied up into like a
measure of type shape and it's super
warm okay and then I got this super
adorable floral dress and I think just
like I could sell this really well of
what I have on now going to like a
brunch or like a beach picnic or
something really cute and so in love
with this pink powder we're going to
plan that time like a very dark deep
pink tone and I'm not only into floral
but when I saw this I was just like I
need to give this a try and see if it'll
work
look at these colors that is so so
stunning and I love three things I have
some jackets to show you guys with
jackets cardigans jumpers whatever this
one is so incredible it is this big
shaggy fluffy cottage and one thing
about colors I'm loving this kinky ready
like dark cream
most brown shade and also this with the
cream it just looks so nice on my
skintone and I have anything like this
in my wardrobe it's so much more fun
having some color instead of oils just
having black and white self so I mean
having black is always really good
disabled but this is just so fun and it
looks cool randomly with different
patterns and different colors it just
really brings everything together it's
also super warm and fluffy and you just
wanna cuddle like a big teddy bear when
I wear it I just got this big black and
a staple trenchcoat type of thing I
don't have any big jackets that are
actually super warm I have more like
denim jackets that are super thin like I
definitely needed something for winters
and Sydney is freezing right now so this
is perfect just for on-the-go just
throwing it on and you know I mean like
everyone needs like a big black kind of
jacket and I just love this very thick
so it's super warm and the fabric on the
outside is like a felt type fabric and
the my very last piece for this whole I
was super excited about my name's like a
big vintage type of jacket and it's just
this guy it's just a really lightweight
fluffy little jacket and I love it's
kind of like it's like a very very dark
brown not a black it's like a very dark
brown you can kind of see but I love the
detailing of it looks super vintage to
me it is very warm it goes with all
sorts of different styles
