lights in a waste any time

all the damage that you've done to your
bank accounts after I give you those
promo codes and that's what I have to
say it let's just jump in to showing off
these epic clothes I'm actually gonna
start with my accessories today so I'm
starting out with these pair of
sunglasses that I am so obsessed with
this is what they look like they
actually goes so perfectly with this
outfit I honestly like cat eye is coming
it's so it's so back into style I've
seen it on so many online stores people
wearing cat eye at the moment I think
it's definitely a trend coming up all
November December time next I have this
epic as know I love boda hats I've seen
like I obviously have a collection of
these hats I don't have a white one I've
never seen a white one anywhere and this
is really cool it's like corduroy fabric
and then it just has like kind of cream
detailing and obviously the classic like
detailing up here I just saw so
comfortable I have a pretty small head
so I got a size small it fits my head
perfectly and I think these hats just
make any outfit look so cool dress it is
a little black dress and it's the same
style as this crop shirt that I have
it's in black and it's in a dress I just
love the detailing up near the boob area
a and just obsessed with everything off
the shoulder it's just the comfiest
fabric it is the coolest style and I'm
so not a dress person especially not
just like a simple little black dress
person but I just think this is like so
cool it's so comfortable and very
flattering and you can dress it up or
just wear it really casually and it's
just the most comfortable thing it just
sits so nicely then since we're talking
about that stuff the next thing I got is
this shirt it's the little crop version
of that dress and I as I was saying I'm
obsessed with this color at the moment I
just think it's really grateful coming
into summer you've got a really nice
and comfort wise I love it I don't have
to wear a bra if there's any much sells
itself I'm in love oh my gosh I am
obsessed with this I have this adorable
little set
I'm sorry another off the shoulder and
crop it just looks like this and if this
is so comfortable as well it has a
matching a skirt to it and I've been
looking for this style of skirt for so
long so if he wears them a lot I just
find them so fluttering they just nicely
take your body in I love Mick mixing and
matching this set like this with just
simple like black pants looks amazing
and then I award this skirt the other
night to an event with this show and it
just looked so cool I wore like a
leopard print bag with it you can wear
this with like a big oversized tea so
comfortable lightweight fabric and I
just love it then and this is like the
most perfect crop for summer it is just
a halter neck tie around top you don't
have to wear a bra you can let your
titties out and I'll just sit nicely in
this shirt and like I normally struggle
with v-neck stuff but I promise you this
sits really well I think it's so
fluttering and just really cute off like
imagine it was some like flowy white or
black pants with jeans or a little skirt
just this the breeze of the ocean
hitting you or you can also totally
dress this up to actually a really
versatile for either way I think so
probably tell I just love anything you
don't have to wear a bra with yeah but
that's me summarized in a shop up this
next thing we definitely do need a bra
way but actually it has some nice
titties you wanna shop this is probably
a great shirt for you
this is Villa fire I'm obsessed with
this and this nude color it is just like
a mesh shirt I think this looks so cool
with a black bra underneath or you could
even do like a colored bra I love the
dragon on the front and just it's so
grungy and cooling so sorry if you're
not into midriff little crops I have
quite a few to go through then I have
this little cosmos looking bandeau top I
love the readiness and
you telling on this with it's like a Sun
and like some stars and all that and the
back of this is really cute because you
just tie it up it's up really well
because it has a little band at the top
that's gonna hold hold it all together I
thought this little it's almost reminds
me of it just like a bikini top but it's
not fucking a top fabric I loved the
color of this I think it was really easy
and natural-looking I can just imagine
being really tanned going for like
dinner along the beach somewhere and
that's ten and these gold hoop earrings
this would look so cute also so perfect
for a festival I feel very very cool
make sure you guys some pants that I got
these pants ah
incredible like white canvas parents
like Jean fabric but very lightweight
perfect to pair with literally every
single shot I've showed you you can
either have like a resort looks kind of
on it keep the like fabric belton I
would probably switch this out for I
like just a normal black belt but it
depends on the vibe you're going for I
think um anything would look cool these
are just so comfy and so nice looking
and I love the little fraying on the
bottom of them a favor oh my gosh you
guys know I love flares and pants how
many times do I want to say this I also
love little polka dots and this is so
cute they're like little silver studs so
you'd think that there were just black
pants with white polka dots but they're
actually little silver studs and the
bottom of these pants flare out they
just are so flattering they like hug you
in the right spots and there's just a
zipper at the back and they pull in your
waist and just look super cute and I
cannot wait to wear these one of these
pants and I saw them come out and just
Comfort deluxe I'm telling you okay we
just have a few more things that's
adorable
there's no I love stop print anything
and this is this little lace ooh it's
like cream with red red stars on it and
B buttons I can't really do v-neck very
well because my titties so I just wear
I'd probably just wear like a little
black band or with it or a little bra
and like have the bra showing I
I cannot wait to wear this it just makes
me feel so good alike you know that
feeling and then we have the most
beautiful this shirt just makes me cry I
love the color of this I love this shirt
so much I think it's so beautiful I
think it's super flattering this color
just makes everyone looks so cute I feel
for summer it is the breezy astiz like a
little bralette or a bikini under it
would look so adorable it's cropped at
the front and then it goes along go at
the back under they the last little step
that I have to show you guys is this
super cute I feel like they're like
little loli Pope little lollipop pen and
shirt it's just the cutest best L set um
super summery and vibey I love that this
ties up at the back it just gives it
adds that really nice bit of detailing
you don't have to wear a bra with this
and the shirt still holds your boobs up
well enough if you've got bigger boobs
they've got you boo and I love that this
has adjustable straps you can make it
sit how you want it to really really
well and loving these colors right now
