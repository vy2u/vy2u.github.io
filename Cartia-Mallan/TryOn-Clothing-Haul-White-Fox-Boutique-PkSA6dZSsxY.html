you know
hello everyone and welcome back to my
channel super excited clothing hole
today for a white box boutique and I'm
this really a fun new backdrop
let's jump straight into this whole
video first thing that I picked up is
this super cute kind of yellow mustard
off-the-shoulder crop and Oki
firstly I'm obsessed with
off-the-shoulder stuff anything it
really complements you like decolletage
area and personally on me I find it very
slimming and just really edgy to go of
outlets I love layering lots of
necklaces with off-the-shoulder stuff
and I love the little frills that this
has on the top part and of course I am a
crop girl I pretty much only wear crop
tops unless it's like a big baggy shirt
so this is so nice super comfortable and
I'm really getting into this orangey
kind of color more bright colors let's
all start wearing more color I have this
adorable here we go again cropped kind
of sweater I love this cream color it
goes everything and is so beautiful when
I like this the most because of it I
kind of fled out and I love anything
slid and it just sits really beautifully
up on your shoulder and creates a nice
little scoop here and it's super warm
so yeah I'm loving then send on the note
of more Walmart things jumba is
literally any warmest thing of my life
as know I love rainbows stuff so that's
like yes that is so for me just as Emily
Hills and rainbows
so it's simple it's just a big white
hoodie but the difference with this is
that the insides literally feels like
the softest blanket ever it's so warm
and I just think the white is really
cool I didn't have a big white hoodie I
just have like boring black ones the
next little shirt that I have is this
really cool kaki once again a crop
long-sleeve shirt I love the fabric of
this it's just super loose and very
comfortable and easy to throw and
whenever Aki has been super in at the
moment so I thought I might try and rock
it because I just love green and dark
green tones so that's that one then I
have this really beautiful big what
kind of along that cardigan having
pieces like this is so good just to kind
of if you're on the go quickly chuck it
on over your outfit it goes with
everything keeps you super warm it
doesn't it's not too hot or too heavy
it's just nice and light I just think
it's the perfect piece to have full you
know oh my god another cocky piece that
I have is this really cool cocky kind of
denim yeah um one of my friends Lily had
one just like this but she always wears
and it just always looks so cool and it
stars it very very grungy I love this
with like a belt and a pair of dogs and
the cool kind of grungy shirt or a
long-sleeve like mesh shirt with it it
looks so cool and like with a leather
jacket or you can make a girly and cute
you know either way whatever takes your
fancy
next is a dress like this is the rarest
things we actually have two dresses in
this hole it is super rare for me to
ever wear dresses but this should caught
my eye of show you the first one both of
them off the show are like I'm so
predictable but the first one is just
this it has cute little frills sleeves
and I love this one because it has the
end that pulls in at the waist so it's
very fluttering and having little
dresses like this is always just perfect
if I have like a kind of lunch that's a
little bit fancy or even just like
Sunday picnic kind of I I just go to so
many like Sunday picnics yeah I just
thought it was cute something to throw
on or even for the beach and stuff it's
just a great little flowy dress
me really really rude this takes me
pinging up my phone trying to fill me
out the next dress that I was talking
about is this other off-the-shoulder one
and it is just your classic little black
dress and I love this because it has its
like the first shirt that I showed with
that kind of ruffling up at the top it's
stretchy and so comfortable kind of just
perfect you can dress this up you can
wear it casually great dress to have to
just throw in when you need it I am just
yet trying to get into wearing dresses
more because I just don't normally do it
cuz I feel so girly in them but then
again I went stuff like this and I'm
like I still look so going this so yeah
I love this it's just Comfort deluxe so
obsessed with this shirt it is very
simple just basic crop shirt goes with
everything I love this very structured
kind of rectangular cut that it has and
the back is really cute because you just
tie it in a little knot in for some more
yellow I have it there's really cute
play soon and feeling the yellow right
now as you can tell I just love bringing
some bright colors into my wardrobe I
mean back to LA so in it some of that
and I'm planning another like tropical
kind of holiday sunrise there too so I'm
trying to pick up stuff that I can just
throw on and lounge
and as I said trying to bring some color
back into my wardrobe so so comfy and
just like a yellow like how it makes you
happy before I forget I will show I have
this cute little two-piece set off the
shoulder shirt and it's Li the most
adorable little skirt ever it's so
comfortable this whole set and I love
the way they neither just tie it
straight to the back and have like a big
kind of bow flowing down we can loop it
around your stomach either way you can
style it up really really cool I wore
then it's unlike the first day of
splendor just like around the house and
I felt like a little sunflower be myself
or the clothes I'm now gonna show you a
whole heap of epic swimwear that I got
honestly whitefox has like the coolest
swimmer I had no idea they even stopped
swimwear and when I was looking through
the website I was like excuse me
this is amazing I'll show you that and
then I also have two pairs of shoes to
show you okay so I have a whole bunch of
bikinis here and one one piece this is
what the first one looks like I am super
into this dark grey color I don't have
anything like this and has both
detailing okay so I've got bigger boobs
it's so hard to find bikinis that like
hold you in place that is still really
cute this one is amazing because you can
adjust it really tightly at the back and
you can also pull in the front so your
boobs sitting out behind and deliciously
it's also just so comfy and it's such a
great make at the top and there's just
really simple bottoms that go is it they
just look like this and I just have a
whole bunch of strapless bikinis the
first one is this just white bed dough
top and the bottoms look like really
simple I love white supremists because
it makes you look really nice and tan
some really cool animal printed kind of
ones and that this strapless shirt is oh
my god this is my favorite thing but I
love the kind of cocky green Cola and I
was like the gold clip detailing in the
back I got two different colors in this
but this is the top and the bottoms are
also really sexy like a really slim cut
around the side there's like a little
spaghetti strap and then they kind of
like Roush I think that's what you call
it like Gavin on chop at the buff that
makes your booty look really nice
these bikinis honestly such good quality
and then I got the exact same bikini is
that in the different colors kind of
like a Moroni red tone and yeah same
bottoms got the coolest star one-piece
swimsuit so it scoop down really really
low at the back and then it makes your
butt look so good if you guys know me
which Meister you do um you know I love
stars so when I saw I felt like
yes I need this then that exact same
print I got these star bikinis and I
can't seem to find I was wearing the
bikini top it's the same bikini top as
the other ones it's like a bandeau star
top I can't find it because I was
wearing the other day and I'm like but
you guys get the point of what it would
be like but these are the bottoms for I
like how cute it's so many little star
bikinis almost there are two pairs of
shoes to show you guys I've rarely ever
buy high heels because I find them so
uncomfortable and just there's never
normally any that I really like but I
always kind of need them every once in a
while for a fence or if I have someone
where I like can't get away with wearing
my dogs so I got these really really
cute high heels and and they just cut
out at the back there and have a little
peep toe at the front and you literally
slip these on like there's sock babe
these are the comfiest high heels I've
ever worn they just hug your foot really
nicely and they're not too high or hard
to walk in and then the next perhaps
shoes that I got is this
supercool these be knee-high heel he's a
great you can adjust the tie to fit your
leg perfectly so they're not too tight
and the high heel on them give it too
high either they're really comfy and
they're kind of like a fake suede
material ok now my favorite things that
what folks sent open I was dying when I
saw these on the website exactly these
incredible big gold star earrings so big
and they just glisten you just feel like
a superstar in them add to my collection
of star earrings and then I also got
these beautiful star and crescent moon
earrings and I just you just die that's
so mean that's so beautiful nice and
lightweight and not too heavy so when
you wear them they're like dragging me
down
