right now and this is my morning routine
when I woke up I have a big stretch
check my phone and I jump out of bed and
I go make my bed because I like to be
nationally and tidy and I walk over to
the little bathroom area and I'm just
now wash my face get it all freshened up
then what I'm going to be doing is just
quickly whipping up my hair so I can get
it all out of my face so I can do my
skincare routine that I normally do in
the morning or what I've been doing here
in Bali
once I've done this I'm going in with
the origins original skin claim our
scheme is going to be putting this all
over my face I'm obsessed with this
stuff it smells so so beautiful - I'm
seriously in love with origin products
but I'm just putting this on 10 minutes
and then I'm gonna chop on my robe get
all deluxe bar style and then while I
wait I'm just gonna land around reading
this Elvis book at the moment that I'm
freaking obsessed with you guys know I
love Elvis just look how beautiful he is
like please committees have
then after 10 minutes I'm just going in
and watching this all off my face the
origins is expanding its quarter life
skincare collection with the
introduction of original skin essence
lotion I'm honestly so obsessed with
this stuff it really helps increase the
moisture on my face it smooths the
texture and it also helps to minimize
pores so I just put a little bit on my
fingertips with a cotton powder just my
fingers in the morning and at night time
and I just pad it all over my face so
the key ingredient in this is Canadian
willow-herb so it makes the skin appear
less dull boost glow and helps restore
skins clarity and luminosity so if you
guys want to pick up this product you
can find the link in my bio or Origin
stores or just calm or at a Sephora
store so once I finish my skincare and
brushing my teeth I like to go outside
and sit and just meditate for 15 minutes
this sets me up really well for the day
and I love to just have a moment to
relax and stretch then we had breakfast
brought to our villa it was so delicious
and yummy fresh fruit and rice and then
try makeup it's really hot here so I
like to keep it simple
and at once I've done all of this I was
just kind of lounging around the pool
for the day look how beautiful this
place is
honestly so I'm just writing these
little beach pants that I thrifted I'm
pretty sure that actually originally
from Victoria's Secret and a little
bikini top as well and I checked on
these cool little star earrings and
we're taking some shots so thank you
guys so much watching I hope you enjoy
it and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
