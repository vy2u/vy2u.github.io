breakfast yeah and then we're gonna head
into the city eh

even on what I like to do lately before
I actually eat like breakfast is I like
to have this hot chocolate thingy how
I'll show you guys what it is it's this
really good one that I've been loving to
have lately it's the what is it called
the unique muscles limit hot chocolate
and pretty much what you do is you just
like wait there's little sachets I'm
gonna get one of those pretty much I
just have one of these like 15 minutes
before I eat any food because it helps
to like suppress my appetite and it
keeps you fuller for longer but if I
don't feel like having a hot chocolate
normally I'll have like like one of the
coffee's and it's taste like heaven both
of them taste so good I'm in love with
them I've been doing this for a little
while now and I've been loving it so I
just fill it up with water and then I
also just like to add like a little bit
of soy milk into it
oh my god yeah this if you want it to be
sweeter you can add stevia which is what
I like to do oh my god I can't deal with
this frizzy hair nah I gotta do
something about it it's actually
discussing in a head infinity once I
