stuff beauty I'm getting some hair
extensions to put back in
because I want to have long hair forever
the four days and then I'll take them
out again
apparently lunch the back P cause you
all wanted more videos with my friends
so you asked I provide my darling again
say something speech my subscriber and
trying to try part of my body introduce
yourself introduce yourself I'm Polly
tell the guy yourself mom of your
interests I love my family
do you think I'm awesome
I'm not gonna drive honey have an
excellent it's Friday and today we just
I couldn't really felt like my whole day
because we had school but I'm filming
now so we just finished school and yeah
as I said I'm gonna go go to the salon
and I'll get my hair put in and then
after that we're going to go to the
grocery store to get some ingredients as
Lila and I cook international we're
making it like the main course will be
sticky coconut chicken with with it you
know that I'd Chile quite low and sticky
like coconut rice because it's like
we're doing like Thai food tonight
speech you want to get to the sub or
working that red Lizzy
say hi to my friends hi friends so much
to do I like
definitely
okay so we are at Hot Stuff beauty so I
was getting the little micro tape hair
extensions put in and they just look
like this they're really awesome because
in previous times I've had like normal
micro tape and they're really big kind
of strips and they just like make your
hair really hot - a lot but I got use it
on micro tech - the first time and they
were awesome
and this is what the hair looks like
once we had put them all in so nice and
long and the hair is like literally
ridiculously thick and we just curled up
the hair and I brushed it over to one
side getting myself all ready for the
interview that I did with Karissa who is
the owner of hot stuff beauty she just
asked me some questions about my youtube
and how i got started and my little
makeup business sort of thing and all
other sorts of questions regarding that
stuff I thought I'd include some of the
footage just because a lot of the
questions that she asked is really
similar to a lot of the questions you
guys asked in the comments about
starting a YouTube channel and whatnot
so I'll also leave the link to the full
interview I did with her down below so
it'll link you to Chris's channel I'm
here with Katya Milan today um and she's
a YouTube vlogger / makeup artist /
young female entrepreneur he's doing
some really great things and has so much
potential ahead of her she's 16 still in
school and she's already got over 41,000
YouTube subscribers which is just insane
that's really make me sound so great you
know you put yourself out there so much
with the videos and stuff so many people
want to do that but they're so scared
and putting themselves in front of
everyone how do you deal with that and
that's your advice to people that might
want to do the same I think that that is
a really hard thing is just getting past
that thing of having people like people
watching you that you know obviously
everyone's going to have their own
feedback and their own thoughts about it
you know whether it's positive or
negative but I think that at the start
especially for my youtube I was just
getting like a lot of negative comments
but it wasn't comment straight to me it
was just this talk around you know
what's cardi doing what's this YouTube I
think at first it was a bit off-putting
having people like oh my gosh they're
talking about me everyone's judging me
for this but you know I've got really
great friends really great support and
family so I just focused on that and
thinking you know I've got all these
people in the subscribers youtube I
think just say obviously like yeah I
think you know keeping in mind that who
cares what everyone else thinks if
you've got like your plan set in your
mind for like what you want to achieve
with it or your goals most of the people
that you're associated with now you're
not going to be associated within a few
years time or anything and if you still
are then just you know separate yourself
from that because you don't need people
are being negative or anything so but
yet to answer the question I just think
it's just staying you know true to
yourself and thinking about the
positives more than focusing on a few of
the negatives I think again don't let it
discourage you because if I hadn't let
it put me off at the start it would not
have been you know where it is now I
just have a lot of fun with yeah it's
really really inspiring thank you very
much thanks for having me and my get
hair extensions everyone yes you just
dumped them in my salon sorry I told you
so much I love it
