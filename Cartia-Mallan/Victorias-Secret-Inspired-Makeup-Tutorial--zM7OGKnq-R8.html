showing you how I got this beautiful
Victoria Secret inspired makeup look now
I was looking it through a lot of photos
of all the gorgeous models and seeing
the sort of makeup that they do for
their our big fashion shows and this was
pretty much the most common one it's
very very jewy it's very glowy it's so
feminine and in a way it's really sexy
it is a very very simple makeup look
anyone can achieve this look I love the
message it's Victoria's Secret kind of
has this thing of you know be proud of
your feminine side being sexy is great
and yeah I just love it I love Victoria
Secret so much I have so many of their
little sprays and all their togs and
bras and Underpants I'm in love with
them and the models are just absolutely
beautiful and yet if you do every other
time go and watch some interviews of
like Candice Swanepoel and Miranda and
stuff they do have some good you know
stuff to say about being a woman and
just you know being okay with your
feminine side and just like know openly
being able to be like you know what I'm
a girl and I'm hot and I can be sexy and
that's fine kind of thing I hope you all
enjoyed this makeup look I had so much
fun making this video um I think it's
really great to find your inner sexy
flair somewhere and then don't be afraid
to show it it's really nothing to be
ashamed of so to start out I'm taking my
Lumi primer and this is a really
gorgeous probably because it gives you a
nice gooey sort of finish
so I'm just taking my L'Oreal Lumi
Foundation and my in aqsa bronzing BB
cream on this it cosmetics our
foundation brush so I'm pressing one
pump and a tiny little bit of the BB
cream on to the brush and then I'll just
be lightly buffing this into the skin
and this combination is really gorgeous
because it gives so really nice
juhi effect once all that is done I am
taking my mac prolongwear concealer on
the other end of that foundation brush
and I'm just highlighting underneath my
eyes because in the photos that I looked
at they had quite nice natural-looking
highlights so gone ahead and added the
highlighter onto the bridge of my nose
the top of my forehead and my chin then
so it's not too much of a dramatic
highlight I like to take that original
side of the foundation brush that we
used and blend out these products once
I'm done I like to take my Mac Studio
Fix powder to set all of the foundation
in place now I like to move on to doing
my eyebrows so I just brush through them
with this spoolie and then I like to use
my Smashbox - a brow set to fill them in
once I finished my eyebrows I like to
move on to my bronzer and this is so sad
it's almost empty it's like my favorite
bronzer but this is the NARS bronzer and
the color casino so I'm just taking
quite a lot of the bronzer on my contour
Sigma brush and really define my
cheekbones and also put a little bit of
bronzer up on the top of my forehead
okay so that's the first step done now
to just give an overall bronzy look I
like to take the Kardashian bronzer and
my Real Techniques blush brush just to
further blend out this bronzing lot line
and just to give a really nice overall
from the below then taking my NARS blush
in the color orgasm I will be applying
this to my cheeks so since the
Victoria's Secret Angels always have
really really flushed rosy cheeks I'm
putting quite a bit on and I will be
blending it from the apples of my cheeks
and up further to just above where we
put that bronzing line yay now for my
favorite part and pretty much the
statement piece of this whole look I'm
taking my favorite highlighter oh my
gosh I was laughing all the faces I was
pulling um and this is the Mac soft and
gentle and we want to stack on a lot of
this this is the main part of the makeup
which sort of makes it the Victoria
Secret look you really want to pump up
the highlighter to give a really nice
juhi is low but I'm applying this to
sort of like the side of my face and
just above that blush there on the
bridge of my nose and the tip of my nose
I'm also just going to put a tiny dust
over my forehead and a little bit on my
chin and my Cupid's bow then taking my
Paint Pot in soft ochre I will be
applying this all over my lid as a base
for all the eyeshadow to go onto then
take him as little Stila palette and
this sort of pinky champagne shimmer
color I'll be patting this all over my
lid and also don't forget to really
stack it on in the inner corner because
there's one major sort of look that the
Victoria Secret Angels go for and with
more of a slightly deeper champagne II
tone I'm going to be taking that same
brush and blending this shimmer shadow
into my crease then taking a little eye
shadow blending brush I will be blending
these two out and then also adding a
tiny bit of this gold color onto my lid
and this is from The Naked 2 palette
I'll put all the names of the products
linked below then with this little
angled eyeliner brush I'm taking this
brown color and applying it right
underneath my lash line now since the
models never really seem to have like
any heavy liquid eyeliner I'm just
taking a little bit of that brunt as
well and putting it on my upper lash
line
then taking a matte white eyeshadow I'll
be applying this to my brow bone to open
up my eyes a bit more I'll be taking my
white eyeliner and applying this to my
waterline and then with my Jordana best
lash volumizing mascara longest time
I'll be applying this to my upper and
lower lashes now finally time for the
lips the Angels always seem to stick to
a really nice girly pink lip palette
i'ma play miss Chi Chi lipstick which is
just like a rose pink one and over the
top I'm applying one of the Revlon
butter glosses just to really gloss it
up
