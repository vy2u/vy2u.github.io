last weekend we went to Vegas and now
we're actually on the road again
to San Diego we're going to cross
festival because some of our friends are
playing leader and the Roofus boys are
playing
the boys play yesterday which sucks
because we are going I wanted to see
them play live I wanted to go as well
and I've actually like got a few
opportunities where I've been meaning to
go see them oh my gosh it's really cute
Cafe Gratitude
really stupid and funny story to tell
you guys we completely just my whole
lives but we are excited about it
instead of pop he's gone
no hotel okay we finally just checked
into a motel it's not the one that I
booked accidentally booked one that's so
far out of town by accident there's like
two at the same name and then anyways I
de not had a ticket for me and then they
accidentally gave it away to someone
else because they thought it was a
coming time ticketless see how he has a
ticket we've just checked into this
other random little motel that is so
stinking hot I've never looked so glowed
down in my life this is literally a
month of partying summed up in one gross
human and and I'll figure out what the
hell sweat would just post mate some
alcohol here because we went to go buy
some they didn't have any internet every
issue Under the Sun has literally just
arisen a rose I don't know what the hell
to wear I'm just gonna keep trying stuff
and I'll keep you guys posted

care of her Wendy

festival in Las Vegas
oh I'm gonna do that
hey guys okay so I don't know how many
days it's been since I've filmed I kind
of I stopped filming after I got home
from Vegas obviously you guys would have
probably seen the really upsetting event
that happened in Vegas um that was a
really bad shooting there and I'm very
lucky that I wasn't there on the weekend
then that happened but I just want to
quickly say how upset that made me to
see there that one man felt like he had
the right to go ahead and do that I
think that you know this is a huge
wake-up call for America to sort out
that gun law this up because it just
it's not it's not acceptable it's not
okay just wild and my heart goes out to
the families and all the people that
were affected by that shooting I'm I
can't even begin to imagine the pain and
the grief and just everything that comes
after such an event but I'm sending all
my love and energy and whatever I can
possibly do to help
but anyways sorry too
I just thought I really definitely had
to mention something about that
so all of these guys were messaging me
saying if I was okay because I always
say posted the videos over most of you
thought I was still in Vegas but anyways
