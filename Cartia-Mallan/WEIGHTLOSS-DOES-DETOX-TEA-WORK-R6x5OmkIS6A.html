are doing well so in this video today i
am doing something that i wouldn't
usually do which is reviewing a detox
weight-loss - I guess they not my call
them I was approached by a company
called your tea and they asked if I
wanted to try out their tea which is
this it's called
tiny tea and at first I was a little bit
hesitant because I have tried a weight
loss detox treat in the past I won't
name names and brands sham and because I
don't want to cause conflict but um the
tea that I previously had made my
insides feel ill it was pretty much just
like taking a laxative and I was just
not it was not healthy and I did not
took good when I was drinking that tea
so yes I was very hesitant and I am
really quite picky about what I put in
my body I'm really wary of ingredients
in products such as this and so is my
mom's you like chicks everything makes
sure it's all good so to start out I
want to be upfront and clear about this
yes this is a sponsored video I was sent
this tea to review but in saying that
all opinions are my own and you'll see
that throughout the video as I talk
about it a bit more and secondly I'm
very picky about the companies that I
collaborate with you guys would know
this I only will ever promote or talk
about products that I wholly and truly
believe in so now that that's any pretty
a part of information is done I just
want to be upfront with you guys and I
know that that's all the details let's
get straight into talking about this
product it was actually kind of perfect
timing but you're teasing me Nemo being
like hey don't like try this product out
because at that time I was beginning to
really swamped with a lot of work and I
had a lot of stuff happening and I did
not have time to be getting to the gym I
felt my body levels were just so out of
whack I wasn't eating healthy I was just
my insides literally felt clogged up and
it was just
not a nice feeling at all this happens
to lots of us when you're really
stressed with work or school and or
you're partying a lot so you're putting
lots of alcohol and bad toxins into your
body sometimes need to take a step back
and be like okay let's reassess what's
happening here why do I feel buggy why
do I feel kind of sick and usually it's
just a build up of fatty toxins and fast
food that we eat and not looking after
ourselves and up this came at this time
when I was just kind of like as always I
need a frickin detox ASA I've been
drinking it for about three weeks now
and I can happily happily say I have
some good information to tell you guys
about it and some I guess guidelines
what you should do if you're interested
in doing a detox to you like this how
much when they first emailed me I went
on to the website and I just wanted to
check out what they're about what was
actually in the teas and just kind of
just to find some information to see if
I wanted to do this first off the thing
that I noticed on the website is that it
had so much great information about what
to do alongside the tea so I was really
just emphasizing the one factor that I
think a lot of people don't realize is
that it's not magic it's not gonna
you're not gonna be able to drink it
like three times and be like oh five
kilos off my body know when you do a
detox it's kind of like you're aligning
your lifestyle it's a lifestyle change
so be ready to eat healthy and do a bit
of exercise and make sure everything's
balanced so then the tea can do its job
and aid all of that what I know they're
supposed hoppers a website was really
upfront about this and it had a really
great eating plan there was some
exercise information and healthy tips
lots of reviews it wasn't just promoting
like get skinny and all this stuff like
some of the other ones do it was really
just promoting a healthy lifestyle
outlook love what the company is about
they promote sort of what I like to
promote so my story with the tea when I
started taking it um when I first tried
it I was expecting to have that
disgusting case like the previous care
that I had but I was so surprised
it literally just tastes like green tea
YUM I ended up just looking forward to
each time I got to drink the tea which
the instructions which it says is that
you're supposed to drink out half an
hour before or after a meal and you do
that three times a day so but I know I
like to do is I drink it before it and
in the morning which would give me a
really great energy boost and then I
would have it after lunch and then I
would have it after dinner or before
that and whatever like whenever it suits
you you kind of work it into a lifestyle
so the main things I began to notice in
the first week of drinking the steam was
my energy it was just like boom boom
boom when I was energetic I fell already
kind of like my body was clearing up
like I wasn't feeling as glug ish and
gross as I was the week before but I
also really notice and what I did read
on about the product is that it can
actually help with clearing your skin so
not only was I noticing and improvement
in my energy of my skin started looking
all clear and a little bit more radiant
which was amazing because my skin had
literally broken out from all the crappy
food I was eating the week before what
it also does is it speeds up your
metabolism and so what I would notice is
that I wasn't getting at those like
snack cravings and I would always feel
like during the day it just like it
wasn't there I don't know how to really
describe it so you can try it but it's
just like you don't think about it as
much it's like your stomach feels
cleansed and clean and full already like
it doesn't need the excess like study
things in your stomach I guess if that
makes any sense and so not I don't know
like all the actual proper terms for all
of this stuff that I'm explaining I'm
just kind of explaining what I felt so
hopefully it makes sense since its
cleaning out your digestive system it's
getting rid of those bad toxins so then
when you do eat food and stuff fatty
acids aren't clean on kill stomach
anymore they can easily flush out and
that's what the tea like helps with kind
of how it comes into the weight loss
realm now as I said in the beginning
this is not going to magically help you
lose 10 bajillion kilos it's going to
aid you
your weight-loss journey that's what
you're about or your journey to try and
get a little bit more tired feeling
bloated it also helps to floating but
pretty much a lot of you guys know I've
been on a like a little weight loss
journey for quite a few years now I've
also lost some weight across about two
years and I'm not trying to make this
video a full video dedicated on my
weight loss journey
I'll just lightly touch on some things
I've literally tried every single weight
loss remedy or anything there is in the
books to year so I just began to realize
it's literally what everyone says you
just have to eat healthy drink water get
enough sleep and move your body the best
tips and tricks for weight loss if
you're if you're intending to do this
detox as a detox and weight loss kind of
aiding and program is do the teas three
times a day when it says 30 minutes
before after a meal I would recommend
three or four times a week going on a
thirty minute
brisk walk it doesn't have to be like a
crazy run or anything this is what I did
when I was losing weight I would
literally exercise three times a week a
fast walk just to get body moving so
it's burning some extra fat and
cleansing everything will only hell it's
only gonna add the tea it's not gonna
like do anything bad to it and along
with that the most important I cannot
stress it is the most important thing is
the eating why you should be aiming for
is just simple stuff eat what you
normally eat but cut out the snacking
and cut out any dessert or any excess
sugar that isn't needed
healthy breakfast like yoga and some
fruit have a mid-morning snack like some
almonds and sultanas or something or
measly bars always good lots of water
throughout the first part of the day and
then lunchtime like whatever you want a
sandwich or a salad or pasta anything
you can eat whatever you want it's just
all about moderation and then try not
snack in between the afternoon that is
where I always struggled it was like I
would get home from school or I get home
from doing
and I'd be like oh my god I'm so hungry
oh I need food instead habit II have
green tea have water anything try and
switch it out and soon enough you'll
realize your body doesn't crave it
anymore it's probably just craving it
because it's used to I'll come home and
I'll have a snack kind of thing so once
I was able to cut out that afternoon
snack period I was fine and then so if
you did not have normal dinner whatever
look like it's as I said eat whatever
you want just in moderation at the end
of the day you should kind of like have
had enough food feeling your system and
good whole food feeling and system
making sure you're getting enough sleep
is so important the later up you stay
the more tired your body is getting is
getting more drained and it will be
craving that sweet food even more so
that is pretty much my main tips on
trying to lose some weight while taking
this tea it's really not even trying to
lose weight if you just patch tweaks and
little things in your in your kind of
lifestyle plan that you have going at
the moment it can honestly benefit you
so much so in regards to my weight loss
with this I've lost about 1 to 2 kilos
over the few weeks just kind of
fluctuates like depends on how my week
is or how much work I have or how many
times I drunk the tea I haven't been
exercising it all throughout this
because I've literally been that busy
but my goal was not to lose anyway it
was more or less just to clean up my
system so I haven't really lost any
groundbreaking amount of weight because
I haven't tried or put in as much effort
as I probably should have but um in
regards to a detox
I feel fully cleanse like full 360 in my
body it is all clean now and it feels
great so I think that you can get I have
the 28-day detox and it just comes in a
box like this I think the packaging is
really cute I need to store all of the
tea inside yeah I don't know what else
to say I guess I know a lot of people
don't like watching these videos because
they think they're fully sponsored or
they're really just like the company
putting words in
some people's mouth but they emphasize
to me that they want this to be my
review about how my journey was with the
tea they gave me enough time to complete
the the weeks of how long I wanted to
try it out for and stuff so um all
opinions are my honest truth and I would
highly recommend this for anyone that
wants a detox or that once a little bit
of an aid with their weight loss if
they're already doing the healthy eating
and the exercising and it's important to
look after your body and feel good about
your body and your everything so you get
into a good headspace so I think this is
a really great way to do that overall
what I love this tea thank you all so
much for watching this video I hope you

day and if you guys liked this review or
