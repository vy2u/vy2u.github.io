okay so I am currently at Michelle's
place it's getting quite late on a what
day is it today a six of December so
it's a boxing day here in Australia and
um their Christmas yesterday is lovely
and you guys would have seen my vlog and
I uploaded and tomorrow I'm flying into
Melbourne to go to be on the valley
festival and I was thinking you know
what I want another video for this week
and I want to upload a video on New
Year's Eve to kind of recap this year
2016 it's been a very crazy yet I asked
you guys on Twitter to just ask me some
questions about overview local
highlights etc so I'm going to be
answering your questions so this is
really important to do because this year
has been hands-down like the craziest
year of my life I've learnt a lot this
year and as Kylie Jenner said I've
realized a lot of things as well
so yeah and if you're wondering we've
got a tropical theme going into this
video um I just got her shell that she
gave me a friendship any in celebration
today we just booked a trip to Hawaii
and to LA so we're both very very
excited we're going with Dan immensely
as well and some other friends so this
is that's literally like hands down
possibly like I'm ending this year on an
extreme highlight by doing that because
Hawaii's been like a dream destination
for me for ages I'm leaving this in for
the video because I'm so excited so yeah
I just written down all your questions
in my journal and I'm going to start
answering them biggest lesson you have
learned this year so I've listed for the
main things I've learned there's
definitely a lot more than this but um
these are probably the key things I've
learned the first one is patience I am a
very impatient person when I want
something I want it I want it instantly
and sometimes I put too much pressure on
either myself or sometimes on other
people to make things happen when
sometimes things just take time patience
with people and patience with myself
most importantly um I can't stress how
much pressure I used to put on myself
just because I'm a very driven person so
being able to learn patience
was amazing for me and I'm still
obviously like practicing all of these
things only don't judge and make
assumptions um so this you have
definitely learned don't judge a book by
it's cover
don't jump to assumptions about people
or a situation especially situations
don't just because you hear one thing or
you might see one thing until you really
know the full truth don't make
assumptions and don't judge a situation
because you never really know what a
person is going through um or other
people are going through until you've
lived it or until you're yeah until you
know the whole story as I said thirdly
live in the now you guys know that I
have my now tattooed on my wrist I got
that this year I also kind of learned
about the concepts around living in the
current moment and not creating anxiety
about a future moment and not feeling
depressed about past moments such as
being here and being happy in this
moment and just understanding that we
cause a lot of mental confliction when
we start to overthink the future and
have definitely helped me stop
overthinking cleared my brain a lot and
it's also a really great method to just
go back to if you ever start something
anxious and the fourth and most
important one is acceptance as all the
other words acceptance for people and
acceptance in situations and it also
acceptance myself one thing I always
struggled with was if there was
something wrong with me whether I was
sick whether I felt mentally unclear
whether I was just going through a rough
time I always found it so hard to accept
that within myself that that was my
reality at the time because as I said I
put a lot of pressure on myself to
always be like 10 out of 10 like
energized and happy and creative and
everything this year has been the
hardest for me in regards to that
because I've definitely learned the
other side of the spectrum and I just
learnt to accept myself in every single
situation that I'm in and also to accept
others in any situation that they're in
and be kind and kind to myself and kind
to others so yeah there are the four
things I have learnt this year
favorite place you visited this here you
guys probably know this is an obvious
one New York was a hands-down my
favorite place I visited this year what
was your least favorite news of 2016 um
my least favorite news was definitely
that Donald
got elected as president this was a huge
shock to me I mean stuff like this
happens and I truly believe that things
happen for a really weird reason but it
was definitely very disheartening to
learn the statistics of the voting and
all that I don't want to bring it back
up we've all kind of everyone went
through their moment with realizing that
and like accepting that news but for me
that was really just hunting for someone
that really cares about creating social
change it felt like everything took a
few steps back so it definitely was like
a like it like we're trying to
create change but that happened so it
was it was hard um news to hear but I
think it's very motivating cuz it's like
okay we're gonna overcome this and I
think it's definitely brought people
together more has allowed people to be
more educated on things going on around
the world what would you change about
2016 um I'm a firm believer in the idea
as I just said that everything happens
for a reason I would not change one
thing about this year as hard as some
parts of it have been for me um I would
never like literally never want to
change that I'm so grateful for every
single moment good and bad that has
happened to me I would not have learned
as much as I have learned if I didn't go
through those really hard moments of
this year and I'm so happy they happen
to me at a young age they and now
because I can take on all of the things
that I've learned and really apply them
to my life and help myself grow fir that
as a person um so I'm grateful for all
the downfalls of this year and I
wouldn't change anything about it at all
the people I've met are incredible the
experiences I've had incredible and um
yeah I think it's bad to live with
regrets now I don't think you should
ever regret anything you do you always
go into doing something for a reason and
you're always going to learn something
from that you just have to realize that
once you can realize that you live a
very happy life because you're like okay
even if something bad happen why don't
you can question instead like oh
like why that happened to me in a
negative way you can you can question it
in a and analytical kind of like
thinking why like why did that happen
and what do I need to learn from that so
that's that's something really
I've learned from this year as well best
things you've learned about yourself
this year um this is so cool I've
learned so much about myself this year I
learnt a lot more about my creativity
and who I am as a person really like Who
cardia really isn't obviously cardia is
going to continue to change and grow and
I found a love for writing definitely
found a love for getting behind a camera
and filmmaking in the creative process
behind creating content and creating art
learnt that I'm a lot stronger than I
thought I was and I can pull myself out
of situations of the ability to love
myself so much that I can heal myself so
I was amazing to learn because that was
a huge goal of mine self-love is always
a huge goal that I'm endlessly working
on so to know that I had the ability to
get myself out of really tough
situations this year was incredible um
and I also learnt that I feel things
incredibly deeply than a super empath so
if when I meet people I feel a lot from
them I feel their energy if someone's
telling me a story about something or a
hard time like I literally tune into
people and I'm not sure if you're
spiritual or I'm not sure what you
believe in but this is what happens to
me if you look up empath or people that
are empathic um it explains
I've known this since I was really young
but when I connect more with the world
with people it gets a lot stronger for
me so I've definitely learned that yeah
I feel really deeply I love very deeply
and yeah I'm just a lot more sensitive
than I think I ever thought
um I think the older I get the most
symptom I get but I think it's a nice
quality to have because I can definitely
see things from every point of view so
that's really cool proudest moments of
this year I think my proudest moment
reflecting back is that I've lived out
of home for a year now which is so weird
it's gone past so quickly second thing
I'm most proud of is um taking time and
putting in efforts to work on myself and
expand my mind so yeah working on self
love working on self development
familiarizing myself with things that
are beyond myself what else is happening
in the world you know other humans and
how everything kind of takes and how it
all works best compliment of the year
it's my new favorite compliment to give
people and it's my favorite complement
of
time to receive because I think it goes
beneath like outer surface it goes in
within you and it's it's like when
people say this it's really like driven
from such a beautiful place I feel
because that you have to feel this
completely to be able to tell some of
this and that is you have the best
energy I think that is the most
incredible thing to say to someone if
you if you really genuinely mean and if
you genuinely feel something from them
because I feel like that really means
that even pacted them in some way that's
made them like feel good you know if
someone has a good energy they're doing
something that's impacting you in a way
that you're like ah I feel great around
you like I want to be around you more
and I just think it's such a beautiful
thing too um yes and people I just
repeated myself like five times there
but that is my favorite compliment what
books helped you grow this year it's an
easy one the power of now I was speaking
about it endlessly um but that book
literally helped me through so much this
year um and I think it's worthwhile
reading a best decision of the UM
my best decision of the year was to keep
pushing myself um even when I've been in
a really dark place and I'm referring to
like when I think one of the hardest
moments of my year was when everything
that I had in my mind that I kind of had
like pre-planned or what I expected my
reality to be when that all didn't
happen when I went to LA I was talking
about this a little bit how la was very
challenging for me it was a very hard
time for me mentally because I was just
going through so much I was experiencing
anxiety for the first time I had
paranoia when I was trying to sleep like
all these things just came on to me like
all of a sudden like I never experienced
any of them so then I went to LA and I
was thinking I was going to have an easy
peasy grand time and I would be happy
all the time but it was very very
challenging and it's just the way that I
had to be I had to the universe
obviously pushed me into that um space
to really teach me about the industry
I'm in what do I really care about who
do I really care about what sort of
people who I want to be around and I
think in LA that was really hard to be
away from home for so
in a way and just in a complete zone of
discomfort for a really long time um and
when I got home it wasn't like the
minute I was home that everything was
all like better again like dealing with
anxiety and dealing with mental fog I
call it is something that you have to
like but you have to like find it in you
to really like heal that cannot saying
it is always like that on every level
everyone's on a different level but I
knew with her myself that I could help
myself and so I really like was
determined to do that I always talked
about the idea of like I live my life
every day and I want to be happy every
day I wake up I want to feel energized I
want to be in a good headspace I want to
be positive and so when that wasn't my
reality anymore I just was so like every
day that I wake up and I still felt like
 I was just really like oh this is
another day of this like when I used to
refer to I used to say literally when is
Katya gonna come back because this isn't
caught it and feel like myself for like
a few months I was like I've lost myself
completely which was interesting because
I've never ever felt like I didn't know
who I was or I didn't know that I was in
Cocke to control myself
I felt so out of control and yet the the
best decision for me was pushing through
that and every day just practicing
little things that were going to help me
get out of that space and how could I
hit like pushing to heal myself instead
of just completely collapsing and I
could have sunk into that and created
that as my own reality and just like fun
I'm like this forever but I had it in me
I knew there's a little flame in me and
I just had to keep up putting the
freaking paper on it to ignite it like
it is how I'd refer to it so a message I
can just say from that is that even when
you're going through a really hard time
everyone goes through crazy horrible
times in their life and it's going to be
different for everyone but all I can say
is that you have to just remain positive
even when it feels freaking impossible
to write out how you feel and always
always look for the lessons that you're
learning and I think that's what really
got me through and um yeah it's just
it's like crazy when I when I like look
back on how crap I felt earlier in the
year and how I feel now and I'm
like proud to say that obviously with
the help of supportive friends and
people that I love and everything but at
the end of the day like I did this for
me like I got myself out of that and I
was I became my own best friend and my
own supporter I'm my own you know like
that's that's how I really got out of it
so it's the best like yeah I can't even
I can't even no but that's yeah
definitely keep pushing keep pushing you
have it and you're so much stronger than
what you think what's one of my main he
knew you would truly loved this year
there's been so many moments where I've
just stood back and been like wow like I
can't even believe the people I have in
my life and he's like like-minded humans
and like creatives and just people that
is giving me so much love firstly you
guys endlessly like it blows my mind the
messages I receive and the connection
that you guys are like creating with me
energy you're almost sending my way
you're like endlessly supportive of any
endeavor I had going so that throughout
the entire year I think also I felt most
loved when I was going through my
hardest part of this year seeing the
people that supported me and helped me
through and would talk to me and talk
like help me talk out my how I was
feeling because I struggle with being
able to completely open up to people
unless I'm like really really close with
them and even then I still find it hard
to talk about some things and be
completely open and um and vulnerable
with people so having friends around
that persisted with me and broke down
every wall until I would like just
unleash it I I just yeah there's a few
people in my net in my life is here that
have really done that for me and like I
get all choked up I'm like it but I'm so
grateful for that but another moment I
felt truly loved or was the moment I
realized that I could be completely
loved and that comes to like
relationships I've had this year um and
even though I I never properly like
dated someone I definitely I've seen a
few wins this year you know um but
there's been there was one that I met
and I had the most insane connection
with him and it was a very short-lived
one but that was location-wise it will
kind of up but I have met this
guy and I think we just like
hit it off like I I got along with him
so on I was almost like we just
understood each other I never had that
with any guys I used to get into just
silly silly flings with silly guys I
didn't even like that much that weren't
good for me that weren't right for me
and when I met him I was like wow like
I'm not even upset that I can't be with
you but I feel like this thing in me
that is now like you deserve love like
you can be loved you know how I feel
like what's the change girls go through
the thing where they're like I'm
impossible to love like no one's ever
gonna love me like and I had that
realization this year that this person
or there was like there's like two
people that they were like just it's
this is different connection and to sort
of feel such love from someone in such a
connection with someone um was
incredible and just such an amazing
thing to learn and experience I know
what I deserve now I don't know what
feels right what it should feel like
whether you really connect with someone
so that was the first time in my whole
life that really felt true connection
um in a relationship with a boy not just
something stupid not something that was
just sexual that's something that's here
you know obviously and there's support
and love from my mom at so many times in
this year like so so much I just like
blows my mind that one human can love
something so much and also I think that
I've connected a lot with the universe a
lot more with spirits with angels like I
don't know as I said I OSS I don't know
what you guys believe in but I've had
some really important experiences this
year with ghosts with angels with past
life stuff with synchronicities and I
just think that it's really cool when
you kind of switch on your consciousness
a bit more what you can really see a lot
of truths come out and you also can feel
really like supported and connected and
guided by these these spirits and
whatnot so yeah thank you for you guys
supporting me throughout this year I'm
so excited for next year there is just
so much fun stuff coming up and I'm
really excited to take everything that
I've learned from this year push it into
next year and just be better and keep
learning and I can't only send you guys
so much love and so much positivity
that's the one thing when I end this on
is always look
to be positive always look for the light
in every situation and you've got this
as I said you're a lot stronger you
probably think and I also found that in
myself this year so yeah I love you guys
so so much I'll see you all in this is
so weird to say it literally I'll see
you all next year in 2017 and if you
