well I mean laughs boy I just know what
I mean laughs boy I just know I'm in
love good good okay so this morning I
just started out by drinking a whole
heap of water I like to do this it just
makes me feel like awake and I don't
drink enough water in a day so drinking
in the morning always gets me like ready
and like at least kind of hydrated so
once I've gotten out of bed I just kind
of went to the kitchen boiled the kettle
and while I was waiting I was really
hungry so I started snacking on some
dates and I'm actually obsessed with
dates are so delicious and what I also
like to do is I put some almond spread
on top of them so you just cut the dates
in half and then take the seed out and
then put the almonds right on top I know
this looks so gross but trust me it
tastes so so good so after I've had my
little snack I decide to make a smoothie
and I've been loving doing this because
last week I popped into bed blends and
picked up all of this new like protein
powders and smoothie powders and this is
the bare greens powder so I use it as a
base for this green smoothie adds so
much flavor and it's so freakin yummy so
I just poured 250 millilitres of water
into my little smoothie blender and then
I put 2 teaspoons of the bad greens in
to the cup then I just like to add a
handful of kale and also a handful of
spinach and then what I also like to do
is put in one full banana you can
literally do any combo of any fruits or
whatever in this is just what I like to
do and then I'm adding some manuka honey
but you can use any type of honey that
you like normal honey does the job and
this is everything then to make it nice
and icy and refreshing I just like to
add some cubes of ice and then I pop the
lid on and then I'm ready to blend it up
so for lunch on this particular day I
decided to start by poaching some eggs
because I'm obsessed with doing this at
the moment I've got this really cool
little pan that poach them for you it's
so much easier so what I do is just
spray some oil onto two of little egg
holder things for the eggs don't stick
and then I'd like to crack the eggs into
the pan and today I decided to add a
little bit more flavour to the egg so I
put some rockin seasoning on top of them
you can do whatever I leave them normal
I prefer them normal but this is just
what I did today along with the eggs I
thought I'd just make a little salad so
I'm just cutting up some avocado and I'm
going to use it to kind of make like a
guac spread sort of thing for the salads
what I'm just doing is getting 1/2 of
avocado out and I'm putting it into a
bowl and mushing this all up and then
what I like to do is add a big squeeze
of lemon in there just for some added
flavor I'm just putting a handful of
kale as the base of the salad and then
I'm taking some stir-fried veggies from
last night and I'm just putting these in
the microwave and reheating them and
then I'll be stacking this on top of the
kale and then putting the eggs and the
other and you'll see it all come
together
I just know love more I just know so
finally it's Coffee time I'm just taking
some soy milk because I don't like to
drink normal dairy milk and I'm just
using my Nespresso coffee machine and
putting a little pot in and then
pressing the button getting the coffee
out I love this machine it's honestly
the best thing ever and then for a
little snack I'm just cutting up some
strawberries and also cutting up a full
banana and then I what I like to do is
just add some of that almond spread that
you guys saw before and also some honey
and it is honestly the yummiest snack
ever so finally for dinner my darling
mum made me some tuna pasta it's super
simple it's literally just past us and
tomatoes and beans tunas and garlic it's
really light and it's yummy and I just
used gluten-free pasta if you want
something a little bit lighter that
doesn't make your stomach feel so heavy
I definitely recommend this this is what
I do and I love it so thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed and
I'll see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
