Fox you guys may know her my beautiful
model on the gram well she also makes
YouTube videos and what do we meet we
met a few months ago I'm pretty sure
yeah Miron
we just met randomly Aiko say hello you
seem nice cut it out yeah we just got
chatting and we like realized we're
loading yeah coming lots of different
life Elysium and commerce is always cool
to meet people I guess in this industry
but yeah it kind of switched although
recently Rachelle's been getting into
meditation teaching and learning about
meditation more and she's obviously been
practicing it for a while and I wanted
to learn more about it and then she came
to my house and taught me in my house
mates about meditation and from there
I've started meditating and look at us
now we're gonna have a bad meditation ya
know it seemed really really good you
mean like really receptive and enjoy it
it's interesting and like I definitely
feel I think with like a lot of people
I'd get a lot of messages to us that
people have heard about meditation
before or they you know they everyone
knows of what meditation is but not
necessarily like how to do it what it
can help with benefits of skip it gets
really confusing I feel like some people
think that meditation is you just like
think meditation you think elephant monk
yoga like you just have all these
preconceived ideas of meditation and
it's just a mental trick is just like
it's brilliant brain hack that brings so
much surrender knees I was saying to the
first time I came and toured I was like
okay so everything in your life told you
to go go go go go nothing ever tells you
to stop nothing ever tells you like hey
just sit down for five minutes without
your phone and do nothing
that's just like another thing
especially in our generation I just feel
like people are just not encouraged to
do that so and we don't push ourselves
to it because they're like but why looks
like an a-hole yeah and then they're
always gonna side but I have too many
thoughts I can't stop but yeah I you
meditate so I'm going to just run
through a few questions that I like on
Twitter I've asked you guys what you
kind of wanted to know or um almost like
what I went into like the questions I
asked Rochelle when she first came and I
had a chat with us about um that might
help answer some questions some myths
maybe and then you can kind of get you
guys um to start your own
anyways meditation and why you should do
it because I'm just saying straight up
like I highly recommend it I'm sure
Rachelle Kim yeah and like she does it
said to live literally before I
meditated I was such a messed up monkey
and I love meditation because I was
severely depressed in a really bad place
really really anxious and it was
literally the thing that saved me that
has just made me such a happier more
optimistic person like I'm tripping like
ah who sees her happiness video and I
get it why I got it but before that I I
was not a really good monkey I wasn't in
a good place and meditation just helped
me so much when I first started I it was
like this magic pill for me it's just
something that I kept doing and over
time it just became amazing like it it
was a slow process definitely it wasn't
like I just started meditating and yeah
I read her and I was in a really bad
place it wasn't like I was first
meditation session oh I'm healed no I
was in a really really nasty place and
it's a lot harder to learn meditation
when you're kind of like at your edge so
yeah and then I found that and I was
just have so many benefits from it and I
just kept showing up kept meditating
kept doing it kept getting more
interested in it really goes like once
you kind of touch service if you're not
I feel like a lot of you guys are
probably that watch this I know a lot of
you guys like talk to me about all sorts
of things with like like spirituality
and I know a lot of you already really
connected people and with yourselves and
or at least getting on that path so if
you want to like either one find a way
to get more connected with yourself to
either I don't know Kobe for
creativity-wise you can pay for just
stress relief or like just finding
self-love and getting over certain
things in your life that I got you know
negativity in yourself meditation like I
mean is a really great way to just
connect with you the one most important
thing is knowing that with meditation
like and what you know I've been
learning as I've been going like because
I'm still on my like learning path with
it it's just that it doesn't happen
overnight
and you have to persist though I have to
keep showing all of us like they live in
a house like my roommate tonight ishe
will say I have in mid tell ya like if
one of us are like a Crabby or something
but like gamma take on like have you
meditated no all this is why I like and
it's so so true there are two beautiful
excuses one is I don't have time and
meditation gives you time so I'm going
to take for 20 minutes a day twice a day
but anytime that you do if it's 10
minutes 5 minutes giving us solve that 5
10 15 20 minutes we'll give you time
because you are just so much less
frazzled and caught up and so much
clearer so when life throws you things
rather than reacting to them straight
away and kind of just be torn by other
stuff you're just coming and living
through life in such a calm are more
peaceful more present way and you're
just more of an observer and less of a
reactor and so when people say they
don't have time I my line is do you have
time to feel like shit yeah that's one
thing and the other ones that is the
brilliant one which I even use when I
first started meditating is but I have
too many thoughts I can't stop my head
girl that's why I'm gonna take the point
that Rochelle is about to make is
something that I think lots of like
young girls or young boys are just like
teenagers growing up will connect with
growing up this is what we do is take it
away so you know the crazy voice inside
your head the bitchy voice the one that
tells you you're not good enough you're
not smart enough you're not pretty
enough you're not skinny enough you
can't do that you're you're they're just
the limitations like it's just limiting
your chatter hello
the chatter in your skull is the little
monkey mine I call up my psychopathic
bitch friend yeah she's now a friend cuz
we live like two bogeys is sad um my
girlfriend's melissa wrote a book on it
and she called it her main girl and it's
this voice and we all have it I have it
it's this thing that just constantly is
there that we live with and we think
that the voice is real we think that
that's ours if that's us we think that
when our mind says oh no you can't do
that or oh no no your
never be as good as that you believe
that I feel like that voice is almost
like it's it's almost like a negative
vortex and it picks up all of those
stereotypical grabbing on disguise
negative things that people like to
throw up people to stop them from doing
something to control people to put them
in a box and just the limitations that
other people are putting in you like
that bitch in your head is literally
picking up all of that and it can be
hard to differentiate yourself from the
beach it is in essence fear and what is
fear false evidence appearing real
yeah first step with I guess getting
over that and getting over a lot of
other things is like especially also
going to meditation is realizing that
you are not the crazy busy.i ahead you
all subjects up the fact that you don't
want that to be you cannot manifest on
it like yourself do I want to continue a
life like this or what I like to be
happy and if the answers yes don't think
there's no hope and I think that's right
out of this always done yeah I just
think like this is me that's me forever
and I'm never going to change there is
ways and there is hope and there's so
many good people in the world and yes
I'm going any tools for your toolbox and
meditation is one of them the gradual
process of meditating now for two and a
half years she's still there I'm not
gonna lie you she's not going to just
magically go away it's your ego to me
girl this is this is part of you but the
volume on her is just like turndown and
every time I meditate
she turns down a little more it's just
knowing that within you that it's not
you and yeah so nice to know it I mean
like so many people like just need to be
told that because it's like you deep
down you know that is true like when I
heard that when Michelle said I was like
ah yeah but you like you don't remind us
know what other people taste like cut it
has a crazy voice inside of it like I
have a crazy voice inside man but it's
not you know that to feel sad and I've
read a bit on this wonderful side your
letter feel anxious your letter feel
nervous and scared but it's about how
can you deal with it and finding those
ways you'll go to things and I think
before meditation I definitely had a few
things I would always say sit down or
maybe write or just have some moments by
myself I got into crystals and
spirituality that way
go to the beach like exercise feel my
money with goodness and I'm a little
thing now I want to talk about how
meditation on top of all that has helped
and so you get in the building blocks it
really is and as you go with it it just
gets stronger and you can feel the
results more and more thumbs us I kept
one of the pros and cons of meditation
yeah straight up my cock I don't have
any kind Sam's look you can kid yourself
and saying all it takes time oh oh it's
hard it's the most meditation should be
the most effortless thing that you do
sit down and do nothing and it is so
simple and people shouldn't over
complicate meditation at all which is
done a lot the pros are just like how
long is the video booster positivity and
early mental clarity even for think
straight I feel relaxed a bit more
relieved it's like I don't know anything
yes energy energy I think they're
getting choice on well without like a
clogged head you I feel so heavy anymore
now that you know how easy it well it's
not it's just it's why you should do it
and like they're just on background
there and this is our information I
guess like I just wanted to bring this
up as a kind of thing it to open up you
guys to maybe your own research into it
or like to start practicing it and
there's so many or focusing on you know
those meditation classes but the thing
is it's I don't go to a class like you
literally do it from home like all I do
to meditate is um maybe in the morning
before I'm about to maybe edit or film
or go for background or something I will
just grab a pillow and go out to my
veranda maybe like either by myself or
with Jordan or my other roommates I put
my alarm on for like 15 minutes and
sometimes you can play meditation music
if you want most of the time I just
listen to the birds and try and connect
with what is around me and we just cross
my legs and Georgie taught me like hands
down and you need us to ground yourself
and then hands um like palm down is like
to receive information there's all
different sorts of things like with that
so there's so many like one thing to say
here is there's so many different ways
to meditate yeah
and there are not any necessarily right
I'll enroll it's just what's right for
you but if I'm like feeling with him
thinking too much what I do is I simply
just try and focus on my breath so focus
on breathing in and breathing out and a
great one that my roommate Jordan always
like told me is breathe in positivity
and exhaling activity one that I think
you guys could all try at home if this
videos inspired you and you'd like to
look into meditation is a little
five-minute meditation set your alarm
for five minutes go find somewhere once
don't get on your bed if you don't your
bed you've got a signal to your body
that's like hot behind ya ah and you
will fall asleep and that's just going
to happen so find someone really
comfortable outside wherever silent put
your phone on airplane mode is an
absolute must
then sit there put your timer on for
five minutes and then just sit there
with your legs cross hands open hands
shot whatever and then breathe in and
out slowly but on your inhale one and
then to not go up to ten slow as slow as
you can really kind of conscious of your
breath you go up to ten and then just
restart you're not counting the reason
you count is it's just something for
your mind to focus on but the thing is
when you go in to meditate people is
gonna be perfect
I started thinking I have at least not
wrong and that's not wrong just don't
judge it like the reason I the counting
on for five minutes is great is because
just one two and then ten and then start
again and you're not it's something
accounting it's like by like one you
know - don't be like a we're like a care
go to get the count going it is shit I'm
something to distract your mind oh yeah
okay so yeah as you can see we're very
passionate about the subject important
and it helped like both of us I think
I'm so grateful that you want to talk
about Owens right yeah I thought you re
doing no I really want to get like the
message in meditation are then it's not
just some hippie voodoo thing like
everyone can incorporate into our life
and it should be incorporated in if you
want to live yeah a happy happier more
positive life and find like-minded
people and list goes on we're gonna
leave leanest to
like that you should know you have this
only guy Rachelle's channel to cuz you
guys know that I like em such an editing
fiend like videos that make me feel good
as like I guess what I like to put out I
love watching Rochelle zeroes because
they make me you know one again live and
that's the sort of content you want to
like watch there's so much bullshit on
the internet fine channels or find
something gets your brain thinking and
stuff that makes you feel motivated and
have a love for life and I think
Rochelle channel that goes laughing yeah
they're grateful that I got to like sit
