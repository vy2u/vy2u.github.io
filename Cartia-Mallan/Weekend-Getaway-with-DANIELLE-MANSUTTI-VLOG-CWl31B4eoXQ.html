Byron and it's been a crazy like past
few days I've got no makeup on sorry
we're just kind of like got out of the
beach and then drove back to Brisbane
but we're on our way now to go pick up
Danny from the airport and then we're
driving down to Burleigh and we're
staying there for a little bit and it's
gonna be really fun but we're running
really late to pick up Danny it's really
hard so I've just found some funnies for
a Danny to scout
oh and hey guys I didn't even didn't
even though you guys are San ECL looking
beautiful they actually had eyes
ammoniac come we get outfit we're here
and we're gonna go find where this place
is because I don't actually have a clue
where it is okay so we're at the place
we found the key it was hidden under
here and this is the time to shine
number two okay
Danny's walking yeah I'm vlogging easy
is not vlogging because she's not a
youtuber and I can't even get the door
unlocked
either Oh awesome look at this place
look how funny my bag of looks everyone
else's look normal
we're just enjoying our bag on a bug off
next to the beach pretty sunset is just
hanging out on the balcony right now hey
gal oh caught caught doubles blogging
that's such a bad angle me in there the
tennis thing yeah did you guys do toilet
tennis wait now let's show them so you
come into the toilet here and okay so I
say you sit down on the toilet when it
says toilet tennis look left you look
left it says look right you look right
it says look left and it just keeps
going back but if you look this way
first and you know you look left
you're there and it's just like the same
thing over and over again my god yeah
we're just not really doing much night
because we're really tired
we're gonna walk down to the beach and
get some food and stuff and eat on the
beach now and yeah we actually haven't
done anything tonight we're just
relaxing which is good because that's
what we all wanted to do so we did it
such a nice day today the weather's like
perfect so just got enough and we have
to remove my with the popped and
Micah meet a parking spot and I don't
want to get like a ridiculous bill fine
leaving it though so we're going to
remove it now and then get dressed
something done and I'm going to
video dry collab videos for us just to
get them like done on the road so we can
head down to the beach and just lay
there all day do nothing
okay so Danny and I've just finished
filming at the what's the challenge and
now we're getting ready and getting all
my stuff sorta we're going to barn for
the day we've decided because the
weather is perfect
and Danny's never been to barn before so
it's her first time and we're going to
show her water goes beat'em on art and
some shops and just see it's gonna be
really really busy there though so I
think it's going to be kind of hard to
get into bar today really long so
we'll go grab some breakfast now and
then start heading down
we just got smoothie is this is the
best-tasting smoothie I've ever had in
my life that is a big cool Hobart
it's like banana honey and granola and
Danny got like mango passionfruit you
know an easy one is still coming after
barren we go easy in the back of usual
getting my sweat I see it is you'll see
and smiling we get there I don't know
what we're going to do this is going to
show down here
yeah
Johnny how do you like barn so far Kesey
how do you still like bar and even
they've been there like 10 million time
put your head on dance let it free
we're back from Byron now um I left my
camera in the car like literally half of
the day so I filmed a little bit on
Danny's camera and just a bit of random
stuff but pretty much we when dad's Ryan
looked at some of the stores took her to
water goes and then met up with my
friend Henry and he we went to Taylor's
Beach and hung out there for a bit and
then when he got burrito and then we
went to watch these really cool people
play drums it was bongos so I and them
it was so beautiful such a lovely sunset
okay so it is Tuesday today the next day
and I'm yet I'm wearing the same thing
because I haven't gotten changed yet um
we're getting some photos but because I
realized I'm actually taking no photos
on this whole trip since my camera's
been broken on my phone so I'm just
getting someone is this camera so she
cannot send them on to me and today
we're just going to go get some
breakfast now or soon and then go down
to the beach and then head back to
Brisbane and show Danny around there and
