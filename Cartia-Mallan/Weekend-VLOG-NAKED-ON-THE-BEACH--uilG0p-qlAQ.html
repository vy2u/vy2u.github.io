love finally I'm so excited to be
vlogging again um I just thought I would
do this because I finally got a new um
camera charger for my vlogging camera
because I kind of lost it like a few
weeks ago that's why I haven't really
been posting many like vlogs as I
normally would um this weekend I've
pretty much just got to do a whole lot
of school work or like today today
Saturday um just got a whole lot of
schoolwork to get done and if I get
enough done today then I will probably
go out tonight and then tomorrow
hopefully everything's done so I can go
to the waterfall with yazi and from my
other friends from the coast but this
morning I just thought I'd take you guys
through like what I'd normally do on
Sunday morning when I got lots work to
get done so I've just gone to my
bathroom I just washed my face with my
md formulations facial cleanser then I'm
going to go ahead and put on my origins
original skin cream we're going tonight
we currently say this much in here you
guys asked a lot of questions about this
skin cream um after I featured it in my
skit ready with me video again it's what
it was um so I thought I would actually
retouch and talk about this products
quickly in this video now this was
actually a sponsored price that I got
sent like last week it's probably it
want to be best friends I've been sent
it is so good it makes my skin so much
more radiant like I've used it now for
about two or three weeks and I just
noticed my skin has so much more of a
glow back to it you probably can't see
it much in this camera because the
quality isn't as good but as I mentioned
in my karaoke video like it smells
amazing it makes my skin feel hydrated
and glow at the same time so it's got a
product called willow herb in it and it
smells and it's still good so I'm a lot
of you guys ask me where you can get it
you can get it online and I'll put the
link to the product down in my
description box so do you want to check
it out it's down there sorry I just I
know it's annoying to see like sponsors
comments all the time but you guys did
ask to see this one again and for me to
talk about it a bit more because I
didn't really touch on anything about it
besides how nice it is and how
love it
I honestly love just come in sing
outside on the veranda for breakfast
