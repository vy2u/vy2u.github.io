alike right now you reckon you should
look a little bit alike keep nervous are
you you're more confident than me right
now hello everyone I am finally back and
I'm showing with my beautiful mum
hi Mel as you guys all know her
everybody one of the most influential
human made this channel happen you guys
all love her and you know about her so
actually never gotten mum on to this
channel like sitting down with like
you've been in vlogs and snapchats a lot
but never a proper sit-down video so
today we're sitting in my new apartment
I'll just help me move in and we're
going to do a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A so I've just
posted on snapchat for you guys to send
some videos asking us questions and
we're about up in and out and answer
them it's like how to strong weather go
to bottom like you guys you can't the
love you don't answer this honest Allah
people and crying this video I'm gonna
do I've got Syrian army Lala um I think
we buy super blessed to share the
relationship that we do we have a super
open relationship and I think it all
comes down to communication and what he
wanted to ask that question I don't know
what I would do without mom or having
this someone that you always I was there
to speak to or and be honest with ya
it's like having like everyone thinks
worth freaking sisters every time at the
airport like sisters I know but yeah I
think it's incredible and like as I said
I owe a lot to Mum like everything that
I'm doing right now so love you are you
a single parent and
the collector relationship there some
women to adjust to that
sorry I got text file that was sending
but it said you're a single parent and
have you ever been with someone else
and have you heard - have I had a lousy
relationship
the answer to that is yes I've been a
single parent for a very long period of
time on the been over five years
my dad's five years and yes until
probably the last 18 months I have had a
new partner someone that I had known
from very long time ago back in my own
high school years rekindled the
friendship and yes both my kids have had
to adjust to having a new person in
their life for me at first because oh my
god someone kind of dated two other guys
after my parents split up and I was just
not a fan like I'm so protective of mom
whenever they would come over I'd just
be like evil I just couldn't like it was
very hard for me to not it wasn't about
seeing how or someone else it was just
bringing someone else in to our space
because we are so close so I'm just very
protective and I was like venom box her
over I will kill them so with moms we
partner Chris um I kind of like I just
couldn't be nice I couldn't speak to him
but that wasn't because of him was
because of me but now like once since
I've adjusted to him like I freaking
love him like it's I'm so happy they're
like together it's a beautiful
relationship and yeah he's like a like a
big brother but not you know I mean like
he's like a friend supporter yeah he's a
really really cool all of us scary
pretty mom in one bad habit
oh yeah especially right now close to me
go on I would have to say probably her
worst habit is she's not always the
Tydeus person sometimes yes I am
being on top of chores but that's kind
of a mum-mum grab to have I guess she's
um
give us something juicy think of
anything she's she's a pretty good egg
she's um she's very independent and
she's a good cook
and she's a great friend to a lot of
people and a great support so I I guess
I can let the the bad boys go but you
need to practice and I know what
are you most part part year for okay so
the best advice mom has probably ever
given me is she always says wherever
your challenge you're equally supported
and I always this free place in my head
all the time if anything bad ever happen
and she always encourages me to stay
humble and grounded in every situation
and be grateful for all the blessings
that I have happen in our lives my life
and yeah um my proudest moment is just
having her and um doing what she's doing
um I think she's pretty amazing and
amazing I do love you okay I love you oh
that's a good one what would you do if
your mom didn't like your partner
I would probably dump them to be honest
whenever mom makes not a judgment but
like she tells me like her vibe of a
person say she is literally always right
any guy I've seen she's like I get a bad
vibe it never turns out right
so yeah if she didn't like someone I was
dating I think I would probably look I
wouldn't like change the whole situation
just because you didn't like them but I
think it would probably end up trust
your intuition advance the message it
may be awkward but yeah
so don't get along than like you get
between this then it's not gonna
work
hi kya oh jeez I'm getting cheeky why
don't we ever say colonies dad and what
happened Oh Valley it like
um well yeah I guess
cops car Diaz dad and I split up
five nearly six years ago and feature my
dad as much I don't see him that often
I obviously love my dad dearly I care
about him but we don't we're not it's
not like this type of relationship we're
very different um I just don't seeing
him much like our relationships been
through quite a lot over the past four
years so he hasn't we haven't been
around each other enough to kind of
introduce him to you guys we'll bring
him onto the channel maybe one day he'll
make his feature at some point I'd be
more than happy to do that if he's happy
to do that um we're slowly just kind of
like rebuilding our relationship because
it was pretty um and yeah I know I
never speak about it I remember like
mentioned it but it just hasn't been the
right time or place but I think now
within all of us were kind of trying to
heal any wounds get any bad feelings
just eliminated because it was a
time for us you know like it's yeah it
divorce and my parent issues are always
kind of tied breaking up a family yeah
but yeah that's why and um yeah good
question like I am yeah happy to be
honest with you guys about that one okay
she said if you could live anywhere in
the world where would it be
I'm gonna wear it it would be one two
three New York
yes I true though we both love these
eggs and I wanted to us because you and
your mom are so close is it hard like
traveling heaps and like now you're
moved out like you do miss her a lot and
stuff and how do you guys find time
because you're both like so busy and
stuff having fun time to you know be
together and have quality time and all
that good stuff
personally I don't find that that hard
because we literally see each other all
the time we talk all the time like she
calls me yeah as we don't going into my
calls
we have we communicate a lot and like
she is such a big part of my job and my
life where I was in sit we always do
we're working it like ran again like I
don't know for a long time obviously
when I was still managing Katya we did
we traveled together we did everything
we wear that everything we grades we
slept we did at all so I've been super
fortunate to be able to have shared that
experience on my quick her and um and
even though that I'm time with I'm
jeanna mom is like other said she's just
a huge part like I when I don't know how
to protectively paranoia even when I do
travel for longer periods of time like
when I went to LA when I'm in New York
and stuff like we talked like it doesn't
feel like not a brand or way far away so
anyone when I went to LA she came for a
bit like yeah so but I we both love
traveling so we kind of always make it
work
hi guys I was just wondering what you
guys both showed when you advantage
space will stand and you're trying to
set yourself out there after doing um I
have a quite a few go-to things I think
we both do it we both like exercise size
is key um go for a walk girly your hair
Garnier you mum for a while like when
like the divorce is happening should
always remember it's always hard running
like an expressive like go for like I'd
also say try meditate mums recently been
doing um my friend Rachelle her
meditation course well she has a
meditation go and check it out why now
it's my yeah I
Montu going to meditation that it's so
helpful like you guys know I love
meditation comes your head makes you
think composition yeah calms you down in
that moment I also think writing really
helps me when I'm in a bad headspace my
top mum mums button in his journal now
so you can write it all out and you can
make just the you know and it helps you
reflect on that and I guess for me music
music my medicine and I think it plays
well oh yeah sorry for my face you're
the best you're my favorite one I'm from
Chile
oh hey guard yeah how do you do with
long distance relationships well I'm not
really in a long-distance relationship
I'm single as a Oh like I've dated
someone like we're not really dates all
someone that was like an hour flight
away ones that wasn't even their
boyfriend like we won't talk about that
forever alone okay thank you my friend
or boyfriend okay thank me leave me like
recommendations like does anyone want to
hook me out with something beautiful and
come down anytime today hey I was just
wondering what drives you keep pushing
forward in your life and how you
achieved so much watching my mom
literally I have that tattooed on the
body my mom because I owe mom a lot um
because she definitely helped bring a
lot of happiness into my life so I'm
definitely driven to try and give back
to her what she's helped me achieve and
I'm also he's driven by the fact that I
love what I'm doing I love feeling happy
I like following my passions I'm like I
love being creative I'm really creative
person so I'm just driven by
experimenting with new things such a
positive outlook on math like it is
completely elastic everything's really
okay how do you do it I just want to
know
you ever get anxiety and if you do how
do you manage it like to meditate or
what do you do to get it through and
from an old friend I just want to say
you look like you're doing so well in
life you just look so happy and anything
successful for you Oh
Melia guys I went to this chameleon to
go The Descendants huh we were looking
what prep together we were at school for
like nine years yellow thank you for
that do you ever get anxiety and how do
you deal with it um fool one little
period of time like I'd never
experienced anxiety ever in my life
until last shut up okay I didn't know
what it was I didn't know how to deal
with it I got it kind of when before I
went to LA and when I got back I
suffered with it quite badly um I like
it's really random when it kind of comes
on you don't understand it I respect it
we'll have control over because you
don't have control over it's like a
really shitty thing and I think anyone
can get at any time and I kind of dealt
with it through meditation a hundred
percent um reading the power of now
helped me a lot that's why I got the now
tattooed that was just like huge for me
to kind of when you're getting anxious
before your folks gets to do the moment
and just you have to write it out like
it takes time to get rid of it fully get
rid of it sometimes they can come or
whatever but I hope I've suffered from
anxiety for many many years but I
certainly in the last couple of years
mastered I think how to best deal with
it and it is it's combination of all of
those things just do what feels right
and resonates with you that can bring
some calmness into your life so I'll
have the moment and then you know
tomorrow's another day so you know if
you can't kind of wake up with that
mindset like I had a crappy day
yesterday but I'm not going to allow
that to kind of transfer over to today
oh my god she is speed demon and she
still stresses me out
my trillion what
my Airport I feel her move on to the
break every time I like get up close to
rush it pushes down the bracelet like
put their hands up and it's just like
 stars in stressful but she made
it to pick you up from a party when you
will really like drunk you actually has
never had to do one
I haven't specifically but there was one
weekend where I was in Sydney and the
one Nana had to do it so first dad got
me and he didn't deal with my drunk so
very well because I was never came and
rescued you and I was just like
screaming me because he'd never seen me
drunk before and so he was kind of
freaking me out and I was really drunk
and I was with another friend she was
really drunk away but there's like like
man can we get me I just needed like he
says and she was away and then I was
grounded for quite a while after that
let me know so much this question is for
your mom Carter yeah my question is or
two most funny or embarrassing thing
cardia did when she was little I
remember coming out she'd been into my
bathroom and painted her face like a
clown with red lipstick everywhere I

heaps I was like an allowed little
annoying
memory ball like but and we just
literally talked about to everybody

of new friends everywhere I'm just
running when I used to get up on the
stage and sing daddy do you remember

little free-range chicken and she'd go
up and down the street ever do anything
