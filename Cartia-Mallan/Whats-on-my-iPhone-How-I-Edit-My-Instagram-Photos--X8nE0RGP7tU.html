what's on my iPhone video now I get a
lot of different questions from people
asking um what sort of apps do you use
Beauty related and Fitness related and
also what apps do I use to edit my
Instagram photos on my phone I don't
have that many apps I just have the
absolute necessary to me that I use on a
daily basis I wanted to do this video
not only because um you guys asked for
it but I wanted to do it because lately
I've found that some new apps that I'm
really excited about and that I've been
using heat these are like my all-time
favorite apps if you would like to find
out what is on my phone this gorgeous
piece of plastic and please keep
watching this is my iPhone 5 I have a
white iPhone 5 it looks like this case
it is just a white and pink striped case
from Victoria's Secret which my mom got
for me for Christmas and I love it I
think it's so girly and really cute and
I love Victoria's Secret so here is my
phone ok so starting off my background
this is a photo of me my friend kardea
yes we do have the same name Annabel and
Taylor okay so this is my phone unlocked
pretty much I keep on the first page
just the basic stuff that I use heaps
like my photos and some photography
stuff messages Instagram YouTube etc
just the stuff that I probably grab to
the most um I will be coming back and
explaining more about the photography
later on in the video so if you want to
find out more about how I edit my photos
and stuff then stick to the end but I
want to talk about this page first this
is some of the apps that I've used kind
of the most the first one that I guess
I'll just start talking about is this
really awesome app called the hunt one
of my friends told me about this app a
few weeks ago at school and I have just
pain
obsessed with it ever since now honestly
if you're into her clothes makeup Beauty
anything just finding really cool
products this app is so awesome I'll try
and explain it a little bit for you guys
so pretty much when you click onto it
this is like the home screen so it's
kind of like I'll just grab it as like a
newsfeed if people that post all these
photos pretty much say find this photo
on tumblr and you're like oh my god when
she get that dress from and you just
have no idea where to find it well this
is where you come to it you post the
photo on the hunt and you just say you
like make a little caption like someone
help me find this dress exactly or
something similar to this and what
people do is they then comment below
like if they've seen it somewhere they
comment the exactly where you can go and
buy it it's just an app that can connect
you with these outfits or beauty
products that you don't know where to
buy it's just awesome I have found so
many awesome beauty products and storage
compartment things on this app so I
might jump at you and what you can do is
you can follow that hunt and so when
someone does find where to buy it it'll
give you a little alert to say hey we
found where it is and you can go order
it literally I have found some of the
coolest stuff like I found this awesome
speaker it's like a water speaker that I
I didn't even know that they had that
and I found it on the hunt and I'm like
mum we have to order this right now it's
so cool so it's like a one-stop shop
online store for me yeah alright that's
I guess that's what I've got to say
about that app I know sorry I spoke
about it for so long but I can't even
express to you how much I love it it's
so awesome I only have a few apps I do
use the ones that I have like heaps so
this one along with um the neck
two ones that I will show you my
all-time favorite app yesterday
I've got eye bolt which I never use I
don't know why I bothered downloading
this it's just like a private photo
album at which I don't really need to
hide anything so I'll probably end up
deleting that soon because it's
pointless to have there anyway um the
next one that I have is a little photo
editing app called over now this is such
a cool app it's pretty much just like
most photo editing apps you choose a
photo and you can add text over the
photo or edit it I don't use it that
much so I'm not going to talk about in
depth for too long the next app that I
use heaps is SoundCloud now this app I
love but most people know what
SoundCloud is and it's just like a music
um a music app but I love this app
because there's not other mainstream
music like you can find some really cool
mixes and different sorts of mashups and
mixtapes and it's just really fun to
discover some different music and so
that's just that up since I moved from a
really sporty school to an art school
where it's mainly like theatre based and
really academic I don't have time to
play a team sport anymore like I used to
so for me it's really important to make
sure that I still go to the gym and stay
fit throughout the year and stuff so an
awesome app that I have been using um
over this over the past few weeks is
this one called the 5k runner much what
it is is it is like a little running
program so there's weeks and it has like
eight weeks in it and three days for
each week so you only have to do it
three days in a week so you start off
with week one and it's pretty much it's
like interval so you have like a five
minute warm-up and then you run for one
minute and you walk for one and a half
minutes and you do that over and over
again for like 20 minutes or so and then
throughout the weeks it slowly builds up
so that I don't turn this into a fitness
video now pretty much it's just a really
good app to keep you on track while
you're going and just
really good training up I've tried heaps
of different fitness training ups that
they're good but never stick to them
this one I feel like it's so great
forward and easy that it's so simple to
stick to and it's not hard to do it it's
enjoyable because you feel like you're
actually getting something out of it and
yeah I don't know what else to say about
that out but I think it's really awesome
it is called 5k run and moving on
I have also got this app next to it
called picplaypost which most people
know about it's just this app where you
can put collage photos and also videos
in and you can add music and what not is
just fun up the next app or followers
plus I can keep toll of who has been
following me awesome like what a good
idea but it makes me so upset when I go
on and I'm like watching for me so the
rest of the apps on that page just the
games that comes with the phone I don't
have any and there besides what came
with the phone and then I've just got
reminders newsstand videos and stops I
don't use any of those apps at all like
they're just there because I don't use
them I should probably just put them in
one folder but um yeah okay so that's
that for that page just a little recap
of apps I think download definitely if
you don't already have it the hunt and
also 5k run if you're into fitness and
also you know SoundCloud if you're into
music so then the mains once main ones I
definitely use now for my main page on
my phone so this is where I keep are the
apps I use on a minute Lea basis these
are the upset I pretty much addicted to
so you've got my YouTube account where
there
see on my videos if you had already
subscribe go and subscribe so that's my
YouTube account there and then I just
have music notes Maps all that usual
staff productivity like I've got the
weather mail um you know all the usuals
just utilities and whatnot Safari app
store settings um that's all boring
stuff everyone has that but that's Reiki
but just up into the top ok so then I
have my photos oh my god I have like six
thousand nine hundred and something
photos is ridiculous
pretty much just full of selfies and I
don't know I just take photos of
everything that's my photos nothing too
interesting I won't go into depth
because who knows what's in there okay
so this is my photography section now I
have more than just photography apps in
here I've got like my Facebook app and
my snapchat app just so that is my two
social media apps that I keep in there
so for my photo editing apps these are
what I get a lot of questions about like
which ones do I use the most how do I
add it my photos etc I'm going to talk
about them for too long and explaining
too much of how I do it I'll just go
over how the app works and you know play
around with it play around with these
apps and how you like to edit your
photos and I'll just show you some of
the effects that you so here is this go
camera vsco cam I'm not sure how to say
it but um pretty much you have this main
area where you have all of your photos
and whatnot so say you just upload them
to that so you just choose from your
camera roll and you put them in there so
say I want to edit this photo here you
press on a little paintbrush button and
it goes to it
I just have to backspace that because it
already has an effect which is cool
because you can go back and you know
choose a few different ones but this
just has some really cool kind of
vintage effect it has a really nice
finish to the photo so the ones I've
chosen a effect you can save them to
your camera roll or post them straight
to Facebook or Instagram or anything so
that's that the next up I use heaps is
after light they cool same deal you
download the photo into the program so
there's the photo and then what you can
do is you can adjust all of the
brightness saturation everything are all
the levels on this app so you can make
it self tanner or make the photo
brighter or best advice I can give is
just experiment with the different
effects that you can use because that's
how I then found the way which I love to
edit it the most you can also do which I
think heaps of people like is add these
little um light effects like they just
look really cool in photos I use them so
much anymore but I used to be obsessed
with using them and another great thing
that I use is that for heat is putting
borders around my photo so you can add
really cool borders like you know
triangles or circles or my favorites
just using the too white line really
great app and it has some cool editing
effects once again you can post it
straight to all different social media
websites or you can just save it to your
camera roll some other editing apps I
have that I don't use as much but I do
pick frame quite a lot which is just
usual pic frame one and then also Mary
Graham pretty much you get a photo and
then you just go mirrors and then you
can pick any mirror but I love this
somewhere it just puts two little
cardi's next to each other it's just
such a cool app and I've got this red in
one photo under it's just the same it
just has some random little editing
things too so that's pretty much that
for my phone there's nothing too
exciting on here it's just pretty much
like most people's phones but maybe not
as many apps I hope you guys did
take something away from this and you
find any apps that you might also like
to use so thank you all so much for
watching and I hope to see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
