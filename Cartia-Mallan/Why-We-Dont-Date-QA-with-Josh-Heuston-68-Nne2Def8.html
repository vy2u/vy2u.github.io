the place you'd like to travel in the
future favorite place to travel is

just like such a like the coolest city
ever like you go to a club and people
actually like dancing like salsa dancing

dancer those people you like I have no
idea what's going around the lobby and
then they just give you shots and stuff
and we're like us is amazing my favorite
ways I've ever been to
my favorite place I've ever been to is
the Solomon Islands but I went all those
when I was in grade four and it was
completely on top we're not completely
untouched but like majorly untouched and
it was so beautiful and there was no
technology or anything but where I
really want to go is Greece and yet

will hear you're about to black out like
I had an energy for your video you want
to go see my video how did you and Josh
become such good friends
like it to be honest how do we behave
good friends well it's easy because we
work in the exact same industry and we
go to lots of events and stuff but we
just we're literally twins like we're
the exact same person so it's easy it's
just easy to hang out yeah seriously was
it so weird we will go to text each
other the exact same here the exact same
time they're like having an actual twin
this is what I would eat we would be
like I think we should have done the
twin telepathy challenge now together
actually what in the next video we just
five you're gonna have to say it's
like I honestly feel like this is what I
always can you get off get off this okay
this is not my closest friends it's like
on it like honestly my best friends that
I have the minute that I made them it's
just on like it's not like an awkward
though we didn't we never had like an
awkward like let's get to know each
other friendly made we had like a like
it was like a yourself with sussing each
other out where when we first met each
other
Lucas whenever I meet people I just like
very I analyze people it was like hold
on wait ah okay cool they go long but I
was like you can stop analyzing me cuz
I'm like you're doing it too and then
and yeah and then we filmed a video the
next day and then friends friendship
then also how did you guys meet but
that's not what we meant
oh we've got a Twitter event like a year
it was almost more than a year now and I
was his manager at the time came up to
me and was like Josh can't get a photo
with him and I was like it's not cool
and I just like I was so drunk as well
and there's this absolutely horrendous
photo of us on the in
it's so exciting I've got to be a nurse
we looked so like yeah it was just not
real whoa I'm really thankful that we
glowed up early so we met at that event
and then we didn't see each other for
like a year later anything Josh hit me
up on Instagram I mean I did did she
like ages a just before we even met and
I was like I did I was like Jonas she's
sorry because I felt like you'd be cool
and then like she was like yeah and then
she never applied to me after that I was
like I'm cool I forgot about that I
remember um if it was your last day on
earth and you could do anything you
wanted to go any way you wanted to what
would you do oh wow your first that's a
hard one I would definitely be by the
beach somewhere oh my like Alexis
friends with like some Aperol spritz
some red wine like a just a nice face on
the beach and just eat and drink and
then go swimming and buy the meteorite
whatever Oh a tsunami just boom and I'd
be very satisfied your hair cool yeah I
go out the beach anywhere on the beach
with some people that you love
and you can just all hold hands and be
like that's a really intense moment I
think it I feel so safe though because
like if I was like a selfie and I always
say we're like we're gonna die together
that's just weird
that's like it well I guess I don't yet
whether love is that Juliet um what's
your favorite thing about your
friendship with Josh I guess you like
red wine red wine yeah the similarities
which might not make hanging out so easy
just easy so similar I just it's so easy
having friends that understanding
understand each other and also
understand what your goals are you know
Jo cannibal
yeah like I think I like that I'll push
you and you pushed me to like do good
things I think
employee out of it and you can just talk
about any ideas something it's not gonna
be like oh like that's so lame ya know
it's like it's a supporter I should be
like oh I'm not receiving friendship
yeah I can be like oh I have this idea
where like I want to get a sailboat and
then film this thing underwater and
you're like yeah cool and then you're
like I'm gonna buy a moped tomorrow I'm
like go for it by his help with my face
like that's good we want to be an
actress in the future yes I do want to
be an actress and you wanted acting -
how do you have an actor
well some I have to do like three years
of classes if you switch lives for a day
what is one thing you would do would you
do if you had my life for a day my god I
know exactly what I do what would you do
I would get Charlie no Charlie policy
stuff I would go get Charlie
yeah and take her on a little gallows
trip with okok and we would do you're
saying she's a bad info just want to
hang out with us sorry bad I feel like
we're so similar like we'd get along so
well actually I want to hang out with

like I would have like the fattest a
name with your month if we could change
lives and I'm how did you both get
booked for the soup of cruel music video
so um the servitor boy is Jesse and Matt
and my really good friends I was in the
first film clip and they asked me to
come and do another one yeah and they
said who should we get in it and I was
like you should get Josh because we
literally look like twins and I thought
it would just be like okay good yeah not
so good terrible I don't know if you
haven't seen it I'll link it below go
and watch it yeah that's cool that was
like instinct - Wow first impressions of
each other
I read that just okay first impressions
of each other we're talking so Nathan or
to me did you already make your edit
there's not even really take it
okay first questions I was like well you
jumped out of the cab with jacket and
then like I gave you a hug to say hello
and I was like she's all good I'm okay
you okay when I first met you I was like
oh this is gonna be a long night
I was like the state serious yeah what
was your first impression I didn't think
it was awkward well I think I was so
preoccupied because Jack was really
judgmental now so I'm gonna have to look
after baby yet I was stressed when I
first thought I had spa I was stressed
my first impression of you was I was
like wow I looked just like this man
and then as you started talking I was
like wow you also think the exact same
way as me and I just showed that you
were easy to get along with my camera
died and then Josh had to go pick up his
sister
so we're refill mning and George didn't
get the memo to wear the same okay
actually I said do you want me to wear
the same shirt yeah no don't worry about
it and then you're wearing the same
clothes because you didn't clean
yourself so we're gonna come back and we
are back well you couldn't come back
like that we're just gonna keep going
for questions like what was what we had
dream jobs were new young girl wanted to
be a vet when I was little like a vet
read an arien that's it really my first
one was I wanted to be the truth fairy
like literally in great terms and I
wanted to honestly I just remember being
young I wanted to be an actress I was
like mommy I wanna be famous no I'm like
frame time when both equally in it and
last time you were pushing me to the
side as well and I was awkwardly better
wait yeah I feel like we're equally
sharing is right now whatever what gives
you the inspiration to create new ideas
for making short films slash montages
and what do you use to edit them I get
my ideas from no we're just having fun
and like actually doing stuff like
outside in the outside world
mm-hm running about running amok rotting
little cool painted he's both
honestly anything comes up they get one
of my stuff when I'm asleep then I
randomly wake up in the other night was
that bright and she's on a piece of
paper if I can remember it but then half
the time I wake up in my house I feel
like also music majorly like if I hear
something that I'll like like a video to
the song or if you go running I can
always like picture a whole like those
things yeah sequences in my head and
then I use Final Cut how do you just
premiere pro a fans have a name
no the Milan's the melons what's yours
Josh's the Houston's no the Houston
aiders that's cool actually that's a
good question we were to come up with a
name for your fan base what would you
call us what would you call them like
the Q is that cool this a good hue spa
have a kids am group but life is nice I
like that that's my nickname

like oh let's go to Greece I'm actually
I'm gonna do that okay we're gonna do
that don't it's not next year yeah
