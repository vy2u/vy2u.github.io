now ready to go over and
Haley mal oh okay so I just finished up
a little lunch meeting with stylehaul
and Krista and stuff we're just having
chat getting to know each other and
whatnot
and then so now I just have a little bit
of time and I'm gonna take some pics in
my my poly outfit and then I'll be
heading down to the like master class
new year and Krista and I are hosting
that or doing like some Q&amp;amp;A and is
having a chat and stuff so I'll be
really cool to meet you guys there this
is broken the yeah I think it was is
broken so we're just holding it like
standing product pretending it's like a
wall it's working well it is it's a
really good back dream look if you put
it down it just looks like I'm weirdly
up against some sort of wall yes that's
what's happening and I've been really
sick all day like I'm just really tired
you know because they're really back
home
I'm going crazy now okay
I'm gonna prove you about what you've
been doing
and how it all works how it all happens
so grab a chair or get nice and cozy I
think it's all working out pretty well
yeah it's so much fun like I genuinely
get so much back from it and I think
it's really cool to also help other
young women or or is anyone that wants
you know like not only beauty tips that
like some life motivation I guess I like
to hear saying that if I've got a
following a mess or do something with
this story for you started I guess
progressing and you were getting you
know like people subscribing to your
channel and what does that feel like
like the attention comes from outside of
your community needs organic what does
that feel like weird it is so strange
it's like you don't ever expect it to
happen because you like you guys just
like us we are all just normal girls
like you know and I think once you start
getting this attention and it's almost
like what did I do to deserve this sort
of thing I remember my first 600
subscribers I did a giveaway and I was
like hey I was like oh yeah what is your
like legit what is yours to set up for
the videos that you're doing now
compared to when you first started
uploading videos I'll let you go first
on us okay I'm no longer using books to
prop up my camera I think that you can
look at how it starts right yeah your
bedroom or your momjo
it's like I had brighten my life bedside
lamp lighting my face like a bright
yellow I know if any of you guys have
watched when my first videos I'm most
Awkward person I'm there like I am kind
of new but I had I had my book set up I
had that's what was on Apple laptop and
I only like recently got a tripod on
lighting like I'm a late bloomer others
from a laptop laptop camera just in
selfie just had the weekend playing in
the background got a copyright strike
what it's a cool time because I think
also another thing is YouTube's becoming
much more accepted between a teen
audience I mean between your friends and
stuff a lot of people always elect me
like I'm too nervous to start one
because something bullying me for it a
cool name
about me being you too and I mean when I
started being honest the only people
that were rude to me about it with
people I know because they were really
yeah I was longing yeah and it's just
it's just small lineups yeah you know
and it's yeah getting past it and just
accepting it being like I don't care
what you think like this is what I love
to do I don't even worry if someone's
gonna say anything bad you just stay
true to who you are and you're like I
love this I'm having fun so that's it
you're having fun why would you bother
