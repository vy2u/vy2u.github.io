into the running to win a 30 minute
mentoring session with me all about like
vlogging vlogging filmmaking literally
whatever you want to talk about for 30
minutes of mentoring so this is a really
cool idea to collaborate with eight
seconds to do this so I could offer you
guys like a mentoring session I really
like to the idea of it and I could come
up with whatever competition I wanted to
do so I came up with the idea for a
competition to capture your essence in
eight seconds so pretty much all you
have to do is cut together a little
video an eight second video of what you
feel captures your essence for me this
is the video that I created
so I just quickly cut that video up in
final cut and got some clips together
that I thought really captured my
essence at festivals and all that fun by
the kind of stuff so if you guys want to
enter this competition to win - people
are gonna win that and that's just gonna
be either over the phone
sky whatever if you guys want to enter
just click the link below it will have a
link to my 8 secconds profile page with
