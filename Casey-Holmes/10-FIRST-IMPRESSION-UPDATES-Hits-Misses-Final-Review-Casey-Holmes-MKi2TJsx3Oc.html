my first impression updates and I did
two first impressions videos showing you
multiple products and I told you guys
that I was going to do an update video
so that is what I am doing today a few
things have been returned some haven't
that should be returned and then there
are some things that I really do love
that you have seen multiple times so
first I'm going to share with you guys
the things that I did return and that
are no longer in my possession anymore
and the first thing is a Marc Jacobs
cover stick in green and the reason why
I returned that is because I did like
the finish of it and I felt like it
wasn't super grainy so it didn't give a
green tint to your skin once you blended
it and it just looked really natural and
really did correct that redness which is
the purpose of the product and I really
did like that part of it the only thing
I didn't like is I do have a larger
pores and a lot of things tend to settle
into my pores and unfortunately that did
so I didn't feel like working with it
anymore and I didn't like the way that
it looked you know on my skin by itself
or underneath foundation just because I
could really tell it was like sunk into
my pores so that's why I returned it if
you do have a lot of redness on your
skin but you don't really have that
issue of large pores you might really
like that product because it did blend
really easily and it did look so natural
it's the most natural green corrector
that I have tried but personally it just
didn't work for me and then the last
thing that I return is the niggas gotcha
Covered concealer I think we all knew
that I was going to return this
concealer because first off it did have
great coverage like I'm telling you it
was just so thick and it made me extra
oil II and it was just gross it did not
last on my skin at all it just did not
work for me if you have oily skin I
would not try it out personally and if
you have dry skin I would say try it out
but just be aware that is very creamy
and I mean if that that's a good thing
that it's really nice and creamy but for
me it just did not settle on my skin
well at all
it just is a bad go it look real bad it
looks so good at first and what you said
it was great but literally like two
minutes later it was a disaster so the
first one is this al Genest reveal
concentrate color correcting drops and I
like this idea I like the idea of the
proper and mixing it with foundation or
putting it on first but I personally
didn't notice a huge difference with
this this is another product that should
be going back because I don't feel like
I would get a lot of use out of it
because it doesn't do what I want it to
do I feel like I've been having a lot of
trouble with green correctors and trying
to find the perfect one that I really
love because unfortunately there has not
been one that I've incorporated into my
routine and that I have just been
floored with and if you guys are new to
my channel you don't know I know I
mentioned this a lot if you watch me but
I do have rosacea so a green corrector
if I could find the perfect one would be
huge for me and I would love that but
honestly I just have not found one that
knocks some socks off yet so again this
one is just not one of my favorites and
I didn't even like it apply to directly
to my skin and when I blended it in with
foundation it did not counteract the
redness like I wanted it to so did not
like this that was pricey so I need to
figure out how to return that one and
the next thing I have in here is this
soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a blot primer I
love this I love it I love it I think
it's amazing this is a product I have
incorporated into my daily makeup
routine even if I'm not going to apply
makeup and I apply my primers I will
apply this just because it really
minimizes the look of your pores and it
controls your oil throughout the day
it's such a smooth primer I love this
you could get it on ultra calm that's
where I got mine I did see soap &amp;amp; Glory
inside my Ulta the other day when I went
in there but I did not see the makeup
stuff so I'm not sure if they're going
to bring this in store but they
definitely have it online since we're on
the topic of soap &amp;amp; Glory I might as
well just tell you about this one heck
of a blot foundation that I also tried
and again I love this I love the line I
also have the powder from this line and
it is so good if you have larger pores
I'm telling you you will love this the
only thing that completely sucks about
this foundation line is the color range
the color range is just not good they
need more colors they really need to
expand that line I'm guessing they're
just wanting to you know put it out on
the market and see how it works but I'm
just like this is so good you need more
colors so hopefully they come out with
more colors because I'm telling you if
you have larger pores you would adore
this and if you have oily skin this is
your go-to if you can
your color definitely pick it up I have
a few that I mix and match depending on
how tan how not tan I am I really really
love this foundation I had a lot of
questions asking me what I wore on my
trip to Punta Cana and the foundation
that award throughout the humid days and
it was this one and this held up so well
moving on to the benefit or raced pace I
do like this again this is a little too
creamy for my skin I feel like it just
makes me a little too oily in certain
areas I just it's just not my cup of tea
honestly but this is a really great if
you have really intense under-eye
circles I have heard a lot of people
with really bad under-eye circles say
that they love this and lasts all day on
them
it's just something about these pot
concealers and pop correctors if they're
way too creamy for me I just cannot work
with them because they sit on my skin
really weird because it's just so oily
but the ones that I want to tell you
guys that is really good that I have
been trying it's a little more on the
drier side but it's the NYX dark circle
corrector and this is in light and I
really like this one again it's a little
bit more dry it still is nice and creamy
but it's not as creamy as normal pop
concealers and I really like this one
too correct and then I'll put my Urban
Decay concealer on top and it's perfect
and it just looks so good throughout the
days the last green corrector I have
here is the Urban Decay Naked skin okay
I love this line I currently have the
peach corrector underneath my eyes right
now really love it by the way I haven't
talked about it but I really love it and
I use this one of my videos and a lot of
people were saying it looked like it
made my foundation have a green tint to
it but I really think that it was the
color of the video because my foundation
did not look green in person my hair
even looked a little green in that video
I didn't have a problem with the white
balance if I have my windows closed and
things like that but in person my
foundation didn't look green I feel like
this is a great corrector I absolutely
love the naked skin line from Urban
Decay it's beautiful it is so hard for
me to get away from The Naked skin
concealer just because I think it's one
of the best it looks so good on the skin
it doesn't sink into your pores anything
like that but it is not something that
I've incorporated into my daily routine
mainly because I feel like I can get
away with not using this and just using
a full coverage foundation which
has been the soap and glory one heck of
a blot I could not use this by itself
and put this on and go out throughout
the day because it's way too green it
has that really intense green pigment I
just wonder I always use full coverage
foundations I do not like medium
coverage foundations or anything like
that just cuz I have a lot to cover so I
don't know how this would act with a
medium foundation or light color
foundation I think it would probably
show through with a green tip but to me
this is not like a must-have this
obviously you can tell them on the fence
oh this one because I do like it
underneath my full coverage foundations
but it's just not it's not like wow I
love it it's in my everyday routine you
know okay the next thing is a blush this
is the lorac buildable blush I forget
what color I tried but it's the same
line this one is in the color prism and
I love it I love this line of blushes
I've used all of the ones that they sent
me and I think they're amazing this
packaging is the most sleek beautiful
packaging I have seen on a blush yet I
love that they have the color on the
bottom and you can see through the lid I
think this is just a great formula a
great line I love it I just saw that
they came out with highlighters I think
they came out like yesterday and I want
to get my little paws on them but I just
haven't been able to yet and they look
beautiful so can't wait to share those
with you guys but the blushes are
definitely a hit go check them out I saw
a lot of uLTA and they were just oh my
god they're so beautiful last blush that
I also love that is from NYX is the
ombre blush oh gosh this is like the
most beautiful presentation of a blush
I've ever seen I love it I love the
color it's just so warm and beautiful
and golden it didn't look like it there
but I promise you there we go
it's just a gorgeous golden warm blush I
love it I love love love this I think it
is beautiful now if I'm sunburned I
ain't gonna wear this because this has
more of a warm undertone to it so then
I'll just make me look extra red like if
I'm the color I am now this looks so
beautiful I mean it does look beautiful
with a really dark tan as well but
that's when I start to get a little bit
more on the warm side but if I have more
of kind of like a yellow tone to my skin
I feel like this looks beautiful
I just I love it I love this blush I
know that they have a few more shades
but this one was the one I knew I would
go to this is the color new to me it
blends out really well it's very very
pigmented and I feel like a little bit
goes a long way so you could have this
forever the only thing that I wish is
that this top was clear so you could see
it and see the beautifulness of the
blush but that doesn't break it for me I
think this is awesome
okay and then the last thing is actually
what I mentioned in my March hits and
misses and it was in my misses category
so I got a lot of misses I had like a
really kind of I don't know if you call
it balanced but I had a lot of hits and
a lot of misses with these first
impression products so this is the Tarte
hybrid gel foundation in medium honey
the true test for this was when I was in
Punta Cana and Georgia gets really
really humid and really hot to the point
where your girl does not want to wear
makeup because I'm like it's gonna sweat
off my oily skin is just gonna look
disgusting I don't want to do it Punta
Cana was a great test for a lot of these
first impressions because it wasn't like
that here in Georgia yet this did not
hold up well at all in the humidity in
the heat on my oily skin I don't know
how it would be with dry skin but for me
it was bad but like when I was in the
hotel room and I put this on I loved the
finish of it I even asked Davis I was
like do you like this I feel like it
looks really good he really liked it and
it's just such a beautiful foundation
once you put it on but man when I went
outside and I was getting hot and my
oily skin I could just I could feel it
coming through if you have really oily
skin you know that feeling when you have
foundation on and you feel like your oil
is just kind of pushing through and like
creating its own foundation that's how I
felt and it didn't last really long on
my skin at all and it just it just did
not work for me unfortunately so maybe
if you have more dry skin you would like
this like I said in my hits and misses
maybe in the winter time I could
probably wear this since it'll be more
you know of a dry climate but Georgia
would tell me heck no in like five
seconds if I walked out the house in
this okay so that is it for the first
impression updates I really hope you
enjoyed it don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you want me to continue
these first impressions and the first
impressions updates they
what I'll do is the same as what I did
this time and film two different first
impressions videos with a bunch of
products keep trying them out and then a
couple weeks later give you a full
update and then just go like that with
two videos then one update two videos
and one update that way we have quite a
bit of products to talk about and we
could kind of knock these out you know
I'm saying cuz there's a lot of new
makeup coming out and it is really hard
to keep up so I've been loving the
multiple first impressions and I'm glad
you guys are too so thank you so much
for watching I hope you enjoyed this
video and I will see you guys in my next
one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
