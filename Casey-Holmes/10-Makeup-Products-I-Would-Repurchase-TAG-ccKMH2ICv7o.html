one that was requested by one of my
friends on Twitter I will put her
Twitter name right here she's super
sweet so basically it's the 10 things I
repurchase if I lost on my makeup tag I
looked up some videos on it and it was
just about like if I lost all my makeup
what were the 10 things I would go out
and repurchase right then I have to high
end but it also have a lot of drugstore
most of it is drugstore so pretty happy
about that I really do love these
products and I highly recommend them I
will also be tagging some specific
people down below and feel free to do
this if you're watching if you're not
tagged it don't matter I tagged
everybody so but I'll just have a few
people down below if I specifically tag
so let's get started the first thing I
would repurchase is this Mac Paint Pot
this is in soft ochre and I've actually
had this for a while now probably about
I say a year and a half and look at how
much product I have left in this bad boy
like I have so much more product left
it's insane
I've had it so long it's just been like
a great investment that I made I think
it was like fifteen sixteen dollars I'm
not too sure but it's a great primer I
do have oily lids so this is nice I love
it I know a lot of people have pain
early but personally I like soft ocher
so and you can tell I did try to film
this once secret secret okay next is
concealer now I didn't mention this in
my concealers video because a lot of
people when I mentioned it in the past
said that they couldn't find it but then
whenever I posted that video they were
like well why didn't you mention it and
I'm like well because somebody says I
can find it and I don't want to
recommend something to you guys and like
be all hyped up about it if you
personally cannot find it but I had
people tell me they found it at Ulta
targets stuff like that so go check out
your local drugstores some people might
have it some people don't but since some
people said that they did find it I
decided to include it because it is one
of my favorites
it's the Revlon age defying concealer
and mine is in medium I love this and if
you get the right color you can use it
underneath your eyes and on your face
and let me just tell you this brightens
your under-eye so amazingly even if it's
a little bit too dark you can always
take just the lighter concealer
underneath which is what I do sometimes
and just tap it in with your finger and
you're good to go so I love that
concealer so much sticking with eyes
we're going to go ahead and I'm going to
show you the Naked palette I would
definitely have to repurchase this I
feel like if I did I wouldn't have to go
out and purchase any other eyeshadow
palettes for a very long time because
this one just has every color I would
mean I could do a very light I go into
the darker colors and do more of a
smokey eye it's just one of my favorites
a lot of you have seen this it's not a
new thing so I love this palette it's
totally totally worth the money
also for liner this is actually what I
have all my eyes today my liquid liner
is the elf waterproof eyeliner pen I
absolutely love this it's a felt tip
liner so that's what it looks like some
people get bad ones of these but I've
always gotten the really good pens I've
never had a problem of mine and this
one's lasted me for forever and if
you're wondering this is the swatch
right there so it's really nice
pigmented and I do like the fill tip
because it kind of wears down a little
bit so it makes it easier to apply the
liner but I really like it it's one of
my favorites and I feel like if I had to
just go purchase it this is only a
dollar so it'd be great I love it for
pencil liner I would definitely go with
the L'Oreal hip liner at first I didn't
like this because it was super harsh but
as I've used it more I really liked it
it's the like I said L'Oreal hip liner
so it's just a pencil liner no big deal
I am for my Sierra this should probably
come as to like no shock to any of you
um it's the covergirl LashBlast volume I
love this mascara it's just been my holy
girl I love it so much it's been the
only one I've used since I even found
out about this mascara and purchased it
it literally lengthens and volumizes and
separates so well not to mention it
holds a curl like nobody's business like
I don't have to curl my lashes when I
use this it's just that I had just soft
it but it's
just that amazing so love that mascara
okay on to face is just like my favorite
I love face products this is also no
surprise to you guys I would recommend
or I would go out and buy the cover top
10 powder from Physicians Formula my
all-time a favorite powder I actually
have one on my vanity right now and then
I have this one as well
I repurchased so many of these this
isn't transparent medium but it's just
my all-time favorite and I could just
set my concealer and my face with this
so I love it it's my favorite powder
from the drugstore ever like seriously
it's so freakin flawless and then for
blush and bronzer I decided to go with
this wet wild bronzer which I know I
haven't talked about at all really on my
channel or at all actually but I got
this at the in the last month and I've
been using it throughout this month and
I really like it I just sort of use it
in a three motion on my face and it's
wet and wild bronzer and this isn't
princess and it's just really nice to
kind of dust in that in the areas where
the Sun would naturally hit you so
that's what it looks like it's just my
favorite one that I've gotten from the
drugstore so far I think it's really
nice and it just gives you that really
nice glowy kind of bronzed look so I
like that and I think it's only like
$2.99 so that's a steal and then I also
for blush had to pick this hard candy
Fox in a box this is in spicy and sweet
and that's what it looks like and you
can just mix them all together or you
can pick certain colors if you want and
that's a swatch of that it's just
beautiful I love this blush so much so
for Low's a lot of you probably know
that my lips are naturally like lighter
and I don't really do much with them but
I do put lip balm on them and this is my
favorite one I would definitely have to
go purchase this again it's the Burt's
Bees
I'm tinted lip balm and this is in tiger
lily and it's just a very natural kind
of skin tone color it's not really nude
like they say it is but that's just what
it looks like and then I'll show you a
little swatch so just kind of amps up my
lip color a little bit and it just is
really moisturizing and like my favorite
one ever so
definitely this and that is all of my
products that I would repurchase I hope
you guys enjoy this if you don't want to
leave a video response then totally let
me know in the comments what are some of
the products that you would repurchase
if you lost everything so like I said I
will tag some specific people in the
down bar and everybody feel free to do
