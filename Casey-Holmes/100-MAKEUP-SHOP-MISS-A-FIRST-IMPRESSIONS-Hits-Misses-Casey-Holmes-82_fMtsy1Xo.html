little bit of what's in here we have a
bomb palette we have something from
cargo we have some ciaté lippies we have
this toothpaste brush there is just so
much stuff in here you guys some
skincare in here as well we've got a lot
of that one this one's the Dermalogica
full-size special cleansing gel I really
like this stuff and this has been
sitting in my closet never used it got
it in PR and I was like I need to give
this away so I figured I would throw it
in here as well hope you guys are
excited a good luck and if you want to
see me try out all this makeup for just
a dollar then let's just go ahead and
get started okay so the eyeshadow primer
that I have here is the AOA Studio
perfect I shadow primer this is one when
we're using today it looks like it has a
nice tint to it and then this is the
applicator I'm just gonna put this on
I'm gonna take this off cuz it's making
noise but this is from my boutique if
you're wondering I'm just going to put
this on my eyes hopefully this counter
acts like any redness and all of that as
you can see it has like a little tint to
it which is nice I have like lash glue
in my lashes so don't mind that this is
like sticking to it just going to blend
this so if I don't have something for a
full face I will just reach into my
collection and get some stuff out but
for the most part I will using all these
products and just testing them out for
you guys so it did kind of even out the
lid which is really nice so far so good
with this primer 2 eyeshadow palettes
and these are all shimmer I didn't mean
to do that so I'm gonna reach for a
matte palette but these are all shimmer
shades they're from the brand amuse you
have these colors right here this one is
the eyeshadow palettes all it says so
I'm used cosmetics I should have power
that's what that looks like we have this
one that is called luster metals and
this is item number fk9 six-30 i don't
know if that helps you buy it or not
this one yeah this one has a little bit
different packaging than this one and
this has like some greens and really
pretty bronze shades so I'm just gonna
go ahead and swatch them woo for a
dollar that is not bad at all mmm that
one's kind of like e.v that was that
middle shade right here that green was
really pretty that actually might use
that and then we have this other palette
right here okay
these aren't terrible I look pretty good
just pull up my Tarte clay play palette
because this is an all matte palette and
we can just use this for whatever shape
we're gonna need it's a really great
palette to have for situations like this
when you just need matte shades this is
great and it also has contour colors in
here even though this video is not about
that I'm gonna take this take take the
shade solstice right here and set my lid
with that just so we have a nice even
base I don't even know what look I'm
gonna
because I didn't get any matte shades
that kind of sucks gonna take a fluffy
blending brush and go in with the shade
journey put this into my crease also
this palette smells like chocolate so
that's always a plus
so this one is amber right here and I'm
gonna put that in my crease as well just
fluffing it all over a little bit more
now that that's blended I really want to
go into this luster metals and take that
green and I want to fluff this into my
crease and actually this is not about
this but I want to try this out it's a
Sonia Kashuk quick clean dry brush spray
I bought this a little while ago and I
bought the sponges and I just haven't
tried it yet this better dry I love this
at cosmetics brush bath it's really nice
it kind of conditions your brushes as
well as cleanses em so if you're looking
for a really good one this is great this
Sonia Kashuk one did the job too and it
smells good too so Mac 217 going into
that green and the palette I'm just
going to fluff this in the outer V
actually I want to use a more precise
brush so I'm gonna clean this one to the
Mac 239 which is a little bit more dense
and you have more control and I just
want to have more control when I put
this green into the crease because I
have a specific place that I want to put
it oh I have it on the brush and I'm
going to take it right out here also
into that crease I'm going to take it in
the inner corner as well but I'm going
to leave the center part open so we're
gonna do like a halo eye so we're just
going to put this out here right here
and crease so far I feel like for a
dollar it's looking really really pretty
I'm gonna go ahead take some on my
fluffy 217 brush and blend
this out so just blend right in that
crease you don't want to go above your
transition shades that you put on this
is actually doing really well I've been
really in love with just putting one of
those kiss blowout lashes on my natural
lashes and bronzer in the crease and
going out because it's so easy and it
looks like I have lash extensions so
highly recommend doing that if you want
a simple look that's what I've been
doing I haven't really done like a super
smoky look in a few days so I feel like
I got a gotta get back into it so again
just kind of taking this in the crease
leaving that center area open for a
lighter shade this is a really pretty
green it's like a four screen it has
gold shimmers in it and it just looks so
pretty so I'm gonna use a clean blending
brush and just try to blend out this
inner corner a little bit more I have a
feeling I'll have to go back in with my
transition color to really make it blend
but that's looking actually a little bit
better so if you ever feel like you
can't get your inner corner to blend
just take a clean blending brush and try
that first before going in with more
product because if you go in one more
product it might just overwhelm the look
and it might be too dark in the inner
corner next up I think I'm gonna take I
don't know if I want to use those shades
and this palette I mean that would be
really pretty okay so I'm gonna go in
with this color that's right next to the
green with a flat brush I'm gonna be
using the Mac 242
just gonna take that color on here it's
looking a little chunky but we're gonna
work with it and I'm just gonna really
push it into the center of the lid yes
looking quite a bit chunky can you guys
see how it's looking on the brush
I haven't sprayed the brush or anything
it's just how it's coming off so just
keep that in mind we do use my finger
see how that works
I'm gonna go back in with the brush that
we use with the green not the clean one
and blend out the edges of that I'm not
super impressed with that middle shade I
feel like it's pretty for the price that
you pay but I'm not super obsessed with
it so I'm going to go into this other
palette real quick and take the lighter
shade and put it right in the center and
see if that just helps make the look pop
take this a Mac 242 this one's not as
chunky it's definitely more powdery and
then we'll just put that right in the
center yeah that one's way better the
lighter shades and this one so far way
way better I'm actually gonna mix this
shade and this shade just to kind of get
that lighter tone but a little bit more
of amber because it is more warm and I'm
just going to very lightly go into that
crease and blend out the edge of that
green nothing too crazy we're just very
lightly going in there so see it just
gives it more of a faded look I'm barely
touching my eye while I'm doing this so
far so good and we don't have like a
outer v sharp line or anything so it's
just gonna be a nice kind of rounded
smoky eye which I'm really enjoying so
next up we have something I'm super
excited about it's a matte liquid light
so it looks like I'm use cosmetics
okay guys so sorry about that I know my
mic went out at some point
I'm not sure when what I was saying is I
was using this matte liquid liner is
nice and matte black as you guys can see
it does have a little bit of a sheen to
it but it's not too crazy I mean for a
dollar it's not bad at all so I don't
have any lashes for this video so I'm
just gonna go ahead and apply these
off-camera and then I'll be right back
and we will move on to the face so as I
was putting on my lashes I was going
through my tweets and seeing all of you
wearing the Palladio collab and like
buying them I'm so excited thank you
guys so much for your support just a
quick little like mention about it I'm
so glad you're enjoying them as much as
I love that thank you so so much
I love seeing your photos we're gonna
move on to foundation and concealer
first off I did get the new sponge too I
just get this dirty no this is so soft
and bouncy it's the AOA studio Wonder
Blender got two of them cuz if I loved
it all under another one basically it
says it's a latex free high definition
cosmetic sponge designed for easy
application and blending use of primers
foundations powders cream blushes and
other complexion products unique design
is great for large areas of the face and
hard-to-reach areas it literally feels
even softer than a Beauty Blender like
it's very squishy and nice so I believe
these were 2 dollars apiece I think this
is one of the ones that were a little
bit more expensive primer I got the AOA
skin wonder skin mattifying primer
excited to test this one out this kinda
reminds me of NYX that's what it is I
was looking at this like what does this
remind me of and it definitely reminds
me of NYX packaging just looks like this
and I'm gonna put this in the areas
where I get oily I'm gonna rub it
between my fingers and just put this
here in my t-zone I'm not really gonna
worry about the outer parts of my face
because I'm not oily here I'm oily in my
t-zone so that's where I want to focus
this primer for foundation today I have
this one from amused cosmetics it's the
matte finish foundation it just looks
like this it's kind of cute this shades
definitely be more for me this one's too
lightest ones in KL 1 5 8 mix in 5 I
don't know if that helps you but that's
the color I got so what it says here on
the back I'm guessing that's the shade
name I think this might be a little
light for me we will see when we put it
on but I am gonna apply it with a sponge
primer is ready to go it's really nice
move I have a feeling it's gonna be it's
gonna be good cross our fingers Oh II
might have to use a brush because the
way that just like dotted on my skin
from this was kind of interesting so I'm
gonna do once I was a sponsor inside
with a brush and just see what's better
might be also that this sponge is
soaking up a lot of product but we're
definitely not getting a full coverage
here so that side is with a sponge I'm
gonna try to build it up right here
because I have a lot of red pigment
peeking through from my rosacea the
color is actually not bad it's
definitely more of a medium coverage
foundation in my opinion yeah you could
still see some redness peeking through
some freckles over here you guys know I
love full coverage but we're gonna see
how it looks with a brush kind of feels
cooling on the skin too alright feel
like you get the same coverage either
way with a sponge or a brush either way
it's gonna be a medium coverage product
so I'm going to go ahead and apply this
all over already put out a lot on my
back of my hand
and I'm having to apply more this is
what it looks like just a medium
coverage nothing crazy and I look very
shiny so for a matte finish foundation I
would not expect me looking like a
greaseball after just applying it
definitely have to set it with powder
but I'm gonna go ahead and put on some
concealer which I did get a concealer
this looks pretty dark but it's in the
shade light ivory this doesn't look like
a light ivory this one's the AOA studio
wonder cover HD concealer there's not
ivory okay so we're gonna put this on it
actually looks a little bit orange like
it has a really intense peach color to
it so I'm hoping this doesn't look crazy
under here but right now it looks like
it has a lot of coverage like just
applying this I'm gonna go ahead and
blend out one eye first
might be a good correcting concealer but
not necessarily all over your skin
it's very peachy and dark so if you are
more fair than I am even if you're just
a little bit lighter than what I am this
is probably not gonna work for you it is
pretty dark unless you use it as a
corrector but it does have really great
coverage I mean look at that I just need
to brighten it up I'm actually gonna
take this YSL
tsch concealer the two shook lot and
just put this a little bit over the
outer part I'm just gonna try to
highlight with that and it looks a
little weird so I think mixing that
concealer with a lighter one would be
better for me but it does look very
peachy orange but I can't get over the
coverage like the coverage is really
nice and it's not like really
accentuating pores concealer makes all
the difference see this is what I'm
talking about when you go in and you're
like nervous about your smoky eye I'm
like wait until you get your face makeup
on and then decide if you love it or
hate it actually don't hate this
concealer for correcting dark circles
it's pretty good but I am gonna use my
wife someone just to highlight the rest
of my face because I don't want to use
that peachy color to do so so I'm just
gonna use it to highlight it's a really
lightweight concealer now what we're
gonna do is going with this
AO a studio perfect setting powder so
that's what that looks like this one is
a banana shade it's called banana so
we're gonna use this one today you guys
know I love my banana powders makeup
revolution has a really great one
they're lace baking powder and banana is
like one my favorites so I've got some
on my lid I'm gonna take my sponge this
looks pretty dark and we're gonna set oh
it's super dark just set the end right
oh my god it's turning orange do you see
that you've got to be kidding me
look at this that's it won't blend out
that just went orange on my skin I
cannot go out the house looking like
that that is probably the worst powder
I've tried a long time that's going
straight into the trash I'm gonna see if
I can fix it with this Milani banana
powder
so I am easing the Milani loose powder
believe this is in the shade banana yeah
I translucent banana okay so I'm gonna
go into this essence brighten that
powder and just try to brighten up my
undereyes really quick yeah you see the
difference with a little bit of that
sounds like a little bit of a lighter
Sheen okay alright alright we're back in
business here moving on I don't have a
bronzer so I'm just gonna go ahead and
bronze and contour and then I do have
like blushes and highlighter I thought
they're definitely delicious
okay so I'm surprised I think in a
bronzer it's not like me so muscle I've
seen it okay so now we're gonna move on
to blush and highlighter so I have two
different blushes here we have this one
that is more mob taupe very pretty and
these two do have little highlighters
that go with them here's the color of
this one very pretty this is kind of
like my kind of color and really like
this color as well this one is number
two it's definitely this dark it looks
pretty light when I put it up to the
camera I think that's cuz the lights but
this is definitely a true to color and
then I also have this starry triple
blush palette you guys know I like blush
but I guess I got a lot of them and then
the AOA Wonder baked highlighter so this
one is in cupcake just swatch that so it
feels really dry yeah that's no these
remind me of those elf baked
highlighters yeah just just save your
money on that oh here are the three
shades they're really pretty there are
two very vibrant ones and then more of a
lighter pink oh these are pigmented
pigmented Wow they kind of feel oh I
kind of feel chalky I think these could
be pretty so that's what they look like
also use this lighter shade to mix in
with these two to kind of lighten them
up a little bit so I'm definitely gonna
try this out and let you guys know what
I think I'm gonna first start out with
this one this is the blush and glow one
that does not have a name
really but that's what it looks like
that's just my kind of color so we're
gonna use that one today I mean just use
my Sigma brush that I finally found oh
that's a pretty color very pretty like
everyday blush are gonna use the
highlighter in the palette as well
ooh this looks good this is definitely
different than that baked one I just
watched okay that's pretty it's a little
darker than what I like but it does look
really good with the blush I like more
of a super intense highlighter but it is
pretty kind of looks a little gray on my
skin when I'm looking straight forward
oh yeah Wow
so this is a highlighter from this blush
palette and they're just like really
brighten that up when I obsessed with
the highlighter that it's in this blush
kit but that's why I got this one so I'd
have a lighter one just in case this one
was too dark for me I'm gonna go in with
this AOA Studio Wonder brow tinted brow
pomade I haven't used a brow pomade in a
while so you'll see how I like this this
is a really tiny little jar at the shade
taupe so that's what it looks like it is
so small I would lose this and then
that's what it looks like it's literally
just product in here which I can
appreciate even though I've been using
pencils lately I have nothing against
pomades they're so easy to use and if I
need like a quick brow a pomade usually
the way for me to go okay I think this
is a really really creamy product a
little too light for me but it's not
terrible for a doll
you know like these products are a
dollar you can't be too harsh on them
but if filled in my brow looks nice and
fluffy it looks like more natural I
would say I also have this go brow fiber
gel that I got in the shade taupe as
well so that's what it looks like you
guys know I love things like this to
kind of lighten up the brow this has
fibers in it so that's cool it's gonna
make your brows a little bit thicker I
definitely think that just helped out
quite a bit
still need to take a pencil in the inner
corner but that just really completed
that brow now we're gonna go in with the
amuse Cosmetics liquid lipstick in lip
two-one-zero 0-3 so it just looks like
this I like the packaging it reminds me
a lot of the Mac liquid lipsticks and it
has a regular dosa applicator this is
matching my shirt perfectly ok guys so
this is the complete and makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
there were quite a bit of hits and
misses in here so I'm just gonna quickly
talk about my hits I really did like
these blush palettes I thought they were
great as well as the eyeshadow palettes
I think you're gonna have some that are
hit and that are a Miss but so far the
eye look that I came up with I'm really
enjoying these two just to add some
color and some shine to the eye so this
liquid lip isn't terrible it has a lot
of pigment this is one of those liquid
lips that drives down but it drives down
kind of sticky so just keep that in mind
when you get this as concealer wasn't
terrible coverage wise but color wise it
was completely off for a light ivory
shade it did end up working out somehow
those are my favorites from the video
everything else is kind of like a Miss
not my favorite I'm not obsessed with
the foundation now I'm just with a
powder at all then with the brow product
it's okay but it's nothing too crazy but
it is good for a dollar so if you guys
wanna check out everything that I
mentioned I will leave them all down
below in the description box oh I also
really like the sponge so far I thought
this was really nice to work with so let
me know down below if you've ever
shopped on this website before and what
your favorite products are and I'll
definitely go check them out and maybe
do it part two if you guys are
interested and thank you again so much
for watching and I will see you all in
my next video
I think that I'm going to
some pop by a gate star baby they never
gonna find me
