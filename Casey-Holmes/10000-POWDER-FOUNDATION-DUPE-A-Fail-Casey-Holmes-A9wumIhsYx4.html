know my eyes are like boom BAM intense
smoky but you know that's just my that's
my thing I love it but the only thing
I'm wearing super dramatic lashes like
literally they're so thick I could fly
away with them so uhm yeah I don't know
they go with the look because the look
is so dramatic but let me know if you
guys wanna see this is really really
intense and like after I finished my
foundation and stuff I plan on putting
this on top of my lips so it's gonna be
so dramatic today we're gonna try to
find a dupe before the la prairie powder
foundation you guys know I love this I
did a first impression on it it was like
a four hundred dollar products tested
video and it was only like three parter
because in there i love this part of
foundation I keep one in my purse I use
this for touch-ups if I'm wearing
sunglasses and I get like those sunglass
marks you know this I use to just take
my finger and Pat it in there oh sorry
so I use this to touch that up I've used
this all over my face for like a date
night so I'm going to do one side of my
face with this la Prairie foundation and
another side with a new powder
foundation and I'm really excited to try
this one out and also got one from Tarte
but I'm a little more excited to try
this out because when I was in store I
was feeling it with my fingers and it
just felt so nice on the skin and I felt
like it was going to look beautiful so
the color I got is in sand and this says
it's a long wearing to baked formula
with active mesh technology it delivers
a weightless breath of oh but--can I
read delivers a weightless breathable
finish applied dry for medium to
buildable coverage apply wet for a more
impactful finish wet
I like applying powder foundations dry
but I made you want to go upside bucks
and do it wet feel free I believe you
could apply this wet too but I I like to
just build it up you know what I'm
saying so we're going to do today now
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to prime since I've been using the
law Prairie foundation I know what I
like to do and I like to prime and then
conceal first and then put powder
foundation on top so going to use my
Canon Austin primer this is the
mattifying primer okay the next step
we're going to use a concealer and the
one I'm going to use today is from
Smashbox where's it at here it
so for concealer I'm going to using
these Smashbox Studios game 24-hour
concealer and I like this because it's
really lightweight but it gives good
coverage it's like medium to buildable
and I just love it I think it looks
great with powder on top so I'm going to
apply this under my eyes this is just
the way I like to apply my powder
foundations with the concealer down
first and then that on top because cream
on top of powder is not cute most of the
time almost every time for me this way I
can cover my dark circles and a little
bit of redness and then I don't have to
use as much powder foundation I want to
start off with the Laura Geller one
because I'm just really excited about it
the double take baked versatile part of
foundation and sand and I forget how
much it is but I will leave it right
here and this is an 18-month product so
that's a long time for it not to expire
and there is 0.35 ounces in this and
then in the law prior y1o la Pretoria
one is 24 months and there's 14 point no
oh okay
and there's point 50 ounces in the law
Prairie ones so there's more in this one
it's more expensive so be happy that
there's more in this with price
difference could be a game-changer if
this works out and then it says for the
sponge applicator the white side is what
application the pink side is dry
application so we're going to be using
the pink side today again this is what
it looks like so I'm just going to go in
with it with this pink side and for this
pad foundation I'm going to use it on
the right side of my face and yes I'm
breaking out over here I don't know
what's going on holy that does not
look like the same product oh I know I
mean I could try to blend it out but
o M G let's see what it looks like with
a flat top brush maybe since we have
more control I do not like the color of
this I guess we're going to try the
Tarte one now because this does not this
is not going to work while I wait for
that makeup remover to dry I'm going to
go in with the natural beige from
lottery and I'm going to do this side of
my face all I do is I just take the puff
go in here and then just go down my face
see how much easier that was to apply oh
my god oh this powder foundation is
literally so good the way this la
Prairie won just applied like even
touching the sponge to my face was so
much different than the Laura Geller one
yo I was so excited about that laura
geller one though
moving on so now I'm going to try to
chart high-performance Naturals
confidence creamy powder foundation I
got two shades we have medium tan honey
and tan honey so since that last color
war Geller did not work out I'm going to
check these colors and see which one I
think is best
now inside you do get this little pouch
and it says make today beautiful and
then you pull out a product and you have
a puff then you have the powder
foundation so this one's medium tan
honey which looks pretty good over here
and then this one is tan honey I think
this one's the darker shade it could be
wrong oh yeah we're going with this one
so again this one's in the shade medium
tan honey looks like it's going to be
better point three nine ounces so that's
even a little bit more than the laura
geller one and this lasts for 12 months
so that is a whole year less than the la
Prairie powder foundation if that
matters to you there's one side with a
nice like velvety purple I don't know
purple side and then there's a sponge
side where Israeli directions
I missing something I don't know what
the difference is one side this one
feels good this feels kind of like the
law priority sponge and then this just
feels like a regular sponge so I'm going
to use this side because I feel like
this side the purple side you guys can't
really tell there it is there's like a
hint of pork roll and then there's the
black I think this side is going to be
present powder foundation or cheeses
please be okay
a little bit darker but we'll just have
to bronze a la prairie side the sponge
feels really good it feels really oh god
these colors what did I do I get really
tan when I was going to shop for these
like what the hell the same kind of
finish as la Prairie but I feel like la
Prairie is a little bit more fine and
covers a little bit better to the point
that I don't have to keep going in over
and over to cover certain areas okay so
there's a - on the skin they both look
really nice and smooth a la Prairie mom
would cover these blemishes a little
more I know because I've used it with
blemishes another thing I don't like is
you cannot put the sponge in here and
close it so you're gonna have to keep
track of the sponge I'm going to go
ahead and bronze this side of my face
and even out this color situation going
on but so far so good they both feel
really good on the skin they actually
feel the exact same but yeah let me
finish my makeup and I'll be back to
give you guys another update okay so
first off I would like to say I'm loving
this makeup look and how dramatic and
fall it is it has just given me life and
the choker and the shirt is just gonna
be like but I want you to come back on
and share with you guys what I'm
thinking about the two foundations and
even looking at it up close I was doing
my eyeliner and things like that and I
had my mirror like right to my face
there's not a difference with the
texture there's not a difference with
the way it looks on the skin they
actually look very identical so that's a
plus hopefully they both wear the same
but so far so good
Tarte one covered amazingly and it looks
really great next to the la Prairie one
obviously the color was a little bit off
but I tried to help it I try to fix it
hopefully you can't tell too much it's
gonna go throughout the day see how
these wear and I'll be
to give you guys an update in a few
hours hey guys so I'm back it is
actually around 1122 you could see right
there and I didn't show the time earlier
and I totally forgot but it was around
3:30 4 o'clock and I've had this on ever
since both of these foundations and
honestly they look pretty much the same
I look a little bit oily on my forehead
I have blood once at a toll process and
that's it I mean but the main focus is
like literally these look so similar
when I was talking to David on the phone
he said he liked this one a little bit
better because it looked more natural
and this one looked like it had powder
you know I'm saying but me I don't think
they look any different I think they
both look beautiful I really like them
both I think the only thing that's
different is the Tarte one you do have
to kind of build it up a little bit to
get full coverage and the locker you
want it's like one swipe done but I mean
for the price difference it's no big
deal just to build it up a little bit
more and get this coverage I really
really like it I think it feels the
exact same it wears the exact same and I
really like it so far so I'm excited to
keep using it but so far I do think it
is an alternative I'm in my pajamas
because I tried on so many different
outfits for New York because I leave
tomorrow and I'm really excited so I've
just been trying stuff on trying to get
things ready and I was like oh crap I
gotta fill my update so yes I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and I will see you all
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
