feedback from my mascara likes and
dislikes video and a lot of you were
saying that I should make it like kind
of a little series and I totally agree i
think it was so much fun i love do i
love doing the mascara likes and
dislikes video so I was like yeah I will
so be down for doing more stuff so if
you follow me on twitter facebook and a
lot of times facebook knows things first
so you should really follow me on there
but you know that my next one was going
to be eyeliners and i'm really excited
because I love my liners I love trying
out new ones but I do have some drug
store in here for you guys to see that I
did purchase and wanted to try out for
you guys so don't take offense to it
I've repeated this in my last video I'm
not saying this stuff is crap I'm just
saying that like the dislikes are things
I wouldn't repurchase I kind of have my
maybes and my likes are things that I
would repurchase or have you purchased
quite a few times so don't take offense
to anything if I don't like what you
like we all have different opinions
taste eyelids preferences all of that so
don't take offense it's just my opinion
so on to it first one is a high-end
eyeliner and it's a crayon liner and
it's the essay lauder double wear one I
don't know if I'm going to do this and
every with every line are trying to
focus it up close but it's a very black
liner like for your waterline that's
intense and it doesn't take pressure
like a lot of pressure to get that color
payoff but this stuff runs so so so bad
like this is more of I feel like a
smudging liner like if you want that
smudge look I don't like this it runs so
bad like right here and over here it
just really gets underneath my lash line
I'm not a huge fan and I definitely
wouldn't repurchase that next is this
Revlon Colorstay little I pin thing this
is a felt tip liner and don't get me
wrong I love my felt tips and it does
have really good color payoff but once I
apply it to my lids it's really hard to
work with because this felt tip does not
wear down at all so it's just harder to
work with I like it my felt tips go down
and personally for me this doesn't stay
on as well as I wish it would I have
better liars in here that do so I
repurchase this one next is another
revlon colorstay this is actually the
crayon liner the retractable one and I
like that the color stays on my
waterline and actually is pretty nice i
do like this but I broke the little tip
of it off like not even a lot it was
just like the very tip that comes out
and it won't retract up or we track down
it's just like suck I don't know if I
got a bad one or whatever but I don't
even know if I may purchase it to try it
again because i'm just so picky like I
don't know stuff like that fits a bad
taste in my mouth and I really don't
want to try another one but I don't know
we'll have to see like I said I do like
it it's probably the best cry on
drugstore liner you know for your
waterline and stuff but i don't know
maybe I were purchased it not too sure
next is this physicians formula i define
a felt tip I marker you guys know I have
a serious love-hate relationship with
physicians formula like it's hard to
find something that me and physicians
formula like together like I just
doesn't work but this is what that looks
like very cheaply packaging but i'm
going to swatch this for you it's I
don't know you guys can't really see it
but you really have to build up the
color to get a really black line
especially when you're on your water lot
or on your own Lynn it's really hard to
work with you just really have to build
up the color to get it how you want it
um I don't wanna have to go over my
liner on my lids three thousand times to
get the way I want it and all that dress
so I'm not a huge fan I'm definitely
going to use it all this stuff I do use
or I pass down to my mom or something
but I wouldn't repurchase it again
especially for the full price all right
we're getting into the maybes that was a
maybe this one's a maybe if the L'Oreal
hip high intensity pigments I like the
color payoff on this I like the color
payoff all my mine water line but this
is a really really rough drugstore
crayon liner like it's really rough on
my eyes and I don't like really rough
stuff on my waterline
hurts even when I try to warm it up it's
still hard to you have to really work
with it to get the color on your
waterline but once you do you're good to
go but I'm definitely going to use this
up it doesn't run on the corners of my
eyes or anything like that so it's a
good liner but i have my favorites next
is a maybe I know I used to talk about
the stuff a lot it's the elf liquid
liner and the reason why i don't really
like it anymore is because the brush is
so big on it granted amazing color
payoff if i need a dollar liner like I
don't have three dollars to spend on my
favorite liner yeah I'm gonna pick this
up and use it to I get three dollars to
buy my favorite liner but I don't reach
for this anymore as much as they used to
um and the longer brush it is kind of
harder to work with you have to get used
to but with any liquid liner you really
have to get used to any of them but this
does have pretty good staying power like
i said i have my favorites and I know
what I'd want to repurchase and I
wouldn't go strictly to target for this
product I would get my favorite liner
next is going into my likes these are my
really really likes I do love them I
love the elf waterproof eyeliner pen I
know some people get really bad ones the
felt tip really does wear down nicely
and it has awesome color payoff this is
it right there right there I love it
some people get really dried out once I
forget i'm pretty pretty pretty sure i
get mine online i think if you get them
in stores are more dried out i love this
stuff it's lasted me for forever
literally like this little one has left
me forever I've never had one dry out on
me anything like that it's super easy to
apply I love this and it's only dollar I
next are my two favorite drugstore
liquid liners I love them swear I them
use them for months it's the NYC liquid
liner I think this is about three
dollars and this is what it looks like
on the top one was their old packaging
and the bottom one is their new actually
like their new packaging a lot better
it's a lot more sleek they both are the
same the this one you have to use to the
applicator because it is so so long but
the brush is really really tiny so it's
really easy to work with easy to get
right in there and make your wings liner
or get right there in your tear duct
it's an amazing amazing line these have
actually lasts me quite a while so I
can't swear by it enough to you I think
you should definitely definitely try
them out next is something i got i know
i haven't done a Victoria's Secret CVS
haul like I said I would or I asked you
guys if I shouldn't you all were like
yeah yeah yeah I just have a whole bunch
of other videos I have to do and a mini
haul wasn't one of them so I did get
this in my little bit Tories secret
eyeshadow palettes actually got to one
of them you'll see in a favorites video
and the other one I'll probably show you
in there too um but this is a liner that
came with them so I got two liners since
I've got two pallets and this is just
their regular black liner and I
absolutely love it you see how pigmented
that is so amazing so easy to apply to
your eye it doesn't hurt or scratch your
waterline anything like that it stays on
doesn't run I love it I love it I love
it if I were to run out of this stuff i
would definitely a hundred percent
repurchase this because i think it's
amazing okay so the next one is for mac
and this is my mac smolder liner or I
coal and smolder it's really little I've
had it for forever it's lasted me
literally forever and I absolutely love
it to me it's super super pigmented and
that's it right there it's so pigmented
it doesn't run on me I know a lot of
people have said that the max smolder
liner does run on them I think it's just
like I said personal preference um
depends on your eyes and like mine gets
super watery but for some reason this
one doesn't smudge at all I've mentioned
it I think in a favorites video if not I
should have but it's super tiny I love
it i experiment with so many liners but
I will definitely repurchase this
because I think it's totally worth the
money next is my last of high-end 100 I
lied but this is my last high-end crayon
liner and you can't even tell what it is
right it's like a baby this is actually
the Makeup Forever aqua eyes black
crayon liner
especially for the summertime whenever
you're sweating and you haven't like
really bad I problems like all your
makeup is just running this stuff is
amazing I used it all last summer
absolutely loved it of course I'm down
to the brim this does have really great
color payoff as well that's it right
there I don't have a sephora near me as
most of you know so I I don't know I
like to order online but when i order
online I end up ordering things that I
want to get going in store like
foundations and stuff so I end up not
ordering online and wanting to go in the
store and I just never go so that's why
i haven't repurchased another one of
these but seriously all-time favorite
high-end waterproof liner so last liquid
liner is also high end and this is kat
von d's liquid liner i had this all last
summer um I don't know if they sell it
anymore which is why I was kind of
hesitant to show you guys but I swear by
this stuff if I ever see this again this
will be the only liner i use um and i
know it six but i think it's like
seventeen dollars it's not too bad but
this is what looks like it has the
perfect size applicator the perfect
brush and it is so black so freaking
black i absolutely love this liner i
just love it i haven't been using it
much lately because i tried to save it
and baby it because i don't want to go
away but i'm pretty sure it's not sold
anymore if it is let me know down below
i would love to know and love to know
where to get it but yeah Kat Von D's
liner and black is just the plain black
no Sparkle shimmer or anything like that
so I love it it's the autograph liner
okay last but not least is gel liners
and I kind of have a tiff in this one so
I have a Revlon one and I have max black
track going to talk about max black
truck real quick this is what it looks
like to share plain old gel liner
absolutely love it is so freaking black
and easy easy to work with by the way if
you're wondering for black let me moving
the camera sorry for black liners I
actually use this Sedona lace ET 19
which is a nice angle brush and it's
super easy to apply this with I mean
it's just the bomb so i right
in black Chuck and as you guys know in
my hall I did not too long ago I did get
the revlon colorstay one I do like this
one I think it's really great it is hard
to work with if you mess up you better
hurry up and try to fix it because it
dries so quickly and it's just hard to
work with um but just like that little
jar and this also comes with like a
little portable brush which i think is
great if you just kind of want to toss
this in your purse you have a little
brush to take with you instead of taking
like nice ones or something like that
but here's my thing so this Revlon one
is I'm pretty sure it was like 1399 it
was something along those lines are very
expensive definitely over ten dollars
the black track is fifteen dollars now
the black track has three grams in it
and the Revlon one has 2.3 grams so much
more product in the mac one than there
is in the Revlon one let's just let's
just take a look I just think if you are
thinking of purchasing the Revlon
Colorstay one if they still have I don't
know you just need to go by max black
track because it is amazing it's easier
to work with and it's so freakin black
like I absolutely love it I swear by and
this sexual ask me for forever a lot of
people I think of said there's a dried
out not sure mine's not dried out I've
had it for almost a year and you can see
it's still got that like nice shiny
texture to it so again I hope this is
helpful like this video if you're still
interested in seeing some more likes and
dislikes and i will see you on my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
