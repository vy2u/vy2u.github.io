my face per usual I do want to say don't
mind my lip I didn't get socked in the
mouth I didn't get my lips touched up so
pretty bruised and swollen right now so
it's just bear with me I wanted to do a
true first impression on this product I
should probably wait for a wear test but
I really want to just go ahead and try
it getting my first impression I was
going to do a wear test on this it
caused my exponents but I want to film
another video after this and there's a
reason why I'm not going to use this and
you'll see that in a wear test I wanted
to test this out now this is a pretty
hefty price foundation it's a hundred
and twenty dollars which is insane they
have one two three four five shades
which really sucks they have more just
lighter to medium colors more medium it
looks like so those are the shade ranges
right there you get one point one ounce
and it is SPF 23 so you get minus a
Neiman Marcus hopefully this color
matches me
I don't even though I can't even keep up
with self tanner anymore hopefully I
looked on other sites and it had
actually really good reviews so we're
going to see how it works on my skin and
the main factor of this is like it's 120
dollars okay we all know I love my Sonia
Kashuk one that's like 15 my wet and
wild one which is like six so that's
very good okay they're really good so
I'm going to go ahead and prime my face
with my regular primers I have my
Smashbox primer water right here you can
see almost out
and in my canon austin magazine primers
you're wondering what that glitter is it
is this Tila diamond dust when is it the
magnificent metals glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadow got it is I did not
have to type this on at all I know you
guys have probably been seeing this
everywhere but there's a reason why and
it's because it's beautiful and I will
say the glitter is kind of falling out
on my face right now so we're going to
see how that wears too I guess
throughout the day seems like it's
everywhere but so far I'm in love with
it and I love this color diamond dust
just because I feel like will go with
any kind of eye shadow look this is 1.1
ounces it isn't like a squeezy tube I
have this shade 0:20 and this is what it
looks like honestly it doesn't look like
one fluid ounce or a little over because
it's such a tiny little bottle that's of
color maybe this'll match we'll see and
then today I'm going to use my
lore'l sponge because you guys know I've
been loving it so I for $120 I want this
foundation to cover up all of my rosacea
I wanted to make me look poreless and
flawless so we'll see
it seems pretty thick get dog hair
whoa okay okay it does have a fit to it
I feel like just a floral set I think we
should try one side with a Beauty
Blender and then one side with brush
this was Matt there's like no shine
coming off of this on the product
definitely a thick foundation little
thicker than I thought it would be
honestly because I don't really find a
lot of super high-end makeup like
foundations to be really thick like this
this is thicker wow look at coverage I
mean I had to put a limit on this side
because it has so much on my buns if you
have just a little bit left so I'm going
to add a little bit more we're knees a
brush so let's see what brush I want to
use so I'm going to use this it caused
medet CC skin perfecting brush and we're
going to blend it out on this side see
how well it runs out but I don't think
I'm feeling it with a brush I'm just not
really a brush person you guys I don't
know what it is seems like a little bit
less covering it sorry I'm going back to
the sponges I can't I don't like verses
very much so this is a matte foundation
it's not really making my pores look
amazing or the texture on my skin to be
honest with you he's going to get this
all over get any excess product now
don't get me wrong I have very lowly
skin I love a matte foundation so
hopefully it doesn't look too drawing
after powder and now I'm going to do is
I'm going to go with my regular
concealer and set my face with the Kodi
airspun loose powder I go back and forth
with this product and my flower beauty
powder all of the fashion week I was
using this powder I really liked it
I'm gonna let this bake and I'm going to
finish my eyebrows and the rest of my
face I'm going to come back and give you
guys a little update and then we going
to go ahead and wear it's about a day in
the back okay guys so if have my makeup
done for like an hour now I just needed
a break because I think I have allergies
I think that's what's going on and my
eyes are getting so watery the lights
are becoming like too much for me so I
had to take a break Aylin ate some food
and came back so this looks foundation
is looking like right now I like it but
I do think it is just a little too heavy
for me I don't have any diffusers though
I like so you guys see everything you
see pores you texture you can see a lot
of what's going on with the skin you can
see a lot of it right here I have a
little bit of texture but my pores are
actually not showing up super intense
like right in here is usually where I
have an issue and they don't look bad
whatsoever and I even have highlighter
all the way up to the top so it needs
life it looks a lot more intense but
when I go out into like my house and
just look at myself out there and the
mirror is out there my bathroom it looks
a lot better because I don't have such
harsh light like going onto my skin so
far so good on the skin it is a little
bit heavy but I think it's gonna be fine
it is a matte finish if you have dry
skin you are not going to like this I
believe because it is like a dry matte I
haven't tried a dry matte foundation in
a while usually I go for more of like a
satin matte so this is a new one for me
for a while but I will definitely test
it out for you and for list I'm wearing
the Urban Decay vice liquid lipstick I'm
obsessed with this this is in the shade
and naked I really like these liquid
lipsticks because they're really
lightweight and they don't feel dry on
the list at all right now is 324 I'm
going to go ahead and wear this
throughout the day I hope keep you guys
updated and I will see you in my next
clip hi guys so I'm back we're getting a
little bit of a hot mess I took my
lashes off because my lashes were
irritating me really really bad oh my
gosh it looks so awful on camera does it
realize you guys okay so let's just do
some updates real quick first off and so
what the foundation is looking like
after quite a few hours right now it is
1024 I'm honestly really exhausted I'm
like an old lady lately I just like want
to go to bed early so bad now in Vegas
but anyways
earlier and it's shopping and things and
I got some stuff I'll show you
excuse me Stacy has her head in Sephora
and she's my dog
I wish shopping at Sephora for some
throwbacks throw down products and I
ended up behind a lot so I went out to
you know buy that stuff and just run
some errands and I only bought it once
in store which was about maybe about
6:30 and I haven't touched my face with
any powder all day today so I'm going to
take some tissue I would normally use my
blogging sheets from Pilate oh and blot
my face with that but I don't have those
up here with me when I was looking at
myself in the mirror when I was out it
actually looks pretty good I think like
it didn't look terrible you know I mean
I definitely got a little bit oily
throughout the end of the night I'm
sorry I'm sniffling and stuff I'm
getting sick okay sighs France based on
my memory card had to go downstairs and
I watched over some of this footage and
from the beginning and now and you can
have a conclusion on the foundation when
I was out and stuff it did look okay
obviously it looked like a hack
nomination on so it wasn't as smooth as
my like Sonia Kashuk won or my wet and
wild foundation like this foundation is
just too heavy for me and for the 120
dollar priced at me I don't think it's
worth it and I think if you have normal
to dry skin you might not like either
just because it is so drying does
accentuate you know texture if you have
that it didn't really accentuate my
pores too much I think it's just more
the texture that I have from the rosacea
mmm I'm gonna go in oh I'm sorry yeah I
just didn't work out for me it's not the
kind of foundation I like to go for I
think it's just too drying and it just
it's a little too cake face for me
believe it or not it's a little too
Gatorade for me that is my conclusion on
foundation I think you guys can see it
for yourselves how it looks on the skin
and I just wasn't impressed by it so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video please
give a thumbs up if you did like it and
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
