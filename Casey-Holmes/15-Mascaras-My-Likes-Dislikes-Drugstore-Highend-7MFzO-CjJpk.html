when I scare favorites and dislikes so I
actually have 15 mascaras I wanted to
show you guys for this likes and
dislikes so I'm gonna go ahead and get
started and also if mascara that you
like is in here you know don't take
offence if I say I don't like it or
something like that it's just my
personal opinion well it didn't work for
me
I'm not calling this stuff crap and I'm
not saying I hate it but this basically
what I would repurchase it when I
wouldn't repurchase and then kind of in
the middle of I don't know if I would or
what in or whatever so I'm gonna go
ahead and get started the first two that
I more likely would not repurchase is
the Revlon grow luscious line I had high
hopes for these and then they just kind
of fell to bits and by the way every
single mascara has a sticky nut on it
because I've been playing this video out
and I really wanted to make sure I tried
out all my mascaras and told you guys
what I really really didn't like even
though I kind of already knew what I
didn't like about certain ones but let's
go back on this one this is the plumping
mascara it says doesn't do much of
anything to my lashes the wand is
nothing special which it really isn't
it's just basically like your basic wand
and it's actually huge it's pretty much
the size of my eyeball can you see that
pretty much oversized mascara I feel
like and I don't know and then this one
is by fabulous and I said maybe if it
had a curved wand it'd be better no
volume and not very black and this is
what this one looks like a shy freaking
normos wand ginormous again as big as my
eyeball but umm basically both of these
I kind of have the same opinion about
they don't do anything for my lashes
when I put this on I kind of just feel
like my natural lashes have um mascara
on them like product on them it doesn't
feel like it lifts them makes them
thicker even puts any volume in it it
feels like it just coats product all my
lashes but when I wear mascara I will my
lashes to be like BAM like Hello I got
my scare on like I don't want it to look
natural at all so because that kind of
defeats the purpose for me I feel like
so I don't like these two at all there
not a fan I'm not a fan of them and the
next one is a high-end actually only
have two high-end products in here
because I'm not really huge on buying
high-end mascaras but there is one I
will be purchasing so this is actually
the benefit back at lash now what I
wrote on this one was it's not worth
purchasing it does what a drugstore
mascara does so basically this is what
the wand looks like again a huge wand I
just I don't know I feel like I could
find a mascara in the drugstore which
I've actually tried that could pretty
much be a dupe for this and it just
doesn't do what I feel like it would do
it I just I don't know I had high hopes
for it and it just wasn't you know my
favorite at all I would not repurchase
this especially for the full price I
like before and making a mess but like
so4 or something I would not purchase
that at all that's just my opinion okay
so next are like my maybes maybe I weary
purchased if I have to so the first one
is this boots number seven maximum
volume volume maximum such a creative
name right so it's from that number
seven client Klein line that you could
get in Target all right whatever it is
this one on this one is it's alright
more of a layering mascara it doesn't do
much on its own again I feel like my
favorites could pretty much cover this
mascara I feel like this was just kind
of like a waste it's okay I mean it's
not like the worst but it's just not
something I'd want to repurchase again
it just doesn't I don't know it's
nothing special so I don't really
recommend the boots number 7 volume or
maximum volume mascara next is the
colossal now I will say this I put love
in for volume pretty good at separating
lashes horrible smell absolutely hate
the smell I remember I purchased this
because I couldn't find the one by one
mascara a while back and it purchased
this and it's pretty good I mean it
makes your lashes thick have volume and
separates them pretty well so it's a
decent mascara but I just don't think I
think the smell is just way too powerful
and I just can't do it I don't know it's
just so much I mean just so much smell
like I can smell it right now it's just
smelling at my whole vanity area but I
don't know if I would repurchase it
again that is my second one but now that
I've discovered numerous Kara's and ones
that I really love I don't think I would
repurchase that again next is the Loreal
the L'Oreal voluminous carbon black
mascara you know a lot of you love the
voluminous line I hate the voluminous
million lashes I'll tell you right now
hate that mascara I don't hate this I
would probably repurchase it again by
AXA lutely I don't know me and the
voluminous line we just kind of don't
get along
but I said berry black I feel like I
have to combine it with something else
to get great volume it is super super
black I do like that about this mascara
it kind of gets really clumpy if you're
not careful like your lashes will start
to get really clumpy if you use it too
many times but of course you could go in
with a different mascara and separate
your lashes if you wanted to but I don't
know there's just nothing truly like
special to me about this so I would have
to say this would be a maybe I don't
know this is one I probably wouldn't
purchase again at all it's the mega
plush volume express mascara I said it's
alright eyelashes aren't crunchy we know
how your eyelashes can feel like we
really really crunchy and stuff but I
said it's nothing special I don't
understand this concept right here I
actually really don't like that I just
feel like I can't really get down to the
root and really put a lot of product on
my lashes because it been so much and it
doesn't want to put as much product on
as it would if it was just a straight
one and this is just one of those ice
scares or I've had people tell me they
loved it and people tell me they hated
it so definitely personal preference on
this one as well now these are all
mascaras that I love so I'm gonna go
ahead and start with this one it's the
Maybelline the turbo volume Express I
feel like this is just a staple and
definitely wanted to keep in your purse
this is what the wand looks like and
when I saw this one at first I was like
that is not gonna do anything for my
lashes the bristles are smaller
bah-bah-bah and it's really actually
very good it's very good by itself I run
on here great by itself and linked
gifts volume and separate so I really
like this mascara a lot I think it's a
really great one just to kind of keep in
your purse and stuff great for everyday
used to if you don't feel like doing too
much mascara or anything just pop that
baby on you'll be good to go now this is
what I really like from L'Oreal I think
it's the collagen infused one it doesn't
say on the packaging all it says is
L'Oreal and on this sticky note I wrote
super black great but great volumizing
and I definitely recommend the one is
really nice as well you can see it's
kind of smaller in the middle and larger
on the outer portions of it it's just a
really nice mascara super black every
time I wear this I get compliments on
how thick my lashes look and they look
like false lashes so I really recommend
this one I know I haven't talked about
it much of my channel by actually use
this since when did I live in Alabama
2010 like November 2010 was the 2010 Wow
it was a long time ago yeah November
2010 I've used it since so I like this
and it's always been kind of like a
repurchase that I like to have in my
collection okay so my next favorite are
the Maybelline the falsies line I
absolutely love this line I have just
been so impressed with it and I just
really really love them so the first two
are actually the falsies flared of
course one little sticky note says love
on it but this one I used it's
waterproof and I use this for my bottom
lashes just gonna go ahead and show you
this one since they're both the same
it's just that nice curved one I really
really love it it does what it says if
flares out your lashes really well it
just like opens up your eye and I just I
love it make some volume eyes flare out
they've separate really well I just
highly recommend the falsies flared
mascara kind of has the little wing one
so make sure you kind of check them out
because I know there's this one as well
and this is the falsies volume Express
again with the love because already knew
what I loved about it this is the
Flossie's black drama it's just again
got a nice curved one a little bit of
shorter bristles actually have this on
my lashes today it is the only thing I
have
my lashes and I really love how like
volumize they are and how thick they
just look so nice I mean just by itself
it works perfectly I love it the next
three are pretty much my Holy Grail
mascaras the first one is this covergirl
lash perfection
I put awesome nth lengthening and
separating it doesn't give much volume
which I don't mind because I absolutely
love how how great this is at just
separating the lashes like late each
individual lash it's like separated and
it lengthens so well and you could just
pair this with like the falsies or this
other mascara I'm going to show you in a
minute to get really really gorgeous
lashes so I highly recommend this one
it's just a little gray tube it is a
rubberized one but I actually really
like this usually I don't like
rubberized ones but I really really like
this one so I totally recommend this
this is like my third or fourth one the
next one is the one by one volume
Express look at that ah mazing and I
love this mascara this is another
rubberized wand that I really really
love it's kind of got that different
kind of I guess ona would you call that
an oval type brush Anna really great at
just getting right in there getting each
lash getting to the root really
lengthening volumizing I mean it's just
gorgeous this is like my third tube as
well I absolutely love it it's just
definitely one of my favorites from the
drugstore this last one is a high-end
one I swear by this mascara talked about
a lot and when I run out of it I'm
definitely getting the full size and
it's the Estee Lauder sumptuous extreme
mascara totally obsessed with this you
could put this on any mascara like that
you have already on your lashes and it
just makes them ten times better it
looks like you're wearing false lashes
it's so thick it's so black it's just
the bomb the freakin bomb I I love it's
bad to pick only one mascara it'd be
this one because it's just gray by
itself as well so that's the wand I
didn't know what I was going to think of
this at first but I just started
experimenting with it I use it every
single day almost
um almost on the top of every mascara
that I have it's just I don't know it
really just adds that extra to your
lashes it's just the best hands down I
swear by it I you suggest you to go try
it out maybe even pick it up because it
is just the bomb so that was all my
mascaras I hope you guys enjoyed it I
tried to do I had a lot of drugstore in
here so I felt like you guys would
really like that a lot more not as so
much high-end stuff you know this is
definitely more accessible so I hope you
