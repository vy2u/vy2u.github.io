hair and skin favorites for the year
2013 and there's a lot of things that
I've really swore by this year and then
I just love so I wanted to share it with
you guys and I'm gonna start with hair
because I don't have as much hair as I
do
skincare so we're just gonna start off
with that I'm not going to show you guys
a shampoo and conditioner favorite just
because I feel like I switched them out
so much that I mean I love different
ones and I hated a bunch of different
ones but there's not one that I just
continuously used throughout the year
the only thing that I continuously use
is this macadamia deep a pear mask I
love this stuff I swear to you it is
amazing amazing amazing for damaged hair
I think this really helped me with my
transition of going from blonde to
brunette and getting my hair really
healthy again because my hair was pretty
damaged after being blonde for four
years this is a pretty pricey item but I
promise you it is so good everybody on
YouTube raves about it for a reason and
it's because it's so amazing next for
more of the haircare I love this new me
argan oil I've been using this for over
a year now and I adore it is my hair
really nice and smooth and it just looks
so nice just with oils you want to make
sure that you don't apply too much to
your hair doesn't get greasy but this
oil does not weigh my hair down at all
it just leaves it nice and smooth and
that's why I love it okay so the last
little heat protectant thing is this
kenra platinum blow-dry spray and I love
this stuff you guys seriously I don't
know what I did without it that's a
little dramatic but I'm dead serious
this stuff is so good I'm telling you
whenever I don't have it in my life I
feel like my hair is not as shiny as it
could be as you can see my hair is
really really shiny and I owe a bunch of
it to this it is pretty pricy I think
it's about twenty dollars or so but this
also helps protect your hair from the
blow-dryer and you know other heat that
you're gonna put on it so I love this
stuff you've got to check it out if
you're looking for and heat protectant
before you blow-dry now this is not
gonna come as a surprise to any of you
probably I've mentioned this so many
times in my videos is the batiste dry
shampoo for dark hair and I
this stuff you guys I'm telling you I've
probably gone through thirty of these
this year maybe even more I use it so
much I used to not be able to go like a
day or two not washing my hair and now I
can go like three or four days and I
think it all to this dry shampoo because
without it I honestly would not be able
to go as long without washing my hair so
love this stuff you've got to try it
it's amazing now on the subject of
actual hair so it has been my Bellamy
hair extensions I absolutely adore these
you guys I got them back it was back
before June I got these early this year
and I love my extensions these are the
220 grams 22 inch extensions in number
two a lot of you asked me with me dyeing
my hair so much if these still match and
they do they blend beautifully with my
hair if I just dye it if it's faded they
blend so so well they're so thick you
don't use them for length I just use
them to add more volume in my hair and
about for West is all I need and
literally it's like bombshell hair it's
insane so I love these if you're looking
for a good news set of extensions I
would recommend these now I just want to
mention a couple hair tools and really
quickly before I go into it I do want to
say I would never recommend something to
you guys if I didn't 100% stand by it
that's with everything in my videos no
matter what I'm talking about if I do
not love it I'm not gonna recommend it
to you I would never want you to go
spend money on something that is gonna
completely suck in the end just to put
somebody's name out there okay I will
let you know something stuff I will let
you know if something's ugly I just I'm
not afraid to let you know and if you've
been watching me for a while you know
I'm very honest about that this is the
nume megastar flat iron by far my
favorite flat iron I have ever ever
owned in my life no joke
before I started YouTube I did watch
YouTube videos and I saw a review on
this to do flat iron and I think I
purchased all flat iron experts or
something and I use that for so long and
I liked it but it does not compare to my
nume megastar this is so awesome
I haven't touched my studio one cent
this also helps with the shine in my
hair it makes my hair really smooth it's
so easy just to straighten your hair
because it does
take long at all it heats up to 450
degrees and you can also like adjust the
settings right here if you wanted to and
it heats up very fast as well but the
one thing that I really like about this
Flatiron other than mice to do one is
mice to do one had like square edges
this one has the rounded edges so it's
really easy to curl your hair and it's
not gonna leave like choppy lines in
your hair from trying to curl it with
one with straight edges so I love this
this is like a two-in-one a straightener
and a curling iron and I know a bunch of
you went out and purchased this based
off of my recommendation and you loved
it and I'm so happy you love it because
I'm just like I want to share with you
the amazing things that I try so
definitely check the stock you're
interested they have one in black and
pink I love the black just because it's
nice and sleek but and it kind of has
that NARS packaging too if you were
wondering so I know I do have a coupon
code for this down below it's 120
dollars off original price so you will
get this straightener for $80 which is a
great deal I've had this for so long and
I've not had any problems with it and
then I also want to mention curling
wands curling wands are my favorite
thing ever I just adore them I love
curling wands like I can't get enough
and of course these are from nume the
two barrels I've been using is the 32
millimeter one and also the 25
millimeter one so this one's going to
give you more bigger curls if you're
looking for something that's not a super
tight curl this would be the wand to go
to and then for more of a tighter curl
you can go with this one which is the 25
millimeter one but keep in mind if you
add more hair to the one it's gonna give
you kind of bigger curls as well okay so
that is it for hair products now we're
gonna go ahead and move on to skincare I
have so much skincare you guys it's
insane which I'm actually very proud of
myself this year I've wanted to work on
my skincare because everything like your
makeup and stuff it all looks so much
better if you take care of your skin
skin care is just so important and I I
can't believe I didn't care about it for
so long but now I'm like obsessed with
my skin and this is a Mac cleanse off
oil I love this stuff I got this off of
recommendation from missglamorazzi this
will take off your eye makeup so easily
if you have a waterproof mascara or
you're just having a hard time getting
eyeshadow off this is the way to go you
have
sensitive skin and I wanted to use this
as my makeup remover for my face makeup
as well this broke me out so bad I won't
use this on my face again but for the
eyes it is amazing another thing I want
to mention is this serum this is a
L'Oreal youth code serum this is
actually the second one I purchased but
this is awesome it makes my skin so
smooth and I just love the way it makes
my skin look I also think this helps a
lot with my redness and just like
calming down my skin so next is this
purity from philosophy face cleanser I
love this stuff this takes off all your
makeup I am not even joking I'm just
obsessed with it I think it's amazing
I'm so happy I went to this cleanser it
doesn't you know break me out called my
pores anything like that so if you're
looking for a good facial wash I
recommend this one they also have a
smaller size at Sephora they thinks
maybe like under ten dollars or
something so you could try it out moving
on to moisturizers the one I love for
daytime is this philosophy take a deep
breath moisturizer and I love this
because it's oil-free moisturizer and
it's also a gel cream moisturizer so it
really seems into the skin nicely even
though it does sink into the skin very
quickly it still keeps my skin nice and
moisturized and it feels really good
throughout the day so I love this
definitely tried if you have oily skin
and you're looking for a new boy stur
Iser and then this one I like to use
every now and then at nighttime I don't
use it every night but it's the
philosophy full of promise dual action
restoring cream for volume and lift I
absolutely love this stuff I'll put it
on after I've done my serums and
everything and it literally makes my
skin feel so plump and soft and just
luxurious so I love this I've been
really loving philosophy products for
skincare items this year and these are
by far my favorites okay let's just talk
about my Holy Grail eye cream for a
second this is by far my favorite eye
cream ever yes it is so expensive and I
cringe every time I have to buy it
skincare so important to me that I'm
just like bite the bullet and buy it
child so the eye cream that I use this
is Bobby Brown hydrating eye cream I
want to try the one above this one
that's like extra hydrating I forget
what they call it extra Repair hydrating
eye cream I think it is but this one I
purchased I believe three of them and it
is so good you guys I'm not even kidding
I used to have really little fine lines
right out in here which I am way too
young for all that so I should have had
those and once I started using this eye
cream I'm telling you literally it just
made my skin underneath my eyes so
moisturized concealer goes on like a
dream never looks cakey and I just love
it my under-eye has completely changed
due to this product and I cannot
recommend enough if you have kind of
like dehydration lines underneath your
eyes you've got to check this out so the
last like face skincare product is this
glam glow super mud clearing treatment
mask I didn't show this enough love and
then beginning you can see I'm almost
out but I didn't show this enough love
in the beginning because I just I don't
know I kind of forgot about face masks
but I have been just loving this I've
been using masks so much now for the
past few months and I love it I can use
a mask like once or twice a week and I
know it's such a huge difference with my
skin this one is awesome though because
it really pulls out all those impurities
and if I have like a breakout or
something I'll put this on at night and
it literally is like down it's not
completely gone but it's like gone down
so much the next day and I love it I
have a skincare tool and this one I
really love I'm just kind of on the
fence now because um I talked to my
aesthetician that I go see and she
doesn't like the Clair sonics at all she
told me that whenever she does facials
on people she can tell Clarisonic users
right away because it can damage your
skin if you use it too much so I do love
the Clarisonic I think it's played a
really big part in making my skin a lot
smoother and just better but I'm going
to start using it probably once or twice
a week not every night like I do now
because she said that it really damages
the skin and it's just she can totally
tell who's using the Clarisonic whatever
they send out of her life and you know I
trust estheticians if you have been
trained on something and you're letting
me know that something can potentially
harm my skin I'm going to listen so I
trust her she's been doing skincare and
everything for over 20 years and she
knows her stuff she actually gave me so
many tips I'm going off topic right now
but she gave me so many tips on how to
help my rosacea and stuff so oh thank
the Lord for her but yeah I love the
so I think it really does deep-clean the
skin just use it in moderation from what
I've learned okay I quickly want to
mention a body wash this is the tone of
body wash daily detox white clay jasmine
this is awesome I do love the cashmere
glow body wash and Bath and Body Works
but let's be real sometimes it can be
kind of expensive so you can get this at
Walmart I'm not sure where else maybe I
think CVS maybe Walgreens
I don't know but this stuff is so good
it smells amazing and it lingers on your
skin for so long okay so the last two
things I want to shout out for my yearly
favorites are self tanners I'm a self
tanning junkie I love self tanning I
know a lot of people rag me for self
tanning it looks Orange
it doesn't look orange but nice try let
me just say if people are ragging you
for self tanning let them know that
you're taking care of your skin and they
can go somewhere you're not gonna have
skin cancer in the long run okay so the
to self tanners I love are the st.
Tropez dark self-tanner and also the
Vita Liberata and dark as well this
one's really great I have to say I like
the bee deliver autumn more but I love
st. Tropez I think they have great
products and the dark one is definitely
one of my favorites it makes you very
very very very dark so I love this and
then the Vita Liberata like I said this
is a two to three week tan which don't
let them fool you I don't think it's two
or three weeks but it does last a long
time as long as you moisturize your skin
really nicely and it's so good you guys
it kind of has like a red base to it so
it makes you look a lot more natural
whereas this one I don't think has a red
base to it kind of give it has like a
yellow tinge to it but this one looks
more natural to me I really love it easy
to apply I've had some problems with the
bottles leaking like past ones I've used
but this one has been going strong and I
like it
so Beulah broad is definitely my
favorite self-tanner check it out
Sephora it's very good okay guys so that
is it for my hair and skin favorites for
2013 I cannot believe we're almost done
