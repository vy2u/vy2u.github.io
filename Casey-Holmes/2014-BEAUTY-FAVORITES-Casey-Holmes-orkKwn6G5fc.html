eat my 2014 of favorites this has been
so highly requested I always at the end
of the year have a hard decision of if I
want to do like December favorites or
yearly favorites cuz I feel like if I do
both of them it's a little overwhelming
I had a lot of things I loved for
December so I don't know if I should
wait till January favorites to put that
in there or if I should just do and
December favorites let me know in the
comments which you guys want to see
because I have no idea what you want to
see if you want to see two favorites
videos in a matter of a couple weeks
then I'll be more than happy to do that
for you or I can just wait till the
January favorites and then show you guys
then but I got a lot of stuff to show
you guys and this is just a make up
stuff because skin care and hair if I
included all of that this video would
Pete like 3 hours long gonna be so long
so I'm just gonna show you guys the
things that I picked out when I went
through my drawers and I was like yes
this is what they need to buy buy this
buy this buy this like all these
products I stand behind 110 percent and
I have nothing bad to say about them I
think they're all absolutely amazing
because most of you could probably tell
I did die of my hair back completely
dark I have not been this dark since
about a year and a half ago I used to
die all the time this color it is less
cherry if you watch me for a while then
you know I've talked about it I actually
leave it my video down below on how I
dye my hair how I died at this color and
everything like that actually show you a
little tutorial in that video as well so
a couple it's like a year and a half old
but hey I still do the same thing so I
will leave that down below I use the
same colors the only thing I did
different was I added a little bit of
chocolate in there which I'll leave all
the names of stuff I used in the
description box but I went back to a
lush cherry and I loved it I've missed
being super dark so I'm sure everybody
likes spring or summer I'll go back to
ombre but for now I was craving my dark
hair okay so first let's talk about
primers I have two primers that I want
to recommend it to you guys the first
one is the hourglass mineral veil
primary this is so amazing
I've seen a lot of different skin tones
like this I've seen dry skin people
combo and oily skin like this so I think
this is just a great all-around primer
it is oil for us
fifteen and this stuff lasts forever
like I had a little sample of it before
I bought the full-size that lasted me
probably like two or three months and
then I bought this one and I honestly
haven't made that big of a dent I mean I
kind of have it's like down to here but
I love this product it makes your skin
so smooth the makeup applies is so
amazingly I love this and I just think
it makes your makeup last so long and it
just creates it really nice and soft
canvas though I like this a lot
definitely one of my top favorites and
then the other one is this Smashbox pore
minimizing primer and this one is just
phenomenal
I've been using this for the past couple
of months and you can see it's pretty
well loved and I love this for my pores
I just think it's beautiful
I don't know I love this so much more
than the benefit Porefessional I'm
focusing on really making sure the pores
are nice and like minimized and I don't
know man this stuff is just good it is
oil free as well and I I love it if you
have bigger pores I would definitely
suggest trying this out I also think it
does help your makeup lasts a lot longer
as well moving on to foundations I have
two that are again my just my
outstanding I knew I loved these for the
moment I try them these are just my
all-time favorites you probably are
going to be surprised
the first one is Estee Lauder Double
Wear foundation I'm wearing this right
now I wear this all the time it is so
hard for me to try and use different
foundations just because this one is so
freakin good
I have rosacea if you have complementary
skin and you looking for a really
intense high coverage foundation this is
your go-to if you don't like a thicker
foundation that's gonna put a lot of
coverage on your face or anything like
that you won't like this but for me this
is beautiful I love it
honestly I don't like it's that heavy I
don't know if I'm just used to it but I
never felt like it was super heavy on my
skin I have heard some people say that
it was really heavy and they couldn't
use it I get the little pump thing on
the top of this from Mac it does not
come with a pump but I would definitely
suggest one so you can control how much
comes out and you don't waste any
product so I love this so much i
fluctuate through so many colors I mean
I have
more right here two more in my drawer I
just love this foundation so estee
lauder don't wear is amazing and keeping
you matte it will also just stay on your
face all night long when I went to visit
Amanda in Tennessee back in the
summertime I kept my foundation on
overnight which is not good don't
suggest it but I did it just because I
forgot to wash my face off and the next
morning she would be like oh my god your
skin your foundation look amazing and
I'm like it's that double wear girl it's
all about the double wear even when I'm
sweating I could block my face and it's
not gonna all come off so that's a huge
deal for me and I love that now for
something that's a little bit lighter
coverage not as heavy I definitely
recommend the ex1 invisi wear foundation
this is so beautiful I'm in the shade
300 and 400 I just mix them together
since I do self-tan that's what I have
to do this is beautiful for the skin it
just lays so beautifully it does not
accentuate your pores it makes
everything look nice and flawless and
really airbrush now this does not last
that long on me anymore I used to think
it lasted a while but if I like rub my
face too much or something like that it
will kind of wear off but I definitely
recommend a primer with this and I
definitely recommend sending it with a
little bit of powder so that it will
just last a little bit longer for you
throughout the day so love this I think
dry skin will love it definitely combo
and oily skin would love this as well so
a floor concealer I obviously have to
imagine a Mac Pro Longwear this is just
so phenomenal like the coverage is
beautiful if you have really bad dark
circles Pro Longwear and if you want
something that's not gonna settle into
your fine lines that bad then I would
definitely recommend Mac Pro Longwear if
I do not set this a powder it will
crease into my fine lines I've heard
some people say that it shouldn't crease
but mine does so if it happens to you it
is normal who just said it with some
powder
but I love this so much I'm in the color
NW 25 it's what I currently have ernie's
my eyes and it just blends so well and
it doesn't dry out my under eye area
which is really important also an
under-eye moisturizer is really
important for that as well but if you
still feel like your concealers just
like too tacky and like dry and not
really blending definitely give us want
to go and a little bit does go a long
way so this stuff last you forever
amazing also I've been loving this NARS
radiant creamy concealer not necessarily
for underneath my eyes I felt like it
creased way too much but I love this for
my nose I don't know why there's just
something about this concealer I love it
too for highlighting my nose it really
helps slender it out and make it look
nice and contoured I just I love it
I can't not put this on my nose when I
don't I noticed like a huge difference
I'm like oh my gosh I forgot to put my
highlight on my nose they last for a
long time as well I've heard a lot of
people say they love this for their
under eyes but for me it just wasn't
cutting it for me so I used it for my
nose and I've just been obsessed with it
ever since then the last thing is
something you have to excuse me for
because it's dirty it's been dirty for
months but this is the Mac Pro and
conceal palette I've hit pan on two of
these colors right here I use the in
Seaside and see what is it 30 and 35 I'm
not so much use out of this palette more
used to not ever thought I would get out
of it I believe it's the studio finished
concealers in here really great at
covering acne or any redness if I happen
to get a little bit of redness right
here I'll just go in with this bad boy
cover it up and then we'll be good to go
I just I think this is a great palette I
love it and it was a great way for me to
try out different colors love this so
much you guys definitely recommend it
but before you go and get this NYX does
have one I actually purchased it the
other day it's a great little dupe for
it so I do like the next concealers I
just have to say the Mac one is
obviously my favorite cuz I'm use it for
so long but you can see NYX did come out
with one and very very similar so try
this out if you don't want to fork out
the money for the Mac one to powder I'm
just going to mention two now if I do
set my face which I have not been
studying my entire face for the last few
months just because I don't feel like I
need it but if I do set my face I will
use the Laura Mercier translucent a face
powder I love this this is the one for
if you have oily skin
I just I think it's great it's a really
really really fine powder and it's not
gonna look caked up on the skin or
anything like that and it's not gonna
alter your foundation line move it
around
it's just going to set it in place and
make sure it stays matte all day so
Laura Mercier translucent powder is
beautiful love this so much even though
it just got all over me and then to set
my concealer I have been loving the
Anastasi of banana powder now I got this
kit and I have not really played with
the contour shades just because um I
don't know I just so far they're not
really my favorite I think I need to
experiment a little bit more with these
but the standout color is definitely the
banana and I think she has this in for
sale individually on her site on um
Stasi Beverly Hills calm or something
like that
but I won't be surprised when I hit pan
on this because it's it's beautiful and
I use it to set everything it just
really brings up the face and nothing
creases or moves when I set it with this
powder so love this a lot definitely
recommend it for an under-eye concealer
or setting whatever your t-zone okay
bronzer I'm quickly going to go through
these because I have a lot of bronzers
these are just the bronzer is that every
month if I switch to one out
it was always these six bronzers so
let's just let's get through it shall we
so the first bronzer is benefit hoola I
love this bronzer so much I just think
it's beautiful if I don't know what
bronze are how to use for the day or if
I just need something I know I can rely
on it is this one because it blends
beautifully the color is perfection and
I love it and it does have a little bit
more of an ashy undertone to it it's not
very ashy but there's just a little bit
in there to where it creates a really
nice shadow under your cheekbones so I
love this so much and then I also have
loved the Smashbox suntan Mac bronzer
this one's more warm I love this to
bronze up the skin not so much contour
but I love this just to warm up the skin
on the high points on my face like my
forehead cheekbones and a little bit
right underneath my jaw so this is
beautiful blends out amazing a great
warm shade and then I love this Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer this was
the medium to deep one this one's
perfect to contour with I just love it
so much it's not as warm and it creates
that really nice shadow again underneath
the cheekbone I think all of these that
I'm mentioning to you are just going to
be personal preference and see which one
you like best
but these are definitely ones I
recommend trying out and this one smells
like chocolate so I can't really go
wrong and it does taste like chocolate
so I'm just saying and then I want to
mention this one from Laura Mercier this
is the bronze OH - I love this one -
again bronze up and warm up the skin not
so much contour it doesn't really have
that grandma color payoff for me to just
contour with it but to warm up the face
it adds a really nice golden glow and I
love it I think it's absolutely
beautiful and this has lasted me so long
like it's not going down anytime soon so
love this so much very very beautiful
and then another one to contour this one
feat Estee Lauder bronze goddess I guess
it's called bronze goddess soft matte
bronzer this one does have a little bit
of shimmer in it but you can't see it
this is definitely warm on the red side
and I like this though I actually do
like this to contour I think it looks
really beautiful it adds a little bit
something different to your contour
since it is more on the red side hello I
really really like this it blends out
easily as well I believe I got this from
a CCO but I'm not sure if they sell it
in stores or not I'm sure if you looked
it up online you could probably find it
but this is a really great bronzer - and
it's ginormous like you see how big it
is it is huge s1 I want to mention is
this Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light
love this one - contour so much I could
see the rings around it I was using this
so much at one point I just think it is
beautiful I go back and forth with what
kind of bronzers I want to use at the
contour and this one is just absolutely
stunning this one's like a good mix of
ashy and warm tones it's not just like
really really warm or really really ashy
so I love this a lot again it is going
to light and it blends like a dream it's
a very smooth powder and I love this one
a lot
moving on to blushes I have about five
four five five the first one is by NARS
and it is madly madly is such a stunning
shade telling you you swatch it you're
like what the hell
nothing going on with that color but you
put it on your cheeks and it just looks
beautiful likes watching it really does
not do it any justice
I believe I used this in one of my last
tutorials so I will leave it down below
so you can check it out
but madly is stunning it's beautiful oh
my gosh I love it and I've seen a lot of
people with different skin tones that
love this from really really fair to
more on the darker side as well
darker than me and they've loved it so
check it out just put it on your cheeks
it's beautiful
NARS madly baby I will be hitting pan on
this very soon I know I will this one
from Mac is a pro longwear blush and
eternal Sun I'm a sucker for blushes man
I just I love a blush I love a good good
blush so this is what this one looks
like it's more of a brownie Rose kind of
color it's very stunning it's definitely
a lot darker than when it's coming off
on camera but I just love this one this
gives a nice warm look to the skin and
it blends really well it's pro longwear
so it's gonna last a long time and I
love it it's just so beautiful look good
really loving Becca blushes and I
couldn't just pick one so I picked it
three of my favorites which of the only
three that I have first one is Sweet Pea
which just looks like this is absolutely
stunning that's that one right there I
like this one because it's kind of like
a Mavi brownish pink color very very
pretty
these Becca blushes are all smooth
creamy they blend really well so I love
that this one is damselfly so I'm so
pretty I love a damselfly this is
damselfly right there a little bit
lighter it has more of that pinky orange
tint to it I think it's absolutely
beautiful and then last one is songbird
songbird is just a gorgeous kind of like
a burnt orange shade which I was
obsessed with these colors at one point
in my life and I still love them that's
it right there it just has like a kind
of golden sheen to it it's very very
beautiful I love these kind of burnt
orange shades for summer involved which
are whenever
okay moving on highlighters I have three
standout ones this one it was limited
edition but mm-hmm
do you not see that it's just so pretty
this is Estee Lauder's heatwave
it's a gorgeous golden highlight like
seriously it is so it is just oh my god
it is my gosh oh my gosh why did they
not make this permanent is so stinking
beautiful if you can get your hands on
Estee Lauder heat wave don't you dare
leave without it it is beautiful you
could probably find this online for a
lot more pricey than it was like when it
was in stores but honestly I think it's
worth it now the next one is by Becca
this is such a well-known one it is
called opal opal is just a classic color
these Becca highlights are actually be
so beautiful and very very creamy this
one does have more of like a champagne
undertone to it like a champagne gold
it's not as gold as heatwave but there's
a little champagne in there but this one
is absolutely stunning do you see that
oh my gosh highlighters are giving me
life right now this one I'm showing you
now it's by Bobbi Brown and is called
phase oh my gosh these shimmer bricks
are amazing and I have been absolutely
loving them highly recommend beige is
just so stinking beautiful like oh my
gosh this hand of highlights though like
I cannot get over it so that's it right
there it's a little bit lighter okay
moving on to palettes all right I'm
gonna show you guys I shadow palette
first I'm just going to kind of quickly
run through them because I do have quite
a bit I have one two three four five I
have five but the first one is by BH
Cosmetics and it's the its duty time
palette if you're looking for more of a
affordable palette this one is perfect
this palette is just beautiful you have
a range of neutrals and then some
brighter shades as well to do like a fun
pop of color I love it the colors are
very pigmented and they blend out really
really well so by far my favorite most
affordable palette ever like I think
it's beautiful I think it was like ten
dollars at one point moving on I'm going
to mention a couple on estancia palettes
this one's the lavish palette I don't
know if she still has these for sale or
not
I would hope so because they're actually
insanely beautiful but this one is in
the lavish palette the one thing that I
really love about Anasazi palettes is
the range of colors she has such a great
variety of shades in these palettes and
they make you feel so creative this
one's the tamanna' palette this one Z
lavish palette these are the two
palettes I have loved you can see you
have your basic shades in there where
you can have a matte crease or a matte
highlight a matte outer corner like you
have some matte deeper shades some
really pretty shimmery shades I just
think these are beautiful like every
time I see a new palette from Anasazi
I'm just like yes it's gorgeous like you
can't not want to buy it so I did buy
both of these I don't work with honest
Asya and I absolutely adore them and
think that they are 100% worth the money
I mean look at these colors so pretty
and of course you guys know I could
never mention palettes not mentioning my
two ultimate favorite palettes ever now
I recommend these over Urban Decay I'll
even recommend them over honest Asya
whatever palettes that you want this
these two palettes are for you if you
get these two palettes I've sprayed you
don't think any other eyeshadows in your
life because I just think they're all
amazing and they're all you need you
have a warm palette which is the lorac
Pro palette which has more of the warm
shades you have a row of mapped up top
and then a row of shimmer here on the
bottom and then you can also have a cool
toned palette which is the lorac pro 2
palette and again they went with the
same concept which I love with the matte
shades on top and these shimmer shades
on bottom these palettes aren't amazing
the quality does not differ they are
both so creamy easy to blend and I just
love them and I've had this one for a
while you can see I've hit pan on one
two three and I'm gonna hit pan on light
brown here really really soon but I
obviously use more warm tones in my
videos let's let's all be real Larco one
and the two you need them in your life
like I if you don't have these palettes
you really need to try to get them I
think this is a great palette to use as
well if you're like me and like to use
more warm shades this will really be a
great palette to have just
to kind of experiment with different
cool tones and I just love the fact that
they have mattes in here like matte cool
tone shades are so beautiful I love them
so lorac pro one and two they did so
good with these palettes I love them
okay so really quick I want to mention a
primer I have loved this so much this
year it is the NARS a pro Primus smudge
proof eyeshadow primer I've used I think
I've gone through I think 2 of these is
whole here whenever I discovered it I'm
not sure when but if you have oily
eyelids you need this in your life the
way that I use is that I apply it first
before my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre my
eyelids get so oily that they would even
break through the Paint Pot buy stuff by
Mac and soft ochre and I was just like
oh my god everybody else is like oh this
is amazing and then my eyeshadows
creasing so much throughout the day so I
ended up getting this because I heard
from Ingrid which is Miss glamour Otzi I
heard this from her a long time ago that
this was amazing and I finally picked it
up put it underneath Mac Paint Pot
because this is clear it is not a color
- did one so it's not going to really
give you an even campus that's why I put
this on first it helps control the oil
and then I put a little bit of Mac's
Paint Pot in soft ochre on top just to
even out the lids and give a really good
face and I'm good my eyeshadow lasts all
day all night it's like the perfect
combo that I will never stop using like
I'm so picky about my primers because
when you have oily eyelids it's very
very hard to find something that's gonna
work for you I think most brands don't
really think about eyelids that are
super oily I just don't think that's
like one of their most common thoughts I
think they just think about what they
can provide to make your eyeshadow last
a long time this NARS smudge proof
eyeshadow base with Mac Paint Pot on top
holy grill will forever use it for I'm
kind of going in a weird order so I'm
sorry but for brows I have been loving
this a Mac fluidline and deep dark
brunette is what I have on my brows
right now I've been using this for a
pretty long time you can see how much
I've used of it this is insane I feel
like like that's a lot of product gone I
absolutely love it I love the color that
it gives my brows I used this when I had
more of an ombre hair and
here was a lighter I also can use it now
that I dyed my hair really nice and dark
so I love it so easy to work with just a
little bit goes a very very long way and
it blends really well in your brows like
it's just beautiful this is hands-down
my favorite brow product I have tried in
2014 it is beautiful oh and it lasts
forever seriously it will last for ever
okay so last two things are lip products
and a couple mascaras so the first
mascara are the only mascara I really
want to talk about I've used so many
false lashes this month or this year
this past year it's not even funny like
I'm a lash aholic now I cannot go
without false lashes unless I'm doing no
makeup I need false lashes just because
I feel incomplete which it's kind of bad
but I mean I just love them but the
mascara i'll use non-stop is this
l'oreal miss manga mascara i love this
mascara it gives a ton of volume so when
i don't want to wear mascara this still
makes me feel like i have a lot of
lashes i love it it just lasts for a
really long time doesn't flake doesn't
smudge and it's not waterproof because i
don't i'm not all about that waterproof
life I can't not waterproof mascara I
can't do it in speaking of false lashes
I just have to mention velour lashes I
have worked with velour lashes for I
think this whole year that whole last
year and I I stand by this brand 100%
I'm wearing the girl you crazy ones now
my all-time favorite style from them is
growing you crazy which I have on my
eyes right now
domi up is another favorite and I've
been trying some new ones like winging
it and wispy sweet enough things I've
been loving so they actually sent this
for Christmas like as a Christmas gift
and you can see I've used obviously my
favorite one doll me up there gone girl
you crazies on but I literally screamed
when I got this in the mail because I
love the lore and the fact that I'm able
to try out all of their lashes was so
incredibly amazing to me and I was so
excited about it just because I work
with them does not mean that that's the
only reason why I'm mentioning them I
just think this is a really great brand
they they look the most natural I
personally don't use any other lashes
because I feel like these are dramatic
but they don't look so dramatic that
they look completely fake on the eyes
especially girly
I just think they look really fluffy and
beautiful and they lasted so long for me
so I absolutely adore velour lashes I do
have coupon codes for them if you're
interested but this brand is awesome
definitely check them out and then for
lash glue I have to shout out the House
of lashes lash glue this one's amazing
it really gets tacky nice and quickly
and your lashes will not go anywhere
once they're on your eyes I hope you
like them because they are not coming
off which I love like even in the inner
corner they're not going anywhere so
absolutely adore the House of lashes
lash glue for liner the stick liner I
have been loving is this NARS
larger-than-life eyeliner this is a
great liner to have if you have a
problem with eyeliner smudging really
bad this one is my ultimate favorite I
love it that's it right there it's super
black really creamy you don't have to
sharpen it keep that in mind then you
get this just twist it up do you not
sharpen it um but yeah I love this it is
so beautiful I mean it's been one of my
favorites for a while and I constantly
repurchase it and then for a gel liner I
want to shout out the BH Cosmetics gel
liner I love this it's super black I
have it on my eyes right now it's really
easy to work with and I've had it for a
while and it has not dried up on me and
I've actually gotten pretty deep into
the pan so I love this one so so much I
keep going back to it even if I try
hiring once this one is just my favorite
for lip products I have a few I have
some lip liners for you this one is the
max morning coffee
I love morning coffee I think it is
absolutely beautiful it's a gorgeous
kind of Mavi pink color we're on the
mall side but it's beautiful and it has
a little hint of brown in there as well
studying it's a pro longwear one so it's
gonna last forever I also love Mac swirl
this one will Lou up this year those
look really similar they're really
really similar this one I think whirls a
little bit more on the mauve side but I
love it so much world is the one that
Kylie Jenner wore this year and just
blew it up all over the makeup world so
love whirl it's actually really really
stunning it's not for a long we're just
from their regular lip line another one
I've been loving is by Mac and it's
called stripped down it's a great
neutral liner it's
more on the brown side but I love it too
my my lips I can't find it anywhere and
then oh I forgot to mention this for
brows I've been loving the on estancia
tinted brow gel and brunette I think
this is just the perfect finishing gel
for your brows because it really makes
everything look blended and nice and if
you feel like you went a little too dark
with your brows you can put this on and
it lightens them up and it just looks
really natural and I just I don't know I
can't not put this on top of my brows
after I'm done like I can't do a clear
gel or anything it has to be this one
because I just feel like everything
blends and looks so much more natural
with it don't be scared by the color I
was it looks so good on the brows don't
let the color scare you because it's
amazing and then for lip products I just
want to mention these Alaura Pro and
matte lip pencils I love them I love
pink taupe I love rose brown which is
right here it's exactly what it says a
nice rosy brown color so pretty these
are very creamy to be matte lip products
so that's why I highly recommend them
and then this one is also mauls I can't
find pink topaz well but I love these
shades right here mouth is so stinking
pretty love it love it love it and then
I also loved Kat Von D's everlasting a
liquid lipsticks these are beautiful
this one's in Vampira I wore this in my
New Year's Eve hair tutorials with a
selfie station this is what I wore in
that video and I love it it is such a
different color on me
it comes it up more of like a brownie
comes out more of a like on the one it
looks like it would be like Mac's rebel
but not on me it turns out more of like
a darker brown with some red and then
when it dries there's like a copper tint
to it it's I don't know what it I don't
know I don't know what is found it what
color are supposed to be honestly but I
love this one and I can't get enough of
it so that's what it looks like right
there definitely a more brown color with
copper and red I love it some people
have gotten a different color out of it
but that's what pops up on my skin tone
and I'm like I can work with it love
this and Lolita I can't find Lolita
either right now but I love Lolita so
good I did a makeup tutorial with Lilia
so I'll leave that down below if you
guys want
get out so for lip glosses and things
like that it changes so often that I
decided to not include them in this
video just because it changes a lot and
there's not really like a step one that
I love all year round so that's why I
didn't include a lip gloss but I love
those lip products I just showed you
guys and the same definitely goes for
lipsticks there's not just one that I
can think of my mind to point out that I
just have to be like okay go buy this
