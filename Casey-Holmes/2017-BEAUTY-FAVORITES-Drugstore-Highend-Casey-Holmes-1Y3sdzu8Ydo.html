today I'm gonna be doing my 2017 beauty
favorites and I have a bunch of
different stuff here to share with you
guys and all this stuff I went through
all my drawers and I saw each thing that
I loved this year the brand the type of
thing from the brands and these are all
products that I really recommend and
then I think are amazing and I'm going
to share my thoughts with you guys
actually not feeling too good today it's
my first day
my first girly day and I'm a little bit
grumpy but luckily we are doing a happy
video not a products I regret buying in
2017 because then that would be really
bad a few guys wanted me to do like a
products I regret buying in 2017 I can
do that I don't think I've ever done
that I don't I don't think I've ever
done that but if you guys want to see it
I'll be more than happy to do it for you
because we had some misses this year if
you won't want for like hair skin body
just things like that let me know in the
comments or give this video a like to
let me know and I will probably do that
for you if you guys want to see it
anyway so don't forget to subscribe
before you leave and let's just go ahead
and get started alright so the first
thing is primers I have two obvious ones
here that I know a lot of you are going
to be like duh you didn't shut up about
those these are the two primers that
I've used year-round this one's actually
almost out but we have these Smashbox
photo finish primer water and then they
came in Austin prime and protect
mattifying primer now this primer water
I love because it gives me hydration but
it doesn't make me Oly which is why I
love it the most I don't necessarily
think it keeps my makeup on for a long
period of time or anything like that but
I do have really oily skin and I don't
necessarily go to moisturizing primers
so I feel like this is the perfect one
for me because sometimes even with oily
skin I feel kind of dehydrated and dry
and it's really important to keep that
moisture in your skin I love this for
that I think it's amazing I noticed a
difference when I do not use this
product it's a must-have every single
time I put on my makeup I'm water
hands-down one of the best you can keep
it in your refrigerator and it feels
really nice and cooling on your face now
this one is amazing if you have texture
large pores if you just want to really
really smooth to you zone area this is
the primer for you it is expensive but I
swear to you it is the best thing I've
ever
used for texture like there's no other
primer that actually compares to this
when it comes to helping with texture
and filling in pores I just think it's
really great I've gone through like two
or three bottles this year it also has a
tint to it so kind of color corrects as
well but I do recommend putting
something on top of it because it
doesn't look no it doesn't look as
natural and it is a darker tint so if
you are on the more fair side this will
probably be a little bit dark for you
you can see it right there yeah this
one's my favorite came in Austin
mattifying primer you can get both of
these at Sephora on another night look
how big this Real Techniques sponge is
that I bought I bought it just because
it's huge and I wanted my foundation
with it so I did it today and I didn't
realize that it's like too massive it's
too much him so for drugstore my
favorite primer is definitely still the
one heck of a blot primer from soap &amp;amp;
Glory this helps keep you matte it kind
of helps the pores not 100% I do have it
on right now and it does look really
nice with the foundation I'm wearing is
also really good too I mention that in a
second but I do like this for keeping me
matte this does not let me get shiny
throughout the day I think it is one of
the best I used to be obsessed with the
soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a blot
foundation but I I need to go back
through my foundations that I used to
love and try them out again I need to
just hold off on all this new stuff and
see how I feel about them now because I
still feel like I love that like the
Sonia Kashuk satin matte foundation the
stuff of Glory one I just need to try
them all out I still think this is like
the best mattifying primer from the
drugstore you can get at Target Ulta
anywhere that soap &amp;amp; Glory is sold and
it is a good affordable price so let's
talk about foundations I'm gonna go to a
high-end again so I didn't even mention
in the video but we're doing high-end in
drugstore in this video because it's
just I don't know I decided to compile
them all and ended up working out I have
a lot of high-end foundations to share
with you guys and these were the ones
that really just stood out to me as I
was picking through my drawers so the
first one is the one that I am wearing
now this is the Too Faced peach perfect
comfort matte foundation oil-free 14
hour where it's oil controlling and
photo friendly so this is what it looks
like and then it does have a pump I'm
right now wearing the shade warm beige
it's probably like the perfect spot on
shape for me when I'm nice and self tan
like it is just the perfect undertone
it's awesome I love it I like to apply
this with a Beauty Blender
I can't remember
if I used to like this with a brush but
I've been applying over the
Beautyblender recently and I really
really like it and it just covers really
well it has medium to full coverage you
can build this up and it does keep you
mapped next up is a Smashbox to do skin
and foundation this is such a good
foundation if you want coverage but want
that lightweight feel like this isn't
too heavy on the skin this just gives
you really healthy gorgeous looking skin
it really does hydrate make you look
plump and that's what I love it for this
isn't a full coverage foundation on me I
do have to build it up I never really
wear foundations that only have medium
coverage for the most part but this is
my exception I love this one I also use
this to contour not this shade but I've
used this to contour when I was in Fiji
I tried it out and it looked so good
blend it so well I didn't really have to
use a powder contour or anything so I
really recommend these have a lot of
shades and even though I have oily skin
I do really like this one but I would
prefer it in the winter time I will say
that summertime this doesn't last that
long but more in the winter time it
lasts a little longer okay so these are
my top two foundations one of them
actually just kind of came out in at the
end of December but I got it at the end
of November to try it out and I loved it
so I'm going to share it with you guys
but there is one con to it so it's just
kind of one of those things we're gonna
have to weigh your option I've had a lot
of you ask me about this foundation and
I love it okay I love this foundation
this is the new NARS natural radiant
long wear foundation now when I first
got this I was a little nervous because
I was like oh yeah don't mind myself tan
triste by the way when I first got this
I was a little nervous because it says
radiant so I was like oh god I don't
know I don't know but I've kind of been
more open to trying things that say Rea
more moisturizing just because you never
know this to me is not very radiant I
feel like it's more on the matte side it
definitely dries down Mac and it sits
really well on my skin it does not
accentuate anything on your face this is
a full coverage foundation I'm obsessed
with this foundation it's perfect I love
it only thing that I don't like is it
does not last very long at all I get a
little bit shiny in my t-zone it's
really not even a lot but it is
something that I do like to kind of take
care of and just blot away so it doesn't
get really crazy throughout the night
and if I blot it it does kind of
separate on my skin so for me this last
about eight hours to look really nice
and really smooth and just perfect and
then after that it's pretty much done
for I need to take it off but I do
really like this for any special
occasions for photos I just think this
is beautiful does have a pump as well I
think packaging is really nice it's a
glass bottle bin anyways I know a lot
even asked me about this and I love it
however one that does last a long time
that I love and I did use this on my
wedding day is the YSL all hours
foundation let me fix this time real
quick so like I said this is the one I
sell all hours foundation it's up to 24
hour wear flawless matte full coverage
and oil-free I was super excited when
they came out with this this year
because I had never found a wise self
foundation that I really loved if you
like a lot of the higher higher-end
foundations kind of go for more mature
skin or people with dry skin just not
really oily once I tried this out I fell
in love with it it does have a pump as
well it is pretty expensive and it
doesn't have one fluid ounce but this
looks so gorgeous on your skin in photos
flash photography it is perfection
the last one I want to talk about is the
hourglass vanish stick foundation this
is one that I cannot use in the
summertime too much if I'm going out and
about because like I said I'm a li and
this will just kind of become oil slick
on my face but it's a really pretty oil
slick on one of them others this is
gorgeous it's a full coverage stick out
of all stick foundations that I've ever
tried this is by far the best it is so
full coverage looks absolutely stunning
on the skin and this color what does
this warm beige is perfect for me
absolutely perfect I've had this for so
long I still have like quite a bit left
I believe yeah holy crap it's really
easy to apply I just do like little
stripes on my face kind of have fun with
it my prefer way to blend this out is
definitely with a brush something and
that is like a kabuki style brush sponge
really doesn't do it for me or flimsy
brush it just doesn't blend it out as
well I need something to really get in
there and spread that product around so
this with a like flat top kabuki brush
it is so gorgeous now moving on to
drugstore I do have three drugstore
foundations I'm
start with like my least favorite of my
favorites and then get to my absolute
favorite drugstore foundation of the
year the first one is the maybelline
superstay better skin foundation I
believe this came out this year I could
be a hundred percent wrong but I love
this so much this kind of reminds me of
a drugstore version of the Smashbox one
because this is again medium to full
coverage cuz you really healthy looking
skin looks like you have a nice natural
glow this buff base shade is perfect for
me it does have a pump it's a glass
bottle you can't really go wrong with
this I think it looks great on the skin
if you're new to my channel I also have
very sensitive skin I actually have
rosacea and none of this stuff irritates
my skin none of it makes me break out
anything like that so just put that out
there I really love this one from
Maybelline again it's the better skin I
also love something else from this line
which you guys will see in a little bit
the next one is the covergirl healthy
elixir foundation and this one's in the
shade nude beige again you have a really
nice glass bottle drugstore is really
stepping it up this year they did a
great job or last year now drugstore did
really really great last year with
coming out with awesome product this is
a gorgeous foundation this is more on
the dewy ish side for me for being oily
but it lasts so long and it doesn't make
me like an oily mess you don't want to
mean it just makes me look really
healthy and radiant and when I wear this
I make sure that I have my face
completely set with powder and then I
keep my blotting sheets with me just in
case I get a little oily but this does
last for such a long time beautiful on
the skin I highly recommend it and then
we'll get to my favorite this is my
all-time favorite foundation of the year
because it is just beautiful this is the
wet wild photo focus foundation and if
you guys have been watching me this year
you know this is not a surprise this is
just one of my go-to drugstore
foundations it is so nice again you have
that glass bottle actually like the
spatula I've grown to love it because
it's so easy to dot it all over your
face they tested this foundation under
seven light conditions it looks
phenomenal and photo this covers
everything beautifully it does build up
very nicely nothing ever gets cakey and
it lasts throughout the entire night
favorite way to apply this is with a
Beauty Blender or be sponge whatever you
want to get I think it's foundations
like five bucks or something
so affordable and so good some people
say it smells like paint but okay yeah I
could see that I could see that but it
doesn't really bother me to be honest
with you I don't really pay too much
attention to it but just keep that in
mind if you're wanting to purchase that
now we got all of our foundations out of
the way we're gonna move on to yellow
again starting off with high-end I only
have one high-end because this was the
standout concealer of the year for me I
think nothing tops it it just looks
beautiful actually that's a freaking
line it's a line that's a lie because I
can't pull it out
but I love this other one just as much
okay so I can't find it right now but I
also love the NARS radiant creamy
concealer the one that's in the pot that
is a beautiful concealer I love that one
so much to wear any time of the year
with any foundation it really just
enhances the way your under eyes look
like it never looks like you're wearing
concealer but it is a full coverage
concealer it's just stunning so I highly
recommend that one as well as this
heart-shaped tape I mean I feel like
this is gonna be an everyone's favorites
because it was just such a hit and so
hard to top just know that when you use
this a little bit does go a long way
even though I go crazy and I do a lot
but figured I would say if you don't
like a lot of concealer a little bit
does go a long way with this one okay
and then if we're drugstore I just have
these two these two I kind of used like
as my enhancers in a way I would use
tart shaped eight in the inner corner
and then these on like the outer parts
just to kind of highlight and bring some
light to my face the first one is the
Maybelline fit me concealer in number 20
sand this is more of a medium coverage
concealer nothing too crazy and high
coverage or anything like that but it
does look really great on the skin and
it looks great paired with other
concealers that are more full covered
love this one it's drugstore can't go
wrong with it and then we also have this
super stay a better skin from Maybelline
this concealer is really nice actually I
still use this on its own and this
concealer really does look awesome with
this foundation they were just made for
each other
this doesn't crease underneath your eyes
doesn't make your under eyes look dry
doesn't sting like the laurio pro one
whoa concealer and that is more medium
coverage but I really love it has a
little bit more coverage than the
Maybelline fit me for me gonna move on
to powders I have two high-end ones so
the first one is the two-faced peach
perfect powder I really like this powder
a lot I'm wearing it again right now
this powder does have a smell to it so
if you're sensitive to smells this might
be a little too strong for you and also
I will say it does taste pretty good
taste like peaches but don't go dumping
this in your mouth like fun dip okay it
tastes good but like I only taste it
when I'm patting it onto my face with my
brush and then I breathe in and just get
to my mouth but I don't like sit there
and eat it I would not recommend that
this is a gray powder I love it I think
it's one of the best powders that came
out this year as well as a couple other
ones the packaging is really pretty I
liked a lot of stuff from the Too Faced
peach collection but I also didn't like
a lot of things as well but this is
definitely a hit when my favorite
favorite product well as the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder I
went back to this this year I was really
surprised because I found other powders
that I liked and kind of got away from
this but I did use this for my wedding
it looked really great in photos there
was no flashback and it really made me
look smooth and flawless and all the
photos and it lasted all day and I was
very impressed by this Laura Mercier
loose setting powder one of my favorite
then for drugstore I have a couple
powders but the one powder that I really
love I can't find right now but I do
have the top to it
that's how unorganized my life is right
now this is the LA pro powder HD high
definition setting powder this powder
comes in a couple shades but the one I
like is banana yellow so it has a really
kind of light yellow tint to it so it
highlights the face really well but when
you take photos it's not like a stark
white type of look underneath your eyes
you know it just looks really nice and
bright I did go through one whole tub of
this loved it I purchased another one
and I can't find it so oh just getting
about it okay perfect I came back from
traveling and I have no idea where this
was this is super affordable it's la
girl and again I use the shade banana
yellow okay so for high-end bronzers I
have the Marc Jacobs tantastic bronzer
this is the one that I believe came out
in the summer for like a summer
collection it has a
cannot smell to it this color was
perfect I believe this was a limited
edition product but they need to
seriously bring this back it's way
better than the other bronzer that they
have which I did like that one too but
once I tried this one I was like this
one's way better this is like perfect it
blends really well it looks great on the
skin it's just like were those perfect
tones for me it's not too warm not too
ashy and I just love it and I love this
compact it's so sleek and pretty I
travel with this quite a bit this year
and it really lasted well and did not
break so thank God was actually gonna
save this bronzer palette for my January
favorites but I figured I would go ahead
and just share it with you real quick it
is the Park Avenue princess palette from
Tarte this is the chisel palette you
need this palette you have to have this
is obviously one of the best high-end
bronzer palettes I've ever tried and it
has amazing highlight shades as well and
these are both matte so can't go wrong
it's good I figured I would quickly pop
it in here I'll probably mention in my
January favorite let that pass and then
drugstore just really killed it with
bronzer this year I fell in love with so
many different drugstores stuff first
one that is a must-have in my opinion is
Neutrogena Healthy Skin blends natural
radiance bronzer when I love is in 30
Sunkist this is that perfect warm tone
bronzer to bronze up my face this makes
you look like you went on a vacation
came back bronzed as heck you know what
I'm saying lens really well it's like a
high-end product from the drugstore and
I bought this on a whim one time and I
just couldn't get enough this is
actually my second one and I've already
beaten it up or dropped a few times this
is amazing highly recommend that other
one that I recommend is this number 7
bronzer this is in the shade caramel
again this is so pretty this is great
from when I'm a little bit lighter as
well because it gives me that nice warm
tan without being too in-your-face
I love this I can't contour with it cuz
it doesn't give me that depth that I
want but as a all over face prawns err
this is so pretty again blends really
well and then really quickly this Ulta
contour kit I like this a lot
I liked this a lot mainly for these two
shades they looked really great on the
skin you have a lot of different colors
in here I also used a lot of these
darker colors like for my eye shadow and
things like that throughout the year if
I was traveling a lot of times I'll just
throw bronzer in the crease
I'm done put a little mascara on and
that's all you need but I loved warmth
bronzer and bombshell bronzer mixed a
lot they were just so perfect for me I
never really use the highlighter as much
up here but the bronzers are really nice
and then the last kind of like this is
more of like a trio palette which I do
have highlighters and blushes in here I
want to mention to you guys but this
does have a bronzer in it and I just
want to quickly shout out to flower
beauty because there are some things I
don't like from flower but for the most
part I love everything that I've ever
tried from flower beauty like they have
such great products and they're now sold
at Ulta which is so amazing go get those
points go buy this at Ulta get the point
system there don't buy it anywhere else
because I feel like it's just worth it
every product that you buy more than
likely you will be obsessed with
especially if it's like the powders
highlighters blushes lipsticks liquid
lipsticks lip glosses everything other
than N or two-faced products that I've
tried has been phenomenal since the lift
and sculpt contouring palette you have a
contour color a blush and a highlight
all very pigmented they look great on
the skin telling you these are good my
kind of orange hands and how do you get
any justice but they blend really well
very soft powders go in with a light
hand and you will be shocked okay so
four blushes I feel like my standout
products that I kind of had a love
affair with is the on estancia blushes
and I just started trying these out more
towards the end of 2017 but I quickly
became obsessed and I officially need
every single blush that anasazi has so
this little blush trio is what started
the love that I have with them this is
in peachy keen you see these colors
these colors are absolutely stunning
they're everything I want in a blush
palette like this blush palette right
here I will use everything in it you
know what I mean you can mix all these
colors together you can use just one
shade or the other it's a perfect size
for a compact you can travel with it
this one does have a little bit of
shimmer but it doesn't accentuate
texture if it looks fine just adds like
a little bit of glow to your skin and
then these two right here are mattes but
this is one of my absolute favorites I
love peachy tone blushes any kind of
warm tone blush will have my heart for
the most part and then
this one this one's so good to Anasazi a
blush kit in radiant so on this palette
I use these three shades right here
they're muted they're a little bit
darker they look really great on the
scan with pretty much any look I don't
use this one really ever because I don't
like Pink's like this but I like three
out of the four shades and I feel like
that's okay the palette is really
stunning these lasts a really long time
on your skin and they blend really well
so for drugstore I have a ton of blushes
like I have quite a bit and there's more
that I love that I just want to shout
out the brands and show you the ones
that I really enjoy so the first one is
again flower beauty and this is the
flower pots powder blush oh God as they
break it this one's in the shade peach
Primrose is actually one I'm wearing
today to kind of go with my warm tone
look and you look at this and think oh
that's really light but once you start
applying it to the skin it really gives
you that gorgeous peachy sheen on your
cheeks and it looks so beautiful
you're not really a blush person but
you're kind of trying to get into it
this is the perfect one to get because
it is a little bit more on the lighter
side so if you're like my skin tone and
lighter I think you love this maybe even
a little bit darker than Mays it just
adds that flush to your cheeks all the
flower pot blushes are great I'll see
use another one that's more pinky and
then there's another one that's mommy
and I use all of them and love them the
other blush that I love is you can tell
because the packaging is beat up is this
la girl blush and just playful again
this is one of those staple colors for
me goes with pretty much everything it's
like a nice neutral pink love this color
really good it doesn't last the longest
but it looks really great on the skin
and I feel like I could pile this on and
some days I just feel like piling blush
on for some reason and then blending it
out it's just how I am
so this is the perfect blush for that
because it's not too intense or anything
have this Ulta velvet blush in princess
cannot go wrong with this it is
absolutely beautiful it's that perfect
like tawny shade anyway I love this one
and then we also have Palladio blushes
Palladio makes really really great
blushes I love the matte blushes because
they're very pigmented again blend
really well these compacts are so slim
and easy to throw in your bag this is
the one in cheek this is one of the
newer ones that I've been using
recently that goes with absolutely
everything and then one that's more on
the choral side is this one and it is in
the shade toasted apricot and this one's
gorgeous for summertime Pilate Oh
blushes don't sleep on it Pilate is a
really great brand okay so next up we
have highlighters and of course I have
to shout out my spotlight palettes from
Smashbox this is my collab this year
with Smashbox and I loved these I can't
get enough of them
Perl was just one of my very top
favorite gold is so gorgeous -
especially in the summertime I've seen
gold on so many different deeper skin
tones and it just looks phenomenal I
love it this pie I'm telling you does
not accentuate your texture but it gives
you a gorgeous intense shine I've loved
seeing all of your photos throughout
this year wearing these palettes getting
them in the mail it's just been so fun
and you guys made this first Club really
special stay tuned because the fun is
not over and then another palette that I
really loved
is this Anasazi aglow kit this one again
it kind of fell in love with at the end
of last year I can't get enough of it I
feel like I've talked about this palette
so much since I've been using it like
the past few months just know I love it
it's one of my favorite palettes that
they have ever come out with for
highlighters and I think it is
absolutely beautiful it's what I have on
my face right now to give me the intense
shine that I have uh Nastasia glow kit
and sugar I highly recommend this one I
believe over any of the glow kids
because I have a few but this one is by
far my favorite drugstore had really
great highlighters this year again we're
gonna shout out flower beauty this is an
amazing highlighter it is these shimmer
and strobe highlighting palette and this
is intense you want a wet looking glow
this is the palette for you so I'm gonna
mix a little bit of this shade in this
Shane
and they're so pigmented if you're
wondering where this top is from
it's from my boutique do you see that
like you can't you cannot deny that glow
do you see that that right there is the
most intense highlighter I think I've
ever seen from the drugstore it is
beautiful on your face it looks really
beautiful it doesn't accentuate your
texture super bag it is obviously more
of that like shiny wet
look but to me it really doesn't
accentuate my pores I can bring it down
quite a bit but I mean on your body on
your face this is okay another one that
I really like this year is the
Maybelline master chrome metallic
highlighter if I had to pick one over
the other it would definitely be flower
beauty but this one still really is nice
for that gorgeous golden glow see if I
could do this on the other side of my
about a this one again super pigmented
as well but look I'm telling you this
was the year of drugstore makeup I don't
know why it said to use the smallest
brush every tool in the south I didn't
want to hear anyone complaining about
drugstore makeup not being good because
there's so much out from the drugstore
that is phenomenal and you just have to
try it you know or just watching two
videos let us find it for you and then
go pick up the good stuff hey I do want
to quickly say I did have another blush
product that I want to shout out and it
is just tart blushes this little pan
right here came out for the holiday
heart always has the best like blush
kits and this one was one of my
favorites they just have great blushes
the Amazonian clay ones lasts so long
I think I talk about them every year but
I just want to shout them out again
because one of my favorite companies for
blushes and this thing goes with me
everywhere moving on to eyeshadow
primers I only have a high end that
really stood out to me so I did fall in
love with the new high-end eye primer
this year and is the Smashbox
photo-finish lip primer this is what it
looks like it does have a tint to it
this one's in the shade light I believe
yes they have many different other
colors light is my favorite I make sure
to set it with powder if you don't and
you have oily eyelids you're gonna get
oily like if you go straight in with
this and then start putting in your
crease color I find that it will crease
but if you put this on set it with
either translucent powder your favorite
cream shade you'll be fine because it
will stay matte all day and I never have
a problem with creasing when I set the
primer so also it's good to set your
primer that way when you're blending in
your crease color it's nice and smooth
and doesn't get patchy and kind of drag
you know what I mean because the eye
primer is still sticky so make sure you
set it this one is really awesome I love
it and this thing is last to be forever
though for eyeshadow palettes I do have
a couple to share with you for high-end
so I do have this
for a pro warm palette I think this is a
really great palette so Ford did do a
really great job with these palettes
this one is my all-time favorite over
like the super colorful one and the cool
toned one just because I use these tones
all the time I think they're great they
blend really well they're very pigmented
there are a couple duds but for the most
part this isn't all around great palette
another one that is great to have in
your collection as like a staple palette
kind of one that you can use with any
eyeshadow palette if you're ever missing
transition shades highlight shades any
of that is this Tarte clay play palette
this is one that I feel like I have to
have just in case one palette is missing
a shade that I want this one usually
makes up for it so it is a all matte
palette which I love and you also have
some contour shades in here as well so
here they are again like I said they're
all matte you have a matte black and
matte warm brown you have some other
warm transition shades some highlight
shades you also have these bronzers that
you can use eyeshadow it's just an
all-around great matte palette that is I
feel like essential in a collection
because just has everything you need and
then the last one I want to mention is
Nina Tasha de Nona's sunset palette I've
also been really loving the green Brown
palette that I have from her but I
actually used it the other day
and for some reason I don't know if his
cause is old and expired but the colors
were not blending like I wanted have
this on right now and I I love the
colors but I feel like normally normally
would I look at I shout out pilots and
it says expired this day I'm like okay
but I really think repellents do expire
because a couple of mine have not been
the same um what's another one the star
palette that I have just doesn't blend
the same we designed the same
pigmentation just keep that in mind
these are very expensive palettes but
you could also find alternatives like
the Sephora pro warm palette to you know
make up for these colors but I do really
like this palette when I was using it
today I was like this is why I loved you
because you're so warm and beautiful do
you feel like they kind of lose their
gorgeousness after time be sure if you
use these palettes use them all the time
I have two that really I really love
like I said that Tarte one's really
great for kind of like if you're missing
shades and this one's that same exact
kind of thing but this one is the LA
girl eye Lux mesmerizing palette in the
shade
urban eyes this has all those colors
that you need and now does it have as
many as the tart one it doesn't have a
nice matte black but you do have really
great transition shades a highlight
shade and another color to really deepen
up the outer V or your crease whatever
you wanted to do so if you didn't want
to spend that much money on the Tarte
palette you could just buy something
like this because I do go to this all
the time as well and kind of dip into
the shades that you need and then the
star of the show this year when it comes
to drugstore eyeshadows is a hundred
percent this maybelline city mini
palette with Shayla collab this was balm
these colors in here are gorgeous they
are very pigmented to be honest there's
only like two different looks that I go
to with this palette because these
colors to means your speak smokey and do
a light eye with this just that's me
though y'all know I have a hard time
doing light eyeshadow looks I'm normally
like smokey or nothing at all but I love
these they're beautiful they blend
really well they're so pigmented so for
high-end eyeliners ink eyeliner from
Make Up For Ever is my favorite it is so
black so Matt it's one that you need in
your collection I have purchased so many
of these eyeliner this is a felt tip
eyeliner but it is more flexible it's
not a stiff felt tip at all and I really
like it it's a very very very intense
eyeliner that dries down pretty quickly
and again I love that matte eyeliner
look so this is a winner for me
drugstore liners for a stick eyeliner
and a liquid liner cuz I love both from
this brand
I love the Lottie London a.m. 2 p.m.
Kohl liner and liquid liner both very
pigmented I've been talking to you like
they're both very pigmented easy to use
and they're so good for drugstore
eyeliners you can get them at Ulta again
I'm on line at Ulta actually brows I
just have one product that I don't know
where it is right now because I've been
traveling so much but I'll include a
picture in this video and it's the
makeup revolution brow pomade it is my
favorite brow pomade and I don't know
where it is right now but I love it I've
almost gone through that whole little
jar that I have I think it is stunning
the blonde shade is perfect for me when
I'm blonde and when I'm like this color
it is the best so I have to mention for
glitters these Stila liquid eyeshadows
oh these are the way to go if you want
to do glitter on your eyes you
they're so intense so easy to apply the
dosa applicators freakin phenomenal this
gold goddess one is not doing justice
right now it's way better on your eye
but I don't know what's going on so this
is the applicator right there it kind of
has that rounded edge so it's really
easy to go in and carve out that crease
if you want to do a cut crease which is
what I normally do if I use these I'll
do just a little bit of a cut crease up
in here and then blend out my outer-v
my favorite favorite one is diamond dust
I think diamond dust is perfect it's
just this gorgeous like silver glitter
that one right now let's move on to lip
products this year
Smashbox liquid lipsticks stole the show
with their liquid lipstick formula I
don't know where I was going with that
but Smashbox liquid lipsticks are my
favorites even their new metal ones or
like metallic ones are so good because
they're formula doesn't dry out your
lips it looks really great on so this
shade that I have right here that I'm
showing to you is spoiler alert this is
one my favorite shades it's just so
unique see right there's like a Mavi
taupe color I love it they dry down
matte lasts a long time one of my
favorite lipstick formulas I mean I have
used so many of these dang lipsticks I
just can't get enough of it I will say
Mac's retro matte liquid lips are pretty
dang good - they're like a really close
second to Smashbox but Smashbox is my
ultimate favorite and then the Mac ones
lastly I want to shout out just two
little lip products from the drugstore
so we have the Jake at Beauty lip Finity
matte lip this is a kiss proof matte lip
so pretty the formula is really nice so
this is what it looks like right there
this one's in the shade hash honey and
it's just really nice I love it a lot -
my other favorite for the year for
drugstore has been the Palladio velvet
matte lip creams these are really really
nice very comfortable on the lips and
this raw silk color was my thing always
always always look at how pretty that is
