to be sharing with you my 2017 hair body
skin all of my favourites for my body
and my skin for 2017 and I have a ton of
products here I knew I couldn't include
them in my last video because they just
would've been way too much I mean I have
a lot of stuff here that's probably
gonna take just as long as the last 2017
favorites video did but um I asked you
guys if you wanted to see it and a lot
of you said yes so that's why I am
filming it for you today and I've got a
lot of great stuff things you probably
don't know that I love that I have in
here because I don't really talk about
these products too much especially once
I mentioned them one time and I continue
to use them don't normally go back and
mention it in another video you know
what I mean because I'm still using it
anyway so you'll see all my favorites in
this video things I've been using loving
what works for me if you guys are
interested to see all my favorites for a
body and hair in 2017 then let's just go
ahead and get started so the first thing
we're to talk about is skin care and
skin care is one of the most highly
requested things that you guys want me
to talk about you guys want morning
routines to see my skincare same with
nighttime routines and I know a lot of
you are super interested in knowing what
I use I have very sensitive skin I do
have rosacea I haven't worked to treat
that at all I'm actually a little
nervous because I've thought about doing
the laser to treat the redness but I've
also heard it kind of hurts I'm just a
little on the fence about it you know
and I kind of just embrace the rosacea I
mean can pretty much kind of like get
rid of it but I don't know it kind of
makes me who I am and I just I don't
mind it it doesn't bother me that much
to go spend a lot of money to get it
fixed right now you didn't know what my
skin was like underneath all this makeup
I do have rosacea I also have very oily
skin so these products were great for me
if you're sensitive I think that these
will be perfect for you they're really
gentle but get shit done first thing is
what I used to take off my makeup now I
go back to this every single time
because I think it is just the best
makeup remover ever ever I love this so
much I'm used it for the longest time it
is actually the Clinique take off the
day cleansing balm this is just so easy
to use and honestly I don't have to keep
going back with like makeup remover or
whatever to take off makeup this does
the job for me it really melts
everything down so what you'll do is you
take a little bit on your fingers rub it
together kind of warm it up turns into
like
this oily bomb and then you just rub it
all over your face and easily remove
your mascara all of those really hard to
remove products that we have so I love
this it takes it all off it really just
melts everything down it's just work so
well for me it's not harsh I can't take
a makeup remover wipe and rub it all
over my face to remove makeup that's
just too much for my skin and get super
irritated it's just it's just too much
so this is perfect I love it this is
honestly one of the best products I've
ever used and I will continue to
repurchase it because there has not been
anything that has been able to top it
begun to cleanser I have found a new
cleanser that I really really love and I
haven't mentioned it to you guys so I'm
gonna mention to you today
it's the Korres Greek yoghurt foaming
cream cleanser this is such an awesome
gentle cleanser this does get any extra
makeup buff it's just kind of like
lingering around but it also really
cleanses the skin really nicely leaves
my skin feeling soft it doesn't feel
stripped or anything of any oils and it
just works for me it's perfect my skin
doesn't get irritated its cleansed I
don't break out really I don't even
remember the last time I had a breakout
knock it on would I love this cleanser I
even bought the bigger size to keep in
my shower here and this is my travel
size and it's really great kind of feels
very luxurious as well so I highly
recommend checking this out definitely
get the smaller size if you just want to
try it out moving on to probably the
most expensive but necessary things in
my skincare routine that I absolutely
have to have every time I do my skincare
is drunk elephant drunk elephant is one
of my all-time favorite absolute
favorite brands that I know they're
expensive but I stand behind them
because they work they freaking work and
I mentioned them quite a few times but I
just want to say these two items right
here are must-have in your skincare I
think you cannot go wrong with these I
don't care what else you've got
get these products because they really
just help with your skin so this is a
really cool serum it's the C from a day
serum and it's too firm in Brighton and
I'm gonna read this little part to you
it says it dissolves unwanted surface
cells the result is diminished
appearance of UV photo damage and aging
replaced by incredible radiance and
luminosity I do notice that my skin has
a little bit more glow to it it just
looks a little bit healthier when I use
this product but don't use it and I just
go
moisturizer I just don't feel like it
works as well you know what I mean so I
love this product I think it's great I
think it helps me moisturizer really
sink into my skin as well
this just does work okay I did not think
I would be a serum kind of person but
now I play serum day and night and I
will not be without these two products
because they've just changed my life
so this one I use in the night time this
is the glycolic night serum this one is
really great I'm gonna read this really
quick too it says a high-tech aah a BH a
gel that resurfaces dull congested skin
by gently lifting away dead skin cells
dramatically improving the appearance of
texture uneven skin tone fine lines
wrinkles and pores the results are
greater clarity and luminosity
practically overnight let me tell you
this for your texture is phenomenal I
get some texture in here sometimes it is
ungodly like when I didn't take care of
our skin you could really tell I mean it
doesn't matter how good your makeup is I
thought that was the win but that was
just a plow it doesn't matter how good
your makeup is we're not taking care of
your skin your makeup isn't gonna look
as good as it could look you know what I
mean so I noticed the biggest difference
with this in applying makeup because my
texture has gotten so much better in
this area if I don't use this
I noticed more like dry patches this
really helps keep everything nice and
smooth my pores look smaller everything
just looks better it's a nice smooth
surface when I use this I can't be
without it I feel like if you had to
only purchase one I would go with this
one especially if you have texture or
problem areas that you really want
smooth down if you kind of just want
everything to be more balanced this is
the way to go this is really great
though if you want to firm and brighten
your skin so it's just up to you if you
won't both definitely get both but if
you could only get one I think this one
is amazing so this is my daytime
moisturizer is the Dermalogica active
moist and I really like this one because
it's oil-free it's lightweight and it
feels really good on the skin like it's
nothing that's too heavy it doesn't make
me greasy throughout the day like
interfering with any makeup you know
what I mean this is just one of my
favorites that I've gone through so many
bottles of this actually and I highly
recommend it if you have sensitive skin
this will probably be one of your
favorite moisturizers if you have oily
skin because it's still gonna add a lot
of moisture but it's not gonna be too
much - head
and it's not gonna make you greasy if
you have oily skin you do need to
moisturize no matter how much you think
you don't you definitely need to add
moisture back into your skin to try to
help balance things out and this is a
great one to have okay next up is an eye
cream this is the DNA do not age with
dr. Brandt's a triple peptide eye cream
this is so good I love this product it
is more on the pricey side I actually
got this in PR and I've been looking for
a really good eye cream because I just
couldn't find anything that really
moisturized that area like how I wanted
you know you know when you try different
eye creams and you're like oh this is
good but like it's not that good this is
good this is so moisturizing I actually
use this one day and night because I
found as I've gotten older even though I
have oily skin I do get a little bit
more fun I mean to flick you off I do
get a little bit more dry in this area
and I just really want to make sure I
take care of that especially I'm gonna
be putting on makeup I want to make sure
my under eyes are really nice and smooth
this is so nice when you first put it on
it's very cooling so it kind of like
deep puffs it really moisturizes that
area and I find that my fine lines are a
little bit more plumper you know what I
mean I really like this product I
especially love it for the coin effect
especially in the morning but this
moisturizes way better than any other
eye cream I've ever tried okay so for a
nighttime moisturizer I do like
something that's a little bit more
moisturizing a little bit more heavy
because it tends to work well for me and
my skin just really drinks it up so I've
been using this Korres well Rose 24-hour
moisturizing and brightening cream let
me tell you this is brightening I
sometimes use this on Christmas break
during the daytime because it wasn't
wearing makeup and I was like oh I
really want to add a lot more moisture
to my skin because I was feeling pretty
dry so I would apply this and my skin
was just glowing it looked so good this
is a really great moisturizing product
it's very very intense and that's why I
like it even though I have oily skin I
like to add as much moisture as possible
especially with skincare in the night
time I feel like that's the perfect time
to really add more moisture to your skin
even though it is a little bit heavier
by the way it smells like a spa even
though it is a little bit heavier it
doesn't break me out doesn't irritate my
skin which is perfect the last product
for my skin I would like to talk about
is the philosophy take a deep breath
night this is a gel bomb product so it's
really gonna stink and
to the skin very quickly if you're
wanting something that's not as heavy as
the Coors this is really great because
it's not that heavy but it is very very
moisturizing and it smells really good
mmm I love this one I love this so much
again you can't see but I am pretty far
down there this is great and since it
has more of that gel consistency this
sinks into the skin a little bit quicker
and it doesn't leave like any residue on
your skin so if you wanted to you could
totally use this during the day I've
done that a couple times especially if
I'm feeling really really dry in the
daytime and I want to put on makeup but
I don't want something this heavy and
something that needs to be a little bit
heavier than this I'll put on this one
because it does have that gel
consistency like I said so it stinks and
really quickly but it's very very
moisturizing it says it's an overnight
mask
I believe take a deep breath night I
don't know but I use it whenever I feel
like it okay let's move on to really
quickly self tanner you guys already
know I'm not playing any games with you
this year we have not changed one bit
still loving the loving tan Deluxe
bronzing mousse this is one of my this
this is my all-time favorite self tanner
there's nothing that tops it the tan
that you see now is loving tan it's the
best I just feel like it gives you the
most natural looking tan and makes you
really dark and I just can't go wrong
with ultra dark is my favorite the 8
hour one highly recommend it I'll leave
a code down below if you guys want to
use it for like a free mitts women
welcome to do that it is a quick dry
formula and it does give you more of an
olive color so that's why I love it it
does have a color guard you can see
where you're putting it the best lasts
so well on my skin just make sure you
stay moisturized especially like for the
winter time this is like with any
self-tanner though make sure you stay
very very nice and moisturized cuz
that's gonna prolong your tan and then
for face
I discovered this one this year the
Josie Maran Argan liquid gold
self-tanning face oil so I like this one
this one doesn't break me out but the
other oils that she has dust which I
don't understand why maybe because it
was so long ago when I tried it and I
was kind of like I don't want to try to
do more maybe that's the reason I should
probably try them out one more time to
see if they work for my skin because
it's been I think like a year or two 82
years since I've tried them but this is
a hydrating glow treatment and this
gives you a really nice color so you
have this little dispenser right here
and you just want to get some out and
then that's what it looks like right
there
I like to use saint-tropez has mini
tanning myths so they're specifically
like for your face that's what I like to
use so I'll put like four to six drops
and put it all over them self training
mitt and apply it to my face and it
gives a really nice natural glow it can
look a little orange if you apply too
much but if you apply just like the
recommended amount it looks really nice
it's really nice to have this one
because I don't use this one on my face
I feel like it's just a little too harsh
for me so that's why I have this one
this was actually sent to me in PR and I
think it's fantastic this does give me a
very nice self tan it doesn't last that
long on my face obviously because I
exfoliate and I cleanse my face all the
time so it kind of just does wear off
and you have to keep reapplying if I
have to use any makeup towelettes these
are my favorite they've been my favorite
for a while I just can't get away from
them so the Neutrogena makeup remover
cleansing towelettes
they are awesome I love this little blue
pack I don't really like anything else
other than this one I find it it works
really well for my skin and doesn't
irritate anything again I don't like
take all my makeup off every night with
this product but if I'm drunk if I'm
just too tired and I don't feel like
going to the sink to take my makeup off
oh you use these so if I just cleanse my
face and everything like that and I
still feel like I have a little bit
makeup like at my hairline I'll take
this and just clean up those areas
sometimes I don't bring my cleanser all
the way back 7-1 it in my hair let's
talk about two new deodorants that I
love let me tell you how hard is for me
to find a deodorant it is so freaking
hard I was using the secret clinical
strength deodorant
not necessarily for antiperspirant but
just because it always odor blocked so
well because I can my armpits can smell
okay I don't know if it was the secret
deodorant making it worse but I don't
know man when I tried to go to the
natural deodorant route it was just not
how I was not having it it was just
awful I could not do that detox that
everybody talks about I just can't do it
I wanted to try new deodorants and I got
these and I love them so I don't think
this one is as natural it could be wrong
but you know whatever I got this Donna
Karen cashmere missed one first off it
smells delicious and I do not stink with
this one this is awesome I keep this one
in my purse and I really like it a lot
it's an antiperspirant yeah I really
like the smell of it I think it smells
really good this had great reviews on
Sephora which is why I bought it
and I think it is a great product
ultimate favorite one is this one right
here this is the Korres it's a 24-hour
do dirt balloon M salts free paraben
free alcohol-free hyper allergenic no
marks I don't agree with that because
sometimes I get marks on my clothes I at
me because I apply a lot of this stuff
it's good for sensitive skin some of
this stuff I can't read I've used so
much of this stuff and it really doesn't
look like I've used any of it but I
promise I have I'm like down to here it
is a little rollerball and this just
works too it's lightweight it really
doesn't have a smell it's just it's good
you know you know when you just want to
apply deodorant you don't want to be
smelling it you just want it to like
work just not make you stink this does
that and I'm so happy too because this
is free of all of that bad stuff and I'm
just I'm really happy about it I really
like it a lot
I could commish it if I sweat from my
armpits you know what I mean I just
don't want to State I think it's really
great again
this is what it looks like I'll have it
down below in the description box but
again these two are my favorite
deodorants if you're trying to kind of
get off of like secret deodorants and
things like that you're having a hard
time these two it's out of both of these
get this one also I love this healthy
body wash it from love vanilla this is
the sport luxe cleanse shave or
vitalized so it's like a three-in-one
you can shave with it you can wash your
boss is an awesome awesome body wash I
went to repurchase it and it's sold out
so I need to go check it again because I
love this and I was so sad when I went
to go repurchase it that it was gone
but it's a sulfate-free sport body wash
that was created for an active life in
motion it's coconut oil infused it's
hydrating with rosehip and aloe and
delivers silky smooth shave bursting
with breezy freshness skin is left clean
soft and invigorated this has no harsh
chemicals it has a list of them all on
the back there this just works really
well for my skin doesn't dry anything
out and I can shave with it and it's a
comfortable shave it's not like one of
those products that says aw you can
shave with it it's dried you're dragging
your razor up and you're cutting
yourself left and right that one you can
actually shave with and it's really nice
love that if you're looking for a new
body wash I also love this one if you
love rose scent this is the body shop of
British rose this just smells so good
you can't shave with this one but not
too overpowering it's just fresh light
floral I love it you need it in your
life if you love roses
skincare products and I want to shout
out obviously you guys know I love this
so quick five-second mention lock seat
on ultra rich body butter has been
saving my skin this winter I have never
experienced dry skin like I have up here
in the North now because it gets so cold
this saves me honey I cannot be without
this product you just can't love this
repairs that dry cracked skin one of the
best moisturizers ever in the world oh
right let's get on to hair hair is a hot
topic around here I'm going to share
with you my blow-dryer I don't think
I've shared this with you guys ever I
think I shared it on snapchat that I
purchased this but never told you how I
feel at first I didn't know how I felt
until I started using this had to go to
a different hair dryer like when I went
to a hotel or something like that this
is so much better than any other hair
dryer I've ever used I feel like when I
first tried this out I didn't give it as
much credit as I should have because
this thing gets my hair dried in like
five to ten minutes it's insane it gives
me so much volume it is a lot of power
but it doesn't make my hair super
tangling or anything like that just make
sure you know you brush it out before
you start blow drying takes no time at
all which is great because I already
hate washing my hair not because I don't
like being clean but because I have to
blow-dry it and style it again this cuts
your blow-dried time in half highly
recommended okay and then new curling
wand a lot of people think I'm sponsored
by Drybar but I'm not I just really like
this curling wand gonna quickly mention
it because I mentioned it in the past
couple videos that you guys have seen
but I love this Drybar wand this is so
good I can't remember the exact name
again off the top of my head I had like
the Box sitting back for the longest
time so now I can't remember exactly
what it's called but it's the tapered
wand heats up really quickly it gives
you really gorgeous voluminous curls if
you want to see kind of like how I do my
curls I did it get ready with me where I
showed you so I will link that down
below I love it these curls last a
really long time you can do different
types of curls with this product as well
doesn't like dry out my hair make it
fried or anything like that and it curls
really quickly or shampoo and
conditioner I'm gonna insert some photos
here but I love the pure ology hydrating
line really makes my hair nice and
smooth it really cleanses it and
doesn't break me out on my back which is
a must-have for me I really love the
Bumble and Bumble invisible too but that
shampoo breaks out my skin so incredibly
bad I have found that out after using so
many tubs of that shampoo but this pure
ology one is great I think it's great
for my hair makes my hair really nice
and shiny so moving on dry shampoo this
has not changed one bit batiste dry
shampoo is by far my favorite it's
affordable from the drugstore you can
get it at Ulta get at Target and get it
wari this clean and light bear is one of
my favorite scents just because it
smells really good smells really clean
obviously because the name but I love
this so much even though it has a white
tint to it and I went darker with my
roots I don't care ok I make this work
and I kind of like a lighter root so I
don't know I think it works well for me
they also do have this brunette one
which is really nice as well if you have
really deep hair and you can't use one
with a white cast I would go for this
one because has a really nice tint to it
nobody's gonna know you have dry shampoo
in your hair because you can't see it
alright let's talk about some
texturizing spray that I really loved
this year I'm just gonna shout out a few
the living proof full dry volume I
really like this one as a lot of volume
nice texture that we also have this igk
Beach Club texturizing spray which is so
good I feel like this one gives you the
most grit out of all three so if you
want something that is a little bit more
gritty you might like this one the best
it also smells really freakin good so if
you're looking for something that's
really gonna give you that texture give
me some PC looking hair that's the way
to go it kind of feels like a
lightweight hairspray to me not crunchy
or anything but it has that texture to
it I really like this one gives you that
beachy looking hair smells so good again
this one's from igk and how pretty this
packaging is then again this one just
feels really nice in your hair it's the
perfect texture finishing spray I like
to use this like all over I'll flip my
hair over and just bring this all over
as well just really love the volume of
that this gives it just works well so
love all of these I would say the eye GK
is probably my favorite you're looking
for something that's more lightweight
not too gritty filling I would go for
these two
because they're really nice and then
another product that I use after the
shower this is actually from my hair
stylist she gave this to me a long time
ago and I've been using it ever since
it's the label dot M professional hair
care is the diamond dust leave-in cream
this makes your hair so soft this is the
only thing I use after I get out of the
shower on my hair I used to use so much
other stuff but this is the only thing I
use now ever since she gave this to me
and I swear to you it makes your hair so
smooth so soft smells really good I
don't know where you can get this is
good and I believe like all the high-end
stylists use this or something I don't
know but it's real fancy and I like it
and I'm grateful that she let me have
this so again this is like one of those
after you shower before you blow-dry
product or almost done last but not
least I'm gonna mention to you three
perfumes that are the best perfumes of
2017 / 2016 because I believe I use some
of these in 2016 as well
first - I believe I used in 2016 are
Gucci Guilty I feel like this is a
staple love it is pretty intense so if
you don't like intense perfumes you
might not like this but it's good this
is like the only non floral perfume that
I really really really love and this
lasts on my skin for so long so I highly
recommend this I feel like it's a staple
pretty dang sure I use this in 2016 - I
could be wrong but I don't even know I
don't even know if they sell this
anymore but I'm telling you this is the
best now there's a bunch of different
florists by Gucci cuz I got this wrong
the first time I purchased this I got
like the kind of pink tint liquid this
one is the blue green liquid okay
I hope they still have this on sale but
I'm telling you this is the best
smelling perfume ever it smells so good
again this is flora by Gucci and then
the last one I want to recommend is one
that I have almost used up and I never
ever use up perfumes and that's the YSL
mom Perry perfume I even have the box
right here of my new one ready to go
whenever I finish the other one up this
is just a great perfume again it lasts
really well I always get compliments my
red is perfume always no matter what
I've got compliments and meeting grieves
I've gotten compliments from random
people on the streets everybody loves
this perfume and I get it this is more
of like a warmer scent very inviting
just smells really good so love these
these are my top three perfumes I think
you need them in your life hopefully
they still have this one for sale
because everybody needs this watch so
that is it for my 2017 like body's skin
care all my favorites for the year there
was a lot again this is probably another
really long video you stayed till the
end just true love and I appreciate you
thank you so much hope you guys enjoyed
this I had so much fun filming it for
