today we are going to be reviewing and
talking about this expensive at palette
it's beautiful but it's 239 dollars I
compare this to two other high-end
palettes that I have at least the most
high in the eye I'm pretty sure that
I've purchased I'm going to be swatching
it telling you the differences tell you
what I like what I don't like and if you
should purchase this or not so do you
want to see some details about this
palette then let's just go ahead and get
started I purchased this palette a few
weeks ago because I was on Sephora and
as I was just browsing through Sephora I
saw this palette and I was like oh my
god that looks gorgeous and then I saw
the price tag and I was like is it made
from gold like I don't I don't
understand the price of this so this is
the Natasha de Nonna green brown palette
there's two palettes like this there's
the green brown and then there is the
purple blue palette I knew I would get
more use out of the green brown so
that's the one that I purchased comes in
this white package like this her name is
embossed on the palette and there's some
zeros here which I don't know what that
means I haven't really looked too deep
in this palette I've just done a little
bit of research don't hate me for it you
open it up and then you have a nice
mirror right here you have this little
slip with the names on it and then you
have your shades as you can see I have
been using this palette a lot this has
been pretty much my main palette that
I've used these past couple weeks if
you've seen me wear a really glittery
eye something really smoky dramatic I
actually did do a tutorial with this
which I will link down below and also
right here I've just been wearing the
hell out of this product just because I
want to test out a bunch of different
eyeshadows see what I was feeling and
just everything like that so I believe
this little thing there's like little
indentions right in here where you could
just rip it out but I like to keep it
because these shadows do have some
fallout so I like to keep it that way
the mirror stays a little bit more clean
and it's not going to get completely
messy here on the front part of the
palette I wrote some stuff down that see
me looking down this where it is there
are 28 shades in this palette and there
is points 0 8 ounces per
shadow and that's more than the marc
jacobs was there is a total of 2.2 six
grams now these other two pallets that
i'm going to compare them to this is the
marc jacobs pallet this is the about
last night pallet this is a
limited-edition pallet and there are
only 20 shades in here at point three
ounces point zero three ounces there's
less product in less shades in this
palette than a Natasha de nada pallet
and it's one hundred and thirty nine
dollars cheaper and then for the visor
pallet this is the next expensive one
after the Marc Jacobs one that I have
there are only twelve shades in here but
you do get point 84 ounces and they have
a ton of different shades of this kind
of pallet I picked this one just because
I love the colors of it and all that but
let's just move on so first I took this
to New York with me it's really travel
friendly in my opinion I just put it in
my little makeup bag and I took this and
my Naked basics palette just in case I
wanted to use more matte shades a couple
things I feel like this palette is
missing every time I go into this
palette and do a look with it I always
always always need a black now that
could be just me some people might not
need a black you might just be fine with
this dark brown which is perfectly fine
I have the dark brown smudge on my lower
lash line and it is beautiful but I love
deep looks with palettes like this if
it's really dramatic and fun I need a
black to have some fun make something a
little bit more smoky or whatnot I think
a matte black and a matte Brown is kind
of like an essential in a palette um I
feel like that's missing in here and
another thing that I wish was in here
that it's not a deal-breaker for me but
I just wish it was in here is a lighter
warm Brown just a matte warm Brown
transition shade this transition shade
is really gorgeous but it's more of like
that
orange brown kind of color a little bit
more on the red orange side and it is
beautiful but sometimes I don't want to
use this as my transition shade if I'm
using this silver right here you know
what I'm saying so I find that I have to
go to different palettes like I've been
going to my original Laura Pro palette
for a couple shades for the most part
I've just used this entire thing and one
thing I really want to say is that these
are so incredibly pigmented and they are
so easy to blend you probably clicked on
this video thinking I was gonna talk mad

it which it is super expensive but this
is such a fun palette to work with it is
so easy to blend when there are shades
like this that are really glittery
really intense you need something that's
going to blend really well and these are
it I don't think I have played with this
much shimmery eyeshadow in such a long
time because it's hard to find something
that looks beautiful and then it's just
easy to work with I also love how
there's kind of like groupings of
different shades and you could kind of
see in the palette how they kind of
grouped together like these two group
together these three are great together
and then these two are great together
which i think is really awesome just
seems like they're grouped in a way
where it's kind of easy to tell if
you're just purchasing this palette and
don't know what shades to use with what
they're kind of just sectioned off
together to where you can see like this
shade will it go with this one and you
know you can create different looks with
each column so I really do like that my
all-time favorite shade in this palette
is this gem right here I think every
single time I've done a look with this
palette I have incorporated this color
into my look I currently have it right
in the inner corner and blending it out
onto the lid and I just love it it is
beautiful now there is a ton of fallout
with this product it is definitely more
of a glitter eyeshadow but there is a
nice base to it so it's not just like a
random glitter eyeshadow it has a nice
base with a ton of glitter which I
appreciate the one just take a little
swatch you can see how kind of chunky it
is right there I'm sorry for my nails by
the way you can kind of see how chunky
it is but once you blend it out or put
it on your lid it is absolutely stunning
but that's what it looks like right
there it is just so beautiful the one
thing that I love about this palette is
it makes me want to use color and try
out different things that's what I love
the most about it like I'm not usually
into like green browns or iridescent
colors but this palette makes me want to
play with them and this palette makes it
fun because it's so easy to use another
one of my favorite colors is this one
right here I have this one all over my
lid and it is just stunning this is
definitely more of a shimmer it has a
little bit of glitter in it but it's
definitely more on the shimmer side when
you see this one up close with the other
one you'll see the texture
different can kind of see the top one
has a little bit more texture a little
bit more chunky glitter in there and the
bottom one is definitely more of a
shimmer so that's the difference between
those two or me the only shadow that
really like stands out as like glitter
is my favorite one right here the rest
of these are more of like a shimmer with
like a little bit of glitter but not
that chunky at all the mats are
beautiful they're very very pigmented
and very easy to blend their couple
right there again there's not a lot of
mattes I also love this matte pink shade
to set my whole lid with before I go in
with eyeshadow and this little mid-tone
mauve is gorgeous as well they're very
pigmented they're just stunning look at
that they're just they're so pretty when
I put my brush into this palette I don't
have to dip multiple in multiple times I
can just go in one or two times and I
can have the amount of color that I want
because it has such great pigmentation
now one thing I do recommend this is
kind of like my personal preference you
don't have to do this but I feel like if
you want to go the extra mile and make
sure everything stays locked in with the
shimmer and the glitter in this palette
I would definitely use a glitter
adhesive
I love the Too Faced glitter glue is
just one of my favorites and whenever I
do a full-on shimmery lid like this I
always put that down first and then put
whatever shimmery color on top just to
really make sure it's locked in I don't
get fallout throughout the day or
anything like that I love this as a brow
bone highlight I think it's absolutely
beautiful it is what I have on right now
very very easy to blend this is
definitely a palette that you can use
year-round it's absolutely stunning I
mean these golden shades are gonna be
beautiful in the summer time and just
doing like a nice blown out golden smoky
I'll just be gorgeous and then like
these greens and all of this right here
and these like plums on this side are
stunning for fall and winter or even in
the summertime I mean honestly do you
think if I want to wear a vamp you look
in the summertime I'm gonna wear I'm
just very passionate about this palette
because I've been really enjoying it and
I think it is awesome now I will say if
you are not into color if you're not
into shimmery eyeshadows if you're just
not into experimenting with your look I
would pass on this because it is so
expensive and it's probably not
something you're going
use every single day but for me it's
kind of like one of those staple palate
no palate on the top of my head that I
can think of that really stands out to
me tops this for the shimmery eyeshadows
I will say maybe the lorac palettes kind
of a right up there you know they are
really great they're really nice and
pigmented and the lorac palettes you get
how many do you get I have my lorac Pro
right here you get 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16
you get 16 shades in this and I believe
it's like 30 40 dollars I don't know
maybe 50 I don't I've had this forever
do you see this you see how big at this
thing in but these laurent palettes are
really great if you don't want to go for
a natasha de Nona and spend that money
there are multiple palettes from lorac
they have different color schemes for
like each palette they have a rose one a
cool tone one and then this one which is
more warm toned let me show you a little
comparison of the shimmers so I'm going
to take lit bronze or whatever this is
called
even feeling this shimmer eyeshadow like
it is really pretty this is a very
pretty shimmery eyeshadow if you compare
this one with the lorac one it's
completely different it's just
completely different you see what I'm
talking about
like it shines but it does not shine
like the natasha de no no one I'm going
to take another color that's kind of
similar in this palette I'm going to
take we'll just do this one we'll do
this one right here oh it's so different
it is so different look at that that is
stunning that's why this makes it so
much fun and then when you start
blending it out it's just so easy to do
like look at that honestly I cannot say
enough good things about this palette I
really really enjoy it I think it is
absolutely amazing and I hundred percent
think is worth the money it is one of
those things that I would ask for for
Christmas so again if you're not really
into shimmery looks experimenting with
your colors anything like that you might
want to pass on this palette because
that's basically what this palette is
all about it's just playing with these
colors having fun with it coming up with
different looks and everything like that
cuz you can do so many things with this
palette again I just wish you had those
two other shades or at least a matte
black in here because I just
really need one I really need one for
this ballot but that's pretty much all I
have to say about it I hope this isn't
for as informative as I was hoping it
would be I was really hoping to try to
make this as informative as possible
because this is the most expensive
pallet I've ever used I have used a
pellet by I think it was by Terry if you
watched my last luxury make a pot was
like a thousand dollar makeup haul
I used that palette and it was
absolutely terrible like if you put that
thing up against this there's no
comparison I hope you enjoyed this video
I hope it was informative let me know
what you think in the comments like is
there ever a pallet worth almost 300
dollars in your opinion after tax and
everything like that definitely let me
know what you think I want to hear your
thoughts and if you have any suggestions
on other palettes that I should try out
or expensive items let me know down
below in the comments I'm definitely
harsh on my luxury makeup purchases the
ones I spend a lot of money on it's a
lot of money you know and not everybody
else's then that kind of money on some
makeup you know you could buy a hell a
nice outfit for this thank you guys so
much for watching don't forget to Like
