match that I got my glam bag phone and
tweezers what's the weather like right
now it's super gloomy and if you know
anything about my videos you know that I
rely on like natural lighting for my
stuff and then that's why I like it's so
kind of darker I guess because it's just
gloomy outside right now do you drive

up at 6:50 super late what's the last
wendla's last time you showered I

movie you saw if we were talking about
theatres I honestly don't know I haven't
been to like the theaters and forever
but me and my fiance watched a maybe
last night called brothers if you've
ever ever seen it it is amazing is it
not and if you haven't seen it you
really need to see it it's about um like
this soldier being deployed and uh he
comes home like super crazy because he
was a powa and all the sudden stuff but
is such a good movie I was so like oh
really deep and just like moves you it's
so sad
so I don't know just a lot of emotions
Ellen what does your last text message
say oh it's already unlocked hold on
thank you um what's your ringtone my
ringtone is Five Finger Death Punch and
it's the songs far from home
I love Five Finger Death Punch I don't
know if you guys know that about me but
I really do love them they are one of my
favorite bands and
other band I love is disturbed so I'm
more of a rock kind of girl um then like
country and stuff like that like I like
a few country songs but I'm more of a
rock person and I would much rather
listen to that any day even though I am
from the south but I don't know I just I
like it better huh I like the feeling of
like I don't know I just like it um have
you ever been to a different country no
I kind of like my little States you know
my little country in the US you know do
you like sushi i love sushi i could live
off sushi i'm not a big fan of the fried
stuff but i really really loved like the
raw fish sushi is like salmon and like
with some cream cheese in it oh so good
where do you buy your groceries if i buy
food it's usually at walmart cause
that's usually the cheapest but like
makeup and stuff i buy everywhere I've
noticed that walmart is cheaper though
um but I like to go to CVS a lot and if
you follow me on Twitter you know cuz
I'm like I'm gonna save you guys money
yes they go like all the time have you
ever taken a medication help you fall
asleep faster unless you want to count
nyquil then no not really how many
siblings do you have
I have one half sister and one half
brother and I don't live with them I
never have but we're all related do you
have a desktop computer laptop I have a
laptop this big sucker right here um how
will we be turning on your next birthday
I will be at 21 so yay
do your contacts or glasses I don't wear
any of it do you color your hair okay I
get this question so many times if I
have a hair video like my hair tutorial
I did like this kind of hair by the way
if you want to see how to get this all
day care right here I'll like the
tutorial but oh my get ready with me
it's kind of a faster version of how I
do it but um I don't color my hair okay
and I go to my stylist and I she gives
me a halo which is just this top part of
my hair and she just straight bleach
okay it's just straight-up bleach and
that's how I get my blonde but it's not
like the whole top layer is floral
because I still have brown like down in
here and stuff and every now and then
I'll get low lights but you see kind of
like the brown so all the ground is my
natural hair color and it's like the
most healthiest do but um that's what I
do for my hair like I don't touch it
that's all I do
the Browns that show the blonds leech
and that's it so hope that answered a
lot of y'all's questions maybe I should
put like 25 questions plus hair color so
people will know like my hair color I
get so many questions on it um I lost my
point there we go tell me something
you're planning to do today film some
videos edit and then I'm going on a date
with my fiance and I have a hair bow in
my eye and this hair is getting on my
nerves too and I know people hate it
when I touch my hair but I don't know
how many times I have to say that I
cannot help it sorry um when was last
time we cried I cried today somebody
called my fiance actually what my
friends called my fiance and told him
that my brother was in the was nice to
you because he got a car accident and I
freaked out
um my fiance called me told me and I was
like oh my freaking out like I literally
was just crying and stuff I was upset
turns out it was his best friend that
was the exact same name like he has
exact same name as him and it's his best
friend so it was all a big confusion so
I mean I feel bad for him but I thank
God wasn't my half-brother um what is
your perfect piece of topping I don't
really like a lot of pizza toppings but
if I have to have something it's like
cheese bell peppers and like sausage or
something I don't know I like kind of
just having bread in the sauce I know
that's super weird but I really like
that um which do you prefer hamburgers
or cheeseburgers cheeseburgers have you
ever had an all-nighter I think it's a
stupid question to ask somebody like of
course who hasn't had an all-nighter if
you ever had an all-nighter let me know
down below what's your eye color is
brown brown brown brown and can you
taste the difference between Pepsi and
Coke oh my gosh yes oh I hate
Patsey I literally hate Pepsi tastes

favorite but I don't like regular cokes
I only drink diet coke literally the
only two drinks I drink our diet coke
and water and I'll drink fuses every now
and then and if I drink that what kind
do I get the peach kind but I'll drink
so much tight coke I know I'll be like
it's so bad for you

kind of caffeine or I would be like a
crazy blonde witch or something like it
