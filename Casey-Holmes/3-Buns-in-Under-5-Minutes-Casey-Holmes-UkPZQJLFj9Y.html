on three buttons that are under five
minutes apiece each bun took me less
than five minutes to do and they're
great for if you're running late or
going to work and you just don't have
time to do your hair or if you're like
me our buns almost everyday work messy
bun sock buns anything like that I wear
them all the time to work and has time
my hair is like 2 or 3 days old so this
is great for second day hair or when you
don't want to really wash it you don't
time so this is all around a braid
tutorial just go ahead throw a quick bun
up make it look cute and then go out the
door I have the traditional soft bun I
have a braided bun and then I have this
top knot that I'm wearing now which is a
lot quicker than the last top knot video
I did so I think you guys liked this one
if you guys also want me to do a summer
hairstyle tutorial without some really
cute yourself that I've been seeing a
lot lately that I want to recreate so if
you want to say that then just like this
video and I will work on that for you
but I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and I will see you in my next
video alright ladies so let's see
started the first one is going to be the
sock bun this one is one of my favorites
and I just thought if they I would go
ahead and show you guys so I'm starting
off the second third day hair it's
pretty old
and what I'm doing is finger combing my
hair back keep in mind if you want your
buns a lot more perfect than just comb
your hair back with a brush totally up
to you I like to fear me over comb it
back and then touch up any spots with
the brush and kind of have it a little
bit messy that's just how I like it
so I'm going to make sure I have all my
hair tucked in the back and the ponytail
and I'm going to take the brush and just
get the sides just make sure there's not
a lot of really huge bumps in it and I'm
going to tie this ponytail bit pretty
high up on my head because I want the
sock bun to sit pretty much right on my
crown so I'm just going to take my hair
tie and tie that baby in place and I
loop this around about three times just
so I know it's nice and secure
all right so after we've got the pony
pull through I'm just going to brush the
ponytail out just so it's not super
knotted up and I'm going to be using a
little donut like this I got mine from
Claire's you can use the sock I used to
use a white sock when I had first
started doing this and it worked really
well so whatever you want to do is up to
you I think these are about three or
four dollars at Claire's pretty
inexpensive and I'm just going to start
kind of Midway with my pony because I
have so many layers going on that
sometimes it's hard to tuck all of the
hair in and get it all in the bun so you
just want to take your hair and just
start pushing it into that donut and
just roll it down and once you start
rolling it down and just pushing pieces
under and rolling it you will definitely
feel it come together and this does take
some practice to get it down right but
once you do you'll be good to go it
still takes me kind of a couple times to
get the way I want it but just keep
remember - tucking in those pieces and
rolling it down at the same time and
you'll feel it kind of come down and
secure to your head so this is what it
looks like after you secure it all down
and I'm just going to tuck in pieces
that were kind of bothering me and it's
just a super easy look like how can you
go wrong with this it looks so good even
if you're super casual this just spices
up any outfit
okay so the next is a braided bun this
is a fun one to do if you kind of just
want to add some different texture to
your bun and it's really easy to achieve
so I'm just splitting my ponytail into
sections and I'm going to braid both of
these sections all the way down as far
as you can if you can't fit all of your
hair like braid it all completely down
to the bottom that's okay because we're
going to be tucking it under the bun
anyway so just go ahead and tie it all
the way down and what we're going to be
doing is securing it with a plastic hair
tie if you have darker hair like me I
would suggest the darker little hair
ties like that but the clear ones work
as well so you can use whatever you have
and I'm just going to secure this in
place and do the same thing on the other
side
after you've got those braided you want
to go ahead and just tug the braid to
kind of loosen it up and make it a
little bit more full you don't have to
do this but it's just what I wanted to
do for a fuller bun up at the top with
the green that was turned into a habit
thanks for the look and every single
view I love this life and it's all
because of you then you're going to take
whichever braids you prefer I'm going
counterclockwise taking the one braids
going over and I'm making the other one
follow it around so they're kind of just
spinning around each other like that and
you'll see it just creates a really easy
bun and once you start seeing the
plastic thing when you get towards the
end that's when you just want to tuck it
right underneath that other braid just
like I'm doing right here and then you
want to bobby pin that in place just to
make sure you can't see it and again you
do want to bobby pin the ends of your
hair that is not Brighton underneath
this bun just to go ahead and conceal
that so again I just bobby pin it and
I'm going to wrap this other one right
around it as well and I'm also going to
tuck this right underneath the bun and
bobby pin it in place
and then after you've pinned it all up
you can just tug it pull it make it
bigger whatever you want to do and then
your completed with your braided bun
everything you wanted that you asked
like your wife because I'm finally doing
something working believe in my wiki
mixtape the last one is going to be a
top knot this is a super easy look as
well takes probably two minutes I'm
going to take my hair out of this
braided bun and if you're just starting
from the beginning go ahead and get your
hair up into the high ponytail but do
not tie it with a hair tie yet we're
going to tie it here in just a moment so
after I take my hair tie out I'm going
to just twist this hair all around and
you just keep twisting and you'll see
that it kind of forms its own bun and it
looks really cute and just you know
messy which is how I like it so I just
keep twisting it and then you'll see
this part of hair on the end right there
it's about four to five inches I'm going
to lay it over the bun and then we're
going to secure the bun in place with a
hair tight you can use as many as you
want depending on if you have really
thick hair if you have fine hair it's
just up to you and some of the pieces
might come out a little bit so just
bobby pin them down or tuck them in and
just play with it you can make it bigger
smaller whatever and this is a super
easy look it really doesn't take any
time at all and you could pull some
pieces down beside your face just to add
to the messiness a little bit and that's
pretty much it so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you in
my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
