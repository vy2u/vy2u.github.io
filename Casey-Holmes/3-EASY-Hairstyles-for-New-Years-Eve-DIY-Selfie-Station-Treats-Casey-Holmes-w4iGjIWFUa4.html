a different kind of video I know a lot
of you wanted me to do a DIY for
Christmas but I kind of just I got
started late in the summer and I
couldn't do a lot of DIY decor so I
figured New Year's is coming up and
Year's Eve and I would do a video for
you guys I'm going to show you three
hairstyles that are really easy to get
at home and I also used a really
affordable brand I got these at CVS and
they smell good and I'm running on like
third day hair so I had to use a couple
products in me cuz I know I've mentioned
a lot of high-end stuff to you guys but
I want to show you that you can also get
great results at the drugstore as well
so you'll be seeing these babies in
action they're my favorite trust me it's
like one of my favorite lines at the
drugstore I'll show you guys three
hairstyles a DIY selfie station because
let's be real you can't have a party
without a selfie station
who's gonna where you gonna take
pictures at it's just a fun little thing
so a DIY selfie Shea station and then
I'm gonna show you guys two snaps that
you can make their really easy ones just
cupcakes but I'm not a big Baker and if
you're like me and you don't really bake
a lot and you kind of have a hard time
cooking then this is for you
my cupcakes turned out a little brown
but they still taste good I think so I
made the cupcakes and then I also made
something that's really easy to make
that you can make like within ten
minutes and just put it in the fridge
let it harden for a couple hours and
then you'll be good to go I really hope
you guys enjoy this video this is just a
really fun and easy thing to do if
you're at home for New Year's Eve and
you have some friends over and you could
just have a little fun time so thank you
guys so much for watching and let's go
ahead and jump on into the video okay
let's start off with hair these are the
three super easy looks I'll be showing
you guys today so first off let me show
you my crazy hair this is like three
days old it's not cute so I'm gonna go
ahead and take this dry shampoo from
Tresemme this is going to help refresh
the hair and I love this because it just
smells so good as well so it helps take
care of the oil but it smells amazing
like I haven't smelled a dry shampoo
like this and forever
I had to spray it all over hahaha so
then I'm gonna take the estimated
thermal creations this is
just the thermal spray it's gonna help
protect your hair from the heat because
I am going to curl my hair again then
I'm just gonna brush my hair out it's a
really painful experience but I got
through it and I survived
so hallelujah for curls I'm just gonna
do alternating curls so I'm gonna do one
curl away from my face the next one
towards my face I'm just gonna alternate
them I've been doing my hair like this
lately and I love it because it creates
a ton of volume so after you're done
this is what the hair should look like
and then I'm going to just sit there and
shake it out and love the fact that I
have long hair and then take my fingers
and just shake everything out and then
also I will run a brush through through
it just to smooth everything and make
sure it doesn't look too unruly so you
can either leave your hair like this
which is what I usually do I would just
top it off with this hairspray which is
also from Tresemme it's the 24 Hour Body
keeps your hair in place all day and it
does not feel crunchy which I love so
I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys the
first hairstyle if you didn't want to do
just a plain old curly hairs hairstyle
and you're just gonna take the hair on
the sides of your head whichever side
you prefer and you could just twist it
back and bobby pin it and just pull your
hair up on the sides just to kind of add
some volume and it's a really easy way
just to spice up your hair salt without
having to do anything too crazy so I
love this creates a lot of volume and
then the next one we're just going to
keep our hair like that and then put the
rest of it back into a ponytail but
don't tie it into the ponytail just yet
I'm going to make sure my hair goes all
the way in the back and then basically
what we're gonna do is we're just going
to twist the hair just like so and we're
gonna twist it into a low bun it's just
gonna be a messy low bun I really love
the way this one turned out it looks
super elegant but it takes no time at
all so after you twist it up you just
want to put a hair tie in around it and
then just pull it out a little bit and
loosen it up and then all I did was
bobby pin to my bangs into place just so
they didn't fall throughout the night
and then you have a really easy semi
elegant hairstyle so if you want to do
this while you're at home you totally
could I think it's really really cute
and a great way to keep your hair out of
your face all night
then the last one is another one of my
favorites and we're going to go ahead
and take our hair completely down then
we're gonna take our hair all to one
side I'm just gonna use the side that I
have all my bangs on and I'm gonna leave
a few hairs out in the front of my face
and basically what we're gonna do is
we're gonna kind of twist this section
back and then we're going to tie it like
a low ponytail and this is a very very
loose ponytail it's just gonna add a
little bit of messiness to it so
basically you want to part your hair and
then throw your ponytail into that hole
and kind of throw it back and this just
gives a more elegant look as well I
really like it a lot I bobby pin these
pieces on the side of my face back and
then I did tease the bottom and it just
gives a fun flirty look and I think
taking your ponytail and flipping it
inwards really helps add a little bit of
extra something something to the whole
look moving on to the selfie station I
just took a little nook in my apartment
just wherever there was a little bit
more room so I'm gonna head and took my
C down and I got these little door
fringe things from Party City I
purchased two of them just so it
wouldn't be too sheer and I went ahead
and just pinned one up and then I pinned
the next one a kind of off-centered with
it so that it would fill in the spaces
that the other one had you can see I'm
kind of struggling here too it was kind
of hard work to pin these in then I'm
gonna take it this little light ball I
thought this was a strand of lights but
no it was just one little ball so I
figured hey why not have it in the
center of the whole thing so it's kind
of like the ball that drops you know in
New York or whatever yeah I like it
and then I took a strand of lights and
just draped them around the rest of it
and it just added a fun little look and
I love how it just lights up and this is
a perfect place to take selfies it looks
super super cute especially at night
this is literally what I do when I'm
filming like I just I have issues
a picture of your selfie in your little
selfie nook I would love to see it now
next up we're gonna show you the
cupcakes and this little dark chocolate
bark that I made I guess that's what you
would call it and first off I'm going to
show you the dark chocolate thing this
is perfect for people that can't really
cook well I like myself and I'm taking
this Baker's chocolate is the real dark
chocolate and I'm just gonna heat it up
and I love this because it's so
convenient it's already in a pot all you
gotta do just put it in the microwave
and follow the instructions until it's
melted so then I'm going to put a piece
of wax paper down and just spread this
chocolate all the way out I used about
one and a half of these little Baker's
cups and it gave a really nice chunky
layer it wasn't too thick but it wasn't
too thin to where it wouldn't hold its
shape and then I just went ahead and
sprinkled it with a bunch of different
things these little pearl sprinkles
little grey sprinkles whatever you want
to top this thing with you feel free to
do it you can customize this to whatever
you want it to be I just added a little
bit of white chocolate bites on top as
well and it just added a little
something extra to it so after you are
done with that you're just gonna want to
stick it into the fridge for a few hours
or overnight would be best and then once
it's hardened all you gotta do is break
them up and you have little dark
chocolate bites after that we're gonna
make cupcakes and I just got this little
Betty Crocker mix at my store and had
super easy instructions you only needed
three things so that's why I chose it
you can use whatever you want and I'm
just making cupcakes and I know it's not
anything like super interesting or
different but I feel like cupcakes are
staple and everybody seems to really
love cupcakes so they're easy to use at
a party because they're individual and
somebody can just pick one up instead of
having to like cut a cake or anything
like that so I got these cute little
cupcake things I don't know what you
would call them but I got them at Party
City I just got the grey and black ones
to go along with the theme of New Year's
which is usually grand black and then I
just poured all of my batter into those
about halfway and then I cooked them at
350 degrees for about 40 minutes and
I kind of overcooked mine but ain't no
thing
they were still pretty good then I'm
taking this Betty Crocker whipped
frosting this is the buttercream one and
I'm just going to top off my cupcakes I
am NOT a cupcake decorator obviously but
I did the best I could and then I'm
gonna add some toppings on top and then
you are done with your desserts so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video enjoy
