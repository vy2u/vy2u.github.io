tutorial on three different looks that
you can use when you're ever you're
running on second third or fourth day
hair I've had a lot of requests for this
video so I figured I'd sit down today
and film it for you hopefully you can
find a hairstyle that you would want to
try out and if you do don't forget to
send me a picture I'll leave all my
links down below and I hope you guys
enjoy this video
okay so obviously if you're running on
second third or fourth day hair
sometimes you need a dry shampoo I know
I do because I have very oily hair and
I'm using the batiste dry shampoo this
one's the hint of color for deep dark
brown hair I love this one if you have
really dark hair I highly recommend it
it doesn't leave a white cast in your
hair anything so I'm just spraying this
all over where it's really oily and then
rubbing it in and then I'm going to
spill it to my hair in half and brush
out the hair so we can get all the
tangles out and also any excess dry
shampoo
and yet at this point I was seeing how I
looked with the middle part and I kind
of wasn't feeling it what do you think
let me know ok so for the first
hairstyle we're going to take everything
to the side I'm taking it all to my
right-hand side and I'm going to act
like you know how when you're a girl and
you kind of flip your hair over that's
basically what you're doing you're just
kind of flipping your hair over so
you're going to have a really nice deep
side part and you can do this on any
side the left or the right and I'm just
going to drag all my hair around and we
are going to use these elastics which
are dark so they're great for dark hair
because if you use clear elastics on
dark hair you can really see them I'm
just going to go ahead and put this in a
side pony and tie it just a couple times
and the first braid we're going to do is
a bubble braid I know a lot of you seen
this before but we're going to put a
little bit of twist on this one so after
I've guy off to the side once you kind
of pull the hair kind of create some
more volume make a little bit loose and
just not so perfect so what we're going
to do is we're going to take an elastic
and go about two and two and a half
three inches down and put an elastic
here kind of looks like a little bubble
already but we're going to split that in
half like so and then we're going to
flip the ponytail in that hole and to me
it kind of creates a faux fishtail kind
of look which is that why I think it
looks like but I love this and then the
next one we're just going to start
twisting this like so you just want to
twist it it's pretty self-explanatory
and then we're going to tie it after
about three twists and this is what's
going to make a little bit different and
so then you're going to do the bubble
braid again so tie it about two inches
down like that and then you want to make
a little hole in between the hair and
then flip the ponytail through
now I'm just pulling at the braids
making everything a little bit looser
and much more full so it doesn't look
like we have just a little bit of hair
on the side of our head and then when I
got to the very end I noticed there was
too much hair going out so I just ended
up twisting it again like this tying it
and then I was pretty much done but now
I'm going to take some hair on the side
of my face down you can leave your bangs
back if you want to but I just brought
them forward a little bit and of course
I was kind of pumping up the back and
giving my hair some more volume but
that's pretty much the first look it's
super super easy and it's just a really
cute kind of braid and you're
incorporating the bow braid like a twist
it's just really cute and I like it a
lot
okay so this next one is a little bit
more fancy we're still going to go with
the nice deep side part and we are going
to be twisting down the side of our head
so you just want to twist add some hair
twist add some hair I am NOT a good
brighter especially when I have to do on
the side of my head so twisting is a
little bit easier it still didn't come
out as perfect as I wanted it to but you
know you get the point of how I wanted
to look so I'm just twisting it all the
way down and then tying it with an
elastic and then what we're going to do
after you finish that is we're going to
put everything back into a ponytail and
I kind of brushed the back a little bit
I want there to be a good bit of volume
kind of at the crown so I pushed it up
and then of course tied it and then once
I tighten the ponytail I kind of pulled
the hair a little bit more just to
create some more volume now for this one
we're going to be using a bun maker and
you're just going to put your hair
through the hole it's just like creating
a soft bun on the top of your head but
it's a little bit more difficult because
we're doing it at the lower part so you
just wanna make sure you kind of wrap
your hair around evenly if it's not
perfect don't worry you see how messy
mine is but it ends up coming together
perfectly at the end so just keep
rolling it I promise you you can
basically mold the hair to go back into
it and it looks like you took forever on
this so you can see how it looks a
little bit messed up but I'm just going
to take those hairs and kind of move
them around tuck them in and literally
your hair will stay like this all day
because this bun maker you can get it
from Claire's it's so good it like hold
your hair in place it's insane
so after you fixed your bun you're
pretty much done and I really like it
it's a great way to get your hair
completely out of your face for the day
and yet you still look like you took
forever on it but really it didn't take
long at all
now you guys know I love my buns so I am
going to put my hair up in a ponytail
and if you don't have a soft bun this is
an alternative that you can do so I just
put my hair up in a really high bun and
I tied it pretty tight and I kind of
felt like genie right here so um what
we're gonna do is take a teasing comb
you can take any teasing comb you have
and we're just going to tease this pony
because we want to have a lot of texture
with this bun because we want it to stay
in place all day since we don't have
like a soft bun or anything like that
you
so after you pretty much got everything
teased you kind of want to smooth it out
you don't want to like brush it
completely out because you still want to
have that tease but you don't want
everybody to see that you added some
texture into your hair so your hair
doesn't look crazy and we're going to
just wrap this around the ponytail and
basically it's going to kind of look
like a ballerina bun mind and turnout as
high as I wanted it to but it turns out
the same way and so as I'm going I kind
of see pieces that need to be teased a
little bit more just so that they do
stay in place all day and like I said I
am wrapping it and just kind of molding
it with my hands and getting it exactly
how I want it
so just poofing it up wrapping it around
and then I'm twisting the ends and I'm
going to tuck this underneath the bun so
you can't see it and then secure it in
place with bobby pins
now after playing with it and getting at
how I wanted I had some little baby
hairs just kind of poking up and being
stubborn so I just hairspray them down
and again this will also help the bun
stay in place all day and then that is
pretty much it I hope you guys enjoyed
