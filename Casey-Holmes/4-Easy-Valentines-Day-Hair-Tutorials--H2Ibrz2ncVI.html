okay guys let's get started so before I
blow dried my hair I put in this healthy
sexy hair soit rice wheat and leave-in
conditioner the nume argan oil and also
the Nexus Pro min-hee protected what I'm
going to do is section my hair into two
parts I'm sectioning right here where my
ears are all the way back and I'm just
gonna put this up the reason why I'm
doing this is because I will be adding
hair extensions for my hair today now
this is completely optional you don't
have to add extensions if you don't want
to these are from rebel and they're not
my favorite but they work for me right
now and I did dye them to match my hair
color so I'm just sectioning right above
where I put that one weft and it's just
a little bit of hair just so I can
attach the second weft right on top of
it
okay then you want to brush out your
hair in section and again I'm sectioning
it right above where I put that second
weft and let's go ahead and get on to
hair style number one so I'm taking my
nume 32 millimeter one this is actually
the curl jam so it has three barrels in
one I absolutely love it and I'm just
gonna put this behind my hair and wrap
it around the curling irons and as you
guys can tell I am wrapping my hair flat
around the curling iron I'm not just
twisting it so I can distribute the heat
evenly when I'm curling my hair so you
can see right here when I do this next
one I'm just rolling my hair around the
barrel but I'm rolling it blast and I
like doing that because I feel like it
distributes the heat evenly and when it
falls it just looks so so so pretty I
love it then we're done with the bottom
sections take any hairspray you want I
love this L'Oreal on that hairspray it's
really nice and never crunchy and I'm
just spraying it just to make sure my
hair stays curled all day long take down
the top section you're gonna do the same
thing as you did on the bottom and just
curl all your pieces away from your face
I never curl towards my face ever I just
don't like the way it looks
so this is what it should start looking
like just really nice big pearls I
absolutely love it for my bangs I do
something different I do straighten them
so I'll go through my bangs with a
straightener a couple times and then I
will curl the ends of my bangs because I
just like the way this looks better
I've never liked curling my bangs with
the curling iron but once you curl the
ends with your curling iron it just
blends so well with your hair and now
I'm taking a wide tooth comb and
brushing through my hair just kind of
loosening up the curl don't want them
super put together so then I'm just
going to set my curls and spray it with
that same hairspray and this is the
first look I love these curls they're my
go to my absolutely favorite which is
why I wear them like all the time
I always saw my hair like this so going
on to hairstyle number two I'm gonna
take these the Conair bobby pins and I'm
just going to leave some pieces around
my face and I'm going to gather my hair
on the side of my head and I'm gonna
bring it towards the back of my head and
then what I'm gonna do is when I pull it
all the way to the back I'm going to
gather it all and then push it up like
that to create some volume and then I'm
just going to pin this in place this is
my go-to hairstyle if I'm like not
loving the way my curls turn out that
day or something it just looks so pretty
so again I'm doing this on the other
side and leaving some bangs down because
I love it when hair frames my face
taking a Y tooth comb I'm just going to
tease some of my hair because it doesn't
look good when it's volumizing on top
and really flat on the bottom it just
looks kind of off to me and that's
pretty much it for this hairstyle so I
love the way it looks and it's just a
really nice hairstyle to go to if your
hair is bothering you that day I love it
moving on to hairstyle number three this
one's very elegant and beautiful I
personally love it what I'm gonna do is
leave some hair again beside my face to
frame it and I'm gonna start twisting my
hair away from my face and just adding
pieces as I go down and match
gonna twist until I get about halfway
down the Strand a piece of hair that I'm
twisting is probably about an inch thick
so again just going and twisting it till
about halfway down and then I'm gonna
gather my hair all on the right side of
my head now this is totally optional you
don't have to do on the right side you
could do it on the left if that's where
you like your hair to be but personally
I like mine on the right so I'm just
going to bobby pin this on this side of
my head and I really love this hairstyle
what I decided to do was pin back the
piece of hair that I had frame in my
face because I like the way it looks all
the way back but you could leave the
piece of hair beside your face if you
want to do that
if you have really pretty earrings you
want to wear it for Valentine's Day this
is a great hairstyle to have and keep in
mind if you want it a little bit more
put together you can take the pieces
that are down below whereas my neck is
on the bottom of my neck you could pin
those all the way back as well moving on
to hairstyle number four I'm just going
to take that same piece that I twisted
and bring it up to the front and I'm
gonna actually twit twist this a:hover
way down to the bottom taking it back to
the right-hand side I'm gonna gather all
my hair and wrap this around all of my
hair - the pieces that I want to keep
frame in my face so I'm just gonna wrap
this all the way around make sure it's
really nice and secure and you can kind
of see it just naturally creates a lot
of volume for your ponytail and then
what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to
bobby pin this like crazy and if you
have any extra pieces that fell then
just bobby pin those to your hair as
well and it'll look really nice and
elegant and look like you took forever
on this so this is that look I really
like this one as well again I did pull
some pieces on the other side of my head
and just made them frame my face a
little more and this is what that one
looks like so I hope you guys enjoyed
