testing out some really high-end makeup
products we have some things from Allah
priority so fancy we basically have a
tinted moisturizer that's like $200 I
also got this powder foundation because
I saw talked to use it this was a
hundred dollars it's the cellular
treatment foundation it looked amazing
on her skin and I want to try it
and then I also got this Dior
highlighter which I just showed on
snapchat this morning but I want to put
on my face on camera for you guys for
the first time so I have this and then
this isn't too expensive but it is a
liquid lipstick from huda beauty and
it's her liquid lipstick in Venus and I
just wanted to try these products on
camera for you guys mainly these two
because they're just so stupid expensive
that I want to see how well they work
and especially $200 for tinted
moisturizers like a little bit excessive
I have done a lot of drugstore videos
lately and I just wanted to play with
some high-end makeup so I have been
putting money aside to try out lots of
different high-end products I actually
have a huge order coming in let me know
if you guys want to see like a haul or
something luxury beauty products that I
just want to test out and see if I could
find dupes and things like that but let
me know if you guys would see that video
in the comments below and by liking this
video I would love to know moving on
let's first talk about this cellular
Swiss ice crystal transforming cream so
first it comes in this gorgeous
packaging this is by l'a Prairie I don't
know if I'm saying that right I hope I
am I'm not fancy but let's hope I can
get it together so it has a gorgeous
sleeve and then it comes like this I did
already take it out of the plastic
packaging because I wanted to see if the
color with semi match because I got all
of my stuff on Saks Fifth Avenue and the
colors on that website are kind of like
it's just hard to tell it's it's super
hard to tell what color you're going to
be so I wanted to see if this was going
to match and it looks a little light but
it is like attention most riser type of
things so we should be fine I'm going to
read to you what it says on the la
Prairie website by the way don't mind my
crazy hair I have to do it after I film
this video this is what this product is
in a nutshell is a triple action
treatment product cellular Swiss ice
crystal transforming cream has SPF 30
and it combines the benefit of skin care
color and sun protection and one
in turn is balanced with a natural
looking color to counteract dullness
inside the fatigue and it comes with a
complexion brush for a seamless
airbrushed finish I don't know how high
coverage is going to be this was $195
it's one fluid ounce and there is one
two three four shades that I see on the
actual website right now there's four
application for am apply daily after
serum application or skin is dry apply
over serum and moisturizer pump onto
fingertips dawn forehead cheeks and chin
use the complexion brush work in
sweeping strokes upward towards the
forehead and downward on the nose little
moisturize real quick with this G Vaughn
she Hydra sparkling shine amore
mattifying primer mattifying moisturizer
by the way my skin has recovered it's a
little bit red still my skin's recovered
from that crazy peeling a sunburn mess
in my last video I know a lot of you
were like kind of getting after me at
the texture on my skin and I'm sorry
Muskaan's not perfect and in that video
it just there's nothing that could make
my skin look smooth and flawless because
it was just going through a rough week
so this is in the shade of xxx beige and
then you just open it up like this and
you have this little card right here
then you have the product oh hello then
you have the little brush and the
product which just looks stunning
doesn't it actually purchase some
skincare items from them that I'm trying
out the packaging is just gorgeous on
these products which it should be
because it's freaking expensive by the
way this is oil free again SPF 30 and
yeah we're just going to kind of wing
kiss what I'm shooting for in this video
is doing half of my face with this and
then half of my face with the powder
foundation and if this doesn't cover a
lot to see if I could put the powder
foundation on top of it to add extra
coverage if it handles product on top of
it well so that's kind of what we're
doing in this video first it says to
pump onto fingertips dot on forehead
cheeks and chin that's what it looks
like so I'm just going to dot on my
forehead cheeks it kind of feels like
water so pretty runny consistency and
then it says to use the complexion brush
work in sweeping strokes upward on the
forehead and downward on the nose
starting from the center
where you sweeping circular strokes
along the cheeks and chin so I guess
just like that Wow smells really good
smells like skin care blend downward
along jawline if more coverage desired
apply with fingertips apply it another
application
oh so it's buildable okay okay okay so
there is one layer you can see the
difference in this side on this side
definitely just kind of even it out a
little bit you could still see some
redness but not as intense as this side
so we're going to apply another layer
since you can build it up and how much
you have to build up for super intense
coverage because is it expensive
products you know what I'm saying you
trying to go through it in month it
feels really good on the skin as well it
feels very lightweight and moisturizing
now I'm getting like brushstrokes adding
more products so I'm gonna actually take
a Beauty Blender and just Pat it in oh
that second layer was getting brush
strokes all over but I feel like it
looks good like this looks like
something since it's good for your skin
it's something you could just put on and
go out the door like running errands or
whatever I would totally rock this look
with like just mascara no not this full
glam but just mascara and a little bit
concealer I think that looks really nice
I like sinking into my pores I want to
try one more layer with a Beauty Blender
just to see how it works I know it's a
really runny consistency so hopefully
the Beauty Blender doesn't soak up a lot
of product this is just for testing out
purposes I would just leave it like this
if I was going throughout my day and
like said it with translucent powder
I thought when I first got this it was
like a fluid foundation like something
that's going to be high coverage but
it's just like a tinted moisturizer but
it does have really great coverage even
though I had to apply three layers I
would have stopped at two or just leave
that as is and then we're going to move
on to this powder foundation again I got
this because it's all talked to using it
you put it on her face with a sponge it
looked like it had just great coverage
and I was so interested in trying it
apply wet or dry depending on the look
you want to achieve is totally
customizable to whatever level of
coverage you desire cellular treatment
powder foundation can be used as a
primary foundation for a or for a light
touch up throughout the day it's
advanced formula rich in plant extracts
antioxidants and oil absorbing complex
minimizes the appearance of lines Hey
very refined totally beautiful pretty
self-explanatory and like I said I kind
of want to see like if I could put it on
top of this maybe with a powder brush or
something but then again I want to set
this side with a translucent powder to
kind of see just how it wears throughout
the day do you open this up and it comes
in this pretty case and then you have
this mirror right here which is gorgeous
but my fingerprints are getting all over
it and then there's the powder and the
sponge and this is a huge compact and
the mirror is gorgeous look at how that
mirror looks I'm not going to use a
primer I'm just going to go straight in
after my moisturizer so I'm going to
take some on the sponge whoa oh shut the
front door
you know what I forgot concealer
 definitely I'm matte finish so if
you don't like Matt or have super dry
skin you might not like this it's color
matches kind of perfectly this is in the
shade natural beige
that is insane look at that I mean I
know it worked
so Ellen talked to you and I was like
wow that looks amazing but I didn't
think it would cover rosacea as well as
it just did now so there it is on the
skin this is no primer nothing like that
I now don't have any concealer on
because I didn't think about it okay so
really quickly let me set this side with
a translucent setting powder I'm just
gonna use the Laura Mercier one I have
it right here on my desk there we go now
we're looking kind of even I think I
need to go over my nose at the powder
foundation because it's a little bit
splotchy so we have this ice crystal
moisturizing corrector on this side with
a translucent powder this side is the
powder foundation wow I'm like blown
away by these products honestly I don't
even know what to say I can't wait to
wear them throughout the day it's right
now it is 208 and I'm just going to go
ahead and apply bronzer and just you
know contour my face a little bit and
I'll be back to give you an update on
how everything applied to each side and
yeah I will be right back
okay so I've applied a bronzer
contouring things like that and now I
want to go ahead and put on this Dior
nude air Luminizer and this is a new
highlighter I saw on Saks haven't seen
anyone talk about it and I am so excited
to try it out because I forget what the
highlighter was that they were had a
long time ago that everybody was trying
to get it was hard to your hands on it
cuz they were just continuing it and all
that kind of stuff
I have only seen this on Saks ah but I
don't I don't know if you can get it
anywhere else I will leave a link for it
down below if you're interested it is
pricey because it is do your but wait
wait till you see it so it comes with a
little brush like this just a little
kabuki brush which is actually really
nice I would personally use this for
something other than highlighter but I
would totally keep that and then it also
comes with this because like the little
case for it just looks like that very
sleek and pretty and then you just pop
your compact in there like so but I
don't have to keep those so let's be
real and then this is what it looks like
it looks like the bronzer packaging
which I love the bronzer from them
illegal and I'm talking about down below
it is just so stunning and then are you
ready
oh my gosh it's so pretty
let me do a swatch for you oh my god
it's like a peachy white gold type of
color I'm obsessed with it oh my god I
can't wait to put this on my face so I'm
just going to use the honest Asya
highlighting brush this is the a23
everything that I talk about in this
video will be linked down below oh that
is so pretty this is a really intense
highlighter oh my gosh I would say go
with a light hand with it but you know
when you get that first new highlighter
you just gotta test it out so now I look
glowy and dewy and now I'm going to move
on and use this huda beauty liquid matte
lipstick and Venus cutest packaging ever
I love this she has really cute
packaging her eyelash packaging is very
cute as well this is what looks like
it's just a frosted glass the frosted
top I will say this kind of gives me
like I don't know makes my teeth hurt I
know that's kind of weird but it kind of
makes my teeth hurt with how this feels
that's okay I can get past it so again
this is in the shade Venus that's the
applicator right there I'm just gonna
apply this without a lip liner oh it's a
lot lighter than I expected
this smells like like the pool like when
I go lay out by the pool or something
very nice formula easy to apply with the
Dhokla applicator not too much product
comes out again this is in the shade
Venus it's more of my skin color I'm
probably going to top it with a darker
gloss but it is really nice and it
smells really good too if I had to pick
one product to get it would be the
powder foundation by far I do like this
side I think this side is good for
everyday but I just feel like this side
looks so much more flawless doesn't
accentuate my pores as much as this one
does then again I do bring my
highlighter a little too far in so big
pore problems I mean I think they both
look great but they both are definitely
different so again this is the tinted
moisturizer this is the powder
foundation when I put on makeup I
definitely like a full coverage finish
and I like something flawless and that's
gonna look really nice
so it's 226 and yeah we're just gonna
wear it throughout the day so now I just
need to my hair film another video go
run some errands I will see you guys in
just a few hours hi guys so it is
currently 11:45 and as you can see I am
pretty shiny that's because I have not
touched up my face at all since earlier
I went grocery shopping came back I did
some things around the house I edited I
made some dinner watch Gilmore Girls and
I just did my things i touched up this
side of my face more than I did this
side this is a powder foundation side
and this is the tinted moisturizer side
I have like mixed feelings I and my
mixed feelings I mean like I don't know
which one I like more once I got off
camera I loved the way this looked in
natural lighting I just thought it was
gorgeous but I also love the way this
looks and this says Matt a lot longer
like if you have oily skin you're
definitely had to powder this stuff
throughout the day to keep you Matt I've
never tried a powder foundation actually
loved it like I do this one like I love
it I stayed matte for a really long time
I didn't really touch the side of it all
I don't think I did touch my side this
side up at all I think is only on this
side so this is going pretty dang strong
for not being touched up and this side
is going just as well this side just
looks so nice just looks like skin I
feel like I should tell you guys to
choose one or the other I feel like
if you have oily skin and you want one
product to have I would go with this
powder foundation I think it's awesome
quickly just touch up my face now so I'm
just going to dust some more of this on
my face normally you would take a
blotting machine but how many times have
I said I don't have any because I'm too
lazy to go to Ulta just like that your
mattified it looks like skin it doesn't
look like you're wearing a ton of
product on your face I got away with not
wearing concealer today which is insane
I don't know how that happened but I
didn't wear concealer I don't feel like
it looked absolutely terrible at all I
can't wait to wear this on top of
concealer and see when I first read
literally before I started this video
earlier today that this is like a tinted
moisturizer type of thing I was like oh
man I just spent $200 on a gentle
moisturizer like really because I'm
usually not about that life usually I
just don't I won't wear it to do
moisturizer because I love a full
coverage foundation but this gives such
amazing coverage I mean it covered up my
redness so well as you guys saw and it
looked like skin but it will save you
have oily skin and you want me to tell
you one thing that you should get from
this video I would say say the extra
hundred dollars on this product and just
get the powder foundation because this
powder foundation is so freakin good and
I swear to I would not tell you that
this is amazing if I didn't think was
awesome you guys saw in the video that
it just glided over my rosacea I didn't
even use a primer and it just looks so
good I'm definitely gonna keep this but
I feel like this will be used a lot more
when it's more fall winter time and I'm
not so early throughout the day because
I'm sweating and my oils are just like
coming out of my face but I'm gonna keep
both in because I want to still play
with them I want to put this down and
put this on top and just see how it
works even though it's a freaking
expensive combo also moving on I want to
quickly discuss the other two items that
I showed you guys which was the
highlighter and the liquid lip I love
this highlighter it's so pretty as you
could tell when I first got on camera
I'm oily as hell so I got that natural
glow going but this is so pretty lasted
all day absolutely love this hands-down
worth the money or this liquid lipstick
I have to say I love the formula I love
the way it wore throughout the day I
thought it was amazing
I didn't feel it on my lips it wasn't an
inconvenient thing to wear it was not
overly drying anything like that I will
say this Smashbox liquid lipsticks are
still my favorite formula wise and I
will probably be exchanging this color
for a different color because this was
my lip color like literally my lip color
um and I thought it was going to be more
of a darker nude so I'm going to
exchange it for a different color if you
have an iron knees and you want to try
them out I say give it a go I think
they're awesome it's just is such a
comfortable formula but the Smashbox
liquid lipsticks are still my all-time
favorite formulas everything lasted on
my skin pretty much the liquid lip is
still on you just can't tell because
it's literally the same color in my lips
everything lasted all day nothing wore
off yes I got a little bit oily because
it was hot but I had not touched up
since like 5 o'clock and it's 11:00 now
so of course some of my oils are gonna
come through but you could easily fix
that with a tissue or blotting sheets
I'm excited to rip off these lashes and
do my little overnight mask thank you
guys again so much for watching if you
did like this video don't forget to give
it a thumbs up also let me know what you
think about these new lights right now I
just have these two new lights on and
not my warm lights back here I'm going
to figure out how to make these lights
cool toned because I know they can be
cool toned I just f'd them up and now
they're really warm so I figure that out
but I have lights that shine back here
and I have lights that shine on me um
but I wanted something not so warm right
here in front of me
so I went with more cool toned lights
and I really like it so far I think the
color is definitely true but let me know
what you guys think do you like them do
you not like them I got to fix the
background I know I got to fix the
background lighting because it's just
too warm thank you guys again so much
for watching and I will see you all in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
