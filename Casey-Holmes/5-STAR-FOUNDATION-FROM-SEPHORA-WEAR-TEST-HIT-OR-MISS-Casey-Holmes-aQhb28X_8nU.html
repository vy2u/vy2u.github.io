going to be trying out this new jiangshi
foundation that has almost 5 stars on
the flora granted there are 20 reviews
which versa for is not that many but for
20 reviews - all se 5 stars I think
that's pretty awesome theory I would
test this out because it is a velvet
radiant mattifying foundation so I'm
really excited to test it out as you
could tell is a 4th of July I'm going to
be putting this to the test wearing it
out and about seeing how long it lasts
and seeing if it can last on some oily
skin and keep me matte throughout the
day if you're excited for this videos
and definitely keep watching and don't
forget to subscribe before you leave and
let's go ahead and get started so this
is the box that the foundation comes in
I think it's a pretty standard box I
feel like all of Jiwon cheese foundation
boxes look the same but this is a really
really nice glass bottle it has some
weight to it the plastic even feels
really nice so it just looks really
pretty it just feel luxurious which it
should because this foundation is $54
which is pretty pricey as most of you
know I love my junk store foundations so
this might be really good it does have
SPF 20 and one fluid ounce which is
standard so I'm going to try this two
different ways we're going to use a
plunger from L'Oreal and also a brush
we're gonna see which side I like it
better and let's see a little bit more
it says it's a medium sheer coverage
which not like a full coverage finish
but so we're going to try to outfit it's
a satin matte radiant natural foundation
so I'm just going to quickly put on my
regular primers we have the primer water
a Smashbox and became an Austin
mattifying primer shade I'm gonna be
using today is 0-6 matte gold I'm
guessing that says up on the bottom and
it does have a nice pump to it put it on
the live stream as you can see so the
first side I'm going to do is the sponge
so I'm using my favorite l'oreal signed
and we're going to do this side with a
sponge
they smelled like apples
unlike the smell of apples it's not too
strong but you could definitely smell it
when you put it on your skin yeah this
is definitely a medium coverage
foundation like I told you guys I'm more
of a full coverage finish kind of person
but I just don't want to try this out
since it has such good reviews and since
I do bring my concealer down like this
it does add just a little bit more
coverage so we'll see how that looks
so that's one layer I do think it looks
really pretty I feel like it's oxidizing
just a little bit it's going a little
bit more orange on me but it does look
nice on the skin it doesn't look like
you're wearing foundation but as you can
see all of this is still pretty exposed
and you know what's okay on camera but
in person definitely there and this is
oxidizing more and more as time goes on
alright so let's try brush now these
maybe we get a little bit more coverage
I feel like you get the same amount of
coverage with each tool like it's both
medium I am not liking how this is
oxidized and you see how it's like
oxidizing in the neck it does look
really pretty on the skin so that's what
the foundation it looks like with just
one layer on each side okay so I do
think you get a little bit more coverage
with the brush but it is a like natural
matte finish with use I can add a little
bit more coverage to this cheek over
here since the brush seems to give a
little bit more coverage so I think a
brush is like the way to go with this
product take this back to the hairline
kind of like that like the coverage if
you just want to build it up a little
bit more on your problem areas but if
you have severe redness you'll probably
want to stick away from this just
because it's not going to give you that
full coverage finish unless that's
something that you don't want it does
feel really lightweight on the skin
smack situating pores looks really
really pretty like it and it's not like
powdery or anything it really does just
look at the second layer of skin now
when
take my concealer down like this it's
going to add a little bit more coverage
and it's also going to lighten up the
foundation a little bit which is what we
need in a weird way this kind of feels
like I got tightening effect like you
know when you put on modifying primers
and it kind of like tightens just a
little bit it feels like it's tightening
just a tad which is not bad but a little
different maybe because it's just drying
down really quickly it's like completely
dry now it's definitely drive down so
like a velvet finish which is what the
foundation is supposed to do and I'm
just going to go ahead and apply some
concealers lighten this up hopefully
look a little less orange okay so this
is what the foundation and concealer
combo looks like you could tell them
definitely you can see a little bit more
of the orange color which is why I kind
of dragged my concealer down to blend to
make sure we don't have any liens but so
far it's looking okay um I'm obsessed
with the foundation just yet but the
concealer wasn't hard to blend out and
it still just looks like skin it doesn't
look super heavy or anything okay so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
ahead finish dress my makeups a nice a
tom bronzer foundation bronzer
foundation I'm going to put on a bronzer
just a little bit probably just contour
my face apply those products and some
highlight lip product and I'll be back
to give you guys another update before
we wear this throughout the day so this
is what the foundation looks like with
all the other products added on let me
know what you guys think
I actually think it looks pretty good I
don't think it looks bad it is pre it's
like it's definitely on the matte side
everything went on really well blended
really well and so far I like it and
it's really not accentuating my pores or
anything like that I do feel like it
kind of makes my chin like a little like
older right here as you can see but so
far I do like it I don't have anything
bad to say as a mouth so hopefully it
does last quite a while so right now it
is currently 3:30 and I'm about to go
ahead out and do some things and I will
update you guys a little bit later so
I'll see you guys in just a little bit
hey guys so we're back I'm going to
share with you what time it is real
quick before my phone dies
and that took 1% so it's 12 and 19 right
now remember what time I left you guys
but I just got back from watching
fireworks and everything for the 4th of
July my lipsticks like worn off my
hair's a mess but I figured I would go
ahead and give you guys a little update
on this foundation I have not blotted or
anything that's throughout the night
obviously I'm not like really looked at
my face because all the bars I've been
in have been so dark so you know in the
bars are can you look real cute because
it's dark you just can't really saw your
foundation once that's what's been
evident I just haven't felt like it
manage of lot because I didn't look
super super shiny which right now I do
look pretty shiny but not as bad as some
foundations look on me definitely around
the nose is a little questionable like
it looks a little rough let's just do be
you guys in this is what the foundation
looks like after these few hours of wear
I think it looks pretty good I mean it
hasn't broken up on my nose just great
has broken up just a little bit on my
chin area right here you guys hopefully
see that hasn't broken up on my for
Henry Ford still it's ok I think it's
harder to block the excess oil away and
just like the product that's sitting on
my skin it will look a lot better
especially in the nose area like I need
that to be blotted ASAP but for the most
part it really doesn't look that bad I
mean I'm going to be honest beer of
course and don't have blotting sheets
right here so like I say that every
single time but whose really don't and I
also cleaned out my purse the other day
and I did have blotting sheets in there
but obviously needs a light purchase and
more from Claudio unlike Amazon or
something because they're not an old sow
anymore I mean my contour my highlight
my blush is still I mean my contour is
going strong girls did use this Tarte
clay play palette and I've been really
liking it and look at that
of course I've really because I'm oily
girl but it really doesn't look as bad
as I thought it was would look well I
say it's like my ultimate favorite
probably not but it really is not that
bad I mean it lasted amazing throughout
the day I will say it's not that hot up
here so if it is very humid and hot
where you are might be a different story
I of course moved from Georgia to New
York so the weather is like a 180
honestly what I'm going to quickly do is
take this Kat Von D blotting powder
shade medium with a duo fiber brush I'm
going to lightly go over these areas
this because I want to see what it looks
like if you add a little bit of powder
on top is pretty lightweight it's a
pretty lightweight foundation like I
didn't feel like I was wearing heavy
makeup when I was out I always recommend
blotting before you apply powder I have
to say I don't think this is like my
favorite powder I don't know I'm not
stressed a bit I used it in a video
yesterday wasn't obsessed with it and I
use it now and I'm not really like
feeling it I do think the foundation
looks okay again we're having some
issues here in the nose area that I
really feel like just need to get a good
blot in and get that excess product off
I think it's so hard to really love
drugstore foundations and then try to
find a high-end one that you're obsessed
with that's like worth the price I've in
etosha de Nona Foundation excellent I
love that I think it's amazing but this
one I am on the fence about I'm more of
a like full coverage or Nothing type of
person but this did build up really
nicely and it feels really good on the
skin so personally I give it a thumbs up
would I repurchase it if I ran out of it
probably not just because I'm not overly
impressed by it especially for the price
is still love like the web while photos
focus and Maybelline Dream matte mousse
a little bit better but this is a really
nice foundation I don't think it's bad
at all anything else it on the skin I
think it's going to be all about if you
want to try out or not I would
definitely go get a sample if your
sephora house is you washing in it if it
doesn't and you want to spend the money
and try it out I think you go because
it's really not a bad purchase thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video let me know what you
think down below in the comments do you
think it's a five star foundation I
think it is a really great foundation I
could see why people give it five stars
but I would give it probably like a four
I'm getting like a four or five star it
wouldn't be breaking up right here on my
chin and get a little kick in here but
for the most part it looks really great
foundation so I hope you guys enjoyed it
thank you again so much for watching
don't forget to subscribe before you
leave and I will see you guys in my next
video bye
