sharing with you some different sponges
that have come out recently that are
really interesting and I wanted to try
them out on camera with you guys to see
how they work see if they're worth the
money all that kind of stuff so we have
three formal techniques and one from BH
Cosmetics hope you don't mind I haven't
done my hair and I'm in just a regular
t-shirt because I just didn't feel like
going straight into hair yet when my
hair is not done I don't feel like glam
so I don't want to wear glam so I'm just
wearing this adidas shirt and relaxing
so if you have not subscribed to my
channel make sure you do subscribe I
will leave a link right here or there
will be a link in the description box if
you want to subscribe and don't forget
to give this video a thumbs up if you
liked it and yeah let's just go ahead
and try these new weird sponges out
first one we're going to look at is this
BH Cosmetics precision sponge and it
says that it's a streak free application
of liquid and cream complexion products
and that's pretty much it I just thought
this one was interesting just cuz the
shape of it like look at that doesn't
that look so weird
suppose was supposed to get right
underneath your eye really well and
right here in the inner corner which I
could totally see I don't know how well
this is going to expand it feels a
little stiff now but I thought the same
thing about the elf sponge but that
actually feels really good so hopefully
this will expand and feel good on the
skin next one is this Real Techniques
miracle sculpting sponge and I don't
normally a cream contour anything today
I'm going to do it today with this
sponge and just see how well it works
and see if I like it a little bit better
and basically this side is for contour
the sides for highlight and you could
see the shape right there it's a little
bit different flat right here and then
flat on this end so again the sides for
contour on this side right here is for
highlight next sponge we are going to
try hopefully in this video I think I
might put a mascara on or something to
see if I can get it to flake so I can
use these but either way we're going to
try to test these out or maybe if you
tried this to bake with you know just
different things they remind me of the
mini Beauty Blender I think the mini
Beauty blenders are like 10 dollars and
these were six and you get two so this
is what the packaging looks like by the
way for this one and then the sculpting
sponge and I purchased these online as
well from Ulta
so here's a list like up close you have
this pointed end and then you also have
this flat side as well this one finally
came in I've been waiting for this one
this is like the one that started this
whole video it's the Real Techniques
bold metals collection miracle diamond
sponge and I saw this online and you
guys have been sending me so many
pictures on this product of course I had
to try it out for you guys so we're
gonna see how it works
the orange Real Techniques sponge is
really really great if you've not tried
it you should too great alternative oh
this will good so far
that's what it looks like mine's not as
like colorful is some that I've seen
online I kind of wish it was more gray
in it but you know I'm just being picky
so I'm really quickly going to go and
dampen all of these sponges put them
under water get them wet and then we'll
be back to try everything out okay so I
just got all the sponges wet and it will
say the Real Techniques ones feel really
good they're like really squishy and
just bouncy so so far so good on these
they feel awesome
he BH Cosmetics one did get a little bit
bigger but this end right here is pretty
dense like it's not very bouncy this
part is this part feels really good but
there's like basically no sponge up here
this part feels just super hard to
squeeze what we're going to do is we're
going to do one side of our face with
the Real Techniques one so basically the
top right here is to buff and blend for
a flawless finish the smaller flat sides
right here they are to work around eyes
mouth and brow bone the larger sides
like this are to function as a wedge to
apply makeup to larger area and really
get that and then the pointed tip is to
cover small imperfections so we're just
going to use this to blend our
foundation and see how well it works I'm
going to be taking these Smashbox
Studios Skin Foundation I'm just going
to apply it I feel like what feels best
and just let you know if it applies it
really well
I feel like it covers a large area and
I'm getting pretty good coverage it gets
right underneath the eye even without
going to the pointed side so I like that
look at that that's actually really good
coverage then I'm going to take the flat
side right here and I'm just going to go
in and put it on my forehead see what
side I like best I think this side gets
up in the hairline really nicely like if
you have blond hair and you have a hard
time with foundations getting in your
hair you could use this pointed side to
really get in there it says to use these
edges around your mouth take a little
bit of product I'm going to be honest I
don't know it's like a huge difference
with the edge I'm pretty much on to this
side like I love the flat side thing
looks great and I think it applies so
incredibly quickly since it is such a
large sponge just kind of it's a large
area of my face that's what this one I
really like it so far I'm going to go in
with the BH Cosmetics line which is kind
of stiff I'm a little nervous
put it on the back it's a little awkward
to hold this just because you really
don't have much to hold on to it sounds
like a ball do you hear that I hope you
guys can hear that but I can't really
get underneath my eyes with the rounded
part so I'm going to try the tip what so
weird
it definitely gets right underneath the
eye but it's so flimsy it doesn't blend
it out we're going to try it with
concealer to just to really see like I'm
already over the sponge I want to go
back to the Diamond sponge I like it a
little bit better get more coverage with
the Real Techniques one than this one
just because I feel like the Real
Techniques diamond sponge really presses
it into the skin whereas this one is
just kind of like whatever and I'm going
to be using a pretty full coverage
concealer I'm going to use the Tarte
shape tape one and I'm using the shade
light/medium what I'm going to do for
this one since we have multiple sponges
to work with and this one's supposed to
be for contour and highlight I'm going
to use this to blend out concealer at
some points but I first want to try this
one I kind of don't feel like this one's
going to blend out this concealer really
well so that's why I'm probably gonna go
with this one on this side we're going
to try out this for under eyes okay so
again it says the small flat side is for
your eyes I feel like I have to squeeze
it oh it gets right underneath there
okay you don't really have to squeeze it
to get underneath that eye since it has
a flat edge it really does get right
underneath that lower lash line I'm
super impressed and I'm just going to
take the pointed side and try to blend
right in here it's one thing with a
Beauty Blender like the original one I
love it but it's kind of hard sometimes
to get right in that inner corner then
ended up working out really well taking
this one oh okay it does spread the
product doesn't it take forever to blend
out
I don't know if I like the tip of this I
like it to clean up the edge that's
really nice but I don't feel like it's
actually blending it into the skin I
feel like I need like a little bit more
sponge to really work it in there I'm
gonna try this one this is the highlight
side so we're just gonna see it's blends
out I like it but it's smaller so it's
kind of annoying to keep pouncing so
much I would much rather just go in with
this one with the flat side for eyes and
just push it in there because this also
blends out on the cheek at the same
exact time which I enjoy so far this
one's the winner this one's really
taking the cake right now and now we're
going to highlight the rest of our face
with concealer and then we're going to
use this to blend it and again I just
don't like the size of it if you like
smaller sponges you probably like this
but I find myself wanting to switch to
this side which is the contour side to
really blend it out actually let's just
go ahead and do it I personally don't
like to spend too much time blending
things out if I don't have to so if a
sponge can hit a larger area of my face
that's awesome make the application
process quicker okay now we're going to
cream contour and we're supposed to use
this side with it so I'm going to be
using this new NARS product that I got
in the mail this is the hot stand Laguna
duo
I hope this blends over a little too
okay now we're going to take our sponge
and just blend it out
I feel like I'm going to the edge of the
sponge more than I am just this flat
side I'm trying the flat side now mmm
don't think I like it
so it is blending it out this NARS
product is actually a bitch to pick up
to blend out because it feels like it
dries pretty quickly but it's blending
it out so that's good now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to bake my under eyes
I'm going to use this little tiny sponge
gonna take the flower beauty product and
I'm gonna actually use the flat side of
this to get in there we're just going to
think I kind of like how little it is it
gets right under that lower lash line
into those crease lines now I'm going to
take this side and I'm just going to the
same exact thing this is kind of like a
Beauty Blender right here oh yeah
think it's kind of obvious which sponge
I think is worth it so I'm going to go
ahead finish off the rest my face makeup
finish my hair and then I will be back
to give you guys a final update on these
products okay guys so I am officially
done with my makeup and added some
volume to my hair
I don't like clean hair do you guys like
clean hair I'm going to really quickly
wrap this video up and I just want to
say I've tried out all these sponges I
don't hate them but I feel like if
you're going to purchase one sponge it
should be the Real Techniques diamond
sponge I really like this flat and I
love that you can get right underneath
your eye with this one as well at first
I thought was going to be kind of
awkward but it actually fits right
underneath that lower lash line
perfectly and I really feel like this is
the most practical one of all of them
I'm going to use this definitely the
most and the texture is really nice it's
really bouncy and I feel like it gives
me a nice full coverage finish for my
foundations and I like that this is so
pointy that I could get into the inner
corners of my eye now this little guy I
do like - I have to say it's not
necessarily practical for me because
it's so little
I went in underneath my eyes to clean up
from my scare and my eyeliner and it
cleaned up so well like if you put this
in your bag a it could get really messy
but it could clean up mascara flakes and
your eyeliner like if you get eyeliner
smudged out here you could just take
sponge get right underneath
and it would clean it up so it's good
for that but if I would use it every
single day I went and say I would I
would probably just use this one and I
guarantee that it's a dupe before the
Beautyblender mini sponges this one I
didn't really like um I just I don't
like this for concealer or highlighter I
just think it's too small it's just too
much work and the same goes for this one
I would probably use this one for my
under eye concealer actually actually
that might be really nice so I would
probably pass on that one and this one I
totally see where they were going with
this it's not a terrible sponge but I
it's just not like bouncy enough for me
it doesn't really feel that great when
I'm putting foundation on my skin it
does apply the foundation well and I
like this for like putting this right
underneath the lower lash line but when
you actually have to blend it out
there's just not enough sponge here to
really press it into the skin and help
blend it out but like I said I totally
see where they're going with it I mean
you could totally clean up the edge of
an eyeshadow but to actually get
everything blended out really quickly
and this just this just doesn't work but
I see what they were gonna do with you I
see what they were doing anyways I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know

sponge would you go for would you go for
the smaller sponge do not would you like
