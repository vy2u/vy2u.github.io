telling you guys all about my hair care
routine this is literally one of the
most requested videos on my channel I
did a blog post not too long ago showing
you guys some products I use on my hair
care but um yeah but you guys still
wanna see video and I'm giving what you
want and do a video for you guys so I'm
going to go through each step of my
haircare it might be a long video but
it's all the information you want to
know
so the first thing I want to mention is
my color I did have a video showing you
guys how I dyed my hair a few months ago
I actually made that video private
because I now have a new way of dyeing
my hair and I like it a lot better so
the next time I do dye my hair I will
film it for you so this is a color I
have dyed my hair the past couple times
I've died at this time in the last time
it was this color it's the l'oreal
preference permanent hair color and lush
cherry the base is violence so a lot of
you when i put this in the description
box of the videos you guys are asking it
they're two separate colors the violet
and the red no it's just one whole color
it just has a base of violet so i love
this shade you can get this from Sally's
I use two bottles of hair color and then
for my developer I use number 20 that
just works for my hair I've been using
20 for like a while ever since I first
dye my hair and it hasn't done anything
too bad to my hair and the color is very
vibrant so that's just what I use yeah I
love this stuff you can get at Sally's
for I think like 6 bucks a bottle it's
super cheap and I never go get my hair
dyed anymore the only thing I do is I do
go get a trim and I just go to like a
local salon and say can you just trim my
hair and that's all I want I just want a
trim I do get trims every few months
because whenever I notice my hair is
getting a little bit dull and kind of
gross that's when I'll go get a trim I
think you should get kind of regular
trims because it works wonders I mean I
feel like I got a trim last time and my
hair grew like two inches it was so
insane my hair does grow really fast as
long as I take good care of it by the
way the cut of my hair I just have a
basic cut long layers and then I get
them to like the sides over here I guess
you can call this bangs they're really
long but she'll just like I don't know
what you call it she'll take her
scissors and go like this to the sides I
only wash my hair twice a week and I
wash it on Mondays and on Fridays so
before the weekend and right when the
week starts and the first day these are
the products I use so the shampoo is
this lush big sea salt shampoo I love
this stuff it is really really great
I was kind of iffy bad because it's a
little bit it's a chunky so chunky
shampoo it's actually really easy to
work with it lathers up very well I just
take a scoop rather to my hands and I
work it all throughout my hair now I do
shampoo my hair twice in the shower
because I actually watched Nicole
Guerrero's video when she talked about
her hair care routine and she mentioned
you know that she washes hers twice
because if you felt like it wasn't clean
before wash it again and you'll see a
complete difference and that's when you
know it's really clean when it starts
lathering up so after I saw her mention
that I've been washing my hair twice in
the shower and it has really made a huge
difference with my hair and it's also
made a difference with how long I can go
without washing my hair because when I
do that I really get all the gunk and
nastiness out and all the dry shampoo
that's built up in my hair and it
completely starts fresh I love this it
does give a lot of volume it actually is
really nice because it makes my hair
super shiny as well is it supposed to do
that oh yeah I supposed to have fresh
citrus juices for an incredible shine
this is really good lush is pretty
expensive but honestly I've had this for
a while I do use it once a week I think
it's great stuff I love lush and this is
a great shampoo I highly recommend this
and then that shampoo will kind of dry
out your hair and you'll definitely feel
how dry it is
so I recommend going in with a deep
conditioning mask this is my favorite by
far it's macadamia and deeper pear mask
I will be purchasing my fourth one very
soon but it smells so good you guys I
recommend using a mask at least once a
week because you do need something
that's really deep conditioning for your
hair your hair goes through a lot
especially if you wash it every day you
need a deep conditioning mask in your
life so I love this highly recommended
these two together are just amazing and
then for Friday's would I use it kind of
just switches out every now and then but
I've been really loving this combo I use
the bio launch altra hydrating shampoo
it says nourishes thick coarse hair I
don't have thick coarse hair I have a
lot of hair but it's not thick or coarse
it's kind of it breaks really easily so
I would say it's fine but I do have a
lot of hair
I love the way
lunch smells it's like probably the best
smelling shampoo I've ever smelled in my
life they always have amazing smells
again I do wash twice in the shower and
then I follow up with another
conditioner I really like Herbal Essence
I like this line the Hydra licious and
it also like the tussle me softly line
they make my hair super super soft but I
go in with this conditioner after I use
this because I find that this dries my
hair out a little bit in the shower so I
always go in with this guy and it
completely makes my hair feel so soft
and silky and it looks so shiny so I
like rebel essence they got good stuff
and really quickly before I get on to
styling cries I do want to mention that
I used to be that kind of person that
said I could never go a day without
washing my hair back and I was blonde
and like I first started my channel you
could check out other videos or the
older videos I have for my hair care
routine I was always like you know I
can't go a day without washing my hair
I'm here so oily you don't understand
yeah but honestly you have to work to
get your hair to not have to wash it
every day especially if you are washing
every day it's not good for your hair
you're stripping your hair the natural
oils now what I did was when I finally
was like oh my god my hair is becoming
like fried and broken off everywhere
what I did was I started going every
other day and then I did that for a
while and then I went to every two days
and I did that for a while and now I can
go 3 or 4 days without washing my hair
and that's because I've worked my way
towards it and your hair will thank you
it's really hard at first trust me I
know it is so hard to go 1 or 2 days
without washing your hair when you're
just starting you know when you're just
trying to get your hair can used to that
in the beginning but you will get to the
point where you're so happy you did it
because it literally changes your hairs
life like it will be so much healthier
like back when I was blonde and I wanted
to go 3-4 days it would never look like
this this is my third or fourth day hair
I have a very oily scalp you guys and I
mean look at that I have to thank most
of it though to my dry shampoo because
like this morning my hair was so oily
like it was kind of like so flat to my
head but once I used this dry
shampoo which is the batiste dry shampoo
it gave it more life it made it look
refreshed and you would never guess this
is third third or fourth day here at
least third day you would never guess
this is third day hair sometimes if my
hair is super gray see on the fourth day
I'll throw up in a soft bun and yet you
still look like you tried but you got
greasy hair nobody is gonna know now
moving on to when I get out of the
shower I always want to call my hair
please do not paddle brush your hair
please do not use a paddle brush because
every time I see a girl do it it makes
me like kind of like tense up and just
be like stop don't do it because that
will break your hair quick because your
hair is wet it's fragile once you get on
shower that's like the most fragile
state your hair is in you don't want to
use a powder brush on your hair it's
just going to break that hair off the
best way to comb out your hair is to why
tooth comb your hair show you a side
panel of the why tooth comb that I use
actually got it from my stepmom a long
time ago and I only started putting it
to use about last year because when I
first got it she was like you need to
watch you comb your hair because you're
gonna break your hair off and you're
gonna have really damaged hair and I
would try it I'm like this sucks this is
taken forever I don't want to do it and
then finally last year I was like I
can't stand how damaged my hair looks
right now I'm going to start using the
white tooth comb and that alone made a
huge difference as well what I like to
do is I'll take my hair when I write
down the shower I like to wait about 10
or 15 minutes before I touch it I'll let
it kind of air dry you know have some of
the water sink into the towel whatever
so then I let it down and then I start
with my ends and I'll take the white
tooth comb and I'll start brushing out
the ends and then I'll work my way to
the top now doing that is a lot better
than just starting from the top and like
trying to pull it down cause you're
going to break your hair a lot more that
way this way you're already kind of
getting the tangles from the bottom and
you're just working your way to the top
and it's pretty easy once you get the
hang of it
I do think it takes a little bit of time
but it's worth the time that you take -
why should comb that hair I really
recommend doing that
you know they got Whitey's Cubs
everywhere the guy I met salons I got em
at drugstores you can get the plastic
ones they work really well as well you
can get a Miss Sally's so after I want
to call my hair it has been time to use
my styling products and this kind of
changes there's only one product that
doesn't change but the one that I really
recommend I'm actually out of it I'm
waiting for an Ulta to open up the place
I go shopping soon so I can stock up on
this I love this this is the kenra
platinum blow-dry spray first off it
smells amazing and I'm like I said I'm
out of it but it is a blow-dry spray so
you spray it on your hair before you
blow-dry and it's a thermal protectant
as well and this will also make your
hair dry a lot quicker if you put this
in your hair make sure hair really shiny
super healthy and again it does protect
from that blow-dryer so I love this
stuff it is kind of pricey but if you're
willing to spend the money on it you
should definitely give this a try now
lately what I've been using is this 12
benefits actually used up another one
this is a newer bottle that I've been on
and this is kind of like the it's a 10
but with 12 things in it so I got this
from my old stylist that I used to go to
when I was blonde and if you're blond I
definitely recommend trying this out
because it made my hair really nice and
shiny and it made it really soft so just
twelve things such as like protects from
chlorine and when in sun damage protects
from blow-drying add shine improves
texture steals color smooth frizz it's
just an instant healthy hair treatment
and I like this stuff I think it smells
good as well I used to talk about this a
lot in my older hair care routines and I
really do like it I think you get it off
Amazon to ask your stylist if she has
heard of this go ahead and take yourself
a screenshot ask her if she has this or
she could pick it up from her like
Beauty Supply that all the salon people
go to and see if she could pick this up
for you I know I only paid about ten or
twelve dollars from my stylist
and then the one product that like never
changes in my hair care routine is this
oil this is the argan oil from nume and
i used to use the macadamia one but i
didn't like that one as much so this one
has been the one I've been going to for
the longest time as you can see I'm like
halfway through the bottle it's good
stuff and I know a lot of people are
like oh new me again but honestly you
guys I would not talk about them as much
as I do if I didn't love their products
obviously from like my hair and stuff
it's really healthy and shiny and I use
only new me hair styling tools and of
course then I mean I highly recommend
the brand I've never had a problem with
them so that's why I always talk about
them so it gets on your nerves I'm sorry
but I love the brand so this makes my
hair super shiny and soft and just so
manageable my hair is never frizzy with
this and I highly recommend it it's good
stuff like I'm not even lying this is my
favorite favorite oil I have ever tried
and I've tried the macadamia one and I
also tried another one that was like a
sample from Sephora Oh Jean or ohan I
don't know how they want to say their
name but this one has been my favorite
one by far and I do have a coupon code
for all the new me stuff that I
mentioned to you guys I always do
they're in the description box in my
videos so if you want to get this for a
good price you can check it below so
when I get on the shower I'll apply like
whatever spray I'm using I'll put this
spray all over my hair underneath all my
ends my roots everywhere and then I'll
take the oil and I'll put a dime sized
amount on my fingers rub it between and
I'll put it all on the ends of my hair
and then I also take it here on the
sides as well sometimes these can get a
little frizzy and crazy so I like to put
a little oil on them and they're just
really nice and tamed and then I will
blow I'm sorry you can hear that car
here's a loud car for some reason and it
gets on my nerves he like wakes me up
all the time
after I put those products in it's time
to blow-dry and I don't have a specific
way that I blow-dry if you saw my get
ready with me weekend morning routine
you saw that I just flip my hair
/ like this I just flip it I never use a
paddle brush on my hair or any kind of
brush when I'm blow-drying because I
just blow dry it completely first and
then I'll take whatever brush and again
I'll start from the bottom and work my
way up to the top I can say I think of
Jake some family but yeah that's I just
blow dry it all over I don't have a
specific pattern I just try to get a
blow dried as quick as possible
and they want to use is this hair dryer
right here it's the new me blow dryer
it's the zebra-print one I loved it so
much I actually got one for my mom and
she loved hers as well so I highly
recommend it you can check the like you
go try to the coupon code below as well
so that's pretty much it for these
shampoos and haircare part but I do want
to mention this product because I love
using it when I'm going on my second
third or fourth day hair so I use the
dry shampoo but sometimes my ends will
get a little bit kind of rough feeling
and not as soft as they normally are so
I go in with this product it's the
kinder platinum recovery polish restore
it and fine and this is really good I'll
take this I'll take a couple pumps on my
hand
and then I'll just rub them together and
I'll put it all over the ends and this
will make your hair get so soft again
it's like it adds moisture right back
into your hair makes it super shiny and
just so manageable so I love this one
I'm going on like third or fourth day
here
so that is it for my haircare video I
