all about my hair carotene this is like
Oh literally hate oh I couldn't I
couldn't spit out literally this is
literally been one of my most requested
videos on Instagram on YouTube
everywhere and I do these every so often
but honestly it's like always including
the same products and I do have some of
the same products in this video as well
that I have been using so I hope you
don't mind that but I'm also gonna show
you some new products as well that I've
been loving and just a little bit of
some different things so I hope you
enjoyed this video I hope it helps you
out my hair let me just tell you it was
a process to get to this length end to
be this healthy so my hair is almost
touching my butt now now that it's
curled it doesn't look like it but it's
almost touching my badonkadonk but that
is it right there
super long if you don't know or if you
haven't seen my videos from the
beginning of my channel I used to have
bleached blonde hair on top and it was
such a process to try to go out the top
layer of my hair because my underneath
was a dark brown so this part was
healthy well up top was super damaged
with bleach and just over dyeing it
basically so it's taking me about a good
two years to get my hair like this and
to get it this healthy and honestly
going brunette is what helped me so much
oh my gosh it helped me so much because
being a blonde and being a dark brunette
like this naturally is just hard work
and it's super damaging to your hair so
just going back to a darker shade it
really helps my hair because I've never
really died I diet probably once every
I'd say three or four months and I have
a full video on the colors that I use
for my hair for my hair guys so if
you're interested in that I will leave
it down below I do a full tutorial on
everything for you so you can check that
out I still use those colors to this day
and a lot of you've been asking on
Instagram recently I've dyed my hair
again I have not it is just the color
that it fades to so that's why I really
like the color that I use by L'Oreal I
get it as Sally's and if you watch that
video you'll see it
but that's why I love it because I love
the way it looks on my first diet and I
love the way it looks when it fades um
so really quickly I want to first
mention to you guys new extensions that
I've been using because again I've had a
lot of questions on this as well and as
mister you've know I've been using a
foxy locks extension and I absolutely
adore this brand this is a little dust
bag that I have for my extensions and I
love it because it just keeps them in
place and instead of me just hanging
them outside of people being like what
the hell is their hair right there for
like some people get freaked out by hair
extensions or no it's one of those
things where if you're not into hair and
makeup you're kind of like why do you
have excess hair in your room and it's
just like don't worry just don't even
worry about it this is the hair that I
use this hair is so dang thick it's so
soft so beautiful and I'm not kidding
this hair is so thick I have some that
are curled because I don't use all the
wefts if I did my hair would be like a
Vava voom voom like intense I use
probably about two or three wefts and it
gives me intense volume and the length
is beautiful I've actually cut off a
couple inches and it's still super super
long so I adore this hair so much I
forget the color that I use but I'll
leave it down below I think it's the
darkest Brown I'm pretty sure and the
tones a little bit off because my hair
is a little bit more red but once you
put it in your hair it blends really
beautifully your extensions can be like
a shade or two off and they'll still
blend with your hair really nicely so
just keep that in mind and I know foxy
locks is really good about color
matching for people like if you send
them a picture of your hair they will
color match for you so I just love this
hair I do love them more than Bellamy as
a lot of you know I did used to work
with them for a while and this year I
just wanted to branch out and try
something new but I really think this
quality hair is so much better and I
love the weft to like the way they're
sewn in they're really really thick as
you can see and the clips are amazing
they don't slide out they just lock in
and they're not going anywhere so like
this is just a two clip weft do you see
how much hair
in this like I'm not even kidding
there's so much hair on these so
definitely check out foxy locks
I will leave my grams and stuff I used
below I believe it's 280 grams 24 inch
that's a lot of hair it's a lot of hair
and I believe they have higher gram sets
as well price on these is really not
that bad I think it's like 170 for these
that I pay and I can't remember but I
absolutely adore them I really I just
wanted to quickly mention them in this
video because it is a haircare video and
a lot of you been asking about these
extensions now moving on to what I use
in the shower this is a really simple
step for me and I want to quickly say
all these problems not to show you guys
are high end I'm a huge advocate of high
end hair products I think that's what
has really honestly helped my hair get
back to normal because I mean I'm using
stuff that's paraben free and fragrance
made and free of all this different
stuff and I just really think that
spending a little extra money on your
haircare is super important I mean your
hair is an important part of your body I
mean it's growing out of your head so I
think it's good just to take better care
of it so I have a little guest here she
wanted to make her cameo but I just
wanted to quickly say that they are all
hand I'm sorry if you're happy with that
but I mean this is what I use so this
one I'm going to show you first thing is
I have been using the matrix biologic
color last line I've been using this for
almost a year now it's been quite a
while this is the color last shampoo for
color-treated hair again this one it
does have no parabens in it and this is
what it looks like I love it I get this
really big size at Ulta and it lasts me
for quite a bit so loved it so much I
when I'm in the shower I wash it twice
so because I don't wash my hair every
single day I use dry shampoo there can
be a lot of buildup in my hair I washed
about 3 or 4 every 3 or 4 days and I
make sure just to wash it twice with the
shampoo just so it gets everything out
it just doesn't feel as clean if I don't
wash it twice and get all of that dry
shampoo and all of that extra residue
and the hairspray out so wash my hair
twice with this and
after that I go in with this macadamia
natural oil deep repair mask I've talked
about this for years
it's raved about for a damn good reason
and it's because it's amazing this is
the only conditioner I use since again I
don't wash it every single day I use
this about twice a week on my hair as my
conditioner and I love it it's expensive
I actually got this jumbo size from CVS
I get mine from CVS and I've never had
an issue with it I know some people have
issues with that or like freaked out by
it but I've never had an issue with it
and this jumbo size lasts me for quite
some time so this just makes your hair
super soft super healthy and just really
nice and moisturized and I love it I
apply this from about my ears down if I
go up towards my roots it will get a
little bit more oily because my hair
naturally gets very very greasy pretty
easily but really quickly I do want to
say that when I was blond I washed my
hair every single day and I used to
always be like I don't know how these
girls go three days Welsh and their hair
its disgusting my hair so greasy after
the first day which it was but I had to
train my hair to not get greasy by
sucking it up and just sticking it out a
few days once you go a few weeks without
washing your hair every single day it
just makes a huge difference you could
start out with your hair and like I'm
not washing it every single day and
going to every other day and then to
every two days to every three days then
I promise you your hair will get used to
it just use some dry shampoo put it up
in a bun I mean there's so many
different cute hairstyles you can do to
not have to wash your hair so just keep
that in mind you can train your hair to
not produce so much oil but if you wash
it every single day the more oily it is
going to get and the more dryer hair's
gonna get as well it's just not healthy
for you
that was my long spiel of what I do in
the shower now when I get out of the
shower I have two products that I have
just loved for the longest time this one
is a Holy Grail product as well the
kinder platinum blow dry spray this
stuff's amazing it makes my hair super
shiny it's also a he protected so I just
sprayed this on before I blow-dry my
hair and it just makes my hair
super super smooth and I just I love it
it smells absolutely delicious day and
it's just one of my favorite products
that I've ever used on my hair and I
think it's really important to use a
thermal protectant before you blow-dry
because that's a lot of heat going on
your hair and then I will also use this
as well right before I blow-dry is the
matrix by a lodge hide your source dry
daily leave-in tonic for a dry hair and
I love this stuff as well it's really
good I'm careful with this though I
spray it just a little bit on my ends
the kinder platinum one this one I spray
like more towards the top and on the
ends so I kind of like just go spray
spray but with this one I focused it
kind of more on the ends and I do two
sprays max if I get this toward my roots
it will make it a little bit more greasy
and kind of weigh down my hair but as
long as I keep this towards the end of
my hair we're good and this stuff is
awesome I love love love that now for my
blow-dryer I have use this for ever I've
worked with new me forever and there's a
reason why I will not leave this brand
and it is because I absolutely adore
them I just I love new me I love my
products I've worked with them literally
since I first started my channel and I
was going to work with other brands but
they're their products just are not
quality like movies in my opinion this
is by far the best blow dryer I've ever
had in my life now it looks like this
because I dropped it I don't want to
talk about it this is amazing it really
makes my hair very shiny doesn't dry it
out and it blow dries it very very
quickly so adore this I'll have
everything I'm mentioning to you in the
description box below and I will see if
I can get coupon codes for new me I know
it's been kind of hectic and I haven't
been able to update my coupon codes but
I'll see if I can get some for you guys
because I wouldn't purchase them without
a coupon code to be quite honest with
you I also want to mention to you guys
my favorite straightener by them I
forgot to get it right now but it is the
nume megastar straightener and I have
loved that straightener ever since it
first came out they sent it to me when
it first came out and I was like oh god
because the other ones that they have
rather kind of cheap II like the Vichy
the vintage fire irons I don't like but
the megastar is like such great quality
I mean it feels so amazing on the
and it really makes your hair nice and
smooth and it doesn't again dry it out
and I've had a ton of subscribers let me
know that they love that from super
curly hair it's a very fine hair to
medium hair kind of like mine everyone
has loved it it's just the best
straightener ever so definitely check
that out and then I've had so many
questions on these curls that I've been
wearing lately just really a big loose
curls and I've been using my new me what
is this the five in one and I've been
using the biggest barrel and I love this
barrel just because it gives me those
really sexy like blue voluminous waves
also love the one that's right below it
which is a 25 millimeter now believe
this is the 32 millimeter those are my
two favorite ones those are the ones I
use the most and yeah I love it and like
I said I'll go like two or three days
with my hair curled like this and
honestly the longer I go without washing
it and I touch up the curls the better
it looks so love this a lot like this is
the best iron ever I like this better
than the titanium ones because I feel
like these ones do not dry out my hair
or cause a lot of breakage so definitely
recommend this line of curling wands so
those are all the heat products that I
use and now onto like random products I
like to touch up with or whatever but
the first one is my dry shampoo I mean
this one's kind of like duh if you've
been watching me for a while ever since
I discovered it there has not been a dry
shampoo to top this bad boy you can get
this on the drugstore this is the only
like constant drugstore product that I
use but it is either batiste dry shampoo
for deep dark brown hair love love love
it doesn't give me a white cast or
anything like that and let me tell you I
can go days without washing my hair with
this Maps 4 to 5 days not even kidding
the stuff is amazing and like I talked
about it all the time for a reason
because it's just it's God's and like
it's amazing so dry shampoo batiste they
have different ones too for blondes
redheads and I think they have
another color I'm pretty sure and then
for just random styling products so the
first thing I want to talk about is this
living proof of style app instant
texture mist okay this is like the
sample size and I got Sephora I'm like
the little checkout line where they
always get you I love this I think I
mentioned this in my favorites video
last month I can't remember but that's
what the little bottle looks like and
it's a thicker mist it's kind of like a
cream in a way and you just spray it on
your hair and it gives you the best
texture of life like I'm not even
kidding it makes everything nice and PC
and it smells really good
this is by far the best one I've ever
tried and I've tried a lot of
texturizing mists I bought my favorite
if you want more of that PC look and
something that's not so put together
that's what you need in your life now
for when I'm running on 3rd 4th day hair
my ends will start to look a little dry
and they need to kind of have like a
little pick-me-up
so I like to use this alternate bamboo
smooth Kendra dry oil my chromis I love
this it's basically an oil in a spray
form it smells so good dilemma it's in a
spray form because it's not as heavy on
my hair whenever I use oils I just pour
out sometimes it can just it's just a
mess but since this is a spray form it's
just so easy to go boom boom and be done
like I can't use a lot of oil in my hair
because again it will make it greasy but
I love to just like put my ends up like
this and spray it like barely any and
I'll just run my fingers down it and
smooth it out and it just looks a lot
more healthy and put together so this
definitely saves my hair from looking
too dry on the ends and looking a little
bit like you know oh you need to wash
your hair and I'm gonna say to alterna
is oh my gosh one of my favorite brands
ever like their hair products are
amazing and they're expensive but holy
crap they're so good I mean I'm not
kidding
everything I've tried from them every
product I have tried has been phenomenal
and you can get this brand from Sephora
it's just perfect
I used to not be a hairspray kind of
girl but I found this one and I was like
mmm I'm being turned to the dark side
now this was again from alterna is the
caviar anti-aging a perfect texture
finishing spray touchable texture and
finish free of parabens polenta lights
and synthetic color color color I love
this hairspray like I'm not kidding I'm
almost out of it I love it so much so
after I comb my hair and they're still
curled I'll just spray this all the way
through like that and then I like my
hair stick and then after about 10
minutes is when I shake it out and then
I get curls like this I love this
because it's not joking when it says
touchable texture and fullness like it
gives you volume and yet you can still
touch your hair I mean someone can run
their fingers through it if they want to
you can brush through it it doesn't feel
like you have hairspray in your hair but
it makes your curls last forever and I
love it like I will seriously just spray
my hair and I will keep spraying keep
spraying because I just love it and I
love the smell of it it's perfect and
it's a nice like fine mist I just have
nothing but good things to say about
this because it's the best hair spray
I've ever tried in my life and then last
but not least I just want to talk about
my brush that looks pretty kind of oh
hello I want to talk about my brush that
looks a little bit you know janky gross
you know whatever this is the detangler
I get mine from Ulta there's a lot of
different type of detanglers like this
but I personally find that this one is
the best it's just called the detangler
and I believe it's like the original one
or something I don't know but I love
this and when I brush out my hair I
always start from the bottom and work my
way up to the top just so I don't pull
down knots from up here and then create
more tangles so that it just adds more
breakage to it because I'm pretty
tender-headed as well so brushing my
hair sometimes sucks but I'll just hold
the ends like this and start brushing it
through and then I will just work my way
up to the top and then I'm good to go
this is the only brush I'll use I will
not use a paddle brush and I will not
use anything else on my hair because it
causes so much breakage and I do use
this one
have wet hair as well and I've noticed a
huge difference with this like it just
glides through your hair so amazingly
and it's just awesome
I've purchased probably six of these
yeah six of them okay guys so with that
is at the floor at my hair care routine
I really hope you enjoyed it
this is just all the products that I use
and I figured I would go ahead and get
this up for you guys cuz I've had so
many questions and I know some of the
products are the same but honestly it's
just because they're amazing and there's
a reason why they're my holy grail and
there's a reason why I always mention
them so everything I mentioned to you in
this video is definitely hair changing
life changing everything I mean I stand
by everything 110 percent I really hope
you guys enjoyed it I hope I wasn't
yelling at you the whole time because
I'm really congested and my ears are
congested so I can't really hear myself
so I'm sorry I'm a little loud but thank
you again for the hundredth time I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did please
give it a thumbs up I would love your
support and don't forget to subscribe to
