to be trying mmm I'm still sick can you
believe it I feel like it's been 300
years but it's only been like a week and
a half but so today we're going to be
trying a new foundation that I found off
of Amazon and a head hell ago reviews
and supposedly this is supposed to be an
intense full coverage foundation like
I'm talking like in freakin 10th
intrigued me so this is a packaging I'm
not too sure why they're two different
colors but they are SPF 30 they're
hypoallergenic this is called a
difficult film studio but is SPF 30 is
hypoallergenic and I actually like the
packaging I think it's really pretty
add two shades to 18 to 11 where bounds
that have a color that will match I'm
going to try it with my regular primers
today because I know I love them and
they work with pretty much every single
foundation so that's what I'm going to
wear today and I'm really excited to try
this out so it does come with a little
instruction panel basically telling you
to use the satin makeup base by their
brand which I'm just going to use my
regular primers and then it says to use
a sponge with this and just start from
the center and work your way out I'm
going to do today I'm going to use my
L'Oreal sponge and we're just going to
see how well this stays on the face and
this better be really full-coverage so
really quickly before you get started I
wear know down below in the comments
have you tried this out what do you
think obviously I'm not going to CH I
post this video but I'm very interested
to see if any of you have tried this out
because they have really good reviews
and I'm going to read you just a little
bit of it real quick it says the
clinically tested extreme covering a
makeup cover was created as the first
bit kind in Europe and one of the first
in the world the license for the
foundation was eventually sold to
Hollywood it contains 50% pigments which
makes it a weapon against skin
imperfection derma Col makeup cover
provides perfect coverage in caps so you
know look even in thin layers and is the
perfect corrector for dark under eyes
unpleasant spots and skin blemishes and
obviously people like me with rosacea it
didn't say that but I figured I'd end it
in there completely covered back me lots
of pigmentation post-surgical
post-surgical bruising a tattoos etc - I
don't have a tattoo it may be used on
the entire face or body for color
correction
darkening or lightening the skin tones
and ensuring ideal balance is widely
used as a professional makeup for photo
shoots or film shoots
modelling at first
occasions this seems really freaking
awesome it's one ounce preservative-free
waterproof and like I said it's for all
skin types so the name is on fine I'm
really excited to try it out and we're
just going to get started so again I do
have the shade 218 this is what the
bottle looks like it's very interesting
it's super small and it's like that
aluminum bottle so like when you push on
it or whatever it does have like finger
indents which I kind of like I would
just play with it all day I feel like
that I do have the shade 211 no that's
what that looks like they both look
exactly the same
very compact easy to travel with all you
have to do is take off the top turn the
top over because there is some foil
right here and you just push this down
and that's what opens the product which
I really like that I think that's
awesome but I'm going to take the shade
218 since I'm pretty dark right now I do
have my loving pan self tanner on in
ultra dark you want to check it out I
always have that self tanner linked down
below I'm just going to no way how is
this light 218 is light what the actual
hell I was not expecting that at all
then to 13th in the even lighter am for
sure thought to 18 would be promising so
I'm just going to swatch it on my face
and see what it does look like wow that
is so light so behind it for this one
this is always a problem when I have
ordering foundations online you never
know what you're gonna get
alright so a since it is pretty light I
am going to take a foundation mixer and
make it darker it's not going to
alternate aware of it or anything but it
is going to help it match my skin a
little bit more so this is the NYX pro
foundation mixer in the shade olive and
again it doesn't alter the foundation or
anything like hella wears all it does is
just add more color to it if you're
wondering the foundations should still
perform the same I've used this in a lot
of different foundations I wasn't
planning on using it today if it was too
light but I you know kind of going to
work with it so I'm going to go ahead
and use my Smashbox primer water and
canon austin and maya fine
primer and then like I told you guys I'm
going to use my L'Oreal sponge to apply
it to what my face so we're just going
to go in wow this is definitely full
coverage oh right so doesn't really have
scent to it but this was a really full
card and it looks really good on the
skin so far not accentuating pores
anything like that I'm excited about
this product oh wow that looks beautiful
it has like a nice natural finish it's
not too matte so I have a lot less on
the back of my hand and that was like a
really intense full coverage finish so
this is what it looks like so far I
think it looks really nice so it does
look like I have foundation on but I
don't think it looks terrible I think
with some powder and concealer it's
going to look really really great and
when we set it into place to just go
look awesome so I'm going to go ahead
and finish the rest of my face and then
I'll be back to give you guys another
update ok guys so I'm going to give you
a little review now that I have all of
my makeup on and I want to say
everything went on really well I did use
a medium coverage concealer which is the
Urban Decay Naked skin
I found that I didn't really even need
to use the Tarte shape tape concealer
that is a very full coverage concealer I
just didn't think it was necessary to
wear this foundation since this
foundation is so full coverage I
personally think it looks really
beautiful on the skin now I did have to
set the rest of my face and what I said
it with was the tarte confidence creamy
powder foundation and medium tan honey I
just used a brush like this is from Too
Faced it's be mr. right brush and I just
dusted it all over the outer perimeter
of my face just to set it because I did
bake under my eyes but I didn't you know
dust it all over my face just added a
little bit more color as well but I
found that if I didn't set it it was a
little sticky so I had to put some
powder on it and now it feels really
nice and matte so far so good the
bronzer that I use is this one it is the
Smashbox bronze light skin perfecting
bronzer in suntan matte I love this they
dont sell it anymore in this packaging
but honestly I couldn't help but use it
because I love it as well
my makeup revolution brow pomade and
blondes I did use this sculpting blow
from models own I use the sculpt color
in here to contour my cheeks I really
really like that sculpt powder and then
for blush I used this la girl just
playful blush which is so pretty
and of course for my highlight I had to
use my spotlighted palette in pearl I
absolutely adore this palette so much
and I can't get enough of it I keep it
in my purse that's how much I love it so
that's I have on my face also I do have
on the Jeffrey star man emu a at the
collaboration this is in I'm shook I'm
really liking the foundation so far I'll
get up close so you guys can see not
really accentuating my pores or anything
obviously it looks like I have makeup on
but it doesn't look crazy it just kind
of glided over my texture and my pores
look at that glow of my spot so the time
right now is 3:18 I'm going to wear this
throughout the day keep you guys updated
going to take you out into sunlight let
you see what it looks like as well
actually going to go pick up my
engagement ring I'm so excited because
just a couple days after I got engaged I
had to go get resized and they've had it
for forever now I finally get it back
thumbs up so far can't wait to see how
it wears it does feel pretty lightweight
and I think I've hit all the bullet
points so yeah let's just go ahead and
wear this throughout the day okay guys
so I'm going to give you an update on
the foundation I thought I had my
blotting sheets with me I normally do
but I can't find them but I just got to
forbidding them and driving around and
this is what the foundation looks like
it's currently 633 right now and I feel
like it does look good I'm going a
little bit shiny just something that I
definitely want to blot it looks a
little glowy I mean some people might
like that but I don't like looking very
glowy in my t-zone anyway so it's been
about three hours time to blot save as'
what do you think in this foundation it
looks very good does it
Haley I like it smooth doesn't look
cakey at all
see okay now being a cyclone let's get
alright we've got an approval he's
usually honest about foundations of
failure cakey so going off so far going
to do a little blotting and then we'll
begin I will check my game with you guys
in just a few hours my mom hey guys so
I'm back for my final check-in and let
me tell you what time it is
it is eleven fifty seven right now and I
have to say I really love this
foundation I think it lasted so well
throughout the day even though I'm a
little shiny right now it could be worse
like I haven't powdered my face at all I
think it looks really glowy in these
lights you can kind of see a little bit
of texture and everything that's just
because I have such harsh lights on my
face right now but if foundation looks
so good for the wear time I mean I think
it looks awesome I even think I'm going
to wear this for my engagement pictures
on Friday
it's a Friday yet I'm going back and
forth to do some thinking of what makeup
I want to wear and going back and forth
with if I want to wear the wet and wild
photo focus or if I want to wear this
one so I just did the flash test and it
doesn't look bad I mean it looks lighter
than my actual body because it is
actually lighter than my body that's one
thing that Davis did point out while we
were out and about when we were out in
the Sun he looked at me and he was like
let me see let me tell you what I think
real quick and I was like oh god it's
going let's take you or something in the
sunlight like I know that sunlight when
it hits your face is the worst lighting
ever and he was like no it's just
lighter than your body does like yeah it
is any get the right shade so I also got
this in the mail today it's the derma
Col Mac control makeup base and it's
oil-free long-lasting anti-shine aside
so just saying 18 hours I will be trying
this out for you guys and letting you
know what I think because it's all about
mattifying primer really quickly since I
did not powder I'm going to do just a
little bit of powder on my face I don't
have my blotting sheets I literally
don't know where they went any like a
year supply of blotting sheets cuz I
have no idea where they would but I want
to see what looks like when I put some
more powder over top even though I would
recommend blotting off the oil that's on
your face and then powdering but my
lipstick rubbed off because
have Froyo and I needed to wipe the
chocolate offline oh so this is what it
looks like with powder honestly it
doesn't look that at all normally
foundations will get super cakey here in
the crease of my nose and it doesn't
look bad at all I'm not getting like any
creasing in there I'm definitely gonna
have to get a different shade for when
I'm really self-tan but I think this is
so beautiful on the skin and it wears
really really well and I love it so let
me know you guys think down below in the
comments how do you think you wore
throughout the day do you think it looks
good on the skin you know are we on the
same page I know the colors off I'm
sorry about that but you know ordering
foundations online is really hard okay
especially when you're like me and
constantly like oh I want to be self tan
this day oh I don't want to be self tan
this day and charger by the colors match
so I hope you enjoyed this video thank
you guys so much for watching don't

I will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
