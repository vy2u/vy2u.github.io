another different video but I am so
excited because a ton of British candy
was at my door and I was like yes goals
I am so excited I really wanted to try
all these out on camera for you guys I
have been watching so many like British
tried American candy like crazy I'm
watching so many of those videos and I
just think they're so much fun and I
think they're hilarious so I wanted to
do this for you guys today I'm gonna
rate them from one to ten let's get into
it the first one I'm super excited to
try out is wine gums and it says gummy
candies with natural fruit flavors and
I'm not even gonna lie I got this cuz I
was like ooh I like wine and I was like
well there's probably not wine in the
gummies oh my god these are huge just
pickled big they are
okay I like oh oh they know like they're
kind of hard yeah right hard I like them
I like that kind of grape flavor they're
just sick gin wait I love gin oh wait
maybe it's not alcohol I will say wait
okay wine gin
this has to be my kind of gummy it it
tastes like fruit gummies and I like
fruit gummies so I give them a 7 out of
10 just because they are so hard to chew
okay so the next thing is this Candyland
chewy nougat and to me this looks like a
Laffy Taffy that we have here in states
and um let's see what's in it
raspberry in vanilla flavored nougat
with peanuts okay well actually tackies
don't have peanuts in them so I'm
nervous to try this one of my middle I'm
oh I don't what to get though I'm not
gonna lie it looks a little gross okay
don't like that one nope Oh Momo Oh
reminds me of something but it's just
it's not good so I don't like I don't
like the texture of it - it tastes like
a like a marshmallow a whipped thing
definitely not Laffy Taffy let me just
say so I get that one like a - let's
start with something that I might like
and these are the Maltesers these are
the ones that everybody saying there
were they're comparing these two the
whoppers and I love me some whoppers oh
hello hello look Wow so that's what they
look like oh my god mmm
that chocolate is good that was better
than the whopper the chocolate is
amazing the chocolate is so much better
than American chocolate I'm not gonna
lie it is Oh
next I have these katie'll and
refreshers and it's described as a hard
tablet formed fruity flavored fizzy
sweets called sweets
so did they look like never I don't
think I've ever had anything like is
fizzy in your mouth please look like a
like sweet tart first what are they
called
what are these around you have
that's our whoo yeah this week tarts I
think it's sweet tart T's around me a
little bit more sour though I would
prefer the sweet tarts but these are
pretty good they just kind of like give
me a sour face so I probably give them
like a six I think they're pretty good
though this is something I'm so insanely
excited about and these are Irish butter
tall fees and it's creamy Irish butter
topping made to a traditional recipes
it's a little bit of heaven do not do
these not look amazing like oh my gosh I
need to travel the world I swear and try
it not even candy just like oh it smells
so good I'm so excited it's probably a
bad thing because there's this big-ass
bag I love stuff with this okay how do
you eat these there's two already you
suck on I think it's not coming because
this is painful
smell that it smells good you can't have
one but you can smell it mmm
these are a ten so freaking then that
was amazing okay moving on to another
gummy these are called randoms and
thereby grown trees I'm sorry if I said
that wrong um but I love it I love that
they're called sweets I like I just love
that so yeah and so they look like sick
little gummy just tied about these two I
have high hopes
oh I wonder why they're double sided
what is that okay we'll try this one
what in the heck is in there you see it
what is that I hope that's normal
okay
I really got burst of flavor hell yeah
that is good if you like gummies you
would love this this reminds me of like
governs I used to eat as a child and I
would get so much trouble for cause I'll
eat like five bags of them I'm gonna try
this little little rocket ship spaceship
my marshmallow dude these are good these
are I would get these designer 10
they're really good on to the one I'm
probably most excited about I love
chocolate so this is just fun this is
called arrow arrow I guess that's it
they have seven biscuits in it I love
special a biscuits huh okay we're just
gonna we're just going to try it 99
calories like some of that probably per
wafer but that's okay
oh I like that individually packaged
that's cool okay let's see there's some
Natal they look like little mini KitKat
bars
I like them but I don't know they kind
of just taste like regular just
chocolate I would give those like a four
um I personally couldn't eat those all
the time but they're pretty good but
they're nothing like amazing I feel like
but hey guys moving on to the last kind
of fruit thing this is the that's that
same brand so those are probably gonna
be good
same brand as the random and they're
called fruit gums
that's pretty a pretty simple and
exploit the self explainatory isn't it I
don't know if I like it that they're
wrapped in a oh these are hard so they
look like this I don't want to yellow
and I don't like yellow oh just come a
little thing like this I definitely like
the randoms better like a hundred times
better then the fruit gums these are
just really hard and I don't really like
the flavor to be quite honest with you
so yeah these are these are probably
like a two for me I don't really open
too much so this next one I'm really
excited to try this is the coffee crisp
and it just looks absolutely delicious
looks like a giant over spar somebody's
kind of fill so I felt really
something's kind of melted so I had to
stick them in the freezer so they're
like breaking off but let's let's try it
mm oh yeah that is amazing I love things
with a wafer this is so so freakin good
this I don't know which was my favorite
wow this is really good I wish we had
this in this date so it's probably a
good thing we don't have it because I
would eat these all the freaking time
wow these are good coffee Chris I get
that adoption that's amazing next one I
have no idea what to even expect from
this it's a drifter and I tried looking
for an explanation on it like seeing
what it is or a description just like a
little tux bar let's see
I get this guy with six out of ten just
because I don't know it's kind of like a
weird it's just it's a beer bar like I
don't happen looks like I have wipers in
it and then some sort of like caramel
substance I don't know it's not bad at
all tasting but it doesn't really taste
like anything different to me I didn't
really not good stuff six out of ten and
then the last one we have is this
Cadbury flake and this is kind of
crumbled I don't know this supposed to
be like that probably honestly because
of oh wow look at the language on the
back of this yeah I can't read that at
all that's what that looks like I'm
excited about this one oh hello this one
definitely just like broke all over cuz
it melted Oh sucks okay just take a
little bite of this most is supposed to
be I wonder if because it says peel and
enjoy I went too fast like a peeling
chocolate mmm and it's a good chocolate
but it it's just like a stick of
chocolate so I'm gonna give this one
like an 8 out of 10 just because it's a
good like bark of chocolate but there's
nothing really special about it if it is
just chocolate themselves favorites
favorites favorites were the crock
coffee Chris the oh oh yeah this is so
good the Irish butter toffee this is
amazing the trouble the Maltesers yep
