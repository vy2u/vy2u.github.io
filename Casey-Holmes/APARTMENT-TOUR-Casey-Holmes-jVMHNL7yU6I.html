us in the thickest me
hey guys so today's video is going to be
a highly requested video and it is my
apartment tour and this has been
requested ever since I moved into this
place almost two years ago I think it
was it's been a while so I figured now
it's fall time I got some fall decor and
I figured I would show you guys so
because I really like the way that looks
right now also if you guys are wondering
if I don't mention something in this
video that you want you can always take
a screenshot and upload it to the hunt I
don't know if you guys know but the hunt
does have decor items on there that
people can help you find I mentioned
that a few favorite videos back and I
still use it to this day and it's just a
really helpful app to have so if you
guys are interested in downloading the
hunt I'll leave the link down below in
the description box if you guys want to
check it out and maybe download it and
don't forget to follow me because I'm on
the hunt for some shirts right now so
help yeah yeah I really hope you guys
enjoy this video and let's get started
ok first we're going to start off with
the living room which I'm so excited
about because as you can see I have fall
decor out all my fault Accor is from
Pier one so here for this table I got my
furniture at rooms to go by the way if
you're wondering a couple years ago but
this is what my little pumpkins look
like again they're from pure one the
lighted one is in the middle the other
ones don't light then I got these cute
little pillows again from Pier one and
then I have some more stuff over here
this is actually a pair of pants that
eli tomac signed for me which I was so
excited about this was a couple years
ago but I just keep them in that little
shadow box then I keep my iPad dog toys
you'll see a lot of those and then this
is my couch again I love the colors of
these my curtains match the couch pretty
much they're just a darker Brown and I
got those from Walmart I believe and
then over here I have this picture of me
and Daisy if you follow my blog in the
past then you've seen that and then I
also have a big picture right here which
I got off of hautelook a lot of things I
get off of hautelook just because they
have really great deals so I loved this
with my couch it was just
perfect exactly what I needed to fill
that whole space up then I have a little
table right here I got off of like
Amazon and then I have a big C which I
got off of Etsy this cute little fall
vase is from here one I just purchased
the whole thing from there I was like
okay I love everything about it
give me the whole thing and then I dig
at the sign from HauteLook as well it
just means life is beautiful then I have
my TV and my system down there and then
some magazines and such then up here
like this part I haven't finished yet I
need to fill up this side and the other
but this is a picture of Daisy last
Christmas and I just love it
and then moving over here we have
another picture of Daisy
whenever Georgia had that really big
snowstorm so we just went outside and
played and it got this picture I
absolutely loved it and then I got this
little sign from I don't know where I
got it I'm not too sure but it's really
cute I love it and the brown definitely
goes like with this room I like for my
home to feel really homey so like I need
it to feel warm and comforting and not
stuck-up you know what I mean like I
can't have to moderate of a home it
needs to be kind of southern very warm
and just I don't know feel good when
you're in it and then you have Daisy's
little Bowl and then Lily's lily has to
have a special bowl since she eats
really fast so that's what's in there
moving on to the bedroom now you'll see
my living room is brown my makeup rooms
white and then this one has black
furniture I got my bed frame from
HauteLook as well if you lift up the
pillows you can kind of see it has three
different slots so that's just what that
looks like the flowers are from
Marshalls
again this painting is from look and
then I have a lot of question on these
bins in my last video these are actually
from Big Lots I got them right before
school season started and I wanted to
get another one but they sold out so I
got those at Big Lots when they had them
and loved it this little tray I actually
made for a DIY if you're interested in
that I'll leave it in the description
box below but I just keep like little
lotions and deodorant and a perfume then
I have my
yuuji film and another nice body butter
then right here this is just temporary I
have a clothing rack until I move all of
my false stuff into my closet this is
where most of that is staying because
right now I don't have room and then
these two paintings again are from look
I'm telling you guys I always always
always I'm on there I like the fact of
having black furniture that way I can do
like pops of color with like paintings
or flowers anything like that and I've
had a lot of questions on this mirror
it's actually from Ikea it is huge and
it was only $100 it is so nice
definitely recommend you guys checking
out IKEA for nice mirrors like that
moving around over here I have this
little jar that I got from Marshalls
with some lush stuff as well as this one
I hear down there some more lush stuff
these flowers I got from Hobby Lobby the
reason why I got those is because I got
lilies and daisies for my dog lily and
Daisy and then I also got this little
thing from I believe it was Marshalls
yes pretty sure and then over here you
have my dresser this is from Ikea I
really really love it super sleek in
black it's just one of my favorites all
that stuff on top I can't figure out
where I'm putting these frames or these
roses and that is close I got to get
back to friends and then right up top I
have my TV which honestly I never use
because I never sit in here and watch TV
but I need to get back on it it really
comes in handy when I'm sick and stuff
though because it's just right in here
and if you guys don't know I have the
bed that lifts up and down and I'm
obsessed with it so it's like a little
theater in here right alright now we're
going to go ahead and move on to the
bathroom I got my shower curtain from I
have no idea but this little guy is from
Bethany on I needed some more storage so
I got that the flowers are from
Marshalls and if you guys can see this
frame right here this is actually from a
DIY that I did so again I'll leave that
video down below and yeah this is just
what it looks like I have a little
candle and yeah nothing too exciting
about the bathroom right and then we
have this memory foam mat which are my
favorites because they feel so good
now moving on to the place that I love
this is my closet I keep my towels up
top again I have two of those bins from
Big Lots and yeah this is what my closet
looks like you guys have never seen
inside of it so it's a little bit packed
but it's pretty organized if I must say
so myself
so like down here I have all shorts all
my pants go back there then I have
dresses I go to rompers and then down
here I have kimonos and these are all
casual tank tops then back up here I
have dressy tank tops casual shirts
dressy shirts then longer sleeve shirts
so that's how it goes up there those
bins are what store my fall clothing so
that's my closet it's a little bit
crammed but I'm trying to figure out
different organization stuff for this so
if you guys have any tips let me know
alright moving to the other side of the
apartment you guys have seen this a
million times is just where I film
courses is my makeup room filming room
slash office so all of these shoe
shelves are from Ikea IKEA is one of the
best places to get shelving units and
organization items because they're not
that expensive I do have a detailed room
tour if you guys want to see it I will
leave it down below in the description
box but not much has changed you know
basically all of the furniture is from
Ikea - this little rack right here that
I keep my clutches on and my hats on
that is actually from what is it called
the beth and beyond my jewelry hoarders
are from pure one as well but yeah i'll
leave that video that i talked in detail
about all this stuff down below in the
description box so you guys can check it
out if you're interested so now we're
moving on to the guest bathroom and this
little sign right here is actually from
Big Lots it says happiness is a journey
not a destination which I'm obsessed
with and then we have this shower
curtain with little frogs as the hangars
and then I have this painting as well
I'm pretty sure is it from huh look I
don't know where else I would get that
but I got that off of hautelook and then
I have a spray tan system right here and
yeah just keep it pretty simple and
clean because I don't want it to be
overwhelming for guests really simple
kitchen you guys I have an extra nice
set that I'm giving to a friend but I
keep like my protein in here obviously I
do have my nutribullet some plastic cups
some knives sets and I just got these
from Pier one and look at it it says
drink up which is so funny and then in
here I just have bowls and plates I need
to get new plates but I've been kind of
lazy I had ordered plates to go with
this but they were like the size of my
hand so I was like that's not going to
work out so they don't match but I have
shaker cups glasses galore and yeah
that's pretty much it for that and then
like down here I have pots and pans that
need to be organized because obviously I
don't know how to organize them and then
here I have a ton of cleaning supplies
so I'm like a cleaning supplies hoarder
I just I love cleaning supplies so this
is my pantry I don't really keep it too
packed I mean I do what I can
oh and if you guys are wondering this is
great storage for your kitchen it's a
shoe holder I guess you call them and
you could just hang it up in your pantry
for extra storage for stuff and like
take the stuff out of boxes and put them
in this it just saves so much room I
love it and then in there I just have my
laundry room and I don't know if you
guys can see but I have some extra fall
decor up top which I really love but
trying to figure out what to put up
there and now that it's holiday season
it's like the perfect time and then we
have the fridge so that's how my fridge
looks like it's actually kind of packed
this is the first time it's been packed
before so let's just soak it in and
enjoy it because that never happens the
light is out in this part of the hall
but this is a little leash holder and it
says play hard I'm a lucky dog it just
has all my dogs leashes and collars and
stuff on there
and then over here a mail rack with my
sunglasses and my keys and then my purse
and then I keep my flip-flops here I
usually kick my shoes off here because I
really don't like walking around my
apartment with my shoes on okay guys so
that is it for this video I really hope
you enjoyed it
and don't forget to give it a thumbs up
if you did like it and I will see you
all in my next video bye
tonight cruising comes strolling about
