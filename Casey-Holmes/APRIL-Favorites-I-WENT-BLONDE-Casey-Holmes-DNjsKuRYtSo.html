not even talk about favorites right now
and talk about this hair as most of you
know if you follow me on Instagram and
Twitter I went lighter with my hair for
summer I was really over the brunette
and I kind of just want to switch things
up a little bit and I was like if we're
gonna do it we're gonna do it dramatic
and we're gonna go ahead and just get it
over with and I knew I wanted to kind of
go back blonde now I will say this is
not deep blonde that I want this is too
brassy for me and a little too yellow
but it is a process especially with my
hair my hair absolutely despises blond
it despises bleach everything it will go
brassy like that like it takes a good
few times for me to get my hair a nice
pretty blond color and for me I'm
thinking I'm gonna like more of an ashy
blonde on myself just so it's not like
so bleached blonde you know because I'm
not really into super bleach um but I
think once I get the brassiness
and the yellow out of this color and
once we get it to the color that I want
I will really really love it so if
you're wondering this isn't like the
final color I'm just in the process of
going lighter it does take some time
especially if you don't want to damage
your hair I will have a full video on
how we did this because I did go to a
stylist and she let me know some of the
products that she used and I also have
some new extensions coming in which I'm
really excited about so I'm gonna make
it like a two-in-one video of showing
you how to put in extensions and also
talking about the hair color to those of
you who have said really nice things on
my Instagram a thank you so much I adore
you you are so sweet it is definitely a
big transition I know some people love
it or some people hate it
I know brunette is my color I love being
a brunette brunette is very sultry and
sexy but I just wanted to kind of have
fun and I wanted to go lighter and like
I said once I get this to the color that
I want will be it will be doing good but
right now it's not the color that I want
I want it more ashy and not so brassy
actually not brassy let's get it
together if you don't like the hair just
you know just be nice be nice but I mean
you can't blame a girl for wanting a
chain
I do have quite a bit of favours to show
you guys and it's kind of a mixture of
makeup hair accessories and music
because we got to have the music cuz I
did not do a favorites video last month
so I was like hey I know what I've been
loving this April let's get it together
so first off let's just talk about
primers and stuff I've been loving so my
go-to primer duo has been first off I've
been using in the Too Faced hangover RX
replenishing face primer I really like
this because whenever I do my skincare
in the morning by the way I've got it
I'm filling with a new lens can you guys
tell is it better is not good I love
this because I do my skincare in the
morning and I usually don't do my makeup
right after I do my skincare so I like
to use this to kind of like replenish my
skin make it moisturize before I put on
any makeup so this is great for that
it's silicone free and I just love it it
does have a pump which i thought was
really great and I love the packaging of
this I've been using it seriously all
the month and then to a modify this pin
because I do need something to mattify I
have been loving this makeup forever
step one skin equalizer it's the
mattifier oh it's so good you need a
little bit of this and it goes such a
long way and I just love it I put it
right here all in my teeth I hit my nose
I got it right here all in my t-zone and
it's perfect
I think this will last you quite a very
long time it is one fluid ounce but like
I said you just need the smallest amount
and it's basically like the Becca primer
but it's not as dry and I said that in
my Sephora haul but it really truly is
just like it the formula of it is very
very similar but the way that it dries
and sets on the skin is just a little
bit different because it's not as drying
and like I mean the Becca one really
keeps you mad and if you're not careful
with it it will look flaky and all that
other stuff but this one is perfect so
if the Becca one didn't work for you
definitely try out this new makeup
forever SEK one modifier it is
phenomenal so since I did go lighter
with my hair I've been doing a new brow
routine so I decided to try some new
products out the first product I got is
this Tarte Amazonian clay waterproof
brow pencil and it is sorry I forgot
that I have this on
focus so it just looks like this it is a
duel and did thing it has a spoolie on
the end and then the product right here
I really like this this one's in the
shade full of taupe it's in the shape
taupe and I like it that's the color of
it right there
what I like to use this for is I will
spoolie up my brows and then just fill
in the first part right here with this
so I've just filled this part in and
then brush it out with this because I
feel like this blends a lot better than
the Anastasia brow is in my personal
opinion I think it does so I like to
just blend that out and then I will go
in with the anasazi a dip brow pomade in
taupe I love this I have to admit I was
scared to use it because ever I was like
okay if you used too much it's gonna
look like crazy brows and you just need
to be careful but I honestly haven't
been that careful with it and I haven't
overdone my brows this is what I have to
fill in the rest of my brow and I just I
really really really love what I'll do
is I'll dip my brush in here and then
put on the excess on the lid and then
just fill in my brows and then dip back
into the lid and it's just perfect so it
does stay on forever and I love the
packaging of this I think it's really
chic and yeah I just I really love this
I think it's really nice and then also I
have been setting my brows with D clear
brow gel from Anastacio because I did
have the brunette one which looks like
this
but it looks when I use this when I went
lighter it looks a little odd just
because the color and everything it just
doesn't work so I've been using the
clear brow gel and I love it I mean the
brows stay in place they don't feel like
stiff like to stuff where you can't like
touch them and they feel like brows but
it keeps all the brow hairs in place so
I love it again this is just the clear
brow gel and it's phenomenal okay let's
talk about contouring real quick I have
been obsessed with this Marc Jacobs duo
this is the 40 mirage filter something
about this is supposed to make you look
Instagram flawless I don't know I really
don't care about all that I think that's
all just think it has a yellow tone
powder right here and then your contour
shade here I love this yellow toned
powder because it's really smooth and
just blends into the skin so nicely and
it really leaves a like airbrushed
finish underneath your
eyes and then this contour contour this
contour shade is perfect it just has the
right amount of ashy tones in it and
it's not - Ashley - where kind of looks
tickly and it's not too warm where it
looks like a bronzer I mean it's just
the perfect contour shade I do have it
in my contour line today it blends out
so well and it's just so good on the
face this whole palette I love and I
love the packaging like it it's just so
it's so pretty
I love it and I've also been loving my
bronzer I went back to this bronzer I've
had it in my drawers for a while I used
it a lot last year and this is my Dior
and nude skin annoy the Dior skin in
nude tan and 0:03 yes it's hard to read
it because everything is mirrored on the
back but I love this - runs my skin it
just has a nice warm tone to it it is a
little bit more of a terra cotta bronzer
I really really love it just be careful
with it because it does have that orange
undertone to it but it blends out like a
dream I have it on the high points of my
face today and just to warm up the skin
and I think it looks really really good
and for blush I have been using my
Smashbox blush in heartbreak I got this
in my Sephora haul as well and I love it
I'm wearing it today it's just a very
nice neutral blush and it just has the
right amount of pink it just looks so
natural and pretty like I adore this
color look how pretty the blends not
really well and just makes everything
looking nice and smooth I wouldn't say
that it lasts a really long time though
that's kind of a downfall of it but I
mean I I really really like it I would
take it on the go and kind of touch up
need B and then this is the last that
makeup product that I have this is the
makeup forever pro sculpting a duo in
number two I have been using this
specifically for the highlight shade and
this it is so pretty
very very similar to heatwave by a
sailor if you did not have the chance to
pick it up but I absolutely adore it now
if you're not careful it will like be a
little too intense and just like BAM on
your face you have it on today as you
can see right here and I just love it I
love gold toned highlighters I think
they're really pretty especially for
spring and summer so I've been loving it
and I have
really dipped into the bronzer much just
because I haven't really had time to
just sit down an experiment but it's a
very very terracotta bronzer so just be
careful but the highlight in it is
freaking amazing and I didn't love it
okay now we're gonna go ahead and move
on to more body stuff this is something
from lush that I did not think I would
like but I've ended up falling in love
with it is the dhih fluff strawberry
shaving soap and it says we looked up
our shaving soap okay I can't read too
much for the script off but it says
strawberries rose hip oil and coconut
butter to leave you silky smooth and
smelling sweet this smells just like the
strawberry fields forever massage bar
I'm obsessed with the smell that stuff
and this smells just like it not kidding
when I say I love it because I only have
a little bit left and sometimes whenever
I used to have tons like this of lush
stuff in my bathroom I would never use
it I love it it leaves your legs so soft
it is perfect for right before you're
about to self tan and you could just
shake your legs with it in your arms and
it is so good it leaves your skin so
moisturize and it doesn't feel drying so
absolutely love this I will definitely
have to repurchase that so the next
shower
item I want to talk about is something
that I honestly did not think house
gonna like and just ended up loving it
is the cool Amazon rain the sugar cane
scrub my bath and Bodyworks first off I
love sugar scrubs because I feel like
they don't dry out my skin as much as
sea salt scrubs sea salt scrubs are just
waiting to drying for my skin and my
skin cannot handle it but sure scrubs
are perfect for me I absolutely adore
them and this smell is like oh god Lee I
mean a holy cannoli oh you can't be it
it's so good so I do love the eucalyptus
scrub by Bath and Body Works because
it's very very it is better than this
one if I have to compare both the
eucalyptus one is a little bit more
moisturizing and has more oil and I feel
but this one is great for like day to
day use if you don't want to use your
eucalyptus one because like I said it
does have more oil in it at least I feel
like but this is great leaves your skin
really really smooth and smells
absolutely delicious so check these out
from Beth and Bodyworks I think they're
amazing and I love the
convenience of having them and like a
squeezy to the eucalyptus scrubs in a
jar
so sometimes it's kind of like you have
to take your hands and then it just kind
of gets annoying but this is a squeezy
tube and it's perfect
and yeah back that Marty works killed it
they just they kill it every single time
I don't know how but they do and then if
her hair I was getting my hair lightened
and she used this on me and I was like
that smells so good I love it what is
that she told me it was like this
all-in-one product by pure ology and I
was like oh my god it's so so good and
she was blow-drying my hair and I was
like no but seriously it's smell so good
I need it in my life so I ended up going
to Ulta and purchasing it it is the pure
ology color fanatic multitasking a hair
beautifier
for a perfecting color treated hair
first off this does a lot of stuff it
Prime's for text and perfects and I mean
there's 21 things that it does and I
love this for being my all-in-one
product instead of using like two or
three products like I used to on my hair
and it's a really nice formula it's just
a little bit runny but this smell though
this smell you guys is oh it's so good
if you can stop it to your old tub spray
a little bit of this on your hand and
just smell it
you will not want to be without it so I
definitely recommend it though I feel
like my hair stays really nice and
smooth with this and its really
protected from all the blow drying and
stuff that I do even though it is
lighter now so love this definitely
check it out I mean it is pure ology but
pure ology is a really great brand and I
highly recommend them so if it's worth
this large I promise then that last but
not least before we get onto accessories
and music I have been back to loving my
misty or blooming bouquet perfume let me
tell you this stuff smells so good it is
a perfect spring perfume it just smells
floral and just fresh and amazing so it
is a pricey perfume but I've had this
since last year and I've only gone down
a little bit that's probably because I
have way too many perfumes but it smells
so good if you're looking
for that perfect perfume this is it now
it doesn't last a very long time in my
opinion I have another one by Dior that
lasts a long time
this one doesn't but I mean honestly I
don't mind spraying this on my body
throughout the day because it just
smells so freakin good the Miss Dior
blooming bouquet is I bow down to it I
really really want to talk about some
things that happen this month that were
just amazing and it's not even the end
of April and I had just like one of the
most amazing months of my life
so I went to LA one of the best trips
I've ever had I had some meetings out
there the meetings look so great I mean
I just that filled my heart up that work
is going so good right now another thing
is I went to get more concert with my
sister at Lachey and I met kit Moore and
I was like oh my god he was so nice
such a gentleman so oh my god you guys
have to listen to his music if you
haven't I love him I'm going to shaky
boots and Kennesaw in May and he'll also
be there so excited to see him perform
there but if you want to see the picture
of us here it is right here and I'm
obsessed with him he's so fine I mean oh
my Jesus he is honestly it's so freaking
attractive I'm just like oh I got to get
away from you because I'm gonna try to
marry you and I can't do that right now
that was so much fun and then I also
this past Saturday hit nine hundred
thousand subscribers like it's so crazy
oh my god it makes me emotional thinking
about it I cannot believe I am less than
a hundred thousand subscribers away from

I need those it took me a couple times
to go back on the site and finally get
them but I mean this is like the epitome
of me I just I love them they're off I
can't see it no words no words okay so
this time I figured I would bring my
beats pill to play for the music because
I kind of wanted to throw it back a
little bit so the first song is actually

my favorite song ever that I have ever
