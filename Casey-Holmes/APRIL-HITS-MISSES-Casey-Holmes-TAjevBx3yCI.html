today I'm going to be filming my April
hits and misses these are all the things
that I was loving during the month of
April and I have quite a few products to
mention to you guys so I'm really
excited to share them with you
so if you want to see all of my
favorites and definitely keep watching
and also if you're not subscribed be
sure you go ahead and click that
subscribe button and give this video a
thumbs up for favorite videos because I
love favorite videos you guys seem to
love favorite videos and there's always
music favorites at the end which is
probably my favorite to film so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and let's
just go ahead and get started really
quickly before I get into everything I'm
loving I want to mention why I'm wearing
on my lips because I'm going to forget
what it is everything I have on is this
Mac retro matte liquid lip color and
topped with brandy this is so pretty I
feel very small right now but it's okay
and then in the center I do have the
Jeffrey star in Maine EMU a collab and
this is the liquid lip in daddy I think
this goes so well with this lip color
and it's just a little hint of lightness
in the middle just to kind of add some
more dimension and break it up and then
for a gloss I did use E Kevin a quant
molten lip color in the shade cyber opal
just because my lips are so dry I had to
use it so yeah this is on top and this
is really pretty on pretty much any lip
color it just adds nice shine okay so
let's just go ahead and get started I
don't really have a specific order that
I'm going to go in I'm just going to
pick up some things let you know if I
love them have everything on this little
chair right now because I got rid of all
my tables and stuff in like a yard sale
and since removing like things are just
leaving the room pretty quickly so I'm
working with what I got so the first
thing I want to shout out is the
Victoria's Secret bombshell perfume
guide who remembers me talking about
this a long time ago I used to love this
perfume and then they discontinued it
like I wouldn't use my smaller perfume
for the longest time because I was like
no like it's it's discontinued I'll
never be able to get it again but they
came back out with it and whoo this time
I bought the huge bottle because I was
like you know what I have to have it in
my life it's bringing back so many
memories just a smell it's like very
fruity and very feminine it's such a
flirty perfume great for summer the name
bombshell is exactly what it is it's
just amazing and then another thing that
I actually mentioned in my Sephora haul
recently is this Sephora nourishing
mousse body oil this is so good I love
oils and like having them on my skin but
I don't use heavy oils unless it's like
at night when I'm up into the bed so I
can throw on some pants and like a
longer top so that it doesn't get
everywhere because they soak into the
skin I love this because it is a moose
oil and when you put it on your body it
does have that glowy look but it dries
down so quickly that you can wear it in
the daytime and it's very moisturizing
so I love this I've been using it ever
since I got it and I think it's just
great and easy to work with and it's not
going to leave that really intense film
on the top of your skin like a lot of
oils do so the next item that I got at
Sephora haul that I have to mention to
you guys is this a Natasha Genoa
eyeshadow palette in number 13 I'm
wearing one shade on my eye right now
I'm wearing this one wearing this all in
my crease and then the darker Brown
right here or this to my knee up in LA
no the first time I was using it and it
applied so well I'm telling you I just
love her eyeshadows I'm obviously blown
away every single time I think this is
so beautiful and I get a lot of
compliments from you guys saying you
loves my makeup you love the green
because I had this in the center it's
just a great go-to palette to have for
all of the neutrals that I need but then
also a light pops of color with this or
with this color I just cannot say enough
good things about her eyeshadows because
they're so easy to blend which makes me
enjoy putting on makeup you don't I mean
if I use the eye shadow palette that is
hard to blend I'm mad you know it goes
like why are you not working always so
much fun to use her eyeshadows in my
personal opinion I think they're worth
the money this is definitely a staple
palette for me now look at that you
can't beat it you guys next up is a new
eyeshadow primer guys and loving and I
never thought I would say I have a new
eyeshadow primer that I'm loving but
this one has really stole show this
month to do these Smashbox photo-finish
lid primer this is so good this was in
the shade light and at first I didn't
know how I would feel because it is kind
of a thicker consistency this reminds me
so much of Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
but that's what it looks like when you
put it on your lid a little bit goes a
long way and since it does have that
it really does counteract any kind of
discoloration any redness that you might
have but you definitely definitely
definitely want to set this with a
powder if you have oily eyelids I would
not just leave it and let it go I would
go ahead set it in place with like a
powder that's color of your skin you can
use a cream eyeshadow to set it because
I feel like if I didn't set this it
would crease just because it is so
creamy but once I said with a powder and
put my eyeshadows on top I'm good I have
not noticed any creasing and I just love
the fact that it counteracts everything
on my eyes it's just awesome still love
my NARS eyeshadow primer but this is
really great as well and I highly
recommend it I know you guys are so
tired hear me talk about this foundation
but I'm wearing it right now just love
this foundation and it's the win while
photo focused foundation I'm actually
using a different primer with it right
now and it still looks so good I worn
this to all of my meetups
and in every photo I love how it looks I
just think it's amazing and it lasts
really well throughout the day I will
say this is not like a 12-hour
foundation is more of like a getting on
right there at 8 hours you know like
when you get to 8 hours you're gonna be
like all right it's time taken salt
really love this so good I go between so
many shades and what I have a mix on my
face right now is golden beige and
desert beige this is the gorge day and
I've just blushing on the website is not
Jordana this is the LA girl just
blushing a blush in the shade just
playful perfect color for everyday just
like a nice mauve pink color and it
really just going everything it's so
pigmented and beautiful it blends out
really well the soft powder it's not
going to emphasize any of your texture
if you just love some sort of wash of
color on your cheeks I think this is the
way to go it is just beautiful can't say
enough good things about it next up I
know you guys are probably so sick and
tired of me talking about this but I
feel like I just always need to tell you
how much I love this palette and then is
my spotlight palette and pearl I'm
wearing it right now I'm wearing all
three shades all over my face it just
gives the most gorgeous glow and I've
been loving things eyes we're at time
meetups and it's just been amazing so
many of you look amazing in the gold and
in the pearl it's just been so much fun
to see everyone wearing it like in
person so thank you so much for picking
these up and supporting my cool
it means so much to me and right now I'm
wearing pearl and is so amazing but if
you are more tan because girl during the
summer time gold will be my go-to next
up is a new bronzer that I tried and I
really really love this I didn't have
any doesn't love it as much as I do
but this is the effect that sunlit
bronzer in the shake pre coast so this
was a palette looks like I did a full
face the first impressions on this which
I don't know when that's going to be up
I don't know if that's gonna be it
before this one or after this video but
I had to mention this because I've been
using it ever since I sold that video
and it is just so beautiful it looks
like such an amazing natural tan but
also has a little bit of glow enos to it
because it does have shimmer in there
but when it's on your skin it doesn't
look shimmering at all like the color is
perfect I thought this was going to be
too light but for me right now it's that
perfect shade to just give me that nice
bronze look to my skin without it
looking orange that look into actually
it's literally that perfect shape
another thing I have been loving is this
Tarte man-eater liner I purchased this
not too long ago and I have been really
loving it I'm always trying to find a
new liner that I love and wearing it
right now it is a brush tip liner which
I'm not normally a stand off but I
really do like this one I'm sure you
swatch is it a 15-2 no I mean that is
intense it's so easy to work with even
though it's a brush tip the only thing I
don't like is if you can see that one
rixel right there I don't know if you'll
be able to see it there's like one
little bristle that's out of place there
it is right there so I don't know I'm
just like closing it wrong or something
but I need to cut that little one off
other than that I think this is great it
lasts all day
it doesn't like run all over my eyes
it's perfect and it is so black and then
the last thing I want to mention for my
favorites are these tarts brushes I love
both of these for contouring and I know
that might be a little strange because
they're both different when one is not
in my sight the other one is and I
usually use one or the other so I don't
have like a specific reason why I love
one over the other but this one I have
to say is kind of taking the cake
recently because I love that this can
contour my nose so easily just because
it does have that nice sharp edge to it
so what I'll do is I'll dip it into my
bra
and I will just very lightly go down my
nose right on that edge and it blends it
out so well increase a nice straight
line also I want to say when target
first came out with these I was like oh
god they probably come out with like
some cheap E for some reason with all of
the brushes I've ever experienced that
are colored like this they've always
been very cheap and not easy to blend
anything and they're not they just don't
feel good on the skin they feel very
scratchy that is not these they are so
soft and amazing don't let the dyes for
you because these are amazing at
blending anything on your face applying
whatever you want I mean you can apply
blush with this one if you wanted to to
get a nicer size application and I love
the handles I just think these are so
fun but the quality is there as well as
the quality went in there I would let
you know but it is so believe it or not
that is all the favorites that I have
for this month it wasn't too much just
because I've been traveling a lot so
I've been putting the same things in my
makeup bag to take with me so those are
the things that I am just absolutely in
love with but now we're going to get to
the Misses so the first one is something
I was going to do a full video on
because I bought the full collection but
I just
I've been trying it out for a few months
and I don't like the formula at all
it's the Jordana sweet cream matte
liquid lip colors these are just way too
dried going in all my lines and that
really doesn't happen very often with
with the lips on me after a while
they're just not comfortable to wear and
they start cracking in the inner part of
my lip and they're just not my favorite
I prefer the wet wild ones I think those
are so much better the catsuit liquid
lips those are five stars in my opinion
sneeze I definitely regret buying
because I bought the whole frickin
collection and formulas just not there
for me next up the reason why I don't
like this product is strictly because of
the color I mean it does lend out really
well and everything but this color is
awful this is the models on scopes and
glow matte bronzing powder and light tan
oh one this is just orange I have a full
video of me testing this out I mean
there's no denying how Orange this
bronzer is it's just too much for me I
can't make it work the formula is really
great but it's just God it is orange I
cannot I cannot put this on my face I
would never contour with this either so
I always say pass on this if you're in
the market for a new bronzer
because the Neutrogena one is so much
better it's been 37 kissed it is just so
much better than this and then the last
thing I have is this contouring palette
from Bronx colors again I did just do a
video on this brand and testing them out
this was probably the worst drugstore
brand I've tried in a while just because
nothing worked out for me for some
reason let me know if you've tried
anything from them that you love down
below in the comments I mean there were
a couple of good items but as a whole it
just wasn't working for me and this
contouring palette I just I can't I
can't work with it the only thing I do
like in this palette is the blush but I
don't want to buy this whole palette for
of one blush I don't like the highlight
palettes in this I mean this could work
as really nice eyes shadows if you
wanted but this is too warm to contour
with this was just way too dark for me
to contour with
I don't really like this shade right
here for any sort of highlighting on my
face and this is just to start white of
a powder and just would not look good
with my colors all in all this palette
just didn't work out for me and the
packaging is just not there for me very
cheap quality and a pretty shirts with
over $10 which is kind of surprising so
now I can get on the music favorites for
you guys and listening to the same stuff
over and over and over again but I have
been listening to a lot more Maren
Morris if you follow me on snapchat you
know I've been listening to her non-stop
because she's always in the background
of my snapchats and I just adore her
though the first song is called company
you keep again this is by Maren Morris
yeah I think that fashion presentation
don't want
did you feel like such a cool girl like
her whole album just I don't know she
seems really dope and this other song is
actually me as a friend it's me as a
friend it's like talking about one of
your friends that has that douchebag
boyfriend that always cheats on her
she's like oh it's fine it's okay he
apologized the Jewish life for life
this is that song is so good it's called
drunk girls don't cry do with trash
thank you why you then hang around girl
you gotta know when to clean house oh
shit yeah also the loving blim by Drake
I should walk dirt see how good I feel I
might just a a - don't show me I got big
head I need to stop running back and
exiting so that is all the favorites
that I have for you guys today I hope
you enjoyed this video definitely let me
know down below what your favorite song
is they would make up product anything
like that I would love to hear it thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you all in my next video bye
