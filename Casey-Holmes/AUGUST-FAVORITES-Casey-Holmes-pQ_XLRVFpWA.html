meet my August favorites and I don't
have a ton of stuff to show you but I do
have quite a few products I've really
been loving this month that I've taken
with me while traveling because I
haven't been traveling a lot so I
haven't played with a ton of new
products in the month of August and in
the beginning here in September so yeah
I have a few random things that's the
makeup favorites and of course you got
to have the music favourites so let's
just go ahead and get started okay so
the first favorite I want to talk about
actually just happened last night Monday
night September 7th and I hit 1 million
subscribers and I just want to say thank
you guys so much it is insane to me like
once I woke up this morning I saw all
the tweets coming in and I was like oh
like oh my gosh it was so crazy they
thank you so much for the love all the
tweets I see all of them the comments
everything and you know thank you just
for watching my videos and taking the
time to subscribe I really do appreciate
it if you're not subscribed I always
have a link in the description box or if
you're on a computer I'll be floating
right here for you guys and you could
just click on it there but thank you so
much all it does is just notify you when
I have a video yeah thank you guys so
much that's the first and foremost the
thing that I wanted to share with you
and just thank you for because it made
my day just so wonderful
ok so one of the random favorites I want
to talk about is candles I have switched
to fall candles into fall wall flowers
it might be a little early but I find
September to be the month of fall like
it's just time to get it going September
first switch everything out and let's
move it on to fall this table is so good
I've been burning it so much whenever
I'm home it is these Tudor on cedar wood
and it's of course from Bath and Body
Works and I said this is a blend of
aromatic cedar wood I hope aromatics the
records that we'll find out and Sony's
cetrone hit with a hint of mint is
carefree and sunkissed is the hill oh
that was horrible
for everyone this blend of aromatic
cedar wood and sunny Citroen with a hint
of mint is carefree and sunkissed as the
hills of California wine country to me
it kind of smells like a guy like a
guy's cologne and it just smells
I really enjoyed this so much and I
purchased a backup today oh by the way I
am so sorry if my self tan just looks
crazy
it probably does I'm actually
self-tanning right now I just applied it
before I started applying my makeup and
I just haven't had time to self tan so
usually before I sell this when I self
tan so that's another favorite is my
loving tan self-tanner I'm obsessed with
it right now I'm wearing the 8 hour one
so it takes 8 hours to develop but
usually I'll do like the 2 hour if I'm
in a rush but I love it so much it's all
I've been using for I don't even know
how long now I know before spring I mean
using it for so long so if you want to
check it out I'll leave a link below and
I have a coupon code as well but I just
wanted to say I know myself my tans look
a little dark it'll look good once it's
8 hours and I wash it off but this is
kind of random to talk about but I
really want to talk about it because I
know I'm not the only home girl that
struggles with Bo sometimes and this is
a secret clinical strength clear gel in
the lavender scent I've been using the
la lavender scent for years ever since I
was in high school I remember raising my
hand and I would smell my armpit because
I love the smell of this ooh la lavender
but I went from gel to like a stick form
deodorant and I just noticed for a
couple weeks I was like man like my vo
is just not good why is this not
combating it but I went back to gel in
the secret clinical straight line and I
really really love it I don't have any
issues using this and it lasts for such
a long time when I'm sweating I'm a
sweaty person I sweat a hell of a lot if
I'm hot which is another reason why I
don't like being hot but I sweat a lot
and if you have kind of some issues with
Bo or whatever if you just not smell in
the way you want to smell I would
definitely check this out because I
really like it and it has worked wonders
for me bo is a real estate people moving
on I went to a ring weekend for my
boyfriend if you watched my last video
you know about it but I took these flats
because we were going to do some walking
and I love them I love the fact that
these fold like this because it makes it
so easy and compact in a dozen
look like you're carrying crazy shoes
around and I love the just the quality
of these is really really nice and I
love the bottoms of them really like
these I just wanted to kind of shout it
out because these were a lifesaver that
weekend because I was walking my butt
off and I had my really tall like
Louboutins
if you ever walked in a pair of
Louboutins or you owned a pair you know
that they are painful and then you
question to yourself why the hell you
said number 21 pair of shoes but yeah
they're painful and these just saved my
poor feets life so these are awesome and
great for traveling because you can just
fold them up isn't it awesome
moving on to makeup favorites this is
something that I did a tutorial on and I
loved the way that it came out so I will
leave that down below if you want to
check it out but there's been so much
drama with this palette I don't even
know but I really like the palette I
don't know what's going on with it
but this is a 3 500 palette I did call
it 3/5 zero in my video it isn't 3/5
Oh as an Oreo and I really love this
palette I took it with me every time I
traveled and it's just my kind of
palette I love the warm tones I love the
oranges the shimmery colors there's a
ton of mattes in here and it's just
beautiful so if you can get your hands
on this get your hands on it it is
absolutely amazing like I said I don't
know what's going on with the orders of
all that and don't really keep up with
morphe that much anymore
I feel like to have just a lot going on
that I don't keep up with brands I just
know they posted one of my photos and
people were going hail in the comments
about how they were upset they couldn't
get it so I'm so sorry about that I had
no idea it had like completely sold out
because I just posted it to post it but
yeah if you can get your hands on it
definitely get it it is a really awesome
palette okay the next thing I want to
talk about is this highlighter it is
from Laura Mercier and is an
indiscretion I knew I was gonna love
this highlighter the moment I opened
this package up I believe I got a
Sephora haul in the beginning of August
or maybe the mid middle of August Erina
I'll leave it down below but I love this
I knew I was going to love it just
because look at it it's so pretty I
don't have it on today but this is what
it looks like right here it's just a
beautiful like sham
Payne color and it gives the most
gorgeous glow you see that oh my gosh so
pretty you guys I really really love it
I don't know if this was like limited
edition or whatever but I found one on
Sephora and I saw it on Sephora for like
so long because it took me forever to
purchased it but yes definitely get it
if you can get your hands on it
beautiful okay so the next thing before
my favorites is this palette from makeup
forever I know a few other youtubers got
one of these made for them it was just a
surprise thing that makeup for ever sent
out I was not expecting it and I opened
the path I opened the package and I was
like what is so cool
trust me I'm never getting rid of this
but it is a makeup forever little
palette like this and they put some
makeup looks on it and these are
actually some of my favorite makeup
looks that I've done so I thought that
was so nice to wear makeup palettes this
is the torched Charlotte palette I have
done a tutorial with this one and also
the next palette I'm going to show you
guys but I love this it is very very
pigmented
I love the purples it's a very wearable
palette you can do something really deep
and dark or you can do a very light look
with it so that's what it looks like
again if you want to see a tutorial with
it I will leave it down below it was a
dramatic look I'm a very dramatic makeup
kind of person I just love dramatic
looks so yeah if you guys wanna see
lighter looks than anything let me know
and then they actually used this one
today for this really kind of vampy fall
makeup look because I was really feeling
fall vibes I just I just love fall so
this is the honest dasya Beverly Hills
world traveler palette shadow couture I
don't know I can't figure out what the
name is but I'm sure it's world traveler
palette but this is what it looks like
all of these shadows are very very
pigmented very beautiful I have this one
on my lid now I mean can you beat that
probably not and then you have this
gorgeous blue and of course my favorite
shade right here which I believe is
called Morocco yes
I mean how pretty are these colors
they're just very pigmented and super
easy to blend out so I'll leave the
other video that I did a tutorial with
this down below and if you guys want a
tutorial on this look let me know in the
comments okay and then the last thing it
makeup wise I want to mention is NARS
all that powder
go in there is this NARS blush and madly
I've talked about this for a really long
time now it doesn't look like anything
special but on your cheeks it just gives
a nice warm flush to the skin like even
swatching it doesn't do any justice
so NARS madly is a staple I even have a
backup because it's amazing another
favorite I want to talk about is my vlog
channel I have been vlogging more on my
vlog channel if you have not seen it I
will leave a link it down below
I actually just posted one last night as

best part

response to Meek Mill and I'm just I'm a
Drake fan so you know I'm on Team Drake
