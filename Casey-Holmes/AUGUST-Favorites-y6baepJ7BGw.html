eat my monthly favorites and we were
doing August now so we're in September
is today September first I have no idea
but I have a bunch of different
favorites I have of course makeup and
they also have some miscellaneous stuff
and some hair items so we're going to
get into it because I feel like it's
gonna be a long video I hope you don't
mind I want to first talk about how much
i am in bralette heaven right now these
have been my Savior like I cannot be
without these so these are by the toys
secret I believe there's a pink line yes
and these are the underwire bra let's
now for me having bigger boobs I want
them to stay in place but I still wanted
like a cute bra let every ball that I
tried it was like my boobs just like
wouldn't stay in place and like they
want to just party and have a good time
and I'm like no stay in place be good
girls and don't go anywhere so that's
why I love this because it does have the
underwear and I think it has a little
bit of push up as well but I love these
I love these for like shirts when I'm
going out if you can still see my bra I
wear this and it's just like a really
pretty lace detail or I'll even wear I'm
under like see-through shirts and it
just looks gorgeous it doesn't look like
you're wearing a bra it looks like
you're wearing a really pretty bra let
so this is the black one I actually have
every single color and I have multiples
of the black and nude just because I
wear them that much and I wear size
large and I'm a 34 double D 36 D it just
kind of depends so yeah I love these
highly recommend them if you're looking
for a really nice bra and you have more
of a bigger chest because they're
amazing that was the black one and then
I also have like this multicolor one I
haven't been able to wear this one yet
because I've mostly been wearing the
nude and the black one and the white one
the next kind of random favorite is two
candles from Bath and Body Works these
have been my all-time favorite I've gone
through about three of these this is a
backup one I have and then I've gone
through probably about two of these this
one is the endless weekend scent and
it's a blend of fresh summer Mandarin
Sunkist Magnolia and blue coconut water
that evokes days of sunshine and
happiness blah blah blah oh it smells so
freakin good and then this one's my
all-time favorite it's done
Beach and it says the sweet fragrance of
easygoing days at the beach filled with
fruit pop sugar cane and sun rays I
don't think that gives you like a really
good description of how it smells but Oh
both of these just smell absolutely
delicious when these are burning in my
house I get tons of compliments these
two the lilac candle and the honeysuckle
candles are my favorite those are just
the ones that I burned constantly
especially lilac I was sucker for a
lilac and honeysuckle so more than
likely that's what my house smells like
because I just loved them but those two
if you can still get them oh they're so
amazing for the quick upper body I'm
going to talk about this cool coconut
surf shower gel from Bath and Body Works
this smells absolutely delicious I know
we're kind of easing out a summer right
now but I personally love coconut scents
throughout the year so I bought a backup
of this I got this this month and I used
it all this month so I love it I highly
recommend it if you can pick this in it
it smells so good okay for shampoo I've
been using a biologic product actually
used up a different shampoo that I
showed in my make up with me video that
one's already gone so onto this one and
this is the bloom of a loom no it's a
volume bloom shampoo for fine hair which
I do have fine hair I just have like
really thick hair but it's fine
so I love the smell of biologic products
I always get compliments whenever I
shampoo my hair with these things
because they just smell so amazing and
speaking of biologic this has made my
hair the most softest shiniest it's ever
been like it's so good it's the
biologics Hydra source daily leave and
tonic for dry hair this is perfect I
don't use this every single day because
like I said I don't wash my hair every
single day but I do blow-dry it this
makes my hair so soft and shiny and just
beautiful like I love this I can tell a
huge difference with this product so
this is what it looks like I believe you
can get it as the lawn and again it does
have that biological and it's just it's
perfect if there's one thing I'm telling
you if you have dry hair that you need
it is this product it is so good I use
this whenever I get out
before I blow-dry my hair I just spray
it all throughout and it just oh it
makes it so soft and shiny really
quickly for skin care about mid way
through the month my skin got so dry
like I've never had dry patches like I
had in the middle middle of this month
and what really helped me was this
Clarence one-step gentle exfoliating
cleanser I've actually been using this
for a while now it's not something I use
every day but I use it you know pretty
frequently and I noticed whenever I have
really dry patches I would use this and
it would just take off the dead skin but
yet leave my skin really nice and smooth
it didn't feel like it was dried out or
anything and I've been loving it I think
it's great for my rosacea because it
hasn't been making it flame up or
anything like that so I love this so
much if you have problematic skin I
would definitely recommend checking this
out because it's not a harsh exfoliator
whatsoever it's really nice and gentle
but it still gets all of that dead skin
off I definitely put this to the test
this month that with the dry patches I
was having and before that I didn't know
if I was actually going to be
repurchasing this but after all that I
am definitely repurchasing it okay
moving on to makeup the first thing I
have to talk about is by far my favorite
makeup item of the month and it is my
new found love foundation if that makes
sense
if the ex1 invisi wears liquid
foundation I have the shakes 300 and 400
which I mixed to get my perfect shade
just depending on how self tan I am is
you know how much 400 I'll put in there
but you can see at the bottom how much
I'm use of it because it does go up
excuse my nail I'm still recovering from
you know when Daisy ripped my nail off
I'm wearing it right now it looks like
skin and it's just so beautiful I cannot
say enough good things about it I've got
nothing but compliments when I wear this
and it never looks cakey and you can
build it up or just leave it a little
bit sheer I love it with a Beauty
Blender I love it with a brush I have
nothing bad to say about it this is a
foundation for all the skin tones if
your about an NC 25 NC 45 you would want
to try this out blast it on me
throughout the nights it doesn't wear
off quickly on me and I don't set my
foundation with powder ever with this
product like I'll put my bronzer stuff
so I mean technically I'm setting it
with powder but I don't take that extra
step of taking a translucent powder and
setting my whole face which is a first
for me you guys also I have I forgot to
mention whenever I had dry patches on my
face that foundation did not cling to my
dry patches whatsoever it literally just
like glided over and made everything
look nice and smooth and I was so
shocked I was just like oh my gosh this
is gonna be a mess but it looked
beautiful so I loved it I think it can
work for dry skin oily skin but for the
time that I felt oily in the month I
used these Chanel matte Limi a
foundation this is a very very matte
foundation so towards the end of the
month I didn't use it as much but in the
beginning I definitely did this is in
the shade 50 and this is great for we're
not as self tanned I would be a little
bit lighter than I am right now
and I love this with a Beauty Blender it
just leaves a really nice flawless matte
finish and I liked it a lot so I
definitely recommend foundation if you
have super oily skin I got mine off of
Nordstrom I believe if I had to choose
between this and Estee Lauder I feel
like that would be a question you guys
asked I would definitely go with Estee
Lauder because I just love Estee Lauder
but this is a great foundation as well
so Estee Lauder didn't work for you
definitely give this one a try and I'm
gonna Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation if I didn't specify next up
is colored minors and I have been loving
loving loving colored eyeliners the
first one is as Laura Mercier Envy liner
this one is just like a really nice
forest green what is up with my dogs
what's going on you're like looking at
that like you're looking at the computer
but there's nothing on there if you guys
tell me it's ghost again grab issues
looks she's such a creep
so colored i layers have definitely been
a big thing for me this month I'll leave
all of my colored liner tutorials that I
did down below I think I did like two or
three and I have just been loving them
so the first one that I used this month
that I loved was this Laura Mercier
cream liner in Envy and this is just a
beautiful forest green perfect for fall
lasted all day on
loved it and then some other ones I used
were by Sigma this one's in the color
unexpected which is just a really nice
gray I did do a tutorial with this one
so I'll leave that below as well as this
one this is by Sigma as well and it's
called standout peacock and then it's a
beautiful blue liner so I love these and
the Sigma ones last a long time as well
really quickly when I mentioned to
eyeshadow palettes that I have been
using non-stop I'm not kidding when I
say non-stop like I don't think I've
used no I haven't used any other
eyeshadow palettes other than these
because they have everything I need like
I could totally get rid of all my
eyeshadow palettes and stick with these
too and be good to go and then as the
lorac Pro and the lorac Pro number 2
this one is the more warm toned and this
is the first one I'm sure you guys have
seen this a ton of times you can always
see what my favorite shades are which is
stable and cream but love this and then
a new found favorite is the Laura Pro 2
which is more on the cool tone side and
it is beautiful both of these palettes
have a row of math and a row of shimmer
and you just need these in your life if
you don't have them you need them I
didn't think I would like this palette
as much Jessica I don't normally like a
lot of cool toned eyeshadows but I can't
keep my hands off of it so these two
have been my go-to eyeshadow palettes
love them love them love them love them
speaking of lorac I'm gonna talk about
my lip color I'll tend even asking my
lip color in my recent post because the
kai-lun tseng the Kylie litter
Kylie litter it kind of looked like the
Kylie Jenner lip trend so the one I was
wearing in all my pictures and in my
last video was this one see Laura Pro
matte lip color in pink taupe I love
this shade that's what it looks like
right there it's exactly what it says
just a nice pink taupe color I love this
on my lips by itself I don't need
anything else
and these map the colors are amazing as
well because they are matte but they
don't dry out your lips so I love them
and then this one it's also called mob I
believe I used this in a tutorial as
well and this is really really that
one's mall and I'll even take
and pink taupe and mix them together to
kind of do my own shade but yeah these
are super creamy really pigmented and I
highly recommend them but beyond to
higher layers really quickly this one
you cannot get it was limited edition I
mean unless you went on Amazon or
something and found it for a super
ridiculous price honestly I would pay
the super ridiculous price for it this
is actually a gift from Amanda a while
back and oh god I love it like love it's
actually an understatement
it's the Estee Lauder pure color heat
wave highlighter and you can see how
much I've used it oh my god is so
beautiful I have it on right now as well
it is just the perfect golden highlight
you cannot go wrong with this one it's
very pigmented gonna last you quite a
while so if you're thinking about
spending the money on it because I know
they're probably going crazy high right
now I say do it because it is amazing
and then the other highlighter that you
must have in your life is this one by
Becca and it's called opal I was talking
about this a while back and I love it as
well again it's just a really nice kind
of golden highlight and that's what it
looks like right there so beautiful on
the skin I love the formula of these
Becca highlighters because they're
really smooth and creamy and they just
blend into the skin really nicely and
give you that fresh dewy glow to your
skin so opals are my favorite I also
love moonstone as well which moon stones
more on the champagne side when this
one's more pendant on the gold side I
want to shout out my favorite bronzer of
the month this is a Laura Mercier mapped
radiance powder in bronze oh - just a
very nice warm tan color looks super
super natural yes so bronze is the skin
at the same time and it's also very
smooth and easy to blend out which is
perfect for bronzer that's definitely
what you need is something that's really
easy to blend down so I will just use
this on the tops of my forehead my
cheeks and a little bit on the neck and
I'm good to go
I've used this quite a bit but there's
still so much to go through like you can
see right there that dome there's so
much to go through with this product but
I
love it it is absolutely beautiful last
product I want to talk about is this Mac
blush this is a mineralized blush in the
color fresh honey I think this is the
one that I got a CCO with Amanda if so
I'm sorry because that means it's
limited edition if you can find it it's
amazing it's called fresh honey and it's
a beautiful orange blush when I was
super sick of like a week or so ago yeah
exactly a week ago I used this blush and
some highlighter on my face and it just
made me look so much more alive and
fresh I don't know something about
Orange I really like it's just one of my
favorite blushes that I own because I
love my oranges you guys know that I've
been using oranges for forever and this
one's like a straight-up orange blush so
if you can find it I highly recommend it
I just love it ok guys so that is it for
