sharing with you my August favorites and
I actually have so many things to share
with you because this month has been the
month for me to try out a bunch of
different makeup products I found quite
a few that I love and I also have a few
misses for you guys in this video but
really quickly I am gonna let you guys
know what is on my face before I get
started and just what I'm wearing so
what is on my lips is this Palladio
velvet matte cream lip color and raw
silks by the way you guys will be seeing
a full tutorial on this so I'm just
going to tell you the lip color this in
my lashes the glitter part on my eye is
the new Urban Decay liquid moon dust
eyeshadows these are so good the color I
have is chemtrail and I'm obsessed with
these already like I love it it was so
easy to apply it look so gorgeous I just
love it and then for lashes I am wearing
the Vegas nay I Lauren grande glamour
these are my favorite lashes from the
drugstore whenever I see them in stock
at Ulta I snag all of them they are such
great drugstore lashes and then I also
have my hair extensions in these are my
foxy luxe extensions and honey spice and
you guys know how much I love my hair
extensions they just helped me feel a
lot more glam you want to see how I put
them in and curl them I will leave my
date night video down below and show you
a full tutorial on how I curled it and
applied the extensions and then for my
choker this is from forever 21 I believe
and then these earrings are from
intermix these earrings are a new
favorite because I'm obsessed of them so
today I'm going to start out with some
skincare now I have completely changed
my skincare regimen and I am in love
with it I'm very hesitant on showing you
guys a skincare routine because
everything I'm using right now is super
high-end very pricy and it's just I
don't want to make the video and then
get a lot of backlash I just I don't
know I have splurged on high-end
skincare lately and I have been loving
the way that it is making my skin look
so if you guys do want to see that just
let me know but I am very on the fence
about it I just don't know if I want to
do it yet but I do want to mention the
daytime moisturizer that I have been
using this is the lemare moisturizing
gel cream and I love this because it
sinks into the skin so quickly this is a
perfect daytime moisturizer if you have
oily skin I would personally go for
something a little bit thicker at night
does it has that gel cream formula it's
just going to sink into the skin
moisturizer so well even if you have
oily skin you should always moisturize
because if you keep dehydrating that
skin more oil is going to produce and
it's just going to be a hot damn mess
and it's not going to look cute so make
sure you always moisturize there are
cheaper alternatives you can check out
some other favorites videos where I
include skincare but this right now is
just so amazing I mean my makeup goes on
so smooth I stay matte for such a long
period of time and then another thing
I've been trying out is this basha Saki
cleansing water it's a no rinse makeup
remover and cleanser I got this in PR
and as you can see I've been using it a
lot I did try to take off all of my
makeup but it was such a pain in the ass
to like put it on the cotton round put
all of my face so I'll just take my
makeup off with a cleansing balm and
then wash my face and everything then at
the very end I got cotton round put some
of this on there and I will just go on
the outer perimeters of my face just to
make sure that I got all of that makeup
off I'm really good at getting the
makeup off here in the center but when
it comes to this outer part it's just
like I forget or I just get lazy and
don't feel like going on way to my
hairline so this goes in and cleans it
up really nicely it is a no rinse
product so you don't have to wash your
face off with this or anything and it
doesn't leave like the oily residue or
anything like that and it does not break
me out so the no rinse part kind of made
me nervous when I first started trying
it but it's actually amazing and it
takes off everything now you can remove
your full face with this I have done
that but it takes a long time so I have
been perfume crazy we're just three new
perfumes this month and these two are
the ones that I am going back and forth
with constantly so the first one is this
new YSL one I forget what it's called
but I will leave it in a bubble in this
video this smells oh my gosh so good I
was in old town I didn't plan on getting
this I went and I smelt it and I was
like let's just see how it smells and I
was addicted from the moment I sniffed
it I'll leave down below with a note
Zarb this just smells so good you guys
in last for a really long time this is
my first favorite and then the other one
is this
bamboo perfume these are two totally
different scents but I am obsessed with
them this one again lasts for such a
long time this is more like a sexy
mature scent like a really nice date
night kind of scent and then this one's
great for like every day this one I
actually posted on snapchat and I was
like I don't know if I like it it smells
a little too mature for me I don't know
but as I wore it I just became more and
more obsessed with it okay let's move on
to some makeup so the first thing I want
to mention is some drugstore products
and the first one is this Physicians
Formula multi colored bronzer I have
been loving this to contour my face it
is what I have right now to contour my
cheeks you need the littlest amount and
it will go such a long way and it blends
so well you can also use these as
eyeshadows if you wanted to if you
wanted to dip a small eyeshadow brush in
there you could totally do that
so it's a great multi-purpose product
but I like to personally swirl them all
together and then use them as a contour
shade like you can't even see it right
there but this is a pigmented sucker
okay
don't let this swatch fool you this
thing is super super pigmented normally
I don't find anything from Physicians
Formula that works for me very well but
this is amazing and it's affordable
again it blends so well it has a little
bit more warmth in it but I like that I
think it looks really natural and just
really beautiful so highly recommend
this and then the other bronzer you guys
have probably seen so many times is this
Neutrogena Healthy Skin blend of natural
bronzer in number 30 this is gorgeous
it's called sunkissed for a reason
because you look like you've been kissed
by the Sun it is awesome it's what I
have like all the tops of my forehead
just to really warm up my face this is I
see I'm getting I'm speechless this is
definitely one of my new favorite
bronzers I didn't know if I was going to
like it at first because it seems super
light but as you can see it just creates
that perfect bronze effect for the face
I did put it on my cheeks and everything
like that and down my neck but you can
really just tell in my forehead because
that's the only product bronzer wise
that I have up there and I just I love
it I get the most beautiful bronze look
from this it's not too warm it's not too
ashy it's that perfect perfect bronzer
call
and I'm obsessed with it so again this
is the Neutrogena Healthy Skin blends
natural radiance bronzer in number 30
blends like a freaking tree next
drugstore product you guys are probably
not gonna be surprised that I'm
mentioning this I compared this to a
super hello I compared this to a hundred
dollar powder and said that I like this
better am i expensive as luxury makeup
also you guys should check that out I
will leave it down below but it is the
flower beauty loose powder in the shade
l01
this is perfect it has that kind of
peachy tone to it so when I set my under
eyes with it in the rest of my face it
doesn't look too highlighted it does
look lighter but just not as intense as
like a regular light translucent powder
in my opinion this is the best thing to
bake with it just looks absolutely
stunning on the skin and it blends away
so well it just looks like it melts into
the skin and it's just stunning like I
literally have nothing bad to say about
this I tried this out in my testing new
drugstore makeup which I'll also leave
down below for you guys if you want to
check it out and I didn't have that high
hopes for it at first but once I use it
in that video I was like I'm done this
is amazing this is going to be my new
favorite gonna be hard to find a powder
that tops this bad boy and the price
because it is such an affordable powder
so obsessed with it if you're looking
for a new translucent powder this is the
way to go next I have this wet wild
boozy brunch highlighter it's what I
have on my cheeks now and also
underneath my brow bone this thing is so
good I pray that this is permanent so
all of you can get your hands on it it
took me forever to find this I believe I
got this at Walgreens or CVS I can't
remember but I went on a manhunt for it
and I finally found it and this is the
most beautiful golden highlighter oh
this is the best highlighter from the
drugstore by far
and nobody beaten this highlighter from
the drugstore look at how pretty that is
I hope this is permanent you guys
because it is beautiful super pigmented
blends out very well
highly recommended so again this is the
wet and wild boozy brunch last drugstore
item is a brush this is the elf flawless
face brush but I have been using this
for blush and I've been using it with
this Fionna Styles soft cheek bill in
Maiden Lane and this is another favorite
I love it it is such a hot pink but if
you use a really light hand with
it is so stunning and it blends out
beautifully I'm just so in love with
this color and usually I don't go for
hot pinks so that's how I know this
thing is good it is just so pretty I
have it on now you would never guess I
had a super hot pink blush that's
because I went in with a light hand I
just wanted to touch of rosiness and
that's what I got with this product and
I love applying it with this elf
flawless face brush because it applies
it directly on that cheekbone and just
blends it out so well now one thing is
this is a really nice brush it has a lot
of bristles and it does pick up a lot of
product so if you're going in with
something like this as super pigmented I
would just tap it a couple times chop
off the excess and then apply it to your
cheeks and I like to apply it by smiling
and then just patting it on my face and
then blending just a little bit I use
the lightest hand with this brush
haven't tried it for anything else other
than blush but I think this is like five
bucks three to five dollars and it's so
worth it it's a great brush up really
quickly I'm going to shout out my other
favorite blush which is the Tarte risque
this is so good it's a great neutral
blush it goes with every single look
it's just that nice kind of muggy nude
color I love it these Tarte Amazonian
clay blushes are amazing they last for
such a long time they blend so well
they're pricey but they're pricey for a
reason and it's because they are amazing
so risque has been my favorite you guys
have seen in almost every tutorial that
I have posted this month because it's
just it just goes with everything and
it's just been sitting over here with my
new makeup and like I haven't really
bought a lot of blushes lately so this
has just been sitting here and every
time I need a blush I reach for it and I
love it
so Tarte risk' is also one of my new
favorite I also want to shout out the
combination I'm wearing for foundation
today I have been loving the Smashbox
Studios skin foundation I have mentioned
this before in a favorites video I think
a couple months ago or maybe last month
I can't remember but I've been loving
this it looks like skin it's just so
beautiful but then if you pair these
Smashbox Studios skin 24-hour waterproof
concealer on top it is like a
bulletproof foundation concealer combo
they're like made for each other you
know what I'm saying it's so amazing I
mean they basically are because they're
both the studio skin line but they are
so good I'm obsessed with this concealer
I knew I
this one this is a concealer I've been
trying out this month that is new and I
love it it never looks cakey and it
never looks like you have a buttload of
concealer underneath your eyes it blends
so well it does not sing it to my fine
lines or anything like that and it lasts
all day long now for that 24-hour claim
I don't know I don't wear my makeup for
24 hours but it does last a long period
of time
I even wore it with the Anastasio stick
foundation and I wore this for 11 hours
this was on top of it and they both
looked amazing this is also a favorite
but I didn't include it in this video
because I just started using it like a
couple days ago so yes it's a favorite
you guys know if you watched my video
I'll leave it down below if you haven't
checked it out but I wanted to wait to
mention it wearing it right now as my
foundation concealer combo and I'm just
in love with them so Smashbox Studios
skin line is a freaking plus so moving
on to the highlighter palette that I
have been using a ton this month if I
haven't been using the wet long
highlighter I have been using this
palette and then as a makeup geek and
kathleenlights collab this is such a
beautiful highlighter palette and pretty
much everyone can use it there is a
shade for everyone I have seen this on
more fair skin and it looks absolutely
stunning as well as this one and this
shade looks gorgeous on deeper skin
tones or you can use this as a blush
topper if you wanted to it's that nice
bronzy shimmery color though with this
one if I had like a really nice bronzed
look going on I would just apply bronzer
to the cheek and then I put just a
little bit of this on top and not
contour and not highlight because it'd
be just a really gorgeous glowy bronzed
look but I'm obsessed with this palette
the shade that I've been going to the
most though is this gold shade the
formula of these is amazing they are so
creamy
they blend out very very well I've been
putting this palette in my makeup bag
because I just love it you can use it
for eyeshadow anything like that I
highly recommend it I will leave a link
down below if you guys want to check it
out this is an awesome highlighter
palette especially if you're a makeup
artist or something this would be
amazing to have in your kit also let's
talk about another collab with a
youtuber which is amazing I love it when
people collab with youtubers because
it's just I don't know like we're
youtubers you know what I mean it's just
so cool to see a brand collab with
someone and support the YouTube
community so this is the two
the power of makeup by nikkietutorials I
love this palette now the shades that I
have used the most are the matte shades
but I've also dipped into this mystic
hour shade and I love it it is so
intense
creamy pigmented beautiful look at that
so pretty everything blends out really
well because it's Too Faced eye shadows
Too Faced usually has really bomb
eyeshadow I've been using ivy painkiller
makeup and chill and wanted a ton I've
also been using champagne truffle
obsessed with that but this is a great
palette to have like as your staple
palette because she made sure she put in
like a highlight shade a transition
shade and then some fun colors in there
that are shimmery and then deeper shades
to you know smoke it out so this is an
all-around great palette even if you
don't use a lot of color you could use
all these other shades every single day
and then you could dip into the colored
ones like for a night out or for a date
night it was just a great palette so I'm
obsessed with this congratulations to
Nicky and Kathleen on their collabs
they're both beautiful
okay another high-end product you guys
know seeing this in action I mean you
can't deny that this is amazing this is
the luxury cellular treatment foundation
it's the powder foundation in the shade
natural beige I have almost all the
shades of this because I'm like
fluctuating with my color because I'll
go to the lake a little bit tan and then
throughout the week I start getting pale
and so I have literally all the colors
that's how obsessed I am with this I
have one in my purse and I have two
right here beside me and I have another
one floating around somewhere and I just
love ok powder puff and I just love this
so much it is the best powder foundation
ever it covers everything it doesn't
look a really drying or anything like
that and it's so comfortable I have two
videos with it I'll leave them down
below I know I'm leaving a lot of videos
down below for you guys but these have
all been put to use you can see them in
videos you can see them going in action
this see them great like if I'm wearing
sunglasses and my makeup starts to come
off on my nose I used to keep concealer
in my purse and I would touch-up that
way but this is so much easier because I
just take my finger in the powder and I
tap it on those areas and then I'm good
to go I don't have to worry about
putting concealer on and then adding
a translucent powder I can just do this
it's like a one-and-done thing you know
what I'm saying so amazing full-coverage
doesn't accentuate your pores and it
doesn't look dry so loved this so much I
also have an Ulta haul coming for you
guys I did purchase two other powder
foundations I am on the hunt for a dupe
for that I feel like it's gonna be
really hard but I am on the hunt or just
a cheaper alternative in general so keep
a lookout for that Ulta haul you'll see
the ones that I have coming for you I'm
excited for you to see it okay now for a
liquid lipstick I have been trying out
these lorac Pro liquid lipsticks I
believe these come out September 19th
these are awesome now I will say I do
love these Smashbox formula better I
think the Smashbox formula wears a lot
better throughout the day they're a
little bit more comfortable they're not
drying whatsoever but I do really like
these the only thing is that this is
just a little bit more drying than the
Smashbox ones but it's not something
that I can't handle when using the shade
nude rose and then I'm using a mom one I
forget what it's called but I will leave
it down below I just love it so much it
smells so good they're super pigmented
and I mean it's just so fun to play with
a new liquid lipsticks so this has been
one of my new favorites they last for a
super a long time
they're amazing I've been keeping this
one in my purse actually had to go down
and get it before I filmed this video
two more favorites really quickly are
these two brushes I've been loving the
artiste linear three this one for
contouring my nose I just put some
bronzer right here
then blend it out with a duo fiber brush
it's been amazing I love it love this
way more than my traditional blending
brush that I was using I have a lot more
control and it really makes my nose
look skinny which I enjoy and then also
this Too Faced bronzer brush I talked
more about this in that luxury makeup
haul and explain to you I really love it
but it's amazing it's just such a soft
brush and I love applying bronzer with
it blends everything so well okay so
let's go ahead and get onto the misses
the first thing I have is this Dior pore
minimizing skin refining matte primer
this does make your pores look smaller
but I do not like the texture of it the
texture is very how do I explain
it's kind of like a moosie creamy gel
type formula I don't know here we'll
just squirt it out on the back of my
hand it looks like that and you feel it
and it feels really good it kind of is
like silicone gel feel to it but what I
do not like about it is just the way
that it lays on my skin and I guess just
because I get super oily when I start
getting oils coming through my
foundation this makes it ten times worse
it makes it feel heavy it makes it feel
gross and slimy I just do not like it
and you know after about an hour I'm
like oh hell no I want to take this all
off and I know it's this primer because
I used it with the foundation that I
love and I did not like that foundation
when I wore it with this primer so this
is a no-go for me not my favorite if
you're super oily next we have this
anyway makeup academy liquid lipstick I
use this in a video and I absolutely
hated it throughout the day
gorgeous colors but the formula is so
gross and dry and it really accentuates
chapped lips so not my favorite
unfortunately from the drugstore I had
high hopes for them but this brand does
have other things that are really great
just the liquid lipsticks and the
formula were not my cup of tea so have
to pass on this one I feel super bad
mentioning this but it's just not my
favorite liquid lipstick it's the Hoonah
Beauty liquid matte lipstick and this is
a shade Spice Girl the other one that I
tried the more nude shade was great
stayed on really well but this one just
wore off so quickly on my lips I don't
know if it was just the color or what
but it was kind of streaky and as I wore
throughout the day it just kind of like
wore off and looked really gross and was
really dry so I'm not a fan of this
color maybe I should try some other
color this one's a really pretty color
it's like a brown topi shade I love the
shade but it was super streaky going on
and I did not like the way that it wore
throughout the day then the last thing
was one that I was like no my worst
nightmare came back to me this hasn't
happened to me in a minute okay this is
the honest hacia dark side waterproof
gel liner now I had high hopes for it
because it said waterproof
it was pigmented okay so this is a liner
right here once you build it up it is a
nice black shape I did one swipe that's
what I got but then I applied a couple
more coats and then I got this color but
on your waterline it actually shows up
really well it's nice and pigmented but
then it happened to where it ran on the
outer corner of my eye and the inner
corner of my eye and nothing irritates
me more then crease eyeshadow and when
your eyeliner runs I know it's terrible
in it so this did that it did it quick
too and I was so disappointed I had such
high hopes for it if you need a good
eyeliner the NYC waterproof eyeliner
it's so creamy so black I love it so
those are all my hits and misses for the
month of August I hope you enjoyed it
and now I'm going to show you guys
