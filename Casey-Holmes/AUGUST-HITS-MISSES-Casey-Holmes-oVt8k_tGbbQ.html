be sharing with you my August hits and
misses I have quite a few hits and I do
have some misses for you as well of
course we've got some song favourites
we're gonna be jammin out haha but we're
gonna talk about the hits first then the
misses and then get onto the songs so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
but don't forget to subscribe before you
leave and if you want to see all my
favorites and not so favorites then
let's just go ahead and get started okay
so moving on to hair I just have one
hair product that I want to mention to
you guys because I really do love this
product it's the way at Memory this is
the way in the marine mist and I love
this more for a heat protectant I don't
notice it holding my style super long or
anything like that because my curls
usually lasts pretty well and I just
haven't seen a difference with it they
still say a little bit tighter or
whatever but I have noticed a difference
with how shiny my hair is and my hair
doesn't feel super dry after curling it
I do apply this right before I curl my
hair with anything no matter if it's
like third day hair or second day hair
or whatever I will put this in and I
like it cuz it's also not heavy and it
adds a little bit of texture to your
hair so I just spray it all over I'll
like lift some ends and do this and then
I brush it through to kind of evenly
distribute it and then I'll curl my hair
and I just love it I think it smells
really good it really protects your hair
it's just a really great product so I
highly recommend checking out this way
memory miss moving on to foundations I
have two okay let me just say so first
off this YSL all hours foundation I
absolutely love this foundation this is
such a gorgeous full coverage finish but
it looks like skin it doesn't accentuate
pores it doesn't accentuate texture and
it lasts so well throughout the day
great light weight full coverage product
I highly recommend this the shade range
does suck and I do recommend going in
store to try to find your shade like
your perfect match because I went
through some shades to get to my tan one
okay I went through some shades a tan
shade is warm honey I will say it
wouldn't match me right now right now I
am a little bit sunburned actually
wearing elf this is called acne fighting
I believe this is the acne fighting
foundation but I'm wearing the shade
sand right now I did like an Instagram
tutorial on this look so you'll see
on my Instagram soon but I'm normally
like this shade or below so I'm gonna
stick with 50 warm honey for like my
just self tan shade like the fact that
it has a pump it is expensive but in my
opinion I think it is so worth it then I
just want to shout out this Estee Lauder
Double Wear I love this shade it which
is in the shade four in one I can get
away with this
right when I sell tan and also when the
self tan is kind of fading away I would
like this a lot this color is just
perfect for me and I will say I told you
guys I wanted to see how both of these
mix together would look and oh my gosh I
love these two together as well I don't
think it's necessary but if you do have
both and you want to mix them I highly
recommend it it just is such a gorgeous
like super full coverage finish I mean
just locked and loaded but Estee Lauder
Double Wear does last longer than the
YSL even though this lasts a long time
on my skin this would last like till the
next morning okay this one wouldn't this
would like stay on my face slept through
the night I have had many nights using
this foundation where I did not take it
off after a long night of going out to
some bars and it was on my face the next
morning still looking full coverage and
amazing I love the longevity of this and
I think these two just mix together are
beautiful sometimes this can be a little
too heavy and not look like skin so when
you mix the white cell with it it just
kind of tones it down a little bit and
it makes it feel more like skin a little
bit more lightweight and not so heavy
and thick yeah it's not like a must-have
you can totally get away with just this
but I think for my wedding day I found
the combo next up I'm going to talk
about the powder that I have been so on
the fence about since I tried it and you
know because you've seen it a whole
month pretty much it's the Too Faced
Born This Way setting powder I have come
to the conclusion I do like this powder
I think it has such a beautiful finish I
don't think it lasts that long on my
skin like it doesn't keep me super matte
for a really long time but it does sit
on the skin really nicely and when I
blot my skin it doesn't look cakey or
anything like that I will say I don't go
back in with this powder to touch-up
because I don't take this with me
anywhere but it does set the makeup
really well it just doesn't keep me
matte for a long period of time one
thing I also don't like is the lid I
think the lid is not necessary someone
said that
cut this off I'm gonna have to try that
out that's just a personal preference
though I don't like the lid but the
actual powder is really nice so for
eyeshadow I have discovered that this
has been my go-to warm palette and the
reason I say that is because I had a few
other palettes in my drawer that I tried
out one day and I was mixing and
matching different shades in each
palette like that Urban Decay Naked heat
and just some other one and then I went
to this palette finally because I was
like oh this palette has everything that
I need so I'm just gonna go into that
one and I love this one more than the
Urban Decay Naked heat palette I don't
dislike the naked heat palette but after
using this along with it like side by
side I like this one a lot more I feel
like it blends a little bit better I
like the color selection better again
this is the Sephora Pro Pro pigment
palette and I don't know I just like it
a lot more I know some people have a
problem with the fallout Fallout was a
big issue this month okay which is a
huge issue but I don't mind it with this
palette because they all blend so well
and then I just find it so easy to work
with and I really enjoy the looks of
that I come up with so love this it has
a really big mirror it is kind of heavy
to travel with but the mirror is nice
and I really like the shades so this
will be going in my travel bag at the
end of this week
also if you didn't see this month I did
do a review on all three of these
palettes so I will link that down below
if you want to check that out and have
swatches and all that kind of stuff
another eye product that I have been
loving is this elf product I did not
expect to like this but I really loved
it I used it last week in New York and
it just lasts so well on my eyes it's
what I have on now I was just really
impressed by this so it's the elf aqua
beauty island breeze so this one's my
ultimate favorite just because I love
these two right here I can't like to
play with this one I feel like it's
gonna be so gorgeous on the eye but
they're really pigmented I love them to
kind of give that wet look to the eye
which is what I did today
I put down this like yellow-green first
and then put this on top just to kind of
make it look really shiny and sort of
wet to kind of go with the highlight and
I really like it I used it last week
with just this on my lid and it looked
so beautiful and it was so easy to
create the look I just did a transition
shade and then a little bit of a deeper
shade
right below that this all over the lid
and I was done I put on some false
lashes and I was out that's really well
on my oily eyelids highly recommend a
primer with this product yeah again this
is in the shade Island breeze and it's
the elf aqua Beauty palette I think we
all know I've been trying a lot of brow
products you've probably seen it in a
lot of my videos and my hauls and like
first impressions and things and I have
found that these two are my favorite
just because I can kind of customize my
eyebrow now I'm still working on this
inner part right here I am NOT a pro at
brows okay I've never claimed to be a
pro at brows I'm a lot better at pomades
than I am
pencils but I feel like I'm getting
better as I keep going on I'm trying to
just really figure out how to get those
feather-like strokes in here it's really
hard for me I have a really hard time
doing the feather technique even though
I haven't perfected that technique I
still like the way my brows look and
these two are my favorite I love the
goof proof brow pencil this is more of a
thicker brow pencil we'll say I liked it
at first for the shape but as I've used
it the shape has definitely worn down I
mean it's still there but it's just not
as precise so then that's when I go on
with this precisely my brow makes total
sense and it's a smaller pencil as you
can see and I'll just go in here to the
inner part and kind of line out the
brows underneath and above just wherever
I need more precise color application
and then I love that both of them have
spoolie is on the end I always need a
spoolie and yeah I'm in the shade number
two and I just find that these would be
my go-to brow products I've been really
enjoying them I did a Sephora try on
haul I think it was like a couple videos
ago and I really was impressed when I
was first using this and I'm back on it
I still really love these I've been
using them non-stop
that video was pre filmed so don't worry
I've been using those for longer than
two days but also favorite mascara of
the month is hands-down this essence
volume stylist lash extension mascara oh
my gosh I have been wearing this so much
if I'm not wearing false lashes but I'm
wearing a mascara this month is probably
been at this mascara because I love it
it just gives you so much volume what I
love the most about this is it adds a
lot of volume at the base of your lashes
and then really builds it up to the tip
of your lash
it just looks so full and fluttery and
it looks like false lashes so I've been
really enjoying this on days that I
don't want to wear falsies you like full
bold natural lashes I think you would
really like this mascara and it's only a
few dollars I mean it's good stuff y'all
it's good stuff and it lasts all day
long
moving on to bronzer - the thing that
surprised me the most this month it is
the Saint Tropez sculpt bronze and
highlight powder and it has a really big
mirror and these are the shades right
here I wasn't sure about these because
they all have a little bit of shimmer in
there but when you blend them all
together just creates this beautiful
warm bronzy tan color like it is the
perfect tan color for your face to make
you look like you just came back from
the beach or something I also love the
packaging of it how big the mirror is
and I just think the colors are perfect
I can also contour with this one as well
I did that in a previous video the
Sephora Tryon again that was pre filmed
so I have been using this longer than
two days it's not like a matte give me
Sun kind of warm it's just a nice
natural warm tan color like it's just
perfect so I highly recommend this for
my girls out there who love to be
bronzed year-round like myself this is
perfect for you and then the contour I
have been using one of the Make Up For
Ever little pans let's see what you're
called this is in the shade s11 6 from
Make Up For Ever and I love this to
contour it is the perfect ashy tone for
me it doesn't look muddy it doesn't look
like I have a gray cast or anything like
that it just looks like nice sculpted
cheeks I love the size of this this did
come in PR and I just put this shade in
this one little tin guy and I love it I
think it was so nice it blends out
really well and again it just creates
that a nice shadow underneath the
cheekbone last things we have our lip
products so the first one is another mac
lipglass and this is in the shade myth I
am NOT a fan of the lipstick myth I feel
like it's way too nude for me I just
can't work with it but this is a really
pretty color it's not too light of a
nude it's just kind of like a perfect
peachy nude and it's great to layer over
lipsticks it's great to put in the
center of the lips to really make them
look a little bit more plump let's see
if I can put it on right now I already
have a gloss on but you see that color
it's nothing too intense and this is
like it's just a lip glass it is more
sheer but it does have some color there
but it's a really beautiful color to
just kind of ombre your lips out and add
some more dimension to your lip color
and I really like it I have been loving
this next up is what I had on before I
put miss on and it is the huda beauty
lip strobe in the shade angelic I think
this is gorgeous gorgeous this is
beautiful by itself it's beautiful on
top of lip colors it's just everything I
want and more so that's what it looks
like right there sometimes it's lilac
sometimes it's more of that champagne
peach color it's just gorgeous
I really love it by itself too when I
did my products I regret buying or
something whatever that video was called
I'll leave it down below I wore this on
my lip so many of you were commenting
like what is on your lips what is on
your lips to the point where I had to
pin it in the comment to be like this is
it so you guys could go and check it out
but I love this color and to me I feel
like this lip color can go with any look
and I don't have anything like this this
is so unique in my collection I just
think it's stunning and then the next
thing that I for sure thought was
overhyped over-hyped is this Pat McGrath
lipstick this is in the shade 1995 this
is another lip color that you guys have
been dying over this month on my
Instagram just been loving it it is so
pigmented it's that perfect like rosy
nude color
I find this lipstick so interesting so I
wore it on the first day I ever wore
this I put it on and I was like mm okay
it's alright you know it's just a
regular lipstick like I don't know what
everybody's freaking out about but once
it dries it really goes down to that
gorgeous matte finish and it's not gonna
budge like it lasted all day on me and I
was so shocked I was like there is no
way this is a lipstick like what once I
saw how this formula worked with my own
two eyes and I felt it for myself I was
like okay this is why you're so hyped up
it's a matte lipstick but it's a
long-lasting matte lipstick like it's
not gonna budge on me mine stayed on all
day through eating and drinking it does
transfer it stays on my lips it's the
craziest thing it's such a different
texture for a lipstick like when it
dries down it's kind of hard to explain
by highly recommend trying them out I
think they're awesome they are expensive
they are constantly sold out I'm telling
you
every time I try to go link this color
for you guys it sold out so I'm not sure
where you can get this other than
Sephora I'm sure she has a website or
something but I definitely recommend
trying them I think it's totally worth
it and this packaging is so unique as
well very luxurious last thing I want to
talk to you guys about are these cover
FX drops I put these on the back burner
for a freaking who knows how long I feel
like I have not touched these in so long
finally I was like okay I have to use
them they were like up on my shelf with
my body products because I don't use
liquid highlighters on my face I did try
to use this one time this month on my
face and I was just not having it I
didn't think it'd look great on me so I
was like okay well I purchase all them
it's time to use them as the body
illuminizer 's and I really do love them
my favorite favorite one to highlight
the body with is moonlight I think it's
that perfect shade I mean I don't know
how long these are gonna stay here well
Fuego is here but I was really enjoying
these this month I am gonna take them
with me traveling and like mix them in
with my moisturizer and stuff so let's
move on to my missus for the month I
only have four items here to share with
you guys the first - I did a video and
these were mentioned in that so if you
watch that video this is not a surprise
but the Sephora make no mistake
foundation and concealer stick this was
in my trying these products one last
time video so when you read that title
just know that's how I'm saying it I
just didn't like this on my skin I felt
like it really emphasized texture it
just wasn't sitting really well when I
got oily throughout the day it would
just not mix at all the oil would sit on
top of the foundation and it just wasn't
my favorite it wasn't a full coverage
product on me as well and there's just
better stick foundations out there like
the hourglass managed stick foundation
that I prefer over this one next up is
the Too Faced melted latex liquefied
high shine lipstick these are so
beautiful the color payoff the shine
everything about them is just stunning
to me I just cannot freakin stand it
when lip products get on my teeth
constantly like I'm so shocked that this
liquid lip with these glosses has not
gotten all over my teeth it did in the
very beginning just a little bit but not
much at all and I haven't had anything
on my teeth which is what I need and lip
products you know I just can't be
checking my teeth every five seconds
and with this I find myself constantly
having to check my teeth and it's always
all over my teeth
I just hmm can't make it work I do use a
lip liner with this and it still kind of
gets outside the lip line as well which
just gets a little too messy for me so
unfortunately these did not work for me
but they are really beautiful if you
love a high shine gloss but you want
like a liquid lipstick form this might
be for you just check your teeth okay
last two products I have is this product
which is the elf poreless face primer
I love elf but this was just a total
miss for me this was I used this product
at the acne fighting foundation that I'm
wearing now and it made it look so bad
it just made it slide all over the place
it looked so oily I was trying to film
an elf one brand tutorial this was the
first face product I used and guys I
quit filming that video I took my makeup
completely off after putting my
foundation powder concealer on top of
this it just made everything slide
nothing wanted to stay in place and it
did not make my pores look smaller so
I'm so sorry elf this was just a Miss
for me and then the last thing is this
Becca light chaser highlighter again
this is featured very recently and I
just don't like the formula of this I
think it really emphasizes texture and I
think the colors are super cool I just
don't feel like it's worth the money in
my opinion it's just not something I
want to spend my money on luckily I did
get these in PR and I give a few of them
away to friends I think these are
definitely for like makeup lovers who
love to step outside the box and really
like try different highlights like you
know there was that holographic
highlight trend going around and things
like that if you're into stuff like that
you might really like these highlighters
if you have texture I would just be
warned that it does emphasize it because
it is more of a thicker formula if that
makes any sense to us it's not like
they're regular highlighters if you're
kind of weary of that I would stay away
from this and if you're not into trying
cool different colors and I would stay
away from these as well just because I
didn't really I don't know I didn't
really enjoy them for like a day-to-day
use I don't really use highlighters to
like step outside the box and like do
purple and pink I don't I like to stick
with my gold champagne
really pretty shade even tried the what
is it champagne flashes gold and the
formula just looked really bad on my
textured skin yeah that is it for my
hits and misses and now we got to get on
to our song favorites and I don't even
know if I have a lot of song favorites
but I'm hoping we do oh I know one that
I could tell you guys and all our you're
gonna be like oh this song again I'm the
last person on this planet this month to
love the song but I love it love that
song I think it is so catchy and when
I'm working out it's just such a good
motivation song another good song to
that I discovered is I get the bag by
gucci mane featuring me goes oh my gosh
I don't know the words so don't quote me
on these but I just love the beat of it
I don't know it's just got a good beat
and it's nice to listen to whenever I'm
working out again I have been really
enjoying country again this month it's
just my thing I'm really into it right
now hahaha this song called my mistake
by cam it's just it's it's good it's
funny I think that you should
it's just a really good song she has a
really good voice I highly recommend
checking her out again her name is cam
next up is okay this is an oldie but a
goodie it's George Strait one night at a
time oh my god you guys
heebie jeebies so good
I also really like singles you up by
Jordan Davis this is again another
country song okay guys so that is it for
my song favorites I really didn't have
that many this month after looking at
them so I'm sorry about that but I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and I will see you all
in my next one bye about to leave
already packing come with me I'm not
really asking we'll get away to a place
