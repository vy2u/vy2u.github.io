all about my hair I get a ton of
questions pretty much every day about my
hair so I wanted to show you guys the
products I use and really quickly go
over you know how I style it like what
my cut is what the color is all of that
so we're gonna go ahead and get started
first off the cut it's just a long
layers really nothing like extravagant
um I just get long layers and then for
my bangs I've always had these bangs I
like to make sure they keep them trimmed
at least below my jawline so um yeah
that's my cut you guys like seriously
it's really nothing special and then for
my color last time I heard it was bleach
so I might be wrong but I might be right
so I do believe it's bleach blonde in my
hair on the ground in my hair is my
natural color and I do get a halo of
highlights full highlights um a lot of
people say that they went and got their
hair highlighted and it's not as like
blonde is mine you have to remember that
mine is over like a three year process
like it took me three years to get this
blonde um I didn't just all of a sudden
go to the hair salon and say hey dye all
of my top like the top part of my head
blonde I didn't that didn't happen so I
do get a halo which if you tell your
stylist she will know what it is um so
yeah all the brown is real and just keep
in mind when I first got my highlights
three years ago mine were so brassy and
I did not have this much in my hair I
had like a few going through um and they
were very very brassy but I kept with it
like I just kept the highlights and just
trying to work with them they ended up
fading you know throughout the weeks and
stuff so I wasn't horrible but you will
probably get some brassiness if you are
a natural brunette and you just all of a
sudden want to go blonde so and I don't
recommend trying to go this blonde on
your first try you might damage your
hair yeah that's pretty much for my
color and cut you know halo bleached
blonde highlights the brown is real cut
very very simple
oh I don't run off because I put a hair
powder in okay so I
gonna talk to you real quick about
shampoos and stuff I use I have been
loving the Dove hair care line the
damage therapy and the nutrient the
nutritive therapy which is this one's
the nourishing oil care this is the
shampoo I've been using a lot lately and
then I showed this in my April favorites
and it's the intensive repair
conditioner so I've really just been
loving the both of these for my hair
lately and I also love the Victoria's
Secret line I think it's the nourishing
line I have to go pick that up whenever
I get a chance to even go into town but
their hair care products are amazing so
I highly highly recommend them and then
one more shampoo for the blonde in my
hair I use is the shimmer like shampoo
the Clairol professional that's what it
looks like you could find this at any
Sally's Beauty Supply and this was eight
twenty nine so I recommend a purple
shampoo if you plan on dying some of
your hair blonde okay next we're just
going to talk about products real quick
the first thing is a heat protectant
I've been going to a lot more than like
my sheet heat protectant this is the got
to be guardian angel 420 degree or 425
degree heat protection this is really
really great stuff it's been working
really great for me so that's that take
it and then the next one is also another
protectant this is a so sexy smooth from
Victoria's Secret straighten styling
miss conditions for heat styling
perfection or protection and frizz free
styles as you can see I am highly highly
low on this gotta go refill but that's
what it looks like I did put the
Tresemme top on it because I like the
way it sprays and I don't know the
Tresemme one did not work for me by the
way the heat tamer but I put it on this
because I just like the way to spray is
better than the one that comes with it I
got a lot of heat protectants another
heat protectant is the John Frieda Frizz
Ease heat defeat protective styling
spray I love when you know I can put
different hue protectants in my hair
before I blow dry my hair and this one's
great for that so this is what that
looks like I've had this for a while I'm
running super duper duper low on it so
I'm gonna have to get another one
by the way excuse everything in
background I know I'm a I'm a mess I
don't know okay and the next day john
frieda for repair perfect and sheer mist
this is a two ounce bottle and it just
ranges from seven to nine dollars
depending on where you get this
so I recommend Walmart if you're looking
at buying this product because it's a
lot cheaper there then CVS or Walgreens
so I recommend checking this out it's
really great I mean you can tell the
difference in your hair like right when
you blow-dry it so I highly recommend
that the next thing and by the way I
don't use all of these at once I do use
the red can and like these so sexy
smooth one everyday and the shampoo
conditioner Bowl all whatever but I
switch up my um you typed it's pretty
often so those are ones I really like
and I love this is the red Kent extreme
anti snap leave-in treatment for
distressed hair I don't know if you guys
have seen this I've heard a couple
people talk about it but this is just
what it looks like really great just to
put on on your hair I like to go for my
ears down I just don't know I like to do
that with my leave-in treatments and
stuff another thing that I actually
don't have I recommend is the macadamia
healing oil I think it's called that
stuff is great I always put a lot in my
hair after I shower and I plan on going
to sleep that night I put ton in and it
just soaks it up and it's just amazing
okay so the next thing I want to mention
is this organics nourishing coconut milk
this is like a great alternative if you
don't want to go and spend the money on
this Redken product this is what that
looks like it's just the nourishing a
coconut milk and it's the anti-breakage
serum which is it's just really really
great leaves my ends really soft and I
just like it a lot um for the strainer I
use I get this a lot as well
it's this to do one-inch flattering this
foot looks like I got it from follicle
calm like a year or so ago after I saw
somebody do review on it so um yep
that's where I got my little Sidhu and
if you guys are ever wondering like if I
do a hair tutorial or like hair stuff
Muslim more than likely everything is
down below or in the video so just make
sure you check it out um another thing
is to volumizing powder
I really love and talk about all the
time I'm the first one I like this one
for kind of like going out hair like if
you want that big serious like hair
it's the got to be powerful some
volumizing powder really great stuff it
does leave your hair super sticky like
this is why you only use it for like
going out because it's some serious
stuff and you do want to you know wash
it out of your hair but it's really
great and it does what it's said so
that's why I really like this product
and then one that's really great for
everyday use is rock your hair bombshell
big hair powder you can get this at
t.j.maxx for like eight or nine dollars
something like that but this is really
really great for just everyday volume if
you don't want too much going on this is
just great to kind of throw in and give
your hair a little bit of volume and
some texture um and then I'm going to
talk about two little brushes first it's
a teasing comb I like it's only whenever
I decided to use my hair it's just the
Conair one I got this at CVS maybe think
it was CVS and then this I also got from
CVS I recommend using a wide tooth comb
if you get a shower and you want to
start brushing your hair or something do
not use a brush don't use one I know
it's really dirty don't you don't use a
brush you need to use a wide tooth comb
so I highly highly highly recommend this
one really great and just great for your
hair so yeah that is everything I wanted
to show you guys I hope I answered a lot
of y'all's questions yes the Q&amp;amp;A video
is coming up I promise I'm so sorry I'm
gonna try to use the videos that it or
the clips that I filmed and read edit
them and see if I can get it up this
time if not I will exactly have to
refill it like tomorrow so yeah I hope
you guys enjoy this and I will see you
all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
