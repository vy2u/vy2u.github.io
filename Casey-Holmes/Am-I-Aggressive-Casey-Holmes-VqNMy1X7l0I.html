a Q&amp;amp;A I haven't done one in a while
because the last time I did one people
were like okay you're doing so many Q&amp;amp;A
hold up let me get some makeup tutorials
so I made sure to give you guys the
makeup tutorials and kind of break it up
but I figured today I would do another
Q&amp;amp;A because I love to days I think
there's so much fun if you haven't seen
my q and A's before I will link them
down below yeah I had to get ready and
film something for Good Morning America
and I was like woah what do I do now
because I need to film so I figured a
Q&amp;amp;A would be fun to do and yeah I hope
you guys enjoy it I asked you on
Instagram on this photo right here I
love that makeup look you haven't seen
this makeup look I did tutorial I'll
link it down below oh my god those
lashes are amazing Megan K Brown ass how
do you stay motivated to work out and
not just go get a burrito at most the
struggle I feel you um I have to say I'm
not very strict on my diet I really
should be but let's be real like if I'm
gonna burrito I'm gonna eat that burrito
that's just how it is
life is too short I try to use as good
as I can throughout the week and make
healthy choices and I feel like burritos
are a better option depending on what
you put in them then say a chicken
sandwich from chick-fil-a cuz it's fried
and all that butter and stuff so I don't
know I I love working out and I think
since I have a trainer I have to go
these four days a week I can't like
stand him up or anything like that and
um I think that has really helped me
like keep going to working out because
sometimes I wake up in the morning and
I'm like oh I don't want to do it but I
know he's there waiting for me and I
have to go so I think me getting a
trainer really helped a lot or if you
just get like a gym buddy and they meet
you every day that would help a lot
generally do you rather be in a
relationship as opposed to being single
um that's a hard question I've only been
in to like serious relationships in my
life and Davis and my ex and BS I say
Davis is serious because I don't see me
and him breaking up ever I love the
relationship I'm in now but I loved
being single as well I had no issue with
being single I didn't even expect to
have a boyfriend at this time it's just
one of those things that as long as you
love yourself and then you love the
person that you're in a relationship
with you're going to love either one so
I can't
to pick one of course right now
obviously I'm so happy where I'm at in
my relationship and I'm so blessed but
when I was single I was happy and
blessed at that time too and I really
had fun so either way just love it
embrace whatever status you're in
because your says honestly doesn't make
you as long as you just love yourself
and you're having fun that is all that
matters
Daisy elder as have you and Davis had
serious conversations about your future
marriage kids I know it's early but when
it's meant to be it's meant to be love
you too
yes I totally agree I think some people
have a really hard time with that
I have always been like when I see
people in relationship for a couple
months and they're like oh my god
obsessed with each other there's some
people that are just doing it to doing
it then there's some people that are
genuinely in love and I've seen that
with my best friends that are actually
getting married next month they haven't
even been together for a year but
they're getting married and that you can
see the love between them too and it
changed the way I looked at it forever
but we'll really also helped me change
the way I looked at that is Davis I
never have ever felt anything like I
have with him it's just so it's
beautiful interesting it's fun it's hard
because it's long distance but when you
know you know and if you if you don't
believe in that you haven't had that
experience yet so you can't judge people
on how they feel no matter how how much
period of time they've been together
it's not your place to judge and if they
are judging you who gives a right
have talked about things like that and
we have you know discuss things you know
funny and then serious he will be an
officer in the army once he graduates
which is next year so it's one of those
things where once he graduates I mean
it's going to get real like what are we
going to do are we going to move
together are we gonna move in what I
mean how is it gonna work you know what
I'm saying it's not a standard
relationship so yes we have talked about
it and I met about it when asked about
ever move away from Georgia if so where
it's obviously a thought in my mind now
that if I have to move like I have to
move but let's be real I love Georgia I
don't know what it is I just love
Georgia I love the south I love the
state I love everything about Georgia
I've never had any issues like I've
never dogged my own state I absolute
you love it - the football team I don't
like Georgia sorry I
if I had to move I would want to go to
like Tennessee or um Kentucky or I mean
I feel like Colorado would be beautiful
so I like that of course if I have to
move it's gonna be so hard on me because
I would have to be leaving my mom and I
do not want to do that
it does gonna be really hard but I feel
like I'm gonna have to do it some boy a
cake a valise sorry I said how old were
you when you moved out and bought a home
was I 1900 0:19 or 21 I got my first
apartment and I was 2001 now I was 23
when I got my house I was in my
apartment for a couple years and then I
decided to move to a house this is my
house nobody has cosign with me and I'm
proud of it this was like the biggest
like adult experience of my life it was
a hard hard situation just a lot of
paperwork it's a lot of stress and I
mean not finding the house but like the
paperwork that comes along with it it's
just crazy and moving but I would not
trade it for anything in the world
Eric to 100 asked how do you know if a
guy really wants a future with you I
think that's something I was very known
you just know if he's scared to talk
about it or if he gets like this weird
face when you start talking about it
then he probably doesn't want a future
with you but if you never talk about it
and you never even if it's not just a
thought in your mind or thought in his
mind it's probably not going to happen
because I feel like it's just one of
those things where you should be excited
to get married and you want this and you
think of the future and if you can't
think of a future and they can't think
of a future with you they probably don't
want it which is totally fine because
you can move on to the next person and
maybe they'll want that future with you
you never know someone asked if Davis
turns up to music as much as I do and by
the way I love you too this was xoxo
Dana
hey well like sometimes we'll have like
little parties in the car and like just
joke around listen to old music like
older pop music or older rock music and
we'll just like jamming out to whatever
his favorite songs are and then what my
favorites are so yes he does he hits
down with the get-down for sure someone
asked how's my relationship with my dad
I have a good relationship with him and
we've been close like we don't have my
type of relationship that I have with a
lot of people
is I talk to them when I can sometimes
it's just not enough and then once you
see each other again you like catch up
on everything that's how I am oh my dad
like we don't speak to each other every
day every week um anything like that
which I probably should more like
sometimes I'll go surprise and visit him
at his office or something but we don't
talk all the time but when we do talk
it's good we have a great relationship
it's not forced whatsoever and it's very
chill we're two very chill people we
like to kind of be in our own bubble and
then we'll come out of our bubble and
like talk about everything we like
ketchup so miss Kay mill said I know you
said you don't cry much but what always
makes you cry okay well maybe cry last
night was that movie remember me y'all I
followed my eyes out and I was like it
was Oh God
at the end of the video or at the end of
the movie I'm not gonna spoil it but
once they panned out and I realized what
was going on I like right now I tear up
it was so sad movies will make me cry
I'm a sucker for like a romantic movie
and another thing that makes me cry is
stress if I feel like I'm just way too
stressed out and there's that one thing
that sets me over I will bawl my eyes
out and be done but there's nothing else
that kind of really triggers me crying
Brittany Sherman asked if you couldn't
drive a Jeep what would be your second
option and I was thinking I either
wanted a Jeep this is too totally like a
separate things but they're both SUVs my
two options that I was seriously
considering because I knew I wanted an
SUV was my Rubicon or a Range Rover
Sport I didn't know which one I wanted I
knew the Range Rover be more expensive
like for what you call it oil changes
and like tires and stuff like that and I
didn't know if everybody wanted to like
make that commitment and Rubicon is just
a badass you know once you kind of like
deck it out and stuff and Rubicon's are
fun because it's like you can deck it
out sometimes but then you see something
new and you're like oh crap I want that
on my Rubicon and you just like want to
have fun with it and people think it
looks really nice so I would definitely
go with the Range Rover Sport though if
I didn't get the Rubicon just because I
love the way I keep doing this just
because I love the way that they look
and I love just everything about them
someone asked if I was a stripper what
would my stripper
be I think Candice Candice would
probably be my stripper name I just love
that name and it starts at the seat I
have like this big thing for names that
start with a C I just like really liked
them and I think Candice is a really
pretty sexy name so I would want to be
Candice then it couldn't be Kasey
Purcell the makeup asks do you have a
lot of friends or just a couple close
ones I have just a couple close friends
I mean I have a lot of acquaintances but
I wouldn't tell them my business you
know what I mean so I have a couple
close friends that keep my circle small
oh Jessica
Beth's McAllen asks how do you curb your
cravings when you're trying to stay on
track I have a really big sweet tooth
and one of the things that I have
noticed that really helps me a lot is I
make a smoothie here at the house that
is so sweet and it tastes like a
blueberry milkshake I love it
I'll have to tell you guys or I have to
like show you guys in the vlog one day
but it's a vanilla protein blueberries
strawberries almond butter unsweetened
almond milk and some ice cubes and maybe
even a banana that really satisfies my
sweet tooth craving just cuz that
vanilla protein tastes like a milkshake
so instead where was your first kiss of
davis and is there a funny story along
with it when I first kissed my boyfriend
I drove off and screamed in my car and
he heard my donut that is awesome I love
that he heard you that is freaking
awesome
um well our first kiss was in his car
classic but it was after a long night of
like me wanting to kiss this boy and I
was like I need to kiss him and we were
in his car we were talking and then he
leaned back like in the center console
like had his head tilt back and I was
like perfect about to make my move and I
just kissed him and then it's just like
that's it that's how I happened huh I
was the one that was like I would say
aggressive but I was the one that was
like okay I'm sick of us like not
figuring this out and I was thinking in
my head like well I'm gonna kiss him
because I wasn't too sure what he
thought of me at this moment so I was
thinking like okay I mean kiss him if he
doesn't like it he doesn't like me he
likes it he likes me which one are we
gonna go with
just look at us down Amanda Norwood
asked for more red undertones do you
recommend a more yellow based or pink
based foundation I personally like
yellow based I feel like it really
counteracts that redness I know some
people really like pink but I think pink
is just way too much when my skin is
already red so I like more yellow based
foundations and primers and things like
that I feel like it just looks so much
better on my skin personally yeah I
never like to go by like the undertone
of what my rosacea I like to do if I
like my self tanner and things like that
Olivia Kieran asks what's your closet
most made up of shirts sweaters jeans
etc levy KCl me2 definitely tops I have
a lot of tops because I can wear my same
pair of favorite four or five favorite
pair of jeans however many times in a
row but I have to have a different top
all the time I don't know what it is I
just I love tops tops are my favorite
what is one flaw about you that you
absolutely hate and can't get over I am
a very very paranoid person I don't know
if you were talking about like a beauty
flaw or like a personality flaw but my
personality flaw is I'm very paranoid
everything paranoids me when I go out of
this house I am paranoid I don't
necessarily know why I'm so paranoid but
I am a paranoid with friendships I'm
paranoid with family I'm paranoid with
other people in this world and it's a
really bad habit that I think the worst
is situations like I will automatically
think okay what this happens and what am
I going to do
and I get nauseous I just I don't know I
think it's good sometimes because I'm
aware of my surroundings a lot because
most of the time I'm paranoid about
other people and if I'm out in a big
place like it's on my Walmart or
something like I just get really
paranoid and I don't like it so or at
the mall the mall really makes me
paranoid oh my gosh if I'm by myself I
just like I'm constantly looking around
or just like nervous but that's probably
my biggest flaw because I can't figure
out how to fix it and I try to think
positive about other people as much as I
can but I try to be really realistic at
the same time so yeah I would say that's
my biggest flaw it's just being like I'm
gonna
personally they can kill me like you
know what I mean someone asks if I've
had my lips done yes I have I've been
doing them for over a year now
next August will be two years so I've
been doing them for over a year now I
actually recently just got them plumped
up a little bit because the sides were
kind of going in and just looked really
weird because this part was plump and
this part wasn't so I recently got them
on redone I love my doctor I love them I
don't really have an issue with other
people if they don't like it because it
makes me really happy and yes I do get
them done and no I have never gone with
anyone else to get my lips done I've
always gone by myself that's been
another common question and I figured
out what to say that now and then
someone asked how many kids do you plan
on having and if you guys used to watch
my old Q days I'd be like no I'm never
having kids I do not want kids I want
them now I want like five I know that's
what happens but kids wise it's probably
going to be two or I get in my way for
uh probably two though um it depends I
don't even know how I want to have kids
like if I want to have one baby wait a
year that have another I don't know that
situation but for sure - I don't want
one I want more than one so thank you
