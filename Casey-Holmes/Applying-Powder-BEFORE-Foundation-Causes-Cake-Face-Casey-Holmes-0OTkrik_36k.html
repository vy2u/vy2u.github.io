today we are going to try a different
makeup technique and I wanted to do a
full video on this because I found it so
interesting and I've never tried it
before
and I feel like it's so against
everything we've like been taught
wearing makeup that I just want to try
it out and see how it worked out for me
and my oily skin and the texture and all
of that we're going to test it out today
and that is putting powder before your
foundation I know I was pretty sure too
so don't forget to subscribe before you
leave I'm going to go ahead and get
started with showing you guys this if
you like this videos definitely give it
a thumbs up let me know if there's any
other weird technique I should try in
the comments below if you want to see if
this technique works then let's go ahead
and get started okay so the person sorry
I was glitter on my face - I did like
this I look before I started filming I
took it all off because I didn't like it
and now I have glitter all over my face
because of the steely glitter so the
first part of this video is last night I
was actually watching Jackie inés new
foundation routine and she put on powder
before foundation and I was like if you
don't know who Jackie aina is I'm
obsessed with her as you're such a great
channel her personality is just
top-notch she's hilarious so I will
leave her video down below so you guys
can check it out so after I saw her I
went into the youtube search bar and I
searched powder before foundation and
then Wayne got this video came up so I
watched his his skin looked really good
as well so I'll leave that down below if
you want to get out through those two
videos I was like I'm gonna try this out
I've never tried before we've always
been taught to put liquid foundation
liquid products before powders so I
found this super interesting and yeah
let me know if you've tried it before in
the comments so we're going to start out
I'm going to do what I normally do and
use my regular primers by the way don't
judge my self tanner I'm fixing it
tonight okay
and I'm washing my hair Smashbox primer
water and then you can Austin one they
say to prime first and then put powder
on and then your foundation so that's
how we're going to do it today I'm just
going to go ahead and spread this all
over also if you don't follow me on any
of my social media accounts I announced
my first meetup which is going to be in
Chicago
I'll have all the info down below I am
so excited to have my first meetup for
my Smashbox palette this
excited to go to Cabo I'm so excited to
meet you guys I've never been number
four I'm trying to eat everything that I
see like all the pizza the hot dogs all
of it I hope you see you guys there like
I said I'll have all the information
down below so you guys can check it out
I hope to meet you
so explain your three eyes want to
announce that if you can follow me on my
social to figure out with us keep you
updated I'm going to go ahead and
applying my canon Austin mattifying
primer this is great at kind of evening
out the skin and filling in your pores
now with this powder technique it is
supposed to give you more coverage
without having to use as much foundation
you know I'm saying so you're supposed
to be able to use less foundation when
you set the primer with the powder and
then put your foundation on top they
recommend to use a loose translucent
powder so that's why I'm going to use
today I'm actually trying this new one
from cover FX and it is the perfect
setting powder I've heard so many great
things about this so I figured what the
hell cause we'll put it all right this
looks like this and I'm going to just
set my face with this oh I love that
okay that's awesome it has like a little
lid that flips up and then you could get
the product out that's what I'm talking
about I'm going to apply my powder with
a brush is how I saw Wayne to it he said
that just applies a little bit more
coverage so we're going to see you guys
know I have rosacea really since the
skin a lot of texture girl a lot of
texture and pores you gotta love it huh
I want to say if this doesn't go how I
planned like if I don't like it it is
not against these other two youtubers at
all sometimes things just don't work out
for us people you know what I mean but
it's always fun to try new things I
would say it's a little bit of coverage
it mattified more than anything
you obviously still see my retinas
peeking through and my redness like my
rosacea is kind of a little bit flared
up right now I don't know what's doing
that probably cuz it just got really
cold that's probably what's doing it I
think that the cold is what flares up my
rosacea and if that's the case when I
moved to Fort Drum
I'm going to be tomato so I'm going to
be using the Fiona styles matte finish
foundation and I'm going to brush I'm
using it with this pur cosmetics powder
foundation brush which I like to use for
foundation
this foundation might be a little dark
but we're going to work with okay guys
so I actually just put in a little bit
of a lighter foundation in there because
it was looking like extremely dark
replies to my face they were going to
blend it out with a brush that was a lot
I had the look green on camera that's so
weird I'm just going to blend this out
now I know Jackie likes to pretty much
like stipple it in okay any of whites in
this foundation all those too much I
know Jackie likes to stipple hers in so
I'm just going to do the same thing as
her I think when you think of powder
before foundation I don't know about you
guys but I think of like the awful
setting powders that look so cakey and
just like intense I kind of feel like
the translucent powder it helps though
in the pores even a little bit more like
my foreheads dragged away from me look
at this
Leslie I have mittens on I'm so sorry
I'm sorry I've been busy and I had no
chance or exfoliate my life with
actually think it was really good like
on my cheeks and everything I see my
forehead is a little dry believe it or
not it doesn't look like it but I
believe it's a little dry a little bit
cakey just right in here between my
eyebrows my nose wasn't covered up as
well probably cuz I used a brush and I'm
sponge so I'm just going to go and
really quickly with a sponge and just
try to cover it up a little bit more so
that's what that looks like with powder
on what do you guys think do you see a
difference let me know I think I still
look really dewy which is kind of crazy
I'm definitely going to set after this
so I'm going to be a little extra today
and makes the Urban Decay Naked skin in
light neutral and the tarte concealer in
light medium
Oh
it is Foundation and concealer done I
think that course actually kind of look
a little bit smaller like right in this
area and I haven't even said it yet and
usually baking is like the ceiling poor
Perfector type of thing for me I really
like it normally just makes me look
really extra flawless seeing my skin
looks actually really nice right now so
I'm going to take the same coverfx
powder and I'm going to bake with this
okay so I'm going to light this bit and
I'm going to finish the rest of my face
makeup come back and let you guys know
what I think and if I think you should
try it out or not so stay tuned I will
be right back okay so the rest of my
face makeup is on I have to say I'm
feeling really pretty today
something about no eye shadow a wing
liner and lashes just like makes my
lives and my pearl palette is just
popping right now and my lip color is
the max la girl flat finished pigmented
pigmented gloss in the shade dreamy so
that's what I have on my lips right now
I really like the technique of the
powder setting the primer and then
putting foundation on top I feel like my
pores look so smooth my skin just looks
really I don't know everything looks
fine smooth right now after i justed the
ways of baking it was like great this is
what my skin looks like up close I guess
would you guys before I don't have any
diffusers or anything so I will think I
don't think I would use this technique
every single day but definitely for
going out or something like for tomorrow
I think it looks great I really do I
think it just adds a little something
extra to the foundation and to the rest
of the face makeup everything glided on
really well and suppose where you
supposed to stay on for a lot longer
which LA guys know in the description
box if it lasted a little bit better
throughout the day but honestly I don't
work foundations that don't last well
throughout the day so I love it I think
my makeup looks really do right now I'm
really happy with it so now I just have
to do my hair and we'll be good so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know what you think it down below in the
comments would you try this out if you
have well you think about it I think for
texture skin and pores I think it's
actually a really great technique if you
want to smooth things out a little bit
more and to really lock that primer into
place since my primer does move over my
skin really nicely and still in my port
I think putting the powder on top of
that and setting it into place is kind
of what helps with the smooth look of my
skin and my pores looking really nice
and smooth so I
thumbs up thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you enjoyed it and I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
