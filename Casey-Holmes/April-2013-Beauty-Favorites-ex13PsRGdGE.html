favorites I don't have a ton of stuff
but I have been loving a couple
different things so I figured I would
just go ahead and show you guys so the
first thing I want to talk about is this
blush from benefit this is the Box the
blush and corley stuff and it's just a
really pretty coral color I really love
it it pretty much goes with every look
that I do and I just I don't know I
really like it it's a really pretty
Sheen and it just is not too much for
your skin the next thing I want to talk
about is bronzer and kind of have them
bronzing and contouring my face lately
and I have gone back to two products
that I always love but never put
together so what I like to do is to
bronze my face up with my Mac remine
skin finish and who's this give me Sun
and I've had this for literally like two
years now and it will not go down it's
finally getting rid of the dome shape
but this thing is not hitting pan
anytime soon but this is what looks like
it's just really pretty bronzer I love
to just put this in the areas that you
know someone actually hit and just
bronze up my face not specifically
contour or anything and then I'll go in
with my contour shade this is the Bahama
Mama bronzer from what is this the balm
and I love getting the balm on how it
look because they're always super super
cheap but they only come around every
once in a while this is a super dark
bronzer I did kind of break a little bit
of it but that's just what it looks like
I love this to contour just to use this
and my Mac 109 together they just they
looked so good and the snack 109 is
where it's at next I talked about this
eyeshadow last month but Sigma actually
came out with the resort palette shadows
individually like you can get the
shadows are in that palette individually
so if you didn't like the other shades
you just liked one shade then you could
just go buy that eyeshadow and of course
I have to mention this Sigma eyeshadow
and taupe
this was in the resort palette and I
just love it it's so pretty and I just
love this color for the crease though
definitely recommend this shadow I
talked about last month but I thought
I'd shout it out because they did come
out with them for individual usage I
don't know how you would phrase that for
individual shadows okay so the next
thing is something I've been using so
much this month either for my eyebrows
mainly for my eyebrows but I also use it
for a really quick I look and I showed
this on Instagram as well and it's the
brow bar to go from lightening
lightening and you can kind of see I
have been giving that really dark brown
shade some lovin and I just love this
little thing it's so easy and convenient
that brown on the end is the perfect
shade for my eyebrows and the brush I
actually use is another favorite is the
Sigma flat definer Iike teen which just
looks like this just a flat definer
brush and I like to just shake my brows
with this and then fill them in at the
same time I think it's a great multi-use
product and great for traveling next is
another palette this is just the Naked
basics I've been using this a lot lately
just to give me a really nice neutral
eye and I love it my favorite colors are
naked faint WS and foxy so mainly these
right here in the center the outer - I
don't really use very often but I love
these other colors and they're on that
which is fabulous
other than Venus and I just I love this
palette it's very convenient and the
shadows are super gorgeous together or
just alone by themselves next are my
maybelline color whispers I mentioned
this in my what is it what was it like
must have spring items and these are my
three favorite whispers that I have so I
have this one's this called
petal rebel and I've actually been
loving this a lot I just forgot to
mention in my last month favorites but
that one is a petal rebel I love to use
these by themselves I love to mix them
together I mean I think they're just
great and this one is a coral ambition
which is so freakin
ready and then another one I love is
Allah lilac which is just a nice lilac
color and like I said that last video
they're not super moisturizing I feel
like but they give great color payoff
and I think they're just so pretty for
spring and summer it's just a great
product to have if you want to wear a
color on your list but nothing too
dramatic next I just want to shout out
my Tarte eyelash color this thing is
amazing
I love it so much it curled my lashes so
well and yeah I really recommend this a
couple more lip products I want to talk
about is this wet and wild 4b lipstick
this is in Fergie daily and this is like
a really pretty nude color it is not too
nude something make you look dead and
eventually I'm using this a lot more
than continued by Mac and it looks
really dark on the hand but once you put
it on your lips it's not bad at all and
just I don't know I really like this new
tonight is staring towards it a lot and
again I will make this color whispers
with this nude to kind of give it a
different color and then for gloss I've
been using this NYX butter gloss this is
in creme brulee love this stuff it's
just kind of like a nude gloss but the
texture of this is amazing actually I
have it on my lips now but it's the only
thing I have on and that's it right
there
it has great color payoff and I
definitely want to get more colors
because I think this is great so
definitely try these out if you haven't
yet they're not sticky they just feel
like butter
okay so I've just at the forum makeup
products to talk about I've been loving
the Maybelline master precise eyeliner
I've gone back to this it just has a
really nice felt tip makes it really
easy to get a nice flicked out wing and
I just love it I've also been using my
makeup for ever doing that powder into a
- a lot this month I think it just looks
really nice on the skin over foundation
over maybe cream anything and then I
have gone back to my tried-and-true
corrector I actually like this a lot
better than the Mac prep and prime hi
because I just feel like this works so
much better underneath my eyes and of
course it's the covergirl and Olay
simply ageless corrector I have
definitely put a serious dent in this
thing it's just amazing it doesn't cake
up underneath the eyes it cracks
underneath there and it just looks so
good
so doesn't I recommend this and I do
have it in the correct or shade so it's
not like in the light/medium or anything
like that it's in the corrector okay and
last thing to do with a makeup are these
lash cards and we actually got these in
a empty bag and first I was like what
the hell I'm not gonna use that for
mascara but this is great for eyeshadow
you can just set this on the side of
your eye instead of using tape or
anything and just blend out the outer
half of the eye and it's so awesome I
really like it so different recommend
these little lash cards I mean anything
was like a flat edge you could use
moving on to nail flashes I have two
that I want to mention these are from
the new se collection and this one is
called in the Cabana which is a gorgeous
blue color I love it so much and then I
also want to mention the one I have on
my nails which is first timer and it's
this green color and I think these are
just beautiful shades and I've also been
loving this Mario Badescu Badescu Bisco
whatever like salt like plumbing
cleanser if you want to see this in
action I will link my kit I'm ready
video down below but I actually got this
off hope look a couple months ago and
I've been using it like crazy I think
it's a really amazing cleanser and it
literally does get everything off I
don't have to wash my face like twice or
anything like that to get makeup off so
I really like this stuff two more things
I'm gonna mention this one is the scent
from Bath and Body Works this is in
Aruba coconut so this is what the
packaging looks like I don't think this
is a new scent or anything I think
they've had this one but I don't know
well it says 2013 collection so I'm
guessing it's just from this year but
this smells so good
cream this lotion and they also got the
spray and it just smells like you went
to a tanning bed with that tanning
lotion and it's just it smells so good
I've been loving coconut lately so go
smell these if you're ever end back
money works and then the last thing is
some body shop this is the coconut cream
body scrub and this is what I use to
exfoliate before I self tan and it's
been amazing I love it exfoliates really
well and it smells so good I definitely
want to get the body butter of this
because oh it just smells so freakin
good so I hope you guys enjoyed this
