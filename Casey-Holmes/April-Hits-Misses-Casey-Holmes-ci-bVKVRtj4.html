sharing with you my hits and misses for
the month of April I have a lot of hits
and I have a few misses so I can't wait
to share them with you guys a lot of you
really liked it when I included my music
favorites again last month so we do it
for you again this month okay so I'm
going to just get started first I'm
going to get started with body stuff
because I have four body items and the
first thing I want to talk about I'm
meant to talk about this last month but
I completely forgot about it because it
just stays in my shower but this is a
first aid beauty cleansing body polish
with active charcoal it buffs away
impurities and it's safe for sensitive
skin I have to scrub my back every
single day or else it's going to just
like break out it's just as bad I don't
know why but it's like it doesn't get
exfoliated and then I sweat so much at
the gym and then I'll just start
breaking out so I have to scrub my back
every single day I was using my Kate
Somerville exfoliate which is so
expensive and I'd much rather not use
that on my body because it's just so
insanely expensive when I got this in
the mail I would like oh my gosh finally
this is what I've been waiting for from
first day Beauty because I've been using
a lot of their face products lately and
I just really love the brand I've been
using them for so long even they're red
oily skin line is really great if you
have very oily skin but this is perfect
it's a really nice scrub for your back
it isn't harsh or anything like that but
it really does get all that dead skin
off all that oil out of your skin
because it does have that charcoal in
there which a lot of people like to use
charcoal on their face as well I haven't
used this on my face just on my body and
I love it as you can see like I'm
squeezing out the rest of this I need to
get some more next thing is this Too
Faced royal oil coconut oil body bronzer
I love this for my shoulders it smells
so good
oh it just smells like coconut I love it
but I love to put this like on my chest
and on my shoulders I haven't really
used it on my legs yet because I haven't
honestly wore shorts yet the spring but
using this on the upper part of my body
just has a nice bronze glow to it and it
smells so good I mean I can't get past
the smell that's like one of the main
reasons why I apply this is because this
is also good
another oil product this one I use at
night
it is so oily but you'll see I have used
so much of this product it's almost
halfway gone this is the NARS monoi body
glow - and when I went to an arts event
earlier this month one of the people
told me there that he loved to apply
this on his body I mentioned this in a
vlog if you checked on my vlog you know
I must say but he likes to put this on
the dry areas of his body like his
ankles his hands his elbows things like
that he'll sleep with it on in the next
day it's just nice and smooth I actually
drench my body in this that's why I'm
like halfway out of this bottle but
first off it smells so good and it is so
hydrating I'm telling you I'm the worst
at applying lotion I don't know why but
unless I'm wearing shorts or something I
just don't apply lotion I forget but
this is perfect to apply at night and it
feels like the next morning I have a
whole new set of legs and just body and
glowing and it's just perfect when I do
apply this I do wear like long pants to
bed like sweatpants and also a hoodie
just so it doesn't get all over my
bedding and it's it's perfect I
absolutely love this I'm definitely
going to repurchase another one of those
then the last body product I have is
actually a new purchase and a lotta you
notice this once I got this because it
just sits in the back up here but it is
the Tom Ford soul ale Blanc
oh no oh the parfum Bava this is my
first Tom poor Tom Ford
I am poured out because I bought this
this is my first Tom Ford perfume and
guys okay I went to Saks or whatever
just looking around and I went by Tom
Ford and I was like oh you know these
are so beautiful I wanted to smell them
and she had gave me this one and I was
like yes it smells like the beach it's
beautiful even got the shimmer body oil
which is in my room right now I got that
with it because I just love the scent of
this it literally smells like the beach
sunscreen getting tan I mean it's great
if you don't like that beachy kind of
sunscreen saying you won't like this but
I adore it and when I checked out I was
like you know it's a high-end product
but it ain't gonna be that bad I like
I've paid for your do or was like a
hundred fifteen this will probably be
around that price let me tell you I love
this perfume but I probably won't
purchase it again because it was hella
pricey
I never thought perfumes could be this
pricey this was I think 245 and when I
was checking out how to do two
transactions one for the oil one for
this because I had to order the other
one or whatever and she goes 245 and I
was like ass good good I could not
believe the price for this but I loved
it and honestly you better believe I'm
using this every single day I love it so
much and it does last a really long time
like it's a great perfume but honestly I
probably won't purchase it again
perfumes lasts a really long time
anyways so probably use this for next
year maybe the year after I just had to
tell you guys that little story because
I was flabbergasted and really quickly
before we get into makeup I do want to
shout out one more thing this is the
hair extensions that I use as many of
you know I use the foxy locks extensions
but they did come out with something
different which i think is so nice and I
love these these are the new foxy locks
seamless range so that's what they look
like let me show you what the other ones
look like there's nothing wrong with the
other ones but I really like the
seamless ones as well so this is what
the regular one looks like and these are
the seamless ones you can see right
there there's smaller and they don't
take up as much room they're not very
noticeable Oh what I think these are
really great for first off I wear the
shade milk at off if you guys don't know
that's just the shade up and using and
it matches my hair perfectly but I
really like about these is that they're
so thin it's like they're really
lightweight and you can't tell they're
in your hair at all and I feel like if
you have fine thin hair and you want to
wear hair extensions this would be the
way to go because they're going to lay
so flat to your head that they're not
going to be as noticeable at all you of
course do want to tease your hair a
little bit before you clip them in just
to make sure they don't go anywhere if
you have really fine hair but I think
these are awesome and if you're looking
to buy some extensions from foxy locks
like I said there's nothing wrong with
these I still wear these bad boys like
look at them but if you're looking to
purchase them I would definitely try the
seamless range because they're different
and they're awesome and like I said you
just cannot tell these are in your head
I mean nobody can see them you can
barely feel them they're lightweight I
just love them I will link foxy locks
down below as well
the code that you can get for a free
gift and a lot even wondering if I
recommend these over some other ones I
used to use and I recommend these they
have a lot more hair I feel like they
feel like hair for a lot longer and
they're really really really thick
that's why I use Foxtel extensions some
people are like do you really use them
yes I do if I'm getting ready or
something like right now I have them in
if I'm getting ready and I just want my
hair to look like this with a lot of
volume or if I have a ton of dry shampoo
in my hair and it's straight I will put
in some extensions just to give it more
volume because there is so much hair and
I don't have to use a lot of wefts like
I use three to four wefts
of the Fox luxe extensions and I'm good
to go sometimes I'll even use two just
depending on what kind of look I'm going
for I want to talk about my favorite
foundation I did do a review on this not
too long ago a few videos back but ever
since I did that review I have been
wearing it non-stop and I just love this
finish I love the way it looks and that
is the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer I have been
using it with this brush that I also did
a review on which is the rotating little
motorized brush I've been using this
with that and I just love it even with a
Beauty Blender or regular brush is fine
the only thing I wish is that it was a
pump because I don't think this is Sara
sanitary when I'm breaking out and stuff
like that the coverage is beautiful I do
have rosacea if you don't know and
you're new to my channel I have really
sensitive skin and very oily skin and
this works for me okay
also I just really quickly want to shout
out the laura mercier translucent
setting powder I have been using this
for a really long time god I remember
back in my old apartment days when I had
this stuff I loved it
it is so good and I want to say if you
have oily skin I have noticed a huge
difference when I bake underneath my
eyes and just like my concealer and any
of the places where I get oily I've
noticed that if I bake my makeup last
longer it doesn't get as shiny as
quickly so I highly recommend baking if
you do get very oily I find that this
powder is by far the best because it
doesn't look cakey it's very fine and it
just melts into the skin and sets
everything 100% I think you have to have
it's definitely worth the money kind of
going all over the place so next is a
highlighter and you guys will see I
don't know this video will probably go
up before the Ulta haul because I just
did alcohol but I want to space them out
but I did another Ulta haul and this is
one of the items that I purchased this
is the lorac daylight highlighter I love
this I'm actually wearing it right now
you see that oh my god I love this
highlighter it is so beautiful I love
the packaging that lorac has right now
with these blushes and highlighters I
mean they are killing it I honestly have
nothing bad to say about any of their
products right now and this is what I
just purchased not too long ago and I
think this is a perfect color for spring
and summer when I have a nice tan
because it's a golden glow I also did do
a full tutorial on this look I'm wearing
now with a lot of the products that I'm
mentioning to you guys so that'll be out
really soon this is like my go-to spring
look and you can kind of see all these
products in action so that will be up
for you in just a few videos this is
another new favorite and it's from the
drugstore this is the L'Oreal Paris glam
bronze bronzer for face and body I got
the shade number 2 medium I couldn't
decide between number 2 and I'm guessing
it's called number 3 but the other
darkest one and I went with number 2 and
I'm so glad I did because this is the
perfect bronzer for me it does have
shimmer in it but it looks like it just
has like a glaze on top because once you
get down deep I mean it does have I
guess it has like a golden shimmer to it
but it's not bad at all it's not chunky
glitter or anything like that you won't
even be able to tell that I had a
shimmery bronzer on my face right now it
is the most beautiful drugstore warm
bronzer that I have tried I love that I
can build this up I love the color I
love the consistency and it's so
blendable if you see this in your
Walgreens I highly recommend checking it
out you get a ton of product I will say
this was 14.99 so it was kind of pricey
so ever since I got this I have been
using it like crazy and then another
bronzer that I want to quickly shout out
that is high-end is this Too Faced
sweethearts bronzer in sweet teeth this
is a very like warm bronzer and this one
just looks like you got a nice tan I
don't know it's so beautiful they both
just look really really good on the skin
so if you're looking for more high-end
definitely get the Too Faced sweet tee'
bronzer it is gorgeous blends so well if
you want drugstore definitely pick this
one up I think it is amazing ok so the
next thing is the Too Faced better than
sex
waterproof mascara ok this is awesome I
love the original better than sex
to face mascara and this is just perfect
for spring and summertime I'm so happy
they did this it has the perfect formula
just the same as the original one it
doesn't like anything like that and when
it says waterproof it is waterproof this
is what I'll be wearing all spring and
summer long I absolutely adore this it's
just the cutest little packaging has
like a little water droplets on it
reminds me of that matte collection back
in the day what was it D like aqua
collection something like that where I
had the little droplets this is just
like that and it is so good I've used it
for both my top and bottom lashes and
it's it's amazing and I'm telling you
this stuff is waterproof so to help get
that off I found that this was freaking
awesome so I never wore waterproof
mascara until I got that one because I
was like yes of course I'm gonna wear it
because it's the better than sex in
waterproof form so I didn't have like a
waterproof makeup remover so luckily
they sent this in the pr package and i
tried it out and this is a freaking
awesome proper soft that's compact if
you are traveling or something like that
and you want and makeup remover or like
a waterproof mascara remover that is
compact this is the way to go
all you do is you take it out of the
tube and it just looks like this and you
just coat your lashes with it i coat
from the front and in the back and it
just comes off like once you start
washing your face all the mascara comes
off and you have your lashes back try
taking off that waterproof mascara with
other makeup removers and it just was
not it wasn't code off but this helped
it come off so well it literally does
melt off I have two products from the
makeup revolution brand I love this
again you will be seeing these in a haul
very soon and also with this makeup look
this is the ultra blush palette and this
is in the shade hot spice and first off
I love the compact like I love the
mirror I love everything about it and
this is what the blushes look like and
they are just stunning I'll include a
different clip where you can kind of see
them up close but I just love this
palette the blushes are so pigmented
they blend so well I'm wearing them
today if you're looking for a blush
palette from the drugstore this brand is
the way to go they're really nice
they're very affordable I mean you get a
ton of product and then this is what
I've been contouring with lately and I'm
just obsessed with it it's the makeup
revolution
your contour palette and they also have
a yellow shade in here but I haven't had
a chance to dip into that just because
I've been baking and stuff so I've kind
of stayed away from yellow powders but
this is a really nice formula it's
really nice and smooth I've been using
the contour shades and I love them they
blend so well and I love the way they
carve out that cheekbone so I want to
say what I have been using to contour is
the Real Techniques contour brush I used
to use this all the time and I just
recently started getting back into it
and I love it
it just blends so well and these two
together are like a drugstore contour
love affair like these are amazing and I
highly recommend these two together so
drugstores killin it lately
I mean come on one more thing for eyes
and we're going to move on to lips which
you guys can probably guess the lip
products I'm going to talk about but
this is the NYX wonder pencil in light
and I like this for my waterline I don't
really like a super white waterline it's
a little too bright for me sometimes
unless I really need that this is more
of like a light skin tone and I love the
way that it looks and brightens the eye
perfectly make sure eyes look a little
bit bigger and it's really nice and
creamy and easy to work with so this has
been one of my favorites as well and
then moving on to lips I did a full
video on these Kylie Jenner lip kits my
two favorites are 22 and Dulce K if you
want to check out this video I will
leave it down below I also did a
tutorial with 22 and I will leave that
down below as well and Dulce Kay is like
my everyday color weather I've been
reaching for the lip liner or the liquid
lipstick just been using Dulce case so
much lately and 22 is just a great like
this would this would look great with
this look but I wanted to do a glossy
lip but I love this and speaking of
glossy I did use Dulce K as my lip liner
today and I used this gloss in literally
on top I find that literally is like
Dulce K and lip gloss form like it's
perfect only thing I don't like is the
brush I think I got the last brushes are
like the first brushes I don't know I
don't think I got the shorter brushes
but that's literally oh it is just it's
like Dulce K and lip gloss for they're
so glossy I've had this on for like an
hour now and it's not moving at all it
feels just as glossy and it looks just
as good as I did when I
first put it on and I wore it out the
other day and it lasted a long time like
drinking and all of that out of the
straw out of straw
you guys want a video on it let me know
I know everyone's doing videos on these
Kylie cosmetics but it's because
everybody's curious okay let's get on to
the missus the first two you're going to
know about the last one I haven't
discussed but I cannot stand it so the
first one is the Laura Geller baked
radiance cream concealer I've been
waiting to put this in my hits and
misses video so I can go ahead and
return this through this in Ulta haul
and try on this was very creamy but it
was so thick oh my gosh and my oily skin
was just not having it it was terrible
absolutely terrible for my skin I mean
maybe if you have dry skin you'll like
this but I cannot work with it it was so
thick it was just too much I just
couldn't do it so sorry Laura Geller but
she has great products so don't let that
fool you and then the next thing is the
Charlotte Tilbury magic foundation and I
did a full first impression on this I
don't really like it at all I'm sorry to
say it um this is more of a medium
coverage foundation I've seen a couple
other people review this and they had
you know problematic skin as well and
they also said that it was a medium
coverage so I know I'm not crazy because
I was like this is not full coverage
this is definitely medium coverage I
didn't like the finish and I didn't like
the way that a war on my skin it made me
really oily and it just wasn't my
favorite so I would pick up the clinic
one over this one if you're in the
market for a new foundation but the
packaging is so pretty I had really high
hopes for this but it just didn't work
out so yeah the last one now this I had
high hopes again for this but I feel
like some of you've been waiting for me
to try this foundation out because I've
been asked so many times but guys this
was terrible for my skin it's the Milani
concealer perfect two-in-one foundation
concealer in sand beige I bought like
five shades which really sucks because I
didn't know what color I was going to be
I was buying online and I can't find the
receipt so I can't return it I thought I
was really going to love this because
everybody loved it and I was like okay I
gotta get all the shades and make sure I
have my rent shades so that way from tan
if I'm not tan I've got a shade from me
and now I'm like
and I really regret that it has really
great packaging it's a glass bottle and
it has a beautiful pump I mean the
gradient effect that it has going down
to the color is just stunning but it
says meet him to full coverage I totally
agree this is definitely a full coverage
foundation put it on and I was like okay
this is good coverage and it had a
little bit of a doing this to it but I
was thinking you know once I said with
powder and baked it'll be fine I sent my
makeup and everything I was so oily and
greasy within like an hour
it was so bad and it just did not look
good on my skin at all in my pores it
just was not it wasn't working for me so
unfortunately this did not work out I'm
really really bummed about it just
because I had such high hopes for it and
it does look nice on the skin when you
first apply it but wearing it after like
an hour on me it was just not working so
sorry to be the bearer of bad news I'm
like the only person that doesn't like
that I feel like that's me I feel like
when a lot of people like something I
try it out and I'm just like but I don't
like it because I have such oily skin
and it's temperamental now we are going
to talk about music favorites I can't
remember if I have a lot and music
