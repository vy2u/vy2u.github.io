a first impression on this artists or
artists oval-8 brush I have seen these
everywhere and at first I was like what
the heck is that big ol brush and
supposedly they are really good very
very very expensive the only thing I
could focus on with like buying this
brush for the review is how expensive it
was this was $80 which i think is insane
but supposedly the quality is really
good I want to say I'm sorry for my
voice I've been losing my voice for a
like almost a week now and I don't
understand why because I don't feel sick
I just don't have my voice so we are
going to just kind of go into this and
basically let's read the back of this
this is the oval-8 and it says the art
artists I should probably should have
figured out how to pronounce this so if
I'm saying it wrong I'm sorry just let
me know but it says the artist flew into
oval-8 is slightly smaller than the oval
tin it has hundreds of thousands of
fibers and an oval shape to provide
application to a large area of the face
this patented brush is perfect to apply
foundation or setting powder to the
entire face or apply and Brent brand or
apply and blend bronzing and
highlighting cards to entire areas of
the face so this kind of explains right
there shows you where you can use a
brush and it comes in this really nice
package that I'm going to keep because I
paid $80 for it I haven't opened this
haven't touched it or anything but this
is it it's like a velvet packaging and
then you pop that open oh my god this is
he bigger than I thought it was going to
be so that's what it looks like ooh
that's huge it's really lightweight
though like I mean obviously this part
is heavier just because it has so many
bristles but the actual handle and
everything is really light I don't know
how I'm going to contour and highlight
with this we shall see there's like not
any directions or anything with this it
just says it says that this brush is
perfect to apply foundation or setting
powder to the entire face or apply a red
blend bronzing or highlighting powders
to the area of the face okay so May
I want to try it off for Foundation and
we'll just do highlight - I don't think
you're supposed to apply your concealer
with this well it does say that candies
for concealer but I don't know I mean
maybe that would work out I guess we'll
try concealer - but supposedly you're
not supposed to rub it in you're just
supposed to glide it on your face like
this and this actually feels really nice
and feels like a spa I have applied my
primers moisturizers and everything I
did use this I wanna shout it out real
quick this is the benefit Porefessional
matte rescue this is amazing I don't
know if it's come out yet it wasn't a
pure set that I got but oh my god if you
have oily skin you are going to love
this is so good for foundation I am
going to use the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation and this is the one I know
that I love and I use this with a brush
so I thought it would be perfect to try
this out and I'm going to try the shade
33 beige hopefully it matches them well
myself tan is kind of like rubbing off
right now
I'm just going to put four spots on my
face see how messy this good and then
I'm going to take this brush I'm just
going to glide it like they say -
think I should just applied one drop and
then did the rest of it
so it feels really smooth on the skin it
seems to be blending everything out
nicely looks really really good the
foundation I feel like it's look at that
redness right there oh hello it's like
not a lot of work you know because
you're just gliding it and I feel like
when most people put on their foundation
you don't necessarily think to just I
look so yellow right now in this
lighting ooh sorry
but I don't think most people say to
glide because you usually want to buff
it in but this does not look bad right
now this is a huge brush I don't know
like I said this one can be used for
concealer but we're just going to wing
it and see even though we can't Pat it
in I'm just going to glide it in and one
thing I was nervous about was that this
brush wasn't going to cover up the
redness on my nose because usually when
I do foundations on my nose I have to
like Pat them in because I have so much
redness right in there but this one is
covering up really well just for rubbing
so that's awesome and I'm really
impressed by that so I can check that
off my list okay so so far I do like it
I think that it blended everything onto
the skin really nicely I don't see like
a like a physical difference between
this and using my face buffer brush
which is what I use of this foundation
by makeup geek I don't see like a huge
difference there but it was quicker to
use this since it was so big and it just
glided across my face and if I could use
this for multiple different purposes
that would be awesome too so I'm going
to go ahead and apply some concealer and
try it out so this is the Stila aqua
glow serum concealer I used light/medium
this is a new concealer I've been using
and
being a China to use as much concealer
but literally first thing I do is
positive absolute of concealer just
because I love concealer and I'm like no
I want more I haven't seen anyone talk
about this concealer but I really love
it it feels so good on the skin I
believe it's pretty new I was going to
get the serum foundation so how you feel
Rose I'm very nervous to apply this
right now okay let's start with this
right here always really easy to just
blend in and then like takes like a
couple swipes I'm going to worry so much
about my nose like not being covered as
well okay that was easy
okay now I'm going to take it and slip
it
I kind of like that that you could just
swipe it up like that and it looks
really good
okay I feel like I see some redness
coming through store it pretty nifty the
only thing is I have to get in my inner
corner so I'm going to take this brush a
little small brush and get right in the
inner corner area to brighten that up
okay so I feel like the concealer looks
really good the thing I just noticed
most about this is it's just really
quick to blend everything in instead of
dabbing with like a Beauty Blender or
taking my smaller face buffer brush been
really buffing it in so this also says
you can apply setting powder to the face
I don't know how you would apply setting
powder powder only thing I wish about
this is like they had instructions
inside the box I don't want to go look
online for instructions I'm just seeing
inside it but that's okay I'm going to
take this new powder that I bought and
I'm so excited to try it a pretty sure
this is new but it's the Dior skin
forever and ever control it's a matte
perfection powder or like a matte loose
setting powder that's pretty how pretty
is that so this is just in 0 0 1 is just
translucent what has a little sifter and
nice so I'm just gonna like dip my brush
in here can I tap off any excess and I
guess just swipe Pat I don't know what
to do I'm just going to Pat because I
don't feel like swiping powder on my
face I'm pretty sure I'm probably gonna
get yelled at in the comments for doing
this wrong but homegirl doesn't know
they didn't give me directions but hey I
gotta say patting the pattern is nice I
feel like if you feel like you did too
much you could always just go back over
after you've applied it and just kind of
brush it away just pop this brush feels
so nice I'm going to use the Sun Tan
matte bronzer by Smashbox since it says
it can be used for bronzer just gonna
tap it in I'm kind of nervous I'm gonna
start with my forehead just again I get
a feel for it
wipe that off is not cute but let's just
kind of go wow it really blends that
like look at that that is gorgeous
that's the kind of contour for my
forehead that I die for and the thing
about this is you can use the tip of the
brush to really get in there and blend
it out I love that I love that it just
blended that out so well and then I go
in with more it picks up a lot of
products so you don't need to put a lot
on the brush but if you're like me and
you do just like I did there you could
go back in and just blend it out which
is pretty damn amazing because sometimes
you can't blend this stuff out it's
incredible all right let's try to
contour it take the edge of it and oh
it's a little low so it's just kind of
buff it up or like swipe it up it's not
a bad contour but it's a little bit
lower than I prefer God but it blends
everything out like it really it really
blends everything out which is
impressive to me
so like watch this line I do wipe off
the excess after I see how much product
I have on my face because this just will
blend it all out just so crazy to me
like look at that that's probably like
one of my favorite contour jobs I've
ever done that looks so beautiful to
think that was like a sharp line is
insane the one thing I can do with this
brush is contour my nose maybe a smaller
one which I think would be amazing like
to have a smaller one of these to just
blend out my nose contour oh my god it'd
be like effortless beautiful I think
it's so interesting how this brush
doesn't need to be like buffed in it
just needs to be swipes on the face that
is so interesting to me and it's really
cool so okay you passed the bronzer test
now let me see that package again it
says bronzing or highlighting powders so
I'm not going to do blush with it um
even if I want to I kind of want to just
do my whole face with it even if it is
wrong even if I'm not supposed to do it
I want to do it I'm going to use this
Too Faced love flush blush in baby love
which is a great just like a neutral
pink color it's one of my favorites okay
I'm just going to dip this brush in here
and then we're just going to apply like
this leaf
I think I like this for blush I mean
you're probably not supposed to apply
with this brush but if you pay $80 for
it you kind of want to be an all-in-one
I mean it's nice it applies the blush
nicely but it's really kind of awkward
for me and I feel like I just want to
Pat it when you're not supposed to Pat
it so mmm not a big fan of using this
one with a brush then again it doesn't
say you're supposed to so I could be
completely wrong I'm going to take
heatwave by Estee Lauder and highlight
with this again I'm just going to take
the edge of it this highlight is like
intense enough so like watch me mess
this up and I'm just going to brush this
on okay I don't really see that when you
take the tip of this
I like that it's like more diffused
because this highlight is intense if you
build it up but I feel like this brush
kind of diffuses it which is nice
because this is a very pigmented
highlighter like don't let this brush
fool you this highlighter is intense I
feel like the highlighter isn't as great
with this brush in my opinion but it
does look beautiful still this pulao
highlight my nose because I need to
contour it anyways so that is blush
bronzer and highlight done with that
brush and what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to kind of gather my thoughts
and finish the rest of my makeup and I'm
going to come back and let you guys know
what I think of this if you should
purchase it and all of that other stuff
so if you want to see my final review
then just keep watching okay so now that
I finished up the rest of my face makeup
I'm going to go ahead and tell you guys
what my final thoughts are on this
little beauty so first off the price tag
sucks because it was $80 for this brush
now what I did like this for I did like
it for foundation I liked it for
concealer I also loved it for bronzer
and I did like it for highlight I think
it did a really good job on all of those
I did not like it for blush it wasn't my
favorite um but one thing I will say is
with the foundation I didn't notice like
a huge end result I do take a little bit
longer with you face buffer brush
because it's smaller and you have to
really work it into the skin but I
didn't know the difference between
taking the time and doing that and then
finishing off with this now this like I
said did take less time I just swiped it
all over and I was done went straight to
concealer and then bronzer and then of
course the highlight what I loved next I
think this would be a great brush if you
kind of just want to purchase one brush
to do different jobs this one did for
different jobs for me and if you want to
kind of roundabout
of how much four different brushes will
cost I would say they would be $80
because good brushes usually are about
20 apiece if you get them individually
sometimes they're cheaper but let's just
go with a solid 20 it's about $80 for
four brushes and then it's a
for this one so it's kind of personal
preference what you guys want to do I do
like this for just a quick application I
think it works really really well and I
really just think if you're going to
purchase it it definitely is all about
personal preference what what you want
to use it for if you want to spend the
money on it and how you think it works I
haven't really seen any negative reviews
on this other than just the price tag
and the handle is really light it's not
like it's really hard to work with it's
not very heavy or anything like that
most of the weight is here with the
bristles the best because there's
hundreds and thousands of bristles and
another thing I like about this is it
does feel really good on the skin so
basically I don't think this is a
necessity I think it is if you're a
makeup lover and want to try different
brushes and try like different things
this would be really cool to try out I
think you would really love it if you
did try it out and want to spend the
money on it and so I'm deciding to keep
it just because it did do four different
jobs for me and I love the way that it
blended out my bronzer I think that was
like the best part for me was the
bronzer because I feel like my bronzer
looks really good now the blush I didn't
like at all but the foundation and
concealer I did like I'll probably use
my Beauty Blender for my concealer but
if I just want to go from foundation rub
it off and then quickly go to concealer
if I'm in a rush I can do that with this
brush so if you guys have tried this
brush out let me know in the comments
below or if you've tried other brushes
from them like I know they have some eye
shadow brushes and things like that but
I don't know how I would like them
because they look very interesting but
let me know if you tried any of these
out what your thoughts are below in the
comments and don't forget to like this
video if you liked it and subscribe to
my channel to see more videos and yes I
will see you guys on Thursday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
