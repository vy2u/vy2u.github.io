August favorites I have quite a bit of
new stuff to show you guys so I'm gonna
try to go ahead and like and get through
this I'm gonna start with hair products
first and the first thing I really have
been loving this month is the red can
wax last ten I think this is great if
you curl your hair and stuff and you
want something to give it more texture
and kind of help hold it in place but
you don't really want a hairspray I
really recommend this it's really nice
just to spray like I'll do it right now
since my hair is a hot mess and then
just run your fingers through it and it
kind of like mends certain pieces
together and it's just really nice you
could play with it a little bit and get
it the way you want it so I absolutely
love this stuff it's been amazing next
is this 12 bitten face instant healthy
hair treatment I talked about this in my
summer most warned things tag I
absolutely love this stuff I don't know
where you can get it I would try to
google it or Amazon but it's one of the
best hair treatments I've tried I
usually apply this before I blow-dry it
is a thicker treatment but is literally
one of the best I've ever tried in my
life stuff really really recommend that
next thing is this John Frieda Frizz
Ease heat defeat styling spray I love
this stuff I'll apply this in my hair
before I blow-dry it and it's just been
like everyday use thing for me I've
loved it every purchase it a few times
and it's just been a great little thing
to try and I think it's like like three
or four dollars or something like that
it's pretty cheap so I really like this
stuff and then last but not least is a
new oil I've been tried I've tried a lot
of oils but this one has definitely
taken the cake so far out of all the
ones I've tried it's the new me prepare
intense pure remedy oil and I really
like this it makes my hair feel so so so
so soft I don't know if my camera's
focusing I hope it is and you get so
much product in this and you really
honest-to-god only need like a tiny bit
of this because it can make your hair
feel a little greasy so just be careful
with that but this has been one of my
favorites I've been using this all month
on my ends and is me my hair so so soft
so on to make up I'm just gonna zoom
through this whole first one of course
it's the Urban Decay Naked palette I use
a lot talked about a lot this month it's
just
my all-time favorite thing ever next I
want to talk about this toner this is
from oh is it leaking oh I think I
didn't seal it all the way but this is
the high drops of tone age-defying toner
I actually like to use is before I apply
moisturizer and stuff I really feel like
it gets my scent my skin super clean and
I just really like it and I feel like my
moisturizer works a little bit more when
I apply this toner ok this product I
talked about in my last space routine I
did like either a month or two ago but I
had a sample of this and it absolutely
loved it and they were recently on
HauteLook I think like a few weeks ago a
month ago but it is the hydroxy tone
instant effects 90 second wrinkle
reducer and I'm obsessed with this
you basically after I put my moisturizer
on I'll apply this I'm underneath my
eyes it has a little pump and you only
need like your Chinese Chinese bit and I
like apply this underneath my eyes and
you sit there for 90 seconds just like
you don't move or anything like that and
you really just let it sit on your skin
and you can feel it tightening and for
me what it does is it makes my under eye
area so smooth
it fills in the fine lines that I have
and it's just so like tightening it just
feels amazing and I really feel like
it's working also and I'm pretty sure
the little thing you said that this also
helps over time like if you have fine
lines or anything like that so I really
love it I've been using it every day
since I've got it and I got on HauteLook
with this lasha tone thing haven't used
it but I got those two on HauteLook for
$35 and I think I don't know if this is
the full size but the full size at Ulta
is $60 so I was like yep
love it next is a BB cream I never
thought I could wear a BB cream but I
have been obsessed I have it on today
I've been wearing it every day so far
this month and this is the anti-aging BB
creams - the one is from hi drops of
tone as well and mine is in tan they say
to go up a color from what you think
you'd be and it matches perfectly I love
it so this has been great I apply it
every morning and what I do is I apply
it and then when I saw him Akbar bo7
like one of her videos she buffed out
her BB cream with a brush so I do that
too and I really like
finish it gives this is just a crown
brush brush I'm not sure the name but
I'll just buff it out with that and
literally I think this BB cream gets
even better as the day goes on because
like my skin looks so natural have like
problem pores around here and I don't
know if you would say it fills them in
but it really just makes them like
shrink and just look amazing and one of
the reasons why I've never tried to BB
cream is because most of them if you've
ever heard of them which you probably
have they are very moisturizing and
that's the word I love to avoid because
I have oily skin I cannot have any extra
moisture that I don't already have this
is actually a great one for oily skin
because it dries matte I would set it
with a powder though but I have super
oily skin and this has been one of my
all-time favorite products not to
mention I don't break out from it and
it's just amazing and it's also great
for your skin SPF 40 all of that so love
it that was a mouthful and concealers I
have to read it just depends on the day
but of course the Revlon age defying
concealer and medium you guys have seen
this a ton um I actually just did a
concealer video so I'm not going to talk
too much about it
and then the Rimmel match perfection
concealer I use this in a triangle too
just right in my under eye area and then
if I want an extra flawless finish I
will use the Make Up For Ever full cover
concealer number ten but lately for
everyday use these three have been my
favorite just the Revlon the Rimmel and
the BB cream they've been amazing to me
I'm always sensor for bronzers I have
two this one I just like started getting
back into and I have it on today but
this is the Mac mineralize skinfinish
and give me Sun this is like a bronzer
that's what it looks like it is a fully
matte bronzer and it kind of can come
off orange so you have to be careful
with it I would not contour with it but
I take my said don't release 8:13 brush
which looks like this and I'll dust it
in here and I'll apply it on my cheeks
I'll go down right underneath my jaw
bone and it will also take it to the
tops of my forehead and it literally
gives like the prettiest bronzed glow to
your skin like it just looks really
natural really pretty and it's really
not too much
so I have been really loving this I'm so
glad I just decided to start using it
again okay so the next thing I want to
talk about is this so late and a Chanel
bronzer I have been obsessed like this
is my baby I purchased this at
Bloomingdale's about a month ago I
showed it in a hall that I had but it is
one universal shade you guys let me know
that was one universal shade sorry I
didn't know but this foot looks like
it's just a cream bronzer now don't be
afraid if you have oily skin because it
dries to a matte finish it sort of feels
like a cream to powder thing for me it's
just amazing and it doesn't like leave
any greasy Nisour make you a li
throughout the day or anything like that
so don't be scared if you have only skin
to try this because I know I was but I'm
totally happy with it I don't know if
they still sell it I know it was a
summer product they might not have it
anymore but maybe eBay or something I
don't recommend buying makeup on eBay
and stuff but do what you do don't
matter to me so what I do is I take my
Sedona lace fvo v which is a nice little
contour brush and I just kind of put it
in the product just a little bit because
a little bit tests go a long way and
then I kind of put the brush in here and
kind of roll around in any excess I have
will go on the list so when I apply it
to my face it's not gonna be like whoa a
liner bronzer so I just take it and I go
right underneath my cheekbone kind of
where I would contour but I don't just
focus it right here I sort of go right
here on my jaw line and I take it up and
I go on the top of my forehead and it's
literally amazing like I have not found
a bronzer like this before that is just
a freakin Holy Grail product so I don't
really contour nowadays I just basically
kind of shade my face a little bit more
so it just kind of shapes the face not
necessarily contour and like have like
defined super chiseled cheekbones umm if
I want that going out I have a bronzer
for that but this is more for everyday
and what I've personally been loving so
I love this product it was totally worth
the money and I highly recommend it I
also love that went wild princess
bronzer that I mentioned in my 10 things
I would repurchase tag I like a down
below if you haven't seen it but that is
a very dark bronzer too and I
to do that in the three motion like I
said in my video but that is so dark and
it's more for June July than it is for
August if that makes any sense probably
makes absolutely no sense but it's a lot
darker so if you're like at the beach or
you have that really nice tan skin then
that bronzer in a three motion will make
you look like a frickin bronze goddess I
love it
all right and then this is the very last
thing I want to show you guys it has
been my favorite blush of the month I
don't think I've used another blush this
month I'm honest to god don't think I
have this is the Rimmel London autumn
catwalk blush and this is what looks
like this is seriously the most
beautiful blush ever I love it so much I
just mix the colors all together because
I'm too lazy to do anything else and it
just has the most gorgeous color and it
really just makes your cheeks stand out
but nothing like to clownish or crazy
it's so soft so pigmented I think this
was like five bucks or something but I
will not be surprised if I hit pan on
this very soon because it's just that
amazing I love it
it does have some shimmer in it but it's
not like overpowering or anything like
that it doesn't look like glitter on
your face so I love this again it is in
autumn catwalk from Rimmel London one
more thing I want to quickly throw in
here I'm gonna getting a lot of
questions on the cross bracelet I've
been wearing lately I actually have it
right here I love it so much this is
from shop glam candy calm my friend Jen
who is XO brunette Barbie on here she
actually started her own jewelry site
and she has the cutest stuff ever don't
forget if you ever are curious about
what I'm wearing I always have it listed
in the downbar with the sites and links
or whatever you need for it but this has
been one of my favorites it just has
like the little rhinestones and it's
just so gorgeous and so like dainty it's
just beautiful I think I'm gonna get my
mom one for her birthday because she
really loves this also but that's where
I got that from so I hope you guys
