August favorites and I have a lot of you
stuff to show you guys I'm really
excited about and some things I've had
for a while and I just kind of got back
into using so I'm just excited to show
you guys so I'm gonna get started with
makeup and the first thing I want to
talk about is my favorite primers of the
month I've really gotten into primers
lately and I just honestly can't get
enough of them so the first one is the
benefit Porefessional primer I used to
use this back in the day I explained it
all on my sport hall which I'll link
below if you haven't seen it but I used
to have this give it away designed
repurchase it cuz my skin has been
changing due to some products that I
will show you in this video as well and
it works amazing on my skin I love it
for pores it's so amazing you can't
really large pores like I do I'm very
self-conscious about them and I look for
everything that I can to try to minimize
them I've tried different primers from
the drugstore from high-end - this is
the only one that actually makes your
pores look significantly smaller so I
really really enjoyed this and then to
go who on the mattifying side of things
because this one I feel like is really
great for the pores but I don't feel
like it mattifies as well as I would
like so I do apply this first and then I
go in with this it's the Mac prep and
prime skin refine zone treatment and
this is really really nice for oily skin
all I do I spray about I'd say a dime
sized amount and I rub it between my
fingers and then I just press it into my
skin just like I do the Porefessional
but I use this one all over my face and
it really helps keep me matte I really
really like this it's definitely for
girls with oily skin if you have dry
skin I stay away from it but it's
awesome I absolutely love this primer
and I'm really happy I found two primers
that I feel like I can use all the time
and they do everything that I want them
to do you know keep my makeup on
minimize my pores and still keep you
matte throughout the day okay and then
the next thing I'll talk about is the
two foundations I've been loving this
month first one is my Dior air flash
foundation since at number 300 I
absolutely adore this I think it's
amazing and I do have to use a
mattifying primer with this so if you
have oily skin I definitely recommend
you a more of a mattifying primer
underneath it it's not I'm talking about
if you have really really really oily
skin if you have combo Orly I think you
might be okay but really oily skin girls
I feel yeah it's hard work to find stuff
that actually keeps you mat but this is
really nice with a mattifying primer and
I just love it and then the next one is
one I'm wearing today and I use this at
beautycon and I've really just been
enjoying it so much lately it's the
hourglass immaculate liquid powder
foundation
it's mattifying an oil-free I love this
product I got the color light beige and
it's a little light for me but I can use
bronzer darker powers whatever tell
match my face a little bit more but I
love this the only drawback I said this
in my last video which if you haven't
seen my what's in my travel makeup bag I
will link that below as well and at the
end of this video whenever you apply
this you have to be careful with it I
now do it in sections like I'll put some
on this cheek buff it in this cheek buff
it in center of forehead and then up the
top before head I do it in sections
because whenever you buff this and you
need to make sure you have it completely
done the way you want it because if you
try going back in with your brush you're
really gonna break up that foundation I
tend to do that a lot on my nose because
I'm always trying to contour my nose or
put concealer on my nose I don't know
just trying to fix it because so I
always tend to break it up on my nose so
I'm really careful about it now but
that's the only downside I say about
this otherwise I mean it's a really
great foundation I'm going to talk about
the lip products I've been using
literally all month this is been like my
go-to combo it's what I have right now
it's what I have in most of my videos
for this month so a matte lipstick in
hue I love this color it's just like a
pink nude color I mean it's great it
pretty much goes with any look than I do
and then my Mac Pro Longwear lip glass
and a patience plea patience please
again it's a really nice pink nude color
and it just looks really good on top of
it I like it it's not too nude and it
stays on for a very very long time also
to go along with the lips I've been
using my
Stila lip liner
aspiring I love this lip liner it just
looks really good a lot of you asked me
if I've had lip injections this month
and I said no I haven't gotten all I've
been doing is just lining my lips with
this and actually kind of outlining it a
little bit more than my actual lips so
it looks a little bit more plump and
then you know with lip gloss and
everything on top it just looks really
nice and full really quick I want to
mention I've been using my Naked basics
palette a lot this month and I just
think it's a great neutral palette I
think this is honestly better than the
naked palettes to be quite honest with
you I get the most use out of this one
and it just happens basically all matte
shades other than Venus which is like a
satin color but I think this is a great
palette if you're just starting out with
makeup or you just want to buy your
first high-end palette this is
definitely the one that I would purchase
and for another eyeshadow I'm sure a lot
of you will not be surprised
it's Teela's eyeshadow and kitten oh I
love this color it's beautiful you guys
if you never tried it you go try it out
it's just like a velvety gorgeous creamy
shadow and it's just beautiful I love it
for all over the lid and the inner
corner it's beautiful we're down to the
last makeup products I do have my wise
sell mascara and baby doll I think I'm
gonna do a video on this and show you
guys the difference with my lashes so
let me know if you want to see that down
below in the comments but I love this
it's the only high-end mascara I've ever
purchased and I don't regret it at all
it was you know the best purchase I've
ever made for mascara so I love this
it's just in black and it really makes
my lashes look false I haven't worn any
false lashes throughout the month
because I feel like this mascara does
the job moving on to brows I have
changed up what I've been using on my
brows I'm now using the Anastasia brow
Wiz in brunette I really like this I
have not my brows now I feel like it
just looked so much more natural and you
can really fake the hairs with this like
because you can do really light strokes
and fill in the front part right here
unlike powder it would be really really
hard to do that so you can really just
feather it out very lightly in the inner
part of your eyes starting flicking you
off but you can just better it out in
the very inner part of your eyebrow and
then darken it out as your eyebrow goes
towards the end and it just looks for
natural I love it it's easy to use it
has a little spooley on the end right
here and I love the spoolie I feel like
it really blends out the pencil very
nicely so I think this is a great
purchase I really like it
that's how I start for the face because
I love my face products and this is the
benefits hello flawless powder and
toasted beige just has been my go-to
powder to make my face match my neck and
body a lot more
whenever I'm self-tanning and I'm using
like hourglass foundation or something
and I really love this it looks so nice
on the skin never looks cakey
alright favourite bronzers of the month
for the ones who actually bronze up my
skin it's been the Bobbi Brown bronzer
in golden light this is a beautiful
beautiful shade I've been using this
non-stop ever since I got it and I don't
regret buying it I know it was expensive
but I have not bought a new bronzer in a
long time so I was ready to buy a new
one and this is one I chose and I
absolutely adore it I think it's so
beautiful on the skin I've been using my
hoola bronzer from benefit and this is
one of those products that I put in my
door I'm gonna now go back to it in a
month and then I mention it in my
favorites video be like why did I ever
stop using it one of the best bronzers
I've ever tried and I love this to use
to just kind of sharpen out my contour a
little bit more it's beautiful I really
really enjoy it best product is my Dior
skin air flash matte touch this is
amazing for oily skin if you have any
dry patches on your face stay away from
it because it will cling to your dry
patches because it is focused on keeping
you map so I love this it says 0:01 it
does have a hint of color to it so you
know be aware of that when you're
spraying it on your face because I
didn't know the first time and I had
like beige powder throughout my hair but
this is so beautiful I mean honestly I
wanted to take this to beautycon so bad
but I was afraid this thing's been like
exploding the plane get all of my stuff
and I was not gonna have that makes you
look airbrushed again and of course with
this it's like freaking phenomenal what
I usually do is I don't spray it on my
face I'll just like spray it on my
powder brush and then press it into my
skin I just laser
great flawless finished to my skin and
it does add a little bit of coverage as
well by the way these still have a good
bit of weight to them and I've been
using them all month really quickly just
went to my favorite camel of the month
it's been passion flower from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works I bought two of these when
they were out I don't know if they still
have them out now I know if all scents
are coming out and I totally missed the
tuber 20-episode set and health is I'm
kind of running low on candles again but
this was definitely my favorite candle
this is my second one I got The
Wallflowers of it and everything that
was is falling
it says juicy passionfruit watery pear
and cuffs a bond of Cabana
mm-hm melon combined perfectly with a
huge and vanilla - agent vanilla I
definitely smell pretty much all of that
pears passion fruit melon vanilla yep
that's that's right on right there now
moving on to more skin care products my
skin care has totally changed this month
actually changed about the last week of
last month and I've been sticking to it
and I am blown away from at the price
I've been using I love them I definitely
splurged in the beginning of the month
or the end of last month but I mean it's
so worth it first big investment I made
was buying a Clarisonic and I love this
thing I don't know what the color is
like sea breeze something I don't know I
got the Clarisonic Mia - it's amazing I
love the fact that it has like the timer
on it so I just know when the you know
move it around my skin super easy to use
use it every night if I miss a night and
I use it in the day I mean everything
everybody says about the Clarisonic you
know you never know how clean you get
your skin until you get the Clarisonic
it's all true I'm not even like to you
it is all completely true
you honestly never know how dirty your
skin is until you get one of these and
you can feel the difference like if I go
without using this I feel disgusting and
I'm not joking like it's I can't live
without this now and I can't not use it
it drives me nuts so this is definitely
one of the investments I made but it's
been the best investment for my skin to
use that I've been using my
charity this is the face watch I use I
honestly did not know what face wash to
use so every time I watched a Claire
sonet video because I watched like a ton
for I bought one everybody use this so
it's like maybe I should just use that
I've never used it before so this is the
one-step facial cleanser from philosophy
it's really great as well I definitely
recommend it another thing that I
purchased from philosophy is to take a
deep breath mister Iser it is an
oil-free energizing oxygen gel cream
moisturizer I love this I use it day and
night I have made a huge dent in this
bad boy it's really bright if you have
oily skin you having a hard time finding
you know good moisturizer I definitely
recommend this one it's awesome I was
using the Cetaphil old control
moisturizer for a very long time and
then you know the Senate bill is like 24
dollars in the drugstore so why not just
go and purchase a high-end one as well
that has you know pretty good benefits
so this has been really great for my
skin leaves it's super super soft and I
just enjoy it for day and night I'm
almost done it promised there was a lot
of new products so I'm almost done last
thing for her skin carrots for the body
it's the lush rose argon a body
conditioner I used to use this back in
the day and I had like a sample of it or
something and I recently went back to
purchase it because I loved it so much I
just never was around a lush and I love
this stuff it smells so good oh my god I
use it every day
and when I was at lunch the girl
actually told me that instead of rinsing
it off after you apply it she would
actually get out of the shower and Pat
her skin dry so that's what I've been
doing and I love it I feel like it's
even more moisturizing
I don't use a lotion after I get out of
the shower because this does the job and
whenever she told me she does pat
yourself dry I was like I wonder if that
would be okay so I just decided to try
and I've really been enjoying it I feel
like it keeps you much more moisturized
than just going ahead and rinsing it off
and getting out of the shower so I
recommend just apply
and then you know getting out of your
shower and then just patting yourself
dry even with it just still on your skin
and it'll leave you super super soft and
the smell just lingers I love it last
big prize I have for you our hair the
first one is a shampoo this is the big
sea salt shampoo and this is from lush
as well I got this because I heard it
was really great to make your hair more
volume eyes cuz this month I've been all
about you know big hair trying to get
there but this is a really great shampoo
I was honestly nervous about it because
of the sea salt part of it I thought
that is going to dry out my hair look
crazy
and I thought it wouldn't lab there very
well but surprisingly this lathers
amazingly only use it once a week
because it will dry out your hair if you
continue to use it like every single day
so I use it once a week and let me tell
you my hair will go quite a few days
without you know having to wash it
because there's like no oil up there
it's amazing I really like this it does
add a lot of body to my hair and it
makes me you're really soft last two are
from big sexy hair I did purchase these
and I know a lot of people were
wondering if I did or didn't in my
getting rainy morning routine video but
I did purchase them myself this one was
from hope like this one is from
Walgreens but I love it this one I used
to use a lot a few months ago and I
mention it in a favorites video it's the
big sexy hair root pump this is great if
you watched my boarding routine which I
will link down below you'll see how I
use both of these products so you can
check that out and then the other
favorite is the big sexy hair blow dry
volumizing gel and I've been loving this
so much so that is it for my favorites
for this month I hope you guys enjoyed

favorites were this month and also don't
