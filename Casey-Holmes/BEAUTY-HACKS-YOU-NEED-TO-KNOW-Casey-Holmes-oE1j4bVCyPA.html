bit cleaner so I hope you guys enjoyed

beauty hacks leave it in the comments
below I always love hearing some
different beauty hacks so thank you guys
so much for watching and let's just get
started with the video okay so this
first one is for if your brush is just
nasty and mine gets like this especially
if I use a lot of dry shampoo so I like
to take pure baking soda and lukewarm
water and I put about three or four
tablespoons in there mix it up and then
you just want to put your brush face
down in it let it soak overnight and
then you just want to let it air dry and
this really gets it nice and clean and
gets all of that dry shampoo out and
it's like a brand new brush so moving on
to a dry shampoo I love this this is
amazing I'm gonna add a Hershey's
unsweetened cocoa powder this just adds
a tint to it since I do have darker hair
and then of course I'm gonna add some
cornstarch to add it a little too much
so I put some back into the tin and then
you just want to mix it up and you
basically have a tinted dry shampoo and
cornstarch a lot of people have used for
a long time to use as a dry shampoo but
adding this hershey's unsweetened cocoa
powder just gives it a nice tint and it
also has a really great smell because it
smells like chocolate so this is great
if you have darker hair if you don't
have darker hair you obviously don't
have to add the Hershey's cocoa powder
I had just curled my hair and I needed
to put some dry shampoo in so the way I
use it is I put some of this into my
hand and then I tap it into my roots and
then I put it on the other areas where
I'm really oily which is this mainly at
the top of my head and then all you're
gonna want to do is wipe off your hands
and really rub in this product it does
have a little bit of residue but if you
rub it in really well and I didn't even
comb it out I just rubbed it in
and you were all set and it really does
make a huge difference and I honestly
don't think I'm gonna purchase dry
shampoo anymore because this smells like
chocolate so if you have a problem with
hair static all you have to do is take a
bounce to sheet and just run this over
your hair and go ahead and enjoy the
smell because we all know it smells
delicious
and I like this method for when I just
blow-dried my hair and any times like
that so if you're having a problem with
hair static just take one of these bad
boys and wipe it over your hair and
it'll take care of that right away so
this is for my girls with oily skin I
have this issue all the time and I
always forget about blotting sheets so
you can actually take coffee filters and
split them in half just like I'm about
to do right here and this is basically
like two blotting sheets in one so all
you're gonna do is press it up to your
skin and this just takes off the excess
oil so you don't have to put more powder
on top of your oil and look cakey so
this is perfect if you don't have time
to run out and get blotting sheets and
this is how dirty it was look at all
that oil crazy
okay so this one's where if you have a
problem with razor bumps I know I do I
get them really bad on the back of my
thighs especially there in the
wintertime so I like to take this
johnson's baby oil and this is a shea
butter cocoa one and I just love the way
it smells and then when I put this on I
put some pants on go to sleep and then
in the morning it is less red and just
so much better I love love that trick
and then if you run out of makeup
remover you can use Vaseline and my mom
used to do this all the time but you can
use this to take off your eye makeup or
your face makeup whichever one I
wouldn't recommend this for everyday but
it does the job and I love it too just
make sure you wash your face with your
regular cleanser and you'll be set and
it also love to use Vaseline on my heels
as you can see they get really dry it
might be a little nasty to you but it's
just real life problems and I'm just
gonna put it on my heels put some socks
on and then head to bed okay so that is
it for this beauty hacks video I hope
