a big appalled I went to the drugstores
knack Ulta and I think that's it I have
a few things to show you guys I'm really
excited to show you I'm actually want to
go through my makeup collection and get
over get rid of a lot of things that
because of I've noticed I've had some
stuff for a while and I'm pretty sure
it's expired something to go through my
whole mega collection clear this baby
out and reorganize and just do some deep
cleaning and I really wanted to
experiment with some new products so I
decided to go shopping and do that and I
have a lot of tutorials coming for you
guys so I wanted to kind of put it all
in here to break some things up I have a
lot coming for you so just stay tuned
for those um but we're gonna get started
with this called I'm gonna start with a
non drugstore stuff first the first
thing I want to talk about I actually
have a little story behind and I don't
know if I overreacted about this but I
got pissed off and it's very rare that
somebody pisses me off in retail to be
quite honest with you
so basically the story is I'm running
out of this and makeup brush cleanser
from Clinique right so you only have a
little bit left
I've repurchase this twice so I went to
the clinic counter in my Macy's because
it's right there where I parked whatever
and I went to the clinic counter and
this really sweet girl you know she was
helping me and I told her what I needed
he's just finding it on the Clinique
counter girl I guess the girl that I was
speaking with wasn't the girl that
worked at that counter she worked in a
different makeup counter and the girl
that worked at the Clinique counter was
with a customer and was like okay does
she need me she told the girl that was
helping me okay - she need me to show
her how to use this product and then the
girl came at me and I said no you know
I'm just purchasing it I just wanna you
know get it and go you know I've got
some Christmas shopping to do and she
went back to the girl and the girl was
like well I want to show her how to use
it before she's buys it and I'm like I
know how to use it like just just let me
buy the brush cleaner like is it that
big of a deal and the girls like well
she's with a customer she wants to speak
with you after she gets done with them
and I'm like you know what
I felt so bad for the girl that I was
dealing with because she was so sweet
but I was like you know what just forget
it
I'll go somewhere else because seriously
you're not gonna sell me a brush cleaner
because you want to show me how to use
it because you don't think I know how to
use it I don't know that was like my big
thing for the day so I went to Dillard's
because I was so pissed off I don't know
if I should have gotten that mad but I
was just like really irritated that
somebody pretty much denied me a
purchase because of their own mind I
guess I'm though so in the Dillards to
that Clinique and they were actually
sold out and lord knows I was not going
back to the one at Macy's so the girl
suggested this woman from Estee Lauder
it's being like a brush cleanser she
says basically the same things and it's
all pretty much the same company and so
yeah this one's a peak color as well and
this one has a spray so hopefully it's
the same thing I love this the spotclean
Bret wolf I love this one to spot clean
brushes and hopefully I love this one as
well but yeah that's my story for the
day I was so mad guys like I wasn't
completely rude to the girl I was just
like I'll go somewhere else but I've
never had someone just completely deny
me a purchase if you guys have ever had
that experience let me know because I
was a really irritated today
let's get positive though moving on to
Ulta I'm going to show you guys a few
things and then I got first off I got
two hair products I'll show you this
first this is a repurchase I purchased
the big size again of my matrix biologic
color lash shampoo I love this stuff I
told you guys that before I've had so
many questions on my hair especially on
Instagram I've had so many requests for
a like haircare routine because it's
really really shiny but obviously my
hair I feel like has always been shiny
but if you want to see a haircare
routine or anything like that then just
let me know in the comments because I do
have a few products that I like to use
and I would love to share with you guys
if you are interested in that so let me
know in the comments below if you want
to see it but this is definitely one of
my favorite products just as matrix
biologic and poo that you can't even see
cuz it's so water I also got this red
kin blonde idol I believe Nicole Pereira
Guerrero talked about this at her
November favorites but she uses the
purple one for more of a cool toned
blonde but for myself I like my blonde
to be a little bit more
warm side so this one is the adjustable
color depositing and daily treatment for
warmer golden blonds and it just has
like a thing where you can adjust it I
don't necessarily know a lot about this
product
I need to rewatch her favorites video
because I didn't need to remember what
she said about it but I'm obviously
doing for stuff just to kind of keep my
blonde nice and up-to-date and looking
fresh and not dull and I just redid mine
like a what a couple weeks ago so I just
want to kind of keep up with it more and
this was expensive like so expensive I
don't remember the price I'll put it
like an annotation somewhere but I
figured he'll why not try it because I
need to broaden my horizons with some
hair products moving on to the finer
items which is like a makeup and
accessories stuff so the first thing I
got was this NYX angel veil skin
perfecting primer I've heard great
things about this primer and I really
wanted to try it I didn't even try the
sample at the store I just picked this
up and went because it's Christmas time
and ain't Bou that wasn't runny and I'm
really not trying to stay there for
forever this is really really smooth so
I figured I would just go ahead and try
this baby out
heard great things about it so I'm
excited to try it and it's drugstore so
that's a plus something that's not too
interesting but I want to see if it's a
do before the beauty blender saw the
cleanser this is the japonesque solid
brush cleanser gentle goat-milk
cleansing balm and this is what it looks
like man these white products are just
not showing up on camera very well sorry
but what's even doing down here
basically it just to me I saw it and I
was like wait a minute what is that if
this is a dupe for the Beauty Blender
solid cleanser I'm gonna be pretty dang
excited because I don't look closer for
him so it takes me forever to like get
that stuff but this is what it looks
like if you can see it I'm sorry it's
hard to see on camera
dang that's a lot of product okay you
see how thick this is and it's filled up
it's a lot more product than the
immunity Blender small cleanser so I'm
gonna use this stuff tonight and let you
guys know what I think of it as soon as
possible because it's
interesting I haven't seen anything like
this other than the Beautyblender ones
so I'm really excited about that also I
did get another torch eyelash curler
nothing too interesting I just needed a
new one because mine's not really
curling as well so had to repurchase
that I also purchased this Tarte
Amazonian clay waterproof concealer in
medium I just wanted to try to concealer
I have been in Mac Pro Longwear lover
and dedicate erson al and I just wanted
to try something new so I got this one
because I've never tried this one before
and it seems really nice and smooth
that's the color right there I think I'm
gonna like it underneath the eyes so it
seems like it's really high coverage and
I do like the packaging of this that
it's a stick form so it's gonna be easy
to apply and yeah I'm excited to give
this let me go I also a gotten the NYX
HD concealer because I tried this a long
time ago I hated it
oh I hated it but I'm like I said I'm
trying to find like new concealers to
try and I figured why not give this one
to go one last time before I just
completely say no I hate it this one's
in the color cwo for beige that's it
right there it's super opaque and just
intense this one is a little bit more of
a yellow undertone to it and I think I'm
gonna like it I just have to give it
another try it looks like it's gonna be
really nice but you know how you try
products you hate them and then you try
them again you end up loving them later
on so we'll see if I can end up loving
this and then that's actually all I got
from Ulta now moving on to Mac Mac is
just one of those places that I get
suckered into every time so first off I
got another pump for my and Mac or my
Estee Lauder foundations these are the
pumps that they used for my Estee Lauder
foundations so whenever you see this on
this little guy it's from Mac I love
them I repurchase two more SLR don't
work on Asians so I needed another one
of the pumps and then for new
foundations I did get the Mac Studio
sculpt foundation SPF 15 I don't
necessarily know how I'm gonna love
these and I'm in two colors because
I feel like I have the hardest time
finding my perfect shade in Mack so I
got the color NC 42 for when I'm nice
and self tan because if you guys been
watching my some of my videos recently
you've seen my self tanner it's just so
dark I've been having a hard time
getting a darker foundation to match it
so I can see 42 and it also got NW 40
just to see which one's gonna match
better what tone will be better with the
self tanner because right now I'm in a
tough spot and I can't figure out which
one I like better I just wanted to try
new foundations with this self tanner
and the Estee Lauder one like I know
what colors I am but with stuff like
this I don't know and I've heard amazing
things about this foundation so I'm
really excited to try it and then I just
got some oh I did get one more thing
from Ulta I just found this this the arm
stuff yeah dip brow pomade I got the
color soft brown and probably last much
longer to try this product but again I
just wanted to try something new so that
soft brown I figured I would go with
something a little bit lighter like this
because I liked more on the lighter
brown since I have lighter ends so we'll
see how I like I've heard some good and
bad things about it and you know I'll
let you know I'm gonna think about it oh
by the way excuse the clothes back there
it's called getting ready you know if
you're a girl you understand it it's
hard got three new eyeshadows ones a
crank pressed pigment and then two other
ones are pro longwear eyeshadows this
one I'm so excited to use because I
think it is beautiful i swatched it and
I was like yes yes yes and yes I've been
using this and sweet actually
this is the matte pressed pigment in
light touch this is so stunning if the
camera of course is not doing it any
justice but that's what it looks like
right there it's like a beautiful shade
this would well the tester was alive the
tester was a lot more creamy than this
one hmm
it's not coming off to me as creamy as
the tester was I'm gonna have to play
with this a little bit and see how I
like it but to me the tester was just a
lot more
creamy and smooth this one I'm having to
dig my finger and so definitely gonna
keep the receipt just in case I don't
like that and then I got two Pro
Longwear eyeshadows that this one's more
cool toned it's called fashion fix and I
like these polymer shadows because
they're really big and from what I could
tell they have a really awesome pigment
so again this one is in the color
fashion fix beautiful cool tone gray
shade love this love this love this love
this so creamy smooth the best gray I
have in my collection of by far so
beautiful this one I was like if there's
a color that is my color I don't say
this all the time but if there is an
eyeshadow that is my kind of color it is
this one this is in the color
uninterrupted again another Pro Longwear
eyeshadow
oh my gosh it's so ready it's like a
mustardy mid-tone Brown ooh oh my gosh
you guys like I can't I can't with this
color it is so insanely beautiful creamy
blends so well that's it right there
I love this shade oh my god it is so
pretty so if you build it up it looks a
little bit like that a little bit more
dark but if you kind of do a light wash
it has more of that mustard tone to it
and I love this so pretty
okay now we're gonna go ahead and move
on the drugstore so the first place
we're gonna talk about is CVS and my
students never really has like all the
new fun drugstore items out so but it's
usually the first place I go so I really
don't know but the first thing I got is
this Maybelline lash sensational very
black mascara
it just looked interesting to me and I
wanted to try it so I got this mascara
in a very good I got some razors so then
the next thing I got from CVS I have two
things I got another mascara this is the
Rimmel London extreme of black wonder
lash
and it says clump free volume and
definition formula with argan oil so
excited to try this out I don't really
know what the argan oil would do for
your lashes I guess just conditioned
them but interesting and well I'll try
new things and then I got this covergirl
ultra smooth foundation and applicator
and I got it in soft honey so this is
what it looks like if you can see I
don't really know where the applicator
is felt like I couldn't see it like I
didn't get an applicator oh here it is
umm I am NOT applying my foundation with
it no ma'am it's like a silicone thing
but I figured why not try something new
it's been hard for me to find a jokes or
foundation that I really love and then
if you guys follow me on snapchat you
saw me when I hit the jackpot at
Walgreens which is where I will be going
from now on for a drugstore items so the
first thing I got I'm really excited
about it's the Revlon Photoready
airbrush effect makeup and golden beige
has a pump which is really exciting
let's see this shade I did I didn't test
this out in Spore so it's not really a
runny consistency but this color looks
much better like for when I'm nice and
soft and that one looks like it's gonna
be much better so I'm excited to try
this one out revlon usually has pretty
good foundations so that's exciting I
want to do like a a few I'm gonna do
more looks with the drugstore part so
they know I do a lot with just high-end
products and then I just got this brow
stylist plumper for medium to dark hairs
and it's just a brow gel mascara so I
figured I'll try it out because I like
trying new brow gels and I even like to
try them by themselves just to see if
they're kind of like the benefit gimme
brow where they'll kind of fill in your
browsing you don't have to do like a
full on brow routine for the day and
love those because they saved my life
another mascara I've got the covergirl
full lash bloom mascara and very black
covergirl does have really great
mascaras the lash blast is one
favorites so I figured I would give this
want to go kind of the same packaging if
you guys like I kind of want to start
doing first impressions on things again
so if you guys want to see first
impressions on anything then please let
me know in the comments below
oh I got this Revlon Photoready
insta-fix which is a makeup foundation
touch your upper basically and this is
what it looks like I got it in the same
color didn't I yes I got in the same
color golden beige I just think this is
really nifty like if your foundation
just kind of blots off you could just
touch up with this and dab it in and be
good to go oh I'm really excited up
these that looked really different in
store I thought this was more of a nude
but these are the Rimmel London probe
eclipse provoke lips ooh kiss proof lip
color 16 hour wear and I really just
want to see the colors but I haven't
watched them at all
so this one's in the color 730 make your
move that you're supposed to do this
side first and then the kissable side on
the other so oh whoo I take back what
I've said I'm actually well no look how
sheer that is I won't if you can build
that up I won't if it dries matte all
rights a little bit sheer as you can see
you can kinda see my skin in the middle
of that but if that would dry matte that
would be absolutely amazing and then the
other side is just I'm guessing and
gloss it's like a gel texture but it is
clear you can't really see it much right
there so I want this to draw on my hand
because I want to see if it drives now
but if this charge matte that is a
gorgeous color and then this one's in
the shade kiss fatal 2:30 and oh I
didn't know this one had a little bit
glitter in it
oh yes this is actually if this dries
matte this would be a great dupe for
Lolita
I feel like oh that is pretty I'm moving
on I did get this Revlon and mapped Kohl
this is Yves photo-ready
matte i pencil and yeah I got it Matt
Cole it says built-in smudge
cool um I'm always looking for a new
eyeliners and things to try out so sue
that's black look at how black that is
dang that was intense dude there's no
skin showing in that black Wow that is
intense then I have two more paisa
murder with this video I have this
L'Oreal oh no I'm sorry
this is covergirl trublend liquid makeup
and d2 cuz again I'm trying to find some
different foundations especially at the
drugstore so figured I would give it
this one a try and then I also got this
as was new as well the l'oreal
infallible 14 hour wear black smoke
powder eyeliner pin this was just
interesting to me I just I don't know
something about it was just like hey you
need to try that so what it looks like
oh it's like a matte packaging and that
is I love matte black that's oh wow this
big that's a huge tip I did not expect
it to be that big I have to play with it
but it has good color payoff to be a
powder liner it's not bad it's not like
chocolate chalky or anything like that
so we'll see how it like that that's it
right there it's actually kind of nice
it would be a nice base for a smoky eye
or something I forgot to show you guys
this it's all on the floor just like one
of the most exciting things that I found
at Ulta because I'm gonna use this for
one of my new year's eve and makeup
tutorials this is the Urban Decay
eyeshadow in a moon dust I know I'm
gonna lay down these eyeshadows but I
don't know I guess it's just because
