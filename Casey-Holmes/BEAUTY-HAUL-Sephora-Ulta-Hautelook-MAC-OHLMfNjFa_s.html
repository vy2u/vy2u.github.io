a beauty haul I purchased quite a bit of
stuff the past couple weeks and I
figured I would show you what I
purchased so I'm just gonna hang it
sorry because I have like a mountain
over here and it's ridiculous so I'm
ready to put this stuff up and I had to
film this video like today but the first
thing I want to show you guys is right
here and these are my Muji drawers I got
them online I'll put these sites down
below but they're basically five drawers
and I just stack them on top of each
other things like paint pots this size
they will not fit inside the drawers but
things like the Maybelline Color tattoos
these will fit perfectly inside the
drawer so they are a little bit more
tiny but I really like them I just like
the layout that it gives and it's just
really pretty and sleek it's probably my
best purchase I've made so the pink
drawers are gone and the white drawers
are also gone that were right beside my
vanity basically I've made my makeup fit
in this if it hasn't fit I've given it
to my cousin now I'm putting more stuff
in so I'm gonna have to really find some
room but I might do an update a little
tiny makeup collection on my blog tail
not too sure yet but if I do it will be
in my vlog channel so check that out
down below and don't forget to go and
subscribe anyways I'm gonna go ahead and
get started with hautelook admission
hook look a lot of times in my videos
link will be down below as always but
it's basically a flash sale sites are
things I'm going to show you now they
are not on there anymore they basically
come through once in a while for about
three days and then they're off the site
so you just have to keep paying
attention to the website to see when all
the good sales are going on I saw big
sexy hair was on there so I decided to
get some things I got the big sexy hair
root pump because I've seen Ashley was
just a late sander she's used this a lot
in her videos and I was really
interested in it I also got the straight
sexy hair anti frizz and shine spray
I've actually used it a couple times
it's really nice and it smells really
good so I'm liking this product so far
also the bomb was on HauteLook again and
I decided to purchase a couple things I
got to foundations just in different
colors this is a time bomb the bomb
foundation I
in light medium and medium basically it
looks just like the concealer in a
bigger jar so that's what it looks like
I haven't tried these out or anything
either but it comes with a little sponge
and the product on the inside so I'm
very excited to try these out I love the
concealer I should have got another
lighter one when it was on there but I
love the concealer so hopefully I'll
love these foundations as well and then
I also got two more blushes and their
packaging is so cute on their blushes
and the first one is down boy this one's
just a mommy kind of pink color this is
really really beautiful and then there's
the packaging it's just so cute how can
you not love their packaging and this
one's down boy right there if you can
see the next one is frat boy these are
just too cute I love them and this is
more of a coral color I know a lot of
people have talked about this before and
I finally decide to get it so that's
what frat boy looks like very very
pretty and it is actually the second one
right there these colors are these
blushes are very very pigmented you can
use them as blushes shadow whatever you
want to use so I thought that's awesome
and then Laura Geller was also on
HauteLook so I just picked up a couple
things the first one I got is this lip
strip which is basically a lip scrub and
it's just plain old simple one this one
smells like mint so it's sort of a minty
lip scrub and I'm excited to try it I've
never had a lip scrub before so I
thought I'd just go ahead and pick one
up and then the last thing I have
purchased from hautelook that's came in
so far I've been purchasing so many
things off hautelook it's crazy but on
the last thing I got is this baked cheek
color some more Geller and this isn't
sun-swept
and these are huge blushes they're
definitely worth the money but this is
what it looks like it's just the most
gorgeous blush ever I feel like this is
a year-round color it's just beautiful
so that's it right there I love it it's
so pretty and then this also came with
like a little retractable brush which is
just a plain old retractable brush a lot
nicer than drugstore ones
so I'm excited to kind of keep this in
my purse next I will show you things
that I got from Mac the first thing is a
Mac brush cleanser and I've already put
some of it in this little bottle that I
got from CVS but I just got this for
basically spot cleaning eyeshadow
brushes and stuff like that because you
guys know I hate cleaning my brushes and
so I thought I pick this up just a spot
clean and then I also picked up with two
pigment sets either from the guilty
passions collection this one's the four
brilliantly cool crushed metallic
pigments and they're more like the blue
kind of teal colors they're really
really really gorgeous and then I also
got the tenderly warm crushed metallic
pigments and they're basically like your
little neutral colors and stuff I love
them I'm still kind of having a hard
time with them I feel like they're a
little bit difficult to work with if you
have these and kind of know of a good
way to apply them didn't just let me
know down below because I'm kind of
having a hard time with them but next is
Sephora so they had a little deal where
you could get this little black bag with
a bunch of samples and it came with
something like the Urban Decay
brightening primer the DDF serum don't
know what that is and like it came with
a bunch of different stuff in here so I
thought that was really cool support
always has like cute little things going
on and then I also got my birthday gift
because I did order in November or after
November and if the fresh shirt because
it's mini lip duo I've tried the clear
one and I like it but it's not something
I'd spend $20 on you know I'm not
spending that much on chapstick so but
it's nice to get just for free um so
from its the full rub the first thing I
got is the Beauty Blender I have been
wanting this so bad and I finally picked
it up if you would like a first
impressions on this and please let me
know like ASAP because I'm so ready to
open this bad boy and use it it's just
oh I've been wanting it for so long and
I finally just decided to splurge on it
so I did pick this up very very excited
to use it I got the one with just the
one Beauty Blender and the cleanser and
then I got another little gift set this
is from soap &amp;amp; Glory so it just comes in
this
you a little like travel I don't know
like things you could put your shower
and it's really cute though and it comes
with this isn't like 25 dollars to clean
on me creamy moisturizing shower gel and
the hand food hydrating hand cream which
I know people talk about this product
all the time so I was really excited to
try that out and then I didn't know the
can with a full sized body butter but it
did this is 10.1 fluid ounces which is
crazy it's the very dry skin formula and
it's the righteous butter so it says it
has softening shea butter aloe vera and
yeah the rest of its like in French or
something but that's what it looks like
it's a huge jar totally huge and it
smells delish so I can't wait to try
that out and then the rest of the stuff
I got from Sephora is just from makeup
forever I picked up another matte velvet
plus foundation in number 30 so now I
have 40 35 and 30 of this foundation and
I think those three colors will last me
for a while but I felt the difference
between this one and the other ones I
have and the other ones are a lot wider
so I have a feeling I'm gonna have to
repurchase another one pretty soon I
also got this Makeup Forever aqua seal
this basically makes your eye makeup
waterproof whether you want it to be
your liner your eyeshadow anything like
that
it's just like this little bottle of the
little liquid and it and I'm gonna have
to experiment more with it I haven't
tried it at all yet but I used to use
something like this back in the day I
forget who it was from but I used to see
something like this back in the day and
I really really liked it I also got the
makeup forever duo matte powder which
just looks like this I think I've got
mine in transparent bags which is 202
comes with a little puff on the inside
and it's just a really nice powder I'm
loving that so far then I got a hollow
DM powder which this is just a gorgeous
like glitter pigment oh my gosh it's
like the finest glitter ever it's so
beautiful I got mine in 303 I wanted the
plum color too but they are sold out and
they are not
getting that baby back but these are
limited-edition so I recommend picking
it up like ASAP but this is the color
hopefully it'll focus ah you can't see
the light gorgeousness of this color it
is so beautiful there you go there's a
little bit of it I mean it's just the
most gorgeous color I've ever seen you
can use this as a highlight or you can
use it on your eyes for eyeshadow it's
beautiful and I'm definitely gonna have
to do in New Year's I look with this
because it's just gorgeous
so we went to the salon Colton went to
get his hair done and I was of course
looking at you know all the little
shampoos and stuff so I ended up buying
this biological and conditioner this is
the color Kerr one I like it but I kind
of feel like it drives my hair up a
little bit if you use this brain let me
know what your favorite one is but I
really love the smell and I actually
really like them I just kept it like it
dries it out a little bit that shampoo
and conditioner over $22 and you got a
free little oil so this is the exquisite
oil the replenishing treatment so just
got that for free with it and then the
last place is Ulta and I just are it's
not the last place but I got in
macadamia deeper pear mask so far I'm
liking it but I don't see why it's $30 I
don't think it's worth the 30 but it's
nice so I'm still kind of just trying
that out and then I also picked up the
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I've
been eyeing this for forever and I just
decided to pick it up it does smell just
like milk chocolate so I'm loving that -
it's really pretty and then the last
thing from Ulta I got the NYX the curved
eyeliner I was really interested in this
and I just want to go ahead and pick it
up so I just got one of those and then
the last things I got are two more Z
palettes if you were interested in
seeing a departing video then just like
this video and I will do that for you
but I just got two extra ones so now I
have three Z palettes I love these
things I think they're great
so that is all I got in my beauty haul I
hope you guys enjoy this thank you so
much for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
