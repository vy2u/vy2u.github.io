how I get big messy curls these are just
definitely they're not put together
they're kind of messy and all over the
place and I really like these curls for
spring and summer because most of you
know I do a lot of beachy type hair
tutorials because that's my favorite
type of hair and this hairstyle it's
really great once you've slept on it and
you wake up you know those second day
curls half the time they look better
than the first time you curled your hair
so I really like the way these look for
second day they just look very wavy and
gorgeous I do have a coupon code that
I'll be using meaning we crawl on the
coupon code be down below for you to get
I think it's 110 dollars off so you can
check that below but if you want to see
how I get these big messy curls and just
people do the first thing like I said
section in the two parts and I take kind
of thicker sections with this one
because sometimes since curls can be
really tight with this and I don't
really like super tight curls so I try
to take a nice chunk yeah
I'd say about that much inch to an inch
and a half kind of strand I'm gonna take
this one behind my head and I'm just
going to wrap my hair around it nothing
specific or anything you just want to
make sure you wrap it all the way around
you just hold it there for a little bit
you don't have to hold it there for long
at all because this one is super super
hot and let it down and you get like
these really cute kind of messy waves so
I'm going to toss that to the back going
up to the top stone I'm going to take
another big piece wrap this around strap
it around and I don't like to take it
all the way to my root because I do kind
of want it a little bit flatter on top I
guess then again just let it down
there's kind of roll it back off and
really pretty crow now sometimes I'll go
through after I'm done and like touch up
certain spots if it's too flat so we'll
see how it turns out
so after you've kind of curled your hair
with this I would definitely go through
and see if there's any pieces you know
you don't like then of course this part
right here um there's a lot shorter than
the rest of my hair and my babies are
really short too they're kind of like
the same length so I like take a
straightener to them and just curl them
out myself
cuz usually I don't like the way curling
irons call my bangs unless they're
longer but I just got my haircut the
other day so now they're like really
short I love the way my hair turns out
that's probably why it's really big
messy curls and I love that especially
for spring and summer because I don't
always like to have super pretty put
together curls sometimes just wanted
messy so I can sleep in it in the next
day it also looks really great as well
so this is great second day hair also
because it falls and like throughout the
day it's just gonna look really nice so
yes I hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you have this curling iron let me
know how you like it and keep a lookout
for spring makeup tutorial I'll be
putting them very soon so yes thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
