I'm going to be showing you how to get
this makeup look it's pretty easy and
simple but will have a twist on this
video because my boyfriend is going to
be doing my voiceover I thought you
didn't know talking on this video I can
do an intro you guys requested this
video so much on my social media so I
hope you guys enjoy this video if you do
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel and also leave
some comments down below letting me know
what videos you want to see next in the
month of December and yeah I hope you
enjoy it and let's get started with this
boyfriend does my voiceover slash
hopefully makeup tutorial slash we added
one more twist he's maybe a little bit
drunk so let's get started here we're
gonna add a little bit of eye stuff to
make my eyes ready to go and then we're
gonna tape him up so we add the lines
and we're not gonna go outside those
lines so we're gonna brush in some skin
colored stuff to make a good foundation
and then we're gonna brush in some other
skins huh yeah so we're going to brush
in some other skin colored stuff but a
little darker on the outsides so you'll
notice here we're going to go dark on
the outside and we're going to move
closer to the inside but with lighter
colors it's a really good smokey look
arm the transition is what it's all
about
and you know it's just like a look that
you got to go for if you're trying to
say hey I'm ready to party but I'm also
independent you know I'm saying okay so
let's move on to my glitter the glitter
is like the extra bling that you got to
show when you're out and about and you
need people to know go Tigers
he knows what I'm about so the glitter
look you know we all know it glitters
about so let's move on so I'm going to
put a really light shade on the inside
of my eyes and what this is going to do
is reflect the light in a certain way to
make
you look really fierce you gotta look
fierce that's all about the wing and the
smokiness and just parts of the eye look
that every woman needs to go for so let
me just finish this up real quick and I
should be done here in a minute
hopefully because really fast my makeup
at least that's what David says not
really but okay I'm gonna just do some
eyeliner here so we moved on past the
eye shadow and I'm gonna i line my eyes
yeah I'm gonna i line my eyes here and
I'm done doing that now so we're gonna
prime and look at the line that I
created with that tape that is
perfection
so let's moisturize all right we're
going to moisturize on the forehead and
the cheeks and the nose and then I'm
going to put this shucks stuff on my
face with my teardrop brush and I'm
gonna do the lower half of my face under
my eyes my temples my forehead my
hairline my eyebrow my nose my other
tipple and yeah yeah yeah oh wait oh
there's more so here we go with the
a physical concealer and we're going to
conceal in the triangle formation here
under the eyes and the tip of the nose
and the lip of the brow and the peak of
the forehead and the crest of my chin so
that we highlight all of the high areas
of my face and we do a really good job
of contouring so then we you gotta bake
it okay you have to bake with powder and
what powder does is it gets in there and
it makes it not so liquidy so now that
I'm baked
and I've got my clean slate I'm gonna
bronze it's like a tanning bed but
better because it takes two minutes and
then we're gonna fill in our brows here
with brow filler duh and then so I'm
going going going
got a comum and brush them and fill them
all at the same time you got to square
them off make them look good and then
really finish them all for the sleek
mascara brush thing and then brush we
brush we brush off the powder we finish
the bake and then you got to get under
the eyes the nose the chin and then we
blush and then you blush the top of your
forehead because if you don't blush the
top of your forehead did you really even
blush so yeah anyways let's contour now
contouring you know it's like kind of it
is really important and we all know why
so there's really no need to explain it
so let's just everyone hit the I believe
button
you got a contour so do your contouring
and put on the eyelashes it is like the
keys to success right there so let me
put on my eyelashes haters will say
they're fake but they're not so let me
just finish pinching them on and once
once they're on that are good to go so
now almost done with this look
people I'm gonna blush some more and
this is just like to give my rosy
youthfulness a highlight you know
I've gotta say hey here's my highlighter
and what we do with this highlighter is
we really accentuate the high parts of
my face that I want to stick out it's
like Bible verses in Sunday school you
highlight the important ones my
cheekbones are super important so look
at them now because they're highlighted
and that's that so then when we finish
off this look with the penciling of our
under lid and be careful with this
ladies you really don't want to poke
yourself in the eyes okay that's just
not good for anyone and then last but
not least are the lips we got to draw
the lines and then color inside them I
say again we got to draw the lines and
color inside them this is easy stuff we
learned it in first grade
watch and learn if you don't know how
I'm really good at it I finish this look
by drawing inside the lines
I've used my cream lipstick here it's
kind of like a lip stain but it's not
it's like a lip cream so I'm just going
to do it and then slow motion slow
motion for you moving slow motion for
you I'm going to look down my lashes are
banging and that's it guys thanks for
watching I hope you enjoyed click
