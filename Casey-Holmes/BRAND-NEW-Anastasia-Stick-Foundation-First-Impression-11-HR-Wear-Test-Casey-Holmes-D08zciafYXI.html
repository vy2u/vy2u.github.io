all about the new honest Asya stick
foundations and now supposedly these are
supposed to be really good for oily skin
so once I saw that on their Instagram
the moment that these went live I was
like they had a good color chart but I
was still kind of like oh I don't know
which one I'm gonna be just because I
have a hard time picking colors online
but I am so excited to try this out I
dig it two shades the shades honey and
caramel I feel like they look a darker
on these little swatches than they
actually look so what it says is that
it's a highly pigmented buildable cream
foundation stick with a natural matte
finish ideal for normal to oily skin
types so I'm so excited to try this out
I hope it's good we're going to do a
full day of where it is 1227 right now
we're going to apply it we're going to
apply it with a brush and with Beauty
Blender and we're just going to see how
it looks and if it's really good for
oily skin so let's just see this is what
the packaging looks like I love
Augusta's Xia's packaging it's all
pretty similar which I like and it's
really simple these are what these stick
foundations look like with her logo at
the top and then the shades on the
bottom so this one is the shade honey
hopefully these match me if not we got
to get some concealer so this is caramel
this is honey I think caramel is gonna
be more for me I think honey is a little
too warm it looks like it's gonna match
me best I'm going to prime my face like
I normally do I choose a Smashbox primer
water in the cane and Austin mattifying
primer this is so amazing if you have
large pores and you can see I'm kind of
breaking out right now I've been using a
new skin care product it's the folio
cleansing thingy I don't know what it's
called um I've been trying that out I
think that's what's breaking me out it's
like really getting deep into my skin
and I've been trying new masks so I feel
like my skin is kind of going through a
moment right now but again I am going in
with this cane and Austin primer this
really smooths out the skin fills in
your pores and it gives a nice matte
finish but it's not a drying formula
whatsoever which I enjoy I love
mattifying primers but I can't stand it
when they're overly drying and they just
like suck the life out of your skin by
the way I don't mind my brow I really
need to stop picking my eyebrows I have
this really bad habit of like pulling
out my eyebrow hair
and pulling out my hair in the back like
on the crown of my head I have to stop
doing it let me know if you have that
problem like do you pick out your hair
it's terrible I know I know okay so this
side of my face I'm gonna do it with a
Beauty Blender again this is in the
shade caramel I'm just going to not sure
how much I should put on blend it out
blending out really easily and it
doesn't feel it doesn't feel like I have
anything on my skin right off the bat
we're going to see how buildable this is
I didn't watch too many of their
Instagram videos to see how I should
apply it or anything like that I just
saw when it went live and I like went
over and went on the site and snatched
it so I don't know what the correct way
to apply it is the by link to kind of
just try things out with trial and error
set is one layer right there I think it
looks really pretty it doesn't look like
there's anything on the skin honestly it
just kind of sucked sucked just kind of
sunk into the skin and looks really
natural I'm going to try to build up a
little bit here on my redness or my nose
I love sick foundations because they're
just so easy but it's so hard to find a
go on for oily skin
I have a feeling I'm gonna like this
foundation a little bit better with a
brush but we will see it's very easy to
blend out with a beauty blender usually
things like this aren't that easy to
blend out with a beauty blender just
because they have a thicker formula whoo
and it's like set already to like a
velvety finish
ooh that feels so good doesn't feel
sticky at all and for brush I mentioned
this in my luxury makeup hub I'm gonna
use this today this is the de corte I
dunno the foundation brush I love this
little thing blends out foundation so
well and it's really quick and easy so
yeah go to town the neck my neck is so
light feel like this brush is blending
it out really well it's super fast
this has really great coverage and it
looks like skin I'm really liking it so
far and it covered up nose redness like
a boss you guys know it's like the true
test for me I look like I have a bib it
looks like a dewy finish on camera but
it doesn't feel like a dewy finish you
I'm saying I feel like I like it a
little bit better with the brush at
least this brush is so easy to blend it
out I think with any brush though it's
gonna be a lot easier to blend it out
and it looks really good on the skin it
just kind of looks like skin and it's so
lightweight like you can't feel it at
all it's amazing and it has that velvety
finish it just feels like nothing's on
your skin which is so crazy
I'm gonna go ahead and finish the rest
of my face makeup and I'll be back to
give you guys another update hey guys so
I'm back I finished the rest of my face
makeup and I'm going to quickly share
with you what I have on my face just
because I don't have a full glam makeup
going on so basically I just have this
girl on a terra cotta bronzer i showed
this in my really luxury makeup haul i
use this as i shadow my contour and my
bronzer i used the tarte risque blush i
know so you're probably sick of seeing
this because I've been using it non-stop
but I'm so obsessed with it and then for
highlighter I'm obsessed with this
palette that makeup geek and
kathleenlights collaborated to make and
you can see I love this gold shade so
this is the one that I have on my face
right now it's such a beautiful formula
I'm wearing this huda beauty liquid
matte lipstick and this is in the shade
spiced Grillo and for concealer I'm
wearing my newest favorite I think it's
beautiful so Smashbox Studios skin
24-hour waterproof concealer and when I
put this on top of the foundation it
blended so well just all the products
that I put on my face after the
foundation blended so well my face let
me make sure there's no eyeliner on my
hands my face feels so soft the kind of
soft that your boyfriend could put his
hand on your face and not be like one is
that it doesn't accentuate my pores and
it feels so good I just I'm going to say
that a thousand bazillion times I'm not
even kidding in this video I'm really
excited to wear it throughout the day
hopefully it holds up really well and
there's not too much blinding going on
so yeah let's just go ahead and take
this baby throughout the day it's kind
of early it is 118 it's not that early
but compared to other update videos I've
done this is the earliest time I think
I've done in such a long time so I'm
going to give you a quick little rundown
about this it is $25.00 it's vegan and
there is 0.32 ounces in this product
let's just roll it up and see how much
is in here that's not bad that's quite a
lot of product for a stick foundation to
have a freaking ton as you can see right
there so gonna go ahead and wear this
throughout the day and I will see you
guys in just a couple outfit guys so it
is 652 I wanted to give you an update on
this foundation and I'm gonna do it
right here because we have some natural
light coming in and this is this is rose
if you don't follow me then my name is
rose but I wanted to give you guys an
update on this foundation and I am
really loving it I don't know what it
was but it was so freaking hot I guess
because I normally like don't go out in
the day during that time I was freaking
so hot it was blazing I was sweating and
I was like great this foundation is
really having to take a test because I
was sweating so much that that's why my
hair is up and everything but this
foundation is holding up really well
I've only powdered once it's such a
lightweight product like I can't even
feel it even when I was sweating that's
very rude I'm trying to do a video even
when I was sweating like it didn't feel
like it was running off my face and it
didn't feel like it was super thick you
know sometimes when you start getting
sweaty and your oils start going through
the foundation it gets really thick and
you can just feel right here even after
I was sweating putting their groceries
in my car and taking them out and
everything I haven't blotted since then
I blot it before I went inside to
grocery shop and I was outside majority
of the time and loading everything
putting waters up on the outside and all
that kind of stuff it looks really nice
for me to have not put more powder on
after I went through like a sweat storm
so that's pretty impressive
and I just I love the way that it feels
Davis complimented me on my foundation
we were facetiming which was nice I did
take my lip car off because I wasn't
feeling it I had to keep touching it up
so I just ended up taking it off and
making some dinner but yeah again it is
only 655 but so far so damn good I'm
really impressed by it so yeah I will
see you guys in just a little bit hey
guys so it's the end of the night I'm
looking like a complete crazy person my
hair up you know because it was just way
too hot today but I'm finally ready to
go to bed take this makeup off I have
had this makeup on forever and I'm ready
to give you an update and let you know
and my thoughts on this foundation so
you can see right now that I do have a
little bit of shine to my skin but
honestly I think what's really bringing
that out a lot is the big-ass lights
that are right in front of me when you
have super harsh lights like this on you
everything is going to show up honestly
it's not that shiny because I have not
touched up at all since the first time I
touched up before I went grocery
shopping which I told you guys earlier
I've not put any powder to my face
anything like that this is literally
just the foundation and I am so
impressed by it I mean this is a really
great foundation again it feels so good
sometimes by the end of the night I
start feeling really gross right here by
my nose and on my cheeks and I can just
feel the oils coming through and I can
just feel the foundation like wanting to
dunk up right in this area and that's
what I know like it's time to take this
makeup off
I could literally wear this for hours
and hours and hours from now I mean it
just feels so good on the skin it
doesn't feel like you're wearing makeup
whatsoever I give this foundation
literally a 10 out of 10 and that
doesn't happen very often like it better
be a really good product to be a 10 out
of 10 and that is what this is I just am
obsessed with it is so freaking good so
I hope you guys enjoy this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you did
