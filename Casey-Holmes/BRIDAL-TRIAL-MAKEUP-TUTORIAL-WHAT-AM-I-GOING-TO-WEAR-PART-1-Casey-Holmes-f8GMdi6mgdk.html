today I'm going to show you guys this
makeup look which is one of the
contenders for my Bridal makeup look so
many holidays like my Bridal trial
makeup look just to try to get out
together and you can kind of go along
with me and if you like the look you can
use it for your wedding and we're just
going to see you know the different
options that we have and try different
products throughout these videos until
my wedding is here I think I'm going to
do like a total of 3 definitely 2 maybe
a total of 3 I have this one right here
which incorporates more color which I
really enjoy these are actually kind of
like similar to my wedding colors I
didn't even mean to do that I just like
happen so obviously I really like the
color but I wanted something a little
bit different not so traditional Bridal
makeup I know a lot more people like to
go towards like natural neutral side of
things which I do too bro don't worry I
do too but I wanted to try something
different for this video and I really
like the way that this turned out this
is definitely like one of those like top
makeup looks that I will probably do
just think it looks so pretty and so
feminine and just something a little bit
different don't forget to subscribe
before you leave and give this video a
thumbs up before more Bridal looks and
you know let's just go ahead and get
started okay so the first thing we're
going to do is prime I've been really
loving this Smashbox lid primer a lot of
these things in this video you're going
to see is stuff that I really love and
I'm just going to combine a lot of
things that I love and see where like
that the one thing I'm kind of going
back and forth with right now is
foundations I don't know what foundation
I want to wear I wish I could wear it a
lot or double wear but it does have
really bad flashback and now I'm going
to try to mix it today with a different
foundation and we will see how it looks
I love this Smashbox the photo lid
primer I think it's great you definitely
do need to set it it is a little bit
sticky after you apply it but it does
keep your eyeshadows on all day and it
creates a nice base for you to work with
the next thing I'm going to do is apply
tape you have enough I love using tape
it's just so easy for me to just align
this on the outer half of my eye to
create that a nice sharp line and this
really helps lift my eyes I do have more
like droopy eyes
I like to annual it up so that way my
eyeshadow angles up and it makes your
eyes was more lifted and more awake
instead of just like down in Jersey
especially if you're going to be using
darker shades on your outer corner which
we are going to be doing today
it is going to just have that to lift it
all up and apply this make sure we
haven't in my even they don't have to be
perfect but they gotta be somewhat even
all right and so now I'm going to do I'm
going to go on with this Tarte palette
and I'm using this Tarte clay play
palette and I will also be using a
Natasha bit on a star palette so the
first thing I do is go into the Tarte
wood and I'm going to take this shade
right here and set my entire lid just so
we left down that primer and nothing
creases nothing moves and nothing looks
choppy sometimes if your primer is
sticky it will then get a little choppy
and not be easy to blend so now we're
all using oxygen on a star palette or
shade I will be taking is this one right
here this is the shade flesh and I'm
going to be throwing that into the
crease so I have two different looks
that I'm going for and today I'm doing a
little bit more of a dramatic one for
you so I'm going to throw this
transition shade into my crease because
I really want to have a nice fade up to
the brow this is just a sigma brush by
the way sorry I'm breaking out to you I
look at my breakout so we get to
Foundation and I will say I'm not much
of a pink person like pink eye shadows
rosy tone but we're going to experiment
with a little bit of that today and just
see how I like it
for a bridal look I'm in my dress is
more it's more I'm gonna describe my
dress isn't like really modern or
anything when I necessarily say so on
the vintage side but it's not like I
don't know I think when you guys see it
you'll be like oh really because I
didn't think I was going to pick this
one either but I really really love it
and I take the lightest amount of this
purple tone not much at all and all I do
is throw that into the crease right
below that first shade that we use I'm
really keeping it light I don't want it
to look like BAM purple you know what I
mean so let me keep it light and pretty
here put more in the outer V
kind of take them onto the lid as well
I'm going to go about half way with that
color on my lid I wanted to look like a
hint of purple like a purple mall but I
don't want it to look super purple so
that way still kind of like that
feminine pretty color but it's not in
your face I want to keep this area
pretty light and bright and open because
if you're not careful it will really
close off your eye and in photos that
never looks good so I like to keep the
inner corner really bright but I like to
do that anyways all mine looks pretty
much because I don't have like the
biggest eyes and my eyes aren't super
open you know what I mean like they are
pretty droopy so I just like to kind of
enhance that inner corner to really open
up the eye and make me look a little bit
more awake so you can see that I shadow
just adds a little bit of a pretty color
in there but it's nothing too crazy so
have you guys been following my vlog
channel I've been taking along the
wedding planning process so if you don't
know I do have a vlog channel you should
go check it out I'll leave a link down
below now I'm going to add just a little
bit of this shade right here to the
outer V as well to really deepen it up
I'm not going to go further in than I
did with that purple shadow Shirley
keeping this here in the outer half just
still adds a little bit of color and
nothing too crazy I also say like your
Bridal makeup look it's so up to you
like screw what anyone else does if you
want a full-blown smokey eye you go do a
full-blown smokey eye it is your day
your wedding look how you want under
that out there because I know sometimes
you were like oh you probably shouldn't
do that very wedding day and it's like
I'll do what I want you don't want to
add just a little bit more of that
burgundy color right out here a little
bit thoroughly like that shape now I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to use
this shade in the palette nice and
bright so I am going to use the Too
Faced glitter glue because I find with
these Natasha de Nona
shimmery eye shows it's good to use it
just to make sure nothing falls on your
face throughout the day so if you've
never used the Too Faced glitter glue
before definitely practice with it
because practice makes perfect lips of
things because if you
aren't careful and it dries it is not
something you can blend out so just keep
that in mind when you're using this you
put it exactly where you want it and
then apply your eyeshadow and you do it
one eye at a time like do a full eye
before you move on now I'm just going to
go into that eye shadow just so pretty
and I'm going to pack this in here you
really kind of cutting out that crease
and then just patting it and then you
can move on to your second eye if you
have a third eye you could do that one
next just giving me my wedding colors
vibes right now so funny
the other look that I'm planning on
doing is very simple similar technique
to this but completely different colors
so if you guys I'm going to see that I
will definitely do it for you
so I'm going to go back in with this
brush have a little bit more of that
purple on here I'm just going to very
lightly blend out the edges of this
shadow that's pretty much it with the
eye shadow now we're going to do is we
are going to line our eyes now I love
doing a winged liner again the same way
that this eye shadow kind of angled up
and opens up the eyes I really feel like
wings a liner opens them up as well and
just lift the eye so I am going to do a
winged liner I'm going to use my
wingwoman liner from Bilotti London and
this is a matte liner which is what I
prefer to wing out with not like a shiny
liner
the key with wing liner is to really
follow that lower lash line up so even
though you do see this eye shadow here
that means I brought it down too far
like the tape was too far but as long as
you follow this lower lash line up
towards the end of your brow it really
will make it all sink and just lift of
that eye if I were to put the eyeliner
down here like if I would have gone
straight right here it would have looked
more droopy it would have gave me that
lift effect that this is giving me so
just keep that in mind always folder
your lower lash line now I'm just going
to take a makeup wipe and clean below
that liner and also clean up the liner
as well to make it nice and sharp and
the nails really help with this as well
I'm just going to clean that up I'm also
getting any eyeshadow that fill on my
face so I am going to apply lashes off
camera just because it does take a while
these are very with these two letter e
beautiful lashes I love the lower lashes
because they look very natural they
these are these the lower mink lashes in
see-through and they're just really with
the improvy and I think they look really
great with this look so I'm going to go
ahead and apply these and then I'll be
back to apply my face makeup okay so
lashes are on and we will touch up the
liner in just a moment but now I'm going
to go ahead and prime my face I'm going
to use the Smashbox photo finish primer
water I'm actually going to try the
Natasha de Nonna one of them here's what
happened you really love this primer and
I want to try this one out so the canon
austin one believe it or not let's go
ahead and spray our face and then i'm
going to apply this primer by natasha de
Nona in my t-zone just doing it my
problem areas so i'm going to take about
that much rub between my three fingers
or six but three on each hand and then
put this in the center of my face really
nice primer still super good on the skin
and now we're going to try out two
different products so i'm going to try
the Giorgio Armani power fabric long
wear high coverage foundation mixed with
B Double Wear love the double air this
one's kind of good but I'd like to sum a
little bit better so we're going to try
them
this is in the shade 6.5 and then I also
have tawny right here
you know sometimes mixing foundations is
better and this has such bad flashback
that figured it'd be good to mix with
the Georgia Romani just to see if it
looks a little better in photos because
it's such a gorgeous foundation and then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
with the Beautyblender on one side and
then I will try a brush on the other so
I'm going to actually use this L'Oreal
Bunge
just to see how I like it applied more
like a sponge butter
do I like a brush better you don't find
out today this looks so pretty look at
that Matt say oh I love it
really not even using that much covering
ups like a dream
actually I was thinking I was going to
go over the brush but I'm so far liking
the sponge and I think I'm just going to
leave it like this shouldn't continue
use a sponge one thing too about Estee
Lauder that I love is it never breaks up
it just stays put that's what you got to
look for in a foundation especially for
a wedding day it's going to be a long
half day so you always will something
that's going to last so well through the
heat humidity and this is so good
so hopefully the Armani one can help it
with flashback and not have it look so
crazy now we're going to go on with
concealer many is my tried-and-true
favorites the heart-shaped tape and then
the Maybelline fit me I just love the
way these look on my skin and they last
really well throughout the day no matter
how much I'm sweating anything like that
these just last so well then I'm going
to use my sponge and blend this out I'm
going to drag it down and under so like
this I'm just going to drag it out and
kind of press and roll take this all the
way down heart-shaped tube is so good
covering pretty much anything
clean up this liner and take a little
blending brush and just go right in the
inner corner as well you don't really
leave that inner corner hanging you
definitely want to add concealer in
there just to again brighten it up can
make you look nice and awake I get
really dark in here so I definitely have
to conceal now we're going to go ahead
and set the under eyes I'm going to be
using this Ulta press the setting powder
in banana I'm going to be doing this
instead of having a baking session
happen because I find sometimes baking
can make me look a little too cakey and
if I use a powder that is just too light
you know like the translucent powders
those tend to show up in photos and have
a nice flashback well not a nice flash
but I tend to have a flashback and you
want to avoid that as much as possible
so just setting with this yellow tone to
powder just to make sure it's all nice
and set and actually looks really good
on the skin just a little bit of a
dusting of that and I'm going to take a
little bit more on the outer parts of my
face just to make sure everything is set
and then our bronzer will blend really
nicely now for bronzer I am going to use
the Marc Jacobs fantastic bronzer I
don't think they have this for sale
anymore which kind of sucks but this was
like a limited edition thing but it is a
really great product so I'm going to go
ahead and bronze my skin with this first
going cheeks and go up to the forehead
just in circular motions I have a really
light hand with this blending it out why
and with the tarp clay play pallets I'm
going to take this shade right here and
I'm going to contour with this great
pigment in it so just be warned
contouring is so important like for
photos Oh makes such a big difference go
underneath my lip and my jaw so for life
I'm going to be using the lorac
technicolor buildable blush just look
like this has a nice little pinky flush
to it you can apply a little bit of that
to my cheeks I think blush is really
important for photos good to have some
color to the face so I'm just lightly
dusting this from my apples back like
that do a light blend and then for
highlight I'm going to be using my
Smashbox highlight palette in Pearl
should make it so pretty and in Li
mixing these two shades you're just
going to highlight with that just going
to soft pretty glow
just never emphasizing texture it looks
so good on the skin so pretty so then
I'm going to fill in my brows and then I
will be back to a wrap up this look for
you guys okay so brows are done and now
I'm going to go ahead and highlight
underneath head elite I'm going to go
ahead and highlight underneath the brow
and again I'm going to use my stash box
palette and curl and I'm going to use
this shade right here in the palette
just to really highlight that brow bone
take it all the way in blending it down
just really blended these blending
really easily I just love the way it
looks like my highlight on my brow bone
is the same as like my face highlight
she looks so nice I'm gonna add this
makeup geek eyeliner in plum Maria to my
waterline I wish I had max custard we
should hear but don't think I have it
but ended up adding Urban Decay's
alkaline on top just oh it wasn't so
reddish like a more red burgundy on my
lower lash line so now I'm going to go
in I'm going to take a flat brush like
this I'm going to use this shade right
here and press this up against my lower
lash line right up against it
I'm going to go with a little bit of a
deeper brown just to kind of tone that
down a little bit yeah that looks better
so again it's like a trial you know
we're trying these things out together
I'm gonna flesh again put the pencil
brush blend out the edges got that brown
on top that way better illness go with a
brown on my waterline as well like the
burgundy on the lower lash line look a
little too much so I'm going to go in
with I would like to take max coat to
reach but I don't have it if I'm
actually going to put this black liner
on my waterline like on top fish wasn't
ceilings that burgundy color is remember
whatever my scary use you wanted to be
waterproof this is not waterproof but I
will have it that day I actually don't
own any waterproof right now well I do
but I'm using it for video and I haven't
opened it yet always use waterproof
mascara or you will be screwed like that
I like this mascara because it makes my
bottom lashes look really Sluttery now
I'm just going to touch up to my liquid
liner so that is the eyes done now we're
going to move on to lips I'm taking this
Fiona styles lip liner in Cornelia
I'm using more feed schoolgirl which is
a really pretty pinky mauve color pinky
nude so this is just a little too pink
I'm going to add virgin on top of that
Bice a lighter nude with this look just
a little bit pinky and I like the color
combo of these two I don't know if I'm
going to go with a gloss or a matte lip
I'm thinking I'm going to go with a
matte lip just because it lasts longer
then I'll just bring it with me
throughout the reception and all that
but if I do a gloss is going to be
something like this this is the Becca
liquid crystal lips topper and this one
is in the shade this is a champagne
dreams X Bellini this one's really
pretty kind of goes with the eyes but
something like this to where you still
have a lot of that matte color going
through and this doesn't have like a
super pigmented base you know what I
mean like a viscous on your lip or your
teeth not necessarily like a pigmented
gloss on your teeth so if I do though
with something it would probably be bit
so that is the first little child that I
did I know for some people this is a lot
this is a lot of color for a wedding day
but I think it's still really pretty and
really feminine at the same time so I
really like it this is definitely a
contender and a lot of these looks that
I'm doing will kind of narrow down when
I saw my dress because when I get that
I'm gonna put it on do it what makeup
look do I want to do that is this video
I really hope you guys enjoyed it let me
know down below what you thought the
next one is definitely going to be more
basic thank you guys again so much for
watching and I will see you all in my
next video bye
