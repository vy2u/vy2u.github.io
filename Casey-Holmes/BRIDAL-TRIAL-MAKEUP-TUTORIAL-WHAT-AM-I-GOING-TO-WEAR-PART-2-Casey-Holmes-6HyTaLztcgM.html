be doing my last bridal trial makeup
look now I knew I wanted to do more of
these and if I have time I will
definitely do one more that is more
drugstore I did do a previous one where
it's testing out just different makeup
products a different makeup look to see
what I want to wear for my wedding day I
think this is gonna be the last one
because I feel in my bones that this is
the look that I'm gonna do because it's
one of those staple classic Bridal looks
just something really pretty and I just
don't think I'm gonna switch it up maybe
I will do a drugstore version of this
look because I just feel like this is it
you know and I think you guys will
really enjoy it it's one of those
classic looks you can use for do you
want to do it everyday you can wear this
look if you're going on a date night
just switch up the lip color if you want
to wear it in the fall time you know
what I'm saying
it's up to you I was gonna put on a
fancy like white shirt then I was like
what if I get makeup on it anyways if
you guys are interested in this video
then definitely keep watching and let me
know down below if you want me to do a
drugstore version of this look and I
will definitely do that for you guys and
yeah if you want to see my probably last
bridal trial makeup look then let's just
go ahead and get started alright so let
me prep my green tea before we get
started I love this honest green tea I
actually just got a package puts it over
the weekend I think was over the weekend
with like 13 of these and I've already
drank them all and it's only Wednesday
alright moving on let's start off with
the eyes so first off we're gonna use my
favorite primer one that I know
eyeshadow will stay on all day
it's a Smashbox photo-finish lid primer
and light you definitely want an
eyeshadow primer if this is the first
Bridal trial you're seeing definitely
get an eyeshadow primer because it's
gonna keep your makeup on all day knock
well your eyeshadow just put this on
your face this is a great one because it
does have that tint so it just cancels
out any redness if you have any veins it
covers that up it's just a great base to
have and do this before but I highly
recommend setting it with a powder just
so it's locked in all day
and I'll show you guys how I do that
here so I pulled out some of my best
items for this look like I'm not talking
I'm not kidding when I say my best items
I have the Natasha John I had the
Natasha de Nona Bowl a kiss blat I've
had a hard time speaking today I pulled
out my Natasha Genoa blackest black
matte eyeshadow I was not playing any
games today
this look is gonna be bomb and then it
also brought out my Natasha de Nona AHA
Tasha you know at my last Bridal trial
this one is the one was like the green
brown stuff like that a couple of these
kind of cracked which is why it's
everywhere but so this is what I'll be
using today I do recommend I don't know
if Smashbox still has it out but there
was a Smashbox palette that was really
great for this kind of look it had like
nine eyeshadows two bronzers two
highlighters and then some brow products
in it I can't remember what it's called
but I don't have it in my drawers so I'm
gonna take a wild guess and say it's not
available anymore but I'm gonna look it
up online and check it out if it is I
will link that down below because that
is a great alternative for this look
because it has everything that you need
and it's just really easy and the
shadows are amazing I am gonna go in
with this pinky cream shade right here
in the Natasha denote a palette and I'm
gonna set my entire lid with this so
that we have a nice even base also the
look that I'm doing is pretty simple I
feel like even if you're somewhat of a
beginner with makeup you could probably
do this look because it's just a few
steps to get your eyeshadow done which I
really appreciate because you know for
your wedding day if you're gonna do your
own makeup you don't want to be sitting
there for five hours doing your shadow
you know what I'm saying I am still
going to be doing my own makeup just
because why spend the money when I can
do it myself you know so I'm just gonna
do my makeup I know what works for me
it's just all about picking the right
products that I want to use for the day
that being said we're gonna move on to
the next shadow so I'm gonna use this
shadow right here I'm going to use it
into the crease as our transition shade
but first I'm going to zoom you guys in
if you're wondering what's going on with
my hand I just filmed an Amazon
make up look we're not gonna talk about
it here it was rough and then another
sad thing I looked at like I was going
to snapchat my Fiji vlog on my computer
because I'm editing it like finishing it
up and the camera was facing me and I
was like whoa girl it was ugly so
anyways I'm gonna take that shade and
we're gonna go into the crease I have
mentioned to you guys before I know I'm
like a broken record talking about
Natasha de Nonna
every time I use these I just I enjoy it
and I know it's gonna be good you know
what I mean so I'm so sorry I think I
feel bad for always using these palettes
but I did buy them and I do want to use
them so I mean that's why I use them
constantly and I love them I promise you
I'm just trying to get my juice out of
it too because most of time when I do my
makeup it's gonna be for YouTube videos
in my day-to-day life I don't wear
makeup every single day just because a
lot of the times I don't have time on
trying to get other stuff done but
whenever I'm filming you know I like to
go ahead and use things that I love and
then I want to get good use out of
and then when I'm also testing things
out sometimes you know these get put
like I haven't used this palette in a
while so this is just our all-over
transition color so that when we put the
darker shades on it will fade up to the
brow and look very seamless highly
important I recommend doing that next up
we will go in with this brown right here
so I'm using mostly all matte shades
till we get to one particular shade
which you guys will see so all matte
shades till we get there we're pretty
much using only for eye shadows in this
look so use whatever you have that you
feel like look similar so I'm gonna go
with this deep brown and a sigma e25 tap
it off I'm going to put this in the
outer V and throw it into my crease as
well going a little over halfway with
the blending but focusing it mainly here
on the outer V
I have more downturned eyes I used to
call my eyes like sad puppy-dog eyes
because they're so downturn then I can
do like a really good sad face and like
when I cry it's like really sad at least
I think so I like to do looks especially
for big events like a wedding or if I'm
going to a really nice event things
that's really gonna open up the eye and
make me look more awake which is why
some people wouldn't do wing liner for
their wedding I would do we wine or just
because it really lifts them up and
opens up that eye for me it really is
all about kind of customizing your
makeup look to your eye shape and you
know that's a lot of the reason why
people do the same technique on their
eyes because it just looks good I just
know that this style looks good on my
eyes and I know it looks good in photos
which is why I think even though the
last Bridal trial I did I loved the
color I might actually do that for the
rehearsal dinner because I loved it so
much I think I'm gonna actually the day
of watch that video and recreate that
look because I really loved the colors
and it kind of went along with the
wedding so now I'm gonna go back in with
this transition shade we use and I'm
going to lightly blend out those edges
with it just so it's all nice and
seamless and you can go a little bit
over the brown just to really blend that
out alright so the next shadow we're
gonna use is Nina Tasha - Nona blackest
black eyeshadow this is the blackest
black eyeshadow that I have and it also
blends very very well it's really easy
to work with I feel like if you're a
beginner this would be a great eyeshadow
to work with if you want to incorporate
black sometimes black eyeshadow can be
choppy it could be hard to work out and
sometimes it can really ruin a makeup
look this is not the case with this one
it's very pigmented go in with a light
hand and you'll be set just gonna tap my
brush in there and I'm gonna focus this
right in the outer V I'm not gonna go in
further like I did with the brown I'm
just gonna focus it right out here too
deep
the look just like that then what I'm
going to do is go back into the first
pallet take that Brown and I'm going to
lightly just go over the edges of this
black and blend it out so I'm going back
into the crease I'm really making sure
it's all nice and faded out and blending
out the edges of it so it's not all
completely black because we're putting
some Brown in here but it's still pretty
deep on the outer V now if you don't
want something this smoky skip the black
just stick with the brown and then do
the next shadow that I'm going to show
you and you'll be good
y'all know I'm dramatic okay but just
because you have this right here and you
feel like whoa that's intense don't be
afraid just yet next up we're gonna do
the final eyeshadow and it is going to
be this one now you could do a matte
cream shadow to keep this all matte and
seamless I don't know if I'm gonna go
with matte or if I'm gonna go with this
one this one's in the palette so I'm
gonna use it it's not super glittery or
anything like that it's just a really
pretty
glowy shade so I'm going to use the Mac
242 case you guys are wondering I do
have a full video mentioning my favorite
brushes I will link that down below or
right up here if you want to check that
out we're gonna go in with this shade
and then we're going to put this right
in the areas that we did not put shadow
so right in that area as you guys can
see this brush is curved on the top so
it makes it really easy to carve out
this crease you see that so this is the
brush I like to use to pack on lid color
and all that kind of stuff because it
just goes right there in the crease and
carves it out I do like this shadow in
here but I will probably go with a matte
cream color that is super pigmented but
we'll see what this looks like in the
end as well because sometimes these look
better I'm gonna take this brush right
here I'm just gonna dust this so I just
dusted this right here on the edges to
blend them all together so that they're
seamless so you can see it's a little
choppy here all you do is take a little
bit of light pressure that's why I love
these shadows and blend them and you're
good so this is the eye shadow that's it
what was that one counting the color to
set the eyeshadow primer it was one two
three four five five shades you probably
have these five colors in your
collection just because they're kind of
staple colors I feel like that every
palette pretty much has so we'll fix
everything else in a little bit like
these outer corner edges we will fix all
of that because we have foundation to
put on I'm going to be trying out this
liner for a little while this is from
Amazon it's a felt tip eyeliner pen so
I'm actually probably gonna upload this
one before that Amazon video so you
kinda already know that I like this but
I did like this eyeliner I was gonna go
in with my mega forever ink liner but
the only thing is I have been having the
biggest issue with it running here in
the inner corner like it kind of runs
down and it's not even because my eyes
get watery it just for some reason just
like runs on my eyes we were just
thinking I am NOT gonna be using that to
my wedding day I have found out because
I just don't want to chance it I don't
want to worry about it for pictures and
I don't have to worry about my makeup
for the rest of the night so this one I
just tried but it does a really great
job at creating that winged liner and
it's a very pointy felt tip so that's it
I brought it all the way here in the
inner core
and now I'm going to follow my lower
lashline up and out to create the wing
and having this inter color right here
nice and bright you can have that smoky
look but it's not going to overwhelm the
eye close your eye off anything like
that so keeping this inner part light
and bright I feel like is key would
recommend a waterproof liquid liner as
well if you start crying or if you know
that you're gonna bawl your eyes out oh
it's suggest not doing a wing liner
unless you use some good waterproof
stuff that you've tested otherwise I
wonder what recommend the winged liner
because you'll go to clean up your tears
out here and you're just gonna smudge
that wing whereas if you just do a line
that's easier to clean up nobodies can't
really notice that you're missing half
your wing alright and now we're ready
for mascara and lashes mascara is not
really a big deal I'll just throw on any
mascara that I have that's waterproof
I think I'm actually gonna go with these
these are from Amazon so here's the
brand from Amazon I'm gonna try these
out because these look like really
pretty fluttery wispy lashes that would
look great for a wedding day
I love these Sydney ones by Lily lashes
and just feel like for a wedding day
they're a little too dramatic or not I
think they're a little too dramatic yeah
I think these are the way to go these
aren't touching my brow but they still
have a fluffy look to them I'm gonna put
those on and I'm gonna come back and we
will do our face think up so we're back
we're ready I'm gonna go ahead and prime
my face I'm gonna use my regular primers
that I love and then I know I'm gonna
use and that is the Smashbox primer
water and the Canaan austin mattifying
primer you don't have to actually spray
that much but I just really like the way
it feels and then I really like this
cane in Austin mattifying primer because
it does modify the skin it keeps you
matte it doesn't get oily or make you
look like a greaseball throughout the
day and it really does fill in your
pores it's so good I know it has SPF 50
but I've never had an issue with it
flashing back it's just me and you can
see how much I've used it also a little
bit does go a long way so I would just
use like that's too much I just put too
much on my finger but we're just gonna
have to make that work I would probably
do this much on my finger but we got a
lot today so
I like to put this in the t-zone
anywhere I have texture large pores wear
foundations kind of break up on me which
is my forehead sometimes as well as my
nose breaks up really bad this area
right here is where I have the most
texture because of my rosacea so I
really make sure I focus it there
everywhere else is just kind of like you
know I need to prime there but this is
where I need all that pore filling we're
gonna use a different foundation combo
because I tried this and I love the
combo it is the widest sell all ours
foundation mixed with Estee Lauder
Double Wear I did go out and purchase
another double wear because a lot of you
were like they reformulated it without
SPF are gonna be using these two
together I'm using the shade warm honey
bee d50 and 3w one tani to kind of
lighten it up a bit I mean I am kind of
tan now so I don't know we might have to
fix that but we will see okay so I'm
actually gonna use the shade for in one
a last so well and they look so good on
the skin now I know the way if someone
has a high alcohol content and you know
don't use it if you do not feel
comfortable but I don't use this
foundation every single day I'm fine
with it for the wedding day you know
what I'm saying I'm gonna actually try
to use it with a different brush today
normally I would use my it cosmetics one
but it's super dirty so I'm gonna use
this not so dirty one this is a tart
brush I've used it like once just gonna
put this on my skin
it just looks so freakin pretty on your
skin like these two together I mentioned
and what was it my lip favorites video
one of my most recent favorites videos
that the SI lawyer one is good sometimes
it can look a little cakey if you're not
careful why sell just looks beautiful on
the skin but doesn't last as long as dub
wear so mixing the two together gives
you that perfect combo of not having
cakey skin and also getting the
longevity out of both okay now moving on
we're gonna use the same old concealers
tart shape tape Maybelline fit me
because it's what I know and love and
what stays on the longest so we'll be
using the shade light/medium in the
Tarte shape tape I'm also taking this
one down my nose because this concealer
lasts so well on my nose then I will
take the Maybelline fit me and ten light
and we will just add a little bit of
this to add for a highlight then I'm
gonna take a brush I'm actually use that
same foundation brush and blend it out
normally I don't use brushes but right
now I don't feel like getting up and
wetting my sponge which is very lazy of
me fully aware I feel like there hasn't
been a concealer to compare to
heart-shaped tape like it's just so
freakin good
so full coverage I did go in with quite
a bit but as I go if I notice they have
too much product on my brush I will wipe
it off and go back in and blend
everything out because I don't want any
excess product just sitting on my skin I
do want to wipe it off so I just keep a
towel and wipe off any excess right
there now to go in and blend out the
inner corner parts right here with
concealer because it's really important
to get right in there I will either use
this it cosmetics airbrush blurring
concealer or this blurring concealer by
Smashbox they're pretty much the same
brush whichever one you want to get I
don't know which one's cheaper but
whichever one's cheaper but when you put
the concealer in here it just really
brightens up that area let me tell you I
went back and forth with this I used it
for so long how long was it like
whatever first came out and it was like
super hyped up and then I kind of got
away from it use drugstore stuff which I
do have a few drugstore powders I'm
obsessive but for big events and days
that you're gonna have flash and a lot
of photos taken Laura Mercier is the way
to go I mean I use this on the smashbox
trip i didn't have any
she was flashback everything looked
really nice I'm going to go in with a
bigger powder brush
and we're just gonna set every inch of
the space because I'm very oily I also
have a smaller size that you can buy and
pretty sure I used to have the smaller
size loved it so if you don't want to
buy a big one there is a smaller option
okay moving on to bronzer I'm actually
gonna use this Ulta bronzer I don't know
if this is what I'm gonna use the day of
but I'm gonna keep testing it out I kind
of just step back into this after doing
a fall makeup look so I'm gonna mix
warmth bronze and bombshell bronzer
taking it up to the forehead cuz the
forehead needs love too and then to
contour this is actually from my Amazon
video again this is the whatup beaches
matte bronzer like what up beaches it's
just a matte cool toned bronzer that I
think is perfect for contouring and
that's what it looks like isn't this so
pretty it's just like a soft contour I
don't really do my forehead much because
I feel like bronzers enough so I just
kind of leave it alone but for lunch I'm
gonna using this new Tarte palette I
know I loved Hart blushes especially
their Amazonian clay blushes which this
is full of I believe they just came out
with this for maybe the holidays I could
be wrong so I'm just gonna go in with
this one which is in the shade angelic
look at that wash of color so pretty
they never look like too much on your
Chiefs and I feel like blush is a really
important step in your Bridal makeup
because just add some color back to your
face next up we're gonna highlight so I
know for my wedding day I'm gonna use
these spotlight palette and pearl
because I feel like it just looks best
on my skin very smooth it doesn't
accentuate my pores it gives me a
blinding highlight and I just really
like it and obviously because the one
he's the most but I do mix a lot of
these and with it so I am gonna be using
this today if you're tired of seeing it
I'm sorry but I love it just so gorgeous
I feel like for brides this isn't
seneschal do the same on this side I'm
just gonna buff it in the skin so it
just looks so stinking pretty smooth
glowy just okay now what I'm gonna do is
just fill in my brows I am going to use
the Loreal brow stylist shape and fill
in blonde and then also the benefit
precisely my brows so I'm gonna quickly
do these and then I'll be back because
Browns again are very personal so do
what you feel works best for you but it
takes me forever to fill in my brows so
I'm going to quickly fill them in and
I'll be right back warehouse are done
now we're gonna move on to our lower
lash line so what I'm gonna do for my
waterline is actually use a brown liner
to shade down to earth and I'm going to
just bring it in halfway on the eye now
let's move back on to shadow so I'm
going back into the natascha denote a
pallet and I'm gonna go in with the
brown that we use which is this one
right here flat definer brush from Sigma
so I'm gonna dip my brush in there I'm
again I'm gonna connect this to that
wing I'm just gonna bring it in right
here
taking the littlest amount in the inner
corner just to help it really blend all
together but you're just wanting to push
this right up against that lower lash
line so there's no spaces in between
your skin and your waterline and then
I'm gonna take a pencil brush and go in
with the transition shade that we used
and I'm just going to lightly blend out
those edges so I'm kind of going right
on top of it but also going a little bit
below to really fade it out and make it
look you see how it kind of goes from
that dark brown to that lighter shade it
just looks really pretty has like a nice
gradient effect it just looks really
nice so I go a little bit on top and
then I go right below I'm using a very
light hand just so it's all really
smoked out nicely and then lastly you do
want to put a waterproof mascara down on
your lower lashes
I don't currently have one so I'm just
gonna use this wet wild skinny mascara
always do waterproof though we need to
highlight our brow bone so I'm gonna
take the 242 brush from Mac again I'm
going to take the shade that we used on
our lid and I'm gonna highlight the brow
bone definitely think highlighting the
brow is important it I can't believe I
almost forgot that so we're just gonna
pop that right there next up is lips I'm
still testing different lip colors out
but I'm probably gonna go with something
like this something that's definitely
gonna show up in photos but something
that's matte so it doesn't get
everywhere I'm thinking about either the
Smashbox liquid lips because I love them
they're so nice they never get on my
teeth and they're not super dry but I've
been recently experimenting with these
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte liquid lips
and I really like them so I'm gonna try
this color in nudists but first I am
going to line my lips with Palladio
clÃ¡udio lip liner it's in the shade
gingerbread then I'm gonna go in with
nudists L'Oreal had like a matte gloss
that came out and at first I thought
this was what that was gonna be but it
definitely dries down and it's a really
nice formula so whoo I like this color
oh yeah that's like mm-hmm
my kind of color okay guys so this is
the final look I really like it like I
said this is definitely one that I will
probably do for the ceremony just
because I love it it's just one of those
classic looks and I just can't get
enough of it I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video
