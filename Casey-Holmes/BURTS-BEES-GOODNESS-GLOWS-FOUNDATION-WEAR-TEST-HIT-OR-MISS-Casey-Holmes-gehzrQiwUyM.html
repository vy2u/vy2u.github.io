be testing out the new of Burt's Bees
foundation this is the goodness glows
right yes liquid makeup so I'm going to
be applying this on camera wearing it
throughout the day and I will show you
guys how it wears and what I think about
it I also have a couple other things
from Burt's Bees that I'm going to share
with you guys in this video umm things
that I did like didn't like and you know
just kind of like my thoughts and
everything so don't forget if you're not
subscribed already be sure to hit that
subscribe button down below if you want
you could buy a rosy day shirt you want
to know what more about this foundation
and see me wear it throughout the day
then let's just go ahead and get started
okay so hair is back I'm gonna be using
my Smashbox primer water and also the
soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a blot primer
as well this is really great mattifying
primer and this is a great length most
rising primer for oily skin so I'm gonna
apply this one first do apply like a
crap-ton of the stuff that's just
because I really like it and I'm gonna
let that sink into the skin and I'm
gonna use this primer like I said from
soap &amp;amp; Glory and I'm gonna use this only
in this area on my nose and on my chin
I'm not gonna go to my forehead because
my foreheads actually a little dry today
so just gonna focus this kind of my
t-zone just on my forehead so I've got a
little dollop of that I have tried this
foundation and I kind of know what I
think of it but I figured we do a final
thought okay so like I said this is the
Burt's Bees goodness glows foundation it
just looks like this I'll be using the
shade warm honey today this is a really
great shade for me so I'm gonna read the
back for you real quick it says our full
coverage of mineral formula leaves skin
smoother and more radiant with natural
finish that's not heavy or greasy our
moisturizing foundation instantly
hydrates and nourishes skin with meadow
foam seed oil I hope I said that right
known for its skin moisturizing benefits
for naturally beautiful results both
inside and out so this retails for 1582
at Walmart in 16 and 99 at Ulta so it's
a pretty up there drugstore foundation
at least in my opinion I feel like this
little pricey so we're gonna make sure
it's a really good foundation before we
just go out and buy it or you go already
public so I'm gonna using the biggest
sponge I've heard this is the Real
Techniques face and body sponge so it's
like matte for your body in your face
I've been like sickly enjoying this for
my face I love how big it is so I am
just
today so I'm gonna apply it to one side
of my face first just so you guys can
see the coverage of the foundation found
I like the sponge best one thing I don't
like about this foundation and I don't
really know what it is but I hate this
smell and it's only when I'm applying it
like I don't know what it smells like it
smells like something that went bad I
mean it doesn't smell like bad makeup if
you guys have this foundation let me
know if you know what I'm talking about
because I feel like there's just a smell
to it and I'm not really filling the
smells coverage it's pretty dang good
is it not so this is what one side looks
like has really great coverage you can
see it has a bit of shine to it so I'm
gonna go ahead and apply the rest of the
foundation on the other side when I
first use this foundation I thought
there was glitter in it but I don't
think there's glitter in it but there's
some sort of shimmery there's something
in there like it looks like you took a
liquid highlighter and mixed it in with
your foundation if you know what I mean
like I haven't tried a glowy foundation
that I feel like looks like I mixed in
liquid highlighter you know what I'm
saying
like most the time they just make me
look glowy but this has like I don't
know there's something different about
the shine of this one you know what I'm
saying I don't think it's bad but that's
how I feel about it if you guys don't
know I probably should've mentioned this
in the beginning of the video I have
very oily skin a sensitive skin and the
redness in the meeting that you saw is
rosacea that is my skin type I get very
very oily especially right in here my
chin my forehead I look a hot mess if I
don't use the right foundations or the
right primers things can just kind of
slide all over the place I've been
willing to try more things like this out
lately because I feel like a lot of the
times right now glowy foundations are
more on the matte side so I can wear
them I don't know there's anybody else
feel like that this is the coverage of
it and you can kind of see how it looks
on the skin the only thing I don't
really like about it is it's getting
really cakey around my nose I don't know
I get so kicking around my nose but it
does it kind of every time so here's
what I think about this foundation so
far I apply this I feel like it sets
down to a matte finish but it looks like
they mixed
in some sort of liquid highlight like if
it were me looks like they mix in some
sort of liquid a highlight to make it
look glowy but it's not like a glowy
formula that makes sense I hope that
makes sense if not I'm sorry moving on
I'm gonna apply concealer I'm only gonna
use torch shape tape today I'm using
light/medium honey and I'm gonna put
this underneath my eyes I could always
do every time I do these kind of videos
I always do everything the same because
I give every foundation a fair chance
now tart shaped a pin this foundation
look really really good together I wore
this yesterday and I was pleasantly
surprised at how it looked I feel like
they just meshed together it seems like
the tart shaped tape just melts into it
and it looks gorgeous now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna set my concealer in my
face with the Too Faced peach perfect
mattifying a loose setting powder I love
this I mentioned in my 2017 favorites I
know this is a word test but I figured I
would show you guys everything that I
put on my face because I do have other
Burt's Bees makeup to apply like just
cool I just had the blushes that I
figured I would show you so I'm just
didn't take my sponge and set everything
combo of all three of these products is
pretty phenomenal running some errands
today by the way so you guys will get to
see you out and about I don't know if
it's raining or not I feel like the
weather's kind of on and off here but I
will show you guys me out and about and
show you in different lighting so now
we're gonna move on to bronzer and I'm
gonna be using the Neutrogena Healthy
Skin sprong xur in 130 Sunkist I'm just
going to use this to bronze up my skin
this is gonna make me look like a bronze
clot glottis a bronze God is here in a
few minutes and this brush is from TJ
Maxx I got it in a little set actually
did a whole video using makeup from TJ
Maxx that you always pass by so I went
in and purchased a bunch of different
makeup that I'm sure most of you guys
wonder about to tried it out and I have
to say most my face looked like crap but
there was a standout product which I'm
going to show you guys today and this
little brush tip that I have is the
Isabel Scott brush that was pretty
the item that I got from DJ Maxx that
was a hit it's a chunky palette but you
are going to be amazed amazed and I know
this videos about the foundation but
we're just going to talk about it so
it's the contour profusion palette and
it looks like the little book and you
open it up you have a mirror you would
get three brushes which mine are around
here somewhere
these are two of them actually use these
two brushes so I keep these in here we
have all these contour shades and the
highlights so I'm going to contour my
skin with this one
first this is honestly like the perfect
shade for me this is what I've been
contouring with for a while now actually
I think even before Christmas I was
contouring with this because it's really
good okay and before we do highlight I
am gonna apply blush I used this one
yesterday it's bare peach and this is
such a beautiful peach color I love it
the formula of these is really great too
they're nice and smooth everything I
wanted more in a blush but I have not
tried this one on my face this one is
toasted cinnamon and this just looks
like my kind of color so I'm gonna be
using this one on my face today oh and
this is the other brush that comes in
the contour palette - it's just a nice
little angled brush he's a Smashbox
brush and toasted cinnamon and I feel
like this is just gonna go so well my
bronzer I love warm blushes like this
look at that this is the problem I start
really loving the color and then I'm
like I love these I love the packaging
of them I think they're really great and
now we're gonna go back into this
contour palette and we're going to take
this highlight wrapped here this is more
like the champagne one the other ones
were bold in it is such a wet looking
highlighter it is so pretty
like I can't I can't get over this
highlighter I have been using this so
much
even over the anasazi one believe it or
not I took a break from that one cuz I
have been hooked on this one and it just
gives you that glow that gorgeous wet
look if you like highlighters like this
where it's kind of wet looking oh my god
you will love this I'm gonna take the
little brush that came in the palette
I'm gonna go on
keep its bow right in here and do a
little bit like this do the milk
mustache as Davis likes to call it and
then this one is just as beautiful this
little golden highlight right here I
mean I'm very impressed with this
palette like I said it does come with
three different brushes not sponsored I
bought this myself I'm just super
excited about it it's out of all the
things I tried from TJ Maxx this was
just the thing that really stood out to
me oh gosh and that was absolutely
amazing
okay next up I am going to really tell
you guys about this Burt's Bees bloomin
desert eyeshadow trio I did not like
this because they were so sheer
Augustine to them too so they just they
didn't work for me I thought there'd be
more mattes the color payoff is just not
there and I was really just pointing cuz
I was excited to try this palette
because I knew I would use it a lot
because of the color scheme they just
don't look good just not my cup of tea
so I would say pass on this if you've
tried any Burt's Bees I showed us that
you like let me know I'm down to try
more so before I fill in my brows I'm
gonna do the off-camera but I figured I
would show you guys this mascara as well
and I am gonna go ahead and tightline it
with this Burt's Bees eyeliner this is
in soft black so I'm gonna put this on
my upper waterline another thing that
I've done that I don't know if you're
supposed to put these new your eyes but
they're almost natural so should be fun
right but I'm gonna take toasted
cinnamon and I'm actually gonna fluff
this into my crease and this looks so
pretty in my crease I can't get over it
just going to take my brush and fluff
this in here I like to do a little
something on my eyes when I have makeup
on because I don't like it to look so
bare okay so I'm gonna use this Burt's
Bees nourishing mascara and I have it in
the shade black as well so I'm going to
show you guys this I always curl my
lashes no matter what I get mascaras a
fair shot because these lashes tend to
trip down eyelash curler that I use as a
shoe amaura one it is good this does
have a rubbery wand and I'm just
going to put this on my lashes and that
wand really does separate them really
well it kind of gives you wispy lashes
like faux lashes but look they just look
naturally wispy very pretty nothing too
crazy and I wore it at the gym and it
didn't like run all over my face
speaking of gym and makeup because I
never made I never wear makeup to the
gym only if I'm working and have to
do is when I wear makeup to the gym but
I got the Clinique workout makeup that's
like specifically for working out and if
you guys want me to try that out I will
be more than happy to because I did buy
it
Alta let me know in the comments if you
want to see that is this what the
mascara looks like just really lifted
separated lashes very nice now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go off camera
finished dress my face like my lips and
my eyebrows and then I'll be back to
show you a time tell you my thoughts let
you get a close-up look and then we will
wear this throughout the day okay guys
so I'm all done and ready to go about my
day so this is what everything is
looking like I feel like my skin looks
are really dang good with you again it
is a little cakey in the nose area but
other than that I think it looks really
nice on the skin the foundation does
love the blush will kind of see how that
wears throughout the day as well as well
as my scarib alright so right now it is
12:55 as you can see and like I said I'm
gonna take you guys along throughout my
day so see you in a little bit
hi guys so I'm about to do my first
update Wow what time did I do my last
update so like one it's only three
o'clock here but hey I got to get it in
while I can because it's daylight and
it's not gonna be daylight for long so
it is 243 253 errands I figured I would
show you guys how my foundation looks I
wanna take a little sneak peek to
actually doesn't look bad it definitely
does look a little thick around here but
everything else looks really good so far
it looks really good and natural lining
in my opinion we take you guys off this
little tripod so this is what it looks
like so far
well if you guys can see when we worn
this foundation for like what an hour
two hours I can't remember the last time
I was on with you guys but I'm gonna
wear it a little bit longer I'm actually
gonna wear this to the gym I know a lot
of people don't agree with that which I
mean like I don't wear makeup to the gym
every single time I've only worn makeup
to the gym whenever I'm working like if
I need to test stuff out I'll wear it to
the gym because I'm not taking off my
makeup if I need to work you know what
I'm saying yeah I'm gonna keep testing
it out it has a long way to go the rest
of the day and we'll see how it looks on
my oily skin so I will see you guys in
just a little bit hey guys so I'm back
looking better than ever
right now is pretty late it's way past
my bedtime
it is 1:13 in the morning I did go to
the gym I didn't have like to intensive
workout like I wasn't doing like really
a crazy cardio like sweating butt off
because I did that yesterday with leg
day but I did go to the gym and lasted
pretty well throughout the gym I will
say something about this foundation like
cast like some shadow right here I'm
telling you I've never had this issue
before or it looks like it kind of a
mustache but I will say everything is
like look at the highlight the highlight
has lasted all day throughout a workout
the blush the contour the bronzer
eyelashes I feel like are still pretty
up and good to go I feel like I still
kind of look the same I just look a
little bit oily I'm surprised I haven't
blotted I haven't put more powder on
anything like that it is looking cakey
right in here
my nose is looking pretty rough too it's
really not that bad it could be worse I
feel like for some reason like my dry
patches are showing here and again with
the ash eNOS
there's something about this that is
looking actually like I feel like I have
a little bit of a sheen this right here
I feel like it's like right in here - do
you guys see that I didn't put like an
ashy contour up here so I don't know
what that is but I have it like right
here - I don't know it's a little weird
but the most part lasted really well I'm
still gonna be trying this out I'm gonna
see if I can kind of figure out what
that different kind of color is see if I
can fix that it does work really well it
lasted all day I did get really oily or
anything
like that when I was out and about and
you know when I went worked out seems to
last really well on the skin it doesn't
accentuate a crazy amount of texture
look I mean everything is stayed on
highlight blush crazy so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you have tried
this foundation please let me know what
you think down below in the comments I
would love to hear your thoughts and I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
