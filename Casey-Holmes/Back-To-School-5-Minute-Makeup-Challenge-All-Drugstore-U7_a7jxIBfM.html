back-to-school 5 minute makeup challenge
I pretty much got a bunch of drugstore
stuff together and I've always wanted to
do the 5 minute makeup challenge but I
knew with my routine like what I do on a
day-to-day basis it just was not gonna
happen but I decided to try it out for
this back-to-school
um look because I know when I was in
high school I was always in a rush and
stuff so I had to you know it get stuck
done so it's a challenge but it's still
kind of showing you guys products that
are simply easy to use and really quick
and you can get it on go out the door in
5 minutes you will see if I make it in
five minutes or not but otherwise I hope
you guys enjoy this it's really simple
and basically for the eyes I just really
simple and same for the cheeks and
everything so um like this video if you
like it I don't recommend one thing I
did but I'll tell you that at the end of
the video it's just a personal problem
though that I'm having but I hope you
guys enjoy this don't forget to
subscribe and I will see you all next
time bye okay so I set my clock to 5
minutes I have no idea if you guys can
even see that but if I don't make it in
5 minutes it's just so gonna be under 10
min of a cup for a school um ok so buddy
I'm gonna try not to rush ok go I'm
gonna take the instant age rewind eraser
arc circle and I'm gonna place this all
over like any problem areas any exact
places I want to cover up and I'm just
going
all over my face it's kind of like not
really acting as a foundation it's just
I have broken out so bad I think the
Tarte claims like poreless primer has
really broken me out like bad I grow up
bad so now we're going to go underneath
our eyes at the room Oh match perfection
concealer and this isn't light got your
eyes those dark circles on that in his
schooldays
don't people think of we're feeling dead
go in your inner corner also
a little bit over our lid
okay I might say it's color tattoo and
back to the bronze
I'm just going to put this all over my
lid and a little into my crease blending
that with my fingers I love this color
you can just do anything with it and
you're set so just blend that then I'm
gonna take the elf quad and drama I'm
just gonna take the little white color
very lightly I'm just gonna put that
underneath my brow oh gosh there's
something on this brush this what
happened to my jump is underneath my
brow as a highlight
a little bit in my inner corners now I'm
gonna put and set my concealer real
quick with the elf High Definition
powder because that's important you want
to stay all day and I'm going to set my
face makeup with the cover talks ten
powder from Physicians Formula love this
stuff
put a little blush on with my wet wild
blush and pearlescent pink now we're
going to put in my C liquid liner on
bringing out just a little bit not much
I'm doing a very thin line how I was
over it Oh quick and smooth it out
sticking it up a little bit okay now for
a little bit of mascara
a little bit of eyeliner on the bottom
waterline little bit more mascara
I can't find my lip balm but I did other
than the lip balm that's pretty good and
I mean you could place this on on the go
anyways so it's okay so that's basically
my back-to-school look that's what I
would do um really natural eye some
winged liner or a little bit mascara and
some lip balm at least you have
something on your face right so that's
it I think I did okay I mean my eye
liner does not look crazy I probably
should have rubbed the concealer like
all over my face as a foundation because
it's not even meant for that but I get
carried away when I feel like I'm
seriously breaking out so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this and I will see you
all next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
