five different outfits for
back-to-school these are just ideas and
of course my own personal style so I
hope you guys enjoy I did too casual to
dressy and then one that's like more if
it's going into like the fall weather or
if it's kind of cool or where you live I
just included some boots or whatever so
I just decided to throw that into making
it even five well it's not really even
that's an odd number but you know what I
mean so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video give it a thumbs up if you did I
never do fashion videos all these tops I
purchased recently so you should still
be able to find them I purchase it like
within a week or two so I hope you guys
enjoyed this and I will see you all next
time bye
this top is from Express sounds like
that dark navy blue texture and with
some lighter blue and it has the V in
the front and it also has the V in the
back so I really like that so I just
paired some Abercrombie little capris
with this super super comfortable I love
the fact that they're destroyed and then
for shoes I would pair them with the old
Navy Navy flip-flops because it just all
goes in together
this shirt is from Charlotte Russe like
I told you guys in the beginning I did
purchase a lot of this stuff recently so
you should still be able to find this I
love this shirt I think it's so cute it
kind of has that orange red color and
buttons all the way down and then right
here you have this drawstring so if you
want to show a little skin kind of like
that no big deal you can just tie it
really tight and it will just like not
go anywhere for the whole entire day and
it's loose so it's super comfortable and
what I really like about it is it has
this lace detailing all the way on the
shoulders in the back so I thought this
shirt was super super cute I also paired
it with just a cream cami that I got
from forever 21 for pants I just paired
them again with the Abercrombie little
capris and then for shoes I paired them
with this Charlotte Russe sandal that
just has a black song so it goes with
everything
okay so now we're getting a little bit
more dressing this one this shirt is
from Express still that same kind of
dalam on top has this sort of V in the
front and the same V in the back really
love it super casual this is just a
basic top that's really great to have in
your wardrobe
then for jeans I just have these white
skinny jeans these are from TJ Maxx I
love them
I wear them a lot they're really nice
and loose but like they are very airy if
that makes any sense
and then for sandals I just paired them
with these little studded sandals just
to add a little edge to the outfit so
it's not too girly
okay so this outfit is probably my
favorite I just think it is so freakin
cute and adorable for school so pretty
much the top looks like this it has that
cold shoulder detail and I thought it
was just super super cute it's just this
really pretty I was caught sea foam kind
of turquoise color that's what I would
call it personally and you step back
it's really nice and loose and I don't
know if you could tell but it sort of
has that sharkbite bottom so it goes
like it goes kind of up in the middle
and then fades downwards and then the
back is just gorgeous I love it and I
paired it with this tank top because
since we're going to be at school
wouldn't want to be too revealing so I
really really really love this top I
think it is just adorable
and I purchased this from Nasty Gal comm
so I just got these blue skinny jeans
from TJ Maxx they fit absolutely
perfectly I love them they're just
playing blue jeans um and they have
nothing on the pockets and then for
sandals I paired it with this sandal I
got from JustFab I showed it in a hall a
while back I think it was like in June
or something but I love these they're
sort of cushioned I don't know if you
could tell so they fit really nicely I
don't know if they still have these but
they probably do just go check out their
site I'm not subscribed to them but you
know I got these and then I cancel my
subscription stuff and they're from the
brand city classifieds though really
cute and I think they go along well with
this color and jeans I just like it a
lot
okay so this is the last outfit and this
is the kind of fall inspired cooler
weather one I really like this outfit
too
I got this top from Express it's
actually pretty new and expressed I know
when I bought it he said that they just
put it out on the floor the day before
so this is sort of new it has the cold
shoulder top which I love and then also
has like this I don't know what would
you call it sort of silky esque I don't
know
material and then you have like this
sort of tan sand kind of color on bottom
so pretty I love it
I think it is just so feminine it'd be
great for fall and it just also has like
this band at the bottom so it's kind of
loose through here and I did just pair
it with a cami underneath I just paired
them with the same blue jeans I showed
you guys t.j.maxx and then these shoes
are the boots from Charlotte Russe
they're the ruched boots I do believe
and I know that Charlotte Russe still
has these I love these boots I had them
in black but I wore them out last winter
so I had to buy a new pair but I still
have the brown ones they're doing good
still so I love them I think they're
about $30 on Charlotte Russe calm so go
get you some so thank you guys so much
