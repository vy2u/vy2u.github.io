a back to school makeup look this is
definitely for girls that are more in
high school to college because I'm
wearing less temptation concealer stuff
like that I'm little guy went for it
it's kind of something that's gonna make
you look more awake because I know when
I was in high school I was late all the
time because I wanted my rest and I just
did not want to get up wanted to kind of
put together a look they'll help you
look more awake but it's still not too
overdone you just look you know put
together and also this look is
completely drugstore so I think you guys
will really like that but if you want to
switch things out with this tutorial you
definitely can like if you want to use a
BB cream instead of a foundation you
know go ahead and just switch it out if
you don't want to use eyeliner don't use
eyeliner it's completely up to you I
personally think this eyeshadow look
looks really great without eyeliner as
well so you could definitely try that
out if you want and by the way I'm sorry
I have been gone a week I know I hate
being gone for more than a few days like
for three or four days like not putting
up a video it drives me insane
I just love filming videos so I was
having withdrawals and I was like I need
to sit down and film a video so I have
to wear back to school videos I want to
do and that will be the end of my back
to school kind of series for this year
thank you guys for watching and let's go
ahead and get on to the tutorial so I'm
going to take the covergirl outlast stay
fabulous foundation and apply this in
dots all over my face and this is gonna
help make my face match my neck and body
and cover up some of my redness now like
I said in the beginning you can
definitely change out these products you
can use a BB cream or a concealer to
cover up any spots you know you won't
cover it up it's just up to you I chose
Chi's foundation now I'm going to be
using concealers the Revlon age defying
concealer in light medium focusing it
more in the inner corner of my eye
because that area is very very dark
again you don't use to have to use as
much concealer but when I was in school
I use this much and I'm blending it out
my finger and I'm just going to take my
sponge and blend it in even more and
this will help make it look really nice
and blended and seamless and just make
you look so much more awake it is in
same taking the NYX said it don't fret
at powder I'm just going to use this
underneath my eyes and on my face
because I do have oily skin so
gonna help keep my makeup in place and
help keep me shine free all day I really
do love this powder it's a great dupe
for the Make Up For Ever super matte
loose powder now this is optional I'm
going to fill in my brows with my Milani
brow fix kit I think mine's a medium you
don't have to do this if you don't want
to but I think it really helps frame the
face and it just looks really nice when
you have filled in brows I'm not doing
nothing too crazy just you know lightly
filling them in and now I'm taking this
color tattoo from Maybelline this is in
barely beige and I'm just going to apply
this all over my lid and then take any
excess up to my brow and this is going
to really lighten up our lid and also
it's going to prime our eyes so our eye
shadows stay on a lot longer throughout
the day if you have really oily eyelids
I would definitely still suggest a
proper eye primer but this works just as
well and now I'm gonna take this wet
while comfort zone palette in this
crease shade right here with my Sigma
brush I will have all the brushes and
stuff I used down below so I'm just
taking that color and putting it into my
crease I'm not being precise with there
or anything I just wanted to add a
little bit of dimension to the look and
I just love these two colors together I
think they look really really nice and
then I'm going to be taking my Z palette
that i depotted a bunch of white mom
eyeshadows in and taking the single
eyeshadow and brulee from wet-and-wild
I'm gonna put this underneath my brows
and also in the inner corners of my eye
this is an individual shadow that went
in marseilles and I highly recommend it
is such a pretty highlight color I love
it now I'm going in with my Rimmel
scandaleyes eyeliner in nude and I'm
gonna put this on my lower waterline
it's just gonna help brighten up the
eyes even more and then taking my
covergirl ink it eyeliner in black I'm
going to tightline which is I line the
upper waterline and that makes your
lashes look a lot fuller I also use my
Jordana liner my family liner actually
and I did do a winged eyeliner but
that's totally optional if you don't
want to do it you don't have to so then
I take my mainly need a big eyes mascara
and I use the bigger side for my top
lashes and the lower or the smaller wand
for my lower lashes then bronzing up the
skin I'm using NYC sunny bronzer I just
think this makes you look really healthy
I think bronzing is just a necessity
especially for me if I'm gonna do my
makeup so I'm just going to put the
where the Sun would naturally hit I'm
not contouring or anything like that and
then I'm going to be taking my favorite
blush ever this is the jordana blush in
touch a pink it looks so gorgeous and
natural is one of my all-time favorite
drugstore blushes ever then going in
with my Milani lipstick in new cream
this is a nude pink color you could skip
this if you would like but I thought it
was a really pretty color and then after
that I'm going to top it off with this
NYX butter gloss I forget the color but
I'll have everything down below if
you're interested and yeah that's pretty
much look I hope you guys enjoyed this
video please thumbs up if you did and I
will see you all in my next video bye
right here but after a few hours and I
still think it looks good I am just very
shiny and my t-zone is oil on my face is
it really bothering me so I'm watching a
lot on camera guys
Johnny and Ralph Lauren and retired and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
