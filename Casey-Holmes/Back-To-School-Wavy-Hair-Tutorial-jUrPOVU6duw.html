on this hair it's just really big wavy
hair I love this look I think it is so
cute especially for back-to-school I
think that these wings look even better
the next day they last for so long I can
go like three or four days with my hair
like this I love it and then if I want
to put it into like a hairstyle it looks
super cute as well and especially on
like the third or fourth day it looks a
little messy one that I used is actually
a new one this is from nume of course I
love new me and their products but this
is a new one that they came out with is
called the pentacle wand and what you
can do is lock it in place and you have
a 45 millimeter one so it's really big
it's the biggest one that they have and
then you can open it up and you have
your deep waver and what I love about
this waiver is it is nice and big so
it's not going to give you those little
bitty ways like you know how the
creepers were back in the day oh we
can't bring the hair back it's just not
going to work but I love this because I
feel like the big wavy hair will just
never go out of style because a lot of
people love this look it's just so
effortless but yet you look so gorgeous
and feminine at the same time and I
asked you guys on Instagram because I
posted a picture on there asking you
guys if you wanted a video on it and a
lot of you said yes I will leave a
coupon code for you guys down below if
you are interested in this I asked new
me if we could have one for you guys and
they did supply you guys with another
$110 off this one so if you want that
coupon I will leave it down below so if
you want to see how I got this hair then
just keep watching okay getting started
I just split my hair in two sections and
I'm just going to brush it out make sure
I don't have any knots and like I said
in the beginning if you want to section
your hair like in multiple sections go
ahead but this is just what's easiest
for me and it takes me about 15 minutes
to do this in all so I take you know
pretty large sections it kind of varies
whatever I'm feeling in the moment and
then I just clamp the wand down and hold
it for a few seconds and then release
and then clamp back down and where you
want to start is where your last wave
ends so it's really easy what I like to
do is kind of lift the wand up a little
bit and then when I sort of pull through
I feel my wave kind of come out of the
curling iron
and then I clamp again but the easiest
way is to just see where your last wave
ended and then start back again so
wherever it curved down you want to
clamp right there at the very end so
it's pretty easy once you you know get
used to it it all kind of sinks in
together even if you don't clamp it down
right it'll still look really great
because it's just wavy hair so now I'm
showing you guys how to the top half of
my hair I start about an inch and a half
away from my root and I tilt the wand
down like my palm going towards the
floor I don't know I just feel like that
makes a better look to the top of my
head I don't know I don't like clamping
the wand really close to the root I
think it's just a little too much for me
so I just like to leave a little bit of
hair straight before I start clamping it
down
then I just do that whole process on the
other side of my head it's really simple
I'm not precise about it I just pick a
section clamp it down and I'm done and
then I'll show you guys here in a second
what I do when I've completed my whole
head so after you're done with that you
just want to take your fingers and run
it through your hair and just kind of
loosen up the curls I don't recommend
using a brush I've done that before and
it makes you look very frizzy so just
take your fingers kind of tossing it
around just to loosen up all the waves
you created and I didn't use any
hairspray because I didn't feel like I
needed it since it does last so long on
my hair and that's pretty much it I hope
you guys enjoyed this video please
thumbs up for more back to school videos

like me to do videos on then just leave
it in the comments below and thank you
guys for watching I'll see you my next
video bye
