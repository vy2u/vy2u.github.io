going to show you how to get ready in 15
minutes when you are running late for
school we're going to have drugstore
makeup and affordable clothing in this
video so I hope you enjoy it we're going
to go from this which is not so excited
just roll out of bed kind of look to a
nice casual cute look for school so the
first thing I'm going to do is show you
guys my timer because I am going to be
tithing this so we're going to go ahead
and start that little timer thingy
whatever you want to call it and the
first thing I'm taking is my batiste dry
shampoo I'm running on third or fourth
day here in this video so I want to
minimize the oil as much as I can this
is an amazing dry shampoo I highly
recommend it especially if you have very
oily hair so we're going to put this all
throughout rub it in and then we're
going to clip our hair back and let that
powder just soak in and get the oil
while we do our makeup first thing we're
taking is the L'Oreal miracle blur this
is a really nice product especially if
you have oily skin it makes you matte
and then it also creates a really nice
space for your foundation foundation I'm
using the cover will outlast three and
one my favorite drugstore foundation
ever I highly recommend it I'm using my
fingers because this is the fastest way
I feel like to apply foundation just
make sure you keep some makeup wipes on
hand so you can wipe your hands off
right when you're done applying this on
your face for concealer I'm using the
Revlon age defying concealer I think is
in light/medium and I'm going to put
this underneath my eyes in a small
triangle not too much and drag some onto
my lid to prime the eye and I'm going to
use my finger first to help blend it out
and then I do go in with a brush the
f-86 from sigma and i blend it out as
well just to make sure it's nice and
seamless now to set all my makeup I'm
taking the NYX stay matte but not flat
powder foundation I forget the color but
all the colors and stuff will be below
in the bottom bar I'm going to use this
helps keep me matte and also adds a
little bit more coverage as well so if
you have any problem areas this is a
great product now I'm taking the NYX
matte bronzer again I don't remember the
color but I'll put it below I didn't use
blush in this video I decided to use
bronzer instead because if I had a
choice it would definitely be bronzer
but use what you would like to use if
you want to use blush and said and go
right ahead but
I'm a bronzer fanatic so I had to use
that and now we're taking this
Maybelline quad it's so pretty
I'm taking the second to lightest shade
and I'm applying this all over the lid
with my fingers just so I can get this
on really nice and quickly and then I'm
taking the lightest shade in the palette
and I'm going to put this in the inner
corners of my eyes just to brighten it
up and make me look a little bit more
awake these colors are very pigmented
and I highly recommend all the colors
now taking this wet wild palette with
the shade I'm showing you now I'm going
to apply this in the crease you can get
this pout online I'll put the link below
it's one of my favorites the greed and
vanity is hands-down my favorite wet
wild palette
ever and then I'm going in with this
shade from the palette I'm going to use
that as my highlight shade now I'm
taking my Milani brow fix kit I'm just
going to fill in my brows and you don't
have to do this if you don't want to but
I personally like to do it because it
just frames your face a little bit more
and you don't have to be precise or
anything just you know kind of fill in
the hairs where you see it's sparse and
now what I'm doing is taking my eyelash
curler and I'm just going to curl my
lashes and then I'm going to take these
two liners
one of them's for Rimmel and it's a nude
shade and this is great to brighten up
the eyes and the other one I'll be using
is my covergirl ink it so I use the
Rimmel one on my lower waterline and
then I use the covergirl ink it the
black liner on my upper waterline to
tight line now I'm taking the L'Oreal
shocking extensions mascara and applying
that on my top and bottom lashes and
then for lipgloss I will be taking this
NYX butter gloss I highly recommend them
for school they're not sticky and then
give you that you know amount of color
that you want on your lips and it's just
not too much so the makeups done and
we've got eight minutes down so now it's
time for hair I'm going to brush out my
hair and get rid of this residue from
the dry shampoo and after you're done
doing that we're going to go ahead and
start putting our hair in a ponytail
getting it ready for the bun and for me
I don't do this perfectly I've set it
quite a few times but I like my buns to
be a little bit more on the messy side
but I am going to take a brush and brush
out the size just to make sure I'll have
any crazy crazy
bumps and I do the same and the back as
well I just like a little bit more
volume in my bun and you know I don't
want it to look too sleek because I
don't really like the slicked back look
but you can do whatever you prefer so
I'm taking this pony up to my crown and
I'm just going to tie it tightly so it
stays all day I loop it around about
three times and then I tighten it again
once it's nice and secure and then brush
out the ponytail so I have no nods okay
so now I'm going to take these sock bun
maker and I'm going to put my ponytail
right through the center of it and just
pull it all the way through and then
basically you want to waterfall your
hair around that soft bun maker and once
you have it evenly like spread out so
you can't see the little sock bun thing
you're going to take an elastic and
you're just going to secure it in place
now this is a great technique for if you
are having a hard time with rolling your
hair down to be a sock bun you could do
this as well and it's also great for
shorter hair so I'll leave a link down
below two of my other bun videos where I
did the sock bun where I rolled it down
this was just a different way to get it
put up like this so now I just wrap my
hair around the bun and I bobby pin it
in place of course if you have shorter
hair you won't have as much to bobby pin
and it's pretty easy so if you have
short hair I would definitely recommend
doing it this way but I love this look
and I love the fact that the hairs right
underneath the bun I just think it looks
so pretty so this is what it looks like
I just pull a few pieces down by my face
just to kind of add to the messiness of
it and then that's pretty much it for
the bun so now we are down and we have
13 minutes so that means we have two
minutes left to get dressed which is not
hard at all so we're going to change out
of this little jammies ensemble and get
into something else that's really nice
and affordable so my kimono is from
forever 21 my tank top is an H&amp;amp;M basic
so it's from H&amp;amp;M and my pants are from
forever 21 they're my favorites I love
love love getting pants from forever 21
they fit so well and my jewelry the gold
rings are from forever 21 as well as my
little gold stud earring
and then my sandals are from Charlotte
Russe they're nude and they work
perfectly with this outfit so I hope you

thumbs up if you enjoyed it and don't
forget to share it with your friends and
