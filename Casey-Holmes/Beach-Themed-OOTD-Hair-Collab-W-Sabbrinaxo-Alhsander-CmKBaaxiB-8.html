a kind of beach themed collab I'm doing
this with Sabrina EXO and alh Sanders
which is Sabrina and Ashley I love them
today at their videos are always amazing
and they're super gorgeous I will have
both of their videos linked right here
the entire time of mine whatever we all
put on our videos
I will make sure to link both of them
right here for the full length of this
video I did the hair and an outfit
everybody did an outfit I'm pretty sure
yeah
so everybody did an outfit Sabrina did
the makeup and an outfit and then Ashley
is doing a what's in my beach bag or
what she kind of keeps in her beach bag
and an outfit at the end as well so if
you're interested in seeing how I got
this hair and what exactly I am wearing
then just keep watching and don't forget
to go check out my girls I love them to
death and I know you guys will
absolutely love their videos so don't
forget to go subscribe to them and I
will see you all in the next video bye
so what you're gonna need is anything
that's going to create ways I love it
didn't heat waves straighter and I'm
taking two dry shampoos one from Rio
Terra and one from Reston also you will
need this red pin white black tin or
whatever kind of spray you want and then
I'm also taking the got to be very an
angel you too protective and can Bobby
so I'm taking this red cream powder
fresh and I'm gonna spray this all over
my roof I have really oily hair so I
like to combine two don't ask me why I
just do
but the bioterror ones really great by
itself as well but I just really liked
do you reckon one also
and you can find the bioterror one at
your local Sally's for I think about 10
dollars and my hair is actually set that
day here and it was pinstripe the night
before so that's what I'm working with
so you want to rub it all in and you
want to kind of get any spot to doing
this I love this stuff it's so so so so
so good and then you're just going to
want to brush out your hair to get any
excess that might be going around out
then I'm gonna spray petite detective
all over my hair and this clip I'm gonna
leave this front section right around my
face down and I'm gonna click the rest
of the hair back I'll just make it a lot
easier when we start braiding and I'm
not the best freighter but I try my best
um so I'm just gonna start from the top
and create one full braid and then start
adding pieces as I go down I know it
sounds dumb but I guess they call this
like the French braid I've never done a
French braid or anything like that but I
really like the way this braid looks it
just kind of actually thing extra to the
very simple these ways we'll be doing
and this hairstyle and what I'm wearing
in this video it's definitely what I was
wearing on to the beach definitely so
this stuff is out there and I know look
who's here I want to place it then we
put the rest of hair back and use a
bobby pins and I placed these in X so
they're gonna stay all day long
now we're gonna type hug it Lucy is just
a little bit then take the goody weight
data and I'm gonna start taking sections
of my hair
these are actually fairly large sections
this is just a really simple work to do
it sent me about 10 minutes to pull the
hair but I just you don't want to look
perfect this is just a wavy deep swirl
it's nothing that's petite uniformed and
really nice-looking so again I am taking
very very large sections and you just
want to do this all over your hair
and I kind of went with this hairstyle
in this outfit because I like simple
stuff and if I'm at the beach this is
what I would do something simple quick
and easy I think I love it so much so
I'm just gonna kind of touch up any
spots and also run my fingers in my hair
and I'm going to take this backsplash
Tim can reckon I love this stuff it kind
of acts as a hairspray but it really
helps kind of mesh some curls together
and just I know it looks really really
great I don't use any hairspray this
video if the wax lab is the only
finishing spray that I do use so this is
what this side looks like then you're
just gonna do the same exact thing on
the other side taking pretty large
sections and killing them around the
wave creator I also have a summer hair
tutorial that doesn't require as much
heat I will link that somewhere in this
video and you can also do what I did in
that video the night before and then
just feel Restless to your hair so I'm
gonna spray the righthand wax blast all
of my hair again and what it looks like
so let's go to the outfit I'm wearing a
romper from Belk I absolutely love it
it's so easy just to throw on and go
really cute and bright so it's kind of
this ruffle an elastic band at the waist
if you want you could totally add a belt
but I wouldn't do that
mm so I'm going to take these a
Charlotte Russe sandals I love them
super spines up really cute
and that's one
also a having sunglasses they're from
Target and one so deftly I hope you guys
enjoy this video and I will see you all
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
