a first impressions review on my Beauty
Blender now I have you know wet it so
it's a lot better than what it was but
this is what I'm gonna be doing a review
on a lot of you said you wanted to see
it styles like okay cuz I wanted to do
it anyways but mine just came in a set
if you watched my haul you saw it but it
came with this beauty blender cleanser
which I'm really happy it did that's the
main reason why I bought it with the
cleanser because I didn't know what else
I would clean it with and I didn't know
if it was like actually deep clean it so
that's why I got this because I knew it
was for the Beauty Blender and this was
crap like 30 something dollars I'll put
the exact description down below I got
mine off of Sephora so this hand allure
Beauty Expert the Editors Choice Award
that's pretty cool it's latex-free if
you're wondering there's really not much
to this other than you're supposed to
damp it before you apply your foundation
and you're supposed to pat on your
foundation with this I know there's much
a Beauty Blender dupes out there but
I've heard there's just nothing like the
original so I'm really excited to try
this out I'm gonna use it with my
foundation and a couple concealers today
to see how it works so I'm going to go
ahead and put my makeup forever matte
velvet plus foundation and number 30 on
the back of my hand and also since it's
damp they say that it doesn't waste a
lot of product like it won't seep into
the sponge a lot so I just have a bare
naked face all I have on is moisturizer
and I'm gonna take the end I'm just
gonna Pat it on supposed to like bounce
it on Pat it on whatever they all want
to call it
so far I'm liking it it's giving just
like a nice kind of dewy finish which
you can fix that with a setting powder
of course but it doesn't look cakey and
it gave really nice coverage like it's
covering my blemish pretty well I also
like the way this feels on my skin like
I feel like in the morning cuz I'd rinse
divine under cold water and I feel like
in the morning this would really feel
awesome on the skin because it's just
like it's not super cold but it feels
really really good
and I really want to try this with the
Revlon Colorstay foundation because I've
heard it amazing
I just heard such positive things on
this Beauty Blender so I had to try it
okay so that's pretty much it for
foundation it gave a really nice like
flawless coverage and it doesn't look
cakey at all really liking it and now
I'm just going to apply some concealer
underneath my eyes I'm using the
maybelline instant age rewind a dark
circle I'm gonna place this don't worry
this is really not a heavy concealer
then we're gonna take the pointed side
I'm just going to pretty much do the
same thing this gets underneath the eyes
lends it out really really nicely I like
that
of course it won't get like to the inner
corner of your eyes so I'll just have to
use my finger there but otherwise it
moves it out really nicely
I feel like if you thought your face
makeup was cakey you can always just
rinse this and like taking over your
foundation like after you've applied it
and put no foundation on it just have
the damp sponge and just tap it I think
it would really help make your
foundation not look so cakey if you felt
like it was like too crazy that day or
something that would be a really cool
idea but so far I'm liking it I like the
way it applies I never thought I would
like a sponge I'm gonna apply a little
bit of my dermablend concealer and
stable just to my redness a little bit
because my skin is acting up lately so
I'm taking just the bottom a little bit
down there I'm just going to place this
my redness so things just have it this
concealers a little darker so it kind of
helps make the foundation that look so
pale
okay so so far I really like it I feel
like it's really great at blending out
under-eye concealer but I would much
rather you know go in with my brush and
just Pat it in and be a lot quicker and
it gets right into my inner corner
quickly I'm excited about this little
guy this is what my skin looks like just
a nice kind of flawless covered look at
my Christmas background isn't it cute I
love it but of course it's 11:46 I'm
just gonna go do some errands and
Christmas shopping and I'll be back in a
few hours let you guys know how I feel
like it wore throughout the day hi guys
so I just got home from shopping a
couple hours ago and I've been like
Christmas wrapping or know I've been
wrapping Christmas gifts it's the bow on
the top of my head I'm like in the
Christmas spirit right now and just like
an awesome mood I had to pause my
Pandora cuz I was like getting down to
some Christmas music but um I have a
special guest let me show you
her.she her.she tell everyone hello say
look at my dirty nose oh she's bashful
are you bashful today are you bashful
today pretty girl
no she's so sweet she's always on
Instagram I'm always taking pictures of
her I get like she's got dirt on her
nose it's evidence
grin sweat that off her mom gets home so
she won't know you're digging so my skin
still looks really good I'm very
impressed
my foundation hasn't really wore off
throughout the day which I really won't
have that problem and Make Up For Ever
foundation sometimes applying it
differently can make your foundation
wear differently I never thought I would
honestly like applying my foundation
with a sponge but I never thought of
doing it with a damp sponge but this is
awesome I really really love it so far
my skin still looks flawless so my face
is not cakey at all hasn't been kicking
it all day I feel like it applies the
foundation full coverage but it still
looks like skin oh I don't even tell you
guys what time it was it's 6:18 oh and I
got a new case
I got it from Macy's they're having 25%
off Michael Kors from what I saw
so I snatched this up real quick anyways
totally off topic I'm really really
really loving this so far though just
even from first applying it till now I
love it like applying it it was so easy
so quick and even just blending out
concealer I still would probably rather
blend out my concealer with a brush but
this is still just super super easy
doesn't soak up a lot of product at all
I still had a bunch on the back of my
hand I could have used but this is
really awesome I'm loving it I love the
way my foundation looks hours later
don't forget to check my video at the
end of the month when I do a review on
all my FIS you will get to find out what
I think of the products at the end of
the month I'll be able to use them for
that whole period times and still
continuously using the things that I do
FIF saw on I haven't tried the dupe so
I'm gonna have to go get a dupe and try
it out and see what the difference is
but so far everybody says that these are
a lot better than those but I'm not
gonna be biased I'm gonna try it I hope
