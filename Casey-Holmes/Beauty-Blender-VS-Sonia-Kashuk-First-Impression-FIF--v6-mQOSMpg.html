(F.I.F)</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2013-01-18</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-v6-mQOSMpg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">this is what it looks like it just comes
in a little thing like this and system
you cash it on side
this was $12.99 at Target now I've
already damped this sponge and I can
already tell you it is a lot more dense
and I haven't even wet the Beautyblender
and it's the same size as this Honey
Kashuk one so the Beauty Blender gets a
lot bigger and it's just it's not as
dense so that's right off the bat what I
can tell and I did damn it because
you're supposed to date the sponge
before you apply the foundation because
that just helps it go on more flawlessly
so the foundation I'm gonna be using
today is to make up forever matte belt
plus now I know that this is definitely
a different shape but you can always use
the end same way and just Pat it in and
do the same thing as I do my Beauty
Blender and I'm not gonna do it update
because this is basically just a first
impression on if it applies the same way
as a Beauty Blender if it covers the
same way that's pretty much what this
video is on so just taking the end and
then always just dab for spots on my
face wow this is a lot harder and I feel
like I'm punching myself in the face
slice isn't gonna blend really well
encounters it's not pouncing on my skin
because it is way to dance like if I
want to pass it I'm gonna hurt myself so
I'm like lightly tapping it yeah this
isn't blending it very well just try
using the tip oh my god no not to hang
out well I feel like have to use more
product too because it kind of just
keeps everything in the same place so
you kind of have to just read it out
yourself the Beautyblender just it's so
big and easy to use it's it's nothing
like this if you have this on you cash
it mule in it or you've tried it and you
hate it and that's why you don't want to
try the view regular beauty blender now
you need to try the regular beauty
blender because there's nothing like
this I'm actually about to go wet my
Beauty Blender and fix this because it
is not letting it in well like these see
this you hear that that's ridiculous
Beauty Blender does not sound like that
it doesn't feel like that either it
feels really good on the skin and it's
not like you're punching yourself in the
face with a sponge yeah I'm gonna have
to get the beauty blender to come to the
rescue
I mean it did spread out the foundation
and blend it out but it's not as
flawless as the video burner I kind of
feel like this one just puts the
foundation in one place and doesn't
spread it out like you have to add more
product to help spread it out so okay
now that I wet the Beauty Blender you
can see the difference it's a lot bigger
and it's just fuller and it's just
softer this one it's like you gotta use
some muscle but this one is just like
nice such a huge difference I can't even
believe how that turned out I was hoping
it would be at least good or at least
soft you know like I figured
okay the probably the problem I'll have
with it is the shape of it I don't like
the shape nope I don't like it it's too
dense okay so if you guys want my honest
opinion you probably already know I'm
gonna say at the end of this video this
is a no I don't like it I regret buying
it because it's nothing like the Beauty
Blender I was hoping it was at least
gonna be soft
it's not even soft I mean it's nothing
like it it's so insane how dense it is
and it's just not it's it's just not the
same and you can see the Beauty Blender
covers a lot more then the Sonia Kashuk
one does so I'm not liking it I kind of
wish I would have kept the receipt so I
could try to return it or something
because I mean this is it was $12.99 so
I mean you could spend the extra ten to
fifteen bucks and just get this little
guy and he'll be awesome so yeah I don't
like this it is nothing like the Beauty
Blender they were all right when they
said it was not like the Beauty Blender
cuz it's really not so I hope you guys
enjoy this I hope it was informative and
a little bit helpful you already tell
what else didn't think about it my first
impression putting it on it was just it
wasn't meant to be I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you
guys in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
