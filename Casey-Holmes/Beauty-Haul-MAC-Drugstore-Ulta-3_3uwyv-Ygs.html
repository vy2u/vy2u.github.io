beauty haul these are just some beauty
items I picked up the past week and I
thought I would go ahead and show you so
I'm really gonna show you the things I
got from Mac and some of these things
you've probably seen like in my recent
tutorial that I did but um yeah so let's
get started so the first thing is from
Mac I got the mac fix+
I've been wanting this for awhile and I
finally just went ahead and picked it up
and I also got a new blush this reminds
me so much of my loved rush blush but
it's definitely different it definitely
has like a pink burgundy orange
undertone but this one's embracing and I
thought this one will be really pretty
for fall I really really like it it's a
sheer tone shimmer but with a really
light hand it's gonna look so pretty and
I just really really like it a lot so
that's all that I got from Mac from Ulta
I got three new brushes they're real
technique brushes I love when beauty
gurus come out with things I'm all about
supporting other girls so I had to pick
some of these up especially since
everybody raised about them so this one
is the powder brush then we got the
expert face brush and the blush brush so
that's those they're really soft and I
can't wait to wash them so I can really
start using them and then I had gotten
three color tattoos but I did not
realize that I picked up another bad to
the bronze which of course I already
have so I gave that one to my mom and
and I picked up two other ones from the
newest collection this one is barely
beige and then the Maybelline Color
tattoos don't know if I said that and
then there's this one which is a mossy
green so that's that and then I got a
few things from NYX I just got four
pigments Jade pearl you've seen this one
it's the glitter mania pigment and this
is in blue then we've got mocha pearl
which is really pretty and then we got
orange pearl and I also picked up three
of the new liners that they came out
with they're called the glam liner aqua
luxe waterproof and I got the Zora one
which you guys have probably seen
already
it's just a really pretty blue color and
what I also love about these is that not
only do they have the color right here
but they have them on the tip as well
and I got Lagoon which is like a really
pretty green color really pretty I like
this one a lot and then I got the purple
one which is just called glam purple I
think they all have flame in front of it
yeah they all have flame in front of it
so this is just called purple I find
like I feel like this one's a little bit
more sheer but it's still really pretty
and I like it so that's the purple one
very pretty colors okay and then I got
two new concealers I got the dermablend
one which you will see my upcoming face
routine which I will post after this
video but this is what it looks like I
got it in sable and I really really like
it especially for the redness on my face
and then I got the amazing cosmetics
amazing concealer and this is in light
golden really really really love that
and then I got the healthy sexy hair soy
try wheat leave-in conditioner I've
heard so many good things about this but
the main reason why I just finally
picked it up is because it was on sale
for $9.99 which I thought was a steal
for this 16.9 fluid ounce bottle I
thought that was amazing and I love the
nozzle on I've used it a few times
already
and I think it's just great it's a soy
try wheat leave-in conditioner and I've
heard so many people talk about this and
love it and I was so happy to finally
pick that up so I'm going to say yes the
other day and I went to pick up some
body wash or whatever but I also picked
up the stream matte powder I heard
Marisa lace talked about this and then
once I saw missglamorazzi video I was
like okay I have to go just go and pick
it up because a lot of things that she's
recommended I went and picked out or I
went and picked up and I actually really
loved it so I really trust her opinion
but this is the Maybelline Dream matte
powder it is in medium zero-one sand and
it looks really light especially when
you swatch it on your finger but I feel
like it's sort of a transparent powder
it's not really going to give you a lot
of color payoff but it's really great to
keep in your purse and I've been trying
it out I'm not going to
I love this more than the cover tops tan
powder yet because I'm still trying it
out because that powder is like my
favorite from Physicians Formula but
we'll see I think this is cute and I
like the fact that it has a little puff
because you never know you might leave a
brush at home by accident and need a
puff so that's really nice and so today
I went to two drugstore places I'm going
to show you CVS first so I just picked
up some more cotton rounds from CVS just
for my favorite toner which if you don't
know I'll link my August favorites down
below and you can go check that out
Revlon and Maybelline where a buy one
get one half off so from Revlon I just
got two nail polishes I got the rich
raspberry which is a really pretty
burgundy kind of color and I just love
this one because it really screams fall
I really like this and this one's my
favorite I'm gonna paint this on my nose
as soon as possible this is called
amethyst yes and that's what it looks
like I don't think it's picking up
they're really nice like glitter
shimmers or whatever in this nail polish
but this is a beautiful beautiful nail
polish and if you've never tried the
color stain nail polishes you really
need to because I can go a week without
a chip like I know for sure it's a week
without a chip for me so I highly
recommend them I think they're really
awesome so love that and then from a
lane I just got three more color tattoos
I know it's so crazy but I picked up one
more from the newest collection that I
didn't get it Alta and it's the rich
mahogany so it's a really pretty brown
color I like this one a lot and then I
also picked up two from the permanent
collection I've been eyeing these for
forever seriously these - I just wanted
for so long and I'm like just pick them
up I can't figure out if I want edgy
emerald yet because it's so pretty but I
don't know if I want yet but this is
tenacious teal and this one is painted
purple I think it's such a beautiful
beautiful purple love this and then I
know a lot of people say they hate this
blush but honest to god I think the only
reason why I even picked it up is
because I want to feel the blush so it's
the dream bouncy blush from Maybelline I
got mine in a plum wine which is pretty
dark and I know a bunch of people say
that
they don't like these because they're
not payment and stuff like that but if
this isn't pigment enough for me
CBS has an amazing return policy so I
could just go and return it
Walgreens kind of gives me no hassle but
I know CVS is amazing with returns so if
it sucks I'll let you know and I also
had a two dollar off coupon for Rimmel
so I got this quad this is in precious
crown
I've actually been eyeing this for a
while as well as like a dark green a
dark purple a dark blue and it looks
like a black so I got this pretty cheap
I think so then I went to wallet and I
just picked up some more face wipes
because I don't have any more and I kind
of liked trying them out but I get
really nervous when trying new face
wipes out because I saw them break me
out this is a I'm probably gonna butcher
this loom lumen a Finland sensitive
touch gentle cleansing wipes I picked
these up because they're for sensitive
skin and also because it won the 2011
Allure Beauty Awards so I thought that
was great so I just picked these up let
you know what I think and then I picked
this dry shampoo up because I purchased
it if you follow me on Instagram if you
don't you should I'll put my name down
below but on Instagram I bought some new
hair products and this is one of the
products that I purchased I've been
loving it I had a tag around it that
said two dollars off once you like right
when you purchase it so these are like
six dollars in something cents apiece so
I think I got this for like four bucks
and I just wanted to back up so I
thought that was great okay and at
Walgreens I saw these wet and wild
little individual shadows hanging up and
we all know what mild is pretty amazing
if you haven't checked them out you
really should because their shadows are
so pigmented and so are their blushes
and oh I didn't know they were cruelty
free how cute I didn't know that so
there's an extra bonus but I picked
these up because they were $1.99 and
these shadows look a lot bigger than the
end of the individual shadows that they
usually have so that's a pretty big to
me that's a lot bigger maybe I'm just
crazy I'm probably crazy I got the
colors stage-dive which I'm obsessed
with I love this blue how pretty
can't really get the gist of how
gorgeous it is but it's really pretty
and then also sell out which is really
pretty got my favorite gum dentine pure
palma and then revlon was buy one get
one half off at walgreens which i should
have thought about that because i got
three things and I could have just
totally skipped this eyeshadow but I
went ahead and picked it up this is the
Revlon diamond lust and plum galaxy and
you can't really get the gist of how
beautiful this is but it has like it's
like a purple glitter shadow with some
pink glitter some blue glitter and
purple glitter so it's very very pretty
then I also got another Revlon Colorstay
I just went down to shades so the really
the one I use now is fresh beige and I
went down to medium bang-on just in case
I get lighter
I do self tan so I pretty much plan on
staying these two colors for the fall
and winter time and then I saw this now
I'm not usually into like eyeshadow
palettes like this I don't know um I
really like this one this one just
caught my eye and this was in the new
like it was in the Revlon setup with a
new product so this is called beach
beauty and the main reason why I got it
was for that color right there but look
at how gorgeous the rest of the colors
are like the gray the black the cream
the brown I really liked it and I was
thinking you know it's really a gorgeous
palette so why not so I picked that up
too and then the last thing I got was
this Maybelline mineral power powder
foundation um I don't know if this is my
color but I got creamy natural which is
light five it's like the darkest light I
was so annoyed picking out my color
because I cannot figure out what color I
was um you know you look in the pan and
it looks one color and then they all
look the same way I don't know it was
very hard picking out eco hopefully it
matches if not hopefully Walgreens
doesn't give me a hard time about
returning or exchanging so but I really
wanted to try this out I've heard so
many great things and it's oil free talc
free fragrance free so so that is
everything I got I hope you guys enjoyed
