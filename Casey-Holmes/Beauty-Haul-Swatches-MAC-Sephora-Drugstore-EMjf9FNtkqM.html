a beauty haul I've got some stuff from
like the drugstore and Sephora and Mac
then he wanted to show you guys so I'm
just gonna go ahead and get started so
we did order from cherry culture calm I
have ordered from them before and I
really like that site they have a bunch
of like it discontinued stuff on there
if you you know they discontinued it in
stores they'll usually have it on that
site and they have a bunch of different
other types of drugstore brands that
sometimes you know you can't find in
your drugstore and they also have like a
couple higher-end products as well so I
just already a few things from here and
the first thing I got this is not
drugstore it's more high end but the
happies at cherry culture star just
picked it up it's the original Beauty
Blender and I just went ahead and bought
another pack and this is a pack of two
because I love mine but mine is kind of
getting worn out a little bit it's still
going really great but I don't like to
clean it like every time I use it so I
figured I'd just get two more and kind
of switch all three of them out and just
start washing them at different times
but yep I just got another pack of the
beauty blenders and then I got some
false lashes because I've been really
trying to experiment more with false
lashes lately
so I just picked up six little excessive
but the first four are from the Ardell
natural line and I've got two of the the
whispies which the whiskies are one of
my favorites if they they look really
pretty
so that's what the whiskies look like
just got two packs of those and then I
also got the fairies and they look like
that you can see I hope you can see
they're a little bit I mean they're not
as whisky as the dummies they're kind of
like the demi wispies just not as thick
that's what the berries look like and
then I don't remember working these but
they're called the hotties these are
very long and dramatic so I don't know
when
he's probably just in a video or
tutorial or something or a night out but
got those and then got to these are the
same kind from the Ardell fashion lashes
and these are the 120 Demi and these are
these are kind of like the whiskey's but
they're like they're whiskey's but they
have shape to them and they're a little
bit thicker let's see where's the
whiskey job these are some of my
favorites though you can see the
difference there the way space just look
more natural and just a lot more flared
out and then the Demi's kind of have
just know they're a little bit thicker
and they're more dramatic so just got
some moves and then moving on I got some
Jordana trotters because a lot of people
have been talking about Jordana lately
but my Walgreens doesn't carry Jordana
so that kind of sucks but I just want em
to feel some things from them on the
site and the first thing I got because
of Loren beauty and she has amazing
lashes she has really long natural
lashes as well
and she used to use this all the time
I'm not sure she still uses it now but
it's the Jordana best lash extreme
volumizing mascara and keep in mind this
Jordana stuff is like $2 1/2 $3 they're
definitely not over for I don't believe
but that's like a couple dollars it's
not expensive at all and then I also got
this liquid liner from Jordana it's
called the semi-permanent liquid liner
and I'm excited to try baby
I actually swatch throwing it earlier
and it ain't going nowhere which is
great for me and it does have a really
nice brush I needed a new liner and this
is like what 2 bucks or something and it
has a really really skinny brush tip so
I'm excited to try this out seems like
so far it's gonna be a really great
liner and it's super super black I can't
wait to try that and then I also got a
lip liner this is one that Carli bybel
talks about all the time it's called
tawny and I really wanted to try
something Jordana's lip liners but again
I don't have it near me so I just
ordered this online and
I ordered because I kinda want to try
some NYX lip liners but I thought right
Ani because I've always I didn't for so
long and then I got three blushes from
Jordana and I really love the packaging
of our blushes I think they're so cute
they just come in like a little tin like
this and they just screw off so this one
is called Redwood and it's just
basically a red color it's is really
pretty super pigmented
and I also got the color coral sandy
beach these are very velvety very soft
very pigmented I do highly recommend
these I mean they're gorgeous
so there's coral sandy beach I just love
this packaging I don't know what it is
about twisting it on an office I love it
and the last one I got is such a pink
looks like that and again super
pigmented and pretty very wearable so
that's such a peek and then I gots the
next product I did get some more of the
butter glosses I just got a backup of my
creme brulee and I also got the color
apple strudel which is just a really
pretty coral pink it's so pretty
but that's what it looks like right
there again that was Apple school and
again another one is this is an eclair
this is definitely like a mafia panic so
I'm excited to try this one where I just
swatch it up that one right yeah and
then from NYX I also got this which I'm
really excited about it's the NYX matte
finish setting spray they also have one
that's too dewy so if you want like a
dewy skin you can get that one but I'm
on the matte side so I got the matte
finishing one and it says it's long
lasting so I'm very excited to try this
out I hope it's as great as it seems
cross my fingers on that one and then
they also have the next a matte but not
flat I got this one because
love Melissa Michelle and it makes you
feature this in her favorites video but
I love the packaging of this I just
think the colors a little too light for
me again this is in soft beige so I'm
gonna have to go up a color but oh my I
was like a little puffed in there Oh
cute but yeah so it looks like it's a
really nice pattern very soft and feel
like Bufton in the skin is yeah it's
definitely a powder foundation so I'm
still excited to try that out and then
the last two things that I got are this
blush from Milani this is in coralina I
think I used to rave about this a lot
but I can't remember but I picked it
back up because I don't have in my
collection and I've been really loving
the Milani baked blush it and the line
thing I got is a China Glaze nail
polishes in aqua Delek right yes aqua
deli just looks like this I think
they're just from an old collection I
can't remember but like I said they
carry discontinued stuff on that site
and it's awesome now I'm going on to a
Mac and Sephora I'm just going to go
ahead and start with Mac first thing is
I did get four new eyeshadows I got the
color wedge also that coppering just
like this also got the color crystal
avalanche which I plan on using for a
highlight and then I got the color
orange because I've been loving orange
and red shadows anything of that sort so
I just putting that orange next thing I
got were two brushes I think it's a
match
two on two which looks like this Sigma
II 15 honey's on my brows but I'm really
excited to use this one because I've
heard it's great for pigments so I
picked that up and then I also got this
liner brush this would be 210 seen a lot
of people use this and their liner is
always super flicked out at the end so
I'm excited to try this little guy out
hopefully it gives me the same effect
and let's see the next thing is a pan
blush because I need to fill up my blush
palette so this is the match your tongue
blush and peaches
and let's see you this is just what it
looks like really pretty color and it is
a sheer tone I don't know if I said that
or not
and it's right there
so got that and then I got this because
of Jaclyn hill this is a pigment in tan
from Mac and it literally is a gorgeous
color like if I even swatched it and you
showed you on camera it doesn't do it
justice like it is so pretty it just
looks amazing so can't wait to use that
it's my first little Mac pigment and one
of these little containers and I really
like the packaging of this and then I
got a lip gloss this is the Viva Glam
Nicki gloss this is just the original
and I wanted to try the lipstick that
the lipstick seems like it's just going
to be too much for me so I just want to
know about the lip gloss and its really
pretty very very pigmented I think it's
going great in the summertime so can't
wait to try them out and then it last
but not least we have some stuff for
items I did get two samples of the Kat
Von D locket tattoo foundation and then
I just got some newer things to try out
so the first thing is this Sephora I
makeup remover I wanted to try this
because a lot of people talk about it
and I'm gonna be wearing waterproof
mascara and the summer time just so it
doesn't smudge or anything so I'm
excited to try this little guy out
everybody says it's amazing so that was
only like six bucks too and then I also
got an SSD lift arm and very first one
this one's in nylon and it's very bright
I also got my first little buxom lip
gloss and I did not know this was a
plumping lip gloss which I usually don't
go for cuz half the time I don't really
like the feeling of the
being but I didn't know it until I get
home and tried it on I was like what's
going on and I read this I bought of
stuff like oh ok but it's super cute
packaging again this is in white Russian
and it doesn't have that much color
payoff but it's just a nice gloss to
kind of top off any lipstick with so
that's it right there it doesn't really
show up that color on your lips I think
it's just good to put over and then I
got a Tarte blush I've been wanting this
one it's in tipsy just a really pretty
kind of coral shade corally orange
that's what it looks like and these
Tarte Amazonian clay blushes are amazing
and it will stay on for forever
so that's right there I'm a blush aholic
I have a problem with blush I just I
love it so much last two products I got
for are from NARS and this one I used to
use all the time because I used to use
the NARS sheer matte foundation when I
first started my channel and this used
to always be my favorites it's the NARS
pressed powder in mountain now I do have
the one in beach it's just a little too
light so I like to sit underneath my
eyes but I still wanted an all around
face powder to use and every time I go
into Sephora the first place I go to is
Make Up For Ever in ours those are two
main brands I'm always at and you'll
find me there for about an hour and a
half no big deal but I got this one and
now an and it just matches me a lot
better and what I'm really okay I just
got lip gloss all in my hair so I just
got this one and what I really love
about it is you know I feel like this
they don't have a lot of shades with
this but I feel like they're awesome
because they really fluctuate with your
skin like with this color I could get a
little bit darker a little bit lighter
and it would still go amazingly so I
love this powder I used to love it so
much back in the day it's just a really
nice fine powder and it makes you look
flawless and I'm really thinking about
going and getting the nurse your matte
but I want to hold off until you use
like another Make Up For Ever foundation
up I've almost used one up plenty to
another
or I'll get like another foundation so
last thing from NARS is a blush this is
in the color deep throat I've been
wanting this one for a while and I
figured summer was coming up and I just
felt like spending the money so I went
ahead and picked it up and it's just
literally a beautiful beautiful shade
super pigmented you can never go wrong
with NARS blushes so I got that so
that's it for the makeup ah I hope you
guys enjoy that that was probably it for
makeup for a while because I just
actually revamped my IKEA door and the
if you watched my makeup collection
video which I will link down below if
you have it I had that five Muji drawer
on this side with the concealers and
face products in it I noticed that I
always forgot about the products that
were in that drawer so what I did is I
took all of the drawers out of that five
drawer Muji one you're going to excuse
my mess that I have but I want to show
you guys but what I did was I took each
drawer and I set them in here so they're
nice and divided up and that doesn't
usually happen often but they're nice
and divided up so concealers powders
bronzers blushes and then my clashes and
stuff well going here and now that my
makeup is now spread out to where I can
see it I'm gonna be using more products
just cuz I always forgot about the ones
in this drawer over here I don't know
what it was but always grin about them
so I did kind of change up my vanity a
little bit but I'm loving it so far I
have a picture on my Instagram if you
want to see the full thing and I'll link
my Instagram down below thank you guys
so much for watching I hope you enjoyed
the video and don't forget to subscribe
and go ahead and just leave comments
down below what videos you want to see
