a product I would repurchase video and I
haven't done a video like this before
I've done crap products video before and
I've done two of those and those are
back in last year or something like
grabbing it first on my channel but I
quit doing those because people really
took it to heart I figured I would do a
product I wouldn't repurchase because
it's not necessarily saying it's crap
it's just things I've used and when it
your purchase so yeah let's just go
ahead and get started okay so the first
product I would not repurchase this is
kind of one that you knew I would live
in mention if you watched my getting a
mini video and it's these oil free
cleansing lights from Neutrogena oh my
gosh these are the grapefruit ones and I
will never ever repurchase this again
first off I use these on my eyes I
didn't know I was it supposed to I guess
because I was so used to buying the blue
package and you can use them on your
eyes you can use them for anything and
then I didn't pay attention to this
saying their cleansing lights not makeup
remover wipes so I used too many eyes
horrible and I don't like the smell of
them
I won't even like use them up because
this smell is so strong so definitely
these are my first product now the
second one is something that you guys
have been asking me about ever since you
saw my haul and it is the NYX matte
finishing spray and I will continue to
use this but the reason why I won't
repurchase it is because I don't
necessarily feel like it keeps me matte
and a lot of you have been
asking me if I smell the smell of this
and I do but I don't feel like it's
overpowering or anything it doesn't
really bother me I didn't notice it
until you guys told me about it I don't
necessarily think this keeps me matte
and I don't think that it makes my
makeup stay on longer I feel like it
kind of makes me a little bit more shiny
than anything so I won't repurchase it
but I will you know use it up same thing
goes for the NYX stay matte but not flat
I would even know what I'm gonna do with
these because I I just they make my
pores look so big and I just I can't do
it the this is a nice foundation to kind
of stay matte I mean it's not like my
makeup forever one or anything but it
would be a cheaper alternative but this
really emphasizes my pores and if you
can really feel it on the skin it feels
really really thick and that's another
thing I don't really like about it but
it does have great coverage so that's
good so I guess if you don't have really
large pores like I do then you might
like this next is something that I feel
like I should have never bought because
there are so many drugstore alternatives
I don't even know why I bought this but
is the Laura Geller Mac maker this is
just a transparent powder to keep you
matte now this will give you a matte
from the day but it's nothing like a
miracle-worker or anything
I mean honestly like there's a bunch of
other drugstore options that can throw
this out of the water but yeah I'll
still use it of course it's a
transparent powder but when you're oily
you need transparent powder all the time
but I would not repurchase it so this
next product is the same thing there's a
lot of jokes or alternatives and it's
the Mac fluidline of blacktrack and I do
like this but I just feel like there's
so many other drugstore you know liners
that can do a great job as well I mean I
just I don't know the wet-and-wild what
are these called
the wet while pervy liners these are
really great as well and they're a lot
cheaper than the Mac fluid lines so I
would just go ahead and give these a try
before you just went out and bought them
and that's black track because it's just
a cheaper alternative and it does these
same thing products is a concealer this
is the coarse concealer corrector and
wildrose it says an illuminating
concealer brightening and a high
coverage I don't agree with any of that
I feel like it's such a watery
consistency and I just do not like it at
all it personally doesn't cover anything
underneath my under eyes I do think it's
a little bit brightening but it's so
sheer like I just don't feel like
putting it on because it's why I put on
something that's super sheer when you
can just go ahead and go in with like
the Mac Pro Longwear and have a great
coverage now this next a big one and
it's not just one it's the type of prop
like it's a type of product and these
these are the Stila long wear lip
colours and I bought these off of
HauteLook and the colors are gorgeous I
love I love all of the colors but the
formulation is not my thing
now they are super super pigmented but
when you put them on your lips it's like
you can totally feel it it just gets
into the lines of your lips like look
it's super pigmented but it just gets
into the lines of your lips and once it
dries it's just a nasty kind of feeling
like I don't want it on my lips at all I
mean it's just it's not my cup of tea I
know it's just a long wear you know
formulation of it and they might last a
while but I didn't get as far as you
know leaving it on for a while I put it
on my lips right when I put it on I took
it off because I did not like the way it
looked I felt like it looked really
messy and just super dry it was just not
good
so I with your purchase these now the
next product is something I'm kind of
sad about because I love Tarte I love
their Amazonian lines you guys know this
if you saw my heat proof makeup tutorial
I used a lot of Tarte products in there
because I just love them but this is the
Tarte skinnies motorized and
in clay waterproof liner now this is a
very black liner I'll give it that but I
have a very hard time finding like
liners to use on my waterline that won't
smudge I will literally put this on in a
minute later I will have it smudging all
underneath my eyes so bad it does not
last on my waterline at all and I mean
there's of course other drugstore
alternatives even the maximum at a coal
miner and smolder is one of my favorites
I do not like it when eyeliner comes
smudging underneath my lower lashes and
it just looks so bad to me especially
when it gathers here at the very outer
half oh it's a big pet peeve of mine I
can't do it the second last thing is
this Maybelline blush in wild blossom
now this with limited edition I don't
know if they're still out I think they
are because I think I saw them but I
just don't like this color I feel like
it it could be really really pretty but
once you put on your skin it just kind
of dust right off it's not really
anything special and it kind of leaves
like a white shimmery Sheen once you put
it on it doesn't really give you that
kind of purpley pink color on your
cheeks at all so not happy with the
formulation of it and how glittery it is
and it's just I mean it's just dust
right off and then you're left with
glitter and a little bit of white Sheen
on your cheeks and I just I don't like
that now this next thing is a pipe I
know a lot of people love so don't kill
me but it really didn't work for me and
it's the Sephora waterproof eye makeup
remover now I tried using this and it
took me forever to get my wife proof
mascara off like I had to keep just rub
it away I was like oh my god this is
never gonna come off and it was driving
me insane which is one of the prime
reasons I do not like waterproof mascara
I think it can be a total pain and it
just gets on my nerves but I have to use
it for summer because I don't want my
mascara running down my face so but this
did not take it off for me
I did find a new product that I'm
absolutely loving that takes it off so
amazingly and I posted a blog post about
it on my new blog and I did
create one so if you're a blogger and
you like for you to them then go check
out mine down below I did just start it
up and I'm still kind of experimenting
with it so definitely go check that out
but yeah I wouldn't repurchase this
little guy I might give it to my mom
because I know she loves waterproof
stuff maybe she can work with this but
for some reason just didn't work for me
so those are all the products I would
not repurchase I hope you guys enjoyed
this video let me know some other
products that you wouldn't repurchase
down below in the comments I'm sure we
would all love to hear and kind of know
why you let me purchase it just so we
can save some money and if you're
wanting a hair tutorial on this I did
film it so it'll be my next video up so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
I'll see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
