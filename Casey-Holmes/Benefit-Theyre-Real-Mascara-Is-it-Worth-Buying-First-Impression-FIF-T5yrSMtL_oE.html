a first impression on the benefit
they're real mascara now this is a skier
that has been around YouTube for a
pretty long time now and I know I'm
super late on the bandwagon but I just
didn't feel like going out and buying
the mascara but when I was at Ulta I saw
that they had this sample size for $10
and I figured why not try some people
with first impressions on my scares
they're kind of skeptical about it but
let me just tell you that I'm the type
of person who can tell if they're going
to like a mascara right off the bat
that's why I like the YSL mascara I had
a sample of it the first time I applied
it I knew I loved it and that's just how
I am with any mascara even my drugstore
mascaras like I try them first and if I
don't like them on the first try I'm not
going to keep using it because it didn't
give me a first a good first impression
I feel like it has to be the right
formula for me it has to be the right
brush it has to do certain things to my
lashes and if I don't like the way that
it turns out then I won't continue to
use it you know just go return it or
give it to a family member if they are
interested in it so let me just tell you
guys really quickly what this claims the
claims 94% of people saw dramatically
the volume 90% of people saw base to tip
curl so I'm not going to call my lashes
for this since it says that it says 94%
saw visible lift and 100% saw
long-wearing results now I will update
you in the description box below by the
long-range results because I'm not going
to go throughout the day and update you
guys because I have to go Christmas
shopping and do a bunch of different
things so I'm not going to have time to
do that today but I will let you know in
the description box how it lasted
throughout the day basically this is a
sample it's just the same as the you
know big size is just in a smaller
version it actually got one of these in
my birthday gift because my birthday is
this month November 25th have you
birthday doll my size tereus ladies or
my November babies basically you open it
up and I mean I've seen this mascara
everywhere on YouTube and so I pretty
much knew what to expect when I saw the
wand
basically has a little spiky thingies on
the end which I think it's kind of cool
it might be easy to get the outer and
inner corners and it's just like a
plastic little spiky brush which online
so I'm sure you guys the left side like
I said I'm not going to curl my lashes
but I did tight line which means I lined
the upper waterline which automatically
makes
lashes look fuller so like I said this
is the cute little bottle excited to try
it I'm really really excited I'm hoping
it lives up to what everybody says so
here we go okay so this is the first
application first off I'll tell you
right now I wish I'd called my lashes
because I don't think it's really
curling them they kind of just look like
they're going straight out I don't think
there's really a ton of all you I think
the reason why it looks so thick over
here is just because I tight lined
honestly I don't think it actually is
pretty thick like if I look up and stuff
it just doesn't look like super volume
eyes to me and I think this might be
more of a lengthening mascara I'm going
to try another application of it
I mean it's kind of separating them but
I feel like I need to go in with
tweezers and really fix that wait here
we go okay I got that fix oh that was
bothering me okay so now I mean I I do I
do like it when I spend the $20 on it no
you guys know I love my wife so mascara
there's there's just so much that a
mascara has to do to compete with that
because it does everything I want in
volume eyes it lengthens it just does
everything and it lasts all day I feel
like I should have called my lashes with
this first off that's kind of really
bothering me but for the most part I
think this would be a good like everyday
mascara now some people might call this
spidery but honestly it's mascara and
lashes like half the time it's gonna
look spidering anyways let me do the
other eye and I'll come back and show
you guys okay so this is the mascara on
both eyes I actually kind of like it I
think they look really nice okay so I'm
really quickly undo a conclusion and I
will say that I do like the mascara I
had to do the other eye to kind of see
if I like it or not and this I always
turns out that on this side for some odd
reason but I do like it so far I feel
like it looks like I have the demi
whispies on this looks like really wispy
lashes which I do like
for a day-to-day basis if you want to go
with more of a natural look I would
definitely do one application
I like dramatic lashes so obviously I go
with to pretty much every time that I
put on mascara I like it I don't think I
would purchase the full size though
since I'm such a wild baby doll at it
but I mean I do like this if I wanted to
keep using it I would definitely get the
sample size because I just don't feel
like I would use it as much to get the
full size but I do I do like it I think
it looks nice and hopefully it lasts up
throughout the day like the curl part I
think to really get that curl effect you
need to kind of go in and really put
some more mascara on there I would
recommend it if you're looking for
something that's less than the YSL
mascara and you're kind of wanting
something more natural or make your
lashes look nice and wispy but if you
want to try this out I definitely
recommend getting the sample first they
always have it at old tub and I think
they might have it at Sephora too so
definitely try out the sample first I
hope you
enjoy this FIF if you did please give it
a thumbs up and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
