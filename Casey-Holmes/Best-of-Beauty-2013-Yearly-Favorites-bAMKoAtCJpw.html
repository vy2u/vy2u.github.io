be an exciting one and it is going to be
a tag video it's basically like a yearly
favorites and I was actually asked by
Melissa which is when my friends here on
YouTube her YouTube name is melts and
ALP HS I think as I say it melts let me
know if I'm wrong Melissa but I think
that's how you say it but her name is
Melissa Raymond and she is so funny
she's so southern I love it and I love
her daughter had lady she is just just
such a cute family and she's so funny so
blunt and I love that so this is going
to be a collab with her and I thought
this would be really cool tag Sam
actually did this tag with another girl
I'll leave their channels down below
I'll leave everybody's channels I'm
mentioning in the description box and I
saw it and when Melissa asked me to clap
I was like yes of course that we looked
to because I love her channel I think
she's hilarious and I just adore her so
I'll leave her information down below
and I have to say I feel so bad because
it took me so long to sit down and film
this video today because with me doing a
video every day eyes literally sit down
every day and filming video you've been
running so late today so I'm sorry I
feel so bad I've been like apologizing
to Melissa because it just feels so bad
okay so I wrote all this stuff down
because my phone died
and the first thing is primers now this
is probably one that you guys are not
going to be surprised about and it is
these two primers I've been using so
much the benefit Porefessional this one
is amazing at minimizing pores I
absolutely love it but it does not keep
you very matte so I go in with this one
which is the Mac prep and prime skimmer
fine zone and these two just been my
favorite you've probably seen them in
almost all my videos for the past few
months if I'm doing like a makeup
tutorial or getting ready or something I
think these are the best primers around
and I love them and again oily skin
would like the bigger pores I definitely
recommend this combo cuz it really helps
minimize those pores but still keeps you
mad at the same time okay so next to
this foundation and I picked one
foundation for this I picked a drugstore
foundation because this is one that I
know I love throughout the year and I
always go back to it if I need something
affordable to wear with high-end
foundation
I do find ones I like but sometimes I
just switch them up and don't really
repurchase them and when I do kind of a
yearly favorites I want something that I
know ivory purchased or I will
repurchase in the long run so I picked
the covergirl three and one foundations
I think these are amazing drugstore
foundations definitely hands-down the
best ones in the drugstore great
coverage doesn't make you Olli this is
amazing if you have oily skin and you've
been looking for a good drugstore one
these are foundations to go to I have
raved about them so much throughout this
year next category is concealer it is
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer 's these
have really shined this year I feel like
these are a lot of people's cult
favorites just because the coverage is
insanely good and they last all day and
they don't sell into fine lines which is
pretty much what everybody wants in a
concealer so that's why these are
amazing
another concealer and once you mentioned
is from Mac as well and then this is Mac
Pro and concealed palette and I love
this to death I actually just hit pan on
this color and I'm excited about it I
know I'm going to purchase these two
shades and once I'm done with them in
this palette I think they're amazing
this is just such a cool palette to go
to if I have a breakout I will use the
darker shade if I need to clean up I
shadow or clean up underneath my eyes
I'll use the lighter shade and it's just
been so good I really like this palette
a lot and then last concealer I want to
mention is from the drugstore and it's
this Jane Cosmetics concealer this is an
awesome concealer I think it's a perfect
dupe for the Mac Pro Longwear I feel
like the Mac one does have like a longer
wear but this one is still really good I
mean it doesn't crease it covers very
well and it's from the drugstore so it's
really affordable okay so next is powder
and I definitely have a few in this tag
I knew I could pick just one item
because that wouldn't work for me I
would have to pick multiple items
because I'm basically you know putting
this tag as my yearly favorites so I
want to show you guys obviously my
favorite things first off are these NARS
powders I have one in mountain and one
in beach these are so awesome I used to
rave about these all the time when I
first started my channel and then I ran
out of it and just never repurchase
ticks it's so expensive but I did
repurchase Beach first and I found that
it was a little too light but I still
decided to keep it and get Mountain I've
actually used a beach a lot Beach comes
in really great handy and mountains just
one of my favorites as well
I just adore these powders I think
they're amazing they make your face
literally flawless and I'm just in love
with them okay and next one is a cult
favorite for me this is a makeup forever
what is it called super matte loose
powder I had a complete blank
but this is such an awesome powder I
love this I've purchased three of these
so finely milled it's great to set
underneath the eyes it doesn't cause
like a white cast underneath your eyes
and photos or even in person this also
looks really nice over your pores it
doesn't accentuate them or anything like
that and it's translucent so I mean no
matter what color I am from self tan to
not self tan I can use this powder
another one I've been loving for the
year is this Mac prep and prime
transparent finishing powder this is an
awesome powder again makes your skin
look really really smooth I actually
purchased this before this head came
back in stock because it was out of
stock for literally ever and I had been
using this and I really loved it I think
it's so amazing it is cheaper I believe
than the Make Up For Ever one so if
you're gonna try one out I think you
should try this one okay I just have two
more powders one last one is tie-in and
then I have a drugstore one so this one
is the Dior skin err flash matte touch
love this stuff if you have very oily
skin I definitely recommend this in your
life it helps keep you matched it does
kind of have a tint to it so just be
aware of that and I believe it's only in
one color I love this one it's so
awesome I just think it looks really
great on the skin it's easy to apply I
don't apply it like this on my face I
actually just apply on the brush and
then press it into my skin and it works
great and then the last one is from
Maybelline this is a Maybelline Dream
matte powder and this is a by far the
best drugstore powder ever I've
purchased so many of these is even
comparable I would say to Norris powders
because it's superfine and it just gives
you a flawless look and it's great for
touch-up powder because since it is so
finely milled it doesn't look cakey on
the skin so you can't see it or anything
like that I could probably put like
three thousand layers well I'm a very
saturating I can probably put on four
layers of this and it won't look cakey
like you won't see it so I love this one
I just noticed how many powders I have
but that's what happens when you have
oily skin you love powders right right
bronzers I have one too have two one is
from Bobbi Brown I really really really
love this bronzer actually I have more
than one just kidding but I'm almost
about to get paint on this you can kind
of see the rings in it this is a
beautiful bronzer thanks to Jaclyn hill
I went and picked this up because she
was raving about it and I loved the way
it looked on her skin and this is a
stunning stunning powder least not too
orange it's not too red it's just that
perfect in-between shade and I love it
it's beautiful so color I get is golden
light and then for another high-end
powder this one I have to mention this
is the hoola benefit bronzer I did hit
pan on it which I'm really excited about
I mean this would go with a ton of
different skin tones and it's just so
easy to blend out and it just looks
beautiful I mean this is like another
cult favorite on YouTube because it's
the bomb and then for a drugstore I had
shout out my NYC sudden bronze bronzing
powder in Montauk bronze and I love this
bronzer I think it is beautiful
especially during like the summertime
this gives you a gorgeous bronze glow
and I just I love it
for 2.99 I mean you can't really pass
that up this is a beautiful beautiful
shade I think this is the darkest one in
the collection okay next is blush this
was a hard one because I have so many
blushes that I love but I decided to go
through like think of like different
seasons and what was the one that I
always kind of went back to and I have
three from Mac and the first one is
alpine bronze I love this color I mean I
if I cannot figure out what blush to
wear with a certain eye look I always go
to this one because it's just perfect it
goes with anything it's a nice bronze
shade and it's not too overpowering or
anything like that I just I really love
I'll pan bronze is hands-down probably
my favorite blush for a Mac because it
just goes with everything I love this a
lot more than warm stole because I feel
like warm soul really doesn't show up on
the skin very well for me all right the
next one from Mac is honey jasmine this
came out and all about orange collection
and this is beautiful I mean I feel like
this who knows with so many different
looks as well especially if you're more
on the tan side it looks so pretty and
then this one is a permanent color this
one is called Melba this one again it
goes with every look looks beautiful and
I love the matte blushes because they're
so easy to work with they're easy to
blend out and I mean I just I love them
I I love Mac blushes I could show you
guys so many blushes that I've loved for
the year but I decided to narrow it down
to three because I figured 20 would be
too much okay for highlighter that one
was so easy it's definitely the bombs
mary lou manizer this is hands-down one
of my favorite highlighters it doesn't
look choppy on the cheeks it gives a
gorgeous glow and I think it's just
amazing definitely one of my favorites
it's not glittery it just has like a
beautiful sheen to it so awesome you can
find the bomb sometimes on HauteLook
which I definitely recommend because
they will have sales on these items and
I think you can get this for like 9
bucks woohoo for the brows which I have
been all into brows this year last year
I didn't really think I needed to be
into brows which I really should have
been but this year I I really went out
of my comfort zone and started filling
in the brows you know I've had some bad
brow moments and good brow moments but I
think I finally have come to the point
where I love the bolder brow I love a
stronger arch I think it looks really
gorgeous and I think it frames my face a
lot better so first thing is the
Anastasio brow is in brunette the best
brow pencil i've ever tried in my life
so easy to work with the spoolie on the
end I swear there's something different
about this smoothly than all the other
ones because I feel like it blends
everything so well better than any other
spoolie I've ever had and the color I'm
always in is brunette this is actually
the second one I purchased and I love it
it's super thin great to travel with
also the anastacio tinted brow gel and
Bruna
I love this if I go a little bit too
heavy with the brows and make them too
dark I will always go in with this and
kind of lighten them up it's kind of
like doing a bleach treatment on your
brows without actually having the bleach
I love this I think it's great at first
I was really scared at the color because
it is very light but it surprisingly
works very well and I have been really
enjoying this this year so next is this
Tarte waterproof Amazonian clay brow
mousse I can't necessarily tell you if
it's waterproof or not I haven't tested
it out or anything but it does last a
long time the color I'm in is medium
brown and this is awesome it doesn't
come with a brush that I currently can't
find right now but it comes with a dual
sided brush with the brush and then the
spoolie on the other end and I love this
especially with the brow Wiz
I'll just shape up my brows with the
brow Wiz and then fill them in with this
and I feel like the product lasts so
long and they look really gorgeous so
those have definitely been my favorite
brow products okay for eyeshadow palette
I had to choose my Mac palette this is
one that I always go back to it has my
favorite shades in it obviously a bunch
of them are neutrals okay obviously a
bunch of them are neutrals and I did
fill this up this year and I loved all
of the colors in this palette I think
they're all beautiful
definitely my little customized Mac
palette has been my favorite for the
year mascara okay this one I just did a
review on so if you want to check out
more details about it I'll link it below
but it's the YSL mascara I've been using
this since I think before it was before
beautycon so I think I think I had this
yeah I had this before me - calling me
to come back in June I've used this for
a while if only this is my second - but
my first one lasted me so long and I
have I believe this will last me a long
time as well and I love it if you want
to see a detailed review on it I will
link the video down below because I do a
demo and everything for you but just
know this is my favorite mascara of the
year I love it for lip pencils I have
two the first one is one I continuously
used throughout the year it is steel as
a long wear lip pencil and aspiring I
love this shade I think it is beautiful
it's perfect for any nude look it's a
nude pink and
it's easy to work with and it doesn't
like tug on your lips and then one that
I've been using for the past couple
months from the drugstore is this Revlon
Colorstay lipliner and nude again this
is another great nude that doesn't tug
at your lips and I really like the color
of it so those are my two favorites okay
for lipstick I have four two for a Mac
and get from Urban Decay
oh no I lied f355 I'm 2 for Mac two from
Urban Decay and one from the drugstore
so the 2 for Mac are creme de nude which
is a really gorgeous nude it's a very
very very moody top but with a darker
gloss it does look really nice and then
the other one is rebel by Mac this is
just one of my favorite colors I always
go back to it I think it's beautiful
it's not too dark and I love it
especially for this time of year
from Urban Decay the two that I love are
native this is a pink nude very very
very pretty and I like these Urban Decay
lipsticks because they are very creamy
and easy to apply and I think they last
a long time on my lips and then the next
one is Naked 2 which is a gorgeous nude
and it's not to nude this is a great
kind of darker nude personally love the
more dark nudes especially now I'm not
into very muted lips so this is one of
my favorites as well and then speaking
of darker nudes this one from wet and
wild it's the Wet n Wild Fergie
collection and it's called Fergie daily
this lipstick looks at beaten up but I
have used it so much it's definitely one
of my favorites if I could recommend any
lipstick from the drugstore that's a
nude it would be this one I even bought
a backup because I don't know when
they're gonna stop selling the fruity
collection so I had to go buy backup
ok next is lip gloss I have three the
first one is floor abundance from Mac
this is one of the first Mac lip glosses
I purchased and loved and I think it's
the perfect pink nude if you're just
getting into the lip glasses from Mac I
know I had to kind of ease myself into
them because they were so sticky that it
couldn't handle it
now I don't even care I think it's fine
but this one's awesome it doesn't even
have the writing on it because I just
use it so much and this is hands-down
one of my favorites I will definitely be
even purchasing that and then another
one is from Mac as well this one is
called patience please
this is April long-wear lip glass it's a
pink nude I think this is more on the
nude side it can really nude out your
lips if you want it to but I think it's
beautiful it does last a very long time
and I love the color of it and the pro
long wear lip glasses are a lot stickier
than the regular lip glasses so I
recommend trying the shorter ones out
first and then going to the longer ones
if you are not a fan of this sticky lip
glosses and the last lip gloss is from
Sigma this is in the color hint I have
been obsessed with this ever since I got
it I got this back in November yeah
sometime November so it's kind of like a
new word month or newer yearly favorite
but I loved it like I can't stop using
it I have it on today it is so beautiful
this is the kind of color that I talked
crimp de nude with and it looks stunning
so love this shade you've got to get it
it's really really good okay I can't
remember if liners was a part of this
video but as it was I will leave my
favorite liners down below in the
description so last question in this tag
was beauty subscription and personally I
don't have the beauty subscription I've
been loving um I just I don't have one I
was subscribed to Disney for a while but
I just kind of cancelled it because I
was kind of over it but I mean I don't
