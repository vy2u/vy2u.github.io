an exciting one and it is going to be a
tag video it's basically like a yearly
favorites and I was actually asked by
Melissa which is when my friends here on
YouTube her youtube name is melts mal
PHS I think as I say it melts let me
know if I'm wrong Melissa but I think
that's how you say it but her name is
Melissa Raymond and she is so funny
she's so southern I love it and I love
her daughter had lady she is just just
such a cute family and she's so funny so
blunt and I love that so this is going
to be a collab with her and I thought
this would be really cool tag Sam
actually did this tag with another girl
I'll leave their channels down below
I'll leave everybody's channels and
mentioning in the description box and I
saw it and when Melissa asked me to
collab I was like yes of course I would
love to because I love her channel I
think she's hilarious and I just adore
her so I'll leave her information down
below and I have to say I feel so bad
because it took me so long to sit down
and film this video today because with
me doing a video everyday eyes literally
sit down every day and filming video
you've been running so late today so I'm
sorry I feel so bad I've been like
apologizing to Melissa because it just
feels so bad ok so I wrote all the stuff
down because my phone guy and the first
thing is primers now this is probably
one that you guys are not going to be
surprised about and it is these two
primers I've been using so much the
benefit Porefessional this one is
amazing at minimizing pores I absolutely
love it but it does not keep you very
met so I go in with this one which is
the Mac prep and prime skimmer fine zone
and these two just been my favorite
you've probably seen them in almost all
my videos for the past few months if i'm
doing like a makeup tutorial or getting
ready or something I think these are the
best primers around and I love them and
again oily skin would like the bigger
pores I definitely recommend this combo
because it really helps minimize those
pores but still keeps you mad at the
same time ok so next to this foundation
and I picked one foundation for this I
picked a drugstore foundation because
this is one that I know I love
throughout the year and I always go back
to it if I need something affordable to
wear with high end
nations i do find ones i like but
sometimes i just switched them up and
don't really repurchase them and when I
do kind of a yearly favorites I want
something that I know I were purchased
or I will repurchase in the long run so
I picked the covergirl three-in-one
foundations I think these are amazing
drugstore foundations definitely hands
down the best ones in the drugstore
great coverage doesn't make you only
this is amazing if you have oily skin
and you've been looking for a good
drugstore one these are foundations to
go to I've read about them so much
throughout this year next category is
concealer it is new mac pro longwear
concealer these have really shined this
year I feel like these are a lot of
people's cult favorites just because the
coverage is insanely good and they last
all day and they don't settle into fine
lines which is pretty much what
everybody wants in a concealer so that's
why these are amazing another concealer
and once you mentioned is from Mac as
well and then this is Mac Pro and
concealed palette and I love this to
death I actually just hit pan on this
color and I'm excited about it I know
I'm going to purchase these two shades
and once i'm done with them in this
palette I think they're amazing this is
just such a cool palette to go to if I
have a breakout I'll use the darker
shade if I need to clean up eyeshadow or
clean up underneath my eyes I'll use the
lighter shade and it's just been so good
i really like this palette a lot and
then last concealer i want to mention is
from the drugstore and it's this Jane
cosmetics concealer this is an awesome
concealer I think it's a perfect dupe
for the mac pro longwear I feel like the
mac one does have like a longer wear but
this one is still really good I mean it
doesn't crease it covers very well and
it's from the drugstore so it's really
affordable okay so next is powder and I
definitely have a few in this tag I knew
I could pick just one item because that
wouldn't work for me I would have picked
multiple items because I'm basically you
know putting this tag as my yearly
favorites so I want to show you guys
obviously my favorite things first off
are these nars powders I have one in
mountain in one in beach these are so
awesome I used to rave about things all
the time when i first started my channel
and then i right
out of it and just never a purchase tix
it's so expensive but I did we purchase
beach first and I found out it was a
little too light I still decided to keep
it and get mountain I've actually used a
beach a lot beach comes in really great
handy and mountains just one of my
favorites as well i just adore these
powders i think they're amazing they
make your face literally flawless and
i'm just in love with them okay and next
one is a cult favorite for me this is a
makeup forever what is it called super
matte loose powder I had a complete
blank but this is such an awesome powder
I love this I've purchased three of
these so finely milled it's great to set
underneath the eyes it doesn't cause
like a white cast underneath your eyes
and photos or even in person this also
looks really nice over your pores it
doesn't accentuate them or anything like
that and it's translucent so I mean no
matter what color I am from self tan to
not self tan I can use this powder
another one I've been loving for the
year is this Mac prep and prime
transparent finishing powder this is an
awesome powder again makes your skin
look really really smooth actually
purchase this before this head came back
in stock because it was out of stock for
Lily ever and I had been using this and
I really love it I think it's so amazing
it is cheaper I believe then the make up
for ever one so if you're going to try
one out i think you should try this one
okay i just have two more powders one
last one is high in and then i have a
drugstore one so this one is the
deerskin air flash matt touch love this
stuff if you have very oily skin i
definitely recommend this in your life
it helps keep you match it does kind of
have a tint to it so just be aware of
that and i believe it's only in one
color i love this one it's so awesome i
just think it looks really great on the
skin it's easy to apply I don't apply it
like this on my face I actually just
apply on the brush and then press it
into my skin and it works great and then
the last one is from Maybelline this is
a maybelline dream matte powder and this
is a by far the best drugstore powder
ever I've purchased so many of these is
even comparable I would say to norris
powders because it's super fine and it
just gives you a flawless look and it's
great for a touch-up powder because
since it is so finely milled it doesn't
look cakey on the skin so you can't see
it or anything like
I could probably put like three thousand
layers well I'm ever exaggerating I can
probably put on four layers of this and
it won't look cakey like you won't see
it so I love this one I just noticed how
many powders i have but that's what
happens when you have oily skin you love
powders right right bronzers I have one
to have two one is from Bobbi Brown I
really really really love this bronzer
actually I have more than one just
kidding but I'm almost about to hit pan
on this you can kind of see the Rings in
it this is a beautiful bronzer thanks to
Jaclyn hill I went and picked this up
because she was raving about it and I
love the way it looked on her skin and
this is a stunning stunning powder least
not to orange it's not to read it's just
that perfect in-between shade and I love
it it's beautiful so color i get is
golden light and then for another
high-end powder this one i have to
mention this is the hula benefit bronzer
I did hit pan on it which I'm really
excited about I mean this would go with
a ton of different skin tones and it's
just so easy to blend out and just looks
beautiful I mean this is like another
cult favorite on youtube because it's
the bomb and then for a drugstore I had
shout out my NYC seven bronzer bronzing
powder in montauk bronze and I love this
bronzer I think it is beautiful
especially during like the summertime
this gives you a gorgeous bronze glow
and I just I love it for 2 99 I mean you
can't really pass that up this is a
beautiful beautiful shade I think this
is the darkest one in the collection
okay next is blush this was a hard one
because i have so many blushes that i
love but i decided to go through like
think of like different seasons and what
was the one that I always kind of went
back to and I have three from Mac and
the first one is alpine bronze I love
this color I mean I if I cannot figure
out what blush to wear with a certain I
look I always go to this one because
it's just perfect it goes with anything
it's a nice bronze shade and it's not
too overpowering or anything like that I
just I really love it alp and bronze is
hands down probably my favorite blush
from Mac because it just
everything I love this a lot more than
warm stole because I feel like warm soul
really doesn't show up on the skin very
well for me alright the next one from
Mac is honey jasmine this came out and
all about orange collection and this is
beautiful I mean I feel like this who
knows so many different looks as well
especially if you're more on the tan
side it looks so pretty and then this
one is a permanent color this one is
called Melba this one again it goes with
every look looks beautiful and i love
the matte blushes because they're so
easy to work with they're easy to blend
out and I mean I just I love them and I
love mac blushes I could show you guys
so many blushes that I loved for the
year but i decided to narrow it down to
three because I figure 20 would be too
much okay for highlighter that one was
so easy it's definitely the bombs
mary-lou manizer this is hands down one
of my favorite highlighters it doesn't
look chalky on the cheeks it gives a
gorgeous glow and I think it's just
amazing definitely one of my favorites
it's not glittery it just has like a
beautiful Sheen to it so awesome you can
find the bomb sometimes on hautelook
which I definitely recommend because
they will have sales on these items and
I think you can get this for like 9
bucks woohoo for the brows which I have
been all into browse this year last year
I didn't really think I needed to be in
to browse which I really should have
been um but this year I I really went
out of my comfort zone and started
filling in the brows you know I've had
some bad brown moments and good brown
moments but I think I finally have come
to the point where i love the boulder
brow i love a stronger arch I think it
looks really gorgeous and I think it
friends my face a lot better so first
thing is the Anasazi of brow is in
brunette the best brow pencil I've ever
tried in my life so easy to work with
the spoolie on the end I swear there's
something different about this smoothly
than all the other ones because i feel
like it blends everything so well better
than any other spoolie i've ever had and
the color i'm always in is brunette this
is actually the second one i purchased
and i love it it's super thin great to
travel with also the Anasazi up tinted
brow gel and brunette I love this if I
go a little bit too heavy with the brows
and make them too dark I will always go
in with this and kind of
them up it's kind of like doing a bleach
treatment on your brows without actually
having the bleach i love this i think
it's great at first I was really scared
at the color because it is very light
but it's surprisingly works very well
and I have been really enjoying this
this year so next is this hard
waterproof Amazonian clay brow mousse I
can't necessarily tell you if it's
waterproof or not I haven't tested it
out or anything but it does last a long
time the color i'm in is medium brown
and this is awesome it does come with a
brush that i currently can't find right
now but it comes with a dual sided brush
with the brush and then the spoolie on
the other end and i loved this
especially with the brow Wiz I'll just
shape out my brows with the brow is and
then fill them in with this and I feel
like the products last so long and they
look really gorgeous so those have
definitely been my favorite brow
products okay for eyeshadow palette I
had to choose my mac palette this is one
that I always go back to it has my
favorite shades in it obviously a bunch
of them are neutrals okay obviously a
bunch of them are neutral and I didn't
fill this up this year and I love all of
the colors in this palette I think
they're all beautiful definitely my
little customized mac call it has been
my favorite for the year mascara okay
this one I just did a review on so if
you want to check out more details about
it i'll link it below but it's the YSL
mascara i've been using this that I
think before it was before beautycon so
i think i think i had this yeah had this
before me to convey to come back in June
IV uses for a while if only this is my
second to but my first one lasted me so
long and I have I believe this will last
me a long time as well and i love it if
you want to see a detailed review on it
i will link the video down below because
i do a demo and everything for you but
just know this is my favorite mascara of
the year full of it for lip pencils i
have to the first one is one i
continuously used throughout the year it
is steel as a long where that pencil and
aspiring i love this shade i think it is
beautiful it's perfect for any nude look
it's a nude pink and it's easy to work
with and it doesn't like tug on your
lips and then one that i've been using
for the past couple months from the
drugstore is this Revlon Colorstay lip
liner and nude again this is
another great nude that doesn't tug at
your lips and I really like the color of
it so those are my two favorites okay
for lipstick I have 42 for mac and skin
from urban decay oh no I lied I'm 3555
I've to my mac to bourbon decay and one
from the drugstore so the two for mac
are crendon nude which is a really
gorgeous nude it's a very very very new
top it with a darker gloss it does look
really nice and then the other one is
rebel by Mac this is just one of my
favorite colors I always go back to it I
think it's beautiful it's not too dark
and i love it especially for this time
of year from urban decay the two that i
love our native this is a pink nude very
very very pretty and I like these urban
decay lipsticks because they are very
creamy and easy to apply and I think
they last a long time on my lips and
then the next one is naked 2 which is a
gorgeous nude and it's not to noon this
is a great kind of dark renewed
personally love the more dark nudes
especially now I'm not into very muted
lips so this is one of my favorites as
well and then speaking of darker nudes
this one from wet and wild it's the wet
and wild fergie collection and it's
called for you daily this lipstick looks
at beaten up but i have used it so much
it's definitely one of my favorites if i
could recommend any lipstick from the
drugstore that's nude it would be this
one I even bought a backup because I
don't know when they're going to stop
selling the free collection so I had to
go buy back up ok next is lip gloss I
have three the first one is floor
abundance from Mac this is one of the
first Mac lip glosses i purchased and
loved and I think it's the perfect pink
nude if you're just getting into the lip
glasses from Mac I know I had to kind of
ease myself into them because they were
so sticky that I couldn't handle it but
now I don't even care i think it's fine
but this one's awesome it doesn't even
have the writing on it because i just
use it so much and this is hands-down
one my favorites i will definitely be
even purchasing that and then another
one is from Mac as well this one is
called patience please this is a pro
longwear lipglass it's a pink nude I
think this is
more on the nude side it can really need
out your lips if you want it to but I
think it's beautiful it does last a very
long time and I love the color of it and
the pro longwear lip glasses are a lot
stickier than the regular lip glasses so
I recommend trying the shorter ones out
first and then going to the longer ones
if you are not a fan of the sticky lip
glosses and the last lip gloss is from
Sigma this is in the color hint I have
been obsessed with this ever since I got
it I got this back in November yeah
sometime November so it's kind of like a
new were month or newer yearly favorite
but I loved it like I can't stop using
it i have it on today it is so beautiful
this is the kind of color that i talked
creme de nude with and it looks stunning
so love this shade you've got to get it
it's really really good ok I can't
remember if liners was a part of this
video but as it was I will leave my
favorite liners down below in the
description so last question in this tag
was video subscription and personally I
don't have the baby subscription I've
