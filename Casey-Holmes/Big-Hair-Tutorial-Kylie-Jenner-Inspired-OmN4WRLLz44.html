a hair tutorial and this was inspired by
Kylie Jenner and I know I've been doing
a lot of Jenner inspired tutorials or
Kardashian inspired but it's because I
just love their hair and makeup and I've
been really seeing a lot of things that
I've been loving lately from them so
I've been wanting to recreate them but
this one is a hairstyle that Kendall
were not too long ago um
but keep in mind it's not exactly like
hers her here's a lot more fuller on top
than mine is
but um I still went with the whole theme
of tighter curls on the bottom and then
looser slider hair up top I thought I
did show up for you guys so it is
inspired it's not an exact dupe of her
hair look but I loved it and I actually
love the way this turns out I did use a
smaller barrel on the bottom and then
when I went to my top half of my hair to
finish up I didn't use 25 millimeter
ones and I did use the titanium ones
from nume and of course I have a coupon
code for them down below you can either
get $115 off one of the curling wands or
I'm gonna have a package for you also so
you could get two curling wands for a
great price down below if you're
interested and I'll also be using a
straightener this is nice to do
straightener I've had it forever
I bought it for my thing flat iron
expert is like a long time ago but I
also had a straightener in this if you
want to see how I did this hair then
just keep watching and don't forget to
like the video let's just go ahead and
get started
okay the first thing I'm doing is taking
dry shampoo cuz I am doing this on
second day hair I let my hair air dry
the night before so that's why it looks
a hot mess
um this is my favorite dry shampoo it's
from batiste it's for the brunettes out
there it's like a hint of color or
something so I'm just gonna spray it in
massage it and then brush my hair all
out and today I will be using extensions
I'm gonna be using two tracks from my
Bellamy extensions that I have I love
these and two tracks are literally all I
need to get a bunch of volume in my hair
so I will put my hair up halfway
starting at my
and I will tease the section where I'm
going to apply the hair extensions just
so they do stay in really nicely
so after you've got your extension thing
you just want to brush out your hair
make sure you don't have any tangles
going on and I'm gonna take the nume 19
millimeter wand and I'm gonna take
smaller sections and you're just going
to basically wrap it around the one I
kind of did interchange on my dim away
from my face
towards my face away from my face just
kind of different curls just to give
some more volume but keep in mind when
you are curling your hair around this
one try to leave at least two to three
inches out at the end like I'm doing
here it's just going to add a little bit
more links and not have it so spiral and
the curls like go up to your face so I'm
just going to repeat this process all in
the bottom half of my hair
so after you've done the whole bottom
half of your hair you're just going to
take the next section of hair down and
we're still going to be using the same
19 millimeter wand but we're just going
to be using thicker sections this time
so you can see the section I'm using
here is pretty thick I'm going to wrap
my hair around it also about I'd say
four inches away from the root because
we do want our roots to kind of be
flatter than the bottom half of our hair
so just try to say you know about four
inches away from your root when you are
curling this section and again make sure
these are thicker pieces than what you
had just done
okay so after you're done doing that you
just want to take the top layer down and
this will be the least time consuming a
part of this video but you're still
gonna take a thicker sections and we're
going to be using a 25 millimeter one so
it's gonna give bigger curls and you're
just going to again stay about 4 to 5
inches away from the root and just curl
the ends of your hair
now after I was done curling I noticed
that it was way too curly on top so I
just took my straightener and ran it
through the top section of my hair I'm
not keeping my hair's my straightener on
my hair for a long period of time I'm
just simply running it through just to
flatten it out a little bit and give it
that Kylie Jenner look that she had in
the picture so again if you do just get
too much curl up top then just run your
straightener through it and you'll be
fine
and now I'm taking a wide tooth comb and
I'm just going to tease the bottom half
of my hair just to give it a lot more
volume and then this is basically what
the hair looks like because I'm gonna
take my L'Oreal on that hairspray I love
this stuff and I'm just going to spray
my hair and I ended up not being super
happy with my bangs so of course I went
back through and you know fixed my bangs
on my straightener cuz my bangs
sometimes can be the biggest pain in the
world
but once you get that down you're good
so that's pretty much the hair tutorial
guys I hope you enjoyed this video it is
a little time consuming but I love the
outcome of it I think it's super pretty
and thank you guys so much for watching
don't forget to like the video and I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
