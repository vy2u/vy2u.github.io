look if you know me you know I love me
some orange I love orange so much orange
makeup orange blushes anything you know
I'm obsessed and I saw this Kylie lip
kit and I was like oh yes I need to try
it so of course I got this I'll be doing
a full review demo I got five shades in
that review video keep an eye out for it
because I will also be giving away two
lift kits because I ordered too many and
I was like what the hell I'll give them
away to you guys cuz I know how hard
they are to get your hands on I hope you
guys enjoyed this look it's definitely a
little bit more bold but you could also
change out this lip for a nude lip if
you wanted it so if you want to see how
I got this makeup look and some of my
favorite products for spring then let's
just get right on into the video okay so
this is the eye look that we're going
for there's no liner the only liner I
have is in the inner corner right here
just because my eyes have like a weird
shape to them so whenever I apply false
lashes it looks really bare right here
so I just add a little bit of liner in
that inner corner we're going to go
ahead and start with the eye shadow it's
very easy almost anyone can do this and
of course the false lashes are optional
you don't have to do them if you don't
want to or if you just don't feel
comfortable putting on false lashes so
the first thing I'm going to use is this
NARS smudge proof eyeshadow base I love
this especially for spring if you have
really oily eyelids you will adore this
product because it is a lifesaver for
you it really helps the creasing I have
such oily eyelids and it took me so long
to find something that took care of it
so this is definitely that product and
then I'm going to be excessive today and
apply one more primer
I'm just trying this one out this is the
Kat Von D color correcting eye shadow
primer this is new by her and it's in a
stick form the way I'm liking to apply
it is just put some on my finger like
this and then apply it to my lid just
because I feel like this pencil is a
little bit harsh on my lid and it kind
of hurts it a little bit um so I just
like to apply to my finger and then put
it all over the lid is really creamy
like I said I just like to warm it up
and once this gets like a little ball
tip to it like a little bit more rounded
I will go ahead and apply it that way
but I just kind of want to get
of the tip so I'm just putting on back
my finger okay next we're going to use
some tape you guys know I love tape so
I'm just going to take some and take a
little piece and put it on the back of
my hand
take it off a couple times I do this so
much if you have downward eyes I would
definitely recommend this just so that
it angles your eyeshadow up and it will
help really lift your eyes so if you
have downturned eyes like I do this is a
lifesaver
using the morphe 35o pal I know this is
in stock out of stock in stock out of
stock but most the time it does come
back in stock so just keep an eye out
for it so I'm actually going to take
this shade right here this is one of my
favorite shades just a nice transition
color and when you use the Mac 224 I've
been liking this brush to apply
transition color just because it's a
little bit more precise my Sigma ones
have kind of just like went out and just
apply it all over when I really want to
have control of that color and where I
put it so this is nice just to have that
control and I like to start right there
in the crease a little bit above it and
then I'll just slowly start blending it
upwards a little bit towards the brow I
don't want to go all the way towards the
brow I just want to kind of do circular
motions and blend out that line just so
it fades up towards the brow like I said
I like this brush because a little bit
more precise it is pricey you can find
alternatives for sure Sigma's is really
good I've just had mine for so long that
they're kind of losing their shape so I
went back to this one because I've had
this one of my collection for a really
long time so I'm going to take this
bright orange in here I love oranges
oranges are my favorite color for spring
and summer and I'm just going to put
this into the outer V and then drag it
into the crease this is a sigma e25 I
really like it's a blending brush and
just going to pack that color in some
people are scared of a really bright
orange like this but it can look so
pretty I really love warm colors so just
blend that right in there it's ok if
some gets on the lid it's not that big
of a deal but you do want to put some
right here in this outer V okay now what
we're going to do is
going to take a while Wallander we're
gonna take a white eyeliner this one's
for makeup forever I think it might vlog
I said they're from Urban Decay but I
was really exhausted so I got that wrong
but we're just going to take this white
eyeliner and put it right here in the
inner corner of the eye this just gives
a nice space to the cream shadow we're
going to put on top and then I'm going
to go in with this Sigma performance
shader lid this is the e 50 six it has a
really small into it I'm just going to
first blend this out with that brush and
I'm kind of flicking it upwards like
this into the crease a little bit and
also just flicking it out to blend that
line so after that I'm going to take the
cream shade in this palette and I'm
gonna put that right on top again doing
the same motion of kind of flicking it
upwards and out get that nice bright
inner corner it's really going to make
you look more awake okay the next thing
we're going to do I can't find my flat
shader brush that I have from Mac
because it's amazing and it's great for
packing on lid color can you remember
what it's called so I'm just going to
take this one this is a Mac 239 and I'm
going to take a fix+ and just spray that
you can use eyedrops if you don't have a
fixed plus then I'm going to dip it into
this color right here which is one of my
favorite shimmery colors it's gorgeous
this palette is honestly just one my
favorites that's why it's so beat up
because I take this with me everywhere
and I'm going to put this all over my
lid and I'm going to connect it to this
inner corner and just work it out I
don't want to take it all the way to the
outer V I just mainly want to focus it
right here we're going to take that same
shadow brush that we used with the
orange and we're just going to go over
it I'm not applying any extra product or
anything like that I'm just using
whatever is on the brush I'm just going
to very lightly blend out these edges in
the crease and in the outer V and I'm
going to just tap it into that orange
and fix up this outer V make sure it's
nice and deep if you just use a light
hand when you're blending this in
to the lid color it will fade so nicely
so just the lighter the hand the better
so then what I'm going to do is curl my
lashes and apply mascara which is the
benefit roller lash I just love this
mascara and then I'm going to apply
these lashes I believe they're from Lena
lashes but I'm not sure I will
double-check and leave them down below
I'm going to show you guys really
quickly what this look looks like
without false lashes it looks just as
good so that's what it looks like
without false lashes I do like that I
would do that for kind of like an
everyday look but I'm going to apply
these beautiful little babies and I'm
just going to measure them out if you
find that your false lashes are too long
which a lot of the times they can be
because people like to make them extra
long because not everybody has the same
eye shape the lower lashes are one of
the lashes that honestly are so long I
have to cut off a ton with those but I'm
just going to measure here and I can
kind of just see a little bit that I
need to cut off because it's going to be
longer once you press it down towards
your eyes I don't want to cut in the
inner part of the last you want to cut
towards the outer corner because it's
going to keep your lash looking natural
if you cut from the inner corner it will
mess up the way that the lash looks and
make it look kind of chunky on your
lashes and it won't fade as nicely going
outwards so always cut from the outer
corner to the inner corner and you can
just cut off a little bit at a time
don't cut up a lot on your first go
around just because you don't want to
cut off too much and then have a short
lash on your eyes I'm going to apply my
false lash glue this is the house of
lashes eyelash glue in black it's my
favorite and household lashes has the
best eyelash glue ever I'm just gonna
put this on the lash you only need a
little bit of this stuff it's really
tacky really fast and it's just so good
you guys I will not use another eyelash
glue I have two of the bigger ones that
I don't know where they're at right now
I just got back from traveling so I have
to find those and while applying false
lashes I like to have a mirror right up
to me so I'm going to use the mirror
from this L'Oreal infallible Pro contour
because I'm going to use this in the
video as well to control with I've been
loving this stuff if you haven't tried
it out I definitely would this is in the
shade medium it's just awesome okay and
now I'm just going to put these
on I like to first place them in the
middle and then do the inner corner and
place those where I want them get them
as close to your lashes as possible
now take the end and connect this one to
the end of my lashes and then one thing
I'll do is I'll go all my fingers and
I'll just press them together just so
you don't see any gaps and you can make
sure that lash is on nice and secure
never really show you guys my brows or
lashes because I have done videos on
them in the past they definitely changed
as the time is gone so I figured since
this is such an easy look I would share
it with you guys and share some of my
favorite products Leena lashes has some
of my favorite false lashes also velour
Koko lashes I'll leave some of my
favorite sites down below for false
lashes but fluffing whispies by velour
are some of my faves and then one thing
I'm going to do you can see how I have
like this gap right here just because my
eye kind of goes in and when you put
false lashes on it kind of accentuates
that so I'm going to take this wet and
wild felt tip liner it's a really really
thin liner I like this kind of liner for
this part because it's really thin at
the tip and it's not a brush tip so I
have more control I personally like
felt-tip liners a lot more than brush
tips because I like the control so I'm
just going to gently put a line right
here from the end of the lash to my tear
duct area to kind of give it that more
almond shape
so that is what it looks like it just
makes it look a little bit more natural
if you feel like it looks a little funny
in the inner corner try putting a little
bit of liner there just to kind of even
everything out and make it look like
there's like a band right there as well
you know that is it for the eyes I love
them they're super bright just my kind
of eye so now we are going to move on
okay so for the face I'm going to share
with you guys my favorite like long
wearing products first things first is
primers primers are so important and I
consider this as a primer I just apply
this before any face makeup and this is
the benefit matte rescue and this is
great if you have oily skin if you don't
have oily skin you could totally skip
this step but I like it because I feel
like it does help modify my face and it
also helps with pores
I have larger pores super oily skin just
some problem areas so I love this I'll
apply it all over my face and then I'll
go in with my Smashbox primer and then
another pore minimizer and we'll move on
to foundation ok next primer I'm going
to use is a Smashbox primer water really
like this because I feel like it adds a
lot of hydration it is oil free so
doesn't make me extra oily or anything
like that throughout the day I just like
the hydration and the way that
foundation applies after I use this
product so that's why I've gone through
like six seven of these they're just so
good and then I'm going to be using this
this is the Estee edit by Estee Lauder
pore vanishing stick I've been really
liking this I think this is so cool
I'll just apply this directly on my
pores which is pretty much where my
rosacea is and then I'll take my fingers
and just blend that out I take it right
here in the creases of my nose and just
right on my nose as well and right up my
cheeks so the foundation I'll be using
today I need a long wear foundation and
this is the one I always go to if I'm
going to be outside if I'm going to be
out doing things for a really long time
but have an event I always use this
foundation Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation and I love this I didn't
expect to love it as much as I do but
this is so good and this is the
definition of full coverage like folk
real so I'm going
- a 29 and 25 this is the shade 29 and
all you need is just a few dots like you
literally don't need that much of this
foundation because it is so intense and
a little bit goes such a long way but
since I have to mix these normally I
don't mix but kind of in between a bunch
of shades right now so I have to mix
this foundation might be a little light
for me but I'm going to go ahead and
take this artist brush this is the
oval-8
I've been using this with this
foundation and I'm just obsessed with it
so I'm just going to take this brush and
apply this foundation all over and you
can just see how full coverage this
thing is it is so intense so I'm just
going to be careful right by the
eyeshadow if you've never tried this
foundation I would definitely try it out
I know a lot of the shades are more
yellow toned and if you have that issue
there's a NYX foundation mixer that is
more warm so you can mix it in with the
foundation to give you more of a warm
tone if that's what you need look at
that one side of my face like rosacea
looking crazy my nose is so intense and
this side it's like what you have
rosacea I would've never guessed if you
just have a lot to cover I would
recommend this foundation if you have
perfect skin I would skip this one
because it's so intense unless that's
the kind of look that you want
then all means go for it because I'm a
full coverage kind of person - I don't
like BB creams really or anything like
that I like a full coverage finish and
this is where it's at so I've been
trying out a bunch of new products
lately and some of my favorite products
I've been trying are these Smashbox
color correcting Stix I do really like
this green one I think this green one is
awesome but I haven't tried this one
it's the look less tired light it's just
like the peachy color this is kind of
the peachy one I'm just going to apply a
little bit of this underneath my eyes to
brighten up a little bit so I'm just
going to take my baby blender and blend
that out underneath the eye
like that it has a peachy tint to it but
once you put your concealer on top you
won't be able to tell some people use
red lipstick underneath their eyes it's
really all just about like what you need
and your preferences I don't have super
bad dark circles so I don't need to go
with an intense orange or an intense red
I mean I could if I wanted to do it for
fun but I don't have to I've also been
using this Urban Decay one which is in
the color peach as well this is so nice
I love this but today we're going to be
using a new concealer I've never tried
this one but I heard it's a lighter
coverage so it's good to kind of correct
and then apply this on top but this is a
chart type performance Naturals
rainforest of the sea aqua concealer
like I said I've never tried it but
hopefully it's good I like the
applicator of it it's like a little doe
foot well it's not little it's a huge
doe foot but we're just going to apply
this like I would my other concealers I
hope it's good
it definitely smells like concealer then
again I'm going to take my Beauty
Blender and just pull in this out
mmm oh my god I'm so picky with
concealer I always use the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer it's just my fave I
think it's amazing and it's been hard
for me to get away from it this one
doesn't look like it's going to be one
of my favorites just because it's really
yellow like I didn't expect it to be
this yellow of a concealer and this is
in the shade light/medium yes I mean it
looks really nice but I don't know if
this is going to be one of my favorites
or not and if you want to know I'm
actually medium light neutral in the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
ahead and set this concealer pretty much
right away I'm going to use the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder I
want to get the brightening powder so
let me know if you guys have tried that
I've wanted that for so long like ever
since I started youtube I really wanted
it so I'm just going to take my Beauty
Blender and we're going to bake and I
never baked but I've been doing it
lately and I really like the way that my
makeup turns out so I'm just going to
take this underneath my eyes and like
down my cheek as well this is really
gonna help everything stay and I find
that baking really helps with the oil
coming through it makes you not get as
shiny as quick now what I'm gonna do is
I'm just going to move on to brows so
then this can all set we could dust it
away and work on bronzer and everything
I've been using a dip brow and soft
brown and I've been loving it again I
was using the Ardell pomade which are
really really good for some reason I
just wanted to try the Anasazi own one
again and I've just been really loving
it she's so nice I see how much I've
used this product like I've had this
baby for a while my first one dried out
really quickly but this one's just going
strong and hello I see some pan down
there you guys probably can't see it but
let's hit pan so I'm just gonna fill in
my brows I kind of follow the natural
shape of my brows I extend them out just
a little bit like that and then I will
bring it in to the inner part right here
I don't do anything too crazy honestly
just because I feel like brows are my
least favorite part like I love the way
they look afterwards but actually doing
them
kinda like it's on my nerves cuz I feel
like I want to move on to lips or
bronzer and browser like in my way
they're not my absolute favorite to do
on my face but they make the biggest
difference brows or just they're so nice
when they're done brows are just so like
tedious
I guess it's why I don't really like
them as much I'm just like get it done
that's why I don't use like a pencil or
anything because I feel like using a
pencil I used to use the brow is but it
took me so long and I feel like pomades
are just easier because you can fill in
so much more in a shorter amount of time
and this brush from Tarte is a life
saver if I don't have this brush I'm
questioning if I shave into my brows and
then to set the brows i'm also using
anasazi I've been using this for so long
it's the brow gel in brunette just so
good
and it really makes your brows look more
natural I just I can't go without this
product because I love how it just gives
like highlights to the brow in a way and
it really helps match my hair a lot
better so now we're going to clean up
and get rid of this bakery that we just
did I feel like I would much rather have
my face a little bit lighter then a
little bit darker because what I gotta
do is take some bronzer and ron's up the
skin to make everything better again so
I'm going to use a different browser
today that I got in PR this is the Too
Faced sweethearts bronzer and it's in
sweet tea so this is what looks like I
have swatched it but I haven't actually
put out my face I'm just hoping it's not
like super shimmery or anything and I'm
going to use this benefit brush that I
am obsessed with I'm going to just hit
the higher points of my face pick it
down the side of my face since my face
is a little bit lighter my takes them
right here just to kind of make the
color not look so intense and take some
of my cheeks oh I like this bronzer
looks so nice
moving on to contour I'm going to use
the L'Oreal infallible Pro contour and
I'm using the shade medium 8 1/4 I'm
going to take this Sonia Kashuk brush
this is a really nice contour brush and
I'm going to draw this underneath my
cheekbone and just blend it upwards
don't blend it downwards this brush is a
little stiff but it does apply the
product exactly where you want it and it
does blend it out really well so I think
it's good it's a great alternative to
the NARS eat a brush if you don't want
to spend that much money on a brush one
point I quit using the NARS Eden was
just using this because I like how
precise it is okay so for blush I'm
using this NYX one in bronze just looks
like that and I take my blush brush and
just tap it in there and lightly go over
the cheeks now we're going to blend that
out just to make it look a little more
subtle
then highlighter I'm going to use my
favorite highlighter of the moment it is
the Charlotte Tilbury gold bar what is
this called bar of gold highlighter this
is so nice and just I love this I think
the gold highlight with the orange eyes
is just beautiful so I'm going to use
this Anasazi brush I have been loving
for highlight see how Nastasia a23 I'm
just going to apply this right to the
top of the cheekbone and right here up
towards the brow I'm going to take that
same highlighter and put it underneath
my brow I just love taking the same
highlighter as I use on my face for my
brows I feel like it just sinks together
so nicely also put some in the inner
corner to brighten that up and then for
the waterline I'm going to use that same
Y eyeliner m-16 just gonna put this on
my waterline just like that then I'm
going to take a pencil brush and that
same darker orange color right here just
going to blend this out on my lower lash
line
feel like this orange eyeshadow really
brings out the gold highlights then I'm
going to apply mascara to my lower
lashes just to kind of finish the eyes
off if you feel like you put on too much
mascara on your bottom lashes or just
looks a little clumpy take your finger
and wiggle it back and forth lightly on
the lashes and it will help separate and
get rid of that excess product so I
wanted to do something a little bit more
dramatic with this look and I wanted to
use 22 the Box looks a little more red I
was hoping it was more orange but we
will see yeah it's Swede
I feel like it looks more orange in the
packaging than it does on the Box anyway
so I'm going to use the lip liners my
first time ever using this so let's open
could creamy Lika
this is gonna be bold and I'm like so
pumped for it Oh hmmm I don't like the
smell
I really like the color it dries down to
like it's orange but it's not too orange
like I would wear it so I bought it
though of course you could do more of a
neutral lip I think this is fun
like it's so orange and bright I likey
this dried down so quick and it's like
you can't even feel it it's even when
you rub your lips together it just feels
not even like velvet it just feels like
nothing so far I'm liking that it feels
really good that is it for this video I
hope you guys enjoyed this don't forget
to give it a thumbs up if you did I will
see you all in my next video bye yeah
we're at the bowling alley now
we just ended with a barbecue taking my
shoes off we just got done with a
barbecue and now we're going to ball</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
