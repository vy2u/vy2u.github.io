the start of a new series on my channel
which is called bought it forgot it
basically what it's about is products
that I've purchased and just basically
forgot about it don't use them enough
and I'm gonna go through my drawers each
month and pick out different things that
I really don't use often and put them
into this little box and incorporate
them in my daily routines and then at
the end of the month I will update you
guys on if I feel like I should have
bought it if I just you know regret it
if I love it so and I just want to say
thank you to Ashley joy she actually
came up with the title bought it forgot
it
we had a Facebook poll on my Facebook
page but you haven't liked it yet I will
link it down below because they do
things like this ever so often and she
came up with the name and I absolutely
love it and also I did pick the winners
for my iwatch thank you giveaway I have
messaged them on YouTube so if you're
interested in seeing who they are I
believe their usernames down below and
if you were a winner please get back to
me as soon as possible thank you guys so
much for you know entering that contest
keep in mind there will be more in the
future so don't be sad if you didn't win
yeah let's just go ahead and get started
with this video so let's start with
pallets the first pallet I want to start
incorporating more is this new tube
palette from the balm I got off a hook
look a while back and I just never used
it I don't think I've even swatched this
thing so I need to use this more and
like I said this is from the balm and
it's called the nude tude palette that
one is a lorac Pro palette a lot of you
probably seen this so really well-known
a palette here on YouTube but I do love
the palette I just don't use it enough
so that's basically the idea for are all
these products I'm gonna show you guys
next is the NARS Dan Murray palette I've
had this for a couple years now you can
see it just has four blushes a highlight
and bronzer and I'm used to any to use
these more I used to love sin a lot but
you know I just forget about them
because if you've seen that my blush and
bronzer drawer you know why I probably
forgot about them
speaking of blushes and bronzers the
first bronzer I'm gonna try to use more
is the Chanel selected a Chanel bronzer
and this is like a cream bronzer but
it's like a cream to powder thing but
this one's really expensive so I
definitely had to include it because in
these
be put to use another one is this Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer another
really well-known one again I used to
use this a lot and then I just kind of
moved on different things so it looks
like it's about to hit pan soon because
I could see the rings around it so
hopefully I can hit pan on it maybe use
it up this month I have to NARS blush is
this one again used to love it's deucer
and it's just a really pretty natural
mommy shade eye I just really love it
and then this one's Lovejoy which is
kind of a darker but blush but it does
look really really nice then this is
actually when I purchased recently this
is a Smashbox
halo longer blush and this is impassion
I got it and I haven't used it yet and
pretty sure it still has the little
thingy on it let's see and I keep them
in the box because they're really messy
yeah I still have the thing on it um as
for primer I threw in the benefit stay
flawless 15-hour primer I use this like
twice I think and I was not impressed
because it broke in half so when I got a
new one I just did never use it I'll sit
through my maybelline instant age rewind
this one's in lights hopefully I can use
this up because it's right down here at
the near bottom so hopefully I can use
this up man's Lucent crystal powder I
bought this and I just haven't been
using it a lot I've been loving me Mac
one more so I just I need to use this it
was really expensive Oh another blush I
have is this Sigma cramtucket or cherry
apple I used this a couple times a while
back and I really liked it so I'm going
to throw it in and kind of incorporate
it more okay I have three liners I have
the Maybelline Line stiletto which I
forget what this looks like
it just has like a felt tip like the
lore'l a mere liner so I threw that in
here I also want to try to use this up
this is the Mac eye pencil in smolder
and then you have the NYX the curve
which I used around this time last year
so maybe I can use it up I also have the
rocket mascara from Maybelline I really
do like this mascara the only thing that
sucks is taking it off because it's
really hard to take off but I do like it
so I want to use it and maybe try to use
it up and kind of get my wire sell wanna
break I'll
to have an EVE pearl salmon concealer
and might wanna try to use this more I
have quite a few of these in my drawer
and I just you know I need these enough
I have a Chanel single eyeshadow I've
had this for literally years this is an
amethyst it's literally the prettiest
purple color because it has like a hint
of blue so pigmented and creamy oh my
gosh it's really pretty shade I just
never use it so I'm gonna try to use it
up more have to steal ones the first one
is in kitten I've raved about this a lot
I love it but again I just forget about
it
it's a really pretty shape the only
thing about these eyeshadows is they do
have a ton of Fallout and then the other
one I have here is terracotta which is a
beautiful shade I mean just stunning I
also want to use I haven't used this yet
the Revlon Colorstay eyeshadow quad and
adventurous just had like a green a dark
brown and like a gold shade so I want to
use that and see how it liked it and
then I threw in this quad just because I
love this quad I just forget about it
and I want to do a video on it I meant
to do it when the collection first came
out this is the Maybelline eye studio
limited edition quad and desert fantasy
I love the gold and the green in this
quad they're really really pretty and
then last thing are lip products I have
two chroma lip pencil in baby doll and
modern mauve and these are really nice I
just again you know how it is it's kind
of like oh you just forget about things
so I'm gonna try to use those up they're
really nice and pigmented and then the
last thing I'm gonna try to use which I
haven't used before is the L'Oreal LeMat
in matte for me there's just a really
pretty red color and again I haven't
used it I've just watched it and it
seems really nice so I'm excited to try
this out because I'm really into matte
shades lately so you guys are excited

fun and it's gonna help me kind of use
