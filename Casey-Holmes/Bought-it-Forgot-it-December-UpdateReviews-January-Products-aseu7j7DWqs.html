bought it forgot update for January and
I'm also showing you guys the products
I'll be using for February and let me
just say I haven't been able to talk
about bought forgot since I put up that
video in the beginning of December so
yeah I take that back about I forgot it
for December I just said January I want
to just quickly say thank you guys for
the people who supported the series um
it was very mixed emotions with that
video basically I mean I loved it
because literally after I filmed that
video I had so many tweets coming in
with pictures of your body I forgot it's
and that you loved the idea and you were
gonna start using your products more
that you forgot about this is not in any
way a bragging video you know you don't
have to have a large collection you
don't have to have a small collection
isn't it doesn't have to be high-end
it doesn't have to be drugstore it's
just all about using products that you
put on the backburner and I think it's
cool to come on camera and be like if
this is what I'm gonna use for the month
this is what I'm gonna use and as you
guys saw last month I did quite a few
few videos using a lot of my bought it
forgot it products so I mean I've
rediscovered some products fell in love
with products again and that's what this
video is all about and especially being
a beauty blogger you know I buy a lot of
things to do reviews and to you know try
new things out for you guys sometimes
when I do that I forget about products
that I already have and that I love I'm
not saying that I don't love certain
products just some things don't get
enough plugs so I just wanna put that
out there really quickly before this
video because a lot of people got
offended by it and it's not supposed to
be offensive this is just a video to
hopefully inspire you to you know go in
your makeup collection and find things
that you just kind of neglect and want
to use up or use more of take it how you
want if you don't like these videos you
don't have to watch them but to me it
does help me go through certain products
and I like the ideas if you like the
idea then give it a thumbs up thank you
guys again for the people who supported
the idea and we're so sweet about it
because there was a lot of mixed
emotions surprisingly I was very
surprised also um some of these items
that I completely did not use keep in
mind I do give a lot of it to my friends
actually
my friend coming over tomorrow and I'm
gonna let her like a raid through the
stuff that I have in my bag because I
keep a bag full of makeup products that
I'm giving away I give it away to my mom
my cousins my friends my family I give
it away to everybody but some of these
items I've decided I I have sanitized
them so don't worry and a lot of them I
won't give away but like there's like
one or two items that I do want to give
away to you guys did a poll on Facebook
and I said something about you know I
there were certain problems I just did
not go to for my body forgotten and so I
no longer want to keep them on my
drawers anymore
just because I you know if I'm not gonna
use it why keep it why not just give it
to somebody who will use it so I will be
doing a giveaway on my Facebook page I
like an eyeshadow palette or what not
something that I just completely do not
use I didn't want to do a blog sale I
feel like that's just I have no need to
do a blog sale I would much rather not
take your money and give you a product
you know give something to somebody that
would actually use it and love it and
adore it because sometimes I buy things
and I'm like oh we use this all the time
and I just end up not using it because I
don't love it cuz I asked everyone on
Facebook I was like do you think it's
gross would you want me to do it I mean
if I sanitized it I wouldn't give away
like lipstick glosses mascara liners
anything like that just like me I shadow
palette and a lot of you said it was
fine giving away sorry who would
actually use it so that's what I'll be
doing on my facebook page so if you're
interested in that the link will be
below I hope you guys are excited for
that but after that like ten-minute
intro let's get into what we need to
talk about first up I'm going to show
you guys the products that I did use a
love for December the first thing I
actually mentioned this in my favorites
video is the lorac Pro palette I did not
show this one enough love and I have
made some serious dent in these
eyeshadows absolutely adore this now I'm
literally going to this every day I just
think it's a beautiful palette and I'm
so happy that I am now using it a ton
because even today I was using this
Urban Decay and our key face case and I
needed some transition shades
like shade so I went to this palette and
I was good to go nice thing I also
mentioned in my favourites video it is
this Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer
I love this bronzer is so beautiful I
think it's perfect but this is awesome
this is definitely one of my top three
bronzers I just I adore it
next up we have my NARS products I fell
back in love with my NARS items I mean I
just love to Lovejoy Lovejoy was amazing
as well as deucer do sir do sir down sir
girl I don't even know what it's called
but I absolutely adore these colors this
looks super dark but I promise you with
a light hand it is stunning on the skin
I've seen a lot of fair-skinned people
that have loved this and I know darker
skin tones would love this as well
Lovejoy's beautiful deucer dowser
whatever is stunning as well and they
just come in so many different looks and
then to my NARS Dan Mari palette this
was from a couple years ago and I love
this it was like a year to go I don't
know I've been on YouTube for two years
now this is January so it's probably two
years ago but I love this I'm just
obsessed sin has been a favorite orgasm
has been a favorite super orgasms just a
little too glittery for me this is a
nice highlight it's not my favorite but
it's nice I have Casino in a big pan so
I don't really go to this one as much
but sin and orgasm have been my
favorites this one will be a favorite
probably in the summer months but it's a
little too bright for the winter time
next product I've been loving is the
Sigma cramtucket or cherry apple blush
now I didn't not use this enough I just
wanted to use it more it's one of those
shades that I feel like you have to have
the right eye look for this like a rosy
red and it's so gorgeous it gives you
that kind of flush like you've been out
in the cold and you're just coming back
inside
I love Sigma blushes honestly they're so
pigmented very creamy
they look so smooth on the skin and I
just I really love this cherry apple it
is stunning I think it is perfect for
the winter time another blush that is
perfect for the winter time is a
Smashbox passion blush this is a very
rosy color it kind of makes you look
like you have that natural flush again
like
came in from outside I love this super
smooth as well the only thing about
these blushes is that they are very very
messy so I keep mine in this packaging
that it came in okay
another item that I used a lot but I'm
gonna have to quit using because it is
old and it just dried out on me and it's
just not working anymore is the
Maybelline the rocket mascara I think I
quit using this about halfway through
December just because it just dried out
and just it was just too old so this is
an awesome mascara though it's hard to
take off you just need a really good eye
makeup remover but otherwise it's
beautiful definitely what we purchased
this okay moving on to things I didn't
use as much okay so this I actually used
once I used it in my yearly favorites
video I did a smokey eye with it I love
it but I only used it once but I really
do like the colors it's just not
something that I continuously went back
to just because I had these sort of
shades in my lorac Pro palette but it's
beautiful I mean if you're looking for a
really nice drugstore palette and
recommend this one I think it's stunning
I'm putting less products in my bought
it forgot it I learned after the
December one because I just noticed that
there were so many that I couldn't use
them all the time and it was just like I
kind of got confused so I'm doing less
products from now on in these broad
forgotten videos another thing I didn't
use much but I did like was this
Maybelline line stiletto this is very
dried out so this will be getting tossed
but it is a really great liner it has a
thicker felt tip it reminds me of the
L'Oreal linear intense liner with how
thick the felt tip is this is a very
black liner I just use this for a long
time enjoyed it and yeah it's just old
and dried out but it would definitely
repurchase this after I used up some
liners another liner I want to talk
about is this Mac eye Kohl and smolder
this is a very black liner anything
about this is it does smudge underneath
the lower lashes and kind of out here in
the outer corner and this did burn my
eyes I notice that it burned my eyes a
lot so I won't be using this anymore
I don't like how it burns I don't know
if it's because it's old or if it's just
the formula but this little guy will be
getting tossed as well this is the NARS
translucent crystal like reflecting
loose powder
I like this but I wish I wouldn't spend
the money on it I don't think it's worth
it I don't see anything special about it
and it did cause a white cast underneath
my eyes because I did use this to set my
under eyes it kind of looks like a white
film on top and I didn't like that I
just don't think this powder is worth
the money in my opinion I didn't notice
a huge difference so this one I might
continue to use I just really hated the
white film that left underneath my eyes
I might give this to my mom or something
because she might like it I don't know I
just don't think it's worth the money to
be completely honest and this is a lot
of product to go through and I know I
won't go through it so I'll probably
give this to somebody who will give it
some love so I do love this deal I
shadow Terra Cotta use it like once or
twice and it's a beautiful shade so
pigmented I just didn't use it that much
this month this is like one of my go-to
colors for like summer oh I love it this
is like a favorite of mine so I do love
this I do like these chroma lip pencils
I think I need to just keep these in my
purse to use them more because they're
just the stick form so they're easy to
travel with and the colors are awesome
for me to actually use these I need to
toss them in my purse for what I want to
do touch-ups so yeah I wouldn't
repurchase them but they are nice but
they don't I will say that they don't
last a long time on your lip so that's
just my opinion
things I either didn't like or just did
not use I did not use this L'Oreal
Willam at-at oh the only thing I have
done with this is swatched it I just
love MAC lipsticks for red so no it's
just one of those things that I just I
didn't go to I know my friend will love
this so I'm gonna give it to her she
loves Reds and I think she would adore
this so I'm gonna give this to her yeah
I just I didn't use a lot I have to be
honest with you hi for buying that
another thing this one's just old this
is the Chanel eyes shadow and amethyst
this just needs to be tossed
it's a you tipple color that like
seriously it's absolutely stunning
it's just old it needs to go I don't
even want to tell you how old this is
but I didn't use it much because it's
just super old
these are the products that I absolutely
don't like I I mean I oh I'm just kind
of explain
so stay flawless 15-hour primer I don't
like this I don't notice a huge
difference first one I had broke and
then they sent me this one our Sephora
sent me another one because I called and
complain and I don't like it I don't
think there's anything special about it
I don't think it makes my makeup lasts
any longer so this will be going to my
friend as well I just don't think is
worth it for me I don't think I didn't
notice a huge difference and I think
it's just it's not my favorite I haven't
met rather have the benefit
Porefessional than this one I use this
palette only in that video and I'm just
I'm not digging it and uh it's just not
my favorite palette so it's the new tude
from the balm I'm just not a big fan I
don't necessarily like the way the eye
shows or layout it kind of gives me OCD
with how crooked they are I just don't
like it
I think the shades are pretty but they
come off a little different on your lid
like this silly shade I thought was
gonna be a gorgeous brown with like the
burgundy specks in it but it turned out
just to be like a regular brown shadow
so it wasn't anything special the only
eye shadow I do like in here is sexy
because it's a gorgeous burgundy color
but that's no reason to keep this whole
palette so this is gonna be the product
that I do give away on my Facebook page
just because I don't use it I mean it's
just not one of my favorite palettes
this one's a hard one for me I spent a
lot of money on it and I don't know at
one point I used it and I was like oh my
god obsessed I absolutely adore it and
like I couldn't stay away from it like I
used it all the time but now when I use
it I just don't see what I saw in it
like does that make sense I hope it does
like I don't see what I used to see in
it oh it's so hard to show this because
it's so expensive and it crin I mean it
makes me cringe but it's decent late in
a Chanel bronzer and I don't know maybe
I'm not using it right I don't know I
use it with a duo fiber brush I use it
to bronze up my face if I want more of a
natural look which it is beautiful for
that but let's be real
I don't really go for the natural look
all the time a lot of the times I'm
filming almost every day so I go pretty
much glam with my makeup I don't know it
smells really good I don't know let me
know your favorite ways to use this in
the comments below because I can't give
this away I don't I can't look at that
I'm at that point where I can't give it
away just because it was so expensive I
need to figure out ways to use it so if
you have favorite ways to use this
product leave it in the comments below
cuz I would love to hear I want to try
to use this and get back to loving it
the way I used to and I would love to
hear your suggestions on different ways
to use this product if you have it
because I know it's a great product
don't get me wrong but I just don't love
it like I used to okay so now that that
long part is over I'm going to quickly
show you guys the products I'm going to
start trying to use for January so first
off we have this powder I love this
powder but I have so many I just forget
about it it's the urban decay beast like
powder I got this off of hautelook so I
got to add a really good deal and it's
just a translucent powder same goes for
this powder it's a Clinique invisible
matte powder just to keep you Matt I
just want to use this more try to use
these up during the months because I use
powder a lot so hopefully I can hit some
panel these next I have my shadow
palettes I have this BH Cosmetics and
Malibu palette I haven't even used this
at all but I want to try and use it more
especially since spring and summer will
be here before you know it so I want to
try these out has a bunch of different
colors in here so this is in the
palettes for this month along with this
one from Urban Decay this is the vegan
palette and I bought this for ever go
off of hope look and I love the shades I
used to use half-baked and smog all the
time so I'll probably get back into
these this month and try to experiment
to like herb and gunmetal they're really
pretty shade so and then this is the
last palette I'm using in here it's the
BH party-girl palette I did purchase
this a while back just haven't showed it
enough love so I can do like more
affordable looks for you guys this month
using the two BH palettes that I have in
here and this one has so many different
shades oh I'm so sorry about my hair but
this one has so many different shades
and I'm excited to try it
really really affordable so be on the
lookout for this a lot this month okay
for bronzer I just have one it's this
Tarte hotel heiress bronzer I do like it
it's a little more on the red side but
I'm going to see if I can work with it
and make it a nice contour shade and
yeah I just haven't shown enough love
again
got this off HauteLook coat look gets me
every time I'm not even lying I think
that's even where I bought my BH party
girl and then three blushes this benefit
coralista I do like this I think it's a
little sheer not as pigmented as I
wished but I love coral shades so I'm
gonna try to pop this on my cheeks a lot
more this month another one this used to
be one of my favorites loved it it's
milania's blush and sweet rose I got
this a while back for 75% off and I want
to use it more it's just a beautiful
beautiful shade I love this color so
this will definitely be in some videos
at this month this is a bronzer - I just
forgot it just looks like the blushes to
me this is the Jordana classic bronze
blush powder they say it's blush but
it's a very bronzer shade more of a
bronzer I'm gonna see if I can use this
to contour and things like that so I'm
excited to use this and your very
affordable I just haven't really shown
it any love just because I've been
caught up with other bronzers so I'm
excited to see if this will probably
work as an affordable contour shape okay
