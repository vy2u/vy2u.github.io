a tutorial on this look and this is a
look that I had in my may favorites
video and I had a ton of requests from
you guys to actually film a tutorial on
this and they also had a lot of requests
on this picture that I posted on
Instagram so I figured I would go ahead
and film that for you guys today
because this is one of my favorite
eyeshadow combos whenever i sat down to
do my makeup the day I filmed the main
favourites I was like I'm just gonna
play around with some of my favorite
shadows and also use the one that I
haven't used very much which is called
tempting from Mac I hope you guys enjoy
this is actually pretty easy to achieve
I try to make my tutorials pretty easy
so that the average girl can do these
looks blending and stuff obviously takes
practice and this is just a technique I
like to do I just like to try to make
tutorials pretty easy for you guys
because I don't want to get too
technical and then it get a little bit
confusing or hard for you so I hope you
guys enjoy this if you recreate this
look or something like it then please
hash tag me on instagram at kc HL 91 or
send it to me on twitter or my facebook
page and don't forget to like this video
if you liked it and by the way I did
switch up some products but for the most
part it's basically the same looks I
just wanted to feature some newer
products that is purchased recently so
thank you guys so much for watching and
let's go ahead and get on to the
tutorial so I've already primed my eyes
and I will leave my regular primers down
below in the description box if you're
interested in them but I'm gonna take a
soft brown from Mac and put this all in
our crease and even on the lid and I'm
using these Sigma e-40 just to blend
this out all over this is just gonna be
our transition shade so it fades to the
brow really nicely
then we're gonna put tape on the outer
corners of our I just following the
lower water line up towards our brow
this will make it easier to get a nice
clean line and then I'm taking that
tempting eyeshadow from Mac with the Mac
242 and I'm just going to apply this all
over the lid and I apply this quite a
few times just because I want it to be
really nice and vibrant and this color
is just so pretty I mean oh I cannot get
over it so I'm just gonna pack this on
the lid until I'm completely satisfied
and then going in with a brown script
I'm going to place this directly in the
crease and I'm going to put it right
above where I put that tempting
eyeshadow don't be afraid to take this
color or any of the colors over the tape
that's what the tape is there for to
help you get that nice clean line so you
could be as messy as you want I'm gonna
take this color all the way to the inner
corner as well and this will really help
smoke everything out
then I'm going to take the Sigma e-40
and I'm gonna run it right over the edge
of that brown script just to kind of
smooth it out a little bit so there's no
harsh lines and then I'm going to touch
up that tempting eyeshadow just to make
sure that it's nice in in your face and
then I will do a little bit more
blending as well then I'm gonna go in
with carbon in this little dome brush
and I ended up not loving carbon the
only reason why I used it was because it
was in the palette that I was working
from so I ended up going into the lorac
Pro palette and it in the black from
there because carbon just wasn't cutting
it for me so here I'm using that lorac
Pro palette black shade and I'm just
going to place this right in the outer V
I don't want to bring this in too far at
all and I am NOT going to be taking this
above Brown script so make sure you keep
this below that Brown script color and
just really focus on putting this in the
outer V a little bit on the lid and just
a tad bit in the crease this is just
gonna help really smoke out this look
and deepen it up and I'm just going to
go in with a clean blending brush and
blend this out again you want to focus
this in the outer V don't bring it too
far on the lid
then going back in with the Sigma e-40
I'm again just going to run this brush
over the shadow just to make sure I
don't have any harsh lines and then just
take off the tape and rubbing your
eyeshadow is done so now we're going on
to primer I'm using the Smashbox photo
matte primer my skin has been going
crazy ever since I got some Sun on it it
is so dry but it's still super oily so
I'm having a really tough time with it
so that's why my skin doesn't look as
great as normal and I am breaking out so
I just can't win I'm going to take the
hourglass primer as well and just put
this all over my skin because it is a
really nice primer and then taking the
l'oreal true match foundation i'm did
mix w5 and w6 and i'm just going to
apply this all over my skin
going in with concealer I'm taking this
Mac Pro and concealed palette since I do
have some blemishes and I'm just going
to be concealing those with that
concealer and those are the studio
finish concealer Ziff you're wondering
and they're amazing for covering up any
blemish you might have and then I'm
taking the NARS radiant creamy concealer
in custard medium custard I believe and
I'm just going to be blending this out
and I'm also gonna take that same
concealer and highlight the center of my
face with it just to kind of balance out
the under-eye highlights
then I want to take my laura mercier
translucent setting powder and just set
everything in place going on to contour
I'm using something different today that
I've purchased recently this is the
makeup forever sculpting duo I guess you
could say it's in shade number two and I
love the contour in this just beware
though it is super super super pigmented
so all you need is a very light dusting
of this like seriously you don't need a
lot at all
so I'm just taking my NARS eita brush
and contouring my cheeks and underneath
my jaw and my lip and then for my
forehead I will be using something
different
I'll be using a bare minerals bronzer
that came in a kit and I've been really
loving this to bronze up my forehead and
not do like a super strong contour so
I'm just gonna take my Marc Jacobs
bronzer brush and just put this on my
forehead just to kind of make it look
not so large
I'm also going to take this and drag it
on to my cheeks as well whatever excess
I had and then I'm taking Mac's blush
and cantaloupe you guys know I'm
obsessed with this I can't get enough of
it I use it all the time I'm going to be
applying this to my cheeks and then
blending out with a duo fiber brush as
well for highlight I'll be taking this
new one I got this is the Bobbi Brown
shimmer break in beige shout out to my
girl Amanda she mentioned this in one of
her videos recently and it is so
freaking beautiful I love it so if
you're watching this Amanda I'm obsessed
and I'm also applying this with the bare
minerals brush that came with the
bronzer kit and then I'll be going in
and contouring my nose just because it
needs to be contoured I'll be applying
lashes and liner I ended up using the
Inglot liner because this one was just
not cutting it for me and the velour
lashes I used work girl you crazy
because you guys know they're my
favorite I'm just in love with them and
now I'm taking the Sigma brow pencils
and applying this on my brows these have
been my favorite products lately so I'll
leave them down below the names and
everything like that I'm just using the
darker shade on the outer portion of my
brow and then the lighter shade on the
inner part I do have a full brow
tutorial I'll link it down below as well
as a liner and lashes tutorial if you're
interested and now I'm taking the Mac
brow gel that I just got recently in my
last haul and I'm setting my brows with
this
going in with shroom from Mac favorite
highlight of all time I swear I don't
think I've used any other highlight ever
since I got this a few months ago it's
just my favorites that I'm going to be
highlighting right underneath that brow
to lift it up and also in the inner
corners of my eyes just to brighten that
up a little bit as well going back in
with brown script I will be smudging
this underneath my lower lash line with
a pencil brush just go back and forth
with this smoke it out really nicely I
like to drag mine down quite a bit
you don't have to if you don't want to
but I like it to look really nice and
smoky for our liner I'm using the Mac
Pro Longwear liner in black and I'm
going to line my waterline and also my
upper waterline as well and then for
Balan lashes I'm taking the clinic
bottom lash mascara because it's amazing
and I'm obsessed with it
lining my lips with my Mac lip liner and
stripped down I forgot to get close-ups
of these last couple things but I'm
taking stripped down because it's one of
my favorites and it goes with a lot of
different colors and then I got this new
lipstick from Too Faced I can't remember
the exact name but I'll leave it down
below
it's the perfect nude and it has a nice
glossy finish but I wanted to top it off
with this mac lipglass
and peach doc and then you guys are done
