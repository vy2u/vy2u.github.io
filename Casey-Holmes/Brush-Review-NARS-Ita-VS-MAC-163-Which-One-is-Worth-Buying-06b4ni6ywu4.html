a comparison video and I'm going to be
comparing it to different brushes and
I'm gonna let you know which one I
recommend the problems I might have the
benefits you know just all the stuff you
might want to know I figured I would do
a video on it because I pull up this Mac
one thinking that it would be similar to
the NARS one but they are completely
completely different and I know I
mentioned this one in a couple favorites
videos and I just kind of wanted to let
you know which one I'd recommend if you
had your eye on both of these and didn't
know which one to choose or if you just
wanted to know a little bit more
information about each brush so first up
let's talk about the bristles the
bristles on the Mac brush are a lot
shorter than the one on the NARS brush
and the Mac one is 10 million times more
tense than the NARS when the NARS one is
just free and fluffy and it just wants
to blend out everything but this one is
very dense very precise and kind of
difficult to blend which I'll talk about
that now so I bought this brush because
I really wanted this one but when I went
to order it it was on backorder and I
didn't have it for the longest time so I
couldn't wait and I went ahead and got
this one now I did order it offline I
didn't know really anything about the
brush I didn't check any YouTube reviews
which I probably should have done I
didn't go in store and feel it which I
probably should have done I bought it
and now I do regret it this one is not
user friendly this one is definitely
user friendly the problem that I have
with this one is when I try to contour
with it on right here underneath my
cheekbones it is the most difficult
thing to work with and because the
bristles are so dense whenever I put it
into my hoola benefit bronzer I would
even tap it on my hand a couple times
just to get any excess product off and
when I would go to blend it in literally
where you place your brush is where that
product is going to go and I found it
just so difficult to blend it out
because once that color is there it's
really hard to buff it out with this
brush for some reason I would even blend
it so much that my foundation would
start to break up and it was just a hot
mess and I was not happy with it at all
so I never used this to contour again
because using it was just such a mess
now when I got this one in I was
honestly kind of nervous because when I
bought the map one out
had high hopes for it and it just
totally let me down so I went ahead and
bought this one because it's the one I
wanted originally anyway and it is so
much better the bristles are they're
dense but they're not too dense and then
just fluff around like amazing I just
adore it so much I don't have to blend
as much to get everything nice and
blended out it's just so easy to work
with and I actually like this a lot
better than like the Mac 109 which is
these dome-shaped brushes because
sometimes I find that when you contoured
these sometimes I know it's mainly user
error I know but sometimes I find that
the color drags down towards my jawline
which I don't want it all but I mean
these do work really well so you can see
this is kind of like in a straight line
and I just find it so easy to place it
right where you want a contour blend it
and then bam you have a nice strong
contour you don't have to go in and
sharpen it out even more it just looks
really really good so if you were
looking to purchase these Mac brushes to
contour with I would definitely go with
the NARS one and go try it out maybe
feel it at the NARS counter I don't know
if they have it at the NARS counter but
if they do I would go there and play
with it and just see how you like it
because I just think it's so easy to
work with I think anybody could use it
and it's crazy because I really did kind
of have false hope for this after trying
to Mac one but this one I will never go
back to another contour brush like these
I will stick with this one it's so
lightweight it's super sleek I mean it's
so thin I just I really like it a lot of
these brushes are very expensive which
is why I'm telling you you know I would
choose this one over these because I
don't want you to waste your money even
though I know I have raved about these I
feel like now I could never go back and
I wish I would have just bought this
brush can have been done with it because
I bought this one off of recommendation
and then I just bought this one because
I was impatient
so that is just my opinion on these two
brushes if you like this video please
give it a thumbs up I will leave both of
these brushes linked in the description
box below if you want more of a dense
brush then go for it I just found it
really difficult to work with I think
they're around the same price but I'm
not sure but I'm thinking so
I enjoyed this video please subscribe to
my channel if you haven't already or if
you have any other questions about the
brush that I'd probably left out then
just leave it in the comments below and
I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
