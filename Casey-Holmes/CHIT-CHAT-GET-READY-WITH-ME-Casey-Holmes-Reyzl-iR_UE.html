gonna be filming a casual get ready with
me I have my armor and shirt from when
we beat Bama so I am just in a t-shirt
and I'm kind of getting ready because I
need to go out and run errands and I
figured I would film this get ready with
me slash Q&amp;amp;A I asked you guys ask me
questions that you had for me on Twitter
so I have a lot to go through so I'm
gonna try out some new products I'm
going to share with you some of my
favorite products at the moment not a
lot of favorites earned here but just
things I've been really liking I also
wanna let you guys know that I'm so
excited I got to a partner with batiste
for this video and share with you their
dry shampoo you guys know I use them all
the time it's really nothing different
so it's really exciting that they wanted
to partner with me because I talk about
this stuff literally all the time for
the past few years so I'm gonna go ahead
and get started don't forget to hit that
subscribe button before you leave and
let's just go ahead and get started
first things first okay let's do dry
shampoo and then I'll talk about these
hair ties that I really like so far this
is gonna be kind of like a random chit
chat video talk to you guys about things
randomly answer your questions just a
chill video so if you're getting ready
let's get ready together our Soph
batiste I'm so excited that they wanted
to work with me because I love this
brand for dry shampoo I have purchased
so many of these you guys have seen them
in numerous hauls and I just love them
the one I'll be using today is for
brunettes so if you have a darker route
like I do like my hair is pretty dark
and then it goes down to blonde because
I did darken up my hair not too long ago
and this is gonna be perfect for you if
you're super super brunette you'll also
like this as well because it does have a
tint to it as you can see they also have
one for blondes and then they have
numerous different types of smells I
feel like all of them smell pretty good
but my favorites are the hint of dark
and then also oh is that other one that
I have it's actually my travel bagg see
it's all the way over there I think it's
like the clean one it's the one with all
the bullion it I like a lot of different
scents from them they also have the
little travel-size ones which I take
with me pretty much everywhere I always
have one like in my purse or whatever
because I'm oily from here up like this
in my entire head is so oily my skin is
oily my hair gets really oily so I
always need dry shampoo honestly I can
go about 3 or 4 days
without washing my hair it's phenomenal
all you want to do is spray it like six
to ten inches away from your head it's
giving me some volume and you just want
to rub it with your fingers you can see
since this one has the tint it's not
gonna leave a white cast and then what I
like to do is just run my fingers
through it and then I pull it back into
a ponytail and let it sit and tell them
don't my makeup and then I brush out my
hair and brush out all that dry shampoo
but you can go ahead and just brush it
out and be done I just like to kind of
let it sit there do its thing and then
I'll work on later moving on
to like my new favorite hair ties it's
all these hair ties on CIFOR and I was
like what the heck is that it kind of
reminds me of like my childhood and like
me putting weird stuff in my hair it's
just invisible I like it Harry
I love this because it really keeps my
hair up but it doesn't like pull it back
so much especially with a bun this holds
my bun in place for a while and I think
it's just because it kind of has it's
not like rubbery but it has like that
grip I guess my bun will stay up all day
it's phenomenal so I love using this for
like ponytails doesn't really put an
indent in my hair either I just wrap it
around twice and I'm good to go but do I
want to do today I have like this
Natasha Damona duochrome
topcoat which I've never used but I
wanted to try it out so I purchased the
green brown one I don't think this will
go with our look today but you never
know I also have this huda beauty mauve
obsessions I think we're gonna use this
this is really pretty I'm gonna go ahead
and take my Smashbox photo-finish lid
primer and put this on I've really been
enjoying this Katrice Aquafresh
highlighting eyeshadows this one and
water lights and also luminous sensation
these are so good I love them I need to
see if they have more colors but then I
also need to try these like coverfx
shimmervale
I've yet to try these as well as the
glitter drops if you guys have the
glitter drops let me know how you use
them because I know you can use them on
your body and stuff but I'm a little
nervous to use them on my face you know
just a little bit so I'm gonna go in
with the huda beauty mob obsessions
little mini palette and I'm going to use
this shade right here I'm gonna miss the
ask desk I'm gonna use that shade to set
my crease do you have some nice matte
shades in here and shimmer shades so I'm
all for it
oh I also I was going to my drawers and
I pulled out the wire sell baby doll
mascara who remembers that mascara and
how much I loved it back in the day is a
splurge first of all how you still love
this mascara so much and I was like you
know what I want to try that today so
that's what we're gonna do I feel like I
have so much new makeup that I only want
to do like full face the first
impressions but I know people get tired
of those so I'm trying to like figure
out ways to use them because I don't
wear makeup every day I wear makeup
mostly when I'm filming or going out
with Davis or something for the most
part I'm like makeup free so the time I
get to try new makeup is when I'm
filming so that's why I do a lot of like
first impressions or hauls well I never
really do halls anymore I miss halls
actually that's why I do so many of
those videos um just because I have a
buttload of stuff to go through I'm
going to go into this one first and
fluff that very lightly into the crease
it seems like it's a pretty pigmented
shade so I'm just going to lightly blend
this I asked you guys on Twitter as well
you know that video going around
following different Beauty vloggers
makeup tutorials or people's tutorials
in general it's just going around and I
was gonna do it but some of you asked me
to recreate my very first makeup
tutorial and I was like I thought about
doing that but like do I need to use the
same products do I just kind of use what
I got be honest I don't want to purchase
all the same products because you know I
just feel like that's a little bit
wasteful like I'm gonna just use it for
the video and be done with it but she's
really pretty it's not too intense right
now and also I'm getting a little sick
now I'm gonna go in with this really
pretty pink tone and the Mac 217 Wow and
blend that into my crease I literally
have no idea what look I want to do
that's pretty normally I'm not into like
Mavi pinks but something about this
palette just looks so pretty I love the
Mac
in here so I haven't been posting a lot
on snapchat like I used to and I was
thinking about last night like I really
don't like the snapchat update and I'm
not one to be super dramatic about
updates you know but I really don't like
this one I just think it's inconvenient
and that's just not my favorite layout
so I was thinking last night
I feel so disconnected from like the
people that watch my snapchat and people
that post snapchats because that's where
like I feel like I'm hanging out with
people if that doesn't sound weird
probably does still love snapchats
filters but I definitely don't go to
snapchat more and like Instagram I like
Instagram stories but I've noticed it
doesn't give you that connection that
snapchat does there's just something
about snapchat that gives you that
connection and I don't get that with
Instagram stories but I still post on
there because I need to post somewhere
you know rip snapchat think it's time to
answer some questions if you were a
makeup product what would you be that's
from Alexa I would totally be a
foundation 100% and you know I'll be
full coverage someone else asked will
you ever bring Rosie days to a store
format like a brick and mortar or just
keep it as an online boutique I've
thought about doing a store in the town
that the boutique is in but I just am
not there yet first of all I'm still
hiring a bunch of different people to
help me out because I by the way I'm
taking this shade right here I started
getting super overwhelmed like it's a
good overwhelmed because we're busy
definitely need more help so I'm still
in the process of hiring people I've
heard a few people to help with like
major things but I don't know if I would
start a store that starting a store is a
lot a lot of work to like I feel like I
got most of the work done for the online
store now it's just like hiring people
and training them to do what's already
in place but when you open a store you
know you got to be there for they're
like people that are building everything
kind of set it all uh it's just it's a
lot more work so probably not for a
while right now I definitely think
online is the better way to go and if
you guys don't know I have it
on Rosi days calm first off I have logo
tees for Rosie days so like if you're
into merch and stuff like that that is
on the website it's nothing that says
like Casey Holmes or its blondie or
stuff like that it's literally just
Rosie days boutique it's cute Comfort
colors every I feel like everybody loves
Comfort colors they're just so casual
and easy to wear it's kind of like this
stuff that I meant like everyday I
created another t-shirt because I love
t-shirts I feel like nobody could have
enough t-shirts and it has a special
logo on it and it has like rose and
Daisy in the state of Georgia I'll put
like a little picture of it right here
but 15% of the sales go to a shelter or
rescue that's in need it'll be a
different one each month I'm really
excited because we're kind of going
towards the end of the month and then I
have to like you know look at the sales
get the percentage out and so far it's
really awesome how many people have
bought the shirts and have been so
supportive so thank you so much we want
to know who are donating to I will leave
my Instagram down below for Rosie days
and out update on there or we donate -
thank you to all of you who have
purchased one the sizes range from small
to 3x so I'm hoping we get more shirts
in before the months over I need a place
in order for the ones we have out of
stock yeah I'm hoping those will come in
soon definitely stay tuned by the way
that color was really pretty I do feel
like it's a little sheer let me see
who'da usually you have to use your
fingers with I would use this with your
finger for sure
so I actually haven't been vlogging for
like the past month maybe month and a
half and I know some people are bummed
out about it but I just it's so
important to stay sane and like a half
time for yourself and to not share
everything on the internet I'm sitting
like this because I don't want it to
transfer even though I love vlogs and I
think vlogs are so fun there just comes
a time where I just need to take a step
back I get it like I am addicted to
YouTube - I have some of my favorites if
some people don't post them like all
that sucks it's so important for people
to have their own time because the
internet just can be so draining
everything can be draining and I noticed
I started to get like you know
frustrated easily my I too kind of
changed there for a little while I was
dressed out with rosy days and trying to
juggle YouTube people were on me for not
vlogging and it's just like it's hard to
tell people you need time without being
like look I'm going to go insane if I
don't have time to myself it's just so
important to know when to stop
when to just hold on take a deep breath
take some stuff off of your plate and
move forward I've been doing YouTube for
years and I really work hard to try to
have like really great content and all
of that I think the hardest part is
trying to have people understand that
understanding like okay I needed a break
I needed to take a moment Allah and also
like mentally underselling yourself like
bitch you need a stock you need to hold
on because otherwise you're gonna go
insane okay I don't know if I like those
cover FX shimmer things because a
they're kind of crumbling when I try to
blend a little bit but they just don't
look very seamless like I still kind of
prefer the steal of once more I will
just stop there because this is not
going anywhere I'm gonna come back and
finish these eyes once I do my face and
then I can find my eyelash curler but
I'm gonna move on to face and I have a
few things here gonna be using the h2o
rapids probiotic modifier this says gel
to powder texture mattifies for visibly
flawless skin tone never uses before
very excited believe this is new after
moisturizing applied to any oily zones
especially are typically forehead nose
and chin apply throughout the day when
it need it just gonna use a little bit
on my cheeks I'm kind of nervous wow
this smells good I don't even know what
it smells like but so a little bit does
go a long way I think I did just use too
much what does it smell like oh my god
it smells so good I don't even know what
color that's more like okay so I feel
like it's completely set it is kind of
like to a powder finish it doesn't have
that selecting anymore which is good now
I'm going to actually go in with this a
Bobbi Brown a vitamin enriched face base
got this in PR first off I was very
excited that I got this in PR because
I've always wanted to try it but
everyone to splurge so I'm very excited
about it it's thicker than I thought it
would be and it is
so moisturizing and cooling big fan of
this I like it a lot I feel like it's a
really great base for your makeup is it
something you should a hundred and
thousand percent spend your money on
probably not there are other primers
that are really great as well but I've
been really really enjoying this it just
keeps your skin nice and moisturized and
really preps the skin for makeup Katie
said you're such a busy person but you
are so great at it what is your best
advice or tools you use to stay
organized how do you find time for you
and Davis um I have not perfected that
yet glad that I look organized I am so
far from it I try to set days for
certain things like Monday Wednesday
Thursday for you to Tuesday Friday for
Rosie days now that I'm hiring some
other people to do a lot of the Rosie
day stuff for me I have more time for
YouTube which is great because then I
can bring back vlogs since I'll have
time for that I honestly don't really
have any tips I mean I'm not that
organized at all I really try to be but
to be honest I have no organization
skills like whatsoever and honestly to
try to find time for Davis and I like
when we went to Montreal it was like
strictly for fun and I didn't work on
anything while I was there I probably
just did a few text messages and things
like that back and forth to people that
work with me for the most part it was
just a vacation for us which was so fun
and great to have I'm still trying to
figure it out I'm not perfect but just
no matter what make sure you have time
for yourself no matter what you're doing
so now I'm using the LA girl Pro matte
foundation I have been really really
loving this foundation I do mix a little
bit of this Catrice prime and fine
makeup transforming drops and I did
purchase more shades which I shouldn't
have done because this works perfectly
fine I really love this foundation so I
mix medium beige and those drops to get
this color that you're seeing now but
they do have more shades on the le girl
I feel like I called this Catrice just a
second ago but it's definitely the Le
girl website la girl cosmetics
also have a new concealer today
from laura mercier to try it's a
flawless fusion ultra long wear
concealer this looks really good so in
the PR kit this is what came in it and
it says concealer that won't crease
medium to full coverage flexes with skin
to seamlessly conceal under eye darkness
and facial imperfections using the doffo
applicator wand
dot under eyes over discolorations blah
blah blah gently pressed and blend with
fingertips probably won't do it my
fingertips and probably won't dot it but
we'll see I always like to try products
the way I like to try them I'm gonna
just do what I normally do in my
concealer and hope it goes well I don't
really dot my concealer under my eyes
but you totally can if you want to okay
so I'm gonna take my Real Techniques
sponge and just push this into my skin
like you're gonna really blend it out
has a really great coverage know what
for shits and giggles I'm just gonna use
my finger on the other side ooh I hate
this yeah I'm just gonna use my sponge
I tried can't say I didn't try you guys
it's been a while since I like really
liked a concealer that claims it's full
coverage because I'm so picky and love
heart shape tape we got a winner here
thank the Lord
this looks really good on the skin I
like it feel like it could get heavy if
you're not careful I did apply a lot
more than I told you to I applied
complete triangles underneath my eyes
and they tell you to do dots but it
actually looks really good someone asked
will you do any more meet-and-greets if
so where and I actually have one coming
very soon may or may not be in the Peach
State so this is the luxury baking a
powder lace and I really like this it
really does melt into the skin and just
look really beautiful I kinda feel like
it's a good alternative to the peach
powder from Too Faced don't get it
twisted though love this powder but this
is really good this does have a nice
tint to it the packaging sucks but but
you know it's fine so it says the
natural heat from your body will cook
the powder over base foundation or
concealer giving you a flawless finish
doesn't look cakey but it really does
melt into the skin
one of those patters that's just so good
set everything kind of has like a
tightening effect to y'all I am sickly
obsessed with Riverdale so I used to be
a real big Real Housewives fan I don't
even haven't even watched that in the
longest time my thing right now is
Riverdale and fixer-upper which I've
always loved fixer-upper but there's
just something about being stuck inside
the house in the winter even though
right now it's like sixty degrees but
there's something about being stuck in
the house in the winter and watching
fixer-upper wanting to fix everything
that I can't fix cuz this isn't my house
and then Riverdale is so good like I
love Riverdale so much that I'm
literally on YouTube looking up cast
interviews because I need more of them
what is y'all's favorite show on like
amazon prime and netflix i also really
liked what was it called i recommended
it to you guys not too long ago oh what
is it called there's another show i love
i'll put it in the screen right here but
it is the funniest show david's and i
watch that in like two days
it's amazing or coming out with another
season which I'm so excited about and I
believe they won a Golden Globes not
surprised because it was such an amazing
show I recommend it I put it in the
screen because some reason I can't think
of it right now okay so now I'm going
and with makeup revolution brow pomade
I've also been loving that Catrice ultra
slim brow pencil that you guys have seen
in my videos but I'm just gonna go ahead
and use a pomade today alright so I did
go in with the medium shade of the ultra
slim met or the slim attak ultra precise
brow pencil from Catrice just to kind of
give us a nice tail but now we are done
with the brows and we're gonna dust away
this baking so we can do my favorite
part actually all of the face makeup is
my favorite okay now I'm gonna take a
peek into this Too Faced mystical
bronzer it's an iridescent mystical
bronzer is this gonna be a practical
bronzer probably not but we're gonna
look at it anyways
very cute packaging I do I'm not like
into unicorns and stuff like that but
this is cute packaging I think it's
really pretty
oh it smells like chocolate
we'll try it looks shimmery no okay
Stephanie a darker bronzer you want to
use a pretty light hand with it
definitely has that iridescent glow
which I'm not the biggest fan of for
bronzer I feel like this just looks
muddy oh man I got running errands
luckily that broke luckily that bronzer
does blend pretty well see what it looks
like on the skin you can see little
specks of glitter from this unicorn
right here this unicorn has some hella
glitter in it I'm just not down with the
iridescent glow I don't know I'm just
not down for it but the bronzer is not
terrible luckily it all blended out so
we're we're completely fine now I'm
gonna go in with this Catrice Sun glow
matte bronzing powder and I'm going to
contour with this one uses wet and wild
brush I'm gonna contour my cheeks a
little bit now I'm just blending
everything with a pear cosmetics brush
and he uses cookie cosmetics blushing
blush palette mixing these two together
because I really like these two together
actually I'll do a little bit of mauve
too because the eyes are kind of purply
so pretty I'm gonna be using the Omri Z
collab with Anastasia
so this is her highlighter with them
really pretty packaging everything about
this is just really elegant and pretty
so I'm just gonna use my honest Asya
eighty-three brush damn girl
that is gorgeous
I really like the color of that I feel
like even as an eyeshadow this is going
to me gorgeous so now I'm gonna curl my
lashes and then I'm also going to go
back in actually with that crazy
highlighter and I'm gonna put this
underneath my brow so I'm going to be
using the baby doll mascara from YSL I'm
gonna use this on my lashes let's hope
this mascara is as good as I remember it
being
so nice do you see that I still love it
I think this is a liquid lip from Dior I
kind of took off the pr package so I'm
not sure if it's a liquid lip or gloss
I'm gonna use this Laura Mercier powder
fection waterproof eyeliner pencil liner
and this one's in the shade spice I
don't think I said that and I'm gonna go
in with this Dior yeah do your liquid
and six one four jungle
this is matte I like that color I don't
know if I'm obsessed with the formula
okay guys so this is the makeup look
that I did today I liked that I did no
liner or lashes that way I saw baby doll
actually it worked so well for me so I
really like the way this makeup look
turned out that is it for this video you
guys I really hope you enjoyed it I'm
gonna go brush out my hair probably put
it in a ponytail and go around my
errands now thank you guys so much for
