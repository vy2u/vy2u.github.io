to be doing a talk through get ready
with me just gonna be answering some
questions in this video I haven't done
like a proper Q&amp;amp;A a while and I figured
I would do it as I was getting ready to
film some different videos today that is
what this video to point to be on ask
you and Twitter to ask me your questions
and I've got a few to go through so if
you're interested definitely keep
watching and don't forget to subscribe
before you leave and let's just go ahead
and get started all right we're going to
go ahead and put our hair back actually
getting my hair done this week I'm so
excited I put a lot of questions of
people asking me if I'm going to go
brunette before the wedding and that is
a no I really like my hair this color
anyway so I think I want to keep it for
a little while eventually I'll probably
go back dark but we will see it took me
a long time this is color so I'm keeping
it for a while I'm trying to think of
like little life updates a lot of you
see a little bit more my life on my blog
channel so if you haven't checked that
out I will leave it below but Davis this
is the last week that Davis is gone for
a little while really excited so I get
to like see him this weekend and
everything I'm super excited about it
because our last weekend apart for a
while hopefully I am definitely
independent I mean I was by myself in my
house in Georgia for a long time but I'm
still adjusting to moving to a whole new
state when I first moved it didn't hit
me I think like for a while that I
officially moved but it's finally hit me
I realized I am a long way from home and
yeah I'm still adjusting this weekend I
think we're going to do some fun stuff
so I'm really excited to take the dogs
with me seventy at a time Bo let's
answer some of your questions also I'm
going to be using the Nicole Concilio
palette I love this tile I think it's
great so I'm going to also be using this
today first question I see is are you
planning on wearing your hair up or down
for your wedding I am planning on
wearing it down I don't want to do I
mean I might do like a half up half down
I'm not too sure I feel more comfortable
with my hair down so that's what I'm
going to be doing and I'm going to have
updos for the bridesmaids I'm going in
to be Nicole Concilio palette and I'm
going to be taking mixing I'm going to
mix these two shades and I'm going to
throw them into my crease you guys when
I checked out this palette it's so nice
I have a
why hits and misses coming out very very
soon it might be the next video after
this but this is in there because I love
it so much I think it's so good and the
cold is a sweet girl and meeting her
she's the nicest person ever I don't
even know what look I'm going for today
I just knew I wanted something a little
bit warm to kind of go with the shirt a
little bit not too matchy-matchy alright
maybe it will turn out a little pageant
hooky a lot of people are asking will I
be changing at my name on social media
after we have our ceremony and I'm going
to short I don't think I will but I'm
going to be taking a hey girl right now
I don't think I will just because it is
like my brand name you know what I mean
that's just what I go by
Casey Holmes so I probably won't
Angelina asked just asking for a second
opinion should I put my current job that
I hate and start a YouTube channel when
I started getting more views and stuff
and like I was at a job that I hated to
I didn't hate the people I just hated
the line of work that I was doing but I
did not quit right away like without
having any sort of income coming from
YouTube I feel like that's not
necessarily the smartest decision in my
opinion I feel like you should have some
sort of income coming in just so that
you're safe and you have a safety net
you know what I mean but I would
recommend building up your channel
really making sure you can make a living
off of it first and then doing it or
just finding another job that you feel
like will make you feel better and then
just focus a lot more into your YouTube
I mean start a YouTube channel is hard
I've been on here for almost eight years
now and it's a lot of work it's not an
overnight success type of thing I mean
for some people it is and just take your
time and if you really love it
then do it I always tell people don't do
YouTube for the money because it doesn't
necessarily last if you do it that way I
just really go into it for the money
it's not going to satisfy you and
eventually you'll want to give up
because the hate calm I mean you got to
endure a lot of stuff being on the
internet and just putting yourself out
there but it's worth it if you truly
love what you're doing and I'm saying I
would just start your YouTube channel
have it as like you know a hobby for a
little while and work on it to make it
grow and then when you have a
substantial amount to live off of with
YouTube then I would say quit your job
that's like that might be the adult in
me but
I have never like quit a job without any
sort of income ever do you want to keep
your hair short for the wedding or do
you want to grow it out these extensions
I'm growing it out currently right now
it's done quite a bit longer but I will
be using extensions I'll be using my
foxy laughs extensions for some link so
yeah I'm going to have it long for the
wedding I'm really excited about it but
once the wedding is over on chavanel
we're going back shorter and then I'm
going to take a little bit of pizza
throw this in here just to blend it out
also you guys I know I mentioned this
absolutely everywhere but I have to tell
my folks on my main channel if you have
not tried the cauliflower pizza from
Trader Joe's I mentioned it on my
snapchat life-changing life-changing is
so good I have tried call our fried rice
before it was awful
I was a small I would never try anything
else cauliflower again because I think
everywhere that I would like the
healthier option and I was like okay
I'll try it oh I was scarred I was
scarred for months I called hot pizza oh
my gosh it is so good actually show it
on my vlog channel you probably won't
see it because I'm still vlogging like
today and stuff but I will feature it on
there and like I said I showed you all
my snap it is so it's so good okay and
now I'm going to take this from main
line I have been loving these color
tattoo I Crohn's I think they're awesome
okay so this is in the shade bronze
sheen and I'm going to go ahead and
apply this on the inner part of my eye
someone asks are you planning on kids or
any animals so does the house here at
allow more animals we can't have another
animal but they have to be under I think
like 50 pounds at least one of the
animals it has to be under 50 pounds and
Daisy is like 30 so we're good I don't
think we're get any more pet Davis
really does want a baby right now he has
got baby fever I don't think I've ever
met a man who has had as much baby fever
his Davis has right now I'm personally
not quite ready for kissing I think we
need to like have a ceremony enjoy for a
little while someone else I said would I
ever consider having a p.o box and the
answer is no I just don't see myself
wanting to get one because I feel like
it's just going to be a lot to keep up
with I
I also am not very comfortable with
having a peel Box address out there
that's just me personally so the answer
to that is no I apologize guys but just
don't see myself really wanting one
right now Mixon Sagittarius and glorious
things that can be it for the eyes I
think I'm done this is like the most
satisfying part so now we move on the
face and then I'll put lashes on and all
that in a little bit because it takes a
while to do that so I'm going to do it
off camera but we're going to be trying
something different today I'm going to
be trying this first a beauty triple
protection skin tint with goji berry it
has SPF 30 does it say for sensitive
skin and I got two shade medium I think
this is like the choose little packaging
ever I'm thinking the medium shade will
be okay for me because they're just felt
hand I did read some of the reviews and
there was someone with really oily skin
and I said that they loved this so I
have high hopes now so I'm going to take
the primer water and then my Natasha
Genoa anti-shine primer and applied to
use too many and with this birthday
beauty thing it didn't really say like
how to apply it so I'm just going to
apply with a brush I have a more dense
brush I can use and then I was thinking
something like this so we'll see the
best it says to shake well like that I'm
trying to figure out how liquidy this is
it's not that bad it looks like a
regular foundation so that's it's a
little bit runny but not much and I'm
going to go in first with this morphe g4
brush I'm using I'm going to do it on
one side of my face the color is
actually really nice but I did use a
shitload of product just now
maybe this is too flimsy so I also have
this Tarte bamboo brush that came out
with I think it was their clay stick
foundation have this to try as well I'm
not the biggest fan of this brush but
yours could see other one is definitely
giving more coverage more foundation
going
all right um let's just try this pur
cosmetics one this is like in-between
kind of flimsy kind of more stiff we'll
see if this looks good I'm using so much
of this product though
oh no why my neck is so much lighter
from the rest my body and most of you
know I'm either I wear foundation or I
don't
I either like really full coverage or I
just won't wear it at all that's why I
smell do too many like lighter looks
because like in my everyday life I don't
wear makeup all the time at all which is
why I don't do a lot of bite our makeup
looks not because I don't want to but
because usually when I put on makeup I'm
just like alright let's go big let's do
a smokey eye let's do it good and I just
I know I kind of forget about lighter
looks because I want to go full in
because I love dramatic bold look so
when it comes to foundation that's why
I'm normally like full coverage or
nothing at all I'm interested to see how
this will wear throughout the day with
my oily skin I would say it's like
making my skin look perfect should kind
of work it in a little bit more like Pat
it in so I'm going to go ahead and put
that up if you tried this out let me
know how you like to use it I figured I
wouldn't try with the sponge come in and
think it would work well with it because
I thought it was going to be really
liquidy to be honest with you so if you
have tried this with a sponge let me
know in the comments which think you
have any tips or tricks I'm down to here
so next up I'm going to try a new
concealer I'm so excited about this
because it's a Clinique beyond
perfecting a super concealer and it's in
a very Pharos let's do one eye at a time
just see what it was like now I'm kind
of confused why they came out with a
beyond perfecting super concealer
because you know this reminds me of the
beyond perfecting liquid foundation but
that can also be used as concealer as
well I don't know if you guys have tried
that beyond perfecting foundation and
concealer as a concealer but it is
really really nice I don't know if I'm
stressed I have not had the best luck
with trying out new foundations and
concealers lately I don't know what it
is but it's not it's more like a medium
coverage concealers definitely not full
coverage in my opinion because every
time I use full coverage concealers I
really compare it to the torch shaped
April why I haven't been fine
like amazing amazing products lately I
love this little brush for getting right
in the inner corner it's the ACOG medics
airbrush blurring concealer I bought
this a little bit ago from Ulta and it
is so good I love it so I'm not a
specialist face makeup I'm going to go
ahead and take it off because it's just
not working for me it's just breaking up
here the redness is peeking through
which throws everything off and I'm not
obsessed to the concealer so I'm just
going to take it all okay so I'm going
to go ahead and apply my foundation like
my regular foundation and concealer and
then I'll be back to show you guys the
products that I use in my basement so
have the taught know that support I have
the hourglass bandaged foundation on I
have the Tarte shape tape concealer on
Lennox's whele I also have the main
length of me concealer on and I did
throw on a Selma terracotta bronzer now
I am going to go into this pur cosmetics
contour Diaries I really like this I
like this shade right here so I'm going
to use that with this beet cosmetics
brush so instead how do you like base
living and have you made some close
friends is definitely a little bit
different I'm always paranoid that I
forgot my idea or something to be honest
with you okay and I haven't I mean I've
made some friends but I haven't really
hung out with too many people just
because I have been traveling so much
since we moved here you know I have at
the time to really hang out with a bunch
of different people I mean has gone to
like brunch and I've hung out with a
couple people in the weekend but for the
most part I've just been keeping to
myself we first moved here I was
unpacking like a madwoman and Davis was
here as well so we were just kind of
getting the house situated and then once
he left I started traveling more and
yeah I just haven't had the chance to
really meet a ton of people I have met
some really nice ladies so far I like it
I'm still adjusting like I mentioned
before going on a honeymoon if so to
where I don't think we're going to go on
a honeymoon by the way real quick I'm
using this number 7 peachy velvet blush
I don't know if we're going to go on a
honeymoon right after the wedding I
think at some point we will but we
haven't really planned it because I
don't think we'll be able to just do
certain things but honestly it's like
not that big of a deal to us
because we're also going on a really big
trip in at the end of August that we're
so excited about and we kind of call
that our pre honeymoon even though it's
really not it's just going to be so much
fun so hopefully after the ceremony
we'll find some time to go on a
honeymoon and I'm not too sure where we
want to go I mean I would love to go to
Bora Bora guys were realistic about it
like will we actually be able to go with
Davis's work and everything any tips I
learned while wedding planning I don't
think I have any tips but I will say I'm
so glad I got a planner answering back
to her stuff is hard enough I couldn't
imagine doing on my own and she's like a
full-service planner that's good for me
because I don't have to like interact
too much with all of the companies and
everything I don't have to do all the
negotiating but she does so that's
really really nice it's going to be
really fun though I'm very excited about
it so I can't wait for you guys to see
everything some of the people that watch
me I know don't like me and don't
deserve to see the wedding but I'm doing
it literally just for the people out
there who love me because I know there's
a lot of you out there who love and
support I thought long and hard about
like do I actually want to post the
video online like do I want to do that
because you know people just have
nothing better to do and that's kind of
how I felt with wedding planning as well
like do I still actually want to vlog it
like do I want to show people this
process because some people are just
nasty there's more supportive people
than there are negative so y'all are the
reason we're going to show the video and
all of that because kind of like you
guys are invited to the wedding my gosh
somebody asked to do a what's in my bag
and I have thought about that video so
much like doing it for my blog channel
cuz I missed those videos I missed like
old school YouTube when the was
just so easy and fun like I missed those
days of just uploading whatever you
wanted and people watched it like now
you have to actually you know come up
with content that's like creative or
else people aren't going to watch it all
of the other stuff that I'm just like
man what's a nice bag videos are
honestly so fun because I love seeing
what's another people's bags and because
I don't know I'm not that nosy of a
person but it just fascinates me how
some people organize their bag and like
what certain things that they keep but
it makes me one of the nicer things so I
personally love them are you still
planning on creating your own t-shirts
for us to buy
I've mentioned this a while back that I
really wanted to do merch or something I
think the whole process I still do want
to do it it's just figuring out how to
get started the same with the freaking
dog line the dog lines like the hardest
thing to try to come up with I mean I
also want to own my own like online
clothing boutiques I live in Georgia
right now I would probably be pursuing
that online boutiques just because I
would be at home I could purchase a
warehouse it would be a permanent
location but since Davis is in the
military you know we have to move and
stuff and I can't commit to one area and
have three things that I want to do come
out with t-shirts come out with a dog
line and then also an online boutique
like I have so many ideas for them but I
think just I'm trying to figure out how
to make it work with like where I'm
living with moving and if it turned into
something big but I have some will work
for me just like a lot in one that I I'm
trying to figure out the glue is still
drying on these lashes but I did use the
lily it latches ghalichi clam in caviar
and I really like them they're like
completely wispy from end to end and I
really like it
someone asked what was like a different
tradition that we're going to do at a
wedding and somebody has going to be a
little bit different at our wedding is
actually the cake and I'm not going to
go into too much detail now but it is
going to be different so I'm going to be
like you're a traditional white wedding
cake but I'm really excited to see it
and we're not doing a cake tasting or
anything because Davis likes vanilla I
like chocolate I mean if you mess that
up we have an issue yeah we're doing
like a different design for our wedding
cake and it's something that is more
sentimental so we are very excited about
it
know why why oh my gosh Carly says dry
now once the whittier fitness workout
tips I just started my signature tea and
look at machines like is it dead so for
my first started working out it was
definitely a little bit harder now like
I started working out like in 2013
that's been there wasn't like a lot of
instagramers or anything like that where
you could really learn it was just kind
of like look at the directions on
machine or ask someone but no I mean
there's so many different video
and just ways to learn especially on
YouTube that's what I do I like to do my
Instagram page and like save different
videos and then right before I go to the
gym I watch them sometimes I'll watch
them inside the gym and I get my ideas
from there some days are better than
others just test out different things
and I'm telling you if you look I feel
like watching people on Instagram makes
me more motivated because you also get
to see their techniques and like how
they do certain things and how they grow
the booty and it's like your own
personal trainer but without personal
trainer I used to always have personal
trainers especially for the last like
three years I have personal trainers but
moving up here I was like okay I'm
totally going to get one because I hate
going to new gyms and not knowing where
everything is and I actually find out
but it took them forever to ever get
back to me like I think someone
contacted me a week ago and I was like
man I don't want to but eventually I
just went to the gym and like started
learning where everything was and where
I wanted to work out it just takes time
it really does it just takes time it's
definitely a learning process you have
so many videos and tools at your
fingertips that are free so use them to
your advantage I think once you start
learning different techniques and what
the different machines actually do then
you start getting more motivated and
like I said there's so many videos on
Instagram you to check out with me
Simmons Nicki black hitter I've had a
couple of questions asking what Alex and
Ani bracelets I owned they were all
gifts I have like an army Warren and
Auburn won and then I forget what the
last ones called through and last ones
called but they were all gifts and I
love them I love wearing them I get this
question a lot someone like my wedding
planner also asked me who the designer
was for my dress to my wedding dress I
have no idea I'm doctor like I didn't
know anything about wedding dresses I
didn't know who made them I didn't know
I mean I knew Vera Wang actually Vera
Wang is something someone that everyone
knows that my dress is not bare away but
I didn't really pay attention to who
it's by a press I questioned quite a few
times and I feel like it's the proper
answer to know who your wedding dress is
five I'm just like this is a really good
question because I remember this
specifically and I said were you nervous
to go makeup free around David for the
first time love you and when David might
first started dating so we met the first
night and then he left for year at the
next day left for a life what was it a
month
and basically all our dates like we're
FaceTime and I remember specifically the
first FaceTime call that he did I first
thought I never use FaceTime before
meeting Davis ever and he was like
slipspace time nobody would know we
ended up starting to FaceTime more but
then there was one evening where I
didn't have makeup on and my hair wasn't
done and I was like oh god I'm so
nervous I hope you watch some of my
videos
it was so nerve-racking but like once I
got on it was so easy and I don't even
know why I was nervous with him because
I felt comfortable everything else and
like I literally did that for a living
like I'm on camera without makeup but I
was so nervous I was so nervous but I
think - because FaceTime was also new to
me and we I mean think I was not a new
thing it was just I never used it but I
was like I don't know how I feel because
I just look at myself and I was way I
look but you know now he sees it all the
time what I'm using right now is the new
bite Beauty this is their liquefied lip
and lip just so nice to wear yesterday
and I loved it so this is the makeup
look guys I hope you enjoyed it I think
it turned out really pretty I like it a
lot and level good is Ramon guy but I
think I love it a little bit more
because this shirt that kind of like
just go together but thank you so much
for watching I really hope you guys
enjoyed this don't forget to subscribe
but before you leave and I will see you
all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
