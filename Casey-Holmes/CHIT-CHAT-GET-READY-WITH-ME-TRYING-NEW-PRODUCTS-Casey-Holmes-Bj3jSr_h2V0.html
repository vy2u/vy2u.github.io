it has been so long since I saw you guys
I know a lot of you were probably like
where have you been
wouldn't even doing I have just been so
busy the past couple weeks
and I did have some videos free filmed I
did upload a couple while I was gone but
then the last one that I had I just
wasn't the biggest and out I didn't
really enjoy it and everybody had
already posted videos about it it was on
Koki cosmetics I was missing my
foundation and I was like you know I'm
not I'm not understand happy with it I
don't want to upload things I'm not 100%
happy with I just didn't upload that
video so I'm sorry that there hasn't
been any and almost two weeks which is
crazy I don't think I've ever taken like
a two-week break from YouTube but if you
can follow me on my blog channel and
you've kind of been with me throughout
the weeks I have been posting on there
so if you're not subscribed be sure to
subscribe to that channel and also this
one all that stuff will be linked down
below and to come on here I asked you
guys if you want to get ready with me
chitchat or a weird test on this
foundation and a lot of you wanted a get
ready with me so that's I'm going to do
it for you today and I'm just going to
tell you what I think about this
foundation and all that kind of stuff
and you kind of catch you up on life
very excited to be back I have been
missing filming like crazy I hope you
don't mind the setup right now it's not
completely permanent I think the
lighting is better in here just because
there's white walls so back here it's
not permanent just yet I haven't really
adjusted aligning too much split we're
working with so I hope you guys like it
and I will be doing a beauty room tour
on my blog channel when I have it all
figured out which is I'm pretty close to
being done I just have a few more things
to do and I'll definitely be like more
of a casual video nothing to structure
just showing you guys what I did to
downsize with storage ideas we did and
just different things like that we're
just going to go ahead and hop on in and
also in this video I'm going to be
trying out a bunch of different products
for you so I have some new things that
I'm loving and then we're trying out
lots of new makeup as well because I
have been dying to try new makeup I
haven't really experimented with a lot
of new things other than like this
foundation let's just go ahead and get
started
okay so let's drop with eyes the first
thing I'm going to do is prime my eyes
with this Smashbox photo-finish lid
primer in the shade light I still really
enjoy the stuff I love how it just
covers up any darkness and
brightens up the lid and creates an even
canvas so a lot of you who are following
me knew that I wanted me to touch the
non sunset palette for the longest time
it's like every time I came back in
stock it was I was talk in a second and
I could not get my hands on it but you
guys hooked it up you let me know when
they were back in stock like I think the
last time and I was able to grab it so
shout out to all of you who tweeted me
tag me in all the photos sent me
Instagram DM I mean you guys were
awesome so that is what we using today
Signet oestrogen ona sunset palette and
I thought this was bigger this was
definitely smaller than the other
palettes that I have from her and it's
still pretty pricey because I'm
expensive as the other ones so this is
what looks like I'm sure you guys have
seen this so many times and then I mean
honestly I knew I had to have this
palette I mean it's just stunning so I'm
going to go in with this brush from NARS
this is just something that came in all
shades ed my forehead just something
that came in in PR oh there's not like a
cream shade there's like this light pink
shape I don't want to put that all over
my lid so I'm just going to go in with
some translucent powder this is a clay
to PO powder you know it's really
expensive but you can use any powder
that you want just a translucent powder
I'm just going to set my lid and set
that primer just so it doesn't move and
nothing creases I have miss you guys so
much
and if you follow my blog channel a lot
of you do I was kind of taking a break
and it's just something that I really
needed a we were moving B there were
some stuff going on here on YouTube that
I was like who knows not worth it you
know whatever you take the time to like
enjoy our moment and just like get the
house together and just do things for us
so that's why I took some time off if
you're wondering and I was planning on
filming it this week but I went to HSN
so if you saw me on HSN thank you so
much I had a lot of cheats and stuff
about me being on there so I really
appreciate it I'm going to take this
color right here which is horizon and
put this in my crease so yeah I needed
some time off thank you guys for letting
me have time off being okay with it I've
gotten so many tweets saying that you
missed the videos especially Beauty
videos and trust me as much filming them
because I love makeup videos but I just
need some time off and
guys understand sometimes you just need
to take a moment to step back and do
what's best for you and that was
definitely what was best for me I didn't
want to come on camera and have my vibes
be off does that makes any sense
I feel so much better now I'm ready to
crank out videos we're going to get back
to three days a week which is Tuesdays
Thursdays and Sundays I'm also going to
try to upload in the morning time that's
what we're going to do so if you're new
those are my uploading schedules vlog
should go of whatever they like I let
you don't want snapchat and my Twitter
and stuff when they go up I'm going to
take this really pretty shade right here
with a blending brush this palette is
just everything to me I love it so much
and I'm going to put this in the outer
half oh my god so pretty I think theirs
and I are going to go on a little date
because I just got back we ate sushi
last night I think we're going to go out
again tonight somewhere I feel like you
guys you might just so amazing like the
support you would show me throughout
past couple weeks has just been
incredible and I really cannot thank you
enough that's exactly what made me want
to come back in full swing and get your
get things done for you because I missed
it and I really do a little Minich
everybody do feel like you guys are my
friends that I've just been you know I'm
packing and unpacking the village and
we've been missing a couple things like
I can't find I couldn't find my HDMI
cable to suck the camera up to my TV for
the longest time and then I finally
found it thank God but then I couldn't
find camera battery so I had to go on
Amazon or two batteries and a charger
like to charge the batteries we had the
army pack our stuff for us and we're
just you know we're not some of your
things but I think they're in boxes that
we just don't know where they are you
know like a miscellaneous boxes probably
I'm going to take this pencil brush
again from NARS we have like the longest
handles ever and I'm going to go in with
this color right here and we use this in
the outer V right here a little bit I'm
just going to deepen this up make it
nice and smoky and
and for those asking I'm really enjoying
where I'm at right now it's still pretty
cold like in 60s which everyone's saying
around here that that's not normal like
it should be like mid 70s or like in the
70s right now and it's not definitely
different to then Georgia but I'm still
really enjoying it I mean we have a
super target I've never had a super
target before you guys ever I've never
experienced that in my life like having
produce at Target and I love it I don't
ever want to go to a different target
you know I'm saying so all you have to
do is give me a target at Dunkin Donuts
Starbucks and ammos they have a Lowe's I
mean I'm fine with that you know I don't
need a lot in my coffee basics and
member Ito basic you know you guys to
let me know what kind of videos you want
to see from me of course I've kind of
been off my game you I don't know what
is really out there right now so let me
know what you guys are loving I still
have some Instagram products I need to
try out for you I have those waiting I'm
actually I got the Instagram brawl okay
and David told me last night he was like
have you seen like what has happened to
some girls that brawl and he showed me
the doctor's page where she shows like
some of her patients and all that and
one of the patients with the girls that
was like wearing one of those Instagram
brawl and she had a really bad rash on
her boob and it was like scary like
something with the glue was just too
harsh for her skin and they say it's
been happening a lot to a lot of girls
so I'm a little terrified to try that
out to be honest with you because I have
heard it is very very sticky like I
don't want a rash you don't say it's
just not worth it I love my little
sticky brawl from belt which a lot of
you ask me in my clothing hall where I
got that sticky bra from is from Belk
but I might do instagramming me by a lot
like successful to the beauty you know
things that people talk about a lot I
had a lot of questions on what eyeshadow
I was wearing on my HSN segments and it
was B Natasha de Nona number the
eyeshadow palette v number 13 so this is
where I wore and then I also wore my
Smashbox pearl palette on these in the
second line segment base those
eyeshadows just to brighten it up and
also show that you can use my palettes
as eyeshadows as well
Natasha Genoa you guys is so expensive
but I promise you I would never
recognize something this expensive
good her eye shows are just phenomenal
they've always been phenomenal and I've
never had a problem with them and I like
when I use her eyeshadows I enjoy
putting on eye shadow you know what I
mean kit I know it's going to look good
I'm not going to blend out well let me
know what you guys think about the
lighting like I feel like in the TV
right now it does look really good but I
want to hear you feedback so I'm going
to use the Too Faced glitter glue so I'm
going to put this in the center right
here that goes too far but take it up to
the crease you get all the way that
crease and then I'm going to use I think
this shape is calling my name so I'm
going to use this one first I love her
shimmer shades and do the same for the
other eye I just knew this towel is
gonna be my shed like take this little
fluffy brush again from NARS and I'm
going to pick this shade and just to
lend out the edges of that now the thing
about the glitter glue I mentioned it
before but it's kind of hard to blend
other shadows on top so you just gotta
really work with it Ellen looks better I
should have just gone in with the
blending brush and just did the edges
instead of adding more color okay when
take just a little bit more of this
shade go right in the crease just so we
don't lose that really pretty color
so kind of literally like a sunset okay
you're spilling it like that because if
I keep messing with it I'm gonna ruin it
I'm going to go ahead and move on the
face makeup and we'll finish up all of
this with lashes and stuff afterwards so
I'm going to use the primer water which
I just sprayed and now I'm going to use
this chart poreless mattifying primer a
lot of you've been asking me how I feel
about this I've had sitting in my drawer
in boxes and then indoors since before I
move so very excited to share it with
you guys this is what the packaging
looks like very pretty and we're just
going to test this out and see this good
paint often because you guys know I love
the camera often primers not always the
biggest fan of primers that live like
this like that silicone look texture but
we will see definitely still pore
filling does it feel like a sticky mat
definitely feels like just
at home primarily they said normally out
like these kind of primary but we will
see how it work so I'm going to use this
foundation say I have to reshape the new
covergirl vitalist healthy elixir
foundation and at first it didn't seem
doesn't like this because a pretty sure
I saw a couple review saying like you're
super doing and they loved it and I was
like no but I loved the coverage of it
and I wanted to give it a shot so I've
been using it and I love this foundation
this is why I wore on HSN I feel like it
looks beautiful on camera it looks
beautiful in photography it just looks
so good on the skin and honestly I'm
oily but it hasn't made me more oily all
you have to do is take a blotting sheet
and take the oils like your skin it is
nothing like super crazy and it doesn't
look like a drugstore foundation this is
one of my new favorite foundations I had
to just go and purchase this one today
because they had I had to shade 745
instead of 25 but they didn't have this
one which is 732 so I'm actually going
to use 732 today because I'm in between
these two shades I personally like it
both ways I let your with a brush and I
also like it was a sponge one of the
things that I have found is that my
brush will leave streaks on my face so I
need to go in with like a sponge just to
touch it up the shade is a nude beige
sea 732 and I get mine from the PX in
this $9.99 I don't know if it's
different in other places they've also
been loving another foundation that's
high-end and I did not think I was going
to like this foundation but I love it
it's a Natasha Genoa foundation x full
coverage foundation this would probably
match me now this is a 42 medium this is
really great too has really great
coverage with optimal skin now the brush
I like to use with it is it cosmetics
heavenly love brush just really like the
bristles of this I got was in the pr
package and i have been loving it with
this foundation so i'm just going to
show you guys the coverage really quick
on one side my face yeah this is a good
match for me right now I mean look at
this it just looks like skin it's so
beautiful but it's full coverage I
really like it a lot I was so blown away
by the foundation I even wore it out to
a barbecue all day last weekend we have
like a neighborhood barbecue which was
so fun and they wore this and I
it lasted so well there's another
high-end foundation I used last week
that I've been trying you know using it
back and forth and I don't like it at
all it does not last well on my skin and
let me tell you it breaks up so bad what
is the foundation I'm talking about as
discipline is the girl on lingerie Depot
natural perfection foundation this looks
great for the first few hours and like I
love the look of it but oh my gosh it
does not last it probably lasts for like
six hours looking good but then it
starts breaking up like crazy and you
honestly cannot save it it just looks
awful drugstore foundations aware that
this form by covergirl the white wall
photo finish one is also incredible if
you're not a drugstore kind of girl I
would recommend just checking you out
because they have completely crazy stuff
right now
I love drugstore you guys know that oh I
also showed you guys on my snapchat my
favorite skincare right now concur I've
been absolutely loving great makeup
starts with great skincare know you guys
know that that Lord I my skin was so bad
when we made the drive up I guess
because the weather change and just like
not having a little bit skincare
regiment on the way up because I had
actually left a lot of my skincare I was
family friends house and however for
like a week like all my serums and stuff
like that so I was just using what I had
and it's the biggest difference when I
got back on my regimen with these
product sounds like yeah like this my
skin is so like balanced now I mean I'm
still pretty oily not as bad as I used
to be and I used to have really bad dry
patches and I don't really have that
anymore oh I will be most products down
below if you guys want me to do a video
let me know I was seeing and including
it and like next more favorites because
I don't have a lot of favorites this
month so let me know if you guys would
see a different video but that's what I
was kind of going for I'm paying my
regular concealers Tarte shake tape and
then the Maybelline fit me okay and then
the Maybelline fit me this is a really
great concealer
since use Tarte went in here here this
is darkness and then I like to use the
Maybelline fit me to highlight some more
and then I'll just take that same
L'Oreal sponge and blend everything else
this is a really great combo all of
these products and if you don't have the
Tarte shape tape you could just use a
Maybelline one and it looks so good
louisa foundation have a new training
product coming because obviously when I
was at HSN I was like watching
there's segments and the pan luck stuff
was on oh my gosh this girl's like so
dark so I actually ordered the body
stuff but I use their face gainer and it
was so nice because all you have to do
is mix it with your moisturizer but
literally HSN will do that to you like
you sit there and there's like well that
looks cool and then somehow you just end
up ordering everything oh I'm not going
to bake I'm just going to go ahead and
set my face with the clay to PO powder
I've been really enjoying this powder I
think it is beautiful I haven't used up
the flash photography yet so I don't
know if this great will flash but I just
don't know something about this powder I
love it just really makes your skin look
nice and smooth
another feature this on the video yet
guys is so nice because she like that
filtered effect I will say I have the
biggest fan of baking with it like I
mean I'll do it if I need my makeup
class like for real all freaking day but
I think just setting the face looks
beautiful sometimes I feel like it can
look a little too powdery if I bake with
it just because you guys know I love to
do heavy baking and like make it look
really intense but I do love setting my
makeup with it can't say I would
repurchase it but I'm definitely going
to use it all up you know I really do
like it but I feel like I could use some
other ones for a cheaper price I'm going
to use this bronzer that I got in PR
that I'm dying to try because every body
has been talking about it and saying
it's like the best color ever it is it's
a Marc Jacobs 104 Fantastico mega
bronzer so this is their newest bronzer
right here supposedly the colors just
sinning so we're gonna see today I'm
going to use a shine you Kashuk brush
where is it this one I got a cute little
set from Sonia Kashuk to that I'm really
enjoying I think it's really pretty it
is a nice warm tan shade to meet oh my
god you know it reminds me of the smell
and the color reminds me of the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer that I
love I should have done one half of my
face with that and other half with this
one see the difference but I really do
like this color this is a very natural
tan bronzer I like it
that's the bronzer is really pretty very
smooth does it look like I'm wearing
bronzer looks nice and tan smells really
good but it smells like the butter
bronzer from Physicians Formula if
you're wondering
so now I'm going to use this Urban Decay
Naked skin contour palette I'm not going
to use the creams in here in just Musa
powders I'm not a big cream person when
it comes to contouring and highlighting
all of that I mean I'll highlight with
my concealer but you know using
something like this to highlight I don't
normally do that I'm just going to use
the powder is this what it looks like
and the powders are on this side and
then you have the creams on this side
which I like the two separate
compartments I think that's great so I'm
going to go in with this one right here
and contour my space so I'll draw with
this little NARS brush and this might be
able to stick we don't find out today
there's just a little duo fiber brush so
we'll see need to wash my brushes really
bad this is actually really nice nice
little shadow color I don't know if it's
blending as well as I sought it with but
it looks I mean look at that cheekbone
cut and I'm going to go in with a blush
just the essence satin touch blush so it
looks like it's very very pretty very
pretty colors just like a little wash
call it kind of like this brush for
blush I didn't think I would but now I'm
going to go in with this Becca Chrissy
Teigen a collab and I want to why my
palette had all the little paper stick
to it but just stuck to it I don't know
packaging is really pretty mine is that
though I think it's really gorgeous and
then on the inside it's got a really big
mirror and then these shades the bronzer
and blush have a lot of shimmer in it so
I didn't really want to use those today
because I don't want a shimmery bronzer
on my face so I'm just going to use I'm
going to mix these two colors right here
apply them to my cheeks
it is really pretty but do you like it I
would say like I'm obsessed
that's that palette if you are wondering
all I meant to uses its a velvet Iser
from Urban Decay dang it
and then to use that cuz I did I music
and let's just put this little
highlighter on top this is a wet and
wild highlighter that's new it's called
bronze over the rainbow and it's limited
edition it looks really pretty to be
honest of you I don't see the difference
but it's really pretty oh oh there it is
okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to do my brows I'm going to use my
makeup revolution brow pomade I love it
I'm almost hitting pan on it actually
and I'm going to do my winged liner and
lashes and then I will be back to finish
up this video for you guys okay guys so
I'm back my lashes on my liner my brows
we're good the lashes that I have on our
Lily lashes these are just literally
lashes that I have on I love Lily lashes
I've recently like been really enjoying
them I just think they're so fluttery
and beautiful anyways now we're going to
move on and finish up this look and wrap
up this video so now I'm going to do is
I'm going to go back into the unit Asha
Johanna palette also if you see my glue
is drying from my lashes so don't mind
that I'm going to take this shade right
here in the palette I'm going to
highlight my brow with this once it is
right underneath the brow and now we're
going to do is take this makeup geek
full spectrum eyeliner pencil in the
shade plumber iya and put this on our
waterline I'm going to take this smaller
brush and I'm going to use that really
deep shade that we used earlier and
press this up against that lower lash
line I can't find my small flat brushes
so we're just going to use this for now
I would prefer to you to Sigma I think
it's like a 35 but I can't find it right
now okay and now I'm going to go in with
a mixture of this one and the shimmery
shade we put on earlier this is the
inner corner and now I'm going to do is
take my benefit roller lash and then
just going to put this on my lower
lashes I'm just going to take this by
beauty lip pencil in number 22 and kind
of fill in my lips as well
has a base descent on you don't have to
because it's so pigmented but I just
like to do it and again I'm going to use
a champagne pearl great so good I mean
it's just so pretty normally I don't
like glasses like this but there's
something about this one that I'd and
love successes and talked over like
really pretty matte colors like in the
center oh my god okay guys so that is
infinite video I hope you enjoyed it

myself together and like change I hope
