to be doing another to chat answering
your questions get ready with me a lot
of you really enjoyed my last one so I
was like you know what I got to get
ready today so I'm going to film another
one for you guys I asked you guys to ask
me a questions on Twitter and on
snapchat and I'm just going to go off of
those I do have my extensions and today
so when the extensions are in you know
it's going to be a full glam kind of day
we're going to do something a little bit
of fun hopefully I don't know we'll say
so yes if you guys want to get ready
with me then definitely keep watching
and don't forget to subscribe before you
leave and insert slide now we're going
to go ahead and get started
alright so I've already primed my eyes
and today I'm going to using new Sephora
Pro palettes I really wanted to double
into the electric palette so I'm going
to they would often come up with with
that today planning on wearing something
green today for my photos so yeah I
don't I don't know what look I'm going
to do we're just going to wing it since
we're doing a Super Bowl glam look I'm
going to add some tape because it's just
easy I like it you know you don't have
to ask if you don't want to so going
into the warm palette and I'm going to
take this shade right here and just set
my eye I don't know if you guys can tell
but hopefully you can't hear the
clicking as much anymore with the
autofocusing I got a new mic and a whole
new little setup so the mics away from
the camera normally if you hear clicking
in people's videos it's because we have
mics that can mount on top of the camera
and since the mic is over the lens when
auto focus is you can hear it sometimes
the big pain in the ass I mean it's you
know it's just trial and error with
filming stuff but I suddenly got a
different little setup and I'm hoping
you guys can't hear it as much because
it bugs me just as much as the bug view
really excited about that I'm going to
take a transition shade from the palette
I'm just going to use this one right
here and I'm going to throw that into my
crease the first question I have is
something I can't really talk too much
about but someone asked if I had any new
collabs in the work someone else said
what is your go-to everyday foundation I
have been really loving the YSL all
hours foundation I did a full review on
it
and I am still in love with it all right
let's go into the electric palette what
shade do I want to take first actually
so the next shade that I'm going to take
is this little orange guy right here I'm
going to throw that into my crease a
little bit below the first transition
shade I'm going to ask if I'm going to
continue to vlog when Davis and I have
kids and we definitely will be I'm still
like I love logging I think vlogging is
fun I love editing vlogging footage I
just I don't know I really enjoy blogs
it's just so hard for me sometimes to
balance everything between snapchat
Instagram I've talked about this before
but it's just a lot to like keep you
guys updated on so I try my best to vlog
as much as I can but like recently it
hasn't been too too much because I've
been busy and I have pre filming because
of why I have talent to make sure I have
videos for you guys but I feel like when
life kind of calms down and like the
wedding's over and all of that I
definitely think I'll be vlogging more
next I'm going to go in with this orange
shade and I don't quite know where I'm
putting this but we're just going to
wing it I'm putting on the outer V into
the crease as well just for a little bit
more of an intense orange but though I
love orange eyeshadows you guys know if
you've watched me for a really long time
orange eyeshadows are just why is my
camera not focusing I'm about to beat
you now I've been I don't know which
shade I want to use okay I'm going to go
into the green it's probably a bad idea
but I'm going to this right in here
what's been your biggest challenge so
far wedding planning we're getting
married around the same time and it's so
hectic I mean I think the whole wedding
planning process like I'm glad I'm not a
planner let's just say that I enjoy
wedding planning but I'm ready for it to
be over because I'm kind of over it I
think the hardest part is like figuring
out like invitations how to were things
because you know obviously this wedding
is going to be like mostly for a closer
friends and family and like need to know
people's names
it's very important to RSVP all these
are suited to your winnings any wedding
that you ever go to
it's just RSVP because it really helps
out a lot a money-wise but also like for
me I meet people things I need to know
who's coming you know I have a wedding
planner for a reason she does most of
the work I just approve or say what I
don't like and all those other stuff so
it's not too bad but it's definitely a
tactic I feel like September is going to
be one of those months or I'm like I'm
tired wedding planning first thing I'm
looking forward to is our vacation at
the end of the month we're actually
going on a fun trip that we are so
excited about feel like everybody else
has been on one of these trips I just
I've always declined people ask me all
the time I don't go on brand trips
sometimes it's just not in the car to me
Andrea I love being home but this time
we're getting to go and I'm so excited
because Davis is going with me and that
is just so exciting to me so I just
added this like mustard yellow in from
the warm palette now I'm going to kind
of diffuse it a little bit it's a very
fall I look I hope you guys don't think
these are too crazy of colors because I
mean they are kind of different for me
but I kind of like it I think it was
cool lacked something a different fall
like you guys know once the ball comes
around you ain't gonna see any light
makeup looks for me going be super glam
or I'll have a super light love with
like a red lip or a really deep lip I
feel like last year I didn't really wear
enough super deep like burgundy almost
black lips but this year we're going in
the Sun I'm ready for it I'm ready for
fall always wanted to be in an area in
fall where like the leaves change colors
a ton I love seeing people like
instagrams like fashion instagrams when
they live more up north because once the
leaves start changing and they go
outside and they have like their cozy
sweaters on it's like their Instagram is
everything I expect fall to be but like
Georgia during the fall you don't really
get it sometimes so I'm just really
excited about that take a break from our
eyes in move on to face because I love
face
actually I need to see if I have a
liquid liner in brown
I'm feeling like I have a lizard liner
in Brown and I really want to use Brown
in my eyes and not black so I don't have
a brown liner but I have these Makeup
Forever aqua XL products should have
freaking use this I forget you through
my drawers but I use actually I'm just
going to go ahead and apply liner so I'm
going to use this Makeup Forever aqua XL
m60 you just look looks like a nice
Brown I've never used this before so
this could go really well or just like a
horrible Brown looks super cool though
kinda like goes with the Cree I like it
took me forever and the lines like not
perfect but I'm feeling that brown liner
it really goes with the look perfectly
it's like a nice warm toned Brown oh so
I'm going to prime getting my regular
primers because I need my trusty ones
for today since we're going outside and
taking photos so I'm going to using the
hourglass vanish stick foundation just
because it matches my self tan really
well right now are just self tan before
I started filming when you and Davis
fight what is it usually about ah we
don't really like ever fight fight I
mean obviously we get argument that we
get on each other's nerves sometimes I
don't think we don't really get in full
blown out arguments um he likes to leave
his stuff out everywhere so sometimes
I'm just like move your stuff I'm a
messy person too so it's kind of like I
don't know I'm I just clean the house
and then he comes in and like put this
stuff ever I'm just like can you please
move please very understanding you know
if I like ask him you know to move this
stuff because I just cleaned he will
it's not like a big ordeal which is why
we don't like fight fight about it yeah
I would say that I still really like
this foundation I've had something to
ask me if I would use this for my
wedding no only because it doesn't keep
me matte for a really long time I need
to be like met/met max on my wedding not
super matte you know like dry matte but
I need it to stay that way for the whole
time right now I'm just in between I
mean I still use Estee Lauder I actually
ordered another
water bottle because a lot of you are
telling me that they don't have SPF
anymore but it's because they have a new
formula now so I ordered a new bottle of
it just to see if I get any flashback
because that's the only issue I have
with a lot of work is my flashback but I
also want to see what it would look like
the wide self Foundation mixed with sa
water the why it sells great by itself
just because it doesn't look that heavy
on the skin estee lauder can look heavy
if you're not careful and I'm a crazy
girl I love full coverage so I'd be like
all over my face this is such a
beautiful foundation I really enjoy it
and that's just my arms and everything
but for some reason my chest is coming
off so light on camera like my neck in
my chest this hair I have like a full
set of foxy locks in like every single
Wes I came in is in my hair so I'm
feeling in a extra it's all said best
tips on saving money / budgeting now let
me tell you when I lived in my apartment
days I did not give a about
budgeting I didn't care about saving
money I didn't care about any of that
all that girl I'm gonna do whatever I
want so I feel like we all go through
that phase though or were like I'm gonna
do this I'm some money even know I
should spend money so I will say even
though I did decide to spend more money
than I do now I was never like broke or
anything I always had money to do stuff
I always had money for rent you know I
didn't like make my bank account
completely try or anything because I
feel like this is not responsible I
would spend my money like buy things I
really didn't need or want or you know I
just bought a lot of stuff about my
shoes you guys saw my shoe all probably
I mean I saw the shitload of shoes but
not as much as I used to
you know donated a lot I have sold a lot
as well like once I bought my house so
in Georgia I think my mindset just kind
of changed I was like wow I mean I saved
up obviously enough money while in the
apartment to buy a house I had a down
payment and all that I mean even though
I spent a little bit more I still had
money to save but I think it's really
just focusing on what you want my cat if
you have a mindset like I knew I wanted
a house and within a few months I had a
house it's all about thinking you can do
something and executing it you know what
I'm saying like keep telling yourself
you can do it and do it and eventually
you will do it I'm telling you the house
that I bought I know this is like
on off topic but the help set I bought
in Georgia you guys I literally went out
I'm such a if I see it I want it I get
it
type of person sometimes that's good
sometimes it's not but what the house
that I bought it was my first day
looking at homes I think we looked at
three or four before we went to that
house which was the final house for the
day I saw it and I fell in love with it
I fell in love with the bonus room I
fell in love with the backyard
and I just had this vision of what I
wanted that house to be and it was such
a great first home such a great first
home for me I loved it I mean if you
guys watched my vlogs you saw that I put
in the porch and everything and I really
miss that home but like I still have it
I'm running out I think what works for
me is knowing I wanted to buy something
really big and something monumental in
my life I had to buckle down and quit
being a crazy little girl and go on
shopping every weekend you know what I'm
saying like you don't need the next
purse that sell or like the next best
thing I mean I bought a Chanel boy bag
and I never freaking wore you know I'm
saying so I had to sell that but when
you sell it sometimes you don't get as
much money as you paid for you know just
don't feel like you have to keep up with
everything
save your money even if it's just a few
dollars a month I mean it all piled up
and used to I don't I still have a
change jar now but I don't really use
cash as much as I used to but I used to
use cash a lot and any kind of any
dollars or five I would put into the
change jar as well as like loose change
and I would just keep there and I would
not touch it and I saved up like I think
two or three hundred dollars with that
door so just save anything you can I
mean even if you do five dollars a month
into a different savings account or
something like that just be sure to not
touch it and be strict on yourself where
would your ideal place to settle work
where I can't help it where would be
your ideal place to settle down and live
definitely in my style we were talking
about this a while ago you know there's
no telling when we'll be able to buy a
house to settle down don't know how long
David's going to be in the army all this
other stuff you definitely want to
settle down within like either the
Carolinas Tennessee Georgia I don't
necessarily want to move to Alabama or
like Florida but
you know kind of like upper southern
parts like the Carolinas Tennessee
Georgia I would love to go back to
Georgia I will taste so and again to
with the budgeting and saving like you
know Davis and I we want to build a
house we whenever we get out of the army
whenever that may be
we want to lake house we want to build
it you know we want it to be like our
dream home so we're saving money for
stuff like that even though that's way
down the line if you start sooner
somewhere out coming and happy no no me
any advice for someone who wants to
start a YouTube that has to shuffle it
between schoolwork and friends just know
we all started there I used to work at a
bank at the same time I was filming
videos as well as another job that I was
doing and it's all about making time for
it even if it's just one video a week
you just gotta set some time for it I
mean I still hung out with my friends
even now I still hang out my friends and
all of that and just lucky that now this
is also my son like stinking solo I'm
just also looking at it's actually my
job and I can sit here and do it and I
don't worry about leaving for work at 4
o'clock I mean on your days off if you
have a couple hours to film a video I
would do it I believe that if you really
want to do YouTube and it's something
you're really passionate about you'll
make time for it because it's what you
love so when you use this contour
palette from Smashbox I'm going to use
this ashy tone right here to contour
underneath my cheekbones this is really
nice I also like to use this to bronze
so this is a blush I pretty much love
using with any luck this is in the shade
sensual just a good neutral kind of
blush it's not too cool not too warm and
it pretty much goes with everything and
it adds just a nice little little ashy
touch to your cheeks I really like it
and then we are going to highlight I
know you guys are so tarsem use this but
I just love using it so I'm going to
actually layer today I'm going to use
the lightest shade in this Perl palette
that Smashbox and I collab to create and
I'm going to bring this a little bit
more forward so I'm just going to do
this I like this because I can bring it
more forward and it doesn't look too
crazy because in photos if I'm looking
at you dead-on I want you to see the
glow and I'm going to take just a little
bit of this on safiya glow kit this is
the
that glow glow kick and I'm going to
take a little bit of these two mixed
right here in the center to really make
it pop also here whatever lip
okay so quickly I'm going to go off
camera I'm going to fill in my brows and
then I'll back to answer some more
questions and wrap up this look for you
guys also while I'm going I'm going to
apply lashes I just I'll just go ahead
and do that now I really want to try
these out I love absolutely love Lily
lashes and I don't think I've tried
these but they're the unique Hollywood
they look so pretty I've been really
loving Chloe lashes so much they're just
so full and glam and that's what I love
so I'm gonna apply these and my brow
products and I will be back to wrap up
this video almost it and finish filming
for you guys because I'll miss finish my
makeup off camera so these are the
lashes on and I did highlight with the
pro palette as well I love the way I
shadow looks it looks really good I like
the color combo I decided to go with I'm
still trying out some different brow
products right now I am actually trying
out this makeup forever brow liner and a
shade 10 it's very interesting it has
like a little liner brush like that I
have to do a lot of cleaning up and
everything but I'm just trying like
different techniques now I did line my
eyes with this pur cosmetics down was it
yeah down to earth eye liner which is a
brow liner and now we're going to go in
and finish up ci next question is what's
the longest time you and David have
spent apart due to the military you guys
know the story if you go watch a really
old videos I can meet my boyfriend's
video or something I will leave it down
below but he told you I was the story
and basically we spent all night with
each other pretty much like just hanging
out he actually left the next day for
Europe so like our relationship started
off on like him leaving all the time so
and he also is a West Point so when you
got back from Europe we had two weeks
together to like date and like see if we
liked each other you know so then we had
those two weeks together but then after
that we were pretty much long-distance
because of West Point and everything so
I feel like it's normal for us to be
long-distance I feel like for us to be
parts pretty normal but
it's really nice for us to like to have
time to be together as well but I think
the the longest time was definitely
without talking or anything was
definitely when he went to Ranger school
I think that would be hard in part
because we couldn't talk at all other
than through letters I didn't vlog as
well whenever I went through that whole
range of school stuff with him but I
think that was the hardest part it was
like what was it two three months of no
talking just letters Basava he got
through he got through and he did so
well so proud of him um so yeah it's all
worth it in the end I mean look now
we're living together was it one of your
favorite things to do on a date and we
just like to go out to dinner like try
new restaurants and stuff and like order
some drinks kind of relax I think that's
my favorite like date saying that we do
I just love trying out new restaurants
with him okay where's my pencil brush I
can't do anything so I find a pencil so
I think that's like one of my favorite
things is like just going on little
dates and especially now that we're in a
new area just trying different spots and
like who has the best food around here
are you and Amy's going to make it down
south for any football games this season
we are hoping so like I said it's going
to be a very busy end of the month or
not into the months well yes it is a
month but end of the year we will see if
we can I mean there's so much going on
these next few months I would love to go
I mean I live for football we'll be up
here like screaming yelling with lunch
people
I really gotten into baseball - since
meeting Davis and kind learning more
about it but football still like my
bread and butter even though I do wear
Clemson stuff into your arm Clemson I'm
still a die-hard Auburn fan someone also
asked where are you current what are
your current favorite TV Netflix series
and I really love Riverdale Riverdale
was one of those shows that I first sure
that I wasn't going to like because I
wasn't impressed with the acting at
first but the more I watched it the more
I fell in love with it and I was just so
intrigued and like trying to figure out
who did what was just so fun and I still
don't know who did what I just actually
retweeted a tweet that one of the cast
members now it was like 9 weeks till the
next premiere and I was like nobody
talked to me in nine weeks I will be
busy watching Riverdale I just got Davis
on
to supernatural because I used to watch
Supernatural back when I lived in my
apartment haze I remember I had bought
this bed that would like move up and
down and all I would do is literally go
to my room lift the bed up so like my
back was up facing the TV and I would
just watch Supernatural
and I loved that show I mean I've seen
so many episodes so like I'm watching it
all over again with Davis but I loved it
my favorite character is Dean I just
think he's so funny and throughout the
show he just becomes my favorite too so
if you hadn't watched it I don't let's
go a little bit
Dean is definitely my favorite we watch
pretty much like all the ones that
everybody talked about I've had a lot of
people's living pictures of my part in
just the darlings it list I was in that
movie just love Oh blood like the
tiniest part I was a teacher and that
was films like right when Davis and I
started dating it was a couple years ago
so yes I am the one in that movie I've
been seeing so many people tweet me
about and be like why did you tell us
and the reason why I did is because a I
did Balazs when I was there but I'm
pretty sure I couldn't tell you guys
what I was doing at the time I didn't
mention it and then I just forgot about
it I mean years go by you're like what I
was a little you know like I mean I
literally walked in that day and like
learn my lines that day like it was it
was nerve-wracking to say the least I am
in that and the teacher and I watched it
for the first time last night if you
follow me on snapchat you saw this is
the first time I will ever say I sound
similar to this person or like I will
never say I look similar to her because
I just don't see it but the for some
reason when I watched myself in this
movie I was like why do I sound library
stirs like in the opening part where I
first start I'm like oh my god I
literally sound like this is so creepy
you should go check it out as a cute
little movies it was fun to work with
all those people and everybody was so so
nice it was a good experience I was
super nervous though like I was sweating
I've had so many questions of people
asking me how's it like living a
military lifestyle and was it hard to
adjust I still don't feel like I'm
living a military lifestyle I don't know
that sounds weird or not but I keep to
myself a lot I did that at home as well
I always just cut to myself I'm always
in the house
always you know working I feel like work
is like such a big priority and
sometimes I don't know how to separate
work in life and I'm a big workaholic
kind of person I just love doing it
where I'm cleaning hope you see my blogs
you know but I know I don't feel like
I've suggested I mean like I told you
guys earlier me and Davis kind of our
relationship started off of
long-distance so like when he's gone
it's just it feels normal
in a way now when we first ended up here
I was like oh easy like I don't feel
like we've actually left home but then
it hit me a few weeks ago like up I am
very far from Georgia I always had the
option to leave is he like we're to
leave or something you know it's just I
just don't feel like anything's really
changed I don't feel like it the only
thing I feel like that is really changed
is just moving and where we've moved to
which has been an adjustment within
itself I don't feel like there's like a
different lifestyle for me I don't know
I had someone ask me how do you keep
your hair so healthy I've been dying my
hair blonde for a couple years and
they're so damaged now when I used to
dye my hair blonde like ogee YouTube
times I would like fried my hair I
really did I completely damaged my hair
how I used to get dyed but Jessica my
hairstylist
I'll leave her info down below I always
tag her she's in Atlanta and literally
she is this she never dries out my hair
she never damages my hair she uses
olaplex as well and it just works like
what she does to my hair like my hair
works with her we just worked so well
together and it never gets super damaged
and she doesn't do too much at once like
she knows what she's doing so I think
it's all about who you go to honestly
and we don't leave like bleach on or
whatever she uses for long at all if
she's super quick as well I don't know I
would ask her I'm like so dedicated
she's like one of my favorite hair
stylist I've ever had just personality
wise and work wise she's so bomb but I
will say like haircare wise it's
probably weird cuz I'm talking with lip
liner on but I don't wash my hair every
single day I use as much dry shampoo as
I can I have found that not washing my
hair as much has helped tremendously and
it's Linda's things where I do have an
oily like scalp like hair's got whatever
used to I wash my hair every day because
it would be so I li but then that made
it even worse so you have to like train
your
haier to not be watched every single day
and like really use dry shampoo really
take your time put your hair up if you
think it just looks gross and you know
train your hair to like knock it so oily
so quickly because the more you wash it
the more oily at least minded oh no I
think not washing it as much and I don't
put heat on my hair every single day
either I usually like chroma hair and
then I use those curls for the next few
days it just usually lasts for me
especially since I had cut my hair
shorter a while back that's pretty much
it and lately I do use heat protectant
Byway it's the memory mist it is a heat
protectant it's supposed to be like a
long lasting memory but this does
protect against the heat really really
well and I've noticed my hair is a
little bit shinier since I've been using
this so I do really like it
one more question I'm going to answer is
what is your go-to thing when you're
stressed about work I'm guessing this
means like those who go to things to do
then it's definitely working out I am
just having the shittiest day and I am
in the worst mood ever
I will go work out and I will feel so
much better about myself like it's just
something that I feel like is necessary
for me if I don't work out I'm literally
going to be a freakin basket case I'm
going to apply 1993 from urban decay
holy no I'm not like this dude are
supposed to be lighter since 1993 color
is so pretty but like that's not what I
was going for this is easy OP a liquid
velvet in delight nice warm nude yes
then I want to try this out this is DJ
cat lip tonics extreme shimmering topper
I mean I just look so pretty it's like a
nice bronzy pink color 15 B 1/2 I have
no idea what colors is it but it's just
like a bronzy type of color
that's pretty okay guys so this would be
completed look very full I hope you guys
enjoyed it I really like the way that
this turned out I think it looks it
really pretty so I hope you enjoyed this
