filming a chit chat get ready with me
answering some of your questions you
know giving you life updates everything
like that I've been talking about
wanting to do like a lighter fall makeup
look and that's what I'm gonna do in
this video just gonna talk to you do a
lighter fall look a bold lip cuz I've
done so many dramatic fall makeup look
okay not so many of them three but I've
done more fall dramatic lips than I have
naturals so I'm just gonna get comfy
we're just gonna get ready I do have a
flight to catch here in a little bit so
I'm gonna be going on the plane like
this so very excited so anyways if you
guys want to kind of catch up with me
get ready together and have me answer
some of your questions then let's just
go ahead and get started this thumb
didn't know where to go but we're gonna
get started okay so I'm gonna change it
up from what I normally do when I do
more of a lighter look I do my base
makeup first so that's what we're gonna
start off with I'm just gonna prime with
the Smashbox photo-finish water primer
but I'm also gonna try this new hard
candy sheer envy magnifying pore primer
stick and it says it instantly blurs
pores mattifying and I just want to test
this out I purchased it a few weeks ago
so I think it's about time to try it so
have you guys been doing even good I
filmed a video yesterday which you guys
will see very soon it was more of a
dramatic fall makeup look I've been so
busy lately I haven't been putting out
three videos a week just because if you
follow me on social media you know but I
am starting my own online boutique this
baby is starting from the ground and we
were working her up it is a lot of work
did start your own business honestly it
has been so much fun and I'm just so
excited to get it started we're actually
having a launch party this Saturday the
14th in Carrollton which is so exciting
and we're gonna have some pieces there
people can buy like exclusive items we
have so many cute things I had to like
resist and not take anything because
everything is so cute it's gonna be at
the party but yeah I'm starting my own
online boutique so if you don't follow
me on social media you wouldn't know
that but I'm very excited I've talked
about this and wanting my own dog line
which hopefully will happen soon and a
lot of you were so supportive on
Instagram so thank you so much if you
left a sweet comment we're not shipping
international
the first go-around just because you
know I feel like we kind of need to get
a feel for everything but we will be
shipping international very very soon I
promise you this it's been a journey
trying to learn the process and get
things trademarked and get all the
attorneys together and just it's been an
ordeal so that's what I've been up to if
you're wondering like where the heck is
Casey yeah she's never snapchatting
anymore she's never on YouTube I'm
trying to at least do two videos a week
if anything one not like me normally I
do the three videos a week I promise you
once I get this all under control we
will be back to normal and we'll be
doing good I'm gonna just use the
wet-and-wild photo focus foundation
today just really wanting to use it
again it's been a while since I've used
this product so I know I told you guys
in a previous video I think it was like
fall drugstore makeup video that I had
another L'Oreal sponged I had just
purchased and it was different which it
was different okay
this one I had in my product refills
drawer and I was like oh I gotta see if
that one's the same this is the exact
same this is the blender that I loved
from L'Oreal like when I started using
this this was the blender it's just
perfect but the other blender I use like
I swear they changed it because it's
just not the same it's not like this
luckily I found an old one that I
purchased cuz when I find something I
like I normally purchase quite a few of
them and then just keep it in my product
refills drawer so that way you know I
have backups but I'm super happy I found
this because it's one of my favorite
sponges from the drugstore but I swear
they've changed like the new sponge it's
not the same it's just nice so yeah
that's kind of what I've been up to
um not too much other than that going on
to do have another collab and the works
for you guys
I think you're really gonna like it so
that's really exciting as well it's just
been a really crazy year so thankful and
blessed I'm so know I'm so grateful for
you guys because you are so supportive
and I don't know man it's just been it's
been a wild freaking year Wow here it
it's just crazy I can't even describe to
you and I'm really thankful and I'm
excited for the future and honestly I'm
just trying to like plan ahead you know
what I mean I've always wanted to have
more businesses I mean YouTube's a
really great business for me
I'm doing really well right now and I
figured while I can I might as well
accomplish other dreams that I have so
the boutique is one and then hopefully
one day I could do the dog line but it
is so hard to get resources for that so
hard so I'm gonna go in with tart shape
tape and light medium and then I'm gonna
go real quick on my Twitter cuz I asked
you guys on Twitter ask me your
questions and I got quite a bit so we'll
just go on there Wendy oh and Davis plan
on starting a family I get this question
so much not anytime soon probably like
the next two years I would say I mean if
it was up to Davis we would have kids
now but I don't want a kid right now
just because I'm just very motivated
with these new businesses and I really
just want to like plant my feet before
you know I have any kids once I get
everything kind of organized and ready
to go then we will but probably in the
next like year or two would you ever
design shirts that said Casey Holmes
made me buy or other designs
specifically about your channel I would
love to have like a merch items like
that maybe one day let me know if you
guys don't want to see that down below I
would definitely include it like on the
boutique I just have to figure out a
resource to make those shirts what's
your favorite adult beverage and what
your top three favorite lip colors um
favorite adult beverage right now is let
me find the picture I showed you guys on
snapchat I love this beer I believe they
make this beer here in New York and it
is amazing I had it out of place called
spokes here in Watertown take a picture
up it sells like I have to buy some of
these and Davis ended up buying me a
six-pack while I was gone
it's called blueberry ale and it's by
Blue Point so that's what it looks like
can you see that it's really dark but
it's so good oh my gosh you guys I'm a
beer girl I even though it's like got so
many calories and carbs it's such a
freakin I don't know man I love beer but
another thing that I really like is
sparkling what's it called I showed you
don't snapchat too so if you ever want
to know what alcohol drinks I'm liking
normally I show them on snapchat a lot
but there's some sort of sparkling
alcohol beverage I forget what it's
called
I'll put it probably in the description
box below if I can remember but it is
pretty good it kind of just tastes like
water and it has Alka
all super low carb and low calorie and
that's really good too if you just want
something to kind of get you feeling
good
low carb that's a way to go though the
lip color I really like right now is
actually downstairs cuz I took it out
with me last night but it is called
cowboy and it's from the L'Oreal liquid
lipstick line so good I love it if
you're wondering where my case is from
it's where I'm at Etsy account you guys
know crazy over this and I totally get
it because I would crazy over it
found this Etsy account randomly and I
was like oh my god I have to have a case
from her I ended up ordering one which I
will leave it down below he didn't know
I was gonna mention her because I
literally was just strolling through
Etsy and I loved it and I posted it on
snapchat and she sent me an email she
was like oh my gosh thank you so much
for mentioning me on your snapchat she
was super grateful said she had to move
her processing days from like one two
three days to two to three weeks I love
things like that you know where I just
mentioned something to you guys and you
all go and support another business
owner I just think that's amazing so
thank you for doing that I mean I don't
get any discounts or anything from it I
don't expect any discount if I get a
product that I really love like whether
it's lifestyle Beauty whatever I feel
like it's just so important to mention
it and I just think it's important to
also not expect anything out of it like
I don't expect anything from it I mean
she offered me like free cases for
whatever but I'm not gonna use her for
that you know what I'm saying so I think
it's just really important when you find
something you love to spread the word
about it and help support others how did
you train your hair not to get so greasy
- Oh gross after two days it's
definitely just about really not washing
it like even if your hair is greasy
after two days you just kind of need to
let it do its thing
put it up in a bun leave it there put
some dry shampoo in there as much as you
can it is a process I mean it took me
like I would say a like six months or so
to really train my hair to not get so
greasy I do notice it gets really really
really oily whenever I wash my hair more
like if I need to wash my hair for an
event or something and I just washed it
it gets so oily I just really try to
make sure I don't wash it very often by
shampoo helps so much I love this
batiste won this is like my all-time
favorite by the way losing this Smashbox
contour palette the batiste one's one of
my favorites I've never found anything
to top it to be honest with you someone
also asked do I wash my hair on days
that I work out no I do not I just load
it up with dry shampoo unless like
Davidson they go for a run and it's
super greasy then I will like if I sweat
a lot but normally I can get away with
just doing a lot of dry shampoo what
tips do you have about wedding planning
what have you found to be the most
helpful I'll be honest with you guys I
didn't want to plan the wedding I wanted
someone to do it for me just because I
knew I wouldn't have time to plan a
wedding if I did it myself we wouldn't
have a wedding until like three years
from now having a planner really helped
even if you could have like friends and
family to really really help you with
everything I think that's the best way
to go I wouldn't take it all on yourself
it's just too much it really is like
even now that we're getting super close
I'm getting so many you know text
messages and emails about things and I'm
let go so just make sure you have
someone there to help you I think that's
the biggest tip don't try to plan it on
your own someone asked well Davis wear
his uniform to the wedding and yes he
will
how big is your wedding party and guest
list so our bridal party is for
bridesmaids for groomsmen and then we
have I think 183 or 185 guests completed
like finalized someone asked Alabama
meet up any jewelry pieces and Rosie
days so I'm not having any meetups any
time soon the only like meetup that I'm
having is my Rosie days
launch party that we're having this
Saturday cuz I'll be there like
socializing I wanted to see you guys
meet you you know tell you thank you for
coming but I will have jewelry at some
point for Rosie days I just have to find
what I love you know what I mean like
I'm super picky to what comes on the
store and I want it to make sense and
right now I haven't found any jewelry
pieces that just makes sense for the
store I definitely plan on having some
though because I like jewelry it's just
I got to find the right item you know
what I mean so funny because I ordered
all this stuff for the boutique before I
announced it and I for sure thought like
when I announced it I would feel so
comfortable with how many items that I
had but then when we announce it you
guys gave an overwhelming response to
all the products which I am so grateful
for especially like a little
graphic tees I didn't know if people are
gonna love graphic tees because I feel
like they're hit and miss sometimes like
you got to find the right ones
but you guys went crazy over like my mom
life tees some of y'all thought I was
pregnant I was like no I'm just modeling
this it's so cute and so comfortable and
I had to buy more of that but I still
feel like I don't have enough so I'm a
little nervous but we have quite a bit
so I'm hoping we'll be good but it's so
funny cuz I'm like I for sure thought I
was set and then I had plenty of stuff
but now I'm like oh gosh someone asked
what are you gonna be for Halloween
honestly I haven't had time to think
about Halloween I don't think I'm
dressing up for Halloween to be honest
with you so probably nothing this year
what are you most looking forward to for
your wedding so for the wedding like
before everyone goes into the reception
they're gonna give us some time like
probably 10-15 minutes to go into the
reception and like see everything I
think I'm most excited to see everything
come together that we've been working on
so I think that moment when Davis and I
get to go into the reception and just go
oh my gosh here it is like this is it I
think that's what I'm most excited for
because that's gonna be the biggest bang
like where we're having it the outside
is beautiful enough you don't have to do
much to it at all
it's the reception I mean the reception
is beautiful as well but it's the
reception where you know you really get
to kind of make it your own and I feel
like like meeting with our florist and
everything oh it's gonna be so pretty I
can't wait for you guys to see it
I cannot cannot wait someone asked if
I've ever considered interior design and
I would love to do that but honestly
I'll be completely honest with you I am
not talented enough to be an interior
designer
it's just not my forte like if I looked
at a blank house like yes I could figure
it out but I feel like there's other
people who do a really great job at it
and I'm just I'm not that person I
definitely feel like I can you know
decorate my own house but I follow so
many people on Instagram by the way I'm
using the spotlight palette to highlight
I follow like the well-dressed house
that on Instagram
it's my goals they are my goals they
have the best house stuff and I follow a
few other people I can't remember their
names off the top of my head I mean
that's where I get a lot of in spoke
from and sometimes
like Oh one day my house will look like
that I hope any advice on someone who
wants to start a business themselves
whether it's online an online store or
just in general any tips my biggest tip
is just to do it just do it I mean
there's it's like Nike but really though
like I stopped there for so long I was
like oh I would love to have my own
boutique oh I would love to have this is
this and then finally I was like you
know what screw it I'm gonna do it like
I'm so tired of saying oh maybe I'll do
it one day whenever I'm tired like even
before we moved I knew I wanted to start
a boutique and I was thinking I was like
okay if it snows up here and I have a
warehouse how am I gonna get to the
warehouse what's the clothing gonna be
like will shipping be delayed because of
snow if it gets really bad like I even
thought about stuff like that and then I
was finally like you know what I can do
this I'm just gonna do it in Georgia
mainly - for tax purposes because I did
not want my business here in New York
for tax reasons if you have a dream and
you want to do something find a way to
do it start out small figure out ways to
make it happen I mean you can only tell
yourself something so much and if you
just let it go you're always gonna
regret not executing that dream that you
have so also before you hire people to
help you you know see if there's people
around you that know things try to have
meetings with people who do the same
thing as you to me I kind of feel like
some people get either
I feel like threatens the wrong word but
I feel like they get a little defensive
when someone wants to start the same
business as them but have their own kind
of style and stuff and I find that crazy
because this this world is so big and
there's so many people in this world
that I feel like there's enough room for
everyone that's kind of like the same
with YouTube videos like who doesn't do
YouTube right now you know what I mean
as long as someone's willing to help you
like try to have meetings with people
and see what they recommend get some
tips and you know just try to have some
resources do a ton of research that's
what I did I did so much research on
boutique before I even started mine I
had a lot of legal help no matter how
small your business is I feel like legal
is so important like have a lawyer look
some stuff over let you know
you need to change what do you need to
do and you should be good I mean it's
all about getting up and doing it like
I'm going to tell you how my kind of
thought process worked with business and
like being successful so when I first
became like single and business started
really taking off with YouTube I did
whatever I wanted to do with my money I
saved yes like for the house that I had
or that I have I saved and did all that
but I also enjoyed myself I spent money
on nice purses nice shoes and all this
other kinds of stuff like without a care
in the world because I didn't have a
plan and I didn't have things that I
wanted to do but as I've gotten older
and as I've like decided okay I need I
need to really think about it and you
know have a game plan for things it all
kind of changed I've put together in my
mind like this list of things that I
wanted to do and finally I've just been
able to execute it I'm so happy that I
bought a house because if I didn't buy a
house when I did I feel like I still
would have been in that like spending
mode type of thing and like just I mean
you can enjoy yourself there's nothing
wrong with enjoying yourself if you have
the ability to do something and you have
the ability to spend money on things do
it I'm so happy about the house because
my mindset completely changed I mean
don't get me wrong I still buy nice
things every now and then but even now
like my mindset isn't oh I want that new
Chanel bag that just came out I need
this shoe I need this new thing now my
mindset is on ok this top is really cute
for the business I want to get that ok
so I need to get storage units I need to
get this and now my money goes towards
like what can I do to expand what can I
do to make this business better this was
a very long rant this is a very long
rant but I just kind of want to tell you
guys like it's okay to enjoy yourself
it's ok to spend that money but just
think about the future as well like what
do you want to do it's all about having
a game plan because some things aren't
gonna last forever YouTube's not gonna
last forever for me I really hope all of
that made sense because I feel like
there was a question that I should have
answered and I felt like I answered it
but then I went on a tangent also I just
used the makeup revolution brow pomade
I'm back to this because I feel like
palm maids are just easier for me we
just work together better I'm going to
go into the tartlet toasted palette
everybody's been talking about this I'm
not gonna do too much I'm just going to
kind of
go in with different colors first one
I'm going to take it's more and I'm just
gonna put this all over my lid just to
set the concealer that we put on I would
never normally prime with concealer but
since we're doing such like lighter
basic shadows today I just went ahead
and did it because it doesn't really
matter if it creases or not I have my
ring back I had to get it resized to fit
my band for our ceremony and people were
like where's her ring I was wearing my
quello ring which I love I wear that
whenever I work out but I was like it's
just getting resized it's okay it's just
funny I feel like people want to assume
the worst first and then and then
they'll be okay
but everything is good over here also if
you're wondering about the top I'm
wearing this is also gonna be at my
store like has tighter ends and like
really cute slits at the top I love this
it's like a peachy color this will be on
rosy days calm which also I didn't even
tell you guys but we do have a snapchat
we have a Facebook and an Instagram so
if you want to check out our social
it'll be down below in the description
box someone else asked if we're gonna
have a wedding video and yes we will I
will definitely have a wedding video for
you guys because I think it's important
to include you in the process I mean you
guys have seen my life unfold and I
definitely hired a really good
videographer that I am so excited about
I love wedding videos they're like my
favorite pastime on Facebook I feel like
I see so many wedding videos on Facebook
it's not even funny but I love it I love
watching them like this has quite a bit
of fall out this shadow this candle
shadow has like a a lot of fall out
actually it's pretty but have you guys
tried this palette let me know what you
think I mean it's pretty but I'm not
going to use falsies I'm just going to
put on some mascara so I need to curl my
lashes when I was in Georgia I forgot to
bring my eyelash curler and oh my gosh
let me tell you biggest difference
not having an eyelash curler it is awful
I'm gonna use this volume stylist
18-hour lash extensions mascara this is
a really great mascara it's very
volumizing black one of my favorites
it's only a few dollars someone saying
you said you want to change your hair
but not until after the wedding what
color are you thinking I liked the dark
red violet let me know if you guys have
been here since the lush cherry days I
used to dye my own hair and
cherry was the color I always used and I
used to get at Sally's and it was such a
pretty color I have to say I do love
that color but I don't think I'll go
that dark again if anything I think I'll
go more brunette with like warm
highlights or something I just don't I
don't know cuz even when I went and got
my hair done last week I loved that I
went a little bit blonder it's just one
I don't know I really like the blonde
and to get back to this blonde if we
were to diet darker would be so hard I
mean this was a process and as it is you
know I'm just gonna go ahead and use one
of these l'oreal infallible lippies I'm
actually gonna use a shade shake down
like it would look good with this look
now I'm just gonna apply a lip liner
this is just I just grabbed the most
random lip liners how's the time you
don't even matter but this is the shade
earth from BH Cosmetics and then again
I'm gonna take the shade shake down OOP
it's pretty it's pretty I kind of feel
like it doesn't go with the eyeshadow
but I really need to wash my hair so
like the fact that I'm not I'm not gonna
curl it cuz I'm gonna have to wash it
tomorrow anyways I wish I was one of
those people that could like get away
with like super sleek straight hair like
and tucked behind their ears a little
bit but I just can't do that look so
that is it for this video I really hope
you guys enjoyed this really simple look
and enjoy kind of just chit-chatting and
listening to me ramble for forever um
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you guys in my next video
just where he was me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
