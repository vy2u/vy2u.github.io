trying to find three different outfits
for under $150 depending on what we can
find
trying to do three fall outfits so
obviously the first is for everyone I
want to try to find some things that you
guys can get pretty easily so we're
going to hit 41 hmm
targets and just hopefully in those
three slots so you can find can get up
okay so first off went really well
found a couple outfits from forever 21
and I also got a pair of jeans from H&amp;amp;M
I don't know if I'm going to wear those
jeans and one of these outfits because
they were $50 they were kind of
expensive but I didn't find like any
really affordable tops they're like it's
like I thought I would okay guys so we
are at Target hopefully you can find
yourself here
maybe on sale I have really shot at a
target clothing a while so it's good
sharp eyes
you don't seem to get it okay guys so
I'm going to do a quick clip in between
my shopping and then the final outfits
because I just wanted to pop on here and
like tell who sinned okay so really
quickly want to come on here and tell
you everything is affordable and some
pieces I did use in multiple outfits
just because it was super easy that way
and you shouldn't have to feel like you
can only wear one piece of an outfit a
certain way you can always reuse it I
think that's why everybody buys things
right you can always reuse it in a
different outfit to create either a
different vibe make it more casual make
it dressy so that's what's gonna happen
in these clips that you're about to see
I will have everything listed down below
by outfit I think I have six which is a
lot more than three which is what I was
aiming to get when I first started this
video we listed down below in the order
that they're shown and I will also have
everything listed on my blog as well if
you have not checked out my vlog I will
link it down below so without further
adieu I'm sure you're tired of me
talking so let's go start with the
outfit
I hope you like them
I've been feeling so small okay guys so
this first outfit the top is from Target
the pants are from Target as well I love
these jeans they fit so well the purse
is from forever 21 and so are the shoes
I really like the shoes they kind of
have a rustic look to them and I just
think they are adorable I'm gonna skip
my break so we're gonna make mistake I
just wanna feel bad it's just what I do
when I sew so for this outfit the dress
was actually only 1290 which is crazy I
got in a couple colors it's from forever
21 these booties as well are from
forever 21 I love the lace detail and
then the purse is from forever 21 I
think this outfit looks so nice and it's
a really great easy going out outfit
that doesn't cost a fortune
you
so this outfit is really great because
it's really simple the dress is actually
really great quality and it was only
1290 as well the green that little
jacket I have on it to kind of dress it
down is from forever 21 and then I
reused the same bag and the shoes are
from forever 21 no this is my top you're
gonna be myself or it could be someone
okay so for this one the top is from
Target the jeans are the same jeans I
wore in the first clip as well as the
same purse and then these shoes are from
Target as well I really like them they
kind of have a cowgirl vibe and I just
think it's super cute to go along with
this outfit
so for this outfit I'm wearing the dress
from forever 21 is the same as the black
one just in a rust color the same
forever 21 Jacket boots and purse so
switching up a couple items really
changes up an outfit and gives you a
different look
you
so for this outfit I literally just took
the black outfit I wore the other day
and I put a cardigan over top this
cardigan was on sale for 1290 at forever
21 and it just gives you a completely to
revive looks more casual and I really
like it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video enjoyed seeing how to switch up
some different outfits by just switching
out pieces you don't have to spend a lot
of money to get a lot of outfits I hope
you enjoyed this video if you did don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and I'll
try to do more like it in the future
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
