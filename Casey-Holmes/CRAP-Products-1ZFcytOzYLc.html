products video I'm excited to do it
because I love seeing like crap product
videos and what people really don't like
before I go buy stuff I think it's
really helpful um and I have a couple
things people really like in here so I'm
just gonna go ahead and say uh you know
these just did not work for me and they
don't work for my skin I worked my hair
whatever um they just didn't work for me
if they work a few fantastic but they
did not work for me so yeah sorry the
first thing I'm going to show you is
this not your mother's beach bay beach
babe texturizing sea salt spray and I
wanted this to be like the bumble and
bumble one if you guys ever seen that
one you know when you get out of the
beach and you have like that gorgeous
hair like whenever it dries up or
whatever and it's like gorgeous beach
waves and it's just Oh amazing that's
what I want I thought this would kind of
help with that I didn't do anything to
my hair my hair was super flat and it
just it didn't show any kind of texture
or like any waviness to my hair it was
horrendous so I don't like this product
it's a complete waste of money and I
just don't like it
the next thing is something that people
rave about here on YouTube and like I
said these just didn't work for me so
these are the L'Oreal True Match
foundations they look like this I know
you guys have seen these they've been
raved about so many times I got the
colors w6
beige Sundays and w5 sand beige so um
when I apply this I applied it with a
brush I apply it with my hands I've
tried many different ways these don't
work with my skin
they look so cakey and so disgusting
it's horrendous I hate the color I feel
like the colors too like orange E or
yellow I don't know it's total waste of
money on these products I had high hopes
for them but I really really really just
hate them so that's the problem and I'm
not gonna like when I applied it with a
brush
you could see the foundation on my skin
like it was gross it was I don't know it
just like didn't seep into my skin like
it should have so it was just like caked
on and it just was not cute and then you
put powder over it and it was worse so
it wasn't working for me another
foundation I have I loved it but my skin
hated it and that was the Mac Studio Fix
fluid foundation I was in in to be 40
lookout tan I was just my summer camp
uhm but okay I literally love this
foundation the coverage and stuff but
holy cow what doesn't like what does Mac
put in their face products that makes
you just completely break out like I
broke out so bad it was ridiculous and I
was like holy cow this is not good I
ain't it was summertime so my skin was
extra Willy and all this other stuff it
just did not work so this is definitely
a crap product I don't know what Mac has
in their foundations but they seriously
need to get it out because I've not I'm
not the only one that says that they
break that Mac breaks their skin out so
whatever you have in there Mac take it
out and I swear you will have like the
best foundation in the world okay now I
have my scaris these two are from NYC I
got the Showtime NYC and the city curls
in my seat and I got these because they
were having to sell at Rite Aid so I
figured I'd pick them up and try them
out because they're only a couple
dollars let me just show you guys how
ridiculous these are okay so this is a
city curls now they did curve the wand
as you can see but I wish I had like
complete HD these bristles are not even
like a centimeter long maybe the ones
own like the outer end but these ah
these are so tiny there's no link to the
bristle it doesn't catch my eyelashes it
doesn't apply the mascara like it should
it pretty much just glides on and like
it doesn't do anything I don't know it's
absolutely horrendous so that is that
one and then the Showtime one is
basically the same exact thing and the
wand is just straight it just did not
work basically if you
this on your natural lashes it doesn't
lift them it doesn't curve them it
doesn't make them thicker it just puts
crappy mascara product on your lashes
and it's Ernesto I don't like that the
next thing you guys have seen and heard
me say I hate it I said it in a hall I
do believe and it's the bronze booster
from Physicians Formula just looks like
this it's got the little bronzing beads
of course she opened it up has this puff
and these bronzing beads like I said in
that video you don't see the color its
sheer it's absolutely a waste of money
for how much you spent on Physicians
Formula I have like the biggest
love-hate relationship with them because
some things are fine and I really truly
love and some things like this just
pissed me off because they're super
expensive and they don't have any color
payoff it's like it's not even a glow
it's just it's not there it's not there
at all so um and this is a medium to
dark medium to dark so yeah I hate this
product I would never ever ever
recommend it to anybody the next thing
is a lipstick and I did show this in the
hall - it's the super stay 14 hour
lipstick and it's in the color beige for
good now I did say I love this color
which I do the color is really pretty
when you swatch it um that's it as a
nude I hate the smell it stains my lips
like my lips aren't dry when I put this
on there there's nothing wrong with my
lips but when I put this formula all my
lips they sting so bad I don't know what
it is about it it just it hurts my lips
and it feels really weird and I do not
like it so the formula of this is just a
no-go the smell I hate it all so I mean
I hate it all the color is nice but I
hate everything else just just but next
thing is this Fox in a box blush and
this is in smooth-talker and this is
what it looks like now looking at this
you kind of think like Oh that'd be
pretty like for a bronzy kind of look
you know some things you just kind of
like oh I don't know like a bronzy glow
like the colors are really pretty well
let me see
and we kind of get these colors they
just watch it because I want you guys to
see but those are the colors okay now I
was thinking with like the orange and
yellow and the darker color like the
darker brown I was just thinking it'd be
more like a bronzy pretty color no this
thing basically acts like it has no
color payoff at all doesn't show up on
my skin at all it's just like a very
very very light peach color I absolutely
hate it
and I love the spicy and sweet one this
one's fantastic but this one is just
like misleading to me I don't know okay
so the next product is probably one of
the worst products I've ever tried in my
life
it is the Milani body bronzer and it
looks like this i got this on there on
sale at CVS oh my gosh
so you open it up the smell is okay the
snow you can deal with and that's what
it looks like now look at this color
this is supposed to be a body bronzer
and just check this out now tell me how
in the world is that supposed to be a
rhyme xur Wow
I mean come on Milani this is just
ridiculous
um absolutely hate this product it does
have shimmer in it I mean it's like
they're trying to chrome out your tan or
something it just looks absolutely
ridiculous and if I had a friend that
had this on I'd be like girl you need to
go take another shower because that is
just hideous
so I mean I don't get this I don't get
it I mean people say oh we could put on
your shoulders or whatever and it'll be
really pretty no it's not cute it will
never be cute like it's just hideous
it's it's orange and yellow I mean it's
just disgusting so that was a total
waste of money
no wonder right with 75% off right and
then the last thing is a hair product
and it's the chiere and I do have a box
so I wanted us in a contest and this is
the expert baby
okay first of all I do love the cheese
styling products like you guys all have
the keratin mist and I have the Iron
Guard he protected right I love those
this is actually absolutely horrible I
hate their styling like tools I don't
like them there's no heat setting on
this um it grabs your hair so bad and
actually for people with my length this
is so pointless like what I'm gonna
spend 10 years with this thing and I
just I don't know I hate it it really
seriously grabs your hair because this
kind of material like this plastic key
kind of a turn on the outside just
really grabs the hair and then not to
mention this little spring on the inside
listen to it it's like clicking and if
your hair gets caught in that girl you
you're gonna be hurt in so I think it's
just stupidest cheapest product ever
from Qi I absolutely hate it I was gonna
try to give to a friends and I said no I
don't want to do that to my friends so
yeah that's pretty much that stuff so I
hope you guys enjoy my crap products
video I'm gonna have to figure out how
to get this orange off my hand now if
you I'm having a crop products that you
don't like leave a comment down below
and let me know I'm totally interested
in knowing something go buy all this
crap again and yeah I'll see you all in
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
