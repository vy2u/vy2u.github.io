a crap products video I have a quite a
bit of stuff to show you guys some of it
is expensive is expensive expensive some
of its trucks store and then I have to
self tanners in here so by the way it is
like rainy here and disgusting so if the
lighting kind of changes I'm sorry um
just so you guys know these products
didn't work for me if they work for you
fantastic don't take offence if I call a
product that you like crap because you
know we all have different opinions and
yeah so don't take it personal I lot
I know a lot of people did in my last
crap products video um which yeah if you
haven't seen it I'll link it right here
but yeah so don't take any offense to it
it just didn't work for me the first
thing is this quick tan sunless tanning
spray and aerosol aerosol thing and I
was buy body drench this is what it
looks like and I hate this stuff because
it smells awful but it gives you like a
red orange tan like it doesn't give you
a bronzy color it gives you like a
reddish tint
and it doesn't look cute so I don't like
this at all and I really really really
don't recommend it itself that's the
first one and then the second one this
was like such a neat idea you guys
probably like what the hell it's one of
those where you can like take the
self-tanner out which this is the sheer
tan self-tanner
it is spray and take you can do it like
you could take it out and spray the
front of your body wherever you can
reach and then you click it in here and
then you can go behind your back and
stuff really great idea only if the
self-tanner actually was decent the
color does not show on my skin at all I
didn't even know what I was applying it
so me I like this they should make them
to where you can put different self
tanners in here because it's only made
for like this one I've tried to stick
other ones in here and it just doesn't
work so that stinks but cool idea not
good product though it doesn't show up
so okay next is some Bed Head products
or haircare first one is this dumb
blonde shampoo for after highlights for
damaged or chemically treated hair I
absolutely hate this stuff it is nothing
for me it actually makes it even more
dry in like a damaged filling so I don't
like this at all and if you know about
Bed Head Punk's you know that these are
pretty expensive so I was not happy with
this and then the next Bed Head one is
also the dumb blonde care line and it's
the Reconstructor for after highlights
damage while the wall chelation
chemically treated hair these two
actually kind of smell decent and
usually I don't like the way Ben head
products smell but this the same thing
it did nothing for my hair and actually
left it feeling more damaged so that
sucked
now I'm two more hair products and I
have just a few makeup products the
first hair product is this nourishing
coconut milk weightless moose from
organics and if you watch or if you
follow me on instagram you saw that I
did purchased this not too long ago and
I absolutely hate it it's not even a
mousse it's kind of like false
advertisement but you know it doesn't
say just shake it up or anything like
that but I still shook it up because it
said it was a mousse so figured you had
to shake it up take my ring off but this
is how it comes out like liquid like
there's no loose to that like it's just
it's not a mousse and it just it really
did nothing for my hair except really
really dry out my ends so I didn't like
this at all but the coconut milk line
smells so good it's just the only thing
I like is the serum the anti-breakage
serum but that mousse is just horrible
so I don't recommend that at all next
one is one people are gonna be like oh I
love that stuff and I don't know I just
didn't work for my hair I tried so hard
to like it and I couldn't it's the
hydrating macadamia oil from organics
the intensive moisture mask I know a lot
of people like to compare this to the or
has like a cheaper alternative to the
macadamia hair mask this has nothing on
that mask personally it what I think I
think it has nothing on it this is it
doesn't like I don't know it doesn't do
anything for me like the macadamia hair
mask my hair will be so soft for like
five days straight
city when they gets off for the night
and I even tried leaving this in
overnight and seeing how it work out and
it just didn't do anything so me didn't
work for me okay on to makeup the first
thing I'm back on first thing I want to
talk about is this a baby lips and this
is in a quench now I was excited to try
it out because I do have a cherry wine
it's somewhere that I got in a swap and
I actually like that one um it just
leaves like a red tint to my lip so I
don't wear it often but um this one I
was really excited cuz it was clear it
was in a cute little blue case and I
literally opened it out I smelt it and
the smell makes me so nauseous but when
I first smelled it I was like okay you
know what I can work with this la la so
I've been all over my lips and literally
like a minute later I had to scrub my
lips because I felt so nauseous like I
could just smell my lips and it was
horrible so I absolutely don't like this
product at all I didn't know if you
could return it or not um whatever like
seriously I still have the packaging and
stuff I I could not take it look so
gross okay next I have two mascaras the
first one is the Rimmel scandaleyes
mascara some people like this some
people don't it's just pretty much
personal preference really it's a hit
miss the brush is way too big and
honestly this did nothing for my lashes
like usually I'm okay with big you know
wands but this is ridiculous and the
packaging too I feel like it's just way
way way too big I feel like I'm holding
an extra-large Poorna marker in my hand
I just I don't like it at all so I don't
recommend this one and then this one's
one that was right about for literally
like such a long time I think it still
is
it's the l'oreal voluminous million
lashes yeah I don't like it it is
absolutely nothing for me and I really
hate the wand too
it's just the rubberized wand but I mean
I'm okay with rubberized once because I
like the covergirl lash perfection but
like this one kind of hurts my eyes so I
don't like this at all next is
Physicians Formula concealer you guys
know about me in physicians for
very very love-hate and this is an
absolutely hate as well this is a
perfecting concealer duo and yellow
light but it has basically a yellow
concealer to help conceal your dark
circles and then like a like skin tone
one - wow I look really orange right now
hello and a really like a skin tone
color to help cover up the yellow ok
these are not creamy at all and look
like the concealer just pops right out
like what is this not cute but like the
consistency is so rough and like you can
tell when you swatch them like it's just
not a good concealer at all I don't know
they didn't work for me if you like that
kind of consistency where it's one of
those really really really really really
thick cakey concealers maybe you'll like
it but no I don't think so I don't like
this
it's just ridiculous on slamming so Boo
Physicians Formula okay the next thing
is this Rimmel stay matte pressed powder
I showed this in a hall a wahi ole back
and it is in transparent just looks like
that I really just don't like this
product because it just has a powdery
consistency even when I use a kabuki
with it it's just like way too powdery
so that's it right there I just I don't
like it at all doesn't work for me it's
not fine enough like the powder isn't
that fine
so I don't recommend this to more
products I have this NYX lipstick and
summer love this did not work for me the
color I mean the consistency is great
but the color was so bad but this is
what it looks like it kind of made me
look like an ice princess I don't know
it did not work for me in my skin tone
it just made my lips look so like pale
and shiny it didn't work so that's a
boob product and then the last one is
this Milani from powder bronzer and 0/1
light
this is way too orange like seriously
way too orange this is what it looks
like I don't personally for my skintone
I do not like this if you like it good
for you
the elf one is definitely more of a
brown which I like some people can't
really use the Browns because they're
too muddy but you could see the
difference in the elf and the Milani one
it just didn't work from so I hope you
guys enjoy this video I hope it was kind
of informative to show you guys you know
what I don't like I know a bunch of
people watch these to kind of see what
people you know don't recommend and
these are just punks that um like I said
didn't work for me they might work for
you but so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this and don't forget to subscribe and I
will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
