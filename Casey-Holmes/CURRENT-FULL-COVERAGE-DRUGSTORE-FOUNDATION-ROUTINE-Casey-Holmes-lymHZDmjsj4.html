favourites you're gonna know what some
of these products are but I know that I
have some new subscribers and if you're
just tuning into this video then you
probably don't know what my favorites
are and how they look and how they cover
and you just want something full glam
but affordable you know I'm saying so I
figured I film is today so if any of you
had any questions I want my current
foundation routine is for a full
coverage finish I could just direct you
to this one and you'll see all my
favorite products so I hope you guys
enjoy this video if you have any
favorite products for your foundation
concealer powders all of that definitely
leave it in the comments below
start a conversation I think we're all
here to find some amazing new products
so definitely put those in the comments
below if you're not subscribed already
be sure to hit that subscribe button
before you leave and yeah let's just go
ahead and get started
first things first is primer the only
drugstore primer that I have found that
really works for me is the soap &amp;amp; Glory
one heck of a block primer I feel like
most primers in the drugstore are geared
more towards dry combo or normal skin
haven't really found anything that works
really well with my oily skin and if it
says it works for oily skin I'll try it
and sometimes it's just a little too
greasy it looks like a film and it just
doesn't work so this one is the one that
I have found that helps fill in my pores
keeps me matte and just creates a nice
smooth base for my foundation to lay on
top of and it also helps extend the wear
of foundation so this is the soap &amp;amp;
Glory one heck of a blot primary this
one is fantastic you'd get it
Target Ulta Walgreens there I feel like
they're being sold pretty much in a lot
of places right now and they're one heck
of a blot foundation is pretty amazing
too so definitely check that out those
two together work really well so I just
like to put this mainly in the center of
my face and then just work it out so if
you're new to my channel I do have
rosacea that's all that redness that
you're seeing whenever I play makeup I'm
either full coverage or bare face
there's no like in-between ever
I don't like light coverage foundations
I don't even like medium coverage
foundations for the most part I love a
good medium just
coverage like mainly full coverage if I
use more of a medium coverage foundation
and used to be buildable to full
coverage or something that I can help
get a fuller coverage with with a
concealer you know what it means as you
guys know if you've been following me my
favorite foundation at the moment is the
LA girl Pro matte HD long wear
foundation this is so good
so good I love this one I have four
different shades we have medium beige
light tan beige and then Sam Sann does
oxidize as well as light tan so just be
warned of that sand probably oxidizes
the most on me but the other ones don't
really oxidize that bad so today I think
I'm gonna be medium beige is just what
we're just gonna rock today I do have a
little bit of a tan I could probably go
a light tan but it might be a little
dark so we'll just see when I put this
on my hand but it just has a frosted
glass like this I believe it's nine to
ten dollars depending on where you get
it they do have more colors last I
checked on la girl they have more colors
on their website than they do on Ulta
comm and this is the color right there
that might be a little light so I'm
gonna take just a tiny bit of light tan
and put that in there like that
first drugstore tool is the Real
Techniques face and body sponge you
could obviously use the regular sponge
that is not the size of Texas but I
personally like that it gets my
foundation on so quickly I get a lot of
Daisy hairs on it for some reason going
to use the tip of this to put this
foundation all over my skin all the
products I'm using today work so well
together there's just like all melt in
there seamless they literally look
perfect and we're just gonna press it in
this foundation that does look good with
a brush or with a sponge I like either
way but personally I feel like I'm a
sponge person because I just love the
feeling of the cool sponge like pouncing
on my face it kind of feels like I'm
pushing a pillow on my skin I don't know
it just feels really nice and I just
enjoy using a sponge but if you want to
use a brush this foundation does look
good with that as well it's a little bit
light but this will kind of oxidize to
the color that I am on my body I am
self-tanning I actually have loving tan
and ultra dark on you can see how well
that covers it really does minimize the
look of your pores
since I have rosy
I do have a lot of texture and I do have
larger pores as well I used to like be
super self-conscious about my pores but
I noticed since I really started taking
care of my skin like a few years ago my
pores have changed completely you know
washing off my makeup every night I've
noticed the biggest difference with
first off my skincare as long as I'm
sticking to my skincare regimen my skin
will be fine my pores will be smaller
and also just focusing on what products
work best for you if a foundation
doesn't look good on your pores that's
totally fine or turn it do whatever and
there's a different foundation out there
that's gonna look better on your skin so
just because something enlarges your
pores doesn't mean it's the end of the
world you know what I mean sometimes I
used to feel like that like ah she has
like perfect skin and no pores how does
that happen and trust me you'll find
that perfect product for you and I feel
like this product is that for me like a
nine to ten dollar foundation that's
crazy so you can see how it looks on my
skin it's just very smooth and pretty
and it covers so well and with this
sponge it's just like a magic wand takes
no time at all it looks so good I don't
even have any powder on and it just
looks smooth flawless now I'm going in
with a flower beauty light illusion
concealer this one's in the shade light
if I want something a little bit darker
not so highlighted I will go for
light/medium but this is my full
coverage glam not playing any games
makeup this is what the concealer looks
like I absolutely love this one because
it's very smooth like the application is
such a great process glides over your
cheek and blends really well gives you
amazing coverage this is like probably
my ultimate I'm looking at my drugstore
concealers now this is probably my
favorite drugstore concealer ever so it
does have a doe foot applicator and it
kind of has a little bit of an angle to
it and it's nice because when you're
applying it it just smooths on like that
now you could stop here but I do like a
little more concealer this is just what
I do with all my concealers I really
make sure I bring it down over my cheeks
a little bit if you don't have a lot of
redness in the cheek area you don't
really have to do
unless you want to highlight the skin
but I just do that to make sure I have
full complete coverage throughout the
day and nothing kind of wears off I have
done this for such a long time like if I
double layer my cheek area because it is
so pigmented and red it just really
helps with my makeup lasting a little
bit longer on my cheeks and absolutely
no redness peeking through which is what
I like that's why I just drag it down
quite a bit more I also bring it into
the inner corner I don't think it I
don't think any of my eyebrow like that
just happened but I take it in my inner
corners because I'm really dark in that
area and then I go down my nose to help
highlight and contour this take some of
my forehead Cupid's bow and my chin
again this is just how much concealer I
like you can alter it to whatever you
need taking that same sponge I'm going
to blend out this concealer I just like
to pinch it and then go in and tap it
out this concealer and foundation combo
something about the two because the
concealer does have more of a matte
finish even though it's called light
illusion concealer it really does have a
nice like satin matte finish but the two
mix so well together and they look so
gorgeous on the skin it's like a match
made in heaven with these two you just
want to really press that in and blend
out those edges of that concealer just
so it's highlighted but there's not like
a super intense line on your cheek and
then I do like to go in on my lids now
if I'm doing a shadow I won't put
concealer on my lid but since I'm not
doing a lot of eyeshadow today I am
doing that just because I also have
really oily eyelid so don't be afraid
just to sit there and work with your
makeup to make sure everything is
completely blended out you don't want to
go out with any harsh lines of course
nobody does I really do take my time
because a I enjoyed the foundation
concealer process I think it's one my
favorite parts of makeup but you also
just want to make sure there's not like
a spot that you completely missed and
what this funds you ain't gonna miss
nothing but you never know as I
mentioned before you definitely don't
want to bake with this concealer I have
found that it does kind of break up when
you go to justo
the powder that might just be because
I'm oily I don't know for me it didn't
work to bake with this concealer so all
I do is I just press my powder into the
concealer and don't worry about baking
or anything like that favorite powder of
the moment is the makeup revolution
luxury baking a powder lace this does
have more of a banana tint to it which I
like it's not going to look rocky on
your skin it's gonna just highlight that
face and set everything beautifully I
love this powder from the drugstore I
think it's fantastic so definitely check
this out if you're into kind of yellow
toned powders if you've been trying
loose powders that are like white or
colorless I would definitely try out the
light banana kind of colors because they
will blow your mind you'll be like where
have I been this honestly just helps
brighten it looks amazing on the skin
and it doesn't cause any flashback
anything like that I haven't used a
colorless powder and so long even one of
my favorites this is a two-faced peach
perfect mattifying loose setting powder
this is one of my favorite high-end
powders ever but even this one has like
a slight peachy tint to it and it just
makes the biggest difference in the
world
highly recommend trying out powders with
tints to kind of help with any flashback
looking chunky underneath the eye it
makes the biggest difference in the
world now they're really great powder
that has kind of a yellow tint that is I
think a little bit more affordable than
the makeup revolution is the la girl pro
powder this is the HD High Definition
powder in banana yellow so this also
kind of goes along with this foundation
as well and they work really well
together this is another great product
to try you can get it at Ulta you can
get most these products at Alltech
that's where I shop miss the time I have
to make sure my mic is on the last time
I film this my mic went out it was like
oh my god
I was very upset okay so I'm just gonna
use this pixie brush I normally like to
use a morphe eg6 but I can't find it
right now so I'm just gonna use this one
they kind of have the same shape where
they're like that kind of kabuki style
brush but they still have a lot of
movement so I'm just gonna use this one
since I can't find my morphe one right
now
and I'll just take the powder and really
press it into that under-eye area
I'm getting as close to that lower lash
line as possible so we can really set
that concealer and that way it won't go
into any fine lines I also take it on my
lids even though I'm not going to put
any
like crazy eyeshadow on my lids I do
like to set it with powder just cuz like
I said they get very oily and then I
just got over my face like whatever is
left like right underneath my cheekbones
all of that with powder I don't need a
lot of powder for this I just need to
like set the product I never not set my
foundation I've just I've never found
that that works for me no matter how
matte foundation is I always have to set
it or I'm going to be a mess I have to
set my makeup because I just get so oily
and that way when I said it just helps
prevent anything kind of moving later on
in the day if you have like dry skin or
normal you could probably get away with
not setting this foundation because it
does have that like satin matte finish
and some people don't need powder
another loose powder that's really great
also it's just sitting right here I'm
surprised at how big this is that I
missed it this is the chunky its
packaging ever but powder is great I
promise that this is the flower beauty
loose powder in ello one do not get the
what is it like translucent one oh my
gosh flashback crazy even without flash
like you sit there and you're looking at
your skin and you can just see where you
put the powder this one is good this
one's in the shade ello one so like I
said this one does have a tint I'm kind
of like almost out of it as you guys can
see I took the sifter out because that's
just who I am I really love this powder
again it does give you a really smooth
finish and it just looks really great on
the skin so definitely check that one
out too I know you can get it at Walmart
now what we're gonna do is put some
bronzer on I have a few different
favorite bronzers right now I am using
this Catrice Sun glow matte bronzing
powder in the shade medium bronze brush
I'm using was from a Sonia Kashuk set
and I don't know if they have it anymore
because they did revamp Sonia Kashuk so
probably not but I'm sure you can find
something similar it's like a little
dome brush I love this for bronzing the
face I love this it's just a nice warm
toned bronzer really gives you that
sunkissed look makes you look like you
went to the beach it came back and
you're just so brawn love it so this is
what I'm going to be using it's very
pigmented as well so I just tap off any
excess and then I take my bronzer right
on my cheeks and circular motions
and then I just bring it up to my
forehead just like that like look at the
difference between this side and this
side
I love bronzer I could have just bronzer
and go without blush like because
sometimes I use my bronzer as a blush if
it came down to blush or bronzer I would
totally do bronzer so again I'm just
doing circular motions here on my cheeks
and then I'm gonna take it up towards my
forehead this is just how I like to
bronze this is what it looks like with
all the bronzer on I'm just gonna take a
little bit down my neck just to match
everything then I just like to going
with any sibling brush I love a Mac
stippling brush this one is 1 8 7 s but
then I also love this one from Isabel
Scott this is actually a t.j.maxx brush
set I got it out of that and it's really
soft so I'll just kind of go over my
bronzer and make sure all those edges
are blended and we're not looking crazy
you know what I mean because sometimes I
can get a little crazy with bronzer and
blush and highlight so I just have to go
in and really blend it out okay now it's
time to contour I really love the
Catrice prime and find professional
contouring palette I don't really ever
use this but I do use this contour shade
because it is more ashy so I will be
using this today
another just all-over bronzer that's
really good is the covergirl trublend
bronzer and this one's in number 200
bronze I like this a lot to get a
gorgeous warm glow to the skin if you're
wanting a little bit of shimmer in there
and then another bronzer that is great
is the Physicians Formula butter bronzer
this one just smelled this one just
smells like so good sometimes I need my
bronzers a little bit darker than this
so that's why I haven't been using it as
much lately but it is a really great
formula blends really well and it's
really smooth on the skin and it smells
so good like every time I open the
drawer with this in it all you do is
smell like coconut amazingness it's
amazing then the last one I want to
mention is this Catrice cosmetics it's
called the professional makeup
techniques face palette so you have a
little bit of everything in here you
have things to say your under eye with
contour with blush highlight so I
actually did a video showing you guys
how I use this so I will link it down
below or in a card over here but I
really like this palette - it's great if
you want kind of like an all-in-one
palette so I guess I'm gonna be taking
the Catrice prime and fine contouring
palette this one's in the show
a warm harmony and I'm gonna be taking
the contour shade and contouring
underneath my cheekbones I'm gonna use
this little wet and wild brush this is
number P six five and it just looks like
a little dome I'm just going to contour
right underneath my cheeks this is very
pigmented so just keep that in mind and
it just really carves out that cheekbone
but I need to get that foundation off my
lips why you guys tell me and then I
like to take my contour underneath my
bottom lip and I just kind of go like in
the same shape as my chin so I'll kind
of just go like this and shape
underneath it to make that lip look a
little bit powdery and then of course
underneath my jaw I'm always trying to
make my jaw look a little bit thinner or
sharper but I could talk about blush all
day long I am not picky when it comes to
blush I will use the most affordable
blush to the highest of high-end blushes
I love Palladio matte blushes these are
absolutely amazing I will say I'm more
of a matte blush kind of person because
I do have texture and pores and I like
to be my blush here too on the apples of
my cheeks so that's why I love a lot of
Plautius blushes they're very pigmented
the packaging is so sleek and pretty
really great products and then I love
this essence blush place sculpting blush
palette as well this is a highlighter I
never really use it but I do love mixing
these two together for a really gorgeous
like rosy coral glow I'm going to be
using the essence one and I'm gonna mix
these two together
koke has really great blushes as well
and coquÃ­'s at Walmart so I'm just going
to put this on the apples so I take the
very tip of that brush and kind of get
it right here on the apple of my cheek
and then just push back I'm that person
who puts on a lot of blush at first and
then I'll go in and blend it out and
most of the time the blushes will blend
out sometimes you have those little
finicky ones that don't want to blend
out and then you're like oh I'm screwed
but for the most part they all blend out
I just take a nice duo fiber brush and
go in and I do circular motions to
really blend it out and that way it just
gives you a pretty flush of color but
yeah I I'm fully aware that I do too
much blush sometimes but I've
I don't know it's just something about
blush I just love it highlighters from
the drugstore we can talk about this all
day long I have quite a few favorites
I'm gonna show you for my favorites for
the moment first I'm gonna talk about is
this one from Milani this is the stellar
lights rose below every single shade in
here is so beautiful they do have a
little bit of shimmer in there so just
be warned if you have a lot of texture
in your cheeks this does have some
shimmer so it will make it a little bit
more emphasized but I do feel like once
you blend it out it kind of like melts
into the skin and looks really beautiful
and it's nothing too crazy if you want a
wet intense looking highlighter this is
the way to go it is absolutely stunning
think the packaging is beautiful
everything about this is just a plus
this one doesn't have shimmer it's just
very smooth and creamy and it is
blinding the littlest amount of this
highlighter palette goes a long way this
is from flower beauty and it is the
shimmer and strobe highlighting palette
it is beautiful you have really really
great colors in here they are very
intense
I love this palette it did come with a
brush but I don't know where it is this
one it is very slim compact great to
travel way I also really love this la
girl strobe light strobing powder so
this might be the most affordable in
this collection I'm sharing with you
this one's really gorgeous as well it's
in the shade 50 watt looking at it it
looks a little intimidating because it
looks a little ashy but once you put it
on your skin just gives you a really
pretty golden glow and it doesn't have
any shimmer in there it's just a really
pretty shame but if your more fair this
probably would turn a little bit gray on
you so I wouldn't recommend it so I have
a hard time going back and forth with
the Milani one and this next one I'm
about to share with you because I love
both so much but I am gonna use this one
today and it is the makeup revolution so
X highlighter palette this is a
collaboration with a youtuber which i
think is amazing and these powders are
phenomenal this is what they look like
you kind of see the different formulas
and here these are definitely like super
metallic and very wet looking something
to really amp up these three shades but
also these three shades are intense like
your high is crazy news is it is so
beautiful they blend really well they
don't accentuate texture and they give
you like if you have texture but you
want
highlight this palette is honestly the
way to go because it just looks gorgeous
on the skin I can't say enough good
things about it I think it's phenomenal
so I'm gonna be using in this Milani all
over a blending brush this is very
similar to the Anasazi i-83 brush
they're highlighting one and I'm just
gonna mix these two first and then I'm
gonna take it on my cheek and bring it
down quite a bit and then also a little
bit above my brow but not a ton so
that's what that looks like it's so
pretty these are very very smooth so if
you do have texture and you want to
bring your highlight a little bit more
forward these are definitely the shades
to go to because they're not gonna be
like BAM intense on your texture you
know what I'm saying I'm laying this
down my cheek I mean you can even see
how intense that highlight is but we're
about to amp it up also I do like to go
in and just do circular motions on my
cheek to diffuse any line that we might
have but that is what that looks like so
if you're looking for something not so
intense like I'm about to do this
highlight palette can do pretty much
anything for you now I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna go into this shade right
here and I'm going to put this like
right in the center for that pop I mean
these today there's just something about
this that I cannot get away from like I
just think it is so beautiful and then I
do like to take my finger and put some
on my nose I don't normally like to go
all the way to this if my nose I hate
highlighting the tip of my nose like all
right in here just something about it I
can't stand but I will take some of that
highlighter and put it like right in the
center of the nose like that but I don't
bring it down right here and just rub a
circle there it doesn't look good on me
my nose is kind of thick right here so I
don't like to do that so this is what
the foundation concealer blush highlight
all looks like these are all drugstore
makeup products okay so what I'm gonna
do now is I'm gonna finish up the rest
of my face makeup and then I'll be back
to wrap this video up for you guys okay
guys so I am all done with my makeup I
just added a winged liner lashes these
are the Lily lashes and meet Miami and
yeah that is my completed look full
foundation routine all drugstore
products I'm so happy with these
products I think they're amazing highly
recommend you guys checking them out I
will definitely list all of them down
below I hope you guys enjoyed this video

will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
