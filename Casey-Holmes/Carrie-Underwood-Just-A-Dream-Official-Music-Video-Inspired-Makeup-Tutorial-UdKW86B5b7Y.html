tutorial inspired by Carrie Underwood's
just a dream video this is the part
where she was in the white wedding dress
and I just fell in love with her makeup
so I decided to try and recreate it so
if you're interested in seeing how I got
this look then just keep watching first
thing I'm gonna do is apply a Paint Pot
this is a Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
this is really great at priming our eyes
and I like it because it's lighter than
my skin tone so it creates a really nice
base for the shadows then I'm going to
take this free palette and the white
cream color that it has I'm going to use
a flat shader brush and I'm going to
apply it on my lid up to my brow bone
and I'm really gonna pack this color on
my lid
then I'm going to take this color from
Jamaica catwalk I get pad that you can
get at Target with a pencil brush and
I'm really going to focus this right
above my crease and I'm going to take it
all the way to my inner corner
if you're interested all products will
be listed in the downbar so again I'm
really focused this on the upper part of
my crease I don't want to get this color
all my lids because she has that lid
color really really nice and creamy and
white so we don't want to really put
that down there
then I'm gonna take sort of a pointed
fluffy brush and I'm gonna blend out
that line just so it's not super duper
harsh and I'm just kind of repeating the
process now I'm going to take that same
cream color and I'm going to apply this
on my lid because I felt like I got a
little too much purple color on my lid
at that point again just blending out
that line
now I'm going to take some liquid liners
to the Kat Von D autographed liner and
I'm just going to line my top lashline
this doesn't have to be perfect because
I'm going to put some false lashes on
also going to take this L'Oreal hip
liner and I'm gonna put in my inner
corner and on the outer corner I'm gonna
take these Katy Perry lashes and I'm
honey and this Revlon lash glue and I'm
gonna apply my lashes then I'm gonna
take that cut blondie autograph liner
again and I'm gonna go ahead and just go
over the lash band and in this video
Carrie Underwood's liner and lashes are
just super super thick so that's what
I'm trying to recreate here by going
over the lash band and kind of a little
bit more above as well just to get that
really nice thick liner then I'm going
to take this pencil and I'm going to
apply this on my outer portion of my
waterline you don't want to bring this
all the way in it helps keep your eyes
nice and big then I'm going to take the
matte black from the gray palette with
an angled brush and I'm going to kind of
create a wing it's not like super winged
down or anything like that but you can
tell in the video she has a lot more
black eyeshadow right here in a wing
form so that's what I decided to do I
just kind of pack this color on until
I'm satisfied with it and I like doing
this instead of using the liner because
it's less harsh
I'm also going to put some that black
shadow on the bottom water or a bum lash
line where I put that um Oriol hip liner
then I'm taking this estee lauder
sumptuous extreme mascara I'm just going
to put this on to blend my real lashes
with my fake ones
then I'm going to take that cream color
and highlight right underneath my brow
bone this is it so far
hope you guys liked it I also forgot to
put mascara on my bottom water or my
bottom lashes though this the covergirl
LashBlast now Kerry doesn't have really
a color on her cheeks in this video it's
pretty much just like a bronze color so
I decided to recreate that with this
matte bronzer and soft sand it's nice
and light not too harsh which is kind of
what Kerry has in the video then for
lips she has a very peachy nude lip so I
tried to recreate that with this Revlon
lip stick and soft nude then this lip
gloss is from rue 21 I don't know the
name but it's definitely a peachy nude
color so that's it I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial like this video if
you liked it I would love your support
and I will see you all in my next video
