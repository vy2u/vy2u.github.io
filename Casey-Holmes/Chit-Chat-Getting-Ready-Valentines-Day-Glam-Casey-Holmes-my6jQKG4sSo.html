to do a chit chat get ready with me so
we're going to do this book right here
this is like one of my Valentines Day
looks just because I didn't want to do
something super red or didn't want
anything pink and want to read lips I
want to do something all that different
something that's a little bit so trick
and if you're not comfortable wearing a
bright red lip or a hot pink lip or
something like that then you could wear
this was out there like you'll love it
because sexy its sultry I think the
white on the waterline just really adds
something extra to this look I think
it's really sexy I like it i love the
glossy lips and i really like this book
so i hope you guys enjoy it as well
don't forget to give a thumbs up and
subscribe i will have a link down below
in a description box there's also a
little button cuz i my name that says
subscribe so you should subscribe you so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this video and let's get started with
have to get this makeup woman in this
video we're going to use some old
goodies some new goodies I'm going to
tell you about some things I don't like
and I'm going to try a new technique
today
wish me luck we're doing foundation
first this never happens I'm going to
try the whole baking underneath here I
do have a pigment on using today and
some darker shadows so hopefully it
doesn't ruin my makeup but we're going
to try this technique and see how what
works out so I am going to prime with my
regular primers I have the Smashbox
primer water if you watch my snapchat
the other day I tried new makeup mainly
the one thing that like it made the
whole face makeup go wrong and I had to
completely take everything off was this
effect a soft light blurring powder
clearly when I put on my face you could
just feel oxidized like immediately it
was crazy it just looks cakey on my skin
it was terrible it's not good to bake
with and when you go to like wipe it
away it just it like sticks to that one
area and doesn't want to blend out very
well so not necessarily good baking
powder in my opinion and I also tried
the milk makeup blurring stick but I'm
going to save my opinions on that for
where it tends to do because we're going
to do a wear test on that I'm going to
go ahead and go in with my cane and
Austin and mattifying primer we should
put this more in the my t-zone this
blurs out your pores okay okay so
there's that now we're going to do the
foundation first thing and I'm going to
the clinic beyond protecting foundation
and concealer and they wanted to work
with me to incorporate this into the
video and I was like oh yeah I was
actually watching a video that somebody
did call Tatum and you buy it
I've been watching those lately if you
put one up but probably looked at it but
she was talking about like things that I
used to use and I don't really show
anymore and then II want to go out and
like get those products again and try
them out like go in my drawers in the
other room which I never go to anymore
and this is one of those products that I
really love back in the day and then I
just got distracted with all these new
products you know so when they reached
out to me I was like perfect times
because I was literally about to go and
mess with some old Lake up that I love
this is a great foundation I love it it
lasts for a really long time it does not
accentuate pores blends out really well
it doesn't dry very quickly which is
awesome you could take your time to
blend this out and you can also use it
as a foundation and concealer which is
what I'm going to show you guys today
I've tried this a couple different ways
one way that I tried it I put my darkest
foundation all over and then use this
kind of like as my shape tape because it
kind of has a wand so it kind of gives
me that vibe I've been loving instead is
to put the darker foundation on the
outer parts of my face and the lighter
ones where I want to conceal and
highlight we're going to use these two
so I have the shade golden neutral and I
also have the shade v fair this is like
my shade that I always was even back in
the day when I was using this I love it
you could see like like some of my
foundation like it's going down quite a
bit fake uses all the time and I'm first
going to go in with golden neutral this
is probably going to be a little too
dark for me right now
but we're just going to work with it
this was a skater look light dance I
really love this color for right when I
still stand and like I said I'm taking
number five fair and putting this like I
names my eyes down my nose literally
like a concealer and you'll see when we
blow this out what I did here there are
twenty dollars let me see how much it is
I forget 20 shades and they're $27 so if
you don't really like splurge on it I
love those a clean counter because
they'll give you a sample that'll last
you for seven days so you don't have to
buy it right away if you just want to
test it out on some take this
go out here so what have you guys been
up to I want to know feel like I've been
a weird mood but I finally figured out
what it was yesterday
I'm not to start that's what it is I
become a whole nother person when I
started patience is like a negative 25
oh I figured out that was what my
problem husband because I was wondering
all weekend I was in a weird mood I
figured it was like because Davis left
off writing again and then I started
craving really bad yesterday in like the
way I work is I get in a funk literally
the week before and the week of so I
just kind of knew I was like okay you
know this is I'm not crazy I'm not crazy
it's just that time in the month the
next I'm going to cream contour I'm
using my favorite contour was the
cushion contour and it's by wet and wild
in the shade cafe loosely and I just
really like this as a base for my
contour I think it's also I also use
this in my Instagram realize vs.
Instagram makeup and I showed you how to
use it in my like real life and not have
to put a contour powder on top can I use
this I mean I brush get a lid in here
gonna lightly contour the cheeks you
check that perfect shade for me I really
like it and I want to do this before I
put powder on because otherwise this
would not blend very well you know what
I mean
like any cream want any cream products
you need to put on before any powder and
then I'm not using the better powders
but I will use the flower Biddy powder
and lo1 I really like this powder a lot
this is not be translucent matte powder
this is the shade lo1 welcome are you
having to take the sifter out because
I'm already like getting close to being
done with it it's crazy I'm going to
bake extra underneath my eyes so that
way hopefully any fallout just is on
there I'm going to do more of a darker
smokey eye today
ooh too much pattern say I'm going to do
more of like a darker smokey eye today
I'm going to use this NARS eyeshadow
primer and today we're using the persona
identity palette and it's actually
created by a youtuber / blogger it's a
really really pretty collie I used this
in one of my videos I had a really deep
smoky eye on with it but it has really
great Basics in here and that's
I'm going to use today so first I'm
going to take is this one right here
which is humble and I'm going to set
that primer you can also use whatever
face power you just used if you wanted
to so my hairstylist found this person
that does micro bleeding like eyebrows
in Atlanta if she's put like the best
and I'm really thinking about it I'm so
scared to do it I don't know if you've
ever had your eyebrows micro bladed let
me know like I'm scared to do it I don't
know if eyes like want to commit but she
does a really good job gonna take the
shade charming I'm gonna put this into
my crease mandu is kind of like a basic
look like a basic smoky eye look on the
corners and stuff but we're going to use
a pigment on the inner part of the eye I
know a lot of you are really anxious for
my collab to be announced like what it
is with Smashbox and I am dying to tell
you have a meeting with them this Friday
you guys will know sooner than later
February is a month to look out for soon
I also have the meet updates confirmed
while I'm staying is out worked hard for
you guys ok I worked hard to get this
done for you for some of you that's been
requesting it I worked hard to make sure
we could do it
Ellen LC really soon I cannot wait I'm
hopefully I'll get in trouble a message
I will now I'm going to take is a shade
maverick this one right here where you
taking the basic shades out of here
sighs what's going to pop is the pigment
we're going to use and I'm just going to
put this in the outer V I'm going to
work this in my crease now when I was
thinking of Valentine's Day makeup I
feel like every year I've done a red lip
look I also did one not too long ago
like for the holidays if you want to
check it out I'll leave it down below
really really liked it now I'm going to
go in with fearless which is the deepest
brown in the palette with that same
brush I'm going to do that same thing
deepen it up right here so I'm not going
all the way in the crease I'm just
keeping it right here on the outer edge
and to get more about halfway this
powder is going to come in handy like
we're going to figure this out whenever
um this palette is really really pretty
I love it so much
okay now I'm going to do is take my
favorite product or my favorite product
and if that is the Too Faced glitter
glue I love this for glitter loose to
mess anything like that
you just really keep everything on your
lid I'm going to take the mac 242 doing
this directly wherever I want that
pigment to go so I go a little bit above
my crease and then about halfway onto my
lid all the way in the inner corner and
then I immediately go in with whatever
pigment I'm using because this does dry
fairly quickly I'm taking the LeBrons
artist Couture collaboration which
jackie ina did with artists couture and
it is beautiful it's like a rose gold
which I think it's perfect for
Valentine's Day it's just stunning it's
really pretty as a highlight for deeper
skin tones I've seen her use it so many
times it looks stunning so I mean you
can also use it as eyeshadow and I love
it it is I mean the gold really catches
on the light it's just it's just
beautiful I didn't want to love my
crease that way when I'm looking at you
you can kind of see it I'm going to same
exact thing on the other side I don't
know if this is still in stock II think
she sold out she was selling out like
crazy so if not just use any any kind of
rose gold eyeshadow a pinky gold shadow
and you'll get that same effect and I
find that this Mac 242 is by far the
best thing the pack on color with like
honestly it's so good then I'm going to
go in with that eye shadow brush we used
and just blend the edges make sure
everything kind of goes seamlessly
together now I'm going to take this Mac
chubby marker what is this called the
rapid black pen ultimate eyeliner I
don't know it's a gotelli black eyeliner
marker usually I'm not about this wise
but I actually really like this and I
use this other day I thought it was
really easy to work with and it's super
black so I'm going to line my eyes
really quickly I'm not going to do a
wings line or anything I'm just going to
put some liner
on that upper lashline so I'm gonna have
some things remodeled in my house
hopefully have a meeting on Sunday with
someone I'm like nervous I've never like
remodeled anything but my master bath
seriously needs it and if you follow me
I vlog family time in a little bit more
about my life but Davis and I are
possibly moving to Fort Drum in may I
say possibly because move times really
do change with the military but we are
going to move to Fort Drum at some point
can decide if I wanted to keep this
house or not I could not decide the one
to rent it out or not and I finally come
to the conclusion I'm going to keep it
I'm going to keep this as like an
investment property yeah I'm keeping it
and I'm like you know what I want to
remodel this stuff because what if one
day I come back I want to stay here like
a data server deploy something I
probably come back and live here for a
little bit just depending on the
timeframe that's how long we would have
lived in New York but I figured out like
you know I'll just keep it just keep it
as minimal house run it out
I don't want to keep it as like a
super-intense rental property just yet
like I'm not I'm not there yet
and you know how some people can ruin
houses when they rent them I'm going to
Renault it and kind of make it how I
would want it to be and invest a little
bit into it that way it will pay off
later down the road so I'll have to do
it then I'm really excited I'm so
excited you should I should follow my
blog channel if I end up doing it I will
definitely be blogging it you'll see you
like the transformation with them
because I went to my kitchen to like
granite countertops and stuff like that
that's where my money is going so I just
with some blue on these lashes these are
the house of lashes starlets and we let
these dry so a little bit we're going to
go ahead and move on to space and I'm
going to take this morphe and five to
eight and just just the way it seems
like it works right it looks like I had
a lot of fallout but now I'm going to
take the Victoria mutator Victoria
Beckham Estee Lauder collab I don't even
know what happened with this did anybody
else see this launch it's only going to
see anything launch I got this is PR
like forever ago but I really like this
shape for a bronzer I think it's really
nice and I'm going to take this brush
which a lot of you make fun of you and I
use this with a new to Dena bronzer
the Tom Ford bridge I know it's
expensive but it's the best bronzer
brush ever and then I need to go pick up
that Neutrogena bronzer again because I
hit major pan on it and then it cracked
so I've been having to use other things
but just don't compare so I really need
to go pick that up but it seems to me
making fun of me using my like six
dollar bronzer with this ridiculously
expensive brush but this is because of a
high-end hole okay I really like this
bronzer cuz it's not too intense just
give that a nice warm effect to your
skin now I'm going to take the essence
to shape your face palette use the
bronzer in here I'm going to do that
light contour over where we did the
cream contour today and then for blush
I'm going to use this Marc Jacobs one
just called lines and last night and
then I had a question um may I ask what
blush brush I use I always use a sigma
large and go to contour brush for blush
brush because fluffy it's awesome for
blush and I'm going to highlight with it
I'll highlight it with this other day
and I really liked it it looks really
beautiful so you take my favorite
highlighting brush this is the Sephora
Pro contour 79 so good I love this for
highlighter I'm just going to draw don't
worry it one dot promise I did this the
other day so nice out
okay now let that glue dry so I'm going
to go do my brows real quick I'm using
the benefit Cobra and number three and
then I'll be back to finish off this
makeup look looking a little bit more
normal now I'm going to go back into the
persona palette I'm going to take the
shade sassy which is a nice cream shiny
color so I'm going to apply that oh girl
pigmented now I'm going to take this
nude eyeliner from makeup geek this is
the shade nude I'm going to line my
waterline with this is really going to
help open up the eyes then I'm going to
take a flat brush like this and I'm
going to take the shade fearless which
is a really deep brown and push this
rise against that lower lash line and
connect it to that outer V so just going
to connect it out here
I also line my upper waterline which I
didn't show you guys because I make
those least space and I do that but I
highly recommend lining your upper
waterline just makes your upper lashes
look really thick and full and if you
have falsies on it kind of just blends
everything a little bit better and then
I'm going to take the shape charming
again with a pencil brush and we're
going to blend this out this dark brown
is so easy to blend out that I mean it
just is awesome it's a really great
color to work with finish off the eyes
I'm going to take the Wet n Wild mega
slam skinny mascara I love this for my
lower lashes you can get right up to the
root with it and it really separates
nicely and it doesn't get clumpy really
like the eyes I think the eyes are so
sexy a little bit and then I'm going to
go in for lips we're going to do
something kind of simple I'm going to
take this lip liner from a what a mile
to call bear to comment this is the gel
lip liner I really like it because you
can fill in your lips really easily it
blends out well and some Japanese it's
kinda like as my base because I'm going
to use a lip gloss today so that way
when your lip gloss wear is all just a
little some color underneath and I
decided to go a glossy wistfulness
because I just feel like the eyes are
really kind of sultry so I wanted a
sultry lip as well and I think glossy
lips are beautiful I just love them so
I'm going to use this from the my carry
collection this is the little Miss
Monroe but you can use any kind of
bronzy
a lipgloss that you have sits on top and
then as that is the makeup look I really
like it something different for
Valentine's Day but still sexy so where
can it realize these lashes - I haven't
news these lashes and so long and they
really like to advance awful look I just
don't know what my hair looks like it
was damp so that's the people who never
do their hair like me okay I need to do
my hair I'm gonna do my hair and then
I'll wrap up this video okay so I forgot
to film an outro but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video don't forget to give
it a thumbs up if you did like it and I
will see you guys on Sunday with a new
video okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
