update slash chit chat video
/pl vauxhall I did a snapchat the other
day when I got home there's actually
Tuesday when I got home and I'll show
you guys some things I got in the mail
from companies and I asked you guys if
you wanted me to do like a hall or
whatever you guys said yes and let's see
swatches and just different things that
are out that are new so I figured I
would do that and also update you guys
on where the hell I have been for the
past couple weeks I did upload a video
last Thursday it was the whisper
challenge with Davis which was so much
fun I loved doing that I wanted to
upload something different on my channel
so I just uploaded that to my main
channel but if you didn't know I was out
of town for about a week and a half it
extended a little bit longer because
Monday this is like my story time for a
minute Monday I actually decided to do a
later flight in the girls like that's
okay because your flights gonna be
delayed anyways and I was like okay
perfect whatever so I made my flight to
six o'clock and I get there and I went
six hours and because my plane kept
getting delayed and then eventually got
canceled so trying to stay in the city
another night which like really suck to
have to spend money on a hotel room and
ish like that and then the next day I
get there for my new flight time than a
booked the previous night and it's the
light again so I did get home till about
7 o'clock on Tuesday and when I go home
that's when I do like all the snapchat
stuff and like showed you guys all this
literally the next morning the last
thing I ate was chick-fil-a this is
depressing this is the depressing part
of the story the last thing I ate was
chick-fil-a at 8 o'clock at night 6:30
the morning comes around and my stomach
is hurting I have never felt such pain
before my life I feel like some I was
just like ripping my intestine out it
was horrible and I was sweaty I almost
passed out I ended up going to the
emergency room because I could not
control myself and honestly it was just
the worst thing ever a doctor actually
ended up saying it was food poisoning
and my intestine was inflamed because we
did do a cash game because the pain was
so unreal and yeah that's basically what
happened and the depressing part of that
story obviously is that I a chick-fil-a
last and now honestly when I smell
chick-fil-a I could
washes which is hurting my southern soul
and just really sad and I'm not happy
about it hopefully I can overcome it
that's where I've been it took me 3 to 4
days to recover from that and sometimes
I still get a little bit nauseous but
it's ok it's not as bad as it was it was
bad for 2 full days and then the rest of
the days were kind of like easing off
and I had like really watched when I ate
but now that I've told you that story of
where I've been and wants to taking me
so long I did do a video yesterday but
you guys will see soon it's a makeup
tutorial by the way this background is
not permanent this is just a temporary
thing I'm going to switch up the
backgrounds of some of my videos I'm
going to go back to the makeup one and
come back to this it just depends I
didn't want a plain background I wanted
something different so I was like oh
with something white and this would just
seem pretty it's actually like my shoes
are back here
it's so drinking the way this is set up
its Miami funny but I figured I would do
this for like makeup tutorials random
videos and then go back to the other
side as well just kind of switching it
up because I asked you what you want to
see different on my channel which I saw
a lot of fitness a lot of lifestyle you
guys always seen that really soon Monday
I actually plan on starting at what I
eat in a day video I plan on doing those
I don't know if I want to do them what's
the week or something like that I don't
know what do you guys think let me know
what you want to see I upload when I
want scheduled I upload on Sundays
Tuesdays and Thursdays sometimes it's
not every day that week but those are my
uploading days why do you set a new
background I was like ok I'll try
something see how you guys like it I
personally am not keen on backgrounds
but if it's what you guys like is what
you like it just seems a little not
personalized to me but I totally get
that it focuses you more on me than like
my surroundings I also had some
furniture taken out of this extra room
so maybe I could set something up there
to have another background we'll just
see how it goes let's just get started
with what I got in the mail I've tried
some things I haven't tried some things
I'm also going to be doing a giveaway
it's going to be an Instagram giveaway
so stay tuned for that Instagram is just
like one of the easiest ways all you're
gonna have to do is follow me and like
this picture right here
and leave a comment in that picture
letting me know what you're most excited
to get because I'm going to be giving
away basically a bag of stuff to one
person because I got all this in the
mail and I was just like I don't need
all this stuff I give so much makeup
away to my friends it's ridiculous like
they have a whole new makeup collection
when I give them stuff cuz I'm like oh
you like this little bit take all this
with you I figured I would give this
stuff away to one of my viewers so yeah
if you want to check again the details
on how to enter this giveaway I will
leave it all down below in the
description box as well as all the
products I will be including in the
giveaway it's not gonna be everything in
this haul but it will be things that I
either have don't need don't want have
no use for things for brunettes I'm not
really gonna be a brunette here much
longer I'm going a little bit lighter
before I leave for spring break the
first thing that I have tried that I
don't like sadly is the Smashbox primer
oil and I got this indicate with all my
favorite primers like the primer water
the pore minimizer those are my
favorites I love them and I always keep
me stocked so thank you Smashbox so much
I really appreciate it
those are mine that's like my combo for
life I'd use it for so long but I tried
this and I have really sensitive skin
and have rosacea if you're new to my
channel and this made my rosacea like
inflamed and it was so red so irritated
it didn't sink into the skin because I
left it on while I did my eye makeup and
it just it was horrible oils don't
usually work on me try josie maran I've
tried multiple different oils and
honestly they just really irritate my
skin and my skin just doesn't like it so
I'm gonna have to give this away to a
friend unless the viewer wants it if you
do want it let me know in that comment
on this picture on my Instagram and let
me know if you do want it I will totally
throw in the box for you I haven't
touched it because it's sanitary all you
do is just twist this and it has a
dropper and you drop it in your fingers
that's all I did so if you want to try
it out let me know in that comment and I
will totally include it in your prize
packet if you win then also some other
things I got her from the brand I think
it's called SIOC day
no they have some new liquid velvet
moisturizing matte liquid lipsticks I
adore these and they're great you can
get them from Sephora which is where
I've seen them I'm not gonna swatch
everything I'm just going to swatch a
couple things that I'm keeping so this
first shade is in the shade Wonderland
which is just a really nice pink if
you're wondering I'm looking over here
is my viewfinder and everything is
showing up true to color so that's kind
of the bonus of the background - I'm not
even gonna lie they're really pigmented
really nice they are very moisturizing
and they are really nice and matte I
love them and the packaging is really
cute this is the cool one this is called
envy like a bluey turquoise color this
is pretty cool this is the shade
Chatterbox which is a gorgeous plummy
purple look at that so this one's in the
shade pinup it looks a little bit
different to me it to me it was supposed
to be more of a darker color and it's
just completely different I don't know
yeah but it's in the shade pinup so I
don't know what it is but I was really
looking forward to this color but it's
not as dark as I've wanted but it's
still very pretty so that is pinup by
the way what I have on my lips right now
is dose of colors desert suede and I
also have my extensions and I'm wearing
foxy locks extensions if you guys are
interested
I love these extensions I just have any
one's for my ombre they're in the shade
mocha toffee I love them I will leave
all the information down below as long
as the code you can use a check out to
get like a little free gift next one is
called kiss me quick this is like a
light pinky coral this one I'll be
giving away as well it's very pretty I
just don't do white peach like this and
then they have the shade fast lane it's
gonna be more of a fiery red this one
I'm going to keep this one's in the
shade budu oh my god how gorgeous I know
my arm looks so pale right now look how
gorgeous this color is so that one is
voodoo oh just got me doing it then this
last shade is head over heels like a
darker hot pink so and then buxom also
sent over some of their lip creams I'm
not gonna swatch these because the
colors are just right here this one is
in the shade tequila sunrise this one's
in the
sangria these are really nice too this
one I'm actually keeping this one is in
the shade peach daiquiri these are more
like a vanilla shade shade these have
more of a vanilla smell I appreciate
that more I like the vanilla smell more
than the mint tea the mentee I felt for
so long on my lips yesterday anyway so
then we have three Purple's left we have
very bramble also have great groove
which is a fun kind of electric purple
pink which is a pink champagne and then
also it cosmetics did spend over their
new mascara this is the superhero
elastic stretch volumizing mascara is
that 96% said lashes look stretched 96
said they saw dramatic volume in length
96 also said saw plumper looking lashes
and 100% said they saw a fuller lash
line so I mean that's some pretty good
claims right there that's almost 100
percent for each claims okay this next
brand is PC a skin I've never tried this
brand before so if you have let me know
I need to read up on it this in a bunch
of like brochure stuff but they sent
over a ton they stood over the
revitalizing mask which this sounds
really good it has like papaya puree
with lemon orange and apple to brighten
up dull complexions and exfoliate and
that also has green tea vitamin E and
honey for moisturizing antioxidants and
yeah it just seems really nice I'm
excited to try it this I'm probably
gonna take with me to the beach this is
the weightless protection broad-spectrum
SPF 45 we also have the revitalizing a
gel cannot wait to try this i love i
jealous jealous again so quickly so
there's my favorite they also sent over
a hydrating serum the intensive
brightening treatment which I've never
used a brightening treatment and then
they also sent a nutrient toner they
also sent over the cleanser oh cool so a
cleanser awesome if you want to try it
up some also distant over this palette
this is the suede seduction eyeshadow
palette it was just a nice all neutral
palette they're all matte so that's
really cool I haven't touched these at
all if you are wondering okay moving on
to new Stila products let's see they sit
some things over this thing I actually
really like this is the Aqua blush serum
concealer they sent over another one and
had actually told them I really love
this because they asked about tried
anything from this collection and this
concealer is a really nice one I highly
recommend it
they also sent over the Aqua glow
foundation I haven't tried this yet I
haven't even seen it in review so I'm
excited to try it
it has really cool packaging I was
playing with that Ulta basically what
you do is you just twist it up like this
and you see this top comes up and this
will come up and it's like a serum so
you just drop it on in there oh they sit
some stay all day liquid lipsticks we
have a shade Riko it looks so similar to
the Beyonce moments just a little bit
lighter so have oh my god I think this
is the one I swatch before I left and I
was like yes this is in caramel oh it's
just a lighter nude but I think it's
really pretty like to mix the different
colors it's just a lighter pinky nude
it's like a horrible way to swatch and
then this shape which is bhakta which
I'm not going to swatch this woman's
going to give this one away this is a
really nice berry color all right now
the exciting part of this is the new
makeup forever stuff I got I've been so
excited to talk about this because I've
actually been using one of them like
crazy I have it on my face right now to
contour and they said over two of these
makeup forever
Pro sculpting sinks palettes so in this
palette you have four different shades
so you have this shape which is a matte
cream to highlight with of course
they're gonna be lighter or darker with
whatever shade you go with for the
palette then you have this matte contour
this iridescent cream which is a
highlight and then they have this color
right here which is a blush color they
said that you just finish by adding this
flush of color to the cheek and you're
good to go
I've been using number 20 they sent over
twenty and thirty twenty was great for
me because I'm not as self tan I think
30 will be great for when I am nice and
tan I really really like the contour
shade I like this one too to mix with
conceal and I didn't have a lot of
concealer to put on my face today for my
lighter face so I just mixed it in this
cream one and it really highlighted and
nicely so so far I like these and I like
how compact they are there
very very nice so they also sent over
these pro sculpting lifts you can add an
ombre lip basically so on one side you
have the color which is not that side
one side you have the color which is
really nice I'm going to swatch this one
real quick this one's the shade number
10 so basically this is just like the
highlighter you can use this to put the
center of your lips Cupid's bow anything
like that to make your lips look plumper
or just add something different to your
lip color so I think that's also and
they sent over in shades 10 this one is
40 this one is 11 which is a great
everyday color and then this one is 50
and then I sent over these Pro sculpting
brows and 20 and 30 they have this fully
end then you have this end with the
slanted tip on it so you can just fill
in your brows it's a little dry I don't
have to try it but you have that and
then you can also take this off and
highlight your brow bone with this so
it's basically like a two in one product
and then I have very quickly show this
is the last thing from Stila this was
the sunrise splendor convertible color
dual lip and cheek palette this is like
a cream palette where lips and cheeks
swear I am spanking-new so very very
pretty great for spring and summer okay
next thing is from bite Beauty I love
bite Beauty so much and I'm guessing
they just came out with a new lipstick
shade they look absolutely gorgeous
these are all the lipsticks in here but
it's mouth-watering citrus flavor its
third they have 34 bold dimensional
shades and they're ultra creamy
hydrating texture made from 12 edible
oils which is really cool okay so this
is in the shade spritzer it's a really
pretty purple color this one I'm excited
about this isn't honeycomb gorgeous it's
like a great everyday nude this is in
the shade Gaza poncho just a nice red
its what I'm excited about as well as in
choice a darker nude right at my
darker news so that is try right there
this one's in black truffle oh I cannot
wait to play with this one I love my
dark colors this is beautiful this is
like a really nice deep color because
it's not sheer like when you first apply
it it's really nice I cannot wait to
play with that and then this one is in
the shade beet root which is again like
another darker berry color do face
distance something over for Valentine's
Day this is what I'm giving away to
because I have so many of these as
backups right now that I need to kind of
get through them but this is one of my
favorite mascaras it's the better than
sex to face mascara and the cutest
little box ever if you're under the age
of 18 I did not cope with his name and
you parentsÃ­ better than sex it was not
me it was two bases so I'm sorry to
blame on them so now I'm going to talk
about one of my new favorite lash brands
that I'm obsessed with
I found her on instagram ordered a
couple pairs and I guess she found out
who I was and was like I'm gonna send
you some more stuff and I was like thank
you so much it's so exciting cuz I did
purchase a couple myself and then she'd
gifted me the rest of the stuff to try
it out so thank you so much I really
appreciate it the brand is aleena lashes
this is one of these that she sent to me
it's the fabulous system city set I'm
wearing ones right now from the air and
they're in the shade G in the shade
they're in the style GG they're very
dramatic they're very long as you can
see right here they're intense and I
love them now I don't know which lashes
are which here are some of the lashes
they are beautiful they're really full
and just absolutely stunning so these
are named after the Kardashians or some
of them so I feel like I'm going to love
Khloe right here because they're really
full but even the other ones unlike
natural days are gonna be stunning so
this is from her Coco collection we have
these styles Bella
Jaclyn Maya and Tia and then she sent
over some of her matte lipsticks which
is really exciting I didn't know she had
these like I did I guess I didn't
explore the I website much but they come
in this really cute package I mean it's
pretty glam
and then they pop out like this
I think she sent me a couple shades -
this doesn't have the shades on them
oh no and they're smudged on the back
I'll try to find them and let you guys
know but this one's like a deep berry
color then we have a light pink color
and we also have ooh really pretty kind
of nudie mom I love this color can
already tell I'll figure out what color
this one is too and I'll leave it down
below it's definitely a mauve but like a
mommy news and then we have more of a
lighter kind of nude lighter color than
that I think no it is the same color
okay I think she gave me two of each
color so I'm not gonna swatch this one
this was exciting because Estee Lauder
has never sent me anything anyways these
are the things that I got they sent over
two glosses and a Oh plump and fill lip
treatment that's siding so this is their
pump and fill lip treatment I don't know
what this is but guys sounds awesome
plumper on one side and the filler on
the other it's like a plastic surgeon's
office all in one tube and they sent
over to Colossus so they sent over very
provocative and passion passionate
fuchsia ooh those are provocative names
so this one's more of like a shimmery
berry color and then this one's
passionate fuchsia and this is just a
sparkly hot pink color then this other
package they sent over it's just like
little goodie bags and this is the F
Sailor oh I love their eye creams and
like I serums I live for them so this is
the filmed the new dimension firm and
fill I serum oh my god I cannot wait
different tubes okay that gives me life
and then this is the sumptuous knockout
defining lift and fan mascara and black
Estee Lauder and Lancome really come out
with some great mascaras I think they're
very underrated so I can't wait to try
this out best thing I got was actually
from John Frieda and whoever wins this
is pretty much gonna get all the
stuff because it's all for room next and
I'm becoming more blonder on the ends so
I can't really use it but this is the
john frieda brilliant burnett visibly
deeper color deepening treatment color
deepening conditioner so it just
intensifies your color so there's no ver
that conditioner
they also stayed over that shampoo of
total lightening conditioner oh I might
keep this one for oh it says it lightens
for sunkissed glow that's really cool
y'all remember these spray stuff that
what was it Sun in oh my god I lived for
that stuff when I was younger the stuff
was horrible for your hair but everybody
used it oh well thank you john frieda I
wish I was still more of like a dark
brunette but this one is the in shower
lightening treatment that's awesome this
it's perfect for summer then the next
thing is this Sephora formula X little
thing they sent over for Valentine's Day
and you just open it up and you have
this little card I'm gonna do at this
side so you have this little card and
then on the inside you get the fixed
nail treatment then you get this really
pretty red polish and then you also get
