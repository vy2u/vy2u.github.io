be a Christmas party hair make up an
outfit look and this video is going to
be a collab with my friend Amanda which
is the beauty box 12:11 I love her
videos she is so sweet and she's
drop-dead gorgeous and very talented so
if you have not subscribed to her
channel I will leave her link down below
so we did a clap for this she did one
look and I did another look so you get
basically two looks in one with this and
I know you guys really love the hair
makeup and outfit looks I'll definitely
be putting these out for you guys as the
week's go on since I am doing a video
every Monday through Friday for December
so there is gonna be one on Monday so
just stay tuned for that but it's the
holiday season and I know a lot of us
are going to some holiday party so we
just decided to give you guys some ideas
for your hair makeup or outfit feel free
to switch it up however you want make it
your own
and yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video don't forget to give it a thumbs
up if you do like it and I will see you
guys in my next video bye okay so the
first thing we're gonna do is prime our
face I'm using the benefit Porefessional
and also the Mac prep and prime the
benefit one just helps with pores and
the Mac one helps to keep my face matte
now moving on to primer I'm using this
NARS primer I absolutely love this and
then I'm going to apply a light layer of
the Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre and I'm
just using this to even out my eyelids
next I'm going to take taupe with the
Sigma e-40 and I'm just going to blend
this all into the crease I'm not really
being precise I'm just buffing it all
over because this is going to be our
transition shade
next I'm taking my Sigma e55 and
spraying it with fix+
and I'm going to go in with the gold and
also the bronze color right next to it
so I'm mixing those two together and I'm
gonna put those all over my lid and when
you wet the brush with the mac fix+ it
really helps the shadow go on really
nice and pigmented and it gives it kind
of a foiled look so it's really really
pretty
next I'm going to take this Sigma e45
and going in with sable
I'm going to deepen my outer half and
also blend this into the crease so just
blend it into the outer corners and into
the crease I say this all the time but
don't worry if you're messy with it if
you do your foundation last it's really
easy to go in and clean up the lines and
make them nice and straight so be as
messy as you want because you can always
clean it up later
okay so now what we're gonna do is take
our e-40 again with no additional
product and just blend out that darker
shade that we just put on just to make
sure that we don't have any harsh lines
now I'm gonna take this Knicks little
crystal aligner and this is in the gold
shade and let me tell you looking at the
footage now it does not look as nice as
it looks in person but after it dries
you'll see here in a couple Clips later
it looks so pretty but you just
basically want to pile this stuff on to
the inner part of your lid all the way
out to the outer half and it's gonna
look really really gorgeous now I'm
taking a concealer this was from my Mac
Pro and concealed palette and I'm just
cleaning up these edges
I'm using the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation let me just say this is like
one of my new favorite foundations I
have the samples but I'm definitely
going to buy the full sizes as soon as
possible and I'm just using this Sigma
brush to blend it out now this color is
a little light for me but we will go in
with bronzer and it will help fix
everything and make it look more even
and blend in with my neck I'm gonna take
my Mac concealers these are the pro
longwear concealer zan NC 20 and 30 I
just mixed both of them and put them
underneath my eyes and blend them out
with the Beauty Blender next I'm taking
my NARS crystal translucent crystal
powder and I'm going to set it with the
f-86 and then also the f30 I'm just
setting all of my face makeup
next I'm taking my Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer in my Sigma F 20 and I'm
going to bronze up the skin and add some
color back in and then I'm gonna take my
NARS eita brush it's called the NARS ITA
brush and I'm just going to give myself
more of a stronger contour so I'm doing
the hollows of my cheeks the tops of my
forehead underneath my jaw on the sides
of my nose and underneath my lip to make
it look a little bit more pouty
now it's time for blush I'm using NARS
orgasm in this clip it looks like only
did the right side but I did do the left
side as well I just cut it out and then
we're gonna go into our brows I've been
using my own estancia brow Wiz I've also
been incorporating my Tarte Amazonian
clay mousse the brow mousse or whatever
I use just outline the brows with the
Anastacio and then fill them in with the
Tarte product and I just really like the
outcome I think it looks really nice and
smooth and really even as well
now I'm going to take the Anasazi a brow
gel in brunette and set my brows this
also helps them look a little bit more
natural since it is a lighter brown gel
and then I'm going to line my waterline
and my top waterline with the Mac eye
Kohl in smolder now I'm going in with my
Maybelline line stiletto in black and
I'm just going to line my upper lash
line I'm going to do a really thin line
just to make sure that you can see that
gold but I'm gonna do a pretty thick
wing and bring it in because I do want
that part to be a little bit more
dramatic but I want to make sure that
line isn't too thick just so you can see
the gold glitter that we put on
taking this black in the Sigma e30 I'm
going to deepen up the outer half again
so you can see I'm just following where
the winged eyeliner ends and bringing it
in a little bit into the crease I'm not
going too far with it I'm just mainly
focusing it on the outer half I like
doing this after I do my eyeliner just
because I feel like it's a nice guy for
me and I don't go too far out or
anything like that so I just find that
it's easiest and then I go in and blend
it with the Sigma e25
now taking this cream shade I'm going to
highlight my brows and then I'm going
back in with that glitter liner and just
applying a little bit more because this
is a dramatic look and we love glitter
right so I'm also taking that glitter
liner and putting it around my tear duct
be very careful not to get this in your
eyeball because it stings so bad now I'm
going in with taupe and I'm just going
to smudge this underneath my lower lash
line to kind of smoke it out a little
bit and then taking my Tarte eyelash
curler a my mascara from Maybelline
which is the rocket going to apply this
and I did not plan on applying false
lashes but near the end I decided I
wanted to so I'm doing it to the top and
bottom and I'm going to fill in my lips
with the Revlon Colorstay lipliner in
nude which is my all-time favorite right
now I think it is so pretty and really
easy to work with
so after I was filming this part it cut
off before I could do the rest of my
lips so I'm gonna show you guys the
lashes I used really quickly I did use
the ardell demi wispies in black and
then for lips I use the Urban Decay
Naked 2 and the Mac lip gloss and Flor
abundance now for my hair I'm going to
be using the new me 25 millimeter one
and we're just going to be alternating
curls so you can see I'm just taking
this curl away from my face and then the
next curl is going to be towards my face
so you can see I'm taking this section
and wrapping it towards the front of my
face and this will just create a lot
more volume and I'm wrapping it around
instead of doing the ribbon effect which
is where you lay it flat and wrap it
around just because it's going to give
you more of a wavy look this way and I
also have special discounts and stuff
for new me for the holiday season so if
you're interested in those I will leave
those discounts down below in the
description box
so after you're done curling your hair
I'm gonna take this larger teasing comb
and just kind of brush out the curls
make them look a little bit more messy
and this is definitely been my go-to
hairstyle for a while now I think it is
so cute I just love the alternating
curls and stuff and so now I'm just
going to kind of mess with it and loosen
it up with my hands flip it over because
I just like messy hair I think it looks
really pretty so you could leave it like
this if you wanted to but you know me
I've been loving pinning my hair to the
side so I'm going to take this section
that I had going away from my face and
I'm gonna pin it right underneath this
section that's going towards my face so
it kind of frames my face in a way I
don't know it looks really really pretty
and I like the way it turned out
so this is the completed hair and makeup
all right for the outfit I just went
with something kind of casual but still
a little bit dressy the top is from H&amp;amp;M
the belt is from a store called no style
the pants are from H&amp;amp;M as well and the
boots I got off of hope look so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video please give
it a thumbs up if you did and I hope you
guys have a great holiday season if
you're going to a party then have fun
and I will see you guys in my next video
bye
