a Q &amp;amp; A it has been so long since I've
done a Q&amp;amp;A I actually filmed one when I
was supposed to go or when I did go out
of town for like that month or whatever
but I never uploaded it just because I
wasn't happy with it you know it just
wasn't like I don't know I just didn't
like it so that's why I didn't upload
that but I figured I would do another
one for you guys today so I asked you
guys ask me questions on Instagram as
she oh my snapchat you know my Instagram
to head over to Instagram and leave a
comment on this picture and let me know
some of your random questions things you
want to know just get to know each other
a little bit better it's been so long
since I've done a Q&amp;amp;A and I've honestly
had so many people ask me why I haven't
done one in a while because people used
to really like them and I love filming
them I think there's so much fun
so I was like you know what let's let's
do a Q&amp;amp;A it'll be fun by the way I am
wearing at my foxy locks extensions in
honey spice ombre and I went lighter
with my hair today and I'm just obsessed
they match perfectly now that I went a
little bit lighter and honestly you guys
these extensions are amazing I think
these are my favorite ones just because
I really love the color I mean this the
same quality they're still really thick
and really soft but I'm just like so
obsessed do you guys want to see where I
get them I'll leave a link down below
and I'll have a little coupon if you
want a free gift with purchase but I get
a lot of questions on my hair and now
that I went lighter I did go lighter
with my extensions and I will say there
are a lot of Davis questions I know some
people kind of get defensive and I kind
of get upset when I answer a lot of
questions about him or a boyfriend in
general but he's a part of my life and
if you don't like it then I'm sorry but
it's a huge part of my life now and a
lot of you guys are happy for me and
curious and I'm going to answer your
questions so I also want to just quickly
say that Roxxxy 99 said what was
something stupid you did when you were
young and that was take my mom's car
when I was 14 I took it at night I snuck
out of the house I took the car and all
the way across the other side of town to
pick up a friend that was also really
underage thank God we didn't get a an
accident on B get caught well I did get
caught later on this a-hole
story that's like my life story it's a
hot mess
I was such a little like not even
gonna lie that was really one of the
worst things I've done I snuck out a lot
when I was younger but taking my mom's
car without her permission in the middle
of the night really was like the
cheering on top of the cake Cortney
Nicole asked what is your favorite junk
food oh my gosh you know lately I've
been really eating a lot of Milk Duds
I don't know why I'm just like having a
craving for them I had a craving for
them the other day ever since then I had
just met feeding them like crazy I have
to restrain from buying them because I
weight the whole box in a day so Milk
Duds definitely and pizza I can tell
them about the star and I'm out I'm like
ready to order a pizza because my excuse
for eating pizza is always when I start
I don't know it's just a good excuse
right that in burritos like the first
day of my period I'm like I want a
burrito and pizza strong girl living as
such your least favorite thing about
being in a military relationship I would
say like not seeing him as much as I
want to and I know even when we end up
living together I probably won't see him
as much as I want to I'll see you more
than than I do now but that's probably
the one thing is like distance and if he
gets deployed or something that's really
going to suck so probably just like
distance and not being around each other
a lot it can be a good thing I feel like
it kind of keeps the spark alive but
then again like when we're together all
the time it's we have a spark as well so
yeah I would just say not being around
each other all the time a lot of you are
asking what Davis and i's plans are
ever since he graduated if you follow my
vlog channel you guys saw him graduating
and like our whole process with that and
right now use that for bending doing
some training and everything like that
he has a while of training to do it I
think it's gonna be about a year or a
little bit less than a year now that he
has to do that for and then we'll go to
Fort Drum he has like Ranger School and
Airborne School to get through and at
the end of that then we'll go up to Fort
Drum so we got a little while from there
I know a lot of you were asking about my
house and like what are you gonna do
with your house you just bought it and
you know I totally agree but when I
bought this house I had a totally
different plan for myself I thought I
was going to be here honestly for the
longest time like at least five to ten
years but you know you meet people and
things change so sometimes you just
to deal with it sell the house hopefully
make some money off of it and go start
somewhere else smell for Stevie I think
it is asked what are the beauty parts
you always have in your purse and that's
so funny because I was doing my makeup
and I had this back right here there's a
couple things that are left out just
because I was using them during the
tutorial but like I always had this
benefit roller lash in there I now keep
this Maybelline better skin in here I
keep this Estee Lauder powder this is a
flash photo powder just like a
translucent powder
I have another benefit roller lash
I keep a duo fiber brush that's really
disgusting and I never use it I keep my
NARS radiant creamy concealer in medium
dark one this is great for if I'm
breaking out I just need to cover up
something even if it's on my body
I always keep this on hand just in case
I have a little bit of redness from like
a breakout coming through I have an
eyelash curler from Sephora I know you
asked what I always keep in it but this
is like all that stays in my makeup bag
I rarely ever change it I have two of
the Smashbox liquid suede lipsticks oh
and a babe alert this is the one I went
through the washer and dryer it survived
somehow and then I also keep dream huge
in here which I kind of look the same
they're just a little bit different this
one's more of like a nude pink and then
the last two things I always keep in
here or three I'm sorry
I have a little eyeshadow brush keep a
Calvin Klein lip pencil in 810 gossip
which is like a darker nude if you can
see it on my forehead and then always
always always have to have my NARS
larger-than-life long wear eyeliner this
is like my favorite eyeliner you guys
know this I've used it for years and I
always have to have it with me Alexandra
be said I know it's months from now but
do you plan to do vlogmas this year say
yes lol I definitely plan on doing
vlogmas vlogmas last year with a lot I
was traveling and spending a lot of time
with Davis cuz at that time we were so
far apart but this year I think I'm
definitely gonna vlog more I was kind of
sad that I didn't go through in the last
year I just kind of stopped halfway but
they share I'm definitely gonna try
Meghan 'evil 2014 at said snapchat BAM
she said what is the most dangerous
thing on your bucket list or have you
already done I guess skydiving
things on my bucket list it's not like I
actually want to do it but I want to do
it just to say I did it you know what
I'm saying I'll never ever bungee jump
or do anything like that that's too
crazy for me because I'm more scared of
like the core just snapping than I am
just falling to the ground I don't know
it's really weird but skydiving
definitely is on my bucket list and I
feel like it's the most daring because
I'm the most terrified of that little
cakes 94s what camera do you use to take
your selfies is it your phone they
always look so good yes it's my phone I
always use my iphone six-plus
and I use the front camera I never use
that camera shout out to the people that
do use that camera because I find it so
difficult I always use the front camera
Allison Rose asks how old were you when
you first moved into your house um that
was I was I was 22 yeah I believe I was
22 years old I can never keep up with
how old I am you guys I don't know if
anybody else's like this but once I turn
a certain age like once I turned 24
automatically thought it was 25 it's
like I'm already aging myself but it's
because I'm preparing my mind for the
next age does anybody else do that
because people ask me I'm like 25 then
I'm like no I'm sorry no no no I'm 24
Lindsey 78s would you rather have a dog
with a cat's personality or a cat with a
dog's personality much rather have a cat
with a dog's personality just because I
love the personality of a dog
they're super interactive always around
just I don't know I love dogs
so I would do the cat with a dog
personality be mote as we you and Davis
be attending any Clemson football games
this year and we were actually going to
the Clemson Auburn game at Auburn and I
am so excited you guys know I love
albarran I'm just I'm so excited
whenever I'm there like at the stadium
just oh I just love Auburn so I'm really
pumped about it as family's going I'm
gonna be the only Auburn fan but we'll
be at my house though it'll be okay I'm
really really excited about it and I'm
hoping that Auburn comes through because
if not then all my shit-talking will
just go down the drain Kayla PN's Leigh
said when are you good when are you
going to have kids and how many do you
want and do you have names picked out we
had talked about kids I forget the names
that
chose thinking two kids and don't know I
definitely wanna be married before I
have kids I want to be married live the
married life for a while and then have
kids
hopefully the plan work out that way um
but if not you know it's fine we just
still want two kids shannon Brockway
said do you plan on having your own
makeup line one day or just collab with
smashbox and a lot of you are asking
when my collab with smashbox is coming
out coming out next summer so we
actually finalized product this week and
I am so excited for you guys to see it I
just cannot wait it's gonna be so hard
to wait till next year I think it's
actually gonna be the beginning of next
year that I'll show sneak peeks but next
year is definitely when it's going to
launch I don't plan on coming out my own
makeup line right now I want to see how
Smashbox goes I know makeup lines are a
lot of work and I don't know I just kind
of see myself like opening a boutique
maybe an online boutique or a boutique
like in a college area and I also see
myself creating a doll line I have
talked about this for a while I just
want my own dog line with like leashes
harness
collars bowls start off with the basics
first and then expand out to like little
costumes or something you know that's
like my ultimate dream so kind of like
going away from makeup it's still like
being girly and creating things and like
letting my creative juices flow so so
Carly say what's a show that you
consider your guilty pleasure to watch I
don't watch a lot of shows you guys know
if you've been watching me for a while
it shows i watch Real Housewives of
everything my TV is always on Bravo but
sometimes I will change that channel to
HGTV and I will watch all the episodes
of fixer-upper and it doesn't help that
my nail salon only shows the HGTV
channel so I'm like glued to it that's
the only way I can stand to get my nose
done is if I'm watching that TV
I love HGTV it's like a sick obsession
but when fixer-upper comes on that's
like my thing I love Joanna and chip and
I'm just like the things they do to
house is I want them to come to mind and
just play black 6096
how do you and Davis trust each other
being so far away from each other all
the time we are together more now that
he's at fort benning but when he was in
New York it's just one of those things
where you have to just trust them and be
honest I trust him if I were to find out
something that worth was negative that
he did I would be completely shocked
honestly no it's just like one of those
things once you find somebody you trust
as long as they don't give you a reason
to not trust them you should trust them
beautiful chil XO said do you ever
daydream about how your wedding dress
would look like yeah I don't know when
that's gonna happen but I do think about
whenever like the day we get married
like what it's gonna be like and I just
I don't know I feel like I'm gonna be
that girl that goes all out honestly
like I'm gonna go all out and somebody's
gonna have to be like Casey calm down
put the checkbook down and calm down but
I picture like a wedding dress that's
just like form-fitting at the waist and
kind of goes out a little bit I don't
know I don't know you have to like try
mom but Pinterest is deadly when it
comes to wedding pins like I'll like
look at all the dresses on there just
because I'm curious and they have some
really cute stuff but Pinterest is good
for everything Katie asked have you
stayed consistent with your diet and how
have you lost weight and been able to
keep up with it um you know I'm saying
about this the other day and I try to
stick with my diet as much as possible
especially since whenever I go a while
on my diet I do I eat as clean as
possible I try not to do any processed
foods or anything like that even though
I love pizza it's hard to stay on the
diet but I noticed when I don't I will
get so nauseous and like sick to my
stomach after eating something bad like
even chick-fil-a makes me sick to my
stomach now if I switch over to that and
like eat fried foods or something
because that's not what I eat a lot at
all that's like a once in a month type
of thing maybe twice so I think that
that kind of helps me stay on track a
little bit I lose weight because I love
working out I love lifting weights it's
like my favorite thing I love to go kill
an hour in the gym and just have fun and
kind of like not worry about anything
other than working out working out is
like one of my favorites
ever and I have a trainer so I have
somebody to talk to when I work out and
it's just fun I think having a trainer
has pushed me to go to the gym more just
because somebody is relying on me to get
my ass to the gym and workout so I think
that helps me get up and go but once I
get there I just I absolutely love it I
think I was like earlier this week or
last
it was elastic I think on snapchat I
asked you guys if I should try the
Cinnabon delights and you guys are like
oh yeah so I went and tried them I was
so sick within a few hours like it was
it felt like I had the worst stomach
virus in the world I thought I was gonna
throw up with like every breath I took
and the next morning I felt fine I had
took like a nausea pill for I went to
bed and I woke up feeling okay like it
wasn't a stomach virus because it only
lasted for a few hours but it was bad I
blame it on the Cinnabon delights and I
hate to say it but I will never eat
those little things again lisa lopes
1997 asks are you working on any other
collaborations besides Smashbox and I am

favorite go-to drink at the bar love you
