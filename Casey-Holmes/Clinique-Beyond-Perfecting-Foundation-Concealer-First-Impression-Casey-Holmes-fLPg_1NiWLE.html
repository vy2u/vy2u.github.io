a first impression for you this is one
where I'm going to go throughout the day
and update you on how the foundation is
wearing so the first impression is going
to be on the clinic beyond perfecting a
foundation and concealer I have the
shade eight golden neutral this might be
a little dark for me but we're going to
make it work because I don't feel like
exchanging it because I know I'm going
to get tan throughout the summer this is
basically supposed to be a foundation
and a concealer in one and let's let's
look at some claims they don't have any
claims on the Box everybody kind of has
a four four and a half review on this
foundation says it's an oil-free
foundation and concealer and one that
achieves a flawless look that lasts all
day it's lightweight moisturizing and it
provides full coverage without clogging
pores it's supposed to be 12-hour wear a
breathable formula and it's ideal for
very dry to combination oily skin types
that's crazy
very dry that's two completely different
skin types like very dry and then
combination oily it's two totally
different skin type it says it forms a
flexible film that moves with the skin
for long-lasting wear and dries slowly
for easy blending blah blah blah just
one tip of the wand gives you a full
face up just one dip of the one gives
you a full face application and it can
be used to spot conceal to do to rich
pigment level that enhances this
flawless coverage makeup shades may
appear deeper when first applied once
blended completely and allowed to dry
the beyond perfecting makeup will blend
into your skin for a beyond perfect
flawless look a little goes a long way
one hundred-percent fragrance free it's
allergy tested blah blah blah it doesn't
say how to apply it like it doesn't say
with a brush or um a sponge but you know
we're gonna do both ways today so that's
a lot of claims and I like that it says
it's going to apply darker and then
adjust to your skin tone so that's good
to know like right off the bat
cuz I already feel like the shade is
gonna be a little too dark on me so I'm
going to apply my regular primers you
guys know the Smashbox primer water the
benefit matte rescue and for the pore
minimizer and mattifying primer I'm
going to use these soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck
of a blot primers what I look forward to
foundation is something that's not going
to make me Orly throughout the day that
so in doesn't enhance my pores
long-lasting and that also just looks
nice on the skin so again I'm in the
shade a golden neutral just a little
dark for me but we shall see okay so
let's just take it out that is HUGE
this reminds me of the tarp concealer
wand like that is jut yet they're
literally like the same size if you're
wondering how big the one is if you have
this concealer it's exactly the same
size I don't know how I like this for
foundation I feel like it's a little bit
not sanitary but I mean you know
whatever we're just gonna put some
everywhere you know I'm just gonna do it
first impression style so this side I'm
going to apply it with the Beauty
Blender yeah that's definitely full
coverage I think I used too much hahaha
Wow okay I honestly didn't expect this
from a foundation we're gonna go ahead
and put it underneath the eyes too since
it's supposed to conceal a little bit so
we just do that take it back
that actually is like a pretty good
shade I'm impressed
now you can see you cover up the redness
really well I mean I don't have to go
over it at all I would have done a one
less stripe over here is because I don't
need it and I so far I like the finish
of it sorry I keep sniffling I can't
decide if I'm coming down with something
or not the true test is my nose though
like what to see how well it covers on
my note and then for a brush I'm going
to use this morphe g4 brush I'm going to
apply this the brush
I feel like I like it a little bit
better with the Beautyblender um I feel
like I could blend it out more it's a
little less coverage um with a brush
which some people might find weird I
find that the milliner gives me more
coverage most the time but some people
say it sheers out their foundation I'm
like a playoffs I feel like it covers
more just because I'm not rubbing it all
over my face but I don't I don't mind
the brush though like the brush really
blends it in nicely you can just see
just right here it's like a little
patchy and I covered my nose really well
I didn't apply like product right to my
nose so the fact that the excess product
helped cover that is awesome I'm really
kind of nervous if it's gonna hold up on
my skin and not make me very oily
because as if it can work for a really
dry skin and oily combination skin it
just I don't know I don't know I'm like
nervous I don't know if it's gonna last
but we shall see that's why we're doing
force impression this is what it looks
like I think it looks really flawless it
does have like a bit of a glow to it but
it's not shiny and oily looking um I'll
have to set this with a powder for sure
so I'm going to go ahead and finish the
rest of my face makeup and then I'll be
back to give you a little update on how
at war as I applied the rest of my
makeup
okay so I've officially gotten the rest
of my face makeup on and I have to say I
really like the way that this foundation
looks so far it really handled all the
product that I put on my face really
well and everything just glided on and
blended so well and I love this color of
the foundation I think it matches
perfectly with my body I'm so happy with
it my pores do not look bigger I feel
like it just glided over my acne and it
really like makes my skin look nice and
smooth even up here where I have some
lines it just looks really nice and
smooth it doesn't sink into those lines
so I really like that and yeah so far so
good
I'm loving it so far I can't wait to
wear it throughout the day and update
you guys right now it's a little late
it's actually 3 o'clock on the dot
so yeah I'll go throughout my day I got
some errands to run and things to do so
I will keep you guys updated and I'll
see you in just a second but a few hours
for me so hey guys so it is now 726 and
it's been like what 4 and a half hour
to get my nails done pretty pumped about
that I let them have a break for a
couple weeks and now I got them back on
so I feel like myself again I haven't
touched up anything with my makeup I
haven't put on more pad or anything like
that I am a little bit shiny in here but
it's not the kind of shiny where I feel
like my oil is like just sitting on top
of my skin like when I touch it it feels
like a powdery soft finish it doesn't
feel like a ton of oil that's really
nice
that's impressive what I'm gonna do is
I'm just going to add some powder and I
should probably blot but I don't have
anything the blunt with I don't have
anything to blot with right now so I'm
just gonna add a little bit of powder
like on my chin right here in all my
nose and the center of my forehead which
is where I get the most oily I'm just
going to take the laura mercier
translucent setting powder so I'm just
going to take a little bit of that and
pop it on my chin I would recommend
blotting off the oil before powdering
but you know mama doesn't have any right
now foundation looks beautiful I was
looking at it um the last place I went
to was the nail salon and I was looking
at my skin right before I had left and I
was like wow I look so good it looked
awesome in daylight it looked awesome in
like low lighting for resting lights it
looked just it looks so good my pores
don't look like they're huge they look
minimized they I mean it just kind of
looks poreless and I'm really surprised
at this foundation because I really
didn't have that high hopes for it but
it turns out it's really really nice and
the finish is just beautiful that's my
update so far I'm going to keep wearing
this I don't go to bed till pretty late
and I have a lot of work to do I will
catch you guys in just a few hours to
give you a final conclusion on this
foundation hey guys so I'm back with my
last update of the night it is
officially eleven seventeen I am tired
I'm ready to take his makeup off and I'm
ready to go to bed I just want to give
you guys a rundown what I think about
this foundation you kind of see now it
is pretty shiny
I have not blot or added more powder
since the last check that I had with you
guys I think if I would have gone
through the day using my blotting sheets
adding powder here and there it would
have looked completely fine the whole
day this is a little too shiny for me
this is not what I like because I can
tell them a little bit oily but again it
doesn't really feel like the oil is
sitting on top of my
it's weird like I can see the shine but
I don't necessarily feel it I do feel
like this is a really long-lasting
foundation and I personally love the
finish I love the coverage I really love
this foundation I don't really know
about the concealer part I don't really
add extra concealer on top of my face if
I have a full coverage foundation on if
something's just not covering up I'll
usually just let it be or add a little
bit more foundation on top but with my
breakout today right here I mean it's
still really covered you can't see it at
all and I think if you did have a
breakout like that this would cover it
kind of like on the first go around as
you're applying the foundation unless
you kind of rub some of it off and you
had to go back in with this product but
I really like this foundation I love
this color on me the golden neutral I
just love how warm it is I love the way
it makes my hair look and then it's
weird but I just like the color so much
of this I need this color and every
single foundation that I have I think
this is definitely gonna be my new
favorite I'm so excited to use this
again tomorrow and my favorite way I
feel like to apply it is with a Beauty
Blender I mean both ways it's beautiful
with my Beauty Blender is dirty one day
and I want to use brush I'm gonna use a
brush because I feel like it looks just
as good I feel like it is a little more
sheer at some points if you keep trying
to blend it in but that's fine because I
feel like this is still a great
foundation I hundred percent agree that
it's a full coverage foundation I do
think it adjusted to my skin why are you
looking at me like that
Daisy's looking at me like why why me
God we're about to go night-night don't
worry I do think people with dry skin
could wear this because when I first
applied it it did have that kind of
glowy look to it and I had to set it
with powder when I saw that it was that
glowy it was kind of nervous because I
was like oh god I know what this means
but once I baked and set my face and you
know just put everything else on it just
worked so well throughout the day so I
think everybody should try this it's a
great foundation but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and let me
know down below if you've tried this
foundation if not what's the foundation
that I should try next
I'm a face product junkie so I'm all
about trying new things and yeah thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you guys in my next video bye
when the night is over
my life is over cuz I start thinking
again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
