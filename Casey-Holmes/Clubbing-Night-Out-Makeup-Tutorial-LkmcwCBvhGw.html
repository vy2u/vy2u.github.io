a night out makeup tutorial it's just a
little smoky eyes so let's go ahead and
get started the first thing I'm gonna do
is prime my eyes on my Mac Paint Pot in
soft ochre and then I'm gonna take this
scotch tape you can use whatever tape
you have and just take off a piece and
put it on the back of your hand a couple
times just to loosen up the glue because
we don't want to pull our eye too much
when we're taking off the tape then I'm
going to angle this on my from my lower
lash line to my eyebrow and just a nice
angled motion so I can get a really
sharp line and if you're wondering my
eyebrows are filled in I'm gonna take
this Maybelline eye studio quad and cozy
cashmere I'm gonna go take a flat shader
brush with the lightest color in the
palette putting this all over the inner
half of my lid and kind of taking it up
to the brow bone as well then I'm gonna
take a blending brush with the kind of
plum color that's on the end and I'm
just going to blend this in in the outer
part of my eye and you'll be able to see
I really do keep this in the outer
corner of my eye just keep it in that
nice v-shape and I'm blending it in
towards the center of my lid because I
really want that nice soft kind of smoky
effect taking the wet and wild vanity
palette I'm going to take kind of that
medium toned skin color and I'm just
going to put this in the middle to help
blend the two colors together then going
in with the kind of orange color I don't
know what you would want to call this
but I also put this in the middle to
help the color fade into the dark a
little bit better then I'm gonna take
the really dark sparkly shade and I'm
really gonna focus this on the very
outer corners of my eye just to really
deepen up the look this palette is
amazing because you can use all four
colors certain amount of colors it
doesn't matter this palette is gorgeous
and I love it they look so beautiful
together going in with my Sigma
eyeshadow I forget what this is called
but I'll put an annotation here I'm
gonna just put this underneath my brows
to highlight and I really like to focus
this on the highest
point of my brow as well so now it's
time to take off the tape
taking a pencil brush I'm going back in
with that shimmery dark color and I'm
going to smudge this underneath my lower
lash line
from the very outer corner all the way
to the inner corner we just really want
to smooth this out then I'm taking a Mac
coal liner and smolder and I'm just
going to put this on my waterline taking
a blending brush I'm gonna blend any
harsh lines and kind of make sure I have
a nice blended shadow look going on
taking my next the curved liner I'm just
going to line my eyes and of course do a
winged because I'm always doing a winged
it just makes my eyes more lifted and
just look a lot better because I do have
sort of this kind of frowny eyes I guess
you could say now I'm taking you so long
perfect demi wispies and I love these
I'm just going to put these on my
eyeballs and I did use the duo lash glue
and clear if you're wondering and I'm
still getting used to lashes so like
full complete lashes I'm not very good
at them yet but it's taken me some time
but I'm working on it
taking your favorite mascara I'm using
the L'Oreal telescopic carbon black I
have a review on this I will put it in
the bottom bar below I'm just gonna
blend my real and false lashes together
then I'm going to go over the glue with
my NYX curved liner just to help kind of
hide the glue and of course add more
mascara taking this angled brush from
Sigma I'll put an annotation what it is
I'm just going to use this covergirl
Olay simply ageless corrector that I'm
obsessed with and I'm going to just kind
of clean up the edges of this eye look
with this concealer and blend it out
with a bigger brush this is a very
dramatic look so I do kind of use more
products in this video than I would
normally use on a day-to-day basis and
then I'm going in with my makeup forever
matte Bella plus with this Sigma brush
as well and I felt like using a brush to
this day so I just end up buffing this
all over my skin and the reason why my
foundation is darker than my face color
is because I don't self tan my face so
it does match my neck I promise but I
mean you can just tell the difference
concealer and foundation makes with the
eye look
in saying it looks so much better now to
me now going in with this namely mineral
power concealer I'm obsessed with this
I'm just gonna dot a couple dots
underneath my eyes and blend it out with
this same Sigma brush I will have
annotations of what these are exactly
going on my makeup forever super matte
loose powder with that same brush I'm
going to set my under eyes and also my
face makeup with this it's my favorite
transparent powder ever I love it then
I'm going to on my hoola benefit bronzer
and I'm going to take this Sedona lace
if I think it's f30 brush I can't
remember but I'm going to use this brush
just to bronze up my face and then I'm
gonna go in with a Sephora brush which
is a little bit smaller and denser and
I'm really gonna heavily contour with it
so I'm going to use this one it's called
the contour brush I do believe and like
I said I'm just gonna contour heavily
so just go on along the hollows of my
cheeks and the tops of my temples or
forehead whichever then I'm taking this
Nara NARS blush and dowser love this
color
and I'm just going to apply this to my
cheeks then I'm taking the bombs
mary-lou manizer which is a beautiful
highlight with this Sedona lace fan
brush and I'm just gonna apply this to
the tops of my cheekbones and a little
bit above my brows taking this Rimmel
lip liner and natural I just lined my
lips topped it off with Max creme de new
lipstick and then also went in with
Mac's
prolong wear lip glass in patients pleas
and I love this combo too I've been
really loving Mac products for my lips
lately and that's pretty much it guys so
