videos planned and some hair tutorials I
wanted to do but this weekend has just
finished shambles I fill in the hair
tutorial yesterday and it won't import
to my macbook but I figured I would just
take a break from doing a tutorial and
do a fun little tag that was actually
tied by in gray which is missglamorazzi
to do the colors of the rainbow tag and
it was also tagged by eleventhgorgeous
so Thank You girls I thought it was a
cute tag you know you just do the colors
of the rainbow and kind of have products
to go with it we're gonna go ahead and
get started and the first color is red
and what I chose for my red products is
this big sexy hair root pump I love this
stuff if you want some volume to your
hair this is viously I'm making a mess
if you want some volume in your hair
this is definitely the way to go
it gives me so much volume I'll put this
in my roots so my hair is damp and I'll
just blow dry my hair like upside down
to the side you know the opposite way
the hair you know would fall so I have a
lot more volume when it comes down and I
just love it if you have a chance to try
it out I definitely recommend it the
next color is orange and I chose my
Tarte blush this is the Amazonian clay
blush in tipsy and it's just a gorgeous
kind of coral orange shade the outside
is basically orange so that's why I
chose it but these Amazonian clay
blushes are amazing they last for so
long and they just look really beautiful
on the skin and these blushes are so so
smooth now for yellow I definitely had
to pick something with yellow packaging
and I chose my Bahama Mama bronzer from
the balm because this is just an
essential for me and I feel like in the
summer time this is gonna be great
because it's super super dark and it's
just gonna look awesome to contour with
so I've talked about in a favorites
video before and I just read love it for
green I chose my Holy Grail hair mask
yzi macadamia do prepare mass love this
stuff kicking up it smells so good it
makes your hair feel amazing I do this
at least once a week to my hair I only
wash my hair about 2 to 3 times a week
but this definitely goes in one time
I just love it mixing hair so soft and I
feel like I can go more days that
washing my hair when I use this product
they're blue I chose the Neutrogena eye
makeup remover wipes I love these so
much I think they're just amazing
they're not too strong they don't sting
my eyes or anything like that and they
take off all my makeup and I just work
really well for my sensitive skin for
indigo I think this is indigo we'll see
when the light hits it it looks into go
I don't know if you can see but like
when I look through the bottle right
here
it's definitely indigo so I chose my
nume argan oil I love this stuff I
mentioned this a lot before and it's
just great makes my hair super soft at
the ends and I don't really honestly
have many split ends anymore because of
the products I've been using like the
macadamia with paramedics this I've been
used in the eight to ten and they all
they're working really well with my hair
so I definitely have to mention this
next it's a color violet I think this is
violet I'm hoping so it's an Essie nail
polish and play date and it's just a
gorgeous purple color I love this one so
much I think I got it sometime last year
or probably got this year at some point
I can't remember but it's just a really
pretty purple color and I always love
love love someone else because it's not
too dark and it's not too light so the
nice color after violet is pink and I
just had to include this because I use
all the time and it's literally a
product I cannot get enough of and it is
the beauty blenders I have three now and
I just love them so much I got my first
one back I think it was in November I
did a first impression on it so if you
want to see that I'll leave it down
below I think it's just an essential
with makeup especially for the
summertime because it just really makes
your foundation should go on flawlessly
and you don't have to use a lot of
product to make it go on and cover very
well so I love the Beauty Blender it's
really rare to find me putting
foundation all in the brush and usually
if I am it's because my beauty blenders
are too dirty which they need to be
washed now and
one is multicolored this is the one I
was most excited about because I love
anything that has different colors and
just kind of out there but this actually
perched just recently this is the pure
Paradise Beach bronze leg shine this is
from Bath and Body Works but it smells
really good and it's basically like a
shine spray and this is what the product
looks like and all you do you just spray
it on your body oh god it smells so good
and just think she likes shimmer you
probably can't see it in the camera but
oh it smells so good it just smells like
summer and it's a gorgeous bottle just a
little bit of sparkle and this is
definitely gonna be my go-to and it
smells amazing I don't know how many
times I can say that so I hope you guys
enjoyed the colors of the rainbow tag
this is a fun one for me to do just
mentioning some more of my favourite
products you guys so much for watching
and I'll tag some people down below to
do this and if you do this tag for free
to live as a video response and I will
see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
