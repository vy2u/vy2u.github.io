a makeup tutorial on this look it's just
a fun copper and bright cobalt blue look
and I absolutely love it I want to do
another look incorporating the Urban
Decay electric palette I did use the
color chaos again which it looks purple
on camera by promising you this is the
most gorgeous cobalt blue ever and I
wanted to use again so that's like this
today and I also use one of my favorite
pigments from Mac this is copper sparkle
and it is so gorgeous I love coppers and
anything like that especially on my
brown eyes so yes I hope you guys
enjoyed this look if you end up trying
it out or any of the looks that I do on
my channel then please hash tag me on
instagram at kc HL 91 or send it to me
on Twitter or my facebook page I'll have
all of my links down below in the
description box and thank you guys so
much for watching if you liked this look
then please give it a thumbs up and
let's go ahead and get on to the
tutorial okay so first off I did prime
my eyes with my normal primers and then
we're going to go in with soft brown
from Mac and this is going to be our
transition shade so we're just going to
blend this all into the crease and make
sure it's nice and blended out
next we're gonna take tape and we are
going to just angle this from our lower
lash line up to our brow and this is
just going to help give you a nice clean
line especially since we are working
with a messy pigment taking max which
chocolate and I believe this is a 217
for Mac I'm going to blend this color
into the outer half of my eye this is
mainly where I want to focus the most of
this color just because it is a deeper
shade but it's not too dark so it's
going to add that little bit of depth
that we want in this makeup look so
focus it on the outer V and then you can
drag a little bit into the crease as
well just to kind of help blend
everything together I'm going to take
this Mac pigment and then I'm going to
spray my Sigma brush first with fix+
just so that the pigment goes on the lid
really nicely and doesn't just fly all
over the place so I'm going to press
this pigment onto my lid just press it
all over and the reason why we put Swiss
chocolate on beforehand is because if we
were to put the pigment down and then go
in with Swiss chocolate it would just
make everything a huge mess I mean you
would get glitter everywhere so putting
Swiss chocolate down first and then
going in with the pigment is really
going to help make things easier for you
I like that technique I used to always
do the outer V last but I've learned to
do it first and then do the pigment it's
just so much easier
so after you're happy with the way the
pigment looks I'm going back in with
that brush that we used with Swiss
chocolate and I did not put any extra
product on it I'm just blending out the
edges of that pigment just so nothing's
too harsh and then we're going to go
ahead and move on to face and I'm going
to take my Mac prep and Prime vibrancy
eye primer and apply this underneath my
eyes I did apply way too much um but I
ended up wiping a bunch of it off and
then I'm going on with Smashbox photo
matte primer and applying this where I
get the most oily which is always my
t-zone next up we're taking our
foundation this is a l'oreal true match
foundation i have been using this for a
while now and i just absolutely love it
let me know in the comments what your
favorite drugstore products are i plan
on going to the drugstore really soon
and trying to hunt down some of these
and new products so let me know what
your favorites are just so i could pick
up some new things to show you guys and
kind of try out but i'm just applying
this foundation with a Beauty Blender
and it's just my favorite way to apply
it I think it just sinks into the skin
so nicely so I'm going in with my Mac
Pro Longwear concealer and also my NARS
radiant creamy concealer and I like the
Mac one to put underneath my eyes and on
my chin lip and forehead and then I use
the NARS one on the top of my nose just
to highlight and help kind of highlight
and contour the nose so it looks a
little bit smaller I got a big nose so
we do as much as we can
after that we're going to set that
concealer this is the Anasazi a contour
kit and I'm using the banana shade and
I'm just going to set my under eye with
this I believe this is a sigma f-35
brush and I've been really enjoying this
just to set everything in place and then
for our face we are taking the Laura
Mercier translucent powder which is by
far my favorite and I'm going to set the
rest of my face makeup with this to
contour I'm using the hoola bronzer from
benefit and I love this as you can see
I've hit some major panel miss it's just
one of my favorites I have a full
highlighting and contouring for you guys
down below if you want to stay an
in-depth tutorial I still do the exact
same routine and everything so if you
want to check that out I'll leave it
down below for you but I figured I would
just go ahead and show you guys me doing
this now
then going in with my NARS blush in
Madley I really love this blush I feel
like it goes with any look that I do
just because it's that nice warm bronzy
apricot color I just I feel like I can
use it with anything so I wanted to use
it for this look just because it's not
going to take away from the eyes so I
just applied this to my cheeks and then
blend it out with a duo fiber brush I
believe this one's from Sedona lace and
then going in with the Sigma eyebrow
pencils these are new I think they came
out last month but I'm just going to be
using two different shades
I'll leave the names of them down below
and I just apply the darker shade on the
outer half of my brow and then the
lighter shade on the inner part again I
will have a brow tutorial below if
you're interested then we're applying
the liner and false lashes and they also
have a liner and lashes tutorial if you
want to check it out it's very very
in-depth then taking this 2-4 liner I'm
lining my lower lash line and my
waterline this completely came off my
waterline like immediately after I put
it on so I ended up just lining the
waterline with a black liner and then
I'm taking the color chaos from the
Urban Decay electric palette which is
just a gorgeous cobalt blue and telling
you oh I just love this and looking at
this look now it reminds me of Auburn
I'm a huge iron fan so I was like hey I
know what I can wear to a football game
but I'm just applying chaos all over my
bottom lashes and don't be afraid to
drag this color down a little bit and
make it really smoky then I'm going to
take this NYX mascara this is also
cobalt blue it looks purple on camera
but I promise you it's cobalt blue and
this is just going to help that lower
lash line pop even more
taking max trip down I'm going to apply
this on my lips perfect lip liner I love
it because it makes my lips look super
full and it goes with a bunch of
different lipsticks that I have and this
is a new lipstick that I've gotten
recently it's from Sonia Kashuk I can't
remember the name I think it's pinky
beige but I'll leave it down below for
you guys and I'm just going to apply
this all over my lips it's a great
darker nude great for everyday and then
I forget what gloss this is I'll leave
the name down below I forgot to get a
clip of this and also the highlighter
that I used which the one I used was the
Laura Mercier highlighter in number one
it's really awesome I love it it's not
too much of a highlight so you just get
a nice glow from it and then to
highlight the brow bone and also the
inner corners of the eyes I'm going to
be taking shroom from Mac which has been
one of my favorite highlight shades ever
since I've gotten it so after you're
done with that you are good to go with
this look so I hope you all enjoyed it
if you like the more colorful looks then
please give this video a thumbs up and I
will see you all in my next one bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
