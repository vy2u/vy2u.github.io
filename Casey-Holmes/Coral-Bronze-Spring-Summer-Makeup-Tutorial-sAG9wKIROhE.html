all about the eyeshadow look that I had
in my last video which was my a winged
eyeliner in lashes tutorial I had so so
many questions and requests on the look
that I had and I mentioned in the
beginning of the video if you wanted me
to do a tutorial I would totally do it
for you so if I didn't answer your
question in the comments about what
colors I was wearing it's because I
wanted to do a tutorial for you and this
is a super easy look to achieve at least
the eye makeup is I love to kind of
experiment with different things on my
face but the eye shadows they're just
three different eye shadows or actually
for counting the highlight and they are
from Mac so there is quite a bit of
high-end products in here just because
I've been doing a lot of shopping at
Sephora recently so there's going to be
a lot of different products shown in
this video that I haven't shown before I
am sorry that they're all high-end but
I'll do more drugstore stuff for you
guys very soon but I absolutely love
this look it's really bronzed and tan in
the face with a good bit of highlight
and then you have this coral orange eye
with just a bold liner lashes and you're
good to go
I think this is perfect for spring and
summer of course if you're gonna be out
all day and then summertime I would not
recommend this look unless you're like
inside or something but I think this is
a great look that everybody can do
because it is so simple to recreate it's
just about blending all the eyeshadow
and not having any harsh lines I promise
you you can do it I know you can and so
yeah I am excited to show you guys this
tutorial so if you want to see how I got
this makeup look then just keep watching
okay first we're gonna prep our skin I'm
going to be taking this Mac oil control
lotion and taking a few pumps of that
and I'm going to be applying this all
over my face and I really like this
lotion especially for my oily skin I do
feel like it helps keep me matte but
still moisturized at the same time then
I'm taking my Mac of prep and prime
vibrancy eye primer I take about a pump
and a half of this and put this
underneath my eyes this again is really
nice and hydrating and it adds a really
nice glow underneath the eyes as well
I'm going to prime my eyes with
my normal primers which you guys have
seen me use before and then I'm going
with max eyeshadow and saddle and the
Sigma e-40 brush and I'm just going to
blend this all over the crease
so I'm just applying this all over the
crease and lid as well then I'm going in
with Mac's eyeshadow in coral I really
like this color but I feel like it's not
as pretty as it looks in the pan but Kim
but pairing it with this next shade
which is the color rule for Mac I love
them both together
so I'm going to take role in a sigma e25
and blend this directly into the crease
I'm not going to blend this above the
crease or on my lid I just really want
to focus it right there in the crease to
blend out that coral shade and help it
fade better with saddle I think a rule
and quarrel together are absolutely
beautiful of course they complement each
other and I just I love this look so if
you're having a hard time trying to wear
different colors or even oranges this is
the way to go because it is so pretty
and very wearable
so then I'm gonna blend out any lines or
anything I want to be blended out and
then I'm gonna apply my liner and lashes
I have a full video on it so if you want
to see it I'll link it right down below
for you time to prime the face I'm going
to be taking my bare minerals Brian
prime time BB thingy this is in the
color medium i'll leave the name of it
down below but i really like this to
help neutralize some of the redness
before i apply foundation and then for
foundation i will be using my Estee
Lauder Double Wear in four in one I
really like this foundation a lot in my
last video I believe I had the L'Oreal
True Match on but I really wanted to use
this one because the color matched a lot
better for me so I'm gonna take my Sigma
f80 and just blend this all over the
skin taking my Mac Pro Longwear
concealer in nw20 and once we applying
this underneath my eyes and also in the
center of my face just to highlight now
you can use as much or as little
concealer as you want this looks like a
ton of concealer which it is more than
you probably want to put on your face
but when I blend it in with a Beauty
Blender the Beauty Blender kind of soaks
up some of the excess product and really
just blends it in nicely so it's not
cakey or too much so I like to do mine
in a triangle motion underneath my eyes
again just to highlight the face so like
I said the Beauty Blender does kind of
soak up some of that product but still
blends everything and sinks it into the
skin really nicely
taking my NARS concealer in custard I'm
going to apply this on my nose I don't
know what it is about this concealer but
I absolutely love to highlight my nose
with this I just think it is so easy and
then I'm gonna take my foundation brush
again with no additional product on it
and just blend out any of the harsh
lines from the highlighting just so
everything looks seamless
setting the under-eye concealer I'm
going to take my Anasazi out contour kit
and I'm going to be using the middle
banana shade with the sigma f-35 I'm
gonna press this on top of my concealer
you don't want to swipe you want to
press just so you don't move product
around taking the Laura Mercier powder
this isn't translucent I love
translucent powders especially if you're
using a heavy foundation and this one's
been really nice taking the Laura
Mercier bronzer in number two and this
Marc Jacobs brush I finally started to
use this and this brush is definitely
amazing I'm going to first bronze the
top of my forehead with this I love this
bronzer so much it is not too red it is
not too orange it's like the perfect
warm tan color I love it so much it is
so creamy and blends out beautifully so
if you're looking for a new bronzer this
one is amazing
taking my NARS eita brush I'm going to
also do a slight contour this powder is
not going to give you a super defined
contour but it still gives me that
definition I'm looking for
taking this NARS blush in Manly this is
such a gorgeous blush you guys I'm
obsessed with it as like a bronzy
apricot color and it is so gorgeous this
is the most creamiest amazing blush I've
ever tried from NARS I'm obsessed with
it then I'm taking this Mac mineralize
skinfinish in global glow and with a duo
fiber brush I'm going to lightly apply
just a tad of this on top of that blush
just to give it a little bit more Shane
NARS madly does have some shimmer in it
but it's not too noticeable when it's on
your face but I wanted a little bit more
glow so I added that on top and since we
used a duo fiber brush it doesn't pick
up a lot of product taking Becca's
highlighter in opal I will also be
highlighting with this this is the
perfect color for a gorgeous bronzed
face
I'm going to go ahead and do my eyebrows
and then after that I'm gonna take
shroom by Mac again one of my favorite
highlighters ever ever since I purchased
it I can't stop using it and I'm just
going to apply this underneath my brows
if you want to see a brow routine video
I will link that in the description box
as well
then I'm going to take both quarrel and
rule that we applied earlier on our lids
and I'm going to put these underneath my
lower lash line and really smoke it out
this will help bring everything together
taking this Rimmel eyeliner in nude I'm
going to apply this to my waterline just
to make my eyes look a little bit bigger
then taking the clinic bottom lash
mascara I'm going to apply this to my
bottom lashes because it's pretty much
amazing it gets right to the root and
really coats all of the lashes now this
is my go-to lip combo I cannot get
enough of it I have been wearing this
non-stop since I got these products so
I'm gonna be taking Mac stripped down
and I'm going to be aligning my lips
with this and then I'm going to go in
with this Mac lipstick and freckle tone
which is a gorgeous peachy nude I used
to not like colors like this but this
lipstick has completely changed my mind
it is so beautiful and I just adore it
now and then I'm topping it off with the
whitening lightening color smile lip
gloss and nude because it's just when my
favourites so I'm just gonna place on
top of the lip combo and you are done
