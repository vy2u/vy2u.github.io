a makeup tutorial on this look I love my
neutrals but I think a pop of color is
really fun for spring and summer so this
is one of the looks that I did today
incorporating some color into it I want
to do another one with maybe some
turquoise and stuff like that but this
is the Maybelline eye studio quad in
coral Oh a sis and this is the quad I'll
be using today I absolutely love the
colors these two are my favorites I
think they're just beautiful and by far
my favorite eyeshadow is from the
drugstore are these Maybelline quads
I just did one not too long ago with the
copper quad I can't member I think it's
called copper chic so I'll leave that
down below if you guys want to check it
out if you're not really into color and
you don't really know how to incorporate
it in your eye lips I think this will be
the perfect way to go because it's not
too much but it's still a little bit
different than just the regular neutral
Brown so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'll have links to everything that
I mentioned down below in the
description box and don't forget to like
the video if you liked it and I will see
you guys in my next one okay first off
we're priming our face I'm using my
hourglass primer this was a sample it's
the mineral veil primer and I've been
really really loving it I think it's an
awesome primer it just creates a nice
smooth surface to your skin and then X
I'm going to prime my eyes with my usual
primers I'll have them listed down below
and then going in with this light brown
shade from the lorac palette I'm going
to put this into my crease as a
transition shade and it will also have
all of the brushes I used listed in
order down below in the description box
if you're interested
taking the coral Oasis palette I'm going
to start with the lighter lime green
shade and I'm going to be using it on
this brush and I'm going to apply this
to the first part of my lid so right at
the tear duct to about halfway on the
lid and you just really want to pack
this color on because you really want it
to stand out
next I'm taking the orange shade and I'm
just going to be applying this to the
rest of my eyelid just turning that
brush over and applying it like so and
you'll see me kind of swiping it back
and forth between the green and that's
just to make sure it all blends together
and kind of adds like a faded effect
next taking the darkest shade in the
palette and this brush so I'm going to
be applying this to the outer V and also
bringing this in to the crease just a
little bit as well by the way don't mind
my eyebrows they've got to be groomed
and so do my nails
except for going back in and we're just
touching up the colors that we put on
our lid I just want to make sure these
stand out really well under a nice and
vibrant
then we're just going to be blending out
any harsh lines
taking my concealer I'm just going to
clean up the outer edges of my shadow
you can use tape beforehand or you can
just use makeup remover but concealer is
my preferred way
next up I'm just touching up that crease
shade with this brush I'm just really
lightly running this brush into my
crease with some of the product just to
deepen it up a little bit
for foundation I'm going to be using my
favorite foundation that Estee Lauder
Double Wear I'm using two different
colors so I'll put them in the
description box below so I'm just using
this foundation with my Sigma f80 brush
now applying my mac prolongwear
concealer in nw20 applying this
underneath my eyes
I'm blending it out with this Sigma f80
six and as you can see when I start
blending it out it also kind of dragged
a little bit onto my forehead and on my
chin just to highlight
for bronzer I'll be using the hoola
bronzer from benefit and the NARS brush
this NARS brush is back in stock on
Nordstrom so I'll leave the link for it
down below if you're interested because
it has been sold out forever now
taking this blush from Maybelline this
is like my new favorite blush I
absolutely love the color of it I'm just
going to be applying this to the apples
of my cheeks and then blending out with
a duo fiber brush
taking this Mac highlighter I think it's
in perfect topping I think it's called
that it was from a recent collection
it's going to be highlighting my face
with this
and then I'm gonna go back in and
contour my nose and use this Sigma brush
I will list the Sigma brush down below
like I said but this brush has been
awesome to contour my nose I found that
it's made it really really easy to get
to really even lines and also blend them
out really nicely so they don't look too
harsh
going in with my Tarte Amazonian clay
brow mousse and taupe I'm just going to
be filling in my brows
and I will be applying a winged eyeliner
today and to do that I'm using my
favorite liquid liner at the moment
which is the L'Oreal super slim eyeliner
in black
I'm my upper and lower waterline I'll be
using this Rimmel scandaleyes eyeliner
in black as well
taking these velour lashes and doll me
up in any mascara you choose this is
just a sample that I had I'm going to be
applying those and these are my favorite
lashes at the moment
and I highlighted with the color that
was in the palette but I wasn't
satisfied with it so I ended up going
back into the lower acapella and taking
that beige shade and putting this right
underneath the arch of my brow
now I'm taking my clinic bottom lash
mascara which I love
now minding my lips with my Revlon
Colorstay lipliner in nude then I'll be
putting on this covergirl lipstick in
cream which was from one of their spring
collections I believe then topping it
off with my whitening lightening lip
gloss and nude which is by far my
favorite I do have a coupon code for
this down below if you are interested
and that is it so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and I will see you guys in my
next one
