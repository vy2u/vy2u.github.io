a review and a demo on the new covergirl
outlast stay fabulous foundation and
this is what it looks like I have been
trying this out for a few months and
I've been meaning to do a video on it
but I've just kind of been you know busy
or I've forgotten about it wanted to do
another video instead so I finally
decided to sit down a dedicated video to
this foundation because I really do love
it by the way speaking of lighting and
echoing and everything like that you
guys are gonna have to just bear with me
I don't know why this room echos I'm
guessing because it's so bare and
basically all I have in here is my
vanity but I hope when I get some
furniture in here that the echoing will
stop because I don't know how to stop
echoing I don't know how you do that so
it's not have to find some other way to
try and get rid of the echo and also for
lighting today I guess natural light
coming in with the ring light I know the
ring light was really bright in my last
video so I do apologize but make sure
you upgrade this video in 1080p to get
the best quality for my videos so I do
have two colors the one that I used
today and that you'll see in the video
is in medium beige and this color is a
shade lighter for me but once I bronze
my face up with my hoola benefit bronzer
and if you could see it just matches my
neck so I say this foundation is like
two shades too light for me but I feel
like these foundations do dry darker
than what they look like when you first
apply them to your skin that can either
be a good benefit if you accidentally
bought a shake to light but if you went
too dark then you would definitely have
to return it now for oily skin I do have
very very oily skin it gets very oily in
my t-zone I'll apply it nice day about
four hours later that's when I need to
powder up which is pretty good if you
have very oily skin because sometimes
I'll use foundation and I'll have to
touch up like thirty minutes later
because my shine is coming through I'm
like oh god Nev go block this because I
look a greasy mess so saying that I do
think the weather kind of has a little
bit of an effect with this foundation
for not having to touch
until four hours think in the summertime
it would go to probably two hours that I
would have to touch up but still it's a
matte foundation it's gorgeous I don't
know if I would recommend it for super
dry skin I think it would just enhance
you know the dry skin that you have on
your face if you do have dry skin let me
know if you like it because I don't have
dry skin so I wouldn't know but this is
just what I'm seeing from putting it on
to my oily skin now this foundation has
not oxidized on me at all and it's
lasted for I'd say a good 11 hours I can
keep this foundation on which is really
great and I also have to say I know I
used to love the Revlon Colorstay
foundation but this has taken its spot
it is not as cakey it looks so amazing
on the skin it actually looks like your
skin but just a lot better and also it's
not as heavy at all it's really nice and
lightweight and I love that and it has
that full coverage finish that most of
us do like if I'm going to take the
extra step to put foundation on I want
it to be full coverage so I love the
fact that it is a full coverage
foundation and it is buildable so you'll
see in the video when I take my Beauty
Blender and I'll apply it once I see a
couple spots like just on my cheeks
where I get really red that means it's a
little extra coverage so I just started
a couple dots on those redness and once
I blended it out it was beautiful so I
do think this is still available
foundation and yeah that's pretty much
all I have to say I honestly have no
negative things today has a great prize
it's from covergirl and I love covergirl
and I knew once I started trying them
out and I said this and my you know
yearly favorites covergirl is something
you need to try out I know a bunch of us
probably tried it years and years ago I
know I did and I was like oh my god
what am I putting on my face they have
upped up their game so you need to check
out more stuff from them because I
haven't personally buy a ton of stuff
from covergirl and I've been loving it
so make sure you try them out if you
have tried it on the spot nation let me
know what you think of it in the
comments below I would love to hear what
you think of it
humph I'm gonna do basically like what I
did in my current foundation routine
you're just gonna dot it it in like the
T part of my face and then just start
blending it out okay you guys are gonna
excuse my hands cuz you don't my hands
do not like self-tanner so that's like
one application I do like it but I also
feel like this cup this foundation it's
buildable so I will take a half a pump
and I'll just put it on the redness I
have which is basically my cheeks right
here by my nose and my forehead so again
just blending that out
so this is what the foundation looks
like after its dried and that into my
skin and I bronze my face up to help
match the color to my neck and I really
love that I just think it looks so
beautiful on this pan so I hope you guys
enjoy and I'll see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
