a hair tutorial and as you can tell by
the title this is a Lilly ghalichi
inspired hair tutorial now her hair is a
lot bigger than this but for me this is
really big hair and I think for like the
average person that wants to try
extensions and get really big hair this
would be sufficient for you and I kind
of just went off her look of the middle
part and kind of like the big loose
curls her hair is just a lot more like
out to here and it is gorgeous
I'm followed Lily on Instagram for a
very long time now and her hair is
always something that I envy and like
her little blam squad is so amazing her
hair and makeup is literally perfection
every time I just enjoy it so much but
yeah I'm going to show you guys how to
get this hair now I did use extensions
from Bellamy and really quickly I do
want to talk to you guys about my
extensions because I get a ton of
questions about my extensions if you
want to skip to the tutorial I'll put
the number right here where you can skip
forward but I'm just gonna go ahead and
inform you about these extensions so the
only ones that I use are the Bellamy
hair extensions 220 gram number two I
like the 22 inch better than the 20
inches just because my hair is so long
that I like it to be a little bit longer
than my natural hair it makes my hair
look a little bit more natural when it's
just a little bit longer so I love the
22 inch I'm in number 2 and you guys
know my hair color is lush cherry from
L'Oreal I'd have a whole haircare
routine video I will link it down below
if you are interested when you get your
extensions you will get a tester which
this is the tester right here when you
get them you don't want to go ahead and
open this if you're questioning your
color you want to look at the tester
first and the tester is just basically a
what is it
is this a 2 clip oh they give you a 2
clip for your tester that's really nice
so if you like your extensions you can
keep the 2 clip because I love the 2
clip extensions so that's awesome I
didn't even know that I would use this
today if I knew but you get a 2 clip
tester extension that looks just like
this as you can see the extension is
very very thick that's one thing I
really do love about these and that's
how I can achieve this really voluminous
hair is with these thick extensions I
have tried some other companies before
and I just was not impressed because
they were super thin and personally I
don't see what the point in buying
extensions is if they're gonna be super
thin because you buy extensions to
either make it look like you have longer
hair or to add a lot of volume to your
hair that's already long so like I said
when you get this just take the tester
out and match it to your hair and see if
it'll go along with it keep in mind if
it's like a little bit off or a little
bit too dark or a little bit too light
it will still kind of blend in mine
actually match my hair pretty perfectly
the only thing that's different is
there's not like a red tint to them but
that's totally fine because as you can
see you can't even tell it all so I love
these even the fine hair fades these
extensions will still match so always
take the tester and try out first
because once you open this you cannot
return the extensions so I would hate
for you to get a color that didn't match
you open this and you can't return this
honestly these really think softest
extensions I've ever tried in my life
this is just a few of the wefts
and you can see how thick they are it's
just a really thick amount of hair you
can't even see me through these
extensions like hello I'm in here
somewhere a lot of you asked me how I
store my extensions and I use a pant
hangers just so they can lay like this
or I'll lay them flat in my Alec store
that I have right beside me but the ones
I'm not using I do hang on a hanger I
just take the clip on the pant hanger
and then like this space in between the
clips I don't clip on the clips I clip
in between and I just clip it right
there so they can hang nicely I highly
recommend them you guys know I've been
wearing these for a months now and I
just I love love love the extensions I
can't say enough good things about it I
haven't had any problems and washing
them by the way I only wash them every
now and then I don't wash them a lot
because it can damage them if you wash
them all the time so maybe like once
every few months I'll wash them if they
get really dirty or something but yeah
so I'll give you one last look these are
the extensions you'll also see another
clip of me done with this hair and I
hope you guys enjoy this
hair tutorial you really want that Lilly
ghalichi look you can get two sets of
the 220 gram and clip the clips to each
other had these two left out of the
whole packet but basically if you really
want that intense thickness just take
the clip clip it to this hair if you had
a bigger pipe it'd be even thicker but
even with just that one clip it's so
much more hair so you could double clip
the extensions if you wanted to really
get her hair I figured you guys like
this I did post a picture on Instagram
the other day and I had a ton of
requests for a tutorial and it was just
Lilly ghalichi inspired honestly so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video please
give it a thumbs up for more hair
tutorials and yeah I will see you guys
in my next video bye okay so the first
thing I'm going to do is section my hair
off and the first place that I'm in
section off is right here cuz simply
take your fingers like this kind of your
section off to this really lower half
so I got this big chunk of hair and you
want about that much section down okay
so I am taking this three clip a rat
Hyup
and I'm going to be putting this in the
back of my head if you want this to last
a little bit longer tease the root of
the section and it will hold a lot
better but personally I found these
extensions that I can click them in and
they last for a long time without
teasing so I'm just going to take the
clip and just clip it right here right
there as close to the root as possible
you can see I already added some nice
hey're
from section right above that you can
see
clip that up again take your 3 clip and
then just put these babies right on in
see this process until you have all your
clips ink is for this hair tutorial you
definitely want to clip in every single
clip so now I'm taking the four clip and
I'm just going to a one fell I'm just
going to apply this again above that
clip now that I have left in the set is
this two-piece clip and three one little
clip like one piece clips so I'm just
going to kind of or actually no for one
piece clips haha one was hiding and I
have this two clip right here and then I
have four one-piece Clips so I'm going
to clip this one on this side of my head
because since I started part my hair
down the middle this sides not as
luminous as a side so I'm just going to
you can put this wherever you want I'm
just gonna section it about wrapped here
and again just clip them in
like that I'm gonna put a one-click
right in here so the one-piece clips
just look like this little bits of hair
some people keep on some people don't I
feel like if you're doing a more
dramatic look it's good to keep them
because they add that extra volume that
you will probably want in the end so
again I'm just taking all this hair over
and I'm gonna clip in two clips and yeah
I got one more clip but honestly there's
like nowhere else for me to clip this so
I'm just gonna put this one aside okay
so this is what the hair looks like the
extensions in now these are a couple
inches longer than my natural hair so
this is what they look like super super
thick okay so now onto the curling part
going to show you guys how I curl it and
it's a little bit of a different
technique I mean it's not like a like a
crazy oh my god that's a so cool
technique but it's a different technique
so I'm going to just section my hair in
a two part 32 clips the little bit that
laughs maybe even three
/ free okay so we still have a ton of
hair here on the bottom so we're going
to section this off usually I don't
section my hair off when I curl my hair
but when you have so much hair and you
want a really Balu - look I definitely
recommend sectioning it off because it's
gonna make a world of difference so
you're gonna make sure you each and
every strand get it curled really nicely
and it's just easier to do so starting
with this side I'm going to take just
this section about this big it's about
an inch thick I'm going to take this
thirty two millimeter wand and what I'm
going to do is I'm just gonna wrap it
I'm not going to lay it down like the
ribbon technique I'm just going to kind
of like roll it around so just like that
and then we're going to hold it for a
few seconds to let it get nice and
curled then let it go and you're left
with like this nice wavy curl now the 32
millimeter one is going to give you
loose waves instead of super tight curls
that's personally what I enjoy you can
do smaller curls if you would like but
today I'm just doing the bigger curls
all over brush it through or anything
like that when you've done a whole
section because we're going to mess with
it when we're done so just continue to
curl and this is pretty self-explanatory
so I'll just let you guys watch look at
that in a cute
okay so we're getting towards the end of
curling this hair now Lily does have a
center part most ugly time I am just
going to keep that so you basically want
to divide each section so you get all
the hairs nice and curled so what I'm
going to do is I just kind of took my
finger back and got this extra hair and
I'm going to clip this on the other side
of my head and I'm gonna work on this
section and just start curling
everything I'm going to keep this bangs
part out I'm gonna do my bangs last but
I'm going to go ahead and just curl
these okay so we've got most of the hair
done now we're just here at the top
layer and what I'm going to do is in
that picture her top layer was pretty
flat so I'm just going to take my top
layer just still doing nice sections I
can get all this hair and I'm just going
to kind of start about four to five
inches down and roll whatever hair I
have now you might have more hair at the
top because mine has been broken off
from when I was blonde so it's getting
longer but it's still not as long as the
rest of my hair so just go about four or
five inches down and then let go and
you'll have like see how it's straight
but get kind of wavy on the end that's
what you want that will help with the
end result so doing the same on this
little going about four to five inches
down again away from your face for me
when I get to the top it's hard to do
the wraparound technique instead of the
ribbon half the time it comes out as a
ribbon so just go with it
and let's see when I get to the bangs
I'm going to do is just brush them out
and probably about two inches down and
want to wrap them so as you can see it's
kind of more flexed my head right now
but we're going to fix that and make it
more voluminous just like Lily's hair so
the first thing we're going to take is
this big sexy hair powder play and we're
just going to put this up in the top of
our roots now we've got extensions all
throughout so it's hard to get your
roots there but here at the top we don't
have any extensions or bangs so we're
just going to put some in there for some
added volume you can you can either put
it on your hands or sprinkle it on
go away works best for you this stuff
makes your hair feel kind of dirty but
that's how you're going to get that
volume we're going to split our hair in
half oh all this hair girlfriend whoo
see look I mean it's already voluminous
even without adding like all this stuff
I'm about to put in here
I'm going to take this baby thickening
dry spun finished spray I don't remember
if you're supposed to shake it up yeah
shake well this is going to add even
more texture and just some more volume
and it kind of makes your hair feel a
bit thicker and texture you can even
focus it more on the root and just
really rub it in there
so now what I'm gonna do I don't feel
the need to really tease much just cuz I
have so much volumizing products but
what I am going to do is kind of smooth
things out so I'm taking a little
teasing comb just running it over the
top I'm not like brushing it I'm just
lightly running it through giving it a
nice smooth finish all over my hair it's
like I still have all of that volume
okay so after you kind of smooth
everything out this is pretty much what
you're going to get that is pretty much
the tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it
