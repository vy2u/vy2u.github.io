sharing with you my current drugstore
favorites and I wanted to do this
because there are certain drugstore
things that I've been using that I
haven't mentioned to you guys and then
it up and that I ever heard that much
about so I wanted to make a video for
you guys because I know when I want to
check out drugstore products I really
like to see reviews first because most
drugstores don't have like swatching
thingies or anything like that so I
can't even think of what it's called Oh
most drugstores don't have testers the
way you kids watch the reviews are super
helpful and that's why I wanted to make
this for you guys because I want it to
be really helpful for you guys and let
you know what I've truly been loving
from the drugstore because drugstores
can also be a hit and miss kind of thing
don't forget to give this video a thumbs
up if you liked it again you guys have
been so amazing with the thumbs ups so
thank you so much and before this video
get started if you can just think of one
drugstore favorite that you love let me
know in the comments right now write it
before I even get started and see if we
have some similar favorites I think
that'd be awesome so yeah if you want to
see some of my drugstore where my
favorites then let's just get started ok
so the first one is actually by
covergirl this is a covergirl clean
oil-control pressed powder in medium
light I don't think I've ever mentioned
this before but I've used this a lot I
just use this as a blotting powder and I
really like it because it really
mattifies your face without looking
cakey or anything like that it's a nice
smooth powder it's not too intense like
a ton of product doesn't come off on
your hand like when you swatch it but
that's what I like about it just a
really lightweight powder just to go
ahead and quickly mattify you and not
look too cakey over your makeup so again
this is a covergirl clean oil control
pressed powder and I'm in the shade
medium light this video is probably
going to go in a random order so I'm
sorry but this is another product I've
been loving I believe I mentioned this
in my last favorites video but this is a
NYX CC cream and this is the green one
for redness and I like this a lot like
it is so good it does counteract some of
my redness it doesn't always take it
completely away but I just love the
formula of this because it makes my skin
really
smooth and my foundation just glides on
I just love the formula it's been a
really long time since I've found a
primer at the drugstore that I like or
CC cream I don't even know if I have a
primer that I like yeah I did I liked
the boost number-7 mattifying primer but
right now that's a little too magnifying
for me it just dries my skin out a
little bit too much so this one is
perfect
I love it with all of my foundations I
just think it's the bomb and they also
have other types too so if you don't
have redness and you have like dry skin
they have some for you as well so I
quickly want to mention this and mainly
because I know some of you probably be
like there was like no foundations in
this video which it's true there's only
one foundation from the drugstore that I
like right now I've tried a few and I
just I don't like a lot of the drugstore
foundations they just don't look good on
my skin I have very sensitive skin you
don't know I do have some rosacea and a
lot of drugstore foundations break my
skin out like crazy but the one that I
do like and then I'm going to mention to
you guys that you've probably seen a
million times on my channel is just a
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte if you have
very sensitive skin or you know things
you want to cover up I think you would
really like this a lot because this is
one of the foundations that doesn't
break me out I used to love the
covergirl 3 in one as well but that
started oxidizing on me like crazy and
just look like super crazy on my skin
but this one is great I like it a lot I
like it with a Beauty Blender I like
with the brush I feel like a brush
blends it out a lot better so that's
personally how I apply it and it is a
medium to full coverage of foundations
let's move on to brows I actually have
this on my brows right now and I'm not
going to lie I really didn't have like
it that high hopes for this my first
bought it and I feel like I showed this
in a haul forever ago but this is deep
Revlon brow fantasy by color stay in
brunette I like this a lot
the only thing I will say is I wish I
had a spoon family comes out sitting
here with this like going and then I
have my spoolie in my other hand so I
was just like multitasking but I can
deal with not having a spoolie on this I
just think this is awesome this is a
very pigmented pencil so you want to
make sure you have a light hand with it
like you might think oh that's not
primitive
mm-hmm it is girl you if you press hard
on your brows you will have like sharpie
and instead I also like the cat that it
clicks and closes so even though it is a
plastic cat it's not going to just
randomly come off I love that a lot and
I do like the gel as well the gel is
really nice it doesn't feel crunchy or
anything like that it just smooths down
the hairs kind of fills in any extra
little spaces you forgot because it is
tinted and it does keep my brows in
place so yeah so yeah that is the brow
fantasy from Revlon ok I want I want to
talk about this mascara because I loved
the L'Oreal miss manga mascara the
original purple - I decided to try this
one out because I was like miss manga
rock ok I see you so yeah I love this
one too I just feel like it gives my
lashes such amazing volume so when I
first saw this brush I was like I don't
think I'm gonna like that because the
bristles are so short and there's a lot
of product on there but it really
separates my lashes makes them really
nice and long and super thick I've just
had a really good experience with the
miss manga line from L'Oreal I feel like
L'Oreal really kills it but their
mascaras like they know what they're
doing so this is just another hit for me
I really love it a lot and it's super
black which is awesome ok next up is
eyeshadow this NYX Avant pop palette is
literally all you need in your life and
it's the most amazing thing ever I know
some people get so sick of others
mentioning mix but NYX is at Ulta and
it's affordable so I consider a
drugstore but this palette is all like
if I was just starting out with makeup
this would be deep hell that I would go
again because you have everything
because you have the smokey shades right
here to do a smokey eye you have a great
transition shade great darker colors to
put in the outer V you have a matte
cream you can happy use to highlight and
then you have like another shimmery
shade I mean this is just like the
perfect palette I mean it's beautiful
it's very very very pigmented let me
show you this green
I love this green like stop and then
this is the matte Brown like honestly
you guys all the shades in this palette
are intense and pigmented and blend out
so well definitely give it a go this one
is the no boo chic I don't know but it's
the most neutral palette that they have
ok moving
to blush this is a Paula do blushed I'm
saying that wrong please let me know in
the comments because I feel like I'm
always saying it wrong what I mentioned
in videos but this is their matte brush
their matte blush in toasted apricot and
I like this it's a little bit more pink
I would expect an apricot shade to be a
little bit more on the orange a warm
side but for me it's definitely more
pink it's coming up on camera a little
bit warm to me it looks more rosy I
might be crazy I have it on today
you probably can't see it cuz I've
blended it like crazy but this is a very
pigmented blush oh I just did that right
this watch I hope the brown so this is a
very pigmented blush but like I said it
does blend out really easily so that's
it right there it's very smooth and
looks really great on the skin and I
definitely want to pick up more blushes
from this brand because I was really
impressed by it I'm staying for face I
just have to mention this I know I've
mentioned the elf contour palette and a
blush palette to you guys both the light
in the dark shades are phenomenal but
this is the bronzer palette and I like
this I have this actually an eyeshadow
today and you can use this for bronzer
you can use it for blush because you do
have some shimmery shades in here you
can use it for whatever you want to do
but right now I have this shade all over
my lid and this shade in my crease just
give that perfect warm eye you know it's
just warm I want to mention this NYX
two-timer pencil liner and then felt tip
liner it's obviously a two and one I
haven't used the felt tip in so long
mine's kind of just dried out right now
that's it right there but I love the
kohl liner because this does not run on
my eyes so that is it right there it's
not the blackest of blacks but I like
the fact that it adds enough darkness to
you know look like it's black but it
doesn't smudge everywhere that's like
the most important part to me because I
have a really watery eyes I have oily
legs I mean just all of the above it's
just it will run on me in an instant
but this does not do that I love it to
tight line like line my upper lash line
and also line my lower
our line and the real test is obviously
on the lower water line and this works
so well like I said I don't really use
the felt tip much but the cold wire on
this is amazing and I think it's cool
that you have a two in one product all
right let's talk about some lip products
the first thing I want to quickly
mention our two lip liners this one's
again from that palette do brand you can
get this friend at Ulta if you're
wondering and this is their herbal lip
liner in naked and I use this and like I
swear every tutorial and I just broke
the tip of it
good job Casey that's it right there
it's a gorgeous Mavi nude it's stunning
it literally goes with everything and
even if it doesn't go with the lip
product I still use it because I just
want to line my lips and then usually
that lip color will go over it because I
did line my lips with this day but you
can't see it right and then essence
kills it with their lip liners again you
can get this at Ulta I don't know about
anywhere else I haven't seen them but
this is in soft berry and this is just
so pretty I need a sharpener but I have
used this for a really long time again
this is like a ma B taupe shade it's a
lot more pigmented than that but I'm
scraping it on my hand so that's what
we're working with but it is beautiful
very very very creamy very easy to work
with I just love it a lot
so good so check out essence for some
lip liners I think they're like 2 bucks
or something they're amazing last but
not least our lip products and the first
one I want to talk about is this revlon
colorburst matte balm this is in the
shade I hate when they do this to me oh
there it is
this is in 225 sultry this is a great
matte lip balm and what I like about it
is the smell it's kind of a minty smell
it's oh it smells like a fake mint which
probably doesn't make any sense but it
smells like a fake mint smell and
doesn't smell like Romans you know what
I'm saying
but it still smells really good it's
really gorgeous and pigmented and it is
matte but it's a creamy matte so it's
not going to dry out your lips and I
love that I did try out these Revlon
Ultra HD matte lip colors the some
melodies makes me want to vomit
it reminds me of something that I like a
medicine I used to take when I was a kid
and I
like the colors and the applicators of
these are phenomenal packaging colors
applicators and the actual product is
really nice I cannot get past the smell
I literally want to throw up every time
I wear it so I'm really sad about that
but if those bends but if those have the
same like smell as these I would be all
over it but they don't so okay now the
last two lip products are from the NYX
liquid suede liquid suede line though
NYX killed it with these you guys they
killed it so good oh my gosh I love them
I can't get my life together I really
can't so the first one I have been using
a ton is this one in a sandstorm
I love the applicator of these oh
they're so pigmented so it's a liquid
suede lipstick is not matte so it comes
off more creamy and glossy but it does
dry to a suede texture and I really like
that because again it doesn't drop at
your lips or anything and then this
color has also been like my obsession
and it's so beautiful this is in the
shade vintage and this is such an
amazing like fall winter color and when
this dries oh it's even more beautiful
oh I just I love these two so vintage
and sandstorm love these I love this
whole line go check it out you'll
probably find the color you love because
they have a ton of colors but these two
right now are the ones I'm using the
most okay guys so that's it for this
drugstore favorites video I hope you
enjoyed it if you did please give it a
thumbs up I tried to not repeat anything
in like past drugstore favorites videos
the only thing I've possibly repeated is
this infallible foundation but it's just
it's so good I can't get away from it so
I hope you guys enjoyed it please let me
know some of your favorites down in the
comments below I would love to know
