current dress or favorites I have quite
a bit of stuff to show you guys so I'm
gonna try to go through this video but I
haven't really done a video just
dedicated to drugstore stuff in a while
and you guys know that I do love
drugstore I know I mentioned a lot of
high-end things but I still am in love
with drugstore I'm gonna show you guys
what I've been loving and yeah let's go
ahead and just get started the first
thing is this covergirl Olay simply
ageless corrector I've actually talked
about this a lot it is one of my
all-time favorite things from the
drugstore and it excuse my pinkie right
here I've had no problems but it comes
with a swirl of the corrector and like
the old lame moisturizer and this is
amazing I showed it in my updated
foundation routine it's just amazing and
it really does just correct underneath
my eyes and brighten up my eyes and it's
just amazing I swear to you this is like
the best thing from the drugstore I feel
like for underneath the eye is because
it just really helped correct mine at
least and I truly truly truly loved it
moving on is I'm not going in any
particular order by the way I just kind
of have a mountain right here I have
these half lashes any kind of half
lashes I'm really not picky like I have
some from aundrea and then Ardell it's
I'm not picky about my half lashes just
as long as they're half and I really
like them they're super easy to apply if
you're a beginner then I definitely
recommend half lashes because they're a
great way to kind of learn how to put on
your lashes and you know where you need
to kind of place them so I highly
recommend half lashes and I feel like
they give that extra flare to the outer
half of your eyes so it looks a little
bit more sexy and sultry is a repurchase
that I've done this is the Maybelline
Dream matte powder this is awesome I
feel like it's one of the best drugstore
powders along with another one that I
have in this video but this is flawless
it never looks cakey it's so amazing for
oily skin this is what I use as like my
blotting powder just to touch up my face
throughout the day so this is always in
my purse
I have it in the color medium oh one oh
and if you're wondering about hot
flashes and even tell you the name this
is 305 by Ardell and then the 301 from
aundrea next is a brow powder actually
have this on today it's the Milani
graphics kit this is in medium I do
believe but that's just what it looks
like today I have the darkest color on I
was doing the brow one I decided to just
go with a darker color today and I'm
actually really loving it so this is the
one I have on and it comes with like
this amazing little brush I've been
using this so much lately and like it's
so convenient it's so tiny and I just
use this to fill in my brows all the
time but I feel like this is a great
brow kit if you're just starting out or
something and kind of want to experiment
with different colors has a highlight
color and then a lighter brow color and
then a darker brown color next is I
think this is discontinued but I saw it
not too long ago so I'm gonna try to see
if I could find this on the site because
I know some sites then I'm going to
mention different products in they have
discontinued stuff so I'm gonna search
this for you guys but I love this
palette I have it on my eyes today this
is the maybelline eye studio quad and
cozy cashmere this came out like in the
fall in the beginning of fall I do
believe and these colors are just you
too full I really can't get over them I
did a clubbing kind of night out video
with this if you want to see it I'll put
the link in the bottom bar but I love
this quad I think it's one of the best
it's very comparable to Mac shadows I
feel like I feel like they should make
this permanent because it's just amazing
next is something I've talked about
quite a bit from the drugstore this is a
L'Oreal hip high intensity pigments
eyeliner I use this all the time it's
one of my go-to liners it never smudges
on my waterline I have a really hard
time finding liners that don't smudge
because my eyes can get like a little
bit watery and then they'll just start
sliding down the sides of my eye but
this one does not do that which is why I
love it I think I got this on sale as
well and it's just very pigmented and it
just looks really nice on the eyes so I
just mainly love us because it doesn't
just glide off my eye X is this Revlon
Photoready baby
oh my gosh I love this I'm supposed to
do it FIF update for January and I
promise you I might just include it with
the February because I am so behind on
videos and trying to catch up I love
this product I actually keep these in my
purse just in case I you know and
somewhere and I forget to put face
makeup on if I just don't feel like it
then I'll apply this and I even do it on
the go because I feel like if I'm
applying a BB cream I always have my
dream matte powder in my purse as well
so I'll just apply this top it off with
this and I'll be good to go for my face
so I like cooking this in my purse just
on a go because I feel like many creams
you don't have to think about them you
just put them on and that's what makes
them great this isn't like full coverage
or anything like that but it does even
out my skin tone and that's why I really
love this product I use it a lot for
work next is actually something I did at
FIF um but I've really been loving it
and I've used it today and my eyelashes
look false see L'Oreal telescopic
shocking extensions mascara I will put
my FIF video somewhere in here I'll
probably just link it but this is an
amazing mascara I love it a lot more
than the original because it's literally
everything I wanted into mascara in one
two volumizing lengthening it separates
it's just gorgeous I cannot stress
enough how awesome this mascara is and I
don't know I don't know what I'm going
to do with my other mascaras now because
this has everything I want and usually I
combine other mascaras to give me the
lashes that I need but this just does it
for me so that's really amazing ok next
is this NYC smooth skin a sunny bronzer
I actually have this on today and I
really love it this is another product
that I like too sorry get it open this
is another product that I like to keep
in my purse it's just a nice bronzer to
touch up with I have it on today
actually and I really like it I think it
looks really great on kind of medium to
a little bit lighter skin tones I don't
know if you're super super darker this
will show up but it's just a great
bronzer and I like to touch up
throughout the day with this so the next
thing I'm loving is this NYX the curved
eyeliner I did and if I have video on
this as well and I was not
pest bite when I first tried it out I
will say that it was kind of
disappointed but I've been using it like
crazy I haven't used another liquid
liner this is the only one I've been
using and I've gotten used to it and I
actually really love it I don't know if
I'd repurchase it because it is $15 and
I feel like there's other alternatives
that are cheaper but since I did
purchased it I you know continue to use
it and I actually really love this
eyeliner so if you're looking just to
try something out and you don't really
care about the price then I would
recommend this next is a Revlon
individual shadow I don't know if they
still have this I would think they would
but I've had this for literally years
and it's just a great color to have in
your collection because you always need
a matte highlight this is the revlon
matte shadow and it's in peach sorbet
and that's what it looks like it's just
a really nice matte shadow to highlight
with I highlighted with it today and it
just looks really great on my eyes very
pigmented and it's not too white or
creamy or anything it's just that
perfect matte highlight next is a
foundation my new a favorite drugstore
foundation I've actually been using this
for a while now I just didn't really
talk about it for some reason so this is
a covergirl clean foundation and this is
just what it looks like it's the one
with all the blue packaging I do believe
the clean line from covergirl is for
oily skin yes because it says oil
control on it but this one's in soft
honey I have another color as well from
when I'm lighter but I have this on
today and I love the finish especially
using it with my Beauty Blender it's
beautiful and I highly recommend this
product because it's just amazing and if
you have oily skin this is something I
would definitely try it's a lot lighter
than the Revlon Colorstay it's kind of
thick in the jar but once you apply to
your face it just feels really good and
I don't feel like I have foundation on
next it's a concealer this is the
Maybelline mineral power concealer I
have had this for a while and I just
kind of went back to it and this isn't
the color cream like for five and I love
this to top off my corrector just to
have like a skin tone color on top of
there this is awesome it covers very
well and you can also use this without
the corrector and it would still covered
very nicely it is a wet and wild vanity
palette
uh I cannot get over this palette I love
it so much I've mentioned it a lot
lately because I've just been going back
to it and just really loving it so this
is what it looks like it's the perfect
palette to have and I feel like this
color is so similar to naked it's a
little bit darker but it's still the
perfect crease color these were the best
palate they ever came out with not even
lying next to this Revlon nearly naked
powder this is a medium and okay I like
the packaging of this it's a nice like
fine powder so it doesn't look cakey on
the skin at all and I actually like this
to set my foundation with so that's what
it looks like I feel like the colors are
really kind of darker I was looking at
the light color like the light powder
and then the medium powder and I
couldn't decide which one I wanted
because I didn't know how it would turn
out but this medium powder worked out
really well for me and I just really
like it's nice and soft and buttery it
just looks really really great and then
next to last thing is this Milani baked
blush this is in Luminoso so this is
what that blush looks like these baked
blushes remind me so much of the mac
mineralized blushes it's insane but that
is Luminoso right there it is beautiful
and I really really love this color I
have it on today as well just a nice
kind of peachy color it looked really
really really great with a tan so I like
this one a lot so the last favorites are
these maybelline color vivid
or these Maybelline vivid collection
lipsticks I want to get more I have the
color hot plum which was like this and
then I also have the shocking coral
color which just looks like that and
then this one's my all-time favorite
this is fuchsia flash which is like a
Barbie pink color I use this in my
Valentine's Day makeup tutorial than i
link in this video but this is gorgeous
I feel like I have to spice them up a
little bit with highlighting and all my
lips and lip gloss but once you do those
little extra steps it looks really
beautiful so this one shocking coral hot
plum and if you should flash I do
believe it was official flash yes
fuchsia flash that is all my drugstore
favorites at the
there are some new products in here and
some old products I really just
completely loved and continued to use so
if you have a favorite drugstore product
then let me know what it is down below
in the comments I would love to hear it
and try some new things out as well so
yes thank you guys so much for watching
and don't forget to like the video if
you liked it I'll see you guys my next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
