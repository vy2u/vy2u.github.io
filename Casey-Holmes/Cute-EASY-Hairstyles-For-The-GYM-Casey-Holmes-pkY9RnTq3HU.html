a few I didn't even count how many
because I lost count and then my camera
shot off so I'm afraid some of the
footage got deleted my camera's been
doing that so let's pray it didn't but I
did some hairstyles for you guys they're
really cute and easy to do and just
something to do for the gym all of these
are ways to get your hair out of your
face and I also show you guys a
hairstyle that I like to do when I wear
it in a ponytail just so I'm like not as
self-conscious about my forehead so I
show you a little tip and trick and that
I mean I don't have to be just for the
gym you can do it for any day of the
week if you're being lazy don't want to
do your hair and few hairs really oily
or something do these hair cells and
they are so cute I love them and yeah so
by the way if you guys see some
scratches on me like right here and
across my neck
I took Daisy into the pool with me today
and she was like calling a bee that's
where all the scratches are from but I
hope you guys enjoyed this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and share
it I will leave some links down below we
can share this video I would love your
support and don't forget to subscribe so
you don't miss out on any of my videos
and if you want to see a few of these
awesome gym hairstyles then let's just
get started okay so this first hairstyle
is really cute I actually found this one
on Pinterest but I also did add a braid
to it so if you wanted to you could
leave it like this or you could add a
braid just to kind of make it a little
bit more girly so my hair is just
freshly blow-dried and I'm going to
section my hair off and I'm going to do
a top section and I'm going to use
little rubber band type of elastics to
tie it in place and then what we're
going to do is we're going to section
off the middle of our hair and we're
going to do the same exact thing and tie
it with an elastic and then of course
you're going to take the remaining hair
that you have and take an elastic and
tie that up as well
you
then what you're gonna want to do is
flip it all back over and then put a
little hole in the first section that
you did now you're going to do is push
that hair through that hole just looping
it and make sure you pull all of the
hair through and it's going to create
like this really cool twisted look I
don't know it's really cool so you're
gonna do the same thing with the next
section you're just going to make a
little hole and then flip that hair
through it and you're also going to take
the hair in the first section and put
that through the hole as well I hope
this is making sense it's really easy
once you start doing it but you'll see
right here this is kind of what it's
forming just some little pretty loop
things I don't know what you would call
it so you just wanted the same thing for
the last section of hair just loop that
hair through and then take the remaining
of the hair and it put it through that
hole
and then you could just leave it like
this but I'm going to go ahead and
tighten up the elastics and I will also
be spreading out the hair a little bit
and it kind of gives it a bubbled look
when you start tying up the elastics and
I love the way it looks is kind of like
a faux hawk in a way I don't know it's
really cool so you could leave it like
this if you want to which i think is
super super cute and it gets all the
hair out of your face or you could also
take the section on the bottom and braid
that as well if you didn't want all the
hair to be out in the open so I'm just
going to take that hair and just braid
it per usual doing nothing crazy
and then you're going to want to pull at
the braid make it a little bigger nice
and messy and then you'll be done with
this hairstyle
now onto hairstyle - this one's a little
bit different a lot of going on but I
like it you can always just switch it up
to however you want so I'm going to
leave that top section like we had up
where we looped it through and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to French
braid the side of my head I am NOT the
most talented French brighter in the
world so it takes me a hot minute to
braid but once I get it I'm good to go
and all you're going to do is just
French braid it to about the edge of
your head you don't want to go all the
way back you'll see right here I'm about
to end it and then you're just going to
want to finish off the braid so don't
forget it all the way to the back like
at the nape of your neck just French
braid it till about where that top
section is and then go ahead and start
doing a regular braid and then again
you're just going to want to pull up the
braids and make it loose and big and
this really makes the look I feel like
when you pull the braids out and really
just give it a lot of volume I just I
love the way it looks so I'm going to do
it the same exact thing to the other
side as well
and I just fast forward it for you
because um yeah it took me a minute
so after you've got that done you want
to turn around and take those two braids
and you want to basically like tie them
together so you're just going to loop
one over the other and pull tight and
then you're going to take the rest of
your hair and you're going to take an
elastic like this and you just want to
twist the hair all together just keep
twisting until it forms a little bun and
then you're just going to tie it with
your hair bow and you are good you can
also just go back in and kind of pull
things out and you know tuck in pull
different places I mean it's all trial
and error so feel free to tug a little
bit and you can see how there's like a
little bubble in the back I really like
that as well I thought it was super cute
and it's just different you know what I
mean you don't see stuff like this
next I'm going to show you the ponytail
that I like to do when I'm feeling
self-conscious about my forehead and you
know what the struggle is we're all real
oh my gosh the struggle is real it just
it just happens so this is really easy
you're just going to take your hair hair
oh my god I can't talk so you just want
to take your bangs in the front of your
face whatever bangs you have or your
side part just take that in the front
and then you want to put your hair back
in a regular ponytail like you would
normally do and this is just my ponytail
I like to do a really kind of loose
ponytail in a way it is pretty tight but
it's nothing like really intense and
slicked back so then I like to just pull
at the pieces and give it some more
volume and then I'm going to take the
bang or the side part and I'm going to
kind of drape it over the side of my
forehead so you can see it just covered
up the forehead a little bit and then
you want to tuck in the ends in the
rubber band and this does stay
throughout your workout I a hundred
percent no it does because I do this
almost every single day um so it's just
a way to keep your side part or your
fringe in front of your face if it's
long enough to fit into the rubber band
if not you can always use bobby pins but
this is just what I like to do to still
kind of have a side part but have the
really pretty pony as well so I like
this this one's my most used and you can
also just tousle your hair a little bit
to make it a little more messy and
you're good to go
this one's my favorite I'm not always a
huge fan of pigtails but I think these
look badass
so what you're going to do is you're
just going to take the front section of
your hair and we're going to do twists
so if you're not a good writer this
would be a great option for you because
you don't have to braid anything you're
just going to twist your hair and you
want to go away from your face so as you
go down it's kind of like French
braiding but with twists so as you go
down the side of your head you just want
to add more hair twist back add a little
bit more hair twist back and just keep
that going and you're just going to do
this till you get most the hair on the
side of your face and then you're just
going to want to pull it back into a
pigtail
so you can see I've got all of the hair
on the side of my face there and then
I'm just going to roughly split it in
half like the part or whatever and then
I'm going to put it into a pigtail and
like I said I'm not usually into
pigtails but these are damn cute and I
did have a clip where I braided the rest
of the hair but that's what got deleted
so I'm so sorry it was really really
cute though if you try it out and you
pull out your braids oh it's so stunning
so I'm going to do the same exact thing
on the other side tie it in place and
then you kind of have these badass
ponytails or just so fun you can just
pull some hair out and you know create
some more volume and I think they look
really cute
I think all we're going to do this
really easy braid with a messy bun and
all you're going to do is do a deeper
side part so I'm just going to take some
more hair over on the other side and
then you're just going to do the classic
French braid again if you don't know how
to do this you can always look up some
videos on it it takes some practice
trust me it takes a lot of practice but
once you get it down you're pretty much
set so I did braid just a little bit of
it and then I'm pulling all of it back
and I'm just wrapping my hair around
itself creating the most insanely messy
bun ever when you could have messy buns
they're not always as effortless as it
looks so you might have to go back and
tuck a few things and you know fix a few
hairs but then what I also did is I
pulled out my braids a little bit just
to give it more volume and then of
course let some hair down and then this
was the finished looked really easy and
it looks like you took forever on it but
you didn't and then last but not least
is my go to messy bun top knot I've had
so many questions on this so I'm going
to show you how now I just pull my hair
up and a high pony and then again I'm
just wrapping my hair around itself it's
basically like a top knot you just twist
it and wrap it around the south all at
the same time then you're going to tie
it in place with the hair tie and then
pull out your hair don't be afraid to
really loosen the hair on your scalp and
you are done so I hope you guys enjoyed
