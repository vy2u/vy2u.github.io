with you this get ready with me / date
night makeup tutorial Davis at the
beginning of the week that I really
wanted to go out on a date where we get
dressed up and just you know go into the
city and all that so tonight is a night
where we're doing that bigger I would do
it get ready with me and show you guys
just how I got ready I thought it'd be
fun I love getting super glammed up and
going out and I'm also showing you guys
some different products in this video so
I hope you enjoyed that as well as I did
my hair and makeup in this video and if
you guys want to see how I got this
complete look then let's just go ahead
and get started okay so starting off as
always I'm using my NARS eyeshadow
primer to prime my lids and get it ready
for eyeshadow and then we're going in
with this wise art palette I guess it's
called but we're also using the Too
Faced power of makeup collab with
nikkietutorials this palette is awesome
I'm going to be taking the shade ivy I'm
going to put this all over my lid just
to have a nice base for the rest of the
eyeshadows that we're going to put on
since the other palette that I have does
not have a cream shade I just wanted to
reach into this palette and use this
color
moving on we're going to take this shade
right here which is a nice light brown
and we're going to put this into the
crease this isn't a unnecessary step
after I started using the other palette
I realized I really didn't have to do
this but I went ahead and did it so I
figured I would show you guys going into
this Pat I'm going to take this orange
and I'm going to blend this into a my
crease as well this palette is very very
pigmented and it has beautiful colors in
it like I said it's kind of a bummer
that it doesn't have a cream shade but I
can look past that because I do have
other cream shades that I can use but
these eyeshadows blend so beautifully it
is a really expensive palette but so far
I think it is worth the money then I'm
going to take this shade right here and
I'm going to put this in the outer V and
work it into my crease I do build this
color up I start out with a light layer
and then I just build it up to how deep
I wanted to be and I did build it up a
lot so it was pretty deep because I love
a smoky look you guys know this so yeah
I'm just gonna go ahead and build this
up and let you guys watch it
next up I'm going to take the greens and
the pallet I just decided to mix both of
them it really doesn't matter you can
use whatever one you want and I put them
on the inner part of my lid and just
blended it back towards that burgundy
shade and I love the green at first I
didn't think I would like it but I ended
up really enjoying it it's just so warm
and pretty and I was wearing a black
dress so I could kind of do whatever I
wanted with my eyeshadow so going back
in with that other shade we just use I'm
going to blend out the green going in
with that orange again I'm going to
touch-up that crease shade and just
really blend this out and I liked that I
did this because it made the orange pop
even more it just looks like a warm
forest look I'm obsessed with it so I
just pop that into the crease again and
then I'm going to do a winged eyeliner
you guys have seen me do this so many
times but this makeup forever one is my
favorite at the moment and it has been
for a very long time then I'm taking the
flutter lashes in Shayla and then I'm
going to take this concealer I can't
remember what it's called but I will
leave it down below it's a high end
concealer that I am trying for you guys
but I am first priming my face with a
Smashbox primer water and I'm going to
be using a powder foundation today so
I'm going to apply my concealer first
and I'm just putting this underneath my
eyes and blending it out with a Beauty
Blender this does have really great
coverage and even though it is a cream
concealer usually these stick cream
concealers don't work out very well for
me but this actually was really nice and
it did increase into my fine lines this
will be in my luxury makeup haul so you
guys will see it very soon taking this
law Prarie powder foundation I'm
obsessed with this you guys I mean the
coverage is just amazing you want to see
a more in depth video and review I will
leave that video down below it's where I
test it out for hundred dollars worth of
products this is one thing I highly
suggest you guys I just think it's so
amazing the coverage is just phenomenal
and it looks beautiful on the skin so
I'm just applying now over the only
thing that sucks is the shade range they
don't really have a
shades so like with this one I just have
to bronze it up so for that many uses
bareMinerals bronzer this is a
discontinued bronzer but it's one of my
favorites so I wanted to use it I am
using this brush from Tom Ford which
again I am trying out for you guys to
see if it's worth the money or not when
I do that haul I'll have reviews with
everything
next up I'm taking the benefit hoola
bronzer and I'm just going to contour my
face with this I have been reaching for
my NARS
eita brush more lately and I forgot how
much I loved it so I'm just going to be
contouring with that and then using an
artiste brush to contour my nose and
this again would be in that luxury haul
I use this video to really test out some
more products so lots of new stuff in
this video it's really exciting
so for brows I guess I'm skipping blush
right now I'm using this Cobra product
from benefit and I went ahead and
applied that took me forever to do my
brows so I figured out just skip that
part but that's what I use and then I'm
using this you found sheet eyeliner for
my waterline
it is so freakin black you guys it's
insane and then for my blush I used
Tarte force K and then highlighter this
was another product featured in that
$400 product video and this is the
highlighter from door it's amazing it's
so gorgeous yes you could get lower end
highlighters and it'll look just as
beautiful but I can't help it I just I'm
obsessed with it and they also use this
underneath my brows sometimes I do this
I just love the way it looks when I
match the highlighter on my cheeks to
what's underneath my brow bone I feel
like it just sinks together really
nicely then I'm going to take that
burgundy shade again and press this up
against that lower lash line and really
get it in there to smoke out this look
and then we're going to be going with
the orange shade and blending out that
color just so it's smoky but blended and
it doesn't look too harsh underneath the
lower lash line
after that we're going to apply my scare
I'm just using a benefit roller lash
just one my favorite mascaras that I've
been using for a while then I'm going on
this Palladio lip liner in salmon and
I'm going to line my lips and then we're
going to be using these new lorac liquid
lipsticks these are coming out very soon
I believe in September I think it's the
19th I did get these in a PR package and
I really like them you guys again the
smashbox does have my favorite formula
but these are amazing and they have
really gorgeous colors so i highly
recommend checking them out the formula
was really nice it lasted all night
there just a little bit more drying than
these smashbox ones so that's why I
recommend the Smashbox formula over this
going in with my favorite dry shampoo
this is a batiste dry shampoo for
brunettes best dry shampoo by far I mean
I've been using this for so long I can't
even tell you how many cans I've gone
through and then I'm going to brush out
my hair and put in my extensions I
wanted to go all out this night so
putting in my extensions were definitely
a must-have these are my foxy locks
extensions and they're 280 grams in the
shade honey spice and they match my hair
perfectly right now since I'm doing that
balayage ombre look and I love these
because they make my hair look a little
bit lighter but I love the thickness
that they add to my hair it really
completes a dramatic smoky look I just
love it I wear these all the time
if you even watched me for a while you
know if I'm wearing foxy locks for
almost a year now I'm really obsessed
with them great quality
I usually don't curl them again but in
this video I did curl them because I
wanted a little bit tighter curls so I
wanted them to match the curls that I
was doing for my hair but I put in about
five wess and then I'm just going to
start curling my hair so if you guys
also want to check out these extensions
I will leave a link for them down below
with a little code where you can get a
free gift at checkout
I have shown you guys so many times how
I curl my hair so I'm just going to
quickly show you in this video one thing
I have been doing differently is taking
the crown of my head and taking that
hair teasing it and then curling it and
Bobby pinning it and I do this first so
that these curls can cool and I have a
lot of body at the top of the head so
you can see I'm taking the curl out and
then I'm going to take a long bobby pin
and just pin that in place and then I
will do the rest of my hair I do have
one more layer to do right here but I go
ahead and curl that and again bobby pin
it and I feel like this makes the
biggest difference it gives you so much
volume I'm obsessed I am using in the
new me thirty two millimeter one I have
used new me for years like ever since I
started YouTube and I just don't switch
from them because they're my favorite
and I stand by them so if you guys won't
coupon codes for any of their products I
will leave it down below don't buy
anything for price it's just always some
money not a waste of money but like why
buy something full price when you have
good coupons right for the rest of my
hair I just did alternating curls like I
always do I don't section them all for
anything I do the front pieces away from
my face and then I alter the rest so
I'll do some pieces away from my face
and towards my face then I put
everything down you can just see how
much volume this has and I like to brush
up my curls so I go ahead and brush them
out to just loosen them up and then this
is what the back looks like and it does
kind of fall throughout the night so
that's my favorite part and then that is
the completed look so I hope you guys
enjoyed this please give them a thumbs
up if you did thank you so much for
watching and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
