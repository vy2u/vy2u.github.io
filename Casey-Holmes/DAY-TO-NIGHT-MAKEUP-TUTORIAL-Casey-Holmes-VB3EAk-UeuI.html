very exciting video because first off
it's my first day to night makeup
tutorial I believe I think it is I've
been meaning to do this forever
because I figured I would show you guys
kind of like how I would take my makeup
from day to night it's very convenient
if you're you know busy all day and you
just want to amp up your makeup for a
night out this is the perfect video for
you be showing you some different
products in this video as well and
another thing I'm very excited about is
I did a partner up with NARS because if
you don't know they are coming out with
two brand new highlighting pellets these
are going to be exclusive to Nordstrom
and available on a March 1st but if
you're watching this video coming from
my channel you're able to actually shop
this right now so you get to shop in a
few days early which i think is awesome
and amazing that they allowed my viewers
to go ahead and purchase this early so
I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys
these pallets up close this first one is
a reveille Soleil so this color right
here is a warm gold with a pearl finish
this one's a soft peak shimmer and then
this gorgeous one right here is a
metallic rose gold and then this one
with the darker tones in it is coucher
de soleil so here's a really pretty look
at this one the very far right color is
a golden bronze shimmer then you have a
rose shimmer in the middle and then on
the left you have a mauve these are the
two palettes in my light so you can
really see them they are so gorgeous you
can use them wet or dry however you
prefer you could use these on your body
your face you can use them for your
Cupid's bow highlight underneath your
brows so if you are interested I will
leave a link down below I recommend
checking it out I will be using these in
the videos watching them all of that so
yeah it's not so exciting I feel so
special that I get to announces to you
guys and have you shop at first I just
think it's so fun so with that being
said we're gonna go ahead and get
started with this day to night makeup I
don't know I already snapped so with
that being said we're gonna go ahead and
get started with this day it tonight
makeup look you're not subscribed
already definitely be sure to hit that
subscribe button before you leave and
turn on your post notifications you want
to see this day to night makeup look
then let's just go ahead and get started
alright guys so the first thing that
we're going to do is prime our eyes I'm
gonna use this from cover
this is new and I've been really
interested to try it it's the lid lock
up eyes shadow primer oh this says it
preps lids for all day wear all day
crease proof shadow security maximize
the wear and intensity of your shadow
dries quickly perfect I'm excited to see
if this has like a tint to it but the
packaging is really pretty all the cover
girls new packaging is like really amped
up and awesome so I really like that all
it does have a tint
let's just see what you got here so this
isn't really going to cancel out
darkness or redness anything like that
but it is setting pretty quickly so my
date night makeup looks are pretty easy
I do pretty much the same day it looks
and then I just incorporate different
things to make it into night this is
perfect if you'll have time to take off
all your makeup that you wore throughout
the day like if you're going from work
to night out what really is most
important is having primers and having
long wearing products it's just really
important to focus on the base products
and have long wearing products products
you know that are going to last a while
and then kind of just building on top of
that so then when you go in for a night
out you can just add a few things here
and there to your eyes and to your lips
and be good to go first thing we're
going to do is use different eyeshadows
today I have two different brands we
have the balm meet matrimony right here
which just has a lot of really great
matte eyeshadows I've used this a few
times on my channel and I love it and
then we also have this dose of colors
sassy cns palette which i think is
beautiful I'm really wanting to use this
palette because I want to dig into some
warm tones and then I also pulled some
Catrice Aquafresh highlighting
eyeshadows which I showed in a previous
video this week so go check that out if
you haven't seen it already
and then this Palladio crushed metallic
eyeshadow that just looks phenomenal and
I feel like would look amazing with this
so for my day makeup it really just
depends on what I'm doing how much time
I have everything like that today I'm
going to show you the day look that I do
when I have enough time but if I don't
have a lot of time I'll usually just
prime put some powder on top and then
put a little bronzer in the crease and
then mascara and I'm gone so that way I
could come back and just build on top of
that later which just gives you a nice
clean canvas but for today I'm going to
show you what I do when I have a little
bit more time and if I think I want to
do more of a dramatic look later on I'm
gonna go in with the meet matrimony
palette first
I'm gonna take this shade right here and
I'm going to set my primer which is so
important because this primer is pretty
sticky right off the bat so you
definitely want to set it that way none
of your eyeshadows drag and you know get
caught up in the stickiness of it you
want it to be as smooth as possible and
what I'm also gonna do too is since this
is a daytime look I'm going to keep
everything mostly matte and then we'll
ample it up ampulla and then we'll amp
it up alright next up I'm going to take
a fluffy blending brush this one is the
more feet in for one one and I'm gonna
go in with this Matt Lopez right here
the dose of colors eye shadows are very
very pigmented so I like to go in with
something else to have as my transition
shade especially if I'm doing a daytime
look because sometimes I can get a
little carried away with how pigmented
they are and I just like want to put all
the colors on my eyes I just want to
have like this big blown out like orange
makeup all over my face now what I'm
gonna do is I'm actually gonna go in
with this shade right here this is the
ten buck brush so literally what it's
called and you can see how pigmented
these are I'm gonna go in and fluff this
into my crease kind of just doing
windshield wiper motions back and forth
I'm just lightly touching my eye these
colors are very very pigmented okay so
all I'm doing now is just kind of going
back in building up the color a tad bit
I really hope you can't hear that rain
okay and then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go in it with this color right
here and we're also gonna take that on
the same brush fluff this into the outer
V this will give it a more softer look
not so intense because we're going in
with such a fluffy brush but it will add
some definition to the eye so I'm just
gonna fluff it right in there so you can
see it add some depth but it's nothing
too intense at least for me okay and
then what I'm gonna do is go back in
with the second shade we used and just
touch up that crease make sure we didn't
lose that really pretty light peach
color now you can obviously stay away
from like peaches and warm toned shades
like this I really like them they're
just like some of my favorite colors to
work with so for me I feel
going out in the daytime with this but
if you're not you could always do this
all over the lid like we just did go in
with Matt Lopez again into the crease
you can also go in a little bit more
with Matt Rossi like we did with the
really light peachy color and then
deepen and up in the outer V with Matt
Reeves so you could keep it more neutral
not super warm but I'm just gonna go in
and blend this out and then what I'm
going to do is take another brush this
is a Mac 242 so will really pack the
color on to that lid I'm going in with
that very first shade that we used and
I'm going to put this right in the inner
corner and just brighten up this area oh
look at that these are so pigmented easy
to blend and I feel like these with the
dose of colors I shadows are just so
pretty being at that first brush we use
I'm gonna go lightly over the edges just
to soften it out right now my favorite
mascara is this essence of volume
stylist 18 our lash extension mascara
gives you so much volume it's only a few
dollars okay so I have some mascara on
my lid but what I'm gonna do is let that
dry while we move on to face and I'll
come back and fix it before we're done
so now we're going to do is move on to
face again you want to make sure you're
wearing long wearing products and things
are gonna last a very long time so you
just wanna make sure these products are
you're holding grilles you've tested
them and they work for you today I'm
going to be applying the one heck of a
blot primer from soap &amp;amp; Glory this is
going to fill in my pores keep me matte
and this will keep the makeup on all day
long I'm gonna go in and then today I
will be using the LA girl Pro matte HD
foundation I love this foundation I have
been mixing it with the Catrice prime
and fine makeup drops these are going to
darken up the foundation so I'm going to
make this concoction real quick and I
actually just left and so I'm pretty
dark right now so I'm just gonna apply
this and really it blend it out
I really make sure that my nose is
completely covered with foundation
before I even go in with concealer
that's just to make sure that none of
that redness peeks through by get
redness anywhere it's usually in my nose
or on my chin so I just really make sure
to press that product in there so it
last all day
next time I'm going to using the NARS
radiant creamy concealer this is a great
concealer as well it's nice and full
coverage and long wearing they actually
added six more shades which i think is
great this is a shade that I'll be using
it is in the color medium too this is a
great color for me when I'm nice and
self-tan because it does add great
coverage I like underneath the eye but
it's nothing too light so we are gonna
keeping it more daytime appropriate with
the color of this it's nothing too
intense nothing very highlighted now I'm
just gonna kind of going over my skin
making sure everything is pressed in
there's no excess product hanging out my
color guard is like more red toned but
my natural tan is like this color so
sorry I'm going in with this makeup
revolution luxury of baking powder it
says the natural heat from your body
will cook powder over base foundation or
concealer giving you a flawless finish I
just got this and I've been really
intrigued to try it I hate this
packaging but we're gonna test it out in
a vise kind of got a light yellow tint
to it so this is gonna add a little bit
of highlight to the under eyes so we are
gonna bake with this I just put some in
the lid and then we'll go in and set the
rest of the face with a brush but this
area is going to bake because this is
where I get oily and I want to make sure
that powder really sets in there and
keeps me matte for a long period of time
so we're gonna let that bake and then
what I'm gonna do now is actually move
on to eyebrows so for brows I'm here
much to the same brow no matter what
look I'm doing if I'm putting on makeup
I'm gonna do the same exact brow just
like to fill them in like normal so I'm
going to be using the Catrice climatic
ultra precise brow pencil I'm gonna use
these two shades right here I'm going to
use medium for the outer
and then light for the inner part
okay so brows are done I'm going to set
them with the wet-and-wild
ultimate brow mascara this is great just
a tinted brow gel kind of adds like
little highlights to your brows it's
probably personal preference more than
anything you could use a clear one but I
like the tinted brow gels because I feel
like it makes it look a little bit more
natural so I just apply it and then I
brush through with the spoolie it kind
of just lightens them up and gives them
little highlights okay and then I'm
gonna go in with a little bit more of
that powder and just set the outer part
of my face this way our bronzer doesn't
stick not Bowlin well I'm going to
bronze using this Catrice Sun glow matte
bronzing powder looks really pretty I
don't think I've used this before
oh that I'm just gonna blend that
bronzer with a duo fiber brush and it
seems like it's blending really really
well except I'm going to add a little
bit of blush I'm going to skip contour
for the daytime and just do bronzer but
for blush I'm going to be using this
Cokie cosmetics blush palette and
blushing and I do a mix of the lightest
right here in this darker peach just to
kind of go along with the eyes okay now
what we're gonna do is highlight using
these new highlighters from NARS Renee
just one palette cuz I only have one
face there are two different palettes so
the first one is Rev sell a and this one
is super pretty this is what the
packaging looks like by the way again
these are available at Nordstrom you can
buy them early if you go down below and
check out the link it has kind of like
the same packaging here on the front
here are the gorgeous shades you see I
had to dig into them so this is the one
that we're going to be using today but
then you also have a another palette
right here this one is coucher de soleil
so I kind of say that one a little bit
better these are a little bit deeper
they are so beautiful I'm gonna just
swatch these for you so you can see them
so there are the shades in this palette
very reflective very pretty but we are
gonna use this one right here on our
face
I'll be using the NARS heo brush so I'm
gonna go into this one first and we're
just going to apply this to the tops of
our cheekbone it just gives a really
gorgeous look at that glow it just gets
a really pretty glow and this brush just
really busts it in nicely so we just
kind of went with more of a subtle
highlight for right now I am going to go
ahead and just blend this out a bit just
so we have a nice glow because again
this is for daytime so we are just gonna
do a light glow for daytime but I'm
gonna dip my finger into here
and put this on my Cupid's bow so pretty
and then also down my nose that is so
pretty it's great for daytime because
it's nothing too intense it's not very
shimmery at all it's not going to
enhance a lot of your texture or
anything like that
which I have the biggest problem with
also gonna take that lighter shade right
there and use a smaller brush to put
this right underneath that brow bone to
highlight because I do love highlighting
my brow bones with like the same
highlighter that I use on my cheeks also
gonna put this in the inner corner this
will kind of wake us up make us look a
little bit more alive okay so let's
finish off the eyes I'm gonna take the
pencil brush and then the sassy siennas
palette and I'm just going to take this
shade right here and fluff this
underneath the outer part of that lower
lash line right here and one last tip I
want to give you guys for daytime
something that's going to make the
biggest difference if your eyelashes is
putting liner on your upper waterline
this is really gonna make your lashes
look a lot fuller fluffy and just really
pretty so I'm going to be using this
cargo cosmetics swimmable eyeliner it's
just a regular black pencil liner then
for lower lashes I am going to top off
with this skinny mascara from Wet wild
one of my favorite mascaras for my lower
lash line honestly nothing can hang with
this it gives just enough mascara on
that lower lash line now for lips I'm
going to go into a Soph on over you this
is a rocker
chick j-cap beauty Velvet Touch
waterproof gel lipliner that was a lot
so I want to be applying this to my lips
is the first time I've used it very
exciting test it out
seems very long wearing because it's
waterproof oh it's a retractable one
mm-hmm
went in that is it okay so let's see
not super creamy has a smell a strong
smell kind of feels crumbly like not
super smooth it's not dry skin that's
literally this lip liner I actually want
to try out this Maybelline Python
metallic lip kit so we're obviously
gonna go in with the more subtle color
first it just looks really cool and I
should try it so this is what it looks
like this is what you put all over your
lips first and then you go in with that
later so I'm gonna be using this one
first for the daytime look don't get
that you can't beauty a lip liner that's
pretty terrible
it's like clumping all over the place so
I'm just gonna apply this all over and
then I am gonna top it with this L'Oreal
infallible paints matte in Peach Pit
which is perfect for this look yeah it's
good okay so that is the daytime look
something warm peachy
this is definitely something I would
wear in the daytime I think it looks
really nice it's fun to have like a pop
of color if you're wearing something
very neutral I think it's really pretty
and peachy tones are so flattering I
feel like on every one so now what I'm
gonna do is share with you how to amp
this up which only takes a few steps I
know that was a little bit longer of a
makeup tutorial but again if you have to
be quick do something really easy for
the daytime you could throw bronzer in
the crease feel like I've done so many
daytime looks where I put bronzer in the
crease that I wanted to do something a
little bit different so I threw some
warm tones in there the warm tones not
so different but throwing it in there
for a daytime look pretty different what
we're gonna do is go in with this
Palladio crushed metallic eye shadow
this is gorgeous it's like a peachy
metallic color look at that these
metallic eye shadows from Claudia are
like incredible absolutely incredible
make sure you tap off that excess
because it will get all over your lashes
if
not careful and we're just going to
build this up in the inner corner also
apply this with your finger if you
wanted to like look at that color let me
just show you real quick wonderful and
out the edges of that so you can see it
just really amps up the look like I said
you can also take your finger and just
press it in to really get that intense
payoff and then if you want it to be
even more shimmery glowy and pretty you
can go in with something on top of that
so what I'm going to take today aqua
fresh eyeshadow this is the highlighting
eyeshadow from Jake after you know from
this is from Catrice it's just a really
nice light shade and you could take it
with your finger and just dot this on
top if you just want to Pat that on top
and it will really amplify what you have
going on just be careful with it because
it does not blend very well okay then
I'm going to add that
Palladio crushed eyeshadow right on top
and it kind of just gives it a more wet
look very pretty love this so I see it
doesn't take any time to really do that
but look at the difference and those two
and notice we're really just focusing on
eyes our face is done so if you wanted
to go from day to night this is gonna
pretty much take you know time to do
this once you get home and you H up
dinna getting ready to go out so again
it looks really pretty on its own but if
you want to amp it up you could put that
aqua fresh eyeshadow on top like look at
how intense that's dried down on my
finger these are intense I'm gonna line
my upper lash line with this Milani
matte eyeliner it's in matte black this
is going to define that eye and then
also give us ready for lashes because
this will make our lashes look really
nice and seamless okay so before I put
lashes on
I'm gonna kind of finish up the rest of
my face I am gonna go in with this
Catrice Prime and fine professional
contouring palette and I'm just going to
use the contour shade and put this under
my cheekbones to carve out the face I'm
using a little wet wild brush right here
and we're just gonna really define this
area and I'm also going to contour my
nose
this is optional but necessary for me
okay and since we just added some
bronzer to the nose I am gonna go back
in with a highlight palette and just
touch-up down that Center going to use
my finger and just really work this in
there and blend it out wow that is
pretty it's such a smooth highlighter
that it looks like your skin is
literally glowing it doesn't look like
you put on a ton of highlighter but your
nose is like blinding right now okay
next up what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna add that liner that we used
earlier that cargo cosmetics black liner
on my waterline but we have that liner
on I'm taking my dose of colors palette
and I'm going into the deepest shade
right here with this flat definer brush
and I'm gonna push this up against that
lower lash line
it's really gonna smoke it out I'm
taking it all the way in the inner
corner as well
so I'm using Matt Lopez or right here
and we want to blend out that lower
lashline looking at my face up close
after all the product we put on our eyes
I don't really have much fallout at all
which is amazing nice so now the lashes
I'm going to cut them and put some glue
on it let it get tacky and then I'll be
back after I've applied it to to the
finished highlight product in our list
and then we'll be done so I'll be right
back and this is what it looks like with
the lashes on I do need to go over it
with some liner but this is what it
looks like I think it looks really
pretty I'm enjoying it and then what I'm
gonna do now is just build up the
highlighter on my face does it look like
if I just use my finger so just adding a
little bit extra with my finger Wow like
right in the center and just applying
that Wow
that is so pretty and again I just took
this brush with all three shades and
kind of just took it up to my temple
above my brow and it just kind of adds
that glow all the way up and over okay
and then the last thing we're gonna do
is go into this Maybelline lip palette
and provoke to use this shade just see
what it looks like in the middle of my
lips I think it's cool it definitely
adds a metallic look to your lips so
pretty and it's like a matte it's really
interesting a little fun metallic shade
and this palette doesn't really go with
this look this whole lip color is kind
of like topi which is why I had to go in
with this L'Oreal lip paints but it is
really cool very pretty it's a nice
matte metallic so that is my day to
night makeup look you guys I really hope
you enjoyed it again it's just all about
how much time you have what you're
willing to do for your daytime makeup
then I feel like for me nighttime is
always pretty easy because I have
everything on and set in place and ready
to go it's really just about amplifying
what you've already put on adding a
little bit more highlight adding some
stuff to your crease
lashes lashes make the biggest
difference in the world thank you guys
so much for watching and I will see you
all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
