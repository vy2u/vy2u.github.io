all about high-end skin care products /
body products that did not work out for
me I have quite a bit of products to
share with you guys so I'm gonna try to
get through this video pretty quickly
but honestly high-end skin care is just
one of those things that is like a hit
or miss for me I have very sensitive
skin some of these products either just
broke me out didn't do anything for my
skin or just smell freaking terrible so
we're gonna talk about all the products
today that I have purchased / have been
sent that I don't like and I quickly
want to say just like everybody says
before any of these videos if you see a
product that you like in this video
don't be offended by it everybody has
different skin types and just
preferences when it comes to their
skincare especially so these videos
aren't intended to trash the brand or
say the brand is shitty it's just to say
that these products didn't work out for
me and if you have the same kind of skin
then you know just to watch out for them
and maybe just get a sample when you go
to these high-end counters or like
Sephora or something if you guys enjoyed
these videos don't forget to give it a
thumbs up so I know to continue to keep
doing them and yeah let's just go ahead
and get on to the disappointing products
okay so the first brand I want to talk
about I have two products from them just
because they both didn't work out well
for me at all if you've been watching me
for I would say a couple months now I
have been loving the Canon Austin a
private protect mattifying primer this
thing is amazing and I love it I don't
have any breakouts coz of it so since I
love that primer so much I was like
alright let's try some more products
from them it's an expensive brand okay
but I was like let's just try it out
because that primer is amazing so I
decided to get the Canon Austin
retexturize glycolic complex treatment
lotion and also the face and body
retexture scrub this has salicylic acid
in it 0.5% and then 10% glycolic acid I
think as I say I call it glycolic but
these broke me out so incredibly bad
like I had rashes on my skin and I hate
to say that because I I love this brand
and I don't want you to not like it but
I know salicylic acid breaks me out but
I didn't think this would really matter
the 0.5%
I have to scrub my back every
I do not scrub my back every day with a
product it will break out it's just I
don't know what it is sweating from the
gym product for my hair I don't know and
it's the most embarrassing thing I've
ever had to deal with I have to use this
product from first-day beauty I can't
remember what it's called off the top of
my head right now but I've been through
like five of them and I love it it keeps
my skin nice and clear but I figured I
would try this out to see if it would
help a little bit more maybe help with
the texture especially here on my chest
I have not seen my back breakout as bad
as it did when I use these two products
and I used the lotion on my chest and I
just broke out so bad my body skin I
feel like it's pretty sensitive
especially my back and my chest so these
did not work out for me I'm so sad to
say it because I love I love the primer
from this brand but these just did not
work out for me so I had to pass on the
moving on to the next body product this
is the origins warm down warming lava
scrub to detox and smooth so this is
what it looks like and this works it's
warm but let me tell you something the
first time I use this I put probably
like I would say between a quarter and a
dime sized amount on my hands and I was
gonna use it on my chest because I'm
trying to get this area like nice and
smooth so I exfoliated it a couple times
a week maybe like once a week I put this
on my chest and I was like holy crap
it's not like I gotta burn it was so hot
and I was like I freaking hate this
product look I thought I was gonna love
it like a nice little warm sensation No
so then what I just said do is I was
like okay alright I see I'm an idiot
it's really hot I got it I mean use a
little bit less and even like a
pea-sized amount was just too warm for
my skin I don't know if I'm just a big
baby because I'm pretty sure I read good
reviews on this product but it's just
way too warm for me not my cup of tea
and do not use a lot of this product
because it will freaking burn okay if
you have very very sensitive skin you're
sensitive to like heat stuff like this I
would say pass on it because it's gonna
freaking scare the crap shoot I love
origins I think it's a great brand but
this product just did not work out for
me I think it's just a little too
intense for my liking but if you do love
that warm sensation
really warm warm sensation I think you
would like this so hot let's move on to
some makeup wipes I have used quite a
lot of these there are 50 towelettes
that come in this if the Clinique pet
start quick cleansing swipes so I got
this in a PR kit with a bunch of their
new prep start line thing going on these
were not my favorite wipes even though
I've almost used all of them I use them
to clean off swatches and to just like
touch up underneath my eyes definitely
prefer the Neutrogena makeup remover
cleansing towelettes I feel like they're
just not as harsh these over these okay
so next up it's a moisturizer and I just
cannot seem to give this brand a break
everything I've tried from them just
hasn't been one of my favorite items
it's not a crappy product but I just
don't see how it's worth the price tag
for me it hasn't worked wonders on my
skin at all I will continue to use this
product but like I said I don't see a
huge difference and I would never
repurchase it so it's the touch-up
balanced pore perfecting water gel
moisturizer I know it's how do people
love this brand and that they have great
things for like dry skin but I do have
larger pores I don't mind if look you
know I do have larger pores in this area
I've been using this and I don't notice
a huge difference whatsoever it's just
not my favorite it doesn't make my pores
look a little bit smaller it doesn't mat
if I I would much rather use this
diwanji moisturizer this is a matte one
from them and I really like it has a
strong scent but it goes away once you
put your makeup on but I much rather use
this than this one I mean the packaging
is gorgeous and it feels really cooling
on the skins it's probably the reason
why I don't get PR from them because
every time I purchase something and try
it out I just don't think it's worth it
so I'm sorry but I have to pass on this
one
okay onto a product that I just do not
like the scent of and like I can't stand
the scent so much that I will not use
this product ever again so this is the
SA edit pink peony overnight water pack
just put it on before you go to bed it
is very hydrating I thought since it had
the word peony in it I would be obsessed
because we all know I love florals
they're my favorite but this just oh
something about it it is like isn't it
it makes me nauseous
my face and I was like what the hell and
I ended up going to bed with it because
I was like I'm not gonna take this off
and put another one on but I was
miserable honestly because you could
smell it for a long period of time I
just do not like this product but it did
moisturize really well so if you do like
this then I think you would like this
but I cannot get past that and girl I
just can't do it alright so let's talk
about the thing that I'm really pissed
off about and I just do not like this is
the Bliss fuzz off precision hair
removal cream and this is for your
bikini area now I have tried Nair and
all that other kind of stuff and it just
does not work
I love the bliss oh do I have min here I
don't have them if you guys watched my I
think was July hits and misses video I
mentioned the Bliss like ingrown
eliminating pads and I love them I also
love the Bliss facial hair remover it's
amazing for like your stash so I thought
hey for the bikini area this is gonna be
freaking awesome right mm-hmm
this burned so bad honestly I was
looking so forward to this product that
I was like really upset that I didn't
work and super disappointed so this is
not work if you have coarse hair it's
not gonna get that hair out it's just
not gonna happen
stick to waxing that's what I do I
wanted to try it out and see if it
worked and it doesn't it's kind of like
one of those things that just didn't
work and it smells absolutely terrible
is the worst smell ever and it lingers
and it's just disgusting
okay this product I love for my legs but
I got it for my underarms area because
I'm super sensitive there and I get like
red bumps easily if I'm not careful I
bought this because I was thinking that
it would help with that this is the pro
pro so I don't know this is what the
packaging looks like I got this off so
far it's basically a sensitive skin
shaving cream and again I wanted to get
this for my underarms but when I use
this on my underarms I noticed I get a
lot more irritation than I do if I just
use skintimate so I had to quit using
this underneath my arms I love it for my
legs though it gives a nice smooth silky
finish to your legs like once you shave
your legs with this and then get out of
the shower it just feels so soft kind of
like a moisturizer but for my underarms
didn't work so if you're like me I'm
looking for something for your underarms
and thinking that this will help with
any irritation it just didn't work I
don't know if it's because of that
little film that it does leave that
makes everything super soft but it
definitely just irritated my underarm
area and yeah I would have to say pass
on this if you want it for your
underarms but if you want for your legs
and to be super smooth and soft I would
definitely get it because I'm still
gonna use it for my leg and it smells
like fresh-cut floral it's it smells
amazing
but again irritation can't do it this
one I wanted to love so bad but it just
broke me out it's the connelly
moisturizing my design fluid and it's
basically a mattifying moisturizer this
is what it looks like I did it so long
ago I've tried it quite a few times but
every single time I would get just like
little breakouts like little whiteheads
on my face
and I just couldn't deal with it it
looks really bad on my skin maybe my
texture really terrible so I'm so sad I
cannot use this I'm definitely gonna
give it to a friend though because this
is still pretty much full I break out
really easily so I'm so sad about that
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and enjoy seeing the disappointing
products that I have dealt with for the
past couple of months

anything like that it's just to inform

just didn't work out so I hope you
