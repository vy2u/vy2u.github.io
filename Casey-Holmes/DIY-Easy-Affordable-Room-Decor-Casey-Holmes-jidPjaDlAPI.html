out like every night we can do what we
want to we're all with the windows down
meet up with the boys and we go
hey guys so today's video is going to be
a fun DIY and it's just for room decor I
love watching these kinds of videos I
love going on Pinterest finding
different ideas as well and I decided to
come up with a few different things to
show you all that are really easy to do
and also are not that bad in price the
most expensive thing I think I bought
was my shadow box for $30 but I bought
it at Hobby Lobby so you could probably
go to Walmart or Target and get it for
much cheaper but everything else is
pretty much affordable and you can
always switch things up to the colors of
your room I hope you guys enjoy this
video if you end up trying any of these
out then please hashtag me at KC HL 91
because I would love to see it and see
what you came up with and if you do like
DIY videos then give this one a thumbs
up and leave a comment down below
letting me know what kind of DIY you
want to see next cuvee for school could
be another room decor maybe like
organization or something like that just
let me know what you have in mind
and especially for back-to-school videos
August is right around the corner so
summer is almost over ah its little eyes
so let me know what you guys would see
you in the comments below and thank you
guys again so much for watching and
let's go ahead and jump on into the
video so for this first project you're
going to need a shadow box and you're
also going to need some fake flowers so
first off take the back of the shadow
box out and then you're going to want to
take your fake flowers and just pop off
the tops so basically all you're needing
is the flower part and you can just get
rid of the fake stem and I got my
flowers and shadow box from Hobby Lobby
but you can of course get these from
Walmart Target those would be cheaper
alternatives and I recommend them over
Hobby Lobby because this one was a
little bit pricey but I love the flowers
and the shadow box so I figured why not
so just keep popping off all the flowers
until you have all of them arranged in
your shadow box and keep in mind you
don't want a lot of space in the shadow
box you want it base
we filled with flowers and petals so
just stuff this box until it's
completely full and it should look a
little something like this once you're
completely done and then we're going to
take the back of the shadow box and
press this down and secure it into place
and then after you secure it into place
this is what it should look like it's
super pretty and a fun way to add a pop
of color to any space that you're
wanting to amp up a little bit
so our next project is going to be a DIY
chalkboard picture frame and you're
going to need any picture frame you
prefer some chalkboard paper which I got
out of the scrapbook section and also
some chalkboard markers so I'm just
going to pop the back of this frame out
and I'm also going to take the glass out
of the frame as well because I just want
the chalkboard part to be front and
center no shininess nothing and then I'm
going to take the chalkboard paper and
just place this right on top of the back
of the frame and this is going to be our
guide to see how much chalkboard paper
we should cut off and I did get this
picture frame for half off so I didn't
pay $30 for it I got it for 15 which I
thought was a steal since it is super
super cute
so after you've got everything pretty
much measured out you just want to pop
that right into the frame and then also
put the backing on it and then this is
what it should look like and then the
next step is just to find your favorite
quote or you could put down your
schedule anything like that I decided to
go to my Pinterest and find one of my
favorite things I've pinned so this was
the one I decided to use I just love
this little quote I think it's really
inspiring so I'm going to go ahead and
use these markers which were a little
bit expensive but feel free to use
regular chalk if you want I just wanted
a more clean look and I'm just going to
copy that quote on this picture frame
and kind of switch up the colors a
little bit don't mind my handwriting
I've never been super super girly but I
tried my best for you
so after you're done decorating it
however you prefer this is what it
should look like and I think it's just a
fun way to kind of get inspired each day
and it's just super cute as well who
doesn't want to look at it right so the
next one is going to be a DIY tray for
your room I'm taking this wooden tray
from Hobby Lobby which is like six bucks
some black spray-paint ribbon glue and
also a piece of scrapbook paper I did
show a clear topcoat thing but I ended
up not using that so don't worry about
that stuff and I'm going to go ahead and
spray paint this whole wooden thing
black really really simple and I didn't
have a newspaper so that's why I have a
ton of garbage bags down after you've
got that done you just want to make sure
it dries completely give it a few hours
and then this is what it should look
like and then I'm taking this scrapbook
paper which matches my comforter in my
room so I wanted it to kind of go along
with that theme and I'm just going to
put this tray down and trace along the
scrap of paper and then of course cut it
out
and this is going to be the bottom of
our tray so all you're going to do is
press that scrapbook paper in make sure
you press it nice and tightly and then
also run your fingers along the corners
and make sure it all gets deep in there
so you don't have like any gaps or
anything like that so just take your
fingernail or whatever and run it along
the edges so then when you take your
knife to go and clean out the edges it's
going to be nice and precise and there
won't be any gaps or anything like that
the great thing about this tray is you
can customize it to however your room is
whatever colors you're using whatever
your favorite color is you can customize
it to this tray and use whatever you
want feel free to get crazy with it and
then I'm going to take ribbon glue and
just put this around the outer edges of
the tray this is just what I had and it
ended up working really well and then
you just want to press your scrap paper
down and you are good to go you have
your DIY tray and you can put your
perfumes your favorite lotions your
jewelry whatever you want it's right
there for you and I love this for the
top of my stands next up I'm going to be
taking two letters which are my initials
some spray paint glitter blast and also
some Mod Podge and the first thing we're
going to do is just spray paint the
letter C and also the letter H with this
gorgeous teal spray paint obsessed with
this color so you just want to spray
that you don't touch these until they
are nice and dry
and then for the letter C I'm going to
go ahead and take some paint tape I'm
not sure they call this but it's the
blue tape that they use for painting or
whatever I'm just going to do diagonal
lines and this is the one that I'm going
to use the glitter spray paint on so you
just want to kind of make sure the
spaces are as even as possible doesn't
have to be perfect because honestly
people won't know unless it's like super
crazy dramatic but this is what it
should end up looking like after you've
got it all taped down and this is when
the C was dry so keep that in mind as
well
after you got all taped down just take
your glitter spray and go crazy with it
I think this blue and gold is so
gorgeous and I absolutely loved the way
it turned out
so again just spray-paint it until it's
completely covered and just let it dry
overnight and you want to leave the tape
on it to when you're letting it dry
for this next DIY I'm just going to take
some of my favorite pictures with
different memories from the summer so
far and I'm also going on tumblr and
getting some summer pics and I'm going
to cut out some of these and I'm going
to arrange them on my letter H because
we're going to do like a little memory
collage so first thing I'm going to do
is take this Mod Podge I did get the
glossy one because I wanted it to be
shiny so this is what it looks like
and fun fact I'm really good at like
juggling things like this I don't know
what they call it flipping I don't know
I catch it everytime I rarely ever drop
something and I'm going to take the Mod
Podge like I was saying and just put a
light layer all over the letter H I did
start with my right side first and then
when I went to the left side I did apply
another layer there I do recommend
taking your pictures and putting some of
the Mod Podge on the back and sticking
it on the wood as well just so it's
easier to kind of maneuver and you can
also turn and switch up the pictures as
well and by the way thank you to the
subscriber who made that cute pic of me
and Lilly obviously I'm in love with it
because I had to include it in this
collage so you're just going to take
your pictures and lay them out however
you want to
and then you want to let this dry for
about 15 minutes and after it's
completely dry go ahead and take Mod
Podge one more time
with a little foam brush and just
lightly put another coat over it just so
everything seals in place and it's nice
and glossy when it's ready you are done
with both of those little DIYs and I
hope you guys enjoyed this I thought it
was super fun to make these I really
like these over my bed I've been looking
for different decorations for my room
