Thursday I figured I would do a d.i.y
Pizza highlight because we all know I
love pizza just like almost the rest of
the world and I haven't seen this
everywhere I'm kind of like late on
trying this I've even seen like a cookie
bronzer and I'm like I want to try that
that just seems like so fun so I'm going
to show you guys the process of me
making mine and we're gonna see at the
very end because I'm about to try it on
we're gonna see at the very end how well
it looks and just see how I did
basically for this video I just wanna
see if it was as easy as everybody says
it is and like to make and I want to see
if it made up really pretty highlight so
if you want to see how I made my pizza
highlighter then let's just go ahead and
get started okay so the first thing
you're going to need is just a compact I
used an old Milani blush and then I've
got this 15 piece travel kit from CVS I
had some jars in it so that's exactly
what I needed I got some alcohol and
then you're also going to need something
to mix with this is just like a cuticle
push back thing and this was amazing and
then you're just going to use makeup
that you haven't used in a long time you
don't like use whatever you want to use
so I'm going to take my first jar and
I'm going to make the crust in this one
so I'm going to take this elf matte
palette which I actually really do love
I just never use it so this had kind of
like the perfect colors for this so I
decided to use it and it's affordable so
I got ways buy another one I'm going to
use this color right here and I'm going
to put the whole thing into this first
jar then I'm going to take a little bit
of this Tila eyeshadow and kitten and
put this in there as well and this is
also going to add a little bit of
highlight to the darker shade which is
going to be the crust then you just want
to mix it up all together and try not to
have a lot of big chunks I mean I did
I'm not perfect but just try not to
going back in that palette I'm taking
this lighter shade and then going up a
couple shades and taking the more tan
mid-tone color and mixing these together
and then I'm putting the rest of the
Stila eyeshadow and kit in in with this
as well and just mixing it up what's so
fun about this is you get to mix
different things and see how other
colors work together I honestly had so
much fun using this I wanted to go in
with a little bit more of a highlight
shade and this is the mary lou manizer I
never use this I mean I have to so
there's like one I never use so I
decided to pop
when in that jar is well and then for
the pepperoni I'm going to take a little
bit of this Stila eyeshadow and I'm
going to put this into the jar and I'm
not using a lot of this since we don't
need a lot of product for the pepperoni
but then I'm also going in with the mary
lou manizer again and putting a little
bit of this into that shade and then of
course like the other ones mixing it all
up so the first go around I definitely
learned that I put a little too much
alcohol in the red shade you definitely
want to start out with a little bit and
work your way up you don't want it to be
a watery consistency you want it to be
more of a mousse consistency so I put a
little too much in the red one but I
learned my lesson and took my time with
the other two so you can see the texture
of this one is kind of what you want
some people would probably say to not
have as chunky of eyeshadow like I have
but honestly it worked girl it worked
for me I didn't want to take like thirty
hundred hours trying to mix all this
together
but then I went in with the darker crust
and you can see it's kind of turning a
grey brown and it seemed like it just
got lighter as I used it but it's still
really pretty you can see that was kind
of a moosie texture as well then I'm
going to take that cuticle thing that I
bought I'm going to push the brown or
the gray now on the outer perimeters of
the pan you basically are creating the
pizza now so you want to have the darker
color on the outer part and then of
course put the lighter color in the
middle and for this one the consistency
was perfect enough for me to be able to
use my finger to push it in I was kind
of being a perfectionist about this part
like I took a lot of time to press this
product in and to move it in with the
crust so I don't know you don't have to
take that much time I took a lot of time
but that's just because I was having fun
like messing with makeup so after you do
that then you can move on to the
pepperoni and even though mine was a
little bit watery it was still easy to
work with since I had this tool so I'm
just going to take the tool and dot on
pepperoni you can do a little bit of
pepperoni you can do a lot if you do a
lot you're definitely going to have more
color um I would start off with a little
bit don't put too much product on the
pan because if you want it to be a pure
highlight you don't want too much of
that pepperoni so this is what mine look
like after I was done and then I'm going
to
take that same tool I've been using and
I'm going to cut up the pizza after that
you're ready to go ahead and try out
your highlighter you do want to let it
sit in the refrigerator for a few hours
I let mine sit for about three but yeah
I just let it sit in there cool and
Harden and then you'll be good to go and
you'll be able to use it
okay guys so this is my Pizza
highlighter right looks so funny it
looks so funny on camera so this is my
Pizza highlighter it's right near my
face and I smell the alcohol oh my
goodness
as you can see my crust turned gray I
think I put too much highlight in it but
we don't Pizza discriminate here so
every pizza is beautiful in their own
way I'm gonna go ahead and dip my brush
in here I'm hoping that this turns out
okay because I don't want to take my
makeup off I have some things to do
we'll see I think I put too many
pepperonis in here so I'm taking my
little Anastacio brush it's looking
pretty dark like the red from the
pepperoni first let's like swatch it oh
yeah this is definitely more of a blushy
highlight because I'm getting a lot of
the pepperoni in there
oh god I'm nervous now should it unless
pepperoni I love pepperoni but it's
working I'm trying to like dig in the
areas where there's mostly highlight
like mostly just the pan of it oh it's
kind of pretty I see that oh I like it
actually I'm actually kind of digging
this oh my gosh I keep putting more and
more on and I can't help it look at how
pretty that is so even though this
scared me my swatched it actually looks
really pretty on the skin I mean it's
mixed with a lot of gorgeous
highlighters that's basically what it is
it's just gorgeous highlighters mixed
together and put on the face just put in
a pizza form but I really like it
so this is definitely a successful DIY
if you're willing to dig into your
makeup that you don't use and reuse them
and make something like this I
definitely think you should it was so
much fun
and I mean honestly who can say that
they have a pizza highlighter if you end
up making a pizza highlighter please
send it to me on Twitter anything tag me
on Instagram I would love to see all
your Pizza highlighters and Alfred tweet

are just so fun and pizza lovers are
just gonna be obsessed with this I
really hope you guys try this out also

do more like these DIY tested out videos
