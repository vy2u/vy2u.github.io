with you some of my top drugstore
favorites at the moment there has been a
ton of stuff that came out at the
drugstore within the past year I mean
this year the drugstore is just
exploding and I am loving it so thank
you drugstore but I will say some of the
prices of certain things have gotten
pretty high so if you could tone that
down just a tad that'd be great I have
tried so many different products and I
wanted to share my favorites with you
guys because I have a ton of different
favorites from my last one cut the last
one I did was like last the end of last
year I believe and I feel like I have a
whole new set of favorites so I'm really
excited to share it with you guys I hope
you enjoyed this video if you do like
these kinds of videos don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and leave a comment
down below letting me know what your
favorite drugstore product is because
I'm always trying to find new gems in
the drugstore okay so the first brand
we're going to talk about is wet and
wild Wet n Wild has been killing it
lately I just I have been really loving
wet wild
so the first thing I want to talk about
is this wet and wild highlighting and
concealing pin
I wanna Calise I did film this look this
is a look that took me only about 13 and
a half minutes to do so if you want to
check this out I will leave it down
below but I have this concealer on now
and I love it this is actually my second
one I think it's so good this is the
shade posing nude I believe but I
absolutely love it I feel like it covers
so well and it really does brighten your
under eyes and the center of your face I
just love it I do love the applicator I
feel like this is great for traveling
and it doesn't look cakey underneath
your eyes you definitely want to set it
because if you don't set it it will
settle into your fine lines and if it
does settle in just tap the concealer a
little bit get that excess product off
and you'll be good to go okay the next
product from wet wild is this mega glow
contouring palette this one is the
caramel toffee one and this is the one
with the banana powder in the super dark
contour gives this banana shade a lot
more than this one because it's just a
little too dark for my skin but if I
only have this palette I will contour
with it I'll just use a really light
hand and it blends out very well these
two powders are so smooth and creamy and
they
just look beautiful on the skin this is
great to set this concealer with so this
is the wet wild color icon blush all of
their blushes are amazing and this one
is just so good this is a new shade that
came out with I believe it's called
rosacea champagne and this is what looks
like this is like the perfect everyday
color this looks great with every single
look and there is a bit of shimmer in it
but you cannot tell on your skin to me
it just gives you a little hit of a glow
but it's nothing too overpowering so I
absolutely love this blush I mean I go
for colors like this this is my favorite
kind of colors a newest thing that has
came out from Wet n Wild is the Wet n
Wild mega glow highlighting powder I
only got one shade because I knew I
wouldn't use the other one much but this
was in the shade precious petals and it
broke mine so of course but this is what
it looks like it is the most beautiful
highlighter they have ever came out with
I absolutely adore this highlighter I'm
so happy this was the last one at my
Walgreens and I'm just obsessed with it
so you can see right there it just has a
nice glow to it it's really smooth and
blends out very well I don't know if you
can see it but I have it on right now
and it's such a nice glow and only a
couple dollars like you cannot meet that
moving on to L'Oreal I love these I have
a couple shades of them this is the
L'Oreal infallible Pro contour palettes
and I just use it strictly for the
contour shades you can use the highlight
if you want to but I don't really dig
into them much but these contour shades
are great they blend so well and they're
like the perfect contour color and it
just looks great underneath the
cheekbones it's not too warm I just
really love this again the highlighter
is not one of my favorites but hey you
can use it in the palette I mean it's
not terrible it's just not super super
illuminating and then I have to shout
out the L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion
I had this on right now I probably
should put a little powder on cuz I'm a
little glowy but this product does give
your skin a glow for me it's not
something I can use with really really
hot weather this was more of a colder
months foundation for me because I have
very oily skin so I usually go for
mattifying products in these hi
hmm you look so pretty
hmm Jesus me like I was saying this does
give your skin a glow to it so if you
have more normal to dry skin you would
probably love this during the spring and
summer but I have really oily skin so I
cannot wear it I got some more
mattifying products in the spring and
summer just so it lasts a lot longer on
my skin but I do love this if I'm not
going to be outdoors a lot I'm filming I
will wear this because I feel like it
just makes my skin glow right now like I
said I need a little bit of powder cuz
I'm looking a little shiny but I really
do love this product and honestly I feel
like this is the only drugstore
foundation I've been loving like this
one I would have to say if you're going
to spend your money because I know these
are expensive I would definitely check
this one out
next up is the L'Oreal glam bronze I
know you guys have seen this a lot on my
channel lately just because I can't get
enough of it I got the shade medium I
believe they have three shades this is a
huge bronzer this is such a great warm
bronzer so it's great to put all over
your face just to warm up your skin if
your face is a little bit lighter than
your body you can use this to you know
color up your face and make it match
neck a little bit more but I love this
because it does blend so well and it's
very buildable if you see this in your
Walgreens definitely check it out I
believe this is pretty pricey though
like $14.99 but by far my favorite I
think this is awesome ok and then the
last two things from L'Oreal are the
L'Oreal infallible Pro matte glosses I
feel like these are the best lip
products in the drugstore honestly I
think they have the best formula they
wear so well and they are a matte gloss
they're not a liquid lipstick so it's
not something that's going to be super
long wearing but they do last a really
long time I personally love them and my
two favorite shades are 3:18 bear
attraction and 316 statement nude oh
I'll do it up-close swatches of these
but I really love the applicator I love
the way it feels on the lips it doesn't
have like a really intense smell to it I
just think these are perfect so
definitely check them out they have a
ton of different shades I also try the
Maybelline like matte liquid lipsticks
or something like that I forget what
they called them but I hated the smell
of those oh god I'm crazy
incident to smells and those lip
products were just way too much for me I
couldn't handle it and then the last
product is this L'Oreal miss mango rock
mascara I'm wearing this right now I
really love this mascara and I also love
the original miss manga mascara they are
so good they give you your lashes so
much volume and they're so black this is
just one of my favorite lines and when I
saw they came out with the rock one I
was like oh yeah I have to try this out
and I love it just as much as the
original one like I can't pick between
that one or this one which one I love
more because I feel like they both give
me such great volume and it just looks
great on my lashes so I have one thing
it from Maybelline this is the
Maybelline master conceal camouflage and
concealer I have the shade 30 light
medium I need to go for a darker shade
for the summer now this is like great
coverage this has such high coverage and
I'm obsessed with it I love the fact
that it is a squeezy tube that is
awesome and it blends so well it can
blend easily with a brush or a Beauty
Blender it took me forever to get on
this bandwagon but once I did I honestly
like I can't use anything other than
this one and they went wild one those
are my two favorite concealers I haven't
tried the Maybelline fit me one yet I
really want to get my hands on it but so
far this one and the wet wild one are my
faves if I want more of a lighter
coverage I'll go for the wet wild if I
am doing a full glam makeup look I will
go for the Maybelline one okay so I do
want to talk about elf elf has great
eyeshadow palettes and this is one of my
favorites I think I bought this online
but this is the elf made format palette
and it's just an all matte palette and
it is absolutely beautiful you can do so
many different looks with this you can
do a nice dramatic look if you do a
light look or you can do anything in
between it's perfect these have great
pigmentation this is such a compact
sleek palette I think they did great
with the packaging of this it's
beautiful so definitely check out these
eyeshadows they are some of my favorites
and then another thing from elf is this
blush palette I have a couple of these
and also have the contour palette and
they're just great so this is the dark
palette and I like love this shade right
here of course I love it
they're super pigmented so you have to
be really light handed with these they I
mean the pigmentation is just insane
another cool thing is you could get all
these pallets and
you could pop out the colors like so I'm
like scared to do this in the air so you
can also pop out the colors and change
them out you can make your own little
palette put some contour shades in the
palette and a couple blushes and you'd
be set I love this I love the concept
they did such a great job with packaging
and all of the colors are honestly
gorgeous and I love the fact that it has
this huge mirror and this sleek
packaging I mean so good I also want to
mention NYX some people say NYX isn't a
drugstore brand but it is sold at Ulta
and it is affordable so I consider it
drugstore and the first thing is the NYX
skinny mascara I think this is great
for your bottom lashes this is kind of
like the Clinique bottom lash mascara
even though the Clinique one isn't super
expensive this is a little bit more
affordable and you can find this at
Target Ulta I think they're even now
going into Walgreens so I mean they're
not their drugstore I really like this
for my lower lashes because it doesn't
clump the lashes it separates them
really nicely and just gives them a
fluttery look what I'm doing looks like
this I don't really put mascara on my
bottom lashes just because I don't feel
like I need it but if I have liner and
everything on I will put my scare out my
bottom lashes and this one is great it
doesn't get all underneath my lower
lashes or anything and it doesn't flake
off next up is this NYX dark circle
concealer this is so good this is just a
really nice peachy tone concealer it
blends out so well it's not too creamy
and thick so if you have really oily
skin you can handle this just putting it
right underneath here if something's a
little too thick and creamy it will make
my oily skin just go crazy and I'll just
look disgusting my Sam will look gross
and caked OH so I love the formula of
this and I love the way it wears and it
covers up dark circles so well and your
concealer does not look caked up when
you put it on top of this because I just
use this to counteract some darkness put
my concealer on top I mean this would be
a great combo with the wet and wild
concealer since it is a lighter coverage
you could cover up your dark circles
with this put that on top and you would
be set so this is the NYX wonder pencil
you can use this for so many different
things you could use it to line your
lips after you've done your lip color
put it on your waterline use as
concealer you can just do so many
different things with this I have the
shade light and I love putting this on
my waterline for when I want my eyes to
look a little bit bigger and
wake it's just my go-to product and I
love it it's really creamy and it lasts
for such a long time and it's that
perfect shade where it's not too white
where it looks like BAM in your face
moving on to Ulta I want to shout this
Ulta press setting powder this is such a
good powder I love to use this for
underneath my eyes again this is in the
shade banana this is again a really
smooth powder like when I was at Ulta I
felt this and I was like whoa
I think this gets overlooked a lot and I
want to see if they have a translucent
one because I love this formula so much
it is a little bit smoother than the
next ones and it just looks so great on
the skin so definitely go check out
ulties setting powder last thing from
Ulta is the ultimate and deep I need a
lighter shade I have the deep one on
right now and since I went lighter with
my hair it's kind of like BAM in your
face but this is so good this is like
the benefit gimme brow it just fills in
your brows very very quickly and makes
you look like you have nice full brows I
love this if you're in a rush if you
just don't feel like messing with your
brows because I know I'm like that too
sometimes I'm just like I don't feel
like myself with them this is the
perfect way to go basically has the same
wand as the Gimme brow just really nice
and tiny and it is more affordable I
absolutely adore the makeup revolution
contour palette this is such a great
palette the colors blend so well and
they are just the perfect shade and I
love that these are affordable because
you get so many different products and
also the blush palette the one I have is
in hot spice it has a great variety of
colors again they blend really well very
very pigmented and I feel like they look
great on the skin sometimes I mix
different shades I'll use one shade I
mean you could get a bunch of different
colors out of this palette and it is
affordable so they also have a
highlighter that's really good this
one's actually in the shade radiant
lights and this is so it's just so
intense but it's beautiful like that is
such a stunning highlighter I think this
is only like 6 bucks this makeup
revolution brand I don't know when they
came into Ulta but I'm obsessed with
them and I'm always going to them when
I'm at Ulta because I just know they
have great product I'm just going to
quickly shout out some brushes this is a
blending brush from the brand la bee lab
I believe I got this at Walmart or CVS
it's just a nice blending brush it's
great to just put color into your crease
or blend something out it is a little
bit scratchy it's not super scratchy but
there is a little bit in there so just
have a really light hand with it and it
will blend out really well obviously
Real Techniques is one of my favorites
as well I love the purple set and I also
love the orange set these are the
brushes I use the most so the contour
brush buffing brush she deluxe crease
brush and also the shadow brush I love
these so much and then the best sibling
brush at the drugstore this is the brand
mua makeup academy professional I got
this at CVS and this is by far the best
drugstore stippling brush I have found
this is so similar to my Sigma and
Sedona lace one that honestly I don't
even I can't even tell the difference
when I reach for them so get this I
think this is a little bit pricey for a
drugstore brush I think it's like 10 to
13 dollars or something but it is so
good it has such a nice long handle the
bristles are nice and soft this is so
good this is like one of my favorite
finds honestly I love it and the elf
blending brush this is a really great
brush as well for concealer or a really
heavy coverage foundation it has nice
bristles they're really really soft and
it just blends out everything really
well so Elle has really great brushes in
general their kabuki brush is also
really amazing so I highly recommend
going and checking them out this is the
last brush this is from the drew
Barrymore line the flower line and
Walmart this is such a nice powder brush
it is so incredibly soft and it's not
too dense so it's great to just apply
like loose powder or any kind of powder
to your face oh my god it just looks so
soft you guys okay guys so that is it
for my drugstore favorites I really hope
you enjoyed this video if you did don't
