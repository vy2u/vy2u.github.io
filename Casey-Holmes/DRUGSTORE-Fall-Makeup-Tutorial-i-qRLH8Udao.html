be another fault makeup tutorial now I
know I'm a little ahead of myself with
these fault makeup tutorials I'm just so
excited for Paul and ready for it to be
here so let's just soak it in and enjoy
it because yeah it's gonna be fall
before you know it so I did this with
today this one is a drugstore look that
they did the only thing that is not
drugstore is my foundation because I was
having a really hard time with my
L'Oreal true match foundation covering
my redness so I just used my tx1 that
I've been talking about recently so that
is the only thing that it's not
drugstore but everything else is and I
did finally bust out the Maybelline the
nudes palette and I really like this
palette I've seen some kind of mixed
reviews on it but this is my first time
using it and so far I really liked it
this lip is actually like a really great
dupe for Mac's rebel so I'm excited for
you guys to see it I know my voice is a
little weird because I'm still sick from
this cold I've been having it just went
from being super congested to like a
sore throat to now I don't know what it
is I just can't quit coughing so
hopefully it'll be gone soon right yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you want more drugstore makeup looks and
then just give this one a thumbs up and
yeah let's just go ahead and get on to
the video okay so taking the Maybelline
the nudes palette I'm gonna go ahead and
take this shade right here and apply
this into the crease as my transition
shade so I'm just gonna blend this all
over this is one of those shades that
you are gonna have to build up because
it's not super pigmented but I like that
because you're not gonna put on too much
product at once so don't be afraid to
build this color up because it's
definitely needed
next we're gonna take the shade right
here and I love the burnt shade it's
like a burnt gold color it's so pretty
and it is very pigmented as you can see
going on my eye I was so surprised at
how easy this went on and how much color
payoff there was so I'm just gonna apply
this all over the lid and a little bit
into the crease as well
the shade right here I'm going to be
using this to blend out that gold shade
so I'm gonna apply this directly into
the crease and this is again another
shade you just have to kind of build up
it is pretty pigmented but you need to
keep building up to really blend this
stuff out but if these colors aren't
blending out how you want just don't get
frustrated just take your time with it
next time I take in this light gold
shade and I'm gonna place this directly
in the center of the lid this is just
gonna add a pop of highlight to the lid
and kind of add a little bit of extra
oomph to it so I just put this right in
the center and then took a clean a
blending brush and blend it out any of
the harsh lines that I had and it just
kind of adds a little
something-something to the look now it's
time to take off the tape and apply
liner I'm using the Maybelline eye
studio liner and black that you guys
know I've been loving this and I'm gonna
do just a regular line I'm not going to
wing it out or anything
I wasn't really feeling doing a winged
liner today so just go ahead and line
your upper lash line or you could skip
this step if you want to and then we on
line my upper waterline with Revlon
Colorstay in black and put on these
lashes from kiss so again this is the
only thing that's not drugstore in the
video which is the ex1 foundation
I really love it I've talked about so
much in my videos so if you want to see
me talk about a little bit more
I'll leave my favorites video in the
description box
taken is Jane Cosmetics concealer I'm
going to be placing this underneath my
eyes this is actually the lightest shade
that they have and as you can see it's
really not that light my skin tone is
pretty tan right now and this is not
that light so just full morning you the
concealers not that light
down taking the Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer in light and this one
is too light to put underneath my eyes
but it works in the center of my face so
that's what I'm highlighting with there
taking this wet and wild Fergie powder
this is in translucent I'm just going to
be setting the concealer that I put on
my face then for bronzer I'm taking NYC
bronzer and sunny it's been forever
since I've used this and I ended up
really loving this bronzer so I'm
probably gonna go back to it but I'm
just gonna put this on my forehead
cheeks and also right underneath my chin
next up it's time to contour I'm taking
this NYX blush in taupe and this was
actually the first time I used it and
I'm really really diggin it I love it it
just cast a nice shadow under your
cheekbone and it just looks so good I
really love it so if you've been
interested in trying this as a contour
shade definitely give it a go because it
looks awesome then I'm taking this
Jordana blush and touch of pink I want
to just to flush a pink on my cheeks I
didn't want to leave it there so this
color was perfect and these Jordana
blushes are beautiful so if you can find
them they're actually on cherry culture
calm I believe are super super beautiful
now I'm taking this ELF highlighter it's
not the best but it's what I had so I
just highlighted with that and then I'm
using this L'Oreal brow duo and again
these are really nice pencils the
lightest shade is just a little too warm
for me
but they were still really great pencils
really creamy and super easy to blend
out so if you want to check them out I
definitely recommend them because I
really was impressed by them going in
with the gold shade I'm going to line my
lower lash line with this with an e 15
from Sigma which is just the flat
definer brush and then to blend that out
we're gonna take the shade that we used
in the crease and just take a pencil
brush and go ahead and blend that out to
make it a little bit more smoky
they just want to fly my scary to your
bottom lashes and also line your
waterline with your black eyeliner
and then the eyes are done it's just a
really easy look I love the kind of
smokey golden look I think it's really
nice though now moving on the lips I'm
taking this Jordana lipstick which has
the ugliest packaging of life but we're
gonna let that go because the color is
beautiful and it lasts so well I don't
remember the name but I'll leave it down
below I love this you guys I think it's
like two dollars I got off of cherry
culture calm and it it's beautiful
great dupe for rebels so I'm going to
take this shade right here in the
Maybelline the nudes palette in a
highlight and then after you do that you
were officially done with the look so I
really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you all in my next video bye
selfie time
my
then you don't easy but just give it
time
Eva don't hurt now just wait just wait
