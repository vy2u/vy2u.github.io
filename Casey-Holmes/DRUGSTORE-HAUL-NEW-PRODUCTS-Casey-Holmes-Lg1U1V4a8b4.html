today I'm doing a drugstore makeup haul
which I'm so excited about I needed new
drugstore products in my life I haven't
actually been to the drugstore in a long
time actually that's a lie I went to
Ulta a couple weeks ago but I didn't
really see any new drugstore makeup so I
went online and looked up some different
brands that I have not tried before and
I got a few new products to share with
you guys that I'm really excited about I
just really loved affordable makeup so I
cannot wait to share these products with
you guys if you're wondering about this
makeup look I did film a tutorial on it
it will probably be up before this one
so I will link it down below or leave a
little card right here if you like this
kind of video don't forget to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe I'll have a link
right here and in the description box
below
I post three times a week Tuesdays
Thursdays and Sundays so if you want to
see all the new fun drugstore makeup
products that I have let's just go ahead
and get started okay so I have all of my
items in this little box and we're just
gonna dig in here so first thing I've
never tried this brand Catrice before
but I saw on online it looked really
interesting so this is a Catrice
cosmetics prime and fine
professional contouring palette so looks
like this I have to admit it's a little
bit smaller than I thought it was gonna
be but this is what it looks like I got
the shade warm harmony that's more true
to color right there so you have this
like yellow based highlighter it doesn't
look bad it just looks like more of a
sheen then you have this contour which
looks really really promising that's the
contour right there and then that's the
highlight the contour kind of reminds me
of benefit hoola but it's a little bit
more on the warm side it kind of has a
pinky undertone to it so we'll see how
it works to contour but I cannot wait to
try this out so the next thing is this
makeup revolution flawless ultra
eyeshadows palette the flawless flawless
to ultra eyes shadows palette so the
names are on this little sheet but this
is what they look like the pans are
pretty small but let's just put our
fingers in it this color is comet just
salt really smooth it's pretty it's
pretty right there you see it here's
another one this is a black
there's like a little swatch of those
three we'll just have to see how they
work
aya shadows from the drugstore are kind
of like a hit miss type of thing
sometimes they're just not pigmented
enough so hopefully these are next up I
got this for a dupes video so I'm not
gonna swatch if it is the L'Oreal
infallible eyeshadow and iced latte and
you guys wanted me to try this out as a
dupe for this Stila kitten so I'm going
to try this out on camera for you guys
but I know these eyeshadows are bomb so
I have nothing better though another
thing I bought for my dupes video is
this elf fake eyeshadow and enchanted
I'm gonna be trying this out with
another high-end product for you guys so
can't wait to see that's a dupe or not
then moving on we have another Catrice
item I think I've got a lot of Catrice
items because I've never tried anything
from them before but this is the
illuminating blush which looks really
pretty in the pan and it's called I am
nuts about you I'm not about you oh that
does look pretty right there
ooh just like looks like a little PD P
looks like a pretty pinky mom and it's
really smooth doesn't look too pigmented
but I'm okay with that because I usually
go for blush just like that for like
looks like this where I just want
something really subtle moving on I also
got a bronzer this is the Catrice Sun
glow matte bronzing powder this looked
good this is a nice sized pan too so
that's what it looks like oh my god it's
so pretty I only want to touch it this
is the shade deep bronze so that's it
right there
that looks so freakin pretty I cannot
wait to put this on my face you guys
know I've been obsessed with the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin bronzer in
number 30 I'm wearing it right now it's
just so beautiful but I can't wait to
put that to the test another thing I got
is this brush from Ecotools this is the
sheer finish kabuki and I think don't
try this out just for like blending
product you guys know I love my mu a duo
fiber brush but it says it's for light
sheer finish for powder or bronzer so
we'll see how it works it's super soft
and I really like the handle of it too I
also got this Catrice velvet and matte I
can't say that name
I also got this Catrice velvet matte lip
cream isn't that a pretty color okay
this is in the shade hazel Rose Royce
just I'll take a moment to silently pray
that this is a good liquid lip okay it's
more of like a mousse II feel with like
a cream
it's kind of sheer I don't know we'll
see you could see how sheer it is so oh
man the packaging is so cute I was
hoping it was gonna be really nice next
up we have the makeup revolution vivid
baked blush and this is the shade maple
make love instead I thought this said
make love inside or something I don't
know I don't know my mind went zero to a
hundred when I was trying to read this
the color looks like dand that looks so
pretty gives me some Mac marelize blush
feels ooh that looks so nice so that's
what looks like super pigmented and it
looks it looks real promising it looks
promising so that's it right there
that's stunning I also can't wait to try
this out this is again they could cheat
mm-hmm
every time sizing this is again the cat
East oh my god this is again from that
Catrice brand and it's the liquid
camouflage high coverage concealer got
the shade light beige it says it's
waterproof too we go and see ooh that
looks promising that's a swatch of it
right there except I'm going to try this
NYX invincible fullest coverage
foundation I got the shade medium beige
I think I've heard a few things about
this but I can't really remember it says
it has fantastic coverage that is satin
matte and flawless I'm down to try it
out this is pretty small it just does
have less product than the normal
foundation this has 0.85 fluid ounces
when a normal foundation would have one
fluid ounce so I hope this is good I
hope a little goes a long way and I
can't wait to try it out
I love trying new foundation speaking of
foundations I also got this Catrice
cosmetics all matte plus shine control
makeup it's mattifying long-lasting and
oil-free honestly I read this bottle and
I was like I have to have that I have to
try it I have to know this good stuff
and it says it's supposed to last up to
18 hours again for a night same brand
this is the camouflage cream and it's
just a little hot concealer it's sealed
up right now but it's just a little pop
concealer looks like this it's really
tiny the shade light beige I figured I
would try this out too and see which
concealer I liked better this one or
this liquid one oh you've got another
that thing oh I have a lot of shades so
hopefully these look better on the lips
with a lip liner or something because
there's such pretty colors
you guys haven't asked me to try this
off for the longest time it's the
essence make me brow eyebrow gel and a
lot of you want to see if this is a dupe
before the Gimme brow ooh it has fibers
in it it looks pretty damn promising so
that's what it looks like the essence
make me brow I got this liquid metal
eyeshadow from Catrice and the only
reason why I got this shade is because I
was looking online at these eyeshadows
and I saw this name Cetina
van der Woodsen so that Gossip Girl
reference pretty much sold me on this
product now let's see if it's good it's
feeling good look at that oh my okay now
I need to go get more colors that is
stunning that would even be pretty is
like a face highlight next up I got the
Catrice cosmetics prime and fine
mattifying powder and supposedly it's
waterproof and it is transparent
packaging is actually very very
beautiful and it's really thin so
they'll be great for your person I've
never heard of a waterproof powder
before so I'm gonna test it out but I
know I bought a lot of stuff from this
brand because they're super affordable
then I got this NYX no filter finishing
powder this just looked awesome online I
don't like the packaging I feel like
it's way too bulky you can kind of see
right there you can see how much space
there is in it but this is what it looks
like I got the shade medium olive and
basically it's just a finishing powder I
forget all the claims but it's supposed
to make you look freakin flawless like
absolutely flawless that's what it looks
like right there kind of like a mac
mineralize skinfinish in my opinion ooh
and it's super soft last drugstore
product we have is another makeup
revolution brand and this is the iconic
pro one oh yeah this is again for that
dupes video now I'm not going to swatch
these I'm just going to show you the
colors since I am gonna do a dupes video
but here's the Laura Pro and here's the
makeup revolution one they're both matte
I'm gonna do my fingers on it okay I
didn't wow these are big some of the
biggest eyeshadows I've seen from makeup
revolution
shut up no way if that doesn't look
identical as hell I don't even know oh
my god I am gonna fill my dupes video at
the beginning of next week so you will
see this in action very very soon but
I'm really excited to see if this is a
dupe
because the colors are literally the
exact same hey guys so that is it for my
drugstore makeup haul I hope you enjoyed
