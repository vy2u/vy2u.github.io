straight hair today it's just all up in
my grill it keeps going up here getting
my lashes like I can't deal really did
you not just blow that area that was
nice my camera just completely cut off
on me yeah I don't know I have no excuse
hey guys so today's video I have a
drugstore a haul for you guys I have
mainly makeup in here but I also have
like a couple different other things so
I figured I would show you because I
haven't been able to find any of the new
drugstore products that everybody has
been talking about lately and finally I
went to CVS again last week and they had
a bunch of new stuff figured I would
pick some stuff up and show it to you
guys there's a few things I'm really
excited about so yeah let's just go
ahead and get started ok so the first
big thing that I got is another Revlon
frost and glow honey highlighting kit
this is where I used to lighten the
bottom of my hair and a lot of you even
asking for a video and I will do one for
you guys really soon but I do love this
kit super easy to work with you just mix
the bleach and the developer together
and you're good to go by the way they do
have other colors of this but of course
I get the one for medium to dark around
here because that's what I got going on
okay next up we have this Rimmel
scandaleyes what are you called rockin
curves mascara and this is the ugliest
packaging I've ever seen in my life just
because I hate snakeskin but this is
what it looks like you can see it says
it has like a broken heart don't mind my
pinky I broke it and it hurts really bad
but it says I have a broken heart brush
which I guess that looks like a broken
heart I don't know this is the Loreal
brow stylist duet and this is in the
shade medium brown I am so excited about
this because you have a light shade and
or darker shade for your brows so that
way you can use this one on the first
half of your brows and then the darker
shade on the outer half of your brows
and hopefully it's good stuff that comes
with
and I believe this was pretty
inexpensive for two pencils and a
sharpener oh well it was nice and benign
but that's not bad for two pencils this
is something I'm super excited about I
haven't touched it or anything because I
want to know if you guys want a first
impression what do you want with this
palette let me know in the comments
below this is the Maybelline the nudes
palette so this is a newest palette that
they came out with and it is so pretty
I've never seen anything like this at
the drugstore like from Maybelline
L'Oreal those brands like NYX I know
have some but not like the Maybelline
brand let me know what you guys want me
to do with this palette I figured I
would save all the excitement for a
video if you can hear the mower guys or
leaf blower guys don't mind him next
thing I got was this Garnier clean a
nourishing cleansing oil and this says
it's for dry skin but I personally think
anybody can use cleansing oils
I have loyally skin and I've used
cleansing oils cleansing balms
everything like that but I figured I
would give this a try because you guys
know I do love like my bosha cool
cleansing oil I wanted to give this a go
Steve maybe it was a cheaper alternative
hopefully it takes off my makeup just as
well as the higher end ones but I will
definitely keep you guys updated on this
so another new thing is the L'Oreal
invisible lift blur foundation I'm a
little bit nervous to try this out
because it doesn't say oil free or
anything on here so I'm kind of thinking
this isn't going to be too great for
oily skin but I got the color Sutton
beige and I just figured why not try it
out and see how I like it so that's what
that looks like I like the packaging
squeeze you tube it just looks really
nice and sleek next up I got this
Maybelline what do you call it a master
causal kaj al oh I don't know how to say
that but it's a cream kohl eyeliner it's
a cone tip and luxurious oil for easy
glide it says it's waterproof and no
sharpener needed so you can see in the
packaging right here it's just that cone
shape so let's just open it up oh so
this is this is what it looks like at
first that's a big ol crayon then I have
to sharpen ever again I'm scared I would
break this oh that is super creamy
I've barely touched my skin and that's
how pigmented it is let's see see that
I'm
very touching so I'm guessing you have
to be really really really gentle with
this since it is so high up I'm gonna
just have like plastic around it so I'm
afraid it would break off so just be
careful with it but it looks interesting
next thing I got is this covergirl Ready
Set gorgeous concealer this is oil-free
I got the shade 115 to 120 this was
looking like it's a little too light for
me now that I'm home of course when I
get home I think it's too light but I've
seen a couple people use this concealer
and I thought it was really good
coverage so I want to try it out for
like underneath my eyes so the next
thing I got is out of its packaging
because I just got this like a couple
days ago and I've been using it because
I want to try a new one this is a
Maybelline eye studio gel liner in
blackest black and I've been using this
because I've noticed my Inglot gel liner
it has been like going onto my lid for
some reason like it smudges up there I'm
not sure what's going on but it's just
smudging and I don't like that so I've
been trying this one out it's supposed
to be waterproof so far I do like this
it doesn't smudge up to my upper lid or
anything like that doesn't get all over
the place and it stays on for a really
long time next thing I got was this a
Milani blush and Bella Rosa this is a
new matte shade that says on the side I
think this had been out for a little bit
now but like I said I haven't been able
to find them but dang this is payment a
look at that ooh girl gotta be careful
with this one oh gosh so that's super
pigmented
I mean gonna have to use a very very
light hand with this especially because
like it's super soft and creamy so I'm
gonna be careful with that that's a
super pretty color I like that I like
colors like this is a tan I think they
look really really pretty so the last
things I got worth lip products I got
quite a bit I got one two three four
five six seven eight nine nine lip
products so yeah I don't know I have no
excuse I was just like it's new why not
try it so the first thing I got these
aren't new but I've never tried them out
before these are the wet and wild mega
shield lip colors with SPF 15 in them
and I haven't played with these before
but I like the colors I especially like
this one right here
which is in the color peachy-keen and is
such a pretty nude look at that gorgeous
as a gorgeous Sheen to it and then the
next color I got is within these a dobla
walls whether these adobe walls
oh my god I'm probably making myself
look like idiots and they don't know how
to say that word but you know I can't
say it but that's this one so it's a
really pretty pink I do like that a lot
and they said great color payoff so I'm
super excited to try these out I think
they were like 2 or 3 bucks apiece I
mean probably cheaper and then I got
some new Rimmel lipsticks and this one
is actually from the Kate Moss
collection and I just haven't ever seen
this one so I just wanted to pick it up
because this is one of my favorite
colors ever this is in the shade 14
which is another gorgeous nude oh my
gosh this is beautiful it's right there
it has a purple undertone it is so
pretty and so different I'm just in love
with this shade love it love it love it
and I know most of the shades in her
line are matte but this one is not matte
so if you're wondering every mole came
out with like new packaging or whatever
I don't know if all of these colors are
new but I haven't seen them so I decided
to pick them up so this was all
packaging and this is a new packaging so
the first one is this nude called nude
delight I think this is a Poorna shade I
think I've seen this one before but I
don't have it it's a really pretty nude
that's it right there obviously I love
my nude you guys I can't get enough and
this does have a pink undertone to it
this one's my favorite nude it's called
7:20 Notting Hill nude which is just a
darker one oh my gosh yes I love it
that's my kind of color right there so
you can see it's just a darker nude
especially from that one and in this one
I literally swatched in the store and
this is the one that i swatched don't
worry and I was like oh my gosh it is
beautiful this is in the color 660 in
love with ginger oh my gosh this is a
hot hot fiery orange red
oh my gosh now just showing you this
watch right here oh my gosh is so
beautiful when i swatched that I was
like I cannot pass this up it is
beautiful
did pick up another Maybelline Color
elixir this is in the shade 30 luminous
lilac
I love these color lip stars they're my
favorite I know L'Oreal has some eye I
really love the Maybelline ones just
because I like the formula better so
this is that shade right there Wow super
pigmented very very pretty and if you're
not really into purple lipsticks or
anything like that and you want just
like maybe a subtle hint of purple this
would be the way to go yeah I just love
these I think they're really awesome and
the doe foot applicator on these bad
boys is amazing so if you still haven't
check these out you need to get your
hands on some because they're awesome
and then this is from the like celebrity
L'Oreal collection it's a collection
Prive by Eva this is Eva's new
whatever-the-hell the collection is
called I don't know but this is Eva's
nude is their name either Ava and I love
that color so really nice again a Mavi
nude very very pretty with a little bit
of brown in it I just love this it's
really gorgeous
then the last thing I've got which I'm
not very impressed with is this all may
lip gloss and I just I don't know I'm
never gonna fan of the brand all night I
just never have found anything from all
Mei that I really truly love other than
like their liquid eyeliner that's really
good I used to use it so much when I was
younger like that was my go-to liner I
probably went through like eight of them
there it was pretty bomb this is a gloss
called blooming balm and this is just a
really sheer wash of pink like it's not
much at all so that's it right there
it's a lot more pigmented on camera than
it actually is in person in person is
just a light wash of pink
it's like a clear gloss when you put it
on your lips so if I would have known
that I would have bought it but I'll
probably give this to my mom or
something so she can have it so that's
it for this drugstore haul I really hope
you all enjoyed it I'm going to try to
find more drugstore stuff because I told
you guys before that I want to do more
drugstore related videos it's just I
want to find new items like I'm not
inspired by the items I have right now
in my drawers from the drugstore so
that's why I want to buy new things and
show it to you guys just to have make it
more fun and like you know fun I don't
know so I really hope you guys enjoyed
this if you have any drugstore products
