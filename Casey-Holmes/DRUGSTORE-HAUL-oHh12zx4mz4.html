to be a tutorial but I ended up and
porting it on to my computer and it was
way too bright and I didn't want to al
it or upload it because I am trying to
upload things that I'm 100% happy with
and if I'm not happy with how something
turns out I'm not gonna upload it and
now you can see that I am like set up
differently in my room
so it just kind of takes some practice
to get the lighting down the way that I
want it so you know it didn't turn out
the way I wanted it to I'm kind of sad
about it but I figured I would just go
ahead and do this drugstore haul I've
had this stuff sitting over here for a
hot minute now okay so what we're gonna
do is get started with stuff that I
actually bought at the drugstore so not
online like I did 99 pretend this stuff
first off I'll start with these limited
edition pallets from Maybelline this one
is my favorite now let me go ahead and
tell you for fall I'm loving golds
forest green oranges so this is the
color get it once it desert fantasy this
is my favorite palette I have already
worn it is stunning I love it
you have a matte dark maybe a nice
forest green shimmer saying what this
one's a nice gold and then a champagne
kind of beige highlight stunning
stunning palette great pigmentation I
actually wore this the other night all
by itself and I loved it so I'm
definitely going to do a tutorial with
just this palette because it's really
beautiful I do have the gold in the
inner part of my eye on today and I just
love it I highly recommend these little
quanta manually and if you've never
tried them before because I think
they're great this one is something you
should get if you are a neutrals a lover
this is the fall temptation palette and
you do have a matte dark brown on this
end and then you just have a nice little
bronzy brown and then like a kind of
really light peach shade and then again
with another champagne highlight really
gorgeous like I said if you're a
neutrals kind of girl this is the
palette you would want to try and then
this one has more colorful eyeshadows in
it and it does not have a matte one in
here this is called autumn dream I just
thought was really pretty so I went
ahead and picked that one up and then
from riding I did get five new nail
polishes this is called for the twill of
it it's just a beautiful duochrome nail
polish I don't know if you're gonna be
able to see how stunning it is but it's
so pretty if you see it in stores
definitely snatch it up I mean it is so
pretty it looks just like it did in the
magazine and I cannot wait to wear this
show you guys what's on my nails right
nail the first color which is this one
is Julie G's nail polish in stiletto and
this reminds me of an Essie nail polish
I can't remember the name but it looks
just like it so wearing that one and
then I also got this one up this one but
this one this is like a lime gold color
and I really like the colors together
it's kind of different you wouldn't
really expect somebody to pair the two
together but I think they look pretty
cool so I like them and they haven't
chipped it on they've been on here for a
couple days now with this color that I
have on my ring finger is called shimmer
Island like I said it's like a lime gold
shimmer it's really really pretty I like
it a lot and then another shimmer that I
got is this bronze kind of color and
this is called metallic heels
thanks hazel from Julie gee they're from
Julie Jay's nail polish line she does
have really great colors I like them a
lot and then the last one is a glitter
nail polish
called Cleopatra's Cobra and I will say
this this is not opaque at all okay
moving on I did get stuff from beauty
joint calm mainly because I'm weighing
more Jordana products I'm a huge Jordana
fan and they came out with some new
stuff so I wanted to pick this stuff up
because a lot even asked me about it but
what I'm going to do is just pull from
the top and give it to show you guys
okay there's a good stuff
here and I just kind of want to outline
dig for anything so the first thing I
thought is this Jordana pressed powder
and I got this in a darker shade because
I figured I could contour or bronze with
it honestly looked a lot lighter online
this isn't the color warm honey oh gosh
but it is very very very very very dark
I know I think I'll be good as a bronzer
or a contour shade I'm gonna have to
just play with it the powder is very
soft I kind of want to get one in my
shade to see how well the powder you
know stays on and looks on the skin and
then I got some palette as well I did
pick up another wet and wild vanity
palette just because I love this palette
I think if you are just starting out
with makeup and you want something nice
multifunctional you should definitely
try this and then I did pick up another
Butwell palette like that this one's
called lust and I don't want to try this
one out for a while so I just went ahead
and picked it up because I really like
the colors in it and then I did pick up
a NYX love in Paris palette this one's
in column sis sis la vie
it's 0-6 I don't know but I find that
these are kind of hard to open oh maybe
not the best of those colors look like
again really gorgeous fall shades and I
love the greens that are in this one so
I'm excited to try it out hopefully it
has great pigmentation okay I did pick
up another Rimmel stay matte mainly
because I tried this a long time ago and
I did not like it at all but I was like
you know things changed like I'll try
different things as the you know months
go on I'll like it again or I won't like
it
so three I just try it again this is a
natural I thought I was gonna be a
little bit darker online but it's not so
we'll see how I like that I did go ahead
and pick up the Rimmel wake me up
concealer and four great things about it
this is in light so hopefully this is
good stuff because I've heard really
great things about it I have seen this
in the drugstore and I just they didn't
have my color or when I went to Walmart
they were all like picked through and
like open and stuff so
no I'm not buying that I got a lot of
pencil stuff and liners so we'll just
get started I did get a backup of my
Jordana fabula in black because it's my
favorite black liner and then I also
picked up a Jordana fabula in brown
because since I love the black so much I
was like I might as well just pick up a
brown color so I did get the brown a I'm
wearing it I do like it so then Jordana
came out with these new 12-hour liners
but I did get these these are the
12-hour made to last liquid eyeliner
pencils hopefully they are good stuff I
got one an aqua which is this little guy
J jewel which is this a nice forest
green of course I had to get black and
then this is called purple fix which is
just a nice dark purple they are very
creamy
when I wash them on my arm they were
very pigmented when I left him on after
about I say 10 to 15 minutes I went to
go and rub them and they didn't smudge
so that's a good thing I have not wear
the moment waterline yet that's really
the true test but so far the swatches
they seem good now different story for
these little guys this is the 12 hour
mates last eyeshadow pencils and I got
one in endless emerald which is a green
and then prolonged purple I did use this
on my eye yesterday I actually use the
green one and it just it creased so bad
on me I had a primer underneath and
everything and I even said it with
shadow and it creeps so bad I have oily
eyelid so it is hard for products like
these to work for me
same thing happen with these though I
swatch them after about 12 to 15 minutes
you might rub them and they didn't rub
off but on my eyes there was a
completely different story so I'm
probably going to give these away to a
family member now I did get these to
twist and shine moisturizing balm stays
I got the nude chick which is just a
nude color I think let's see right there
it is pretty I like it over a lipstick I
don't like it
myself and this does have shimmer in it
by the way and I got the color tropical
frenzy this one does not have shimmer
and it's a pretty pink color so I like
them so far they're nice and I don't
have a minty smell which is what I love
because I don't like products with minty
smells or tastes
unless it's of gum because I just I
don't know I don't like that for some
reason and then I did get two NYX lip
liners I got one in deep red and red
wait what is this
deep purple so I want to do ombre lips
with the deep red and then have the deep
purple for any purple lipsticks I have
then I cannot find the cement store I
think it was discontinued I'm not sure I
know people raved about it so much back
in the day it's Rimmel's airy-fairy and
I do like this nude I think it is
stunning so that's what it looks like
right there it's a great like everyday
color because it's like a pinky nude so
pretty but the smell it's kind of smells
like play-doh
and then I did get four lipsticks I got
three from wet and wild so this one is
called don't blink pink I'm just gonna
swatch these on my hand now because you
can see in the camera because they're
super pigmented so that one is don't
blink pink this one is cherry pickin
which is gonna be perfect for fall it's
stunning I don't have any of these
colors in my Walgreens either for some
reason I can't find them not even in my
CVS this one's a dupe for Viva Glam
Nikki this is called peak herbal pick a
swatch in this kind of color I like to
mix with others I don't really like to
use these on their own so they're really
nice though they seem really creamy like
not too matte or anything so I do like
these a lot
oh and I did get one more lipstick this
is from Jordana and this like hideous
looking tube but I'm going to try this
is called eggplant and it's just a nice
deep plum so for fall that would be
really pretty it's a very vampy color
but that packaging no man look at that
and then the last two things I got were
again from Jordana I just got the grain
stuff all over this one the green shadow
stick but they're two blushes
was in sandalwood which I don't really
like I'll give this all the way to its
really light it does a show on my skin
there's no point of us watching it
because it looks like a plain pastel
color on my skin I will never wear this
song again this one wave somebody but it
did look darker online as well and then
I got this color it's called classic
bronze I think it's will really be
really pretty again for bronzing or
contouring
it's just that perfect kind of shade I
think more for contouring because it is
pretty pretty dark yeah that's a nice
shade I like it it's all right down
there but that is it for my hot I hope
you enjoyed it I am sorry that I
couldn't get the tutorial up today but I
promise I will work on it tomorrow and
try to get it for you as soon as
