I would do a last-minute holiday makeup
look using all drugstore products so if
you wanted to recreate this look you go
Ulta Walgreens wherever these are sold
and pick them up and recreate this look
you also have a lot of different
drugstore products in this video that
I'm so excited about so excited to try
and yeah you guys will just see it in
the video yeah I hope you guys enjoy
this don't forget to subscribe before
you leave so if you guys can see my
drugstore holiday makeup look then let's
go ahead and get started so I actually
just wash my hair I put it up for you
guys I'm gonna be using these shadow
shields believe you can get these at the
drugstore I've seen them somewhere at
the drugstore but these are like just
little shadow things you could use
scotch tape which is what I use all the
time you don't have to have this
specific brand but first I am going to
go ahead and prime I'm gonna be using
the Maybelline master Prime a long
lasting eyeshadow primer this is a nice
little base that's affordable and it
works on my oily eyelids so I just been
using this one this year and I really
like it I think it works great so I'm
going to open up this kit I did get this
kit Ulta it was $20 excise shadows
liquid lip and a matte eyeliner and then
this picture just looks so pretty so I
knew I had to have it
I'm gonna go in with this shade right
here and put this all over my lid just
to set that primer that we put on and
give us like a nice even base
I honestly might end up ripping off this
little plastic sheet and putting all the
sticky part down because this is a good
one bother me lid we have a few
different I show options in this video
this is gonna be one that I'm using
mainly in the crease and stuff like that
but then on the lid I have like this
Palladio crushed metallic eyeshadow in
the shade so list then I have this
L'Oreal infallible eyeshadow and iced
latte which is like a classic everybody
loved that one first thing I'm gonna do
actually is I'm going to take my bronzer
which is this number seven bronzer in
the shade caramel and I'm going to put
this into my crease as my transition
shade because there aren't really I mean
there are some transition shades you can
use in here but there's just a little
too dark for me so I'm gonna go in with
this one and pop back into the crease
and kind of work that all over just as a
nice transition shade something to help
fade it up towards the brow this number
seven bronzer is really good we're gonna
be using this today to bronze our skin
but if I have like no time I will throw
this into my crease and that will be my
eye shadow for the day it's like my
favorite thing to do is throw bronzer in
the crease just to create some
definition and then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go into this shade right
here and I'm going to put this one into
my crease it's a really pretty color I
don't know how this is
oh it's nice so I'm just gonna toss this
in here
it's not to to to dark which I like one
of those colors you can build up to be a
little bit more on the deep side this is
gonna be pretty much an easy look we're
gonna do this one in the crease and I
want to do this like on my lower lash
line because it's just so pretty and I
want it to pop I feel like if I put it
on the lid like blending in the crease
or like a little bit on the lid I don't
know maybe I'll try it I feel like it'll
get lost but I'll definitely try it out
and see because I want the green to
stand out because it is the holidays and
this is not like a intense in-your-face
kind of green it's very wearable in my
opinion and I love green eyeshadows like
all of eyeshadows are some of my
favorites okay
so we're just really making sure it's
nice and blended this is a really pretty
color then I'm going to go into this
green shade I'm gonna use the same brush
and we'll just see how this looks on the
lid I kind of want to take it like half
way that is such a pretty green
eyeshadow I really love I haven't even
gotten far with that oh my gosh that is
so pretty it's so wearable but you can
totally tell it's green and I'm going in
with a fluffy brush and if you wanted
this like more intense you could take
like a flat brush that is so pretty you
guys oh my god I want to take this all
over my lid now just tossing this into
the crease as well I'm gonna go back in
with my first brush and I'm just going
to lightly go over the edges of this
we're gonna also gonna go back over it
with that mauve shade that we used I'm
gonna take a different brush going with
that middle shade and just put that back
into the crease so we don't lose it the
green is still gonna be the star of the
show but I don't want to lose that Moff
color they also have this really pretty
green shimmer in here but I don't want
to use that that's kind of I'm kind of
like just going with these shades right
here so I really want to try out this
pull audio crushed metal eye shadow it
just seems so pretty and I feel like
gold in this look would be really really
nice so I'm gonna take a flat brush just
a flat shader brush I'm gonna take the
Mac 242 which is one of my favorite
brushes for all over lid colors or like
corner colors I'm just gonna dip my
brush in here whose really pigmented
that metallic shadow is actually so
pretty guarantee if you went with your
finger with this because look at how
stunning it that is I mean for a really
affordable metallic eyeshadow not bad at
all I'm actually gonna try to take my
pinky on here
this is no fix plus no glitter glue
nothing I obviously have too long of
nails for this but it's so pretty I love
this and then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go back into this green shade I'm
gonna lightly just over the edges of
that just to really make the grain pop
might need a fluffy brush
that's super pretty oh my god I love it
I think it looks really good so I'm
gonna just take this off look at that
easy-peasy done now I'm gonna try out
the eyeliner in it and this is the NYX
matte liquid liner I think I've tried
this before just because I try to get my
hands on all eyeliners from the
drugstore that I say that their matte I
don't even like brush tip so that was so
easy to do a winged eyeliner I really
want more of those mix sets I wonder if
they have these cosmic metals I think
I'm gonna look up and see if I can get
more of these because I really like the
way that turned out same with these
Palladio little guys any more of these
crushed metallic eyeshadows is really
good and then I'm gonna apply these
lashes I've never tried them before but
they're dramatic I love dramatic lashes
and they just cut right on my alley
there from kiss and their last couture
faux mink lashes and they look really
intense but I think I think I can do it
I think I can do it so I'm gonna quickly
apply these and I'm gonna come back on
and we will move on to our face okay so
those kiss lashes they'll ban is super
thin on the lashes it's really flexible
it's not like a heavy band I think I'm
gonna love these lashes and I think
before I upload this video I'm gonna
have to order more so I'm just gonna let
me get a little bit tacky and while it's
doing that I'm going to apply primer I'm
gonna be using this L'Oreal infallible
Matlock primer this is a new one for me
I've been trying it out I will be honest
I don't notice the biggest difference in
staying matte but that could be because
I've been trying new drugstore
foundations and new foundations in
general I'm just going to plop this on
my skin I will say it's nice because it
doesn't like dry out your skin which is
really important when it comes to
magnifying primers feels really good
it's nice and smooth it doesn't get
tacky or anything kind just feels like a
lotion and I was gonna use my Maybelline
Dream matte mousse today but I think I
want to play with this I've not played
with this before this is the flower
beauty EE erase everything ultimate
foundation says it feels an uneven skin
texture of fine lines while hydrating
the skin apply the cream like balm for a
silky matte finish like diffusing
pigments blur out skin imperfections
while smoothing complexion use alone for
a fresh look or as a primer before you
use your favorite flower makeup oh I
didn't use this as a primer or
foundation so we'll see what the
coverage is like if it's not the best
then we will go in with that Maybelline
Dream matte mousse I'm just gonna apply
this that's yellow on this side taking
that Ecotools sponge I'm just going to
tap it out
see this looks like on one side of my
face it's definitely more of a matte
finish okay I think this is a squeezy
tube cuz now it's coming out like a
squeeze no no people use it as a primer
necessarily they're still redness
peeking through I feel like it's
enhancing my texture it's very blotchy
um don't really like that moving on -
I'm gonna meet using the dream matte
mousse foundation on my face actually
even maybe even a little bit of a better
color match but I would recommend like a
flat top kabuki brush with this
foundation I feel like it's just quicker
and it just blends really well I think
this can work as like a primer but I
wouldn't necessarily prefer it this
isn't my favorite thing to be honest
with you I don't think it provided
enough coverage for me I wouldn't use
this again but I will tell you that
their tinted moisturizer is literally
like a foundation and it has some of the
best coverage I've ever seen and it
makes my skin look so good so if you
want to try like a face product from
them and you kind of have the same skin
texture or you have the same problems as
me I would definitely try that out over
this one I'm going in with two different
concealers I'm going to use the Ulta
full-coverage liquid concealer here and
the inner part of my eye this is super
super light so I don't like to use this
all over my face also gonna do it down
center of the nose I'm gonna take the
Maybelline better skin in the shade
light and put that on the outer part
this one just has a little bit of a
better color you didn't think I really
liked the sponge but I've been using it
more and more and to be honest it's kind
of winning my heart to notice with you I
like the edge of it and I like that this
is a flat edge you know there's some
people that I have the flat edge like
this but it's much thinner
this one is a little bit of a thicker
edge can you see that it's just a little
bit thicker on the ends there you go
you can see how wide it is and I just
feel like it really actually blends out
the product like some of them you know
have that really thin pointed tip and
I'm like what am I gonna do with that
what am I gonna do that that doesn't
blend out anything on me the old two one
is definitely a little bit more of a
difficult concealer to blend but it does
have really nice coverage so now I'm
gonna take this smaller precise brush
and I'm just gonna go in here and blend
this out there but the dogs and I'm
really bringing this in this inner
corner because your girl is tired and it
is showing so we're gonna cover that up
oh we are highlighted I'm gonna go on
with this la girl pro powder this is in
the shade banana yellow this is a really
great powder actually went through a
whole tub of this so this is repurchase
and I think it is one of the best
drugstore powders out there just need
something to you know make your skin
look really good but keep you matte and
set you this is like one of the best and
it has a really great color it's not too
yellow it's not like that translucent
it's just a really really really great
powder so I'm going to shake it up
actually gonna do a little bit of baking
today that's what it looks like in this
little top parts a little bit deeper so
it's not like it's overflowing the
moment you you know take the top off so
I'm just gonna take my Ecotools sponge i
I'm going to bake today so I can never
bake anymore do people like bake a lot
anymore do you guys see a lot of people
do that in tutorials I hate like never
do it anymore
but I just got Patrick Starr's new
powder and it made me want to bake more
so I've been baking and I'm gonna let
that sit for just a few minutes but
while that is sitting I'm gonna go and
move on to my brows I'm going to use
this Milani stay put brow color does the
smashbox precise brow and liner i don't
know how i'm gonna love this because
i've never used it before the only thing
that's different with this brush and the
Sephora brand brush outing is it's a
little bit thinner and i guarantee it is
a little bit more precise
as the name States I do like this brush
but I need a spoolie on the end of my
brushes because every time filling my
brows I'm always going back and forth
between the spoolie and the bristle side
because I am NOT using this benefit brow
pencil right now but I'm just gonna take
a spoolie and brush through we might go
in and put some concealer on after we're
done
dusting away this bake but I'm just
dusting it away all that baking that we
did and I'm really working that powder
into the skin and dusting it on the
other parts of my face that need powder
going in with the number seven bronzer
right now and I'm actually gonna use
this Tarte brush because I really like
it right now so I'm just gonna bronze
skin take it off my forehead leaving a
little bit of highlight in there
and I'm going to my brush and just blend
or contour I'm going to be using in the
physician's formula bronze booster I'm
going to use the middle shade oh we use
militate in this palette right here the
more ashy tone to contour my cheeks just
again a mini use is a little turbid
Neeta
I'm gonna be using at this Palladio
matte blush in the shade botanical
invite no booth or Dana : vitamin
infused no it's in the shade chic okay I
was literally the reading like all the
descriptions whatever it's in the shade
chic and this is my kind of color this
is a color that goes with like literally
any look I've used pull audio matte
blushes before but never the shade so
I'm very excited kind of matches my
sweater by the way if you're wondering
where this is from it's really old
I got this oh my god I've had this since
I lived in my apartment and I posted a
photo of me and this with long dark hair
and my old apartment would like my shoe
background oh my god throwback we want
to just take this little brush from
Smashbox and I'm going to dust this on
my cheeks I love these kind of colors
because I feel like it gives you a
bronzy feel and it doesn't necessarily
look like blush even though I'm a blush
fan I love blush but you can apply quite
a bit of it I know it looks like bronzer
I love its color I'm packing this for
when we leave so I have quite a bit of
highlight things to talk to you guys
about because L'Oreal came out with a
whole lumi glow line they have these
lumi glow lotions which you can use on
your body they have two pallets they
have a moon kissed which is this one
right here and then they also have sun
kissed which is more of the golden tones
great for deeper skin tones they have
two shades they have this really gold
color which is mo8 golden hour that just
sounds so pretty so here's golden hour
and then we also have a day break right
here I'm gonna actually swatch these for
you guys because I was really impressed
when I first washed them so the lighter
shade is definitely more pink which
normally is not my kind of shade but
just you wait you wait till you see
these and then i don't think i've
swatched golden hour so I'm gonna put
this on my so golden hour is definitely
more golden but you could even probably
mix the two and get a really gorgeous
glow
so you
see that's what they look like I feel
like this one's definitely more
reflective so what I'm actually gonna
try today is mixing the two and putting
them on before I put on a powder
highlight just because I really want to
try these so bad and just see if they
look okay over powder I'm just gonna put
this on the high points of my cheeks do
you see that I think this is pretty but
I don't think it's very reflective and
it honestly looks like you can't even
blend it out it looks like it blends
away I don't know if you guys could see
pretty much that hole right there so I'm
gonna try this little palette right here
these honestly might be good just for
your body you know mixing in with your
lotion or things like that but they also
have the glow lotions that you could use
these are not super intense they're
definitely more of a really nice sheen I
mean they're nice to have instead of you
know using your expensive highlighters
to highlight your body I'm going to be
trying out this moon kissed palette and
I'm going to use my Anasazi brush and I
really want to dip into this shade right
here so I'm gonna take it with my Aussie
a brush and we're just gonna plop that
on okay
that is pretty
I think it shows quite a bit of texture
but it is pretty but it was on top of
those other products so is it not gonna
be intense out there we go
see that the lighter one looks like too
I think that's nice I don't think it's
terrible do I think there's possibly
better out there
sure but I'm not obsessed I really feel
like they just kind of blend away I
think if you combined which it would be
I feel like a lot of money to do this
but if you combined these two I think
they would be gorgeous on top of each
other like combining daybreak and moon
kiss because they kind of go together
the palate is not terrible but it's
definitely not my favorite and my
foundation is like coming off where that
dang cream product was I want to take a
little bit of this one too who is this
this is Milani strobe like in Sun glow
damn just go it's in the Lonnie dang if
you're gonna buy a drugstore highlighter
just get this one that wow that was
pretty
I'm very highlighter I can't try anymore
highlighters on I also really quickly
want to mention these two to you guys
about both of these because I didn't
know how they would look they're both
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi shimmer ISTA
aluminate highlight strobe powders this
one's in the shade 505 moonlight again
and this has a very iridescent glow to
it which for me you know I'm not you can
see how iridescent like it's more purple
blue so this is not something that I
personally like it's very like in person
this is a very purple blue highlight and
then we also have the shade sunlight as
well this one's really pretty like look
at how pretty that it I think deeper
skin tones is are gonna rock that but
these aren't really nice they have a
really great formula and I feel like out
of all the things from the globe
collection you'll probably like this one
best and this one has quite a bit of
product in it I'm gonna highlight
underneath my brow bone and I'm actually
gonna use that same Milani
highlighter and we're just gonna hit
that high point of the brow and blend
out so focus it mainly right here under
the arch do this freaking highlighter is
like a new favorite also flower Beauty
has really great highlighters as well I
mean they are
intense I was gonna use them tables like
nah I need to try some new stuff out so
I'm going to be using at this Maybelline
lasting a drama waterproof eyeliner I'm
going to be putting this on the inner
rim of my upper lash line I can't stand
it when I can see the skin of my upper
water line underneath lashes because it
just kind of takes away from it so I
always love to do that I think it's
great going back into that NYX palette
I'm going to use that green shade I'm
gonna take this flat definer brush and
use that color and pop this right there
at that lower lash line really close and
kind of dragging it out this is pretty
much like the focal point of the lower
lash line then I'm going to take my
bronzer again with a pencil brush and
I'm going to blend out the edges of that
green just the very edges cuz I don't
want to lose that green
and it also adds some warmth back into
that lower lashline
we are some mochi de-iced but not least
I want a red lip with this look just to
kind of give it a Christmas vibe and
make it even more dramatic this is the
adult in did a flower beauty lip product
that I talked about a few videos back it
has like a gloss and a lipstick and at
one too so I'm just gonna use the
lipstick side oh my die this is such an
intense red but I live for it and this
lasts so long
okay guys so my hair is done and this is
the final super glam makeup look that is
using all drugstore products I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video I had
so much fun filming it hope you guys
have a very Merry Christmas
and enjoy your time with family your
friends whatever you're doing for the
holiday and I will see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
