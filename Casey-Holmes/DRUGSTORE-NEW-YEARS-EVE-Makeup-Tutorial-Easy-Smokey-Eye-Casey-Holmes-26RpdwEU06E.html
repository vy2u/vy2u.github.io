these videos and feel comfortable like
hey guys
so at today's video is going to be a
drugstore New Year's Eve of makeup look
now I know I've been talking about doing
a look with the newest Urban Decay
eyeshadow I got recently in downward dog
what is it no are we talking a guy I
can't remember the name of it see I was
gonna use this and eyeshadow from Urban
Decay it's the yeah Diamond dog not down
her top I've been talking about using
this for a while now for a New Year's
Eve look but it came down to the nitty
gritty and you know I'm running out of
time and only have time for one New
Year's Eve look because it's tomorrow so
I mean I gotta edit this and everything
tonight I just wanted to do it's
something that you could conveniently go
to your drugstore and get some of these
products if you wanted to try this look
out so I did use all drugstore products
I hope you guys don't mind me not using
this I will definitely be using it soon
though for another dramatic look but I
figured let's just let's just keep it
classic let's do a classic smoky eye
with some gold in the inner corner the
blush and stuff I use everything I just
in this video I really truly love I
really hope you enjoyed this video if
you're going out for New Year's please
be safe enjoy your time but think right
and just be safe please and I hope you
all have an amazing time with your
family and friends however you bring me
in the new year I just quickly want to
say thank you guys so much I'm gonna get
emotional thank you guys so much for
making 2014 such an incredible year for
me I'm almost at 800,000 subscribers
which is really insane and honestly it's
just this has been one of the best years
of my life with
small things and work so much has
changed for me and so much has made me
such a better person and really just
life is just good and a lot of that is
thanks to you guys so thank you so much
for your continuous support and I really
don't think I could tell you enough so
thank you thank you thank you I love you
I can't wait to see what 2015 brings and
I can't wait to just bring in the new
year
oh my god I'm getting emotional so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video please
give it a thumbs up if you did enjoy it
and yeah I'll see you guys in the new
year bye okay so we're gonna start out
this is already got one eye done and
yeah we're just gonna cut the time in
half well not really but I'm gonna take
the Ulta eyeshadow and sable it's a
great mid-tone of brown color perfect
for a transition shade and it blends
really easily you do have to build the
color up but I mean honestly it doesn't
take any time so just build that color
up into the crease this is gonna be our
transition shape to help everything
blend up to the brow taking the
Maybelline the nudes palette when take
this black in here and pack this all
over the lid do you want to be extra
dramatic and take an extra step you can
also use a liner as a base sometimes I
find that when I apply too much product
to my lid it starts going into the
crease no matter what primers I use or
anything like that so I don't tend to
put down a creamy base before hand like
a liner or something like that because
it really tends to smudge and get
everywhere so I'm just going to put that
black down and then I'm gonna go in with
the second shade I showed you guys in
the palette which is just a nice kind of
taupey brown and I'm gonna blend that
into the crease this whole section is
all about adding more black blending
adding more black and then blending
again so just take your time with it and
it looks a little crazy
until you're honestly completely done
with the makeup look but just keep
adding color and blending and I promise
you you'll get it how you want it and
then I'm taking this Revlon Photoready
liner and I like this liner a lot it's
very creamy it does kind of smudge a
little bit but it's not a bad thing it's
good for what I'm using it for right now
I'm gonna actually just line the upper
lash line and then we're going to smudge
it out with the other end of the pencil
and this is just going to define the
eyes
so we're not doing a wings line or
anything like that and then I'm also
gonna line my upper waterline with this
as well I'm also gonna apply these
lashes from velour feel free to use any
lashes you want I didn't have any at my
local drugstore that I wanted to get so
I just used these but use whatever your
favorite lashes are and then I'm going
in with NYX angel veil primer and then
this Revlon foundation this is one of
the newer foundations that just came out
I love this you guys it has great
coverage about medium to full coverage
it is buildable and it goes to a semi
matte finish so for my oily skin babies
you might want to give this one a try
and then I'm going in with this
Maybelline and master concealer this I
find you kind of have to work pretty
quickly with cuz it kind of sets pretty
quickly I'm actually surprised about it
so I'm just going in with my Beauty
Blender and quickly blending that out
this is a great concealer by Maybelline
that they did a great job on this then
i'm taking this nyx concealer palette
and one of the lightest shades in there
and i'm taking the more yellow toned and
i'm just going to put this in the center
of my nose this is a great dupe for the
mac pro and conceal palette that i have
so if you're looking for a cheaper
alternative you'll love that and then
taking this elf eye brightener i'm just
going to set all that concealer that i
put on my face in place and it's just a
yellow tinted powder and it's just gonna
set everything and also kind of brighten
up the face as well then I'm taking this
BH Cosmetics would be a bombshell
bronzer I'm just gonna put this where I
regularly put my bronzer on the top of
the forehead cheekbones and jaw and then
I'm gonna take this NYX blush in taupe
this is a nice taupey color and it's
great to contour with because it does
add that dimension and shadow to the
face
then I'm going to take one of my
favorite blushes this is from the elf
blush kit and it's in light and I'm
taking the shade I just showed you and
I'm going to put this on my cheeks it's
a very nice warm shade these blushes are
so pigmented and they blend very very
very well definitely give these blush
palette to go I got mine off line a
while back and I also love the dark
palette as well then I'm taking the
Physicians Formula highlight I'm not
sure what shade it is it fell off when I
ripped off the packaging but I'm just
going to highlight my cheekbones with
this and down the center of my face as
well then taking this NYX eyebrow gel I
just filled in at my brows and set them
in place with this L'Oreal product I've
been loving these two products they are
amazing especially the NYX brow gel man
that stuff is good and I love love love
the color now I'm gonna take the creamy
kind of pink shade in the palette it's
matte and I'm gonna highlight with this
I didn't want to do a shimmer so I'm
just gonna go ahead and put that
underneath my brow going back in with
that revlon liner i'm just going to line
my waterline since this is gonna be a
really dramatic look and then taking
that black again I'm going to line right
underneath the lower lash line I used an
angled brush but I really wish I could
have found my Sigma e 15 because it
would have been so much easier to just
really smoke out this bottom lash line
but I'm going to put that on the bottom
lash line and then go ahead and go back
and with that second color right there
and just going to blend this out these
colors surprisingly blend really really
well
I like this Maybelline the nudes palette
it's a great affordable palette and you
can do quite a few looks with this so
I'm just gonna go ahead and blend this
all out so there's not a harsh line
underneath there and then I'm just going
to put on my lower mascara I'm using the
l'oreal miss manga and i love this
mascara i like to use it even when i
dont have false lashes on cuz it's
amazing and now I'm moving on to the
gold part I'm going to take this gold in
the palette and just put this in the
inner corner it's just gonna brighten it
up a little bit and add a little extra
color you can't really see these colors
that well on camera I really kind of
feel bad about it because I don't know
what was going on but my camera just
really didn't pick up the smoke
well as I wanted it to the colors were a
little bit deeper than what they're
appearing on camera so I'm taking this
Milani lip liner and lining my lips and
filling them in and then going in with
this Sonia Kashuk lipstick I'm gonna put
that on and then top it off with this
L'Oreal gloss it just gives a nice kind
of mid-tone nude and then you are done
with this look I hope you guys enjoyed
it thank you so much for watching Happy
New Year and please give this a thumbs
up and don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
