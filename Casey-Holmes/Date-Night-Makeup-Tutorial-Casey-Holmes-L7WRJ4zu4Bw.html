on at this makeup look and I told you
guys a couple videos ago that I wanted
to do a date night makeup look and I
wanted to know if you guys want to see
it and a lot of you said yes so that is
what I did for you today I have lots of
romantic colors in it and I feel like
it's really flirty but still glam at the
same time because I know when I go on a
date I don't always like to be super
natural I kind of like to glam it up and
have fun getting ready and just get
excited for the date so I really hope
you enjoy this I actually had Davis on
the phone at the end of this video in
the tutorial and he said he really liked
this look a lot so it's boyfriend
approved it should be date approved and
I didn't include this hair by the way in
this video it was very last minute
thrown find of you know I don't know all
over the place but I really hope you
enjoy it if you do like this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up you guys
have been showing so much love with a
thumbs up and I can't thank you enough
because it's really easy to see what
kind of videos you like when you thumbs
it up so yeah if you want to see how to
get this makeup look then let's just get
started okay so today we're using the
Naked 3 palette and I'm gonna take the
color strange and put that all over my
lid and then I'm gonna take the color
limit and put this into my crease as our
transition shade now I love the matte
colors in this palette but I was pretty
disappointed when I touched into the
shimmery shades I just want to go ahead
and pull warn you I wanted a really
pretty shimmery lid but that just didn't
happen with this palette so I'm gonna
take nooner right now and then take it
with a really precise brush this one's
from makeup geek and I'm gonna put it
directly into the crease not going above
the transition shade and not going on
the lid I'm also kind of drawing the
crease line up above my natural crease
just to help make my eyes look a little
bit bigger and look like I have a lot
more lid space then I'm gonna take black
out almost like burn out oh no it's
black part I'm going to take black heart
and I'm gonna take a really precise
brush and put this again into the crease
going right below a nooner and we're
just doing this to really define that
crease area and smoke it out but it's
not gonna be too smoky it adds just
enough definition and just enough
sexiness for a date night but it's not
overpowering like a smokey eye would be
so I'm just gonna put this into the
crease like I said with a small precise
brush then i'm taking a nooner again and
I'm gonna take a pencil brush and blend
this out take your time with it it does
take a little while to blend out
Blackheart
then what you do it's a beautiful color
so I love it I like to pull up my brow
just a little bit to help blend it out
and I like using this Mac pencil brush
I've talked about Mac pencil brushes
before but I just really really enjoy
them I think they blend out color
amazingly and they're by far the best
pumps pencil brushes I can't talk
best pencil brushes I've ever used then
I'm gonna take the color trick and this
was the color that I was hoping would be
super pigmented and gorgeous but it just
didn't live up to my standards I was so
upset so I ended up taking a mug shot
and putting it over top and then I did
the same exact thing on the other side
so I put trick down first and then
moonship mug shot all over top of it and
I ended up liking the way that it looked
I just wish it was shimmery ER and a
lighter color so I was kind of
disappointed in the shimmery shades in
this palette and it kind of reminded me
why I never use it so then I'm going in
with the Make Up For Ever liner and I'm
just gonna do a winged eyeliner and I
was pretty proud of them today I'm not
gonna lie then I'm using the velour
lashes and fluff doll me up I believe
they're called they're a fluffier pair
of the Dom Mia flashes which I love and
then when using a regular primers and
then the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation I have not used a beauty
blender and so long for my foundation
but when I used it this night I realized
I like applying this foundation a hell
of a lot more with a brush I just think
it looks a lot better
but then I also used the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer and went ahead and
put that on the area's I wanted to
highlight so underneath my eyes and the
center of my face and again blended it
out with this beauty
now I'm going to take the cup on D shade
and light palette and using this yellow
tone powder right here I'm going to set
all of the concealer that I just applied
to my face and then I'm going to take a
more warm shade in that Kat blending
palette I'm just going to bronze my face
with this really lightly I'm not doing
like a really intense bronze or contour
I'm just warming up the face and then
putting a little bit of contour on just
to define the face a little bit more and
help make my cheekbones stand out so to
contour it I'm gonna take the more a
sheer tone in here and just very lightly
put this underneath my cheekbones and
underneath my bottom lip then I'm taking
this color by Mac and this isn't
cantaloupe this is a beautiful blush
every time I use that I'm like yes this
is why I purchased it because it is so
stunning I love it so I put a lot on and
then I blend away with a duo fiber brush
and I just love how warm it makes my
skin look it's so beautiful and then I'm
taking the benefit Watts up highlighter
and I'm applying this to my face and if
you guys have seen in Sephora I'm
actually on the benefit little I don't
know what you call it display it's so
exciting so go check it out and see my
picture cuz I'm like overly excited but
now I'm taking the browsing from benefit
as well and I'm gonna use this to fill
in my brows and I love this my favorite
way to use it is to mix the powder and
the wax together so it's kind of like a
killed two birds with one stone kind of
thing you fill in your brows to also set
them in place as well and the wax just
makes it a little bit darker and
somebody wanted to say hey so sorry but
the wax just helps make it a little bit
darker and really quick and easy to do
your brows I love this it's been so easy
to work with and I just am obsessed with
it and then to set everything I'm gonna
take the Gimme brow by benefit and this
gimme brow is great when you fill in
your brows and when you don't fill them
in because when you don't have your
brows filled in this has little fibers
actually hold on to your eyebrow hairs
and make sure eyebrows look fuller
instantly so you don't have to fill in
your eyebrows to use that product you
can just apply it and be all good
go and it is amazing I've talked about
it for so long then I'm taking a black
cart again and I'm just going to put
this underneath my lower lash line right
there to these lower lashes and then
we're gonna take the nooner shade and
blend this out and I did use the Rimmel
nude eyeliner on my waterline just to
open up the eyes and make them look a
little bit brighter then I'm taking my
Skerritt and putting that on my lower
lashes now I'm taking this Lankan lip
liner and lining my lips and then Davis
decided that lovesick by Kat Von D was
the shade that I should shoot that I
shouldn't put on my lips so the
everlasting liquid lipstick and a love
stick is what I used and we ended up
thinking that it was like just too light
I wasn't I'm not a huge like light pink
person or I'm not really even like a
pink lips kind of fan but I wanted to
add a little bit of gloss so I took this
NARS gloss and put it on top and I
really liked the color combo that it
came out to be so that is the complete
look I really hope you guys enjoyed it
I'll leave all the products I used it
down below in the description box and

up and leave a comment down below what
