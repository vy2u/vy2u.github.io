you can tell by the beginning of this
footage so I'm here with tres mate by
the way thinking you trust me so much
for partnering with me for this video
and for inviting me to come out here
it's amazing so if you follow me on my
social media you know I've been out here
and yesterday I actually got to go to a
hair test and it was so awesome to see
because you get to see them doing the
hair kind of figuring things out what
they want to do for the show you get see
models and the clothes before the show
which is so cool and it was just such an
awesome experience and here today to
show you guys the hairstyle that they
did yesterday that they're going to have
on the models for the month so I think
it's hella same MO NSE and if they had
amazing outfits so I cannot wait for the
show but the hairstyle is really easy
and you can do it at home it's something
you can do for work something for a
night out even because it's kind of
freak but still kind of sexy at the same
time anyways I Mac was talking about it
I'm going to show you guys some of the
vlog footage anomie also demonstrating
how to do it so for my makeup I just did
a very natural look I did my base just
foundation concealer a little bit of
contour and I did add some light false
lashes so very very simple look for
today but it's kind of like my staple
look lately you know what I mean okay so
let's move onto the hairstyle that I
learned at the hair test so it's super
easy used to entire hair back in a
ponytail leave some fringe out in the
front if you have some and then you're
going to divide your ponytail into two
and twist it and then hairspray it and
then you're going to wrap it around like
a bun and bobby pin that into place and
then what you're going to do is you're
going to take the other section do the
same exact thing but twist it the
opposite way that you twisted the first
section and then you're going to bobby
pin that as well and that is literally
it you guys that's all you do you can
run your fingers through your Pony to
kind of loosen it up have some pieces
out and you are good to go I think the
bun is so cute it's different
and don't forget once you have
everything in place to take the hsm a
extra hold hairspray and spray it all
over just
to make sure you've locked everything
into place and then I did and I'm also
going to show you a really quick clip of
the hair stylist like finishing up with
the model hers is much more like
editorial but hey we did it right again
thank you so much trust me for parting
with me to make this video and I can't
wait to share the rest of my experience
with you guys definitely check out my
vlog channel if you haven't already I'll
be doing vlogs and stuff it's snowing
right now
pretty intense thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
