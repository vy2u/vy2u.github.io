a makeup tutorial on this look I told
you guys that my goal this year was
definitely to incorporate more drugstore
products and affordable products into my
channel so I'm trying to put them out
for you I just did another everyday
makeup look not too long ago so I'll
leave that down below it was a
completely drugstore this one is
including some drugstore and some more
affordable products and what I mean by
that is I actually got some makeup geek
eyeshadows which are pretty affordable
great quality oh my gosh for the price
obsessed I bought all these I'm finally
on that makeup trick makeup trick no I'm
finally on that makeup geek train and I
am NOT getting off of it so choo-choo I
used one of the new foil eyeshadows
today in grandstand so pretty so
everything in this video is affordable
or from the drugstore highly recommend
everything I used in this video because
oh my gosh I'm obsessed
I'm so happy with the way this look
turned out because I had no idea what I
was doing I was just like let's just
play around with some affordable
products this is a full-on look contour
blush highlight everything hits the blam
in the title but again like just like my
last drugstore tutorial you could
totally customize this to whatever you
want do I have to do everything don't
even have to do lashes you have
beautiful lashes rock your lashes I
really hope you guys enjoy this video
and enjoy the look as much as I do and
if you did enjoy this video please share
it with your friends Facebook whatever
it helps me out a lot so thank you guys
again so much for watching and let's get
started with the video okay so the first
color we're gonna take is creme brulee
it's a really amazing warm shade to just
put into the crease one of my all-time
favorite shades from makeup geek I've
actually had this specific shade for a
while like a few years I love it I think
it's the definite must-have and it's
super super pigmented just like the rest
of her eyeshadows and then I'm gonna
take this shade hipster it's kind of
like a topi satin shade it's not
completely matte but I like this one to
deepen up the crease a little bit
it just adds a little bit of a nice
shadow but it's not too bold and I think
it really helps compliment the eyes and
I like the shimmer in it too it just
adds something a little bit extra
normally I don't put shimmer in the
crease but today I was like why not it's
not really glittery or anything but it
definitely has a sheen to it then I'm
going to take the color latte and I'm
going to use this in the outer portion
of the crease just to deepen it up a
little bit more and make it a little bit
more warm as well you guys know I love
my warm looks I promise I have some cool
ones coming for you but I love me some
warm shadows it's not all I'm gonna do
is I'm just gonna take my brush and
blend out these shades just so we don't
have any harsh lines and then moving on
to the star of the show it is the foiled
eyeshadow in grandstand this is a
beautiful color oh my gosh having a nice
light shimmery shade like this all over
the lid it really helps make your eyes
look open and awake and it just really
live-ins up any eye color it just makes
everybody's eyes look beautiful so
grandstand is one of my favorites I
think it is stunning and the color
combination with the other shadows is
just on point I love it oh so pretty
these are very very pigmented as well I
didn't use fix 2 plus or anything like
that I just dipped my brush in it and
went straight to my lid though I'm going
to put this all over the entire lid and
then we're going to go back in and just
touch up the crease with a little bit of
the latte shade
now we're gonna take this Revlon a liner
I love this liner is so amazing you guys
it's a very very pigmented and easy to
work with what I'm doing is I'm just
lining the upper lash line and then I'm
gonna smudge it out so it's not as harsh
but you still have that definition on
your eyes I personally love having liner
on my top line just because I like to
define it feel like if I don't I feel
like it just looks a little sloppy and
my eye shape just looks weird so I
always just line it and then smoking it
out cause it really sexy but sultry look
but it's not harsh at all I really love
smoking out liner I think it looks
really beautiful I guess that's the only
portion that is not drugstore which is
the velour lashes but you can use
whatever you have on hand then I'm gonna
take my number seven mattifying primer
and the trick with this you guys is
definitely just to press it into your
skin because it dries so stinkin fast so
just take your time with it and really
press it into the skin don't really rub
it around everywhere and then I'm gonna
take this Revlon foundation I love this
foundation I think is absolutely
beautiful and paired with the matte
primer it's just amazing I love it I
wanted to use my NYX HD concealer but I
couldn't find it so I'm using it the
Maybelline master conceal I do like this
concealer but it sets really quickly so
make sure to blend it out one eye at a
time I like it like I said but it is a
little bit light for me and I don't know
I just I feel like I like the NYX HD one
better and I still want to try the la
pro conceal but this is a very nice
concealer I give it that has great
coverage and as long as you blend it out
right away it works perfectly
and I'm just gonna set the concealer
using this elf High Definition powder
this is a great powder but the packaging
absolutely sucks because it gets
everywhere but I really do love this
product
I used to use this when I first started
my channel and it's awesome lose they're
really nice smooth finish to the skin
then I'm going to take this BH Cosmetics
forever nude palette and this is a
must-have in my opinion I just love it
so I'm gonna take the middle shade and
that's the color I'm gonna bronze with
has more of a red undertone so I just
like to use this on the high points of
my face just to really warm up the skin
then moving on to the shade right next
to it which is more ashy I'm going to
use this to contour you're gonna see how
excited I get about this contour look at
it one two three boom so happy oh I love
this contour palette you guys it's just
beautiful the shades blend out very very
well and the colors are perfection so
again I'm just going to contour my face
under my jaw contour my nose under my
lip and then I'm taking the blush in the
palette as well and just putting this on
my cheeks which is again a really
gorgeous color it's just a rosy pink
shade and it just liven up this skin
which is perfect for everyday
then I'm gonna take my dua fiber and
just blend everything out and then a for
highlight I will be using a makeup geek
shadow and shimma shimma it's a very
shimmery eyeshadow but I absolutely love
it and it added a really gorgeous
highlight to the tops of my cheekbones
then it's time to fill in the brows I'm
using the NYX eyebrow gel and then
moving on we're gonna take this Rimmel
liner in nude and putting this on the
waterline this is another trick to
really help make your eyes look more
awake and open if you have smaller eyes
this will also help really make them
look bigger and I love this color
because it doesn't look fake and starch
like a white eyeliner could so I love it
Rimmel eyeliner and nude it's perfect
then I'm gonna take this mocha shade
from makeup geek and I'm putting this on
my lower lash line I'm taking it from
the inner corner to the outer corner and
I love smoking out my lower lash line
and just defining it more so that's what
we're gonna do here and this shade isn't
too deep so it's not gonna look super
super smoky it's just gonna add a nice
shadow underneath that lower lash line
and then we're gonna take a latte and
this is a shade we're gonna blend that
out with and you just want to go back
and forth to make sure there are no
harsh lines
and then moving on the lips I'm gonna
take this next lip liner in nude pink
and just align them and then I'm taking
this a Rimmel lipstick do a thing I
forget what it's called I think it's
like provocative sore something and I'm
gonna take the color side and put that
on my lips first I did do with two
layers of this just so it was nice and
opaque and then you just take the other
side of it and put that gloss on and it
just makes it nice and matte and I do
love this stuff it lasts all day and I
think it's a really pretty shade and
again perfect for everyday
so after that I also forgot to highlight
underneath my brow bone so I'm gonna do
that really quickly here and I believe I
use the shade vanilla bean from a cookie
as well it's just a nice matte vanilla
shade and then after that you are done
with this look so I really hope you guys
enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up if
