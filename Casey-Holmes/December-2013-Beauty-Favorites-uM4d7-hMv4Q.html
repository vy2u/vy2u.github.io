my December favorites and I did just do
my yearly favorites which I'll link that
down below in the description box but I
did want to show you guys products I've
been loving for December because if I
waited till January it would just be too
big and too long of a video so I figured
I'd go ahead and do my December
favorites and show you guys what I've
been loving I kind of forgot certain
things when I did my yearly favorites so
I'm gonna include them in this video
today so the first thing I want to show
you guys is a primer this is the NARS
Pro prime smudge proof eyeshadow base
this is a clear eyeshadow base but it is
so great if you have oily eyelids or if
you just have a hard time having
eyeshadow stay on your lids or not
crease this is the primer to go to funny
thing that stuck to this packaging does
have the same kind of you know NARS
packaging that they're known for so it
does get very dirty but the product on
the inside is amazing and then another
primer is this Too Faced shadow
insurance of glitter glue it's a glitter
bonding eyeshadow primer and this has
been my go-to for December and I think
it's gonna be my go-to all year round
because I even love using this with my
pigments more than the mac fix+
this really just it creates a nice
techie base on your lid to put like any
glitter on or if you want to put a
pigment on you can use this as a primer
for it it's good to go over any
eyeshadow it doesn't like smudge it all
over the place it just kind of lays on
top and if you want to see this in
action I'll leave my New Year's Eve
tutorial down below and you can see how
I used it in that video okay next I have
a highlighter this is a Becca
highlighter and the only thing I don't
like about this is the packaging I think
the packaging is just a little ugly the
product is really nice this isn't the
color moonstone and I do have it on
today I don't know if you can tell but
this is like a champagne gold kind of
highlight and I love highlights like
this I don't really like pink highlights
just because I don't personally think
they flattered me very well but these
are my favorite I just absolutely adore
this one it's just one that I picked up
on a whim on about November December and
I've
loving it ever since product I'm in
loving is this Bobby Brown blush and
tawny this is the first Bobby Brown
blush I've ever tried and I love it I
figured I would go with more of a
neutral color that could go with
anything and this is definitely a great
color goes with almost any look and I do
have it on today as well I can use it
all the time and if I had go to splurge
on blushes I like to go for the more
neutral shades not so much hot pink or
Reds or anything like that because you
know I want to use them as much but
colors like this I will use constantly
and this has just been one of my go-to
blushes it's smooth on the skin and just
I just think it looks so beautiful now
it will have this week a video on my but
forgot at products like my update for
January and I'm going to be showing you
what I'm using for February so just stay
tuned for that but I definitely want to
mention these two products because
they've been like this standout products
in my bonnet forgotten series so I have
been using this pretty much every single
time I've applied any makeup it is so
awesome I don't know why I never used it
as much which that's why I love the bond
I forgot it series is because you can go
back and use you know different things
that you kind of forgot about and this
is one of those products and now I know
I'm going to be going to it a lot this
palette got a ton of love in December
and I used it again today if you're
gonna buy a high-end palette this is
definitely the way to go because the
colors are insanely beautiful and I mean
there's so many looks you can create
with this and then also I had to mention
my Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I
have used this ever since I've been my
bought it forgot it and I can still see
the rings in it but it has not hit pan I
don't know if you will never hit pan or
what but literally I just I haven't been
able to get away from this I did not use
another bronzer in December this was my
go-to and I love it it's just it's
really great and it smells delicious
okay just a couple more makeup items I
have have to have to mention this says
say Lauder Double Wear foundation I do
have a Mac pump on the top of this
because the Mac pumps do fit this bottle
because it does not come with a pump so
I know it's hideous but I would much
rather have a pump on this then
have one because it got real messy there
for a minute but this is a gorgeous
foundation again I have it on today
I mix the shade 3w 1 and 4 W 1 I do
believe I had gotten a sample of it so
those are two colors I'm wearing today
and I just think it makes your skin look
amazing and I never touch up when I have
this on my skin like it is so good I
love the way it makes my skin look and
it's just a perfect foundation fast
makeup product is this Makeup Forever
aqua brow now I know this is looking a
little scary in the tube I was a little
scared too when I got in the mail but I
got this because I thought it'd be great
for filling in the outer part of my brow
just to make it a little more sharp out
here I like the way it looks when it
kind of fades into it so this has been
my go-to product for that it's super
easy to work with and if you use a light
hand with it it's not going to come out
super brown like this it will be a
little bit lighter can't wait to try
this in the summer months because it
says it's an aqua brow so it's
waterproof so we're gonna have to see if
that's really waterproof but this stuff
does last all day I will say that and
the color I got is the darkest color so
whichever color that is that's the one I
got now this month I have really really
really been into lashes and these have
by far my favorite I actually used up
this multi pack I'm wearing the demi
wispies today these are the last pair in
here but the ardell demi whispies have
been my go-to for any look a natural
look a dramatic look I just adore them
and I'm I can't believe I used up the
whole multi pack I even reused the
lashes and I just went through the whole
thing so I love these lashes but they're
really really pretty and then I also
started using I have quite a few of
these because when I buy them I stock up
these are the Gypsy lashes and 906 black
and I love these these are very wispy as
well and I actually used these on my
friend for New Year's and it looked so
gorgeous on her so I think these lashes
would pretty much go with anyone you can
use it for a dramatic look natural look
whatever I think these are beautiful and
then last but not least these are for
when I have a super dramatic eye makeup
look these are the red cherry for 15
I've been using these so much I really
do love them there
really long really dramatic but they go
along with the dramatic makeup looks a
couple tools I want to mention is this
Beauty Blender dupe that I got from
Marshalls I've had that video was such a
great response and I'm so happy that you
guys took it really well because I know
it's really hard to find a Beauty
Blender dupe and I feel like this is
legit DPP Blender Duke I know the longer
you were sending me pictures of the ones
with the shapes like the indention in
the middle and it's kind of bigger on
the sides I haven't tried those so I
can't necessarily tell you 100% if
that's a Beauty Blender dupe but they do
have these at Marshall's and I think
it's a complete dupe so if you think the
ones that are shaped kind of like an
hourglass are dupes for the Beauty
Blender then let us know in the comments
below because I haven't tried them yet I
might have to go pick it up and I will
be trying the Real Techniques one so
just stay tuned for that and really
quickly I have to mention the brush that
has literally changed my life of
contouring so NARS each a brush I took
whatever I'm gonna call EDA and I love
this brush seriously my contour has
never looked better ever like it is
stunning I when I first got it I kind of
did have a hard time figuring out how to
apply my bronzer with it but once I got
it down it's like I mean it's nothing
for me to hurry up and just do a contour
like I can do it with a super quick look
and it's just it looks so great with
this brush I'm so happy I got it another
product this is something I've used
throughout the in the last year kind of
like from I'd say August till the end of
last year and I never mentioned it just
because it's one of those things I put
in my jaw and I don't really pull out
all the time unless I'm washing my
brushes and it's eating my dry in shape
and I love this specifically for my
kabuki brushes because I don't have like
multiples of like the SAT or the f-86
those are my two favorite brushes from
Sigma and when I wash them more than
likely I'm gonna want to use them the
next day and sometimes like without the
drying shake they will not be dry the
next day I'd have to wait like two days
for them to be dry but I can put them in
this little guy and literally all you do
is you just take your brush and you put
it in the top and then the bristles like
gather in
this little thing and it literally
drives your brushes overnight which is
so great because sometimes I'll wait
till like 1:00 or 2:00 in the mornin to
wash my brushes because I'm just putting
it on the back burner and by a morning
time you know about noon or 1:00 o'clock
the brushes are dried and ready to go I
totally forget to mention it because I
just throw it in the drawer but you
gotta check this out okay so I have a
few more things I bet this video is very
long I'm sorry but first off a perfume
this is the Miss Dior Dior perfume and
I'm in love with this it is such a sexy
grown-up scent like I love it so pretty
it was very expensive but it lasts all
day on me I went and returned my product
handy because I like this smell but the
lasting power was just not there and if
I'm going to spend that kind of money on
a perfume it needs to last but this was
basically than the same price as the
Prada candy and it lasts so much longer
so if you're looking for a nice perfume
I would definitely recommend this one
and then I just have a few of skincare
favorites I want to shout out real
quickly
first thing is a new body butter that
I've tried and it's the Clinique deep
comfort body butter this stuff is
amazing I was having a hard time with
like my skin being super dry during
these winter months and this has brought
my skin back to life I saw this on so
Flora I did not think it was this big
it's six point seven ounces so you get
quite a bit of product for your money
and I'm only about halfway through it I
would say and I highly recommend it if
you just have super super dry skin next
is a mass it's the origins clear
improvement active charcoal mass to
clear pores and I've been loving this
I'll switch between this one and my
whisset glam glow mask the skin clearing
treatment one I just alternate between
the two each week I do a mask about two
times a week and I like this one a lot
because it makes my skin feel so smooth
that they still feel like my skin is
super super clean and I really enjoy
this stuff I mean I've just been using
it so much now I have quit using a
makeup remover wipes to take off my
makeup at night I'm now - a cleansing
oil I've noticed a huge difference in my
skin not
the makeup remover wipes which is
awesome that was one of the
recommendations that's that the
esthetician gave to me was to quit using
them on my face and stuff so I did and I
found a great cleanse off oil it's the
Bastia bosco who knows makeup breakup
coal cleansing oil this stuff is amazing
I told you guys I like to use the Matt
cleanse off oil but mainly for my eyes
because it does break out my face really
bad this one does not break out my face
it takes off all of my makeup and my
skin is seriously so clean from this I
take off all my makeup with this and
then I wash my face with my purity
cleanser and I'm good to go I haven't
even been using my Clarisonic much
anymore I mentioned it in that yearly
favourites and ever since I just haven't
been using it just because it was a
recommendation from the institution that
I you know go off of it for a while I I
mean my skin has been super clear using
this product in my purity cleanser and I
haven't had any issues my still my skin
looks just as great the texture is still
awesome and then the last skin care item
I want to mention is this Estee Lauder
advanced night repair I knew after using
this the first night that I was gonna
love this and it is so good I've used up
quite a bit of it
so I used this at night after I've
cleanse my face but before I put on
moisturizer and I just noticed it's made
my skin so smooth my redness is really
calmed down
I just noticed such a huge difference
using serums on my skin I started that
back about the end of last year as well
using the serums and I've definitely
invested in this because I've heard
great things and I've seen great results
from it my skin looks really nice and
healthy
it feels amazing I mean the whole
skincare routine I've got going on right
now is awesome and I'm not even using
the Clarisonic and I personally didn't
think I would have super clear skin
without the Clarisonic but I do I feel
like my skin looks just as great if not
better without the Clarisonic okay so
the last thing I want to mention to you
guys this is another product kind of
like the Sigma one that I used
throughout the year but forgot to
mention in a favorites video it's the
whitening lightening dials malakut now I
mainly use this before events like I
used it before beautycon I used it
before my Sigma meat
and before New Year's I really do love
this stuff I think it makes my teeth so
white my teeth are still super white now
and honestly I stick to the dial smile
kit I don't even use the pins that much
edge stuff does it for me and it lasts a
long time on me so I don't necessarily
think I have to use the pins all the
time I like to use before big events or
if I just do like my teeth are looking a
little yellow because I do love Diet
Coke um I will just go to this and it'll
make my teeth nice and bright and it's
like four to five shades brighter I
swear to you so I wanted to demonstrate
this for you guys but I'm gonna bring
Colton in to demonstrate it for you
because I just did mine since New Year's
was like the other day and I'm gonna
show you guys how to use it so one
second okay so while he's taking forever
I'm going to show you guys what you get
in the dial a smile kit I do keep mine
in here just because it's a quite a bit
of stuff so I just keep it in here and
put it underneath my back room sink so
first thing is you get the little light
I keep it in here just for sanitary
reasons and then you get the q-tip with
the stuff in it that you put on your
gums and your lips just to make sure
that you know if you did get the gel on
it it's not gonna make it super
sensitive or hurt or anything I have
pretty sensitive teeth but I haven't
noticed any issues with this product
I've even used it twice in one week you
also get the thing that drives off your
teeth you get the gel I took this out of
my refrigerator because you do want to
keep it in the fridge and it just comes
in like a little syringe thing and then
you get the wheel which you see what
color your teeth are well my teeth are
like a three or come in here what color
do they are right there so my teeth are
like a 4 to 5 and I just did mine on New
Year's okay so the first step is to dry
off them teeth so take that and drop
your teeth and make sure they stay dry
and then what you're gonna do when you
take the q-tip out you see the red end
you're gonna pop that off this is just
how I do it might be the wrong order but
how I do it then the stuff goes down to
the cotton ball or swab whatever you
call it
that's okay I don't get all dirty let me
mess your teeth real quick
you're there about 11 12 so remember
that okay and don't get your commute
your feet wet again yeah put it all over
your gums and your inside of your lip
and it also comes with a little brush to
apply the gel with okay keep your mouth
open okay next what you're gonna do is
just take the gel and put this oops I
put that in there we'll use up and you
just want to paint this all over your
teeth it's it's really easy you don't
have to get like super precise just make
sure you cover the whole entire tooth so
separate your teeth a little bit huh
like uh yeah
nice eye all right oh yeah and
you also do drool a lot with this but
it's totally natural so don't be upset
now you do and just take your little
mouthpiece and this part with the
indention is the top part plenty don't
let it touch your teeth just have it in
front
yeah like that and then all you do is
sit here for 20 minutes and then you're
done and you go rinse it all out and we
see how I think it okay so it's been 20
minutes and we're going to see what he
is now he was an eleven twelve yes
definitely taking down a lot of the
yellow see you were here you know you're
about a six and a seven what's that
so I went down one two three four four
to five shades like I said I figured I
would show you guys on him because I had
just did mine my teeth are still really
white but like if you have like a little
bit of yellow not necessarily on the
whole tooth but like a little bit near
the gums this will help make your teeth
look a lot whiter there so that's it for
this video I hope you guys enjoyed it
please give it a thumbs up if you did
and I will see you guys in my next video
