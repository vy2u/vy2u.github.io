a tutorial on this look and I've had so
many requests for this picture right
here I actually got this one off of
Instagram that someone tagged me in so
thank you so much for tagging me I want
to quickly say too that we do have
different eye shapes her are more deep
set and mine are not her eyes are so
it's gonna look a little bit different
of course everybody does not have the
same eyeballs so it's gonna look a
little different but I tried my best to
kind of recreate it for you guys so you
can see how it looks on my eyes this is
like the perfect look for fall winter
time is just classic and you can always
go back to it no matter what year I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
please give it a thumbs up if you did
like it and don't forget to subscribe to
my channel so you don't miss out on any
of my videos I will see you guys in my
next one bye
okay first off I'm gonna go ahead and
apply my tape you guys know I love to do
this so I can get nice sharp lines and
then going in with the it's due to time
pallet I'm gonna take this shade right
here it's a really nice warm transition
shade so I'm gonna put this right into
the crease and just build that color up
you could tell in the picture that she
had a very warm transition shade so
that's why I'm applying this one going
back to the og the original Naked
palette I'm gonna go ahead and take half
baked and put this all over my lid last
time I remember this is a lot more
pigmented but I definitely had to Palace
color on so I'm just gonna apply that
all over the lid and then I'm gonna go
in with this lorac Pro palette the first
one and take this gold shade because I
felt like that one was a little too
bright for me so I'm going to kind of
tone it down with this gold in the lorac
Pro because it's more of like an antique
to shade and it doesn't tone it down too
much but it's just enough so I'm going
to take stable and start applying this
in that outer corner but then I went
back with expresso and sable with a
pencil brush and I just ended up
deepening it up this way the pencil
brush just gave me more control and you
can tell in the picture that she does
get this color all the way in the crease
and right there in the inner corner so
I'm just going to take any excess that I
have on the brush and just drag it in
I'm not gonna focus too much on putting
a lot of color in the crease it's just
kind of faded in there most of the color
is on the outer half so just I just
focus on darkening up the outer half and
then dragging whatever excess you have
into the crease
then I'm taking this Alexa Prisco I
think it is cosmetic and I forget the
name of this but I'll have it down below
and you can't really tell on camera but
this added like a nice highlight right
to the center of the lid which is what
it looked like the girl had in the
picture it's nothing too crazy but it
just adds that bit of light right there
and gives it a little bit more life
after taking off the tape I'm gonna take
my Maybelline gel eyeliner and I'm going
to line my eyes her liner was really
thin from the inner corner to about
halfway and then she winged it out and
the winged liner was pretty straight so
I made mine as straight as possible that
looking goofy because my eyes are more
downturned so I can't do it super
straight
then I'm gonna take my NARS eyeliner and
eyeline to my upper waterline and then
for lashes I used a velour guru crazy
which I have a coupon for them down
below and then I'm applying primer and
my foundation which I have just been
falling in love with Estee Lauder Double
Wear again you guys it's just so
beautiful oh I love it
I'm back to it y'all I can't so I'm just
gonna apply this with my Sigma f80 I'm
gonna do a serious brush cleaning
paronto and then I'm taking my Mac Pro
Longwear concealer 's and just doing the
normal highlighting and concealing
underneath the eyes and in the center of
the face then I'm taking the Anasazi a
contour kit and taking this shade right
here and I'm going to be setting a my
concealer with that
so I'm taking the mac mineralize
skinfinish and give me Sun and I'm just
going to be putting this on the top of
my forehead my cheeks and then around my
neck and then I'm going to lightly
contour with my benefit hoola bronzer
I'm not doing anything too crazy but I
do want to shape the face you could tell
she definitely had some contouring going
on in the photo for blush I'm taking
NARS madly I feel like this complements
this look absolutely amazingly like look
at it it just gives a nice kind of glow
love this blush and then I'm gonna go
ahead and contour my nose
going to fill in my brows with this
fluid line from Mac and then I'm going
to highlight underneath the brow with
these two shades it was white and cream
from the first lorac palette and the
highlighting will really help bring it
this look together and then for the
waterline she did have a nude color on
her waterline so I'm taking this one
from Rimmel and lining at that water
line and this nude liner by Rimmel is
freaking amazing I love it and then I'm
gonna go in with half-baked again and
just drag this underneath the lower lash
line
and just put some color down there she
didn't really have much on her lower
lash line but I did see some gold so
that's just what I'm doing here then I'm
putting on some mascara on my bottom
lashes I'm using Clinique bottom lash I
love this one because it gets right to
the root so it helps cover up any of the
nude shade that might have gotten on the
lashes then the highlight I'm using
Bobbi Brown's highlighter in beige and
it is stunning I love this one so pretty
and then for lips I'm taking deep breath
from NYX and I'm lining them I thought
this was a lot deeper but yeah it wasn't
and then I'm gonna take Mac's diva and
apply that and then to really deepen up
this look like the girl had in the photo
we're gonna take this Gerard cosmetics
lip gloss I forget the name but it's
kind of like a purpley red color it's
very gorgeous the lip was definitely a
lot deeper than its coming off on camera
but this whole color combo really suited
the look so well and this lipgloss is
bomb so I'll leave it down below with a
coupon if you're interested so that's it
for this makeup look guys I really hope
you enjoyed it thank you so much for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
