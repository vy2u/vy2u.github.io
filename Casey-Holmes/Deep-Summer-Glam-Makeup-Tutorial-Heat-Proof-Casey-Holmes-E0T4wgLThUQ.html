on this pickup look right here I'm so
excited to share it with you because
these are like my favorite looks to do
like a really dark lip and smokey eyes
just like uh-huh you know just dramatic
and sexy and smoky and it's just all so
pretty so I'm so excited to bring you
this tutorial and this is actually a
really good long-lasting makeup look I
used a lot of products that will help
keep you matte if your oily if you want
this to last all night if you're going
out looking sexy even in the day girl if
you're going to brunch you're gonna look
good all day with this makeup look with
the products I'm showing you guys and
Clinique actually reached out to me to
try their stay matte foundation which I
have tried before and I really like it
so I'm going to be featuring at this
foundation in the video I really like it
looks like skin but it still keeps you
really nice and matte so if you're oily
and you get sweaty if you feel like your
makeup just melt off your face this will
help you and then I did use it with the
stay matte powder using these two
together will give you that bulletproof
makeup look that you want that's gonna
last all day long and I do have a really
serious breakout but you can't see right
now and I'm so happy I love makeup
makeup just covers everything and makes
everything look so glam keep in mind you
can wear this in the summertime or the
fall I would rock this in the summertime
I really don't care I don't have a
preference on when I rock super dark
makeup looks you can definitely
transition this over to that season as
well it's just good year-round you know
what I mean I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you want to see how I got this
makeup look and all the products used
then let's just go ahead and get started
okay so we're going to go ahead and
start off priming our face and I'm going
to use my Smashbox primer water and my
cane and Austin mattifying primer to go
ahead and get my face ready for
foundation so today I'm going to be
using the clinic stay matte foundation
and this is a great foundation if you
have oily skin mine is a little bit too
light because when I got color matched
it was right before I went to the lake
but we're gonna make it work
so I'm just blending it in with a Beauty
Blender and this formula does absorb the
shine it controlled your oil and resist
sweat which makes it great to wear all
day long and to give you a little
rundown on this foundation there are 20
shades and it's oil free and I also
tested this foundation and really high
heat and humidity to make sure that it
stays put all day and keeps you matte
this is a medium to full coverage
foundation as you can see it covered all
of my redness and it
like that in this foundation with the
matching powder is a really great combo
because it does hold up all day long in
the heat and it is hot in Georgia so if
they can stay nice and matte throughout
this southern heat that's how you know
it's good and then I'm going to take it
this Tarte concealer and put it
underneath my eyes and down the center
of my face to highlight these areas and
really make them pop then I'm going to
go in with this airspun powder and I'm
going to put this underneath my eyes and
down the center of my face
the same place is where we put concealer
just to bake everything while we do our
eyes now I'm going to take this NARS
primer and I highly recommend it if you
want your eyeshadows to stay all day and
then we're using the anastacio modern
renaissance palette which is a gorgeous
I just got this in the mail you guys and
I'm so obsessed with it already like I
can't so
the first shade I'm going to take is
tempera and I'm going to put this all
over my lid just to even out and create
a nice creamy base for the rest of the
shadows that we're going to put on then
I'm going in with raw Sienna and I'm
just going to put this into my crease
with a blending brush I am building this
color up just a little bit so it's a
little bit more intense but I'm going to
flip it up towards the brow bone just a
little bit as well so it fades nicely
towards the brow
next up I'm taking the color regu real
car home is that regular take it the
color wheel gar whatever that means I'm
going to be putting this right below
that crease shade that we had I'm still
going into the crease just a little bit
below the brown and I'm also putting
this in the RV as well I'm going to do
this on both sides and then I'm going to
blend out the edges with raw Sienna once
again which is the first color that we
put on
then we're going to be taking one of my
favorite shades in the palette which is
love letter and I'm going to put this
all over my lid Lily that inner corner
of my eye nice and bare so we could put
a different color there and I don't know
why I use a small brush for this but I
realized I was you know acting up so I
just had to get a bigger brush and it
worked a lot better this color did kind
of get a little patchy on me I don't
know why I did have to build it up but
once you build it up it is a really
pretty color
then I'm going back in with that realgar
shade and I'm going to blend out the
edges of this as well just blend along
the way and you'll be good to go good to
go I say good to go all the time I can't
help it I'm sorry
then I'm going to take a shade primavera
I think that's how you say it and I'm
going to put this in the inner core of
my eyes to make this look pop you could
drag all these darker colors all the way
to the inner corner if you want extra
smoky but I do want a pop of highlight
so this is why I decided to do I think
this color is even better when you spray
your brush with six plus it makes it
much more vibrant and intense so that's
what I decided to do and I really ended
up loving it and then you just want to
kind of fade it into the color of love
letter and then take a blending brush
and smooth out the edges just so you
have a nice faded effect and then after
that I'm going to go ahead and disarray
the baking and then we're going to go
ahead and put on the Clinique stay matte
powder which is great like I said with
this foundation it really is a
bulletproof combo keeps you nice and
matte so I'm going to take that powder
and put it all over the rest of my face
just so everything is nice and locked
down and when we put product on top it's
not going to look patchy or anything
like that so I really like this pattern
because it's nice and sheer so it's not
going to look cakey on top of your
foundation then we're going to pop on
some liquid liner I did do a winged
eyeliner and then I also used my Balu
lashes and fluff and wispy which are
amazing moving on to the face I'm again
going to take the NYC bronzing powder
and sunny and I'm going to bronze my
face with this actually is this in a
dupes video and I've been really
enjoying it so I decided to go ahead and
bronze my face with it again today then
to contour we're going to use the Tarte
TARDIS contour palette and I'm going to
use the soot shade three and four and
I'm going to put this right on my
contour line I couldn't find my contour
brush so this target brush had to do and
I actually really liked it so I went
ahead and carved out my cheekbones and
then blended it out as usual
and don't mind my forehead it's peeling
then I'm taking the blush in the palette
I'm just going to pop this on my cheeks
I like this color because it has a hint
of rosy pink but it's not too intense
and it doesn't overpower this look so I
really like it and I am going to go
ahead and blend that out as well and
then I'm also going to apply highlighter
and then we're going to move on to brows
for brows I'm going to use the benefit
Cobra and number three my brows were
giving me so much saltiness today like I
couldn't even deal with this so I didn't
film too much of it just because they
were driving me insane but I do love the
benefit cut brow product and it always
uses Tarte I rob rush it's one of my
favorites I've just been using it for so
long now I can't get away from it and
then I am going to set it in place with
this honest Asya brow gel in a brunette
as well which is really the icing on top
of the cake when it comes to brows I
like it a lot
then I'm going to use the shade for Mir
which is kind of like a lighter pinky
tone shimmery shade and I'm just going
to put this underneath my brows to
highlight and then I'm also going to go
ahead and put on the NYX wonder pencil
on my waterline which is a really nice
nude eyeliner I like this a lot it's not
too intense like a white eyeliner would
be but this does make your eyes look a
little bit bigger and it looks a little
bit more natural and I'm saying natural
very very lightly here then I'm going to
take the shape love-letter with this
flat definer brush I'm going to press
this right up against that lower lash
line I am smoking this out but I'm not
dragging it down as far as I normally do
I kind of want to keep it right up there
with the lower lash line but still blend
it out so it doesn't have a harsh line
and I'm also going to drag it out right
beneath the tear duct area you'll see
right here this is like a better angle
you can see I'm kind of leaving the tear
duct angle a little bit more highlighted
and I'm just dragging the line out right
underneath it this also makes your eyes
look a little bit bigger as well and I
love the way that it turned out so then
I'm going to take that Vermeer color
again and just highlight that inner
corner to really make it pop and then
we're going to go over one more time
with love-letter on that lower lash line
and really intensify it and make sure it
pops underneath that lower lash line
everything is freaking popping in this
makeup tutorial now go ahead and apply
my Skara on my lower lashes and then
we're going to line our lips with this
Palladio Cabrera I forget what it's
called I'll leave it down below and then
I'm going to use two smashbox always on
liquid lipsticks the first one I'm using
is True Grit True Grit is more of a
really nice deep dark brown don't get me
wrong I absolutely
love it on its own but I did want to top
it with more of a purple tone which the
one I'm using today is girl gang and I
feel like it kind of just goes with the
look a little bit more and I love the
purple tones in this look so I just
wanted to top this on over that and I
love the way it turned out it looks so
pretty and I just love these liquid
lipsticks as well they feel so
comfortable on the lips and they dry
really quickly so I highly recommend
them I'm itchin them a few times before
and I just can't stay away from these
liquid lipsticks
and then if you need to just clean up
your lips and then you are officially
done with this makeup look so I hope you
