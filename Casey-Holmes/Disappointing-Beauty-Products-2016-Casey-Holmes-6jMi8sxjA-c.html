back a notch and talk about some
disappointing products now I always talk
about products I love and things like
that and sometimes I will mention to you
when something doesn't work for me and
lately I've come across a few things
that just don't work for me and I want
to share them with you there's some high
end there's some drugstore I don't have
a ton but these are just products that
are at the top of my head I just don't
like that didn't work for me now quickly
I want to say just because I don't like
something a company came out with it
doesn't mean I don't like the entire
company I like a lot of these brands but
this just didn't work for me and I want
you guys to keep in mind I have oily
skin very oily I have rosacea and I have
height and expectations I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you do
like these kinds of videos give it a
thumbs up I haven't done it in years and
I'm talking years like probably three
years because sometimes when you make
these videos people get really upset in
the comments but just now everybody has
different skin types expectations and
once and just needs with their makeup
and skincare so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and if you want to see the
things that we're disappointing to me so
far this year then let's just get
started okay so the first one is one
that I know a ton of people love and a
ton of people swear by people that are
world renowned makeup artists and things
like that they love this foundation but
for my oily skin it has never worked for
me so does they make up forever HD
foundation this looks great on so many
different skin tones and skin types they
have so many different colors but I
think this is more for combo to a normal
to dry skin it really sucks - guys I've
seen so many people wear this and their
skin looks absolutely amazing but when I
wear it I immediately look oily and
gross and then throughout the day it
does not stay on my skin at all even if
I said it it just looks really bad on my
skin so this was the first product
everyone to mention because it just
didn't work for me but let me know if
you have oily skin if you've tried the
new stick one I've also heard some
people say that that one kind of slides
around as well if you have oily skin so
let me know in the comments if you are
oily if you used it if you loved it or
what but for my oily skin it was like
hey not today okay the next one is
another foundation and I mainly didn't
like this foundation because of the
problem areas that I have I do have
rosacea if you don't know and this is a
buxom show some skin weightless
foundation I've heard some really great
things about this and I want to try it
out oh I have a lot of redness this
didn't cover anything at all I know it's
a weightless foundation to light to
medium coverage I totally get it but to
me stuff like this makes my rosacea look
worse it's like you try to cover it up
but it's still showing through and it
just looks really really uneven and
messy again I'm just really picky about
foundations and I do like some medium
coverage foundations like the one I'm
wearing right now is the L'Oreal Lumi
cushion and I really really like it even
with a concealer on top I think it looks
great
but oh this one just did not look good
on top of my rosacea and I just
ooh I do love buxom but this is just one
that I'm gonna have to pass on so always
nervous about putting out videos like
this because even companies like don't
like it like they get mad it's just like
I'm sorry bro I didn't like a product
can't like everything the next thing is
one that I have tried so many times to
like and I just despise this product
because every time I put on my face it
ruins my makeup and I've seen a lot of
people love this one as well like a lot
of these things people love and I'm like
I don't like it it just didn't work so
it is Xia cosmetics bye bye pores
poreless finish HD micro powder so like
I said I do have run this underneath my
foundation everything my rosacea and
okay oh I tried this like a year or so
ago and I just brushed it on with my
powder brush and I noticed it rubbed
away my foundation especially around my
cheek area because my rosacea which is
coming through my foundation covered it
but then when I tried to put powder on
it like rubbed it all away so I was like
okay alright maybe I did that wrong so I
went to Pat it on my skin and it did
this
bang about a year ago and I was like oh
whatever I'm not I'm not even gonna try
this again so it cosmetics actually sent
me a PR package and they sent me this
again and this is the newest one and I
was like alright maybe they've
reformulated it maybe it's not going to
ruin my foundation whatever I put it on
I decided to bake with this so I was
like maybe if I bake and it really sets
everything it won't move nothing I baked
underneath my eyes and I went to dusted
away very lightly might I add with a duo
fiber brush and my foundation again just
came off around cheeks and you could
completely see my redness and I was like
I'm done I'm never trying this product
again tried it three times and I just I
cannot get it to work for me completely
takes off my foundation right in here
and you just see rosacea like in your
face and it's not cute and I'm like well
I guess I'm going out looking like crazy
today because I found what time fix it
so very very disappointed in this
product that it didn't work for me
because it does have like a really great
finish on certain people that I've seen
like it's very poreless but I don't even
know I don't get very far with this I
don't even know if it keeps you matte
throughout the day I have absolutely no
idea I can't get past the fact that it
rubs my foundation off so this product
was definitely a no-go for me that's
like what I'm really passionate about
because I've tried it three times three
times okay so that was some high end
stuff I do have one more high end
product to share with you but I want to
share some drugstore makeup products
first so the first two are highlighters
from the drugstore this one is the
Physicians Formula one I don't know what
it's called because it ripped off with
the packaging but I remember seeing this
everywhere for a while like last year
and I was like shut up I need to try
that it looks amazing this doesn't show
up on my skin at all it doesn't give me
a really pretty glow nothing it does not
show up whatsoever on me so this was
just all in all didn't work on my skin
tone maybe if you have lighter skin tone
you would really like this or maybe I
just got a dud because some people that
have seen uses it's like whoa that
highlighted
it was good on me it's like where's the
highlighter no money I don't know
then this one was so disappointing I had
really high hopes for this one it's the
Sonia Kashuk Sahara sunset highlighter
and it came in a package like this I
don't know if it was limited edition or
what but y'all they had it open like
this in the package and you could see
all the colors and I was like yes found
a new drugstore highlighter that was
gonna be amazing i swatched it and I was
like yes this is everything I'm so
excited I put it on my face and I got
nothing
I got absolutely nothing out of it I've
tried the different look look at how
gorgeous that looks when you swatch it
like it looks so pretty but once you put
on your face and like dust away and you
don't see your highlight at all I mean
it didn't even really last it all on my
skin a little bit that you could see I
just dust it all throughout the day and
as I was applying it and I was like this
such a bummer I'm so sad about it so
this is another one I just wasn't a fan
of maybe they don't even have it anymore
maybe it was like limited edition thing
but it didn't work for me and I'm really
sad because this is like my fav color
right here it just didn't work
one more drugstore makeup product is one
that I found out about yesterday was in
one of my recent drugstore hauls and it
is the covergirl trublend nudes palette
now I do like this for really simple
look something very quick um not to not
when I'm being like super particular my
eyeshadow like it happened today today I
really worked on my eyeshadow and
everything like that I tried to use this
for a bomb tans a makeup look and I
could not get this to work for me the
darker shades I do really like and the
shade more like the matte shades I like
the most let these shimmer shades just
dust away on me I was packing on color
just packing and packing and packing
keep in mind this is with a primer
everything I was packing on the color
and I just was going up and it was
really depressing because this shade
right here just gives me life I like
when I swatch it it's everything it's
like a topi shimmery shade it's
beautiful
it's beautiful but it didn't work at all
for me as I kept piling it on my face
but the newer covergirl stuff that's out
is really nice and again the darker
shades in here are great but may in
these lighter shades I was just I was
relying on them before my Valentine's
Day makeup look so I could create
something like this with drugstore
products but they just like dust it away
okay this one's gonna be like one for
people that are probably gonna help me
in the comments because let's be real
I love glam glow I adore glam well I use
quite a few things from them and I just
I love the brand but this did not work
for me first off it did work as in
skincare wise
I felt like my skin felt really good
after this it felt really tight
but if you are sensitive to smells like
I am when it comes to skin care or
whatever if you're very sensitive to
smells you will probably not like this
this reminds me of something when I was
younger and like I think I threw up
gummy bears or something and this is
what that smells like some people said
smell like smell their pina coladas and
I agreed decimally pina coladas this
smells like a fake smell of pink claws
you know what I mean like you could tell
it's not the right smell but I was on
snapchat when I tried this out on and a
lot of you saw my reaction and it was
such a cool mask I mean the the kind of
like silver Tin Man thing was really
cool and it felt really great when I was
peeling it off and afterwards when I
moisturize and everything my skin felt
great but I could not get past the
smells this was really disappointing for
me I know a lot of people do love this
mask because it is really great if you
like the smell I think you'll like it
it's just very intense is a very intense
smell and with it being right underneath
my nose I felt really really nauseous
that's how sensitive I can be with
smells I'm very very picky about skin
care products and I'm just so sad this
didn't work for me if it had like if it
had this smell but less like
in-your-face
less intense I would probably like it
but the moment I open this I was like oh
my god I'm gonna hate it and then my
last disappointing product is what I'm
wearing right now and if you're
wondering why my damn neck is so tan and
so bronzed it's because of this guy now
this isn't disappointing because it
didn't deliver color this delivered
hella color like Linda's color I'm not
this color at all this is not me I had
to use one of the darkest foundations
that I have which is the C 5.5 from
L'Oreal Lumi you see this in person you
know this is dark and I had to use that
today and hopefully my tutorial turned
out okay this is the L'Oreal new sublime
a summer express wash off buddy buddy
body makeup lotion and medium it's a
summer glow and instant all-day
hydration I expected this to be like a
lotion with a hint of like glow enos and
it like maybe even a little bit of
glitter maybe a hint of color nothing
really intense
no that is not this product this product
is body makeup it's like the Sally
Hansen stuff which is what I did not
expect it to be this is just like the
Sally Hansen uh what is it airbrush leg
stuff oh I just wanted this to give me a
glow I didn't want like a self-tan I'm
already self tan which is why this is
looking a little crazy but it is a
really intentional it f it I'm just
going to show you guys right now how
darkness is so you see it right there
watch this I mean it is dark y'all it is
so dark that I was scared to death and I
put this on my chest and neck I was like
oh my god I have to film this is going
to be tragic when I first put it on I
was like oh final like buff out no it is
not buff out it is basically this color
I wonder what the lighter shade looks
like if it's a little bit better but oh
my gosh look at that oh it's supposed to
be water-resistant sweat resistant and
transfer resistant and transfer is
incorrect because I'm wearing a white
shirt right now
supposed to be transfer resistant but as
you can see it is not transfer resistant
it is all over my white shirt and I
waited quite a while before I put this
shirt on so so the main reason why this
is disappointing was because like I was
going straight from putting this on to
fill me
I was going to give me so much color I
would have like just put on regular
lotion
I would definitely only recommend this
if you wanted a like instant self tan
not if you want a glow because they
treat me with this glow stuff instance
summer glow that stays put all day
streak free which I don't agree with as
well I don't agree with the straight
free part if you're applying it with
your fingers I don't think it's straight
free I think it is a little bit streaky
that's why I wore this because up here
like you can see my finger marks and
stuff and I'm applying self-tanner for
years so I would recommend like a myth
to apply this with if you want a
completely streak free and it says
all-day hydration for flawless smooth
feeling skin my skin does feel really
smooth I will say that so those are all
my disappointing products so far in 2016
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope you found it someone helpful if
you're not mad at me because I don't
like these products thank you so much
for watching and I will see you all in
my next one bye hey Thor finally done
