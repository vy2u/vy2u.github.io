a makeup tutorial on that this look
right here I am using the lorac Pro mega
2 palette which I mentioned in my last
video in my September favorites yes and
I really love this palette I've been
using it a ton but I'm really obsessed
with this green and the palette it's
just a really gorgeous forest green and
I wanted to do a video and show you guys
how I would wear that green in the
palette so that's what we're using today
and if you guys can tell I am really
sick I've been sick for a while now but
the last couple days have just been like
miserable so yeah a lot of you been
asking for makeup tutorials though I
wanted to come back with a makeup
tutorial first and I also filmed a
boyfriend tag with my boyfriend over the
weekend when I went there to see him so
that will be the next video you see then
after that would be another makeup
tutorial so feel free to civvy pictures
on twitter or tag me on instagram
whatever and I will be sure to drop them
all down and do them for you guys I'm
feeling more inspired now and I just
really love this makeup look and I love
it from fall so I hope you guys enjoy it
and don't forget to give it a thumbs up
if you liked it and don't forget to
subscribe and if you want to see you how
to get this makeup look then let's just
go ahead and get started okay so I've
already got my primers on and these are
the ones that I used today I will leave
them down below in the description box
and like I said I'm using the lorac Pro
mega 2 palette and the first color I'm
gonna take is the color burlap and if
there's anybody else show you something
different about this makeup tutorial I'm
gonna give you like five seconds I'm not
using tape isn't that crazy I always use
tape on the corners of my eyes just to
create a sharp line but I couldn't find
my tape so I'm gonna show you a
different way they like to clean up my
eyeshadow but I'm taking a burlap and
I'm just putting this into the crease
and fluffing it out then I'm taking a
saddle with a smaller blending brush
like this and I'm going to put this
directly into the crease and I'm going a
little bit above the crease as well and
this is just going to really define that
area and make my eyes look a little bit
bigger
after that I'm going to take the shape
burlap again with the same brush and I'm
gonna go back over the saddle that we
just put on and blend it out even more
okay so now I'm taking the forest green
color in this palette and I'm going to
apply this all over the lid and also
drag it up towards the crease and a
little bit above the crease as well
and I'm gonna go in with the same fluffy
brush we used earlier but I'm gonna use
the forest
color again and I'm just going to put
this into the crease and blend out the
edges of this eyeshadows so we don't
have any harsh lines okay next I'm gonna
take burlap again and I'm just going to
put this directly above where that green
is and this is just going to make sure
everything blends nicely to the brow
bone and it also adds a lot of warmth to
this look so I just want to add a little
bit more of this because this burlap
shade is one of my favorites
okay next I'm taking this makeup forever
ink liner and I'm just gonna do a thin
line on the upper lash line I'm not
doing a wing or anything like that and
then I'm taking a makeup wipe like this
and I'm going to clean up the edges and
I'm gonna follow the lower lash line and
do an angle up towards my brow just so
there's a nice sharpen line and it
doesn't look too messy on the outer half
I'm using these Koko lashes and goddess
and then we're gonna move on to priming
our face this is the Smashbox primer
water and I love this I just got a new
bottle cuz I finished up my other one I
love it so much and I'm gonna take the
pore minimizing primer as well from
Smashbox and put this on my skin I've
been using this duo a lot you know for
the past few months and as well as this
foundation and they're just what works
for my skin and I really love them and
I'm using the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation obsessed with it like I said
I've been using it a ton and I'm using
the makeup geek brush I forget the exact
name of this but I'll have it in the
description box below and I'm gonna use
this to blend out the foundation on my
face and then I'm gonna take the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer and put that on the
center of my face and under my eyes and
then again blend it out with the same a
brush
now I'm gonna take this naked skin
concealer and put this on my nose I just
like this concealer for my nose and
applications really easy now I'm using
the Marc Jacobs Mirage filter palette
and I'm gonna take the yellow in here as
you can see I've already hit pan on it I
love the stuff and I'm gonna set all my
concealers so under my eyes and in the
center of my face
now I'm gonna take this hourglass
ambient lighting powder and since this
is a bronzer if I can talk and using
those smart Jacobs brush which is huge
but I love it and my brushes need a deep
cleaning so this is what I've been using
lately and I'm just gonna put this on
the top of my forehead with cheeks and a
little bit underneath with my chin and
then I'm taking the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer this is the medium shade
and I'm gonna use this to contour my
cheeks and am using the NARS eat a brush
to apply this
now taking this NARS a Lovejoy blush I'm
obsessed with this blush so pretty it's
such a gorgeous warm rosy shade I just
love this color and I'm gonna apply it
to my cheeks and then blend it out with
a regular face brush
now I'm going to take estee lauder heat
wave and I'm going to apply this to the
tops of my cheekbones just to a
highlight face I love this highlighter I
know it's just continued but honestly I
will never stop using it and then I'm
going to fill in my brows and I use
Anasazi dip brow and then taking
porcelain in the palette I'm going to
use this shade to highlight right
underneath the brow as well and then
taking max coats to riche it's a
gorgeous brown eyeliner this really
makes brown eyes pop I'm obsessed with
it you need it in your life if you have
brown eyes because it is beautiful and
then I'll take it for us with a flat
brush like this and I'm going to apply
it directly underneath in my lower
lashes and really pressure and really
pressing it up against that lower lash
line
then I'm taking burlap again and I'm
using a pencil brush and I'm going to
blend this out and this will just smoke
it out a little bit and make it nice and
warm underneath that lower lash line now
using the benefit roller lash I'm gonna
apply mascara on my lower lashes and
then it moving on the lips I'm like
cannot talk moving a hunt to lips I'm
gonna take this lip liner from Smashbox
I'll leave the name down below and this
MAC lipstick and taupe which is one of
my favorite and warm nudes it is just
gorgeous and I love it with this look
and then you are done with the makeup
look so I hope you guys enjoyed it thank
