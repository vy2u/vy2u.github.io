with you a Ulta and drugstore haul
I was planning on doing just an Ulta
haul but I went to CVS and Walmart today
and found a few things that I was like
so excited about and wanted to try and
wanted to also share with you guys so
that is what I'm gonna do today
and I really quickly want to say I did
film this look if you're interested let
me know if you want to see it down below
in the comments but I did film it it's
dramatic you know me I love being
dramatic let me know if you guys can see
it in the comments and don't forget if
you like this video then please give it
a thumbs up and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel I put up new
videos every Tuesday and Thursday and
Sundays and yeah I think that's pretty
much it and I'm also doing vlogmas if
you like to watch vlogs I will link my
channel down below where you can check
it out we're gonna go ahead and quit
blabbering and get started with this
haul okay first place we're going to
talk about is CVS I went to a CVS that I
used to go to all the time and I haven't
been there forever
but I went to CVS smells like um hold up
they replace the Milani section that
used to be there with an elf section and
that was like just so excited first
thing is I did repurchase this is the
elf brush it's a face kabuki brush and I
know I love this I know it's amazing I
just can't find my ones that I used to
have like from years ago I used to have
two of these bad boys but this is a
really great brush it's super soft and
I'm so excited to have it back in my
life so I did buy quite a bit of brushes
on this drugstore trick because I just
want to try some new drugstore brushes
out I haven't really given them a shot
in a while so that's what I did for you
guys so this is the MUA brand these were
a little bit more on the pricey side I
think there were like sixteen seventeen
dollars but the quality seems really
nice so this is just a duo fiber brush
you guys know I love doing fiber brushes
and the handle is like so long it's like
as long as my forearm guys it's huge and
then I'm also really excited about this
one this is the BB CC cream brush but
honestly you can use it for whatever you
want I'll probably use it for foundation
this one really intrigued me this is the
first one that I saw in the picture and
I was like I have to have that brush so
this is what it looks like it's just
much more dense it is a duo fiber and I
just feel like this will blend found a
really well and if not it'll just buff
bronzer really well all over your face
because it's like the perfect size they
also had Nicks at this CVS you know like
why didn't you guys upgrade when I used
to come here it's so depressing this is
a NYX butter lipsticks and I got it
mainly for this center shade right here
so you get the shades sandy which is a
really light pinky nude oh yeah very
light pink nude then you get this one
which is root beer float which I cannot
wait to try because it's so pretty it's
right up my alley I love it that's it
right there then you also get this one
which is afternoon heat which is a
beautiful red color and these NYX butter
lip sleep lipsticks are amazing so this
is like an orange red very very pretty
it's becoming more orange on camera but
it's definitely like a true orange red
on my hand and then they get some ardell
lashes I got two of the number which I
say get to it I use two of the two of
three double ups which just looked like
this I think I got the 207's I used to I
talked about them in a favorites video I
love them but I can't find them
currently but I wanted to try some
different ones out so two of the two or
three I love the double up line from our
dough and then it also did get a 2:04
double up as well which these are really
beautiful and then I got two lip liners
from Rimmel they were like buy one get
one 50% off one is in the shade epic
this is probably gonna be the one I use
all the time and they have like a
slanted tip to them oh my god I love
that color so that one is epic that is
epic shade I love that and then this one
is in obsession I'm that's an epic shade
I'm obsessed with it that is so funny on
anyway know the names of these this one
looks like max rebel if you were
wondering it looks just like it to me on
my hand it's coming off a little bit
more right on camera but it's definitely
a nice kind of plummy purple reddish
color and then I also picked up this
Ardell brow pomade and medium brown I
wanted to see if this is a dupe for the
Anasazi a dip brow I'm really trying to
find like dupes for higher-end products
so if you guys want to see a video like
that let me know
or just like this video but I wanted to
try this out also about this elf HD
lifting concealer in lights I've never
tried this before from elf so I'm super
excited about that and then I did get
this which is really interesting this is
the elf hydrating under eye primer
it just says surprise underneath the eye
area to prevent concealer from settling
into fine lines and wearing off but I
can't wait to try this out if you guys
don't see like first impressions with
this kind of stuff let me know but I
just kind of a ham in the elf section I
just I couldn't help myself
hey brush from them this is the flawless
concealer brush I wanted to try this out
for underneath my eyes kind of like that
perfect perfect shape and perfect size
to just blend right underneath your eyes
and get there close to your lower lash
line so that's what it looks like
elf brushes are actually really good I
like them I got some pointy q-tips
because these are amazing for makeup
absolutely amazing and then all I'm
finding it lip colors this one okay so I
got it elf moisturizing lipstick and
ravishing Rose okay maybe not I'm not
really huge on this one but that's
ravishing Rose right there it's pretty
um it's a little sheer but it's pretty
and then this is the one I'm really
excited about this is the elf matte lip
color in natural I love this packaging
oh it's so light I probably can't wear
that I'm gonna have to try a different
color but that's it right there it's
very very light kind of topi nude okay
so that's all I got from CVS and then I
went ahead and went to Walmart and I got
off makeup brushes so the first one is
this essential tools step three finished
bronzer brush just how fat it was I
wanted it I just want it cuz it's still
fresh it's so cute what I thought this
would be great for bronzer or powder I
mean I feel like you really can't have
enough bronzer or powder brushes as
you'll see and these next couple brushes
I have coming up this is what it looks
like it's a very interesting brush but
oh it's so soft and I cannot wait to
play with this like this is so
interesting yeah cute okay and then I
got a brush from the flower line which
is Drew Barrymore's line ultimate powder
brush you better be because I think you
are expensive at this handle and
everything on this brush is legit it
looks like a really nice brush you know
what this pressure might they have
actually now that I'm thinking about it
it looks like an hourglass brush doesn't
it like it looks just like an hourglass
brush - the handle and then these next
three brushes are from the brand lab -
or lab2 live and breathe beauty and this
first one is the make me blush brush but
I thought this would actually be good
for a bronzer possibly there we go whew
so it has a really nice matte handle
this is sleek I like this these are a
little bit more packed in together kind
of dense but I mean it would be kinda
nice for you know either setting your
under eyes or maybe even put on blush or
even just adding like a contour oh I
can't wait to try this out this is a
really nice brush I think these are like
5 or 6 bucks then I did get a blending
brush as well because I haven't tried a
blending brush from the drugstore in
such a long time I can't quite think of
the word but these brush bristles are a
little itchy like they're a little
Scratchy
I think it's hard to find drugstore eye
brushes that are really really nice and
just worth every penny so hopefully this
is good and this is another one this is
the just basic kabuki brush by the same
brand and it's just really cute and I
thought this would probably be really
great for bronzer this is so soft I love
kabuki brushes from robbers and this
reminds me so much of the NARS one that
I have let me show you these look like
super similar this
nars this one's the lab one I mean this
one's a little bit fatter but feel like
very very similar and look very similar
so hopefully we have a do people and
then my camera is dying so I'm gonna try
to get through this but I'm going to
show you what I got this old time real
quick so I did repurchase a couple
things I'll quickly show you those
purchased my dry shampoo from batiste I
absolutely love this it's in the deep
dark brunette I repurchase the skin hide
your cool firming eye gel because I love
these especially if I'm traveling these
are amazing and they make my eyes feel
so a nice and awake and of course I had
another Smashbox pore minimizing primer
for just another one of these because I
have to like always have it backed up
and I just ran out of one so I needed
another one so the next thing I got is
this Naked skin by Urban Decay it's the
ultra finish ultra definition loose
finishing powder I've never tried it but
I got it in the shade Naked medium light
I really love the packaging of it and I
just think this will be really really
nice I haven't I don't know I really
haven't tried too many things from Urban
Decay so I'm hoping this is a good
product then I got this lorac love lust
in lace this was 24 bucks and it's the
pro matte lip color set
I love the pro matte things like the lip
colors from lorac so I was like okay I
shall get this one and cute cause it has
like limited edition packaging so oh I
love that middle shade I used it before
I actually have this shade this isn't
the color pink taupe one of my personal
faves I've actually had this color for
over a year now and it's amazing and
then this one's in the shade French rose
I don't have this one this looks really
pretty oh that's pretty
so that one's French rose i love these
like matte lip pencils from them they're
so good to keep in your purse and then
this one is the last one and it's
mulberry and it's just a deeper oh my
gosh i love that color that is gorgeous
those are what coming the whole set and
again there were $24 it's just a really
good deal I can't remember how much they
are a piece but I know getting three
full-size for
for is a steel still go check it out
I did also pick up the Maybelline brow
drama and soft brown I just wanted to
try this out for my brows and see how it
worked it's just something new and I
couldn't really find like a bunch of
different stuff from Maybelline but yeah
I just wanted to go ahead and pick that
up the last thing I purchased is this it
cosmetics brush I didn't realize how
many brushes I purchased but I think I'm
pretty much set on brushes now but this
is I don't know what to call this
oh it's the airbrush essential bronzer
obviously everything I buy is for prom
sir oh look at it is so oh my gosh is so
soft and it's just perfect the little
handle is great to just buff everything
in and oh my god I cannot wait okay guys

flashing in my face right here but I
