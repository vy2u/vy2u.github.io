another home video I went to CVS today
and Ulta and let me just say what
started this was not the fact that I
wanted to do a haul what happened was I
went to save yes to get my favorite
lashes of the moment by Ardell and then
I was like oh I wonder if there's new
stuff from the drugstore well there
wasn't a lot of new stuff but I got
things that I've never tried before and
then I was like let me mosey on over to
Ulta which is actually like 30 minutes
away so it wasn't like a great anyways
so I'm moving on over to Ulta and I
couldn't find a lot of drugstore stuff I
liked and there wasn't like a lot of new
stuff out so I walked over to the
high-end section and just made up for it
I figured I would show you guys what I
got from the drugstore today it is all
makeup products for the most part
there's like a couple different things
in here but I'm excited to share them
with you I'm wearing a couple things on
my face that I'm really excited about so
let's get started okay so the first one
I'm going to show you guys is CVS and
what I want to see yes for wear these
lashes right here these are the Ardell
double-up number 207 I made sure I got
both of them because I love these lashes
so incredibly much and I actually wore
these over the weekend I went to it's
called ring weekend for my boyfriend and
they had like this big formal event and
I wore these lashes to it and it looked
so good in pictures and it looks so
great in person
I love these you can reuse them multiple
times and I just think they're awesome
so the double-up 207's are oh so good oh
well I got silicone cover-ups because I
don't like wearing bras lately I don't
know where it is I've been all about the
bra let's and things but there's some
other kind of cover-ups like this that
are smaller that you stick on to your
boobies and it looks really odd in your
clothing like it looks like you have
nipple covers you know what I'm saying
so hopefully this looks more like a bra
and not like a nipple cover up you know
I'm saying
okay moving on next up I got two of
these
L'Oreal LeMat and lilac lip products
and I probably like so late on these I
feel like things have been out for
forever but this one right here is
called lucky charm I see what you did
there L'Oreal this one's more of that
glossy finish I thought that would be
really pretty for fall and I just loved
the color and then I also got this one
which I'm wearing in combination with
another shade I'll tell you guys about
and this is these cheese so matte and
obviously it's a matte shade and it is
really pretty
I like this by itself and with the color
that I have on right now so that's this
one very very pretty surprised I haven't
jumped on that bandwagon like months ago
because I feel like they've been out for
a while I also kind of went a little
cray-cray with Milani because first off
I did not know they had matte lipsticks
like when did this happen this is what I
have mixed with that L'Oreal shade this
is the match Beauty number 69 lipstick
and of course this is just more of a
darker nude but hello my favorite kind
of color you don't need a high-end
lipstick to get the darker nudes you can
just pop this one on right there
and you are good and then I got this one
called matte darling which is a nice
Bobbi pink shade and again I thought
this one would be pretty nice for like
fall and transitioning especially mixing
with drops of nudes I just thought it'd
be great and then this one is of course
a really dark purple
it's called MACT fearless and I just
love this this one's so pretty so that's
it right there I can't wait to wear it
and then I bought two eyeshadows
from Milani these are the Bella eyes gel
powder eyeshadows I've never used these
before but they looked interesting to me
and I like I remember seeing videos of
these like way back in the day so this
one is in the shade I have both of these
on my eyes today this was in Bella
cappuccino which this is the one I use
as a transition shade because it's not
too too pigmented it's right there and
then we have this one which I have mixed
on my lid with another shade but this
one is mostly underneath my lower lash
line and it is in Bella copper and it
was a metallic shade and it is
for shade and I really do like this like
how pretty I love colors like this
they're my favorite
look at that shade oh oh and the last
thing that I got keeps that receipt the
last thing that I got from Milani is
this blush which I'm wearing right now
which you probably can't tell at all but
this is in the shade romantic rose and I
don't think I have this oh gosh I don't
think I have this color I don't think so
I haven't even looked at my blush or yet
but I just thought it was pretty and
it's more of like a mommy pink so that's
it right there it's just a nice light
blush and I like kind of lighter blushes
like this that just give that natural
flush so yeah I liked it nothing too
crazy but this nice moving on to the fun
stuff all right we've got a lot to cover
in here so first thing I'm going to show
you is very boring but a basic girl
needs this which is me batiste dry
shampoo for dark hair I love this stuff
live for it I cannot be without it if I
do not happen in my life I go crazy and
have multiples
also I got these these are the skin I
believe s KY and skin Iceland hydro cool
firming eye gels I was just really
interested in this eye you're supposed
to use this like in the morning time but
I also want to use it at nighttime you
know I'm gonna use it whenever I want
but it helps firm and deep puffs within
minutes
so if you have a hard time with your
eyes like being really puffy and like
super tired in the morning try these out
I've never tried them so I will
definitely keep you guys updated I find
that I gels and I things like this are
really intriguing to me and I like them
more than like the full on face sheet
mask so I can't wait to try them
hopefully it's really good and I
understand that I have like this line
right here for my self tanner and
foundation and then it's because I just
self tamed my body and it's like
darkening up as my face is staying the
same color so don't mind me I thought
some of these these are the Neutrogena
makeup removers and night calming I like
this because I feel like these are
really sensitive and nice for my skin
because I have rosacea very sensitive it
will flame up like that if I use
something it does not
like and this is nice for either nights
that I just don't have the energy to
take off my makeup or if I need to clean
up after I've washed my face so I like
these a lot
they are my absolute favorite for
sensitive skin all right on to the fun
stuff first off the lashes I'm wearing
today I'm so glad I got all of them I am
that kind of person where if I find
something I love I buy all of them
because chances are of a hard time
finding them next time
these are the Vegas nay I'm wearing them
like I said right now the Vegas nay I'll
or glandt grande
glamour these are reusable they're
lightweight and they're beautiful I love
them
this is them in the packet right here
how beautiful I had to cut quite a bit
off of these to fit my eyes which is
actually oh it's gonna freak you have
bigger eyes but you get small eyes you
have to cut a lot off but these are my
new faves I love them I love them these
the Ardell ones and the ones I must show
you are so good
I love these and I don't know if you
guys remember but I mentioned these bad
boys like months back they're the aisle
or number 126 is I love them I can never
find them in my Ulta and I saw them
today and I was like I think they are so
beautiful they're so fun and that's what
they look like they're like the Ardell
ones but just a little bit fuller in a
little bit spike here alright moving on
to other stuff I got this this is so
exciting to me this is each heart swirl
power cheek brush this reminded me of a
giant version of the Nara eita brush
look at this I didn't even know that
this like existed I was so shocked when
I saw it but it has pretty much like
this same idea it's just thicker so it
could be good for blush it could be good
for bronzer or doing like a light
contour I just think this is gonna be a
really fun brush to work with it's
really soft and I love it I just I can't
wait to use it I'm so excited about it
this is the Mallee effortless airbrush
highlighter and blush I always look at
these highlighter and blush combos
whenever I am at Ulta just because the
highlighters are so beautiful and I need
them in my life
and this isn't the one that I wanted but
the other one was sold out and I was
like well whatever I'll just buy this
one okay so first off I don't really
like the packaging I hate to say it I
just don't like it but the product on
the inside oh my gosh these come out I
have to figure that out I don't know
looks like these come out of the pallet
look at that but this is a highlighter
this is the blush the blush reminds me
of NARS orgasm and then this is a
highlighter oh my gosh I'm wearing the
highlighter right now isn't it so stakin
pretty oh my girl's gonna love it so the
blush is a little bit more peachy with
like a golden tone to it and then the
highlighter is more gold as well oh my
gosh new favorite highlighter honestly I
cannot get enough of highlighters lately
I just I can't and this one is pretty
much taking the cake right now
and then I got a travel hairbrush
because I'm traveling a lot lately so I
needed one nothing
nothing fancy that okay moving on to one
of the most exciting things because I've
tried it today I was really nervous to
try it because I don't like to try new
foundations like right before I film
because I'm like well if it's box that's
gonna suck but these are gorgeous I've
not heard anyone talk about these and I
am obsessed already obsessed
so steal a perfectly poreless putty
perfection so I have the shades tan and
medium I'm wearing tan right now which I
think after I wash myself tan off will
match really well but oh my gosh let me
read the back to you real quick if
you're not interested just scroll like
five seconds but I want to read it to
you because it's such a different
product that I've never tried before and
it's so interesting but it says perfect
your skin with natural matte
undetectable coverage that looks like
skin and not makeup
bouncy to the touch it's unique multiple
texture minimizes the appearance of
pores and offers moisturizing properties
perfectly poreless putty perfects
the fact that I could say those four
piece conceals skin toned imperfections
leaving skin looking airbrushed to
perfection complete with the sponge it's
also perfect mattifying touch-up on the
go obsessed honestly I have nothing bad
to say about it right now this really
does look like skin it makes you look
flawless and once I
it with my laura mercier translucent
powder this is a matte finish like
straight-up matte finish if you don't
like matte you will not like this
product and another thing I love about
it is I put my concealer on which I was
nervous about because it was so mad but
it my concealer blended perfectly
it doesn't look caked up on my nose with
concealer it is just so gorgeous so this
is the packaging right here so this does
come with a sponge
I used my Beauty Blender and I liked
that a lot better but I'm going to keep
this in here just in case I'm traveling
or need to touch up on the go because
this is really convenient that young
foundation and a compact I can't breathe
because I'm out of breath so just right
now it's vigorous to get another SD card
but it has this little thing right here
hold on I'm getting there okay it just
pops up in like that and then there's
your product it's so interesting to me
because it is a soft velvety foundation
but you put on your skin and it just it
feels so smooth if you end up going to
an Ulta just dip your fingers in it and
put it on the back your hand and just
you'll see what I'm talking about it's
so crazy I honestly didn't have high
hopes for it but I'm so in love with it
already that I just I can't say enough
good things about it because it really
does make my skin look flawless like I'm
obsessed with it so definitely check
that out I'll keep you guys updated
though because you guys are high and
with foundations I'm very picky but so
far I'm liking it this is a Becca ombre
nudes I palette and this is just so
pretty it's really basic and simple and
all matte neutral shades but I love it
you could use this a contour you can use
it for your eyes you can use it for your
brows whatever so that's what it looks
like I'm traveling a lot like I said I
know I keep saying it but I really am
and I think this will be great for
traveling just for like a multi-use
product and I really like it the colors
are very very pigmented like look at
that oh my gosh it's just so pigmented
like what more do you need in life with
a nude palette I mean that's so
beautiful I also use this today and
really liked it it's the Laura Geller
baked impressions bronzer it's water
resistant and matte
and it's in the shade medium I don't
really go into Laura Geller that much
but there's some products she has that
are just like gold mines and I really
like this one I use it to contour today
it reminds me of benefits hoola bronzer
that's what it looks like and that's a
swatch of it it just looks like benefits
hoola like it looks like it wouldn't be
that dark but on your skin it just
creates the perfect shadow underneath
that cheekbone so I really like it a lot
it's a very soft powder really really
easy to blend and so far so good
I like it a lot okay the next thing is
this anastasia beverly hills dipbrow
this is in soft brown this is right use
for my brows now I love it I just wanted
to back up because I feel like every
time I go to Ulta they're almost obvious
stuff is sold out so I want to make sure
I had a backup because mine's kind of
drying out and it's only halfway done
okay last two things I have this NYX
butter gloss in the shade praline I
might have this I'm not gonna lie but I
don't know so I just went ahead and
bought it and I like a matte lip like
this one like a matte darker nude but
sometimes my lips are a little dry and
with winter coming up or with fall and
winter coming up my lips are gonna get
even more dry so I decided to get this
just to top off those colors because it
just goes along with a color scheme and
it will moisturize my lips because these
are awesome and then I saw the other day
that my exposed chubby limp lip pencil
from NYX was all kinds of messed up so I
had to get another one
because I love this color so that is
exposed right there so pretty exposed in
sable or my two favorite colors of these
they're the NYX simply nude lip creams
and those are my two favorite colors
stable and exposed and yeah when I saw
that one was messed up I was like I need
another one okay guys so that is it for
this video I really hope you enjoyed it

miss out on any of my videos I will have
