a drugstore versus high end video and
I'm really excited about this because
the series that I now love to start on
my channel a lot of you been requesting
for me to do more things with drugstore
makeup and I figured this would be the
perfect way to kind of see if you should
splurge or save your money on certain
products that claim to do basically the
exact same thing so I'm really excited
about it and if you guys are interested
in me continuing this series and then
give this video a thumbs up I'll try to
do it as often as possible it's just I
have to get the products try them out
for like a week or so and then come back
and let you guys know what I think but
if you have any products that come up on
the top of your head of what I should
compare next leave them in the comments
below I will be more than happy to look
through them and go and buy these
products and test them out for you guys
also I really quickly want to address
this finger so basically Sunday morning
I was outside with Daisy and she was
running around and I went to grab her
leash and she took off and the leash
wrapped around my finger and ripped the
nail off and if you guys follow me on
Twitter you saw the gross picture the
after picture you know you saw it all so
it's really swollen I decided to go to
the doctor today since the swelling has
not gone down and still a lot of pain
but he put a little splint on it and
gave me some antibiotics to take this is
what I'm working with right now that's
why my hair is not done and it's
bothering me because I need to wash my
hair the only thing I wanted to make
sure was that I did not get an infection
because it started looking gross around
my nail and I was really getting nervous
that we'll be trying to do a tutorial
for you guys really soon I have a Kim
Kardashian inspired one that I want to
do it's a colorful look something a
little bit different and I'm really
excited to film it for you so that
should hopefully be my next video up as
long as this finger doesn't get in the
way because today it was a little bit of
a challenge so let's just get on to the
what this video is about and that is
about to be it cosmetics CC cream versus
the Garnier BB cream I just kind of feel
like the whole BB CC trend is all one
mumbo jumbo thing that does the same
thing that's one thing even though these
are BB and CC creams I always apply a
moisturizer I never skip
on that that's just personally what I
like to do I just I don't trust these
products to have my moisture in them you
know what I'm saying I'm not going to
make this video ten minutes long and I
make sure I cut it down to just get to
the bullet points for you guys so for
the Garnier BB cream the price of this
is from ten to fourteen dollars just
depending on where you get it and you do
get two fluid ounces now for the it
cosmetics CC cream you can get this at
Ulta or a cosmetics calm and it is one
point eight fluid ounces so you get a
full fluid ounce extra in this one will
not a full one but almost a full ounce
extra in this and you're paying less
than you are for this one so that's the
price of these now the color range I
believe that there are four shades of
this I could be wrong but I will let you
guys know here in the screen right now
I'll go look it up for you but I can't
remember but the two shades
I have are tan and medium and tan is the
one that I use when I'm more tan like I
am now and mediums the lighter shade for
when I'm not as tan and I'm not side as
much and now for the garden a BB creams
this is the one for combination to oily
skin I really quickly want to mention
that I highly suggest this one over the
regular one just because the other one
is very greasy it'll just make your skin
look like a slip and slide mess I know
some people with really dry skin love it
but I know a lot of the people that have
tried it just despise it so make sure
you get the combination to oily skin one
but anyways the color range on this one
is you have a light and then you have a
light medium medium/deep and then a deep
so you get four different shades in this
as well of course I got the light medium
in the medium deep it's a kind of
mix-and-match right now I do have medium
deep on my face it's a little light but
it's nothing a little bronzer can't help
and you can see it just it looks good
with the rest of my body it looks fine
okay I'm going to start off with the
pros and cons of the it cosmetics CC
cream first off this does have an SPF 50
which i think is absolutely amazing I
love anything with SPF in it and another
pro about this is it has really really
great coverage I like to apply this with
like the Sigma f80 or something like
that and it just has awesome coverage it
has a great pump and the color selection
is
pretty much amazing moving on to the
cons of this product I do not feel like
this holds up at all throughout the day
I can wear this for probably I'd say two
hours and it starts looking really caked
up on the face and just messy like it
doesn't look like I took time to do my
makeup listen it makes my skin look
worse than it actually is that's the
biggest thing about this product that I
do not like I really just regret buying
it I regret buying both of them because
that's $80 that I spent to you know try
these products out but like I said the
coverage is great I don't know if it's
because my skin super oily or what but
it just did not hold up but even if I
touch my face it would just kind of
smear off and also another thing about
this is I do have rosacea and covered it
really well on my cheeks but when it
came to my nose I could not get it to
cover as well as the rest of my face so
it was like a little bit patchy and you
can see little parts of redness on my
nose which that bothers the crap out of
me I can't handle it so that's what I
don't like about this product but like I
said great coverage just not
long-lasting at all um packaging is
awesome as well but for me it just
didn't work now for the Garnier BB cream
and this you guys I'm using this for
over a year now and I love this product
I have it on my face today like I said
and this does have SPF 20 which is also
great and honestly I have only one bad
thing to say about this the only bad
thing I will say it is it's not really
bad but it's just kind of a caution
thing it is very liquidy so when you're
pouring this stuff out or you're
squeezing it out be very careful because
it will come out like crazy like it will
just go all over the place so just be
careful very very liquidy product but
this again is just like a full coverage
foundation it just covers everything i
rosacea any acne I have and it makes my
skin look awesome it's very lightweight
on the skin and it never looks cakey at
all throughout the day I've even won
this to the gym a cup
times and throughout the sweat and
everything this held up and looked
amazing I could even blow up my face and
it stayed put obviously you guys can
tell that I prefer the gardenia BB cream
over the it cosmetics one just save
yourself some money and try this baby
out because I think it's the best BB
cream I've ever tried I've tried so many
different high-end ones I tried some
low-end ones as well this one is by far
the best one and it's from the drugstore
you can find this in the skincare aisle
at the drugstores I know when this first
came out I thought it was going to be in
the makeup aisle but it was actually in
the skincare aisle where Garnier is
located and just make sure you get the
combo to oily skin because they all look
the same so just make sure you keep that
in mind when you're checking it out as
well if you guys are excited about this
series and please give it a thumbs up I
would love that you were support and
just liking the video so I know you guys
still want me to continue to do this
series I thought it was different from
