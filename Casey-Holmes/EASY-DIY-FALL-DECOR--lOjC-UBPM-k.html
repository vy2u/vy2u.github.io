in free no place to be
- hey guys so today's video is going to
be a DIY fall decor video I am so
excited about this video because I love
doing DIYs and you guys seem to really
enjoy them so I figured it's fall time
it's about time to do one for fall so
since Michaels is having such a huge
discount on all their things I figured
out pick some stuff up and make some
DIYs for you all and I really like the
way that everything turned out I think
you guys are really gonna love it I've
been trying to do more like lifestyle
DIY stuff on my channel if you guys do
love DIYs then just give this one a
thumbs up and if there's any other types
of videos kind of like DIYs that you
want to see then let me know in the
comments below and I just want to
include my babies in this intro because
a lot of you are asking about them in my
apartment tour like where are they and
they were at my mom's house because if
they were here they would have had toys
and stuffing everywhere this is Lily if
you're new to my channel and then this
is Daisy they're gonna they're still
here don't worry they're just chillin
absolutely wild especially Lily but I
love them so yeah I hope you guys enjoy
this video and let's get started okay so
the first thing is we're gonna make our
these mason jars they're really cute and
you can actually use these any time of
the year so I'm gonna take mason jars
some spray paint of my choice Risa I
believe it's called and also some
flowers I didn't include prices in this
video just so you can see kind of like a
roundabout of how much was spent on each
project so if you want to adjust some
things you could so the first thing I'm
going to do is get rid of the top on the
mason jar and I'm gonna take this spray
paint and I'll put the names of the
spray paint down below and I'm gonna
wrap a little grocery bag around my hand
just so I don't get spray paint on my
wrist and I'm gonna go ahead and put
this dark kind of burgundy color and
spray this on top and then I wanna take
the orange and I'm going to spray the
jar as well I'm kind of mixing these two
just to make my own shade and kind of
give it a little bit more dimension and
I really like the way that they turned
out this spray paint is also matte so it
looks so gorgeous
really southern and I really like it a
lot and the colors are perfect for fall
so I'm just gonna repeat the process I
do the red one first and then the orange
and I just kind of you know make it
however I want
I wanna be scared oh no and you just
want to let them dry it took about 10
minutes to dry you guys and not long at
all and then this is what they look like
they're nice and matte then you would
take your fake bougie-ass hours and fold
the bottoms up
just so they sit lower in the jar and
then kind of adjust your flowers and you
are all set so I'm just gonna go ahead
and do this with the three bouquets that
I have
now I wanted to kind of spice these up a
little bit so I did take this reefa
stuff and I decided to wrap it around
the jars for the smaller one I did wrap
it around the middle and then for the
other bigger jars I wrapped it around
the top but I wrapped them around
probably three times and then just tied
it in a bow and then cut off the excess
I feel like it just gives it a more fall
vibe it looks really pretty and a little
bit rustic so I loved these a lot
Oh dog
next up we're making this cute scarecrow
what inspired me to do this is I really
wanted some straw but I couldn't have
any outside my apartment because I don't
have grass so I'm getting strong my
choice of basket a little scarecrow to
Garland's some acorns and a fake pumpkin
so the first thing we're going to do is
take the basket and put some straw in it
I filled mine up about half way and I
just didn't want it to be like too full
to where I couldn't put stuff in it so I
did it about half way and I recommend
doing this straw stuff outside because
oh my gosh it got so messy and then I'm
gonna take my Scarecrow and I'm gonna
pull him out of his hay and it was
perfect cause he had a little stick on
his butt so he just sat perfectly in the
basket so I'm gonna sit him in the
corner and then put the fake pumpkin
right next to him and then I'm gonna
take the garland and I'm just going to
measure this around and I cut off any
excess that needs to be cut off and I
like the leaves in this because it makes
it look really outdoorsy and pretty so I
just loved it a lot he looks like he's
sitting outside right
so what are you gonna do in the world
don't orbit around you
so after that I'm just gonna put in a
little bit more straw just to kind of
you know fluff it up a bit and then I'm
taking these cute acorns and just
tossing them in here just to make it
look you know outside ish and then he is
done I absolutely loved this one I just
think it is so cute
you might basil one next up we're making
this a fall candle holder and I love
this this one is definitely little bit
more time-consuming so you're gonna need
a bowl your favorite candle the risa
again glue your choice of fillers and
also leaves that you would want so this
does take a little bit more time but I
really love the outcome of it I was kind
of nervous at first because obviously
this was the first time I was trying it
and the glue was kind of hard to work
with I definitely had to sit there and
hold the leaf on there for a hot minute
but once it sets it will not go anywhere
so in this pack of leaves it has a pack
of small leaves and larger leaves
I took the smaller leaves and just
wrapped it around I don't want the top
of the leaf to be too much over the bowl
just maybe poking out a little bit but
since I'm gonna be having flames right
there I don't you know want anything to
catch on fire so just be careful about
that but I'm just gonna stick these
leaves on in no particular order just
however I feel like they need to go on
and I recommend doing this with your
hand just to kind of press the leaf onto
the bowl just so it sets in place really
nicely so this is what it looks like
when you've done that and then I'm
taking the bigger leaves and just
stuffing them in the bottom just so
there's some added color down there go
cry again yo mama
and then you could leave it like this if
you wanted to and just toss your little
candle in there and you can't see the
name or anything if you have a bath and
Bodyworks candle and it looks really
cute but I like mine a little bit more
elevated so I'm gonna take these acorns
and just kind of do a mixture of the
orange and the brown ones and then kind
of level them out and then put your
candle on top and I just think it looks
really cute so I want to spice it up
just a little bit more and I'm gonna
take this raffia I don't know what this
stuff is called
I know I'm gonna be like getting hounded
for this but I'm going to wrap it around
the bowl and again like the candles I'm
gonna just tie it up and cut off the
excess and you're done it's really
really cute and super festive I love
this much more than any other bath and
Bodyworks can't go hold her next I'm
doing this birdcage this is a fun pop of
color to have so I'm taking a birdcage I
got on sale two things of Garlin
pinecones
pumpkins and a little acorn which is
just what I wanted to fill it with you
could totally put a fake bird in there
if you wanted to but I thought that was
a little bit creepy and I didn't want it
looking at me so I'm gonna take the
birdcage and fill it up about halfway
with this Garland baby I don't know is
that you take me high give me tell that
you drive me crazy
I can't get you out my mind think of you
when I'm going to bed only no wake up
think of you again and then I'm just
gonna start putting the stuff that I
bought in there so I'm taking a couple
pine combs a couple of the pumpkins
whatever you want to put in here do it I
mean it's whatever your heart desires
it's just a fun way to add pops of color
and to also kind of have the fall
Thanksgiving theme and I think the
birdcage gives it more rustic look so I
just loved it so I also did add a little
bit of the garland in the top as well
and just to have a little bit more color
up there you don't have to do this if
you don't want to but I just did it
because I loved all the color and I
really like the way that it turned out
its super easy project to do and it was
pretty affordable as well last up we're
doing this DIY a chalkboard pumpkin so
this is really really easy you're just
gonna need a large pumpkin this one is
fake and then your chalkboard paint then
a chalk marker so what you're gonna do
is just take your pumpkin outside and
just spray it all over with chalkboard
paint and I just did mine with the spray
going vertical it was the easiest I felt
like so you just want to make sure the
pumpkin is completely covered
you're the reason why I'm dancing and
singing
and I don't know if you guys been seeing
this lately but the black pumpkins are
totally in especially the chalkboard
pumpkins so this is just fun to make and
you can make this with like your family
or friends I really love it so after
that you want it to definitely dry
overnight and then you're good to go
ahead and draw on it so I'm just taking
my chalk marker I feel like it's just
easier it is a little bit difficult to
draw on these pumpkins but you know what
just take your time and you'll do a
great job so you can decorate it however
you want and when you're done this is
what it looks like so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this DIY video if you did
