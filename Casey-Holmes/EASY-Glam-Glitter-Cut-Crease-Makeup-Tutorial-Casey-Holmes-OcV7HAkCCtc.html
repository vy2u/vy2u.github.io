with you this makeup look I really
wanted to experiment with these new
Urban Decay liquid moonstone eyeshadows
and I was super nervous about trying it
because liquid our shadows kind of
freaked me out but these are so good now
I do have to say I use a glitter glue
with them just because I wanted to be on
the safe side make sure none of this
glitter like fell all over my face but
as I was applying the eyeshadow I found
that I had a lot of control over it and
there was a glitter like falling out
everywhere so I'm kind of obsessed with
these I'm not even gonna lie like I
think I'm gonna be using them a non-stop
just because it was so easy to use I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
do like it don't forget to give it a
thumbs up don't forget to subscribe I
will leave a link right here that you
can click or if you're on a mobile
device I will have one in the
description box right at the very top so
yea if you want to see how I got this
makeup look then let's just go ahead and
get started okay so I'm gonna go ahead
and prime my eyes with my NARS smudge
proof eyeshadow primer and then today
we're gonna be going in with this market
Jacobs palette this is a new palette
from them and it's pretty expensive but
I really love the shades and and so far
it's been a really great palette but if
you guys want a full review just let me
know in the comments below but I'm gonna
take it the lightest vanilla shade and
I'm gonna apply that all over my lids as
a base then I'm taking the second shade
in the palette which is a nice mid-tone
color I'm going to lightly blend this
into the crease and I am gonna build
this color up as I go this look is so
easy we're just doing a couple colors in
the crease and then that pop of glitter
all over the lid
honestly it's such an easy fun look I
love it and I hope you guys loved it as
well but like I said I'm gonna go ahead
and build this color up into the crease
and make sure I really blend this out
nicely
going in with this shade right here
which is one of my new favorites I'm
going to put this directly into the
crease just a little bit below that to
first shade that we put on and also a
little bit above the crease I want my
lid to appear larger so I'm just going
to hollow out to my socket on my eye and
I love this Mac brush when I want a
precise application is perfect it's a
short-haired blending brush it's tightly
packed but it's not too packed to where
it can still blend out eye shadow really
nicely so after I've applied that and I
get it how dark that I want I will go
ahead and take the first brush that we
use and I will blend out the edges this
eye shadow is really easy to blend so
that's another reason why I really love
it but I also love the Urban Decay
ultimate basics palette I've tried that
lately and it is so good so I can't
decide this one or that one now we're
going to go ahead and take the white
shade and put this all over the lid just
to have a nice light base for the
glitter that we're going to put on
out this is not a necessary step but I
did go ahead and put toothpaste glitter
glue on my eyes and this is good for
loose glitter and loose pigments and
things like that but honestly with this
product you do not need it because it
stays in place all day without the
glitter glue so I'm gonna take the
liquid moon dust eyeshadow from Urban
Decay and I'm just basically gonna paint
this all over my lid and cut out to that
crease so as you can see this is such a
pigmented product honestly there's no
spaces in between anything like you know
sometimes when you get glitter eyeliners
or something they're just not as intense
and you have to go over them a thousand
times that is not this product one swipe
and you've got full glam glitter on your
eye I absolutely love it honestly these
are my new favorite things and I'm gonna
keep saying that because I'm just so in
love with them this is gonna be so easy
for a holiday season and doing fun
glittery looks I'm just obsessed with it
next up I'm just going to go ahead and
take that color we've put in the crease
and use a pencil brush and I'm going to
go right along the edges of that glitter
liner and I'm just very lightly blending
this color on the edges just to make
sure they blend together seamlessly
after that you can go ahead and take
your tape off and you have a nice sharp
line and then I'm using these Vegas nay
I'll or grande glamour lashes then going
on to this Bobbi Brown skin Perfector
I'm just trying this out I got it as a
sample so I wanted to test it out I
still like my Canon Austin one better
but you know and then I'm using these
Smashbox Studios Skin Foundation in 2.4
I first use it with a brush and I get a
light layer all over my face
and then I like to just go in with my
Beauty Blender and touch up the redness
on my cheeks just a little bit so it has
more of a full coverage finish this is
definitely a nice buildable foundation
it has a natural skin effect but it does
cover quite a bit so I just like to go
in the brush and then with a Beauty
Blender to it build it up because I feel
like that looks the most natural and I
really enjoy it
again when my newest favorite concealer
is the Smashbox Studios skin 24-hour
concealer I love this stuff you guys it
is just such a great concealer I love
using it because it looks like skin and
it blends so well and it never creases
I'm just obviously I cannot say enough
good things about it so I'm going to
blend this out underneath my eyes and
the center of my face
then I'm going in with my flower Beauty
translucent powder you guys might love
this it's honestly my favorite
translucent powder at the moment it's
just so good and you can get it from
Walmart and then we're gonna go ahead
and move on to brows and I've been using
this product so much just because I love
it
this is the benefit cobrowse and it is
so easy to work with I just love it I
love tall maids like this because I feel
like it doesn't take much time at all to
sell on my brows this color is perfect I
will leave the color down below but
sometimes I'll use this pomade sometimes
I'll just go ahead and use the Gimme
brow because the Gimme brow has little
fibers in it as well so even on like a
natural day so even I'm doing a new so
even when I'm doing a natural look for
the day or if I just want to fill in my
brows because you guys know I have a
sparse brow right now I'll just use the
Gimme brow and then like go to the gym
or run errands
after I filled them in I like to go
ahead and conceal and I use the little
brush that comes with a Cobra just to
get a nice precise line and really
sharpen them out and then I'm going to
use the 3d brow tones my benefit which
is so nice because it adds like little
highlights to your brows and I like it
because it lightens up my brow and helps
them match my hair just a little bit
more and make them look more natural
we're gonna go ahead and dust away our
baking and then we're moving on to one
of my favorite parts which is bronzer I
love this bronzer so much is from
Neutrogena it's in the shade a 30
Sunkist and it's just such a beautiful
warm sunkissed color I'm using a Tom
Ford bronzer brush brush really I'm
using it Tom Ford bronzer brush to blend
this out all over my skin and you could
just see right there how bronzed this
bronzer is it's just amazing
so I'm also gonna apply it to my cheeks
and down my neck as well just to give
some more color to those areas
except I'm taking this Physicians
Formula bronzer and I'm going to contour
with it I literally tap my brush in
there twice just a tiny bit and this is
how pigmented this thing is it is so
pigmented but it blends out really well
and I love it it really chisels those
cheekbones and makes them pop so highly
recommend this you guys my favorite
contour powders of the moment then I'm
taking this Fionna Stiles blush and I'm
going to apply it with an elf blush
brush and I'm just lightly dusting this
color on my cheeks I don't want to take
away from the eyes but I do want a
little bit of color so I applied that to
my cheeks and then blend it out with a
duo fiber brush just to diffuse it
then for highlight I'm taking this wet
and wild boozy brunch highlighter and
hello this is amazing you guys know I
love it a lot of these products were
mentioned in my August favorites so here
you go you're seeing them in action but
I absolutely love this highlighter I
think it's the best highlighter from the
drugstore
next up I'm going to take that
highlighter and I'm also going to put
this underneath my brow just to
highlight the area and lift it up a
little bit more
next I'm taking my NARS eyeliner in Via
Veneto you guys know I love this it's
been my holy grail product for the
longest time now but if you want a more
affordable option you can try the NYC
waterproof smooth eyeliner is amazing so
after I've done that I'm going to take
that shade that we used in the middle of
our crease and put that on the outer
half of my lower lash line with a pencil
brush then I'm going to take the liquid
eye shadow and I'm going to put this in
the beginning half of my eye and around
my tear duct area just to make this pop
you can do as little as you want as much
as you want I honestly just love the
extra pop that it adds to the look then
I'm going to put mascara on my lower
lashes and for lips we're lining our
lips with this Palladio lip liner and
salmon then we're also going to take
their Velvet Matte cream lipstick in raw
silk and put this on top of our lips I
love these by the way I think they're
awesome they feel so good on the lips
and then that is it for this makeup look
so I hope you guys enjoyed it please
give it a thumbs up if you did thank you
so much for watching and I will see you
all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
