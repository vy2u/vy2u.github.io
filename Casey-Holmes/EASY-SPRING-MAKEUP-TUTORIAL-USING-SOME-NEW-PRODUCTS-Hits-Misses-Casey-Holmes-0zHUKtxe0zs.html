gonna be doing a kind of like a lighter
spring at makeup look for you not like
as in tinted moisturizer light but
something that is not as heavy as like
the smokey eyes that I do all the time I
also have some new products to share
with you and kind of show you things I
don't really know how I feel kind of
like this cover FX power play is it
power yeah
power play foundation also have some new
things to try out like this milk a full
coverage concealer the milk makeup the
full coverage concealer I'm also gonna
be applying lashes today but they're not
gonna be as dramatic as what you guys
are used to seeing me do these are
really gorgeous an administrative like
how you can really enhance your lashes
that you already have with these and
these are the kiss blowout lash and I
really like them make your natural
lashes look like you have like lash
extensions on so if you guys are
interested then definitely keep watching
don't forget to subscribe before you
leave and hit that cell I know that's
like a big thing right now and you guys
are probably sick and tired of hearing
every single creator say this but if you
do want to see it my videos pop-up and
you want to be notified then definitely
hit the bell right next to the subscribe
button and you'll be notified hopefully
so without further ado let's just go
ahead and get started I'm pretty sick I
got these dry bar Clips for free when I
bought my wand or was it I think was at
Ulta I got the clips for free or maybe
Sephora I don't know I think was all
tough but now I can't find the other
ones and they're like my favorite Clips
ever and I do have hair extensions now
so I'm gonna kind of start with the face
really quickly I'm gonna use an SPF
today this is new I just got this from
Sephora it's the kula 70% organic
full-spectrum at 360 Sun silk drawers
says indoor and outdoor environmental in
digital UVA UVB irh UV protection you
get one fluid ounce this is plant
protection cruelty-free vegan
antioxidant enriched I'm excited to try
this out the box is so cute again I got
this from Sephora I made like a whole
support order and believe it or not like
I made some restocks but I purchased new
stuff and I'm like so disappointed and
like half the things that I got but I'll
mention that in my hits and misses video
this is what it looks like very cute has
one of those pumps where you just go
like this and then take it off so I'm
gonna put this on my hand it's kind of
liquidy I just spilled that everywhere
I'm just gonna put this all over my skin
it kind
smells like fruit loops it kind of
smells beachy it's just a different
mixture but it definitely is lightweight
and I did put it on my neck and stuff so
yeah I just figured I would start
testing this out and see how I like it
for my skin I'm really huge on not
putting like self-tanner on my face not
getting my face super tanned or anything
like that because first off I'm
sensitive my skin is I've had rosacea as
you guys can see my skin is so sensitive
this is nice too because it's not making
it flare up or anything so that's a
really good sign so far what I'm
actually gonna do is gonna go ahead and
prime my eyes I'm gonna use a Smashbox
photo-finish lip primer and put this on
my skin I can definitely feel that serum
like the SPF serum drying down it feels
really nice it feels like plump so the
palette that I pulled today is kind of
perfect for spraying I didn't even think
about it but it's the tartlet in bloom
palette do they still have this I sure
hope so this is what it looks like I
haven't used this palette in so long but
I really loved this color as you guys
can tell they do like I said I want to
keep this kind of lighter so I'm gonna
go in first I'm gonna take this little
Milani travel-size brush and go in with
flower child which is this matte shade
here and I'm going to set my entire lid
with this so that that primer is nice
and smooth and dry and none of our
shadows kind of like stick and get
choppy I'm gonna do is take smarty pants
I love that name and just fluff this
into the crease this is another Milani
travel-size brush they came in a set
together and then there's one more brush
that's like a little fluffy pencil brush
so I'm just gonna fluff this into my
crease I'm not getting too crazy here I
actually filmed another look before this
and then I decided to stop when I was
like halfway through filming because it
was a super warm toned look and then I
messed up my eyelid because I put this
milk makeup eye gloss on my eyes which
it says you can use it for your eyes but
I should have known like I would not
have liked that look cuz I never liked
that look but I did it and I like
completely ruined my makeup look so I
was super bummed about that I'm gonna
take rebel right here and I'm going to
put this into the crease right below
that first shade that we used doing
anything crazy this is just gonna add
some definition applying it this way
with like a really fluffy brush
it's just gonna make it look really
smooth and seamless but also kind of
contour that I so it defines it let me
know if you guys want more kind of
simple looks I mean there's only so much
I feel like I can do but if you guys
want to see something specific
definitely let me know send me a picture
on Twitter tag me do whatever you want
to do because I'm always looking for
inspiration so now I'm gonna take funny
girl which is such a cute name and we're
going to pop this all over the lid I
really love firecracker I don't know if
you guys could tell this is like one of
my most huge shades so nice I'm gonna
take a funny girl and put this all over
the lid just to bring some life back to
my eyes you can do this with a
highlighter if you wanted to but I'm
taking it all the way from inner corner
to outer corner and I'm using at the top
of this brush if you guys can see it's
kind of rounded taking that top of that
brush and really rounding out that
crease as well I'm just going to lightly
without any extra product go over in the
crease to kind of blend out any harsh
lines I'm gonna take this Mac 266 brush
it's just an angled brush great for
cream eyeliners anything like that I'm
gonna use the shade leader so it's kind
of like a mauve Brown very pretty and
I'm gonna line my upper lash line with
this so this is great because it's gonna
line your lashes add a touch of color
but it's not gonna be super harsh like a
black eyeliner would be this is like a
must-have for me because I'm not
obsessed with my eye shape you know it's
not terrible but I have very droopy eyes
and then my inner corner kind of goes
down if that makes any sense and if I
put on false lashes and I don't do this
it kind of looks wonky so it's good to
just kind of line you don't have to this
if you don't want to but I just prefer
for my eye shape so that's what it looks
like it's just really simple an extra
step that really doesn't take any time
this brush is really great too just
applying that product and kind of
blending it to where it looks a tad bit
smoky but not really so that's what it
looks like when I line the eyes and then
what you could do is take just like a
pencil
this is one from Mac as well this is a
old brush of mine I've had it forever it
even has rows like bite marks on when
she was a puppy but you can also go over
and kind of blend the line just a bit to
diffuse it give it more of a sultry
smoky look nothing too harsh so now what
we're gonna do is curl our lashes and
apply mascara and we're gonna apply
false lashes so this is the lash that
I'm using today and these are great
because if you guys have been watching
me for a while you know I love dramatic
thick lashes like really thick lashes
and these are awesome because they're
really wispy and long and they give you
a lot of volume but they look very
natural like people aren't gonna look at
you and be like well you have really
dramatic lashes on what are those the
band is so thin you can't see it then
glue that we're using is clear so you're
not gonna see that either I also will
let you guys know that kiss is
sponsoring this video so thank you guys
so much for working with me they've come
out with so many different lashes and
I'm a really impressed with and I always
think it's amazing when a drugstore
brand really expands our line and just
has so many different options for people
and that's definitely what they've been
working on and they have launched so
many products so definitely check them
out but this one is the kiss blowout
lash they are the pompadour pompadour
they're full bouncy volume and curl the
next generation wispy these are super
wispy and pretty the adhesive is sold
separately this is the adhesive that is
sold separately so this is the one that
we'll be using today it's just a clear
adhesive it has aloe and it does have a
brush tip and it's $3.99 at Walgreens
anyway so it also says the latest trend
in lashes volumizing back tees
technology so they have a bunch of
different styles like I said I'm gonna
be using this one and I'm also gonna be
sharing with you guys how I apply false
lashes
it also says contact lens friendly
that's good for all you contact users I
usually start with my left eye first I
don't know why I take the lashes out
keep them in front of you and like this
lash goes to this height this lash goes
to this eye whenever you're trimming
your lashes you want to trim from the
outer part so out here in you don't want
to trim the inner corner first because
it kind of just throws off the lash and
it makes it look a little wonky so
definitely cut from the outside going in
do you want to measure them make sure
they fit your eyes they're a little too
long
definitely cut them because you don't
want it to be poking your
corner you don't want it to be kind of
floating all the way out here you
definitely want it to fit your eye and
look as natural as possible so what I
like to do is just bend this back and
then I pull now some people do this with
tweezers I'm a rebel I just pull my
fingers I'm just gentle I go in and I
pull from the outer corner and I gently
take them off that way if I accidentally
pull off some hairs on the outer corner
it's okay because more than likely I'm
going to have to trim them anyways so
I'm going to take the lash and just
measure it first how these are cute okay
what I like to do is put it in the inner
corner I don't take it all the way into
the inner corner near the tear duct area
cuz that's just gonna irritate the crap
out of you and you're gonna hate that
you ever wore false lashes make sure you
kind of start right where your lashes
start to measure them out now these
actually look like they're gonna fit my
eye like perfectly that never happened
like for real I'm gonna trim just a tiny
bit just in case like I'm going crazy
and they actually aren't the same length
so I'm just trimming a tiny bit off of
the ends and then what I'm gonna do is
kind of take this little tray and set it
up as like my drying station so I set to
the side and then I take my eyelash
adhesive which is this right here I'm
one of those people who probably applies
too much but I like to make sure the
whole entire thing is covered that way
they don't move throughout the night
which this adhesive is really nice it
also gets tacky very very quickly and I
do like the brush tip so much better
than squeezing it out of a tube because
sometimes when you squeeze it out of a
tube you can be as gentle as possible
and it just like squirts everywhere
brush is really nice you have a lot of
control you can paint it on and I just
like to make sure there are no spaces
that are free of glue so that's what it
should look like and then I'm gonna set
it over on the drying station right over
there it literally takes just a few
seconds to dry like probably about 30
seconds which is really great and then
I'm gonna quickly do the same with this
eye so I'm going to take my eyelash
curler and curl my lashes I always do
this no matter what because like I said
I have droopy eyes and I want my lashes
to eat up as
bull and then I'm gonna take the essence
volume stylist mascara it doesn't really
matter what mascara use I mean I would
use one of your favorites this one holds
a curl really well I want to say that
this lash adhesive does come in black I
normally use clear if I have no liner
arms I'll use a black glue if I have
liner on that way it just kind of blends
a lot easier I'm gonna take the laughs
I'm gonna grip the center and I lay down
the center first so just pop it right
there and then I go to the inner corner
next and I just place it right there as
close to the lash line as possible and
then I work with this outer corner which
is like the easiest best corner ever and
again just apply that as close to the
lash line as possible you can also press
your lashes together if you want to you
could take your tweezers and just kind
of press down on the lash to make sure
they're secure when your glue is tacky
this makes the whole process so much
easier if your glue is wet your lash
will start moving around you'll be like
what is going on these are for 49 at
Ulta Walgreens and Walmart and literally
the reason why they call it blowout lash
has to be because it literally looks
like your lashes are so fluttery and
full and natural it's amazing okay so
now we're gonna move on to face which is
my favorite and you guys already know we
have so much new stuff you guys like I
just I've been traveling and taking this
stuff with me trying to test it all out
I'm gonna use the talked jet silk canvas
primer I'm sure you guys have heard so
much about this so this was talked about
a lot for a little while there and as
you guys can see I've been testing it
out and to be honest with you I have no
idea how I feel about it
I do use this much I know they say a
little bit goes a long way but this only
lasts six months and even though I got
it for free and PR I just don't want it
to go bad and I put it through my hands
I do feel like it really smooths out my
skin makes makeup application so nice
but I don't I just I don't know how I
feel about it I mean my pores do look a
little bit smaller when I use this
product I don't know if I'm obsessed
with it you know do a new foundation
this is the cover FX power play
foundation another product I've been
trying out
you don't know how I feel so I mean
using in 40 a lot recently just because
I was pretty light for a little bit
there now I'm gonna use a shade g50 the
one thing I do not like about this
foundation is packaging I know it's a
really diva thing to talk about but it's
one of those things I think about like
okay well when you're at the near end of
your foundation you're trying to get it
out just gonna be so hard to squeeze it
because you can only squeeze this bottle
so much and then it's just starting to
kind of hurt your fingers because you're
squeezing it so hard I don't know if
that makes any sense it's one of those
things where I'm just not obsessed with
the packaging out of much rather had a
pump feel like when you get towards the
end you might have to like cut this off
or like take this little cap off because
it looks like you can do that that's
what this looks like I'm gonna use this
with a Beauty Blender I have found that
I like a sponge way better with this
foundation I do not like a brush with it
first time I ever wore this it was with
Davis and he complimented my makeup
without me asking and said my skin
looked really smooth and I was like what
you like this because I put it on and I
didn't really like it so I was like dang
it now I got to try it out it does have
good coverage again like I said I don't
like it with a brush I just feel like it
looks a little messy with a brush if
that makes any sense at all this is the
first time I've used this color and I
don't mind it sometimes I feel like this
can look a little dry this is one of
those foundations where I don't love how
it looks when I first apply it but once
I do my concealer and the rest of my
makeup and I kind of let it sit there
for about an hour I end up starting to
really like it like so on the fence
about this one too it does have more of
a matte finish as well can you guys see
what I'm talking about it just looks a
little too textured and matte but then
when I get finished with my makeup and
everything kind of melts together it
looks really good so now I have this
full coverage concealer from milk makeup
i have the pr little pamphlet here i
want to tell you guys about so it says
it moves with your face and never
creases or cake says the flex seamless
becomes one with your skin it thanks to
a combo of tiny bendable spheres an
elastic marshmallow root powder the
ingredient that gives candy the squishy
abilities oh that is so interesting good
for your face it says it's formulated
with blue lotus and to moisturize and
chamomile to calm the skin that's good
for people with redness like
so you could cover imperfections while
doing something good for your face flex
weightless buildable formula it gives
you medium to full coverage you won't
even feel you can live your life without
having to stop and check your concealer
it's still there
growing shade range the flex concealer
family will double this fall with eight
new shades I think I'm gonna take this
shade first this one is fair oh we have
light medium and fair so we might do
just a mixture of this because my face
is pretty dark to match my neck and my
tan body I'm gonna start with fair first
and just see how this looks fair is not
the lightest that's coming out I think
it's the lightest that is out right now
but there will be in fall 2000 18 you'll
have to lighter shades than this so you
have a little applicator like this let's
go with this eye first and it is smells
like mac prolongwear so I'm gonna take
this down it's pretty light I'm gonna
add a little bit of light/medium in with
that and then I'm gonna go in with my
sponge and we're gonna blend this out
I'll be honest I have not been the
biggest fan of milk makeup because I
never found anything that really worked
for me that well this is looking
actually really pretty but we're gonna
blend this out and see how it looks I
love this Real Techniques sponge so much
some people think this is excessive fair
is definitely too highlighted for me so
light/medium is definitely gonna be my
shade gonna take light/medium over here
so we might not be even I've also been
trying out the YSL Touche I call it the
tush concealer but the two
so fancy but it's really nice I've been
really enjoying it that concealer love
the way this smells I don't know what it
is about mac prolongwear you guys but
it's one of those concealers that I love
light/medium so much more than fair but
Mac Pro Longwear honestly gives me so
many like memories Mac was the first
place I ever went to to buy a higher-end
makeup I didn't even really know much
about Sephora until I started YouTube
but Mac was like the place I needed to
go and I loved and if I wanted to treat
myself I would treat myself with Mac
products and just such good memories
with Mac like I used a lot on this side
because
hey I want to just try it out with how I
normally apply my concealer but it
really blends into like nothing like my
forehead just blended in to my skin so
quickly now I'm gonna take my sponge and
just go over everything
I'm just really pressing everything the
foundation the concealer melting it all
together any harsh line that's what they
both look like on I do really like that
concealer I think it looks really pretty
on the skin and with the I don't know if
I love it the most with this foundation
but I think I'm really gonna like that
concealer a lot okay now we're gonna do
is set the face I'm going to use this
Milani it translucent banana I haven't
used this before I got this in PR and
I'm so excited to test it out so 0-3
translucent banana from Milani they have
the good dispenser where you like can
twist it and turn it off or twist it and
have the sifter like this we're gonna
press this underneath the eye oh my lord
that is so smooth Milani oh my gosh do
you guys see how smooth this is making
my skin powder man life-changing I've
been really into applying powder with a
sponge instead of a brush I just feel
like it really presses it in there and
melts it into the foundation and the
skin and it doesn't look cakey they like
it so I kind of start with my under eyes
kind of like how you would bake but then
if you just keep pressing it it'll
really melt it into the skin and it
gives it this smooth finish do you guys
see that oh my gosh I love that that's
the best part about this so you can turn
it to have this if they're not come off
and if you have some in your lid you
could just so I also got a new bronzer
from Sephora it is the UH Nastasia line
and I was so excited to get this but I
definitely got too dark of a color I got
the shade a rich amber so it's way too
dark to bronze with I am gonna try to
contour with it one more time if I don't
like the way it looks and everything is
too muddy then I will return it and get
a different shade but the formula was
really nice when I did try to contour
with this
so I'm gonna do that again today I just
went through my drawer and I remember I
used to love this bronzer so we're gonna
use at a the Laura Mercier matte radiant
baked powder in bronze oh three I used
to use the bronze Oh to all the time
we're just gonna bronze the skin bronzer
is so important to me this is one of
those bronzers where it just looks like
your skin but a little bit better like
just nice and bronzed and smooth it kind
of doesn't even look like you have
bronzer on obsessed with it and this
brush is from Sonia Kashuk um I know
they revamped everything I got this in
like a little set from them a while ago
but I'm sure they have something very
similar it's just a little dome shaped
brush I forgot how much I love this like
it looks so good on the skin so for
blush money is the ultimate brush blush
so for blush money is the Ulta velvet
blush in princess using this using this
foundation brush from Sephora so and it
is so pretty on the skin and now we're
gonna take that honest Asya bronzer in
rich amber and we're just gonna contour
with this I'm gonna use this morphe in
five-10 I think most people use this for
a highlight but I'm just gonna use it
for contour cuz it's small its fluffy
woah we are coming towards and then
again I'm gonna blend with that MUA
stippling brush just to make sure we're
all blended here okay next is
highlighter my favorites I'm gonna take
this flower Beauty shimmer and strobe
highlighting palette and I'm gonna mix
the shade and the more golden tone it's
so pretty
you know just do like a little dollop of
that really light wine and put it right
on the center I'm gonna take it down
here now I'm just gonna go in with my
Catrice Ultra somatic brow pencils and
just fill in these brows like I normally
do I'm gonna take that same at tartlet
in bloom a palette I'm gonna go in with
later again what we use to line our
upper lash line and we're just going to
press this up against our lower lash
line you could just put a lighter shade
down here if you wanted to we didn't
want anything too dramatic now I'm gonna
take my Mac pencil brush and go in with
the smarty pants shade which is this
really light one right here and blend
that out when you use a brown eyeliner
from pure it's in the shade on a point
we use on my lower waterline it's nice
because it's not as harsh as black and
then I'm also gonna lie in the upper
waterline because this will make your
lashes look a little bit fuller and I
don't really melt them all together to
finish off the eyes I'm going to take
the Wet n Wild mega slim skinny mascara
okay and now I actually want to try out
these new Urban Decay high shine glosses
I'm normally not into glosses but I do
want to try them out for the video so
I'm gonna take this essence soft
contouring lip I'm going to take this
essence soft contouring lip liner and
then I'm gonna go in with the shade feel
first just really pretty
there minty
they remind me of the Mint's that you
get Olive Garden I'm gonna take the
color midnight cowgirl which is like a
little bit lighter has a sheen to it
I just won't see those looks like in the
middle so I really do like it this
makeup look I think it looks so pretty I
think this look is great for pretty much
anything you can use it as a going-out
look it could be an easy lunch makeup
look like if you just want to sit down
and enjoy doing your makeup and do kind
of like a full face it is kind of
springy you know it is pretty light on
the eyes some purple tones highlighted
the gloss it does have a little bit of
the spring vibes and it's just really
fresh and easy to do and then you have
these really gorgeous fluttery lashes
and I just really like it so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and enjoy kind
of chit-chatting with me as we do a
lighter makeup look thank you guys so
much for watching and let me know down
below what you want to see next and I
will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
