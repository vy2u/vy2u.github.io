thursday we are going to be trying the
Lumia makeup brush cleaning device I got
the shade matte black and I've had so
many of you request this video and I was
like you know what let's just fork out
the money and try it out because if it
works this will be used a lot by me like
I will use the crap out of this because
I hate washing my brushes and I figure
this is a great way to kind of conserve
water as well so it says only takes
three easy steps your brushes should be
clean and ready to dry so shows you the
steps right here has like really nice
packaging I like it a lot I'm going to
put in a notation what the price of this
was because I cannot remember and it
also did get the makeup brush cleanser
that actually is for the system I didn't
want to try something else' I figured if
I was spending a lot of money on the
system I would use the cleanser that
goes with it instead of using like
something random so this is what I'm
going to be using if you know of
somebody who has used a different
cleanser with it then totally let me
know because I'm down for figuring it
out but this is a really big bottle this
is 24 fluid ounces like that's huge and
I believe this was like 20 bucks so it's
not too bad to go with the system if
you're gonna spend the like 150 bucks on
the system might as well spend 20 and
get the cleanser I've got my warm water
here and I've got some dirty brushes it
says it cleans up 212 brushes so we
shall see and I'm excited to see how how
many like different handles can fit in
it cuz a bunch of my brushes have like
weird handles so I want to see how they
work out this up and you have the
instructions here on the top oh that was
something I need yeah there's like a
little egg so I'm just going to undo
this
and of course I got matte black because
you guys know I love matte black that's
just my life it illiterate back way so
this is what the inside looks like it
has like a little note what you call
this like little rubberized thing right
here so I'm just going to leave that
right there has a max full line right
here I'm actually going to get it closed
to show you guys that's what it looks
like and you can see right here it says
fill below the max line and then right
here with that little ridges that is the
max line so you don't want to go above
that line with water and these are the
brush handle holders they're kind of
rubberized that they're pretty forgiving
and it looks like this one's for like
big brushes smaller brushes it is twelve
at a time how does it do wait twelve
fifteen at a time
then it's a good 12 at a time I don't
know how this looks like six but this is
a line right here that's going to go to
different colors showing you the process
of how your brushes are being cleaned
you can see right there I think that's
really cute
get started page four oh you have to go
to the website the Lumia gets started to
first read with instructions for use I
kind of don't like that but I'll go do
it like why couldn't you just put it in
here okay anyway so before I look that
up I'm going to show you guys what is in
this little box power cord and then in
this little other pocket there's a
measuring cup which is great because I
brought a coffee cup because I had no
idea and it shows you like one ounce of
soap two ounces of soap and three ounces
of soap and then the water line so I
like that a lot I don't have to rely on
my coffee cup to hopefully get it right
and it's going to be easy because it has
a little tip right there I'll be easy
like you can see right here just to kind
of pour in there I'm gonna watch the
instructions real quick and I'll be back
to show you guys what I'm gonna do okay
so I thought the videos are gonna be
super long but they're only like 40
seconds so I'm gonna have you do them
with me the first thing is this is to
pour liquid step 1
or liquid so you pour warm water into
the clean water area and you're going to
fill right below the maximum line
perfect okay on to the next step what's
that next directly into the disk okay
now we're going to take the cleanser and
put two ounces into this little cup and
it shows you or two ounces is so that's
awesome exactly two ounces and it says
to pour in right on this pink disk be
sure to start from the top of your hair
to the bottom I'm not going to do that
I'm just going to go straight into it I
just want to see if it'll take all of it
out so sorry step three load brushes
insert up to twelve makeup brushes into
the holder from the bottom up so this
comes off so now maybe no no okay what
just got a tug it a little bit harder
okay and now I'm just going to put in my
brushes this is a real techniques brush
it's not fitting then this hole not
fitting into that hole oh no okay row
techniques brush has to fit into the
biggest hole it is a thicker handle but
it's not like super thick you can see it
is a thicker handle but it's not like
crazy how do you fit twelve brushes in
here and I'm like I'm so confused see if
I can double up in the insert I feel
like maybe so I'm not going to work well
but I just put in a pencil brush and a
flat shader brush beside each other
pretty much even so hopefully it will
lean together so we've got a variety of
different size brushes in here we've got
this huge one from Marc Jacobs some
foundation brush blush brush and we have
multiple eyeshadow brushes I have one
two three four five six seven eight nine
in here maybe you could fit like more
eyeshadow brushes if I didn't have so
many face brushes but that's what I got
in here I know it I should probably plug
this in and all of the cleaning liquid
has migrated to the center which is nice
okay so just depending on how thick the
brush is like if it's thinner like the
eyeshadow brushes you can obviously fit
more and if it's thicker like the face
brushes you can fit less and I just I'm
just double checking these brushes and
making sure I don't have them smashed
the only one that's really smashed is
the Marc Jacobs one because it's huge
okay so now it is on the blue light
which is device power on I'm going to on
the egg which has a certain way you put
it on then green means wash cycle
I don't think it's going to do them our
Jacob's brush so I'm just going to take
the Marc Jacobs brush out unfortunately
it's just too big and I'm going to put
this makeup brush in which just has some
foundation on it so this is the wash
cycle but I can't figure out what I'm
doing wrong and why I won't start
I'm going to figure this out and I'll be
right back to give you guys another
update ok we're switching over to the
vlog camera so I could possibly show you
guys how ever impressed wants to start
the 15 minute clean process so let's
just
come on they're all pretty much even I'm
not too sure why it's not starting bro
like are you okay what is going on what
I think I broke it
wait okay we've got something right
probably shove the lid on but don't over
the video so has these ridges that's
supposed to help get it clean you can
see the Foundation's like coming out of
this one
whoa so I guess it's complete now okay
now what do you do they should be done
is gonna take that off it's not clean I
mean okay so they're still soaked but
they're done and you see that's like
dirty water coming out no no no guy who
oh no the eye brushes look good like for
real they look really good but the face
brushes I don't know about okay so I
expected this to go so much better than
it actually did for me if you have this
product let me know how you use it if
you like it I feel like it took me
forever to figure out how to start it it
definitely does not take big brushes so
like that Marc Jacobs brush this Real
Techniques brush it's not going to take
so you might as well just wash those by
hand but the proof is like in the
pudding I mean if they're still dirty
these look great a little bit frayed
like you know their bristles are kind of
everywhere - the Mac 242 and the 219
these are still super dirty and I left
it up here just to clean only two
brushes I took out were the other two
blending brushes which those are really
clean as well I'm not a huge fan of it I
feel like if I were to use this and like
keep it I would want to use it for face
brushes and I would really want it to
deep clean them and really get all the
product out the first time around and
that did not happen with this and also
there was a ton of water in the bristles
I know they're facing down which is
great but like even when
I squeeze them out they're still soaking
wet and there's still some soap in there
and when there's still soap in your
bristles and you're using them that's
just even more bacteria and you don't
want that on your face you want to get
all the soap all the water out of your
brushes this did not go as planned I'm
super like upset about it that really
really sucks I don't even know how I'm
going to clean this thing yet but I'm
gonna figure it out and I will let you
guys know in the description box so
check the description box to see how I
cleaned it if you guys found this video
