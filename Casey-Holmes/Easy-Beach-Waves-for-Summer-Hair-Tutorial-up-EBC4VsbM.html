on the hair I have right now it's just
kind of easy beachy kind of looking
waves you know just kind of the
effortless look like you really didn't
put a lot of time into it you're just
kind of left and wet
I've gotten a lot of compliments on this
hairstyle it's personally one of my
favorites for everyday use right now so
this is what we're getting just kind of
the waves curled a little bit in some
areas um it's just you know kind of all
over the place
keep in mind this is not supposed to be
a nicely curled tutorial it's just kind
of wavy Beach like hair I'm gonna show
you really quick the products I used um
first it's a hair dryer I just use a
Remington one that's probably gonna
wonder what it is just looks like this
guy from Target a few years ago who's
that
not really my favorite but hair dryer I
also use mice to do Flatiron this is
just a what is it 1 inch I do believe um
and I also used my bio tariff dry
shampoo which I absolutely love but
those are all the products I used in the
beginning of the video you'll see me
film from last night I have absolutely
no makeup on so prepares help um I don't
think I filmed it completely no makeup
and wet hair for it so I hope you guys
enjoy this video
umm I am excited to put up for you oh
and I will see you on the next one bye
you
okay so after you slept on them they've
dried bah-bah-bah this is what you
should get I know I look crazy
there's not really a time limit just
kind of wait until they are nice and dry
and ready to go so I'm just gonna take
these out
that's what you're getting
you
yeah so this is what you got after you
pull them out they're just like that
little crinkly kind of curls and now I'm
going to take my hair dryer I'm just
gonna you know do the top of my head
I'm also gonna take a round brush for my
bangs and blow-dry my bangs out because
I'm very picky about them and they have
to be the exact way that I want
you
now it's time to like straighten them
and stuff make them a little bit more
beachy especially on top I'm just gonna
kind of touch it up because since I suck
at writing and I only do like this side
of my head sometimes it gets really flat
on certain areas and so that's when you
just kind of take your straightener
turret kind of curly out and stuff like
that these are really more crimped than
I like so I'm also going to take my
straightener a little bit through them
just to kind of loosen them up and not
make them look so like I meant to do it
so and then you can kind of just like
curve your straightener you know make
little curls with them stuff like that
so you're just kind of getting like a
messy wave to your hair I'm gonna go
ahead and do my bangs I like to keep
these more on the straighter side
usually when I'm working throughout the
day I tuck them behind my ear so they
end up getting like a little flair to
them but it
so again do that time just kind of go
over them they'll go flat once you do
this just go over the pears and like see
this one looks crazy some of them look
crazy don't forget you can just totally
curl them like
you
there's another set that I like to do
personally and I'd like to put some dry
shampoo in my hair just cuz my hair gets
really oily throughout the day and it
really helps like for me I feel like my
roots get darker whenever I don't
blow-dry my hair so I like to kind of
just lighten them up with this because
it does make them a little bit lighter
so I'm just kind of putting it wherever
I feel like I'm gonna need it so good I
just through the top really and I'm
looking on the sides it looks a little
bit greasy right there
you
and of course with this look you also
have the option of using volumizing
powders and stuff like that um
personally I feel like this makes my
hair look pretty thick I guess so I
don't really use a volumizing powder so
I hope you guys enjoyed this hair
tutorial it's just super effortless and
really nice and easy to do it doesn't
require too much time so I hope you guys
enjoy it and I'll see you all in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
