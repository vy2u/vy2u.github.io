okay so the first thing we're going to
do is start off by priming our eyes with
a Paint Pot this is in soft ochre from
Mac I'm going to be using the Urban
Decay Naked palette today the original
and I'm going to take Dean color naked
and I'm just going to buff this into my
crease next I'm taking the color dark
horse with a shader brush and I'm just
going to apply this to the outer half of
my eye just to really add some nice
depth drive applied this I'm going to go
ahead with a clean blending brush and
I'm just going to blend this out really
nicely and then taking that same brush
I'm going to go in with buck I'm also
going to use this color to help blend
out that really dark shade that we just
put on the outer half of our lid
damn taking the Loreal shadow this is an
cocoa I think I'll put the exact name
below but I'm just going to put this in
the inner part of my eye and just also
help blend this into the darker color
that we applied earlier so you just then
I'm just going to take make it again and
make sure everything is nice and blended
out now I'm just gonna go on with my
brow bar to go using the darkest shade
and I'm going to fill in my eyebrows oh
where the bright big tire that day I'll
make the promises you felt till Mac I'll
be the man you'll never be and you won't
be around you see
now taking the naked basics palette I'm
going to use the color W OS and I'm
going to use this as my highlight I love
the shade it's just a really nice matte
color then going back in with dark horse
in a pencil brush I'm just going to
smudge this eye shadow all underneath my
lower lash line and just make sure it's
nice and blended out
you know
taking my mac 210 brush and this
Jourdain aligner I'm going to go ahead
and line my eyes I've been really loving
this eyeliner lately
ever since I've gotten it I've been
using it and it's a really really really
awesome liner
I wear the bright pink tire that day
I'll make the promises you fell to make
I'll be the man you'll never be and you
won't be taking my Mack pencil liner
this is in smolder I'm going to line my
waterline and also my upper waterline
and the lashes on be using today are the
our Dale natural whiskies I featured
these in my haul video I just posted the
other day so I'll link that down below
if you're interested but I am using the
duo lash glue in dark and please excuse
my right eye you can see a little bit of
the glue um where I didn't cover it with
liner very well I was more focused on my
left eye so yeah you can see a little
bit of the glue but I like the dark tone
a lot better than the clear lash glue
then I'm going to take my usual face
products my makeup forever matte velvet
+ and my Beauty Blender and I'm just
going to blend this out all over my face
and a lot of you've been asking about my
skin why it's so red it's just naturally
this red I mean I really don't have an
excuse for it or did not bring it back
and
just like when we were kids steal the
car and drive to me wah wah wah wah
now I'm going to take my mac prolongwear
concealer and in c20 and my Sigma brush
and I'm just going to apply this
underneath my eyes and blend it out jaw
you're myself lately gone back on
everything this
and taking that same Sigma brush and
also a powder brush from Sigma I'm going
to take my makeup forever super matte
loose powder and I'm just going to set
my under eye area and my face makeup
with this baby
I believe but you go out in need maybe
ride for tonight bring it back and visit
me
in my sleep just like today I'll be
using my benefit bronzer this is called
hoola and I'm going to use my Mac 109 to
contour my face this bronzer never lets
me down it's so good and blends out
amazingly so I definitely recommend it
if you're in the market for a high-end
bronzer
oh wait for you but not forever it's up
to you and all I'm doing here is just
touching up that dark horse color
underneath my eyes just to make sure
it's nice and smoked out away for you
I'm taking the Jordana best lash extreme
mascara and I'm just going to apply this
to my lashes to blend my real and
falsies together and I'm also gonna put
this on my lower lashes as well taking
the blush alpine bronze from Mac this
was limited edition but I can't get over
it absolutely love it I'm gonna go ahead
and apply this to my cheekbones just we
were kids to the car we tried to me wha

sisters from Stila and it's call
aspiring I'm just going to line my lips

nude if you don't want to new that's
