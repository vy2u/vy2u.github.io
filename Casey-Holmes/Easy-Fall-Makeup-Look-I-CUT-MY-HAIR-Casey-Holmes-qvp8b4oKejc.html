making an Instagram video like this
video was strictly for Instagram and
then I ended up really loving how it
looked and I was like how about I just
put this up on my tube because I wanted
you guys to see it I was kind of iffy
about put this on my YouTube because I
want to do a full review on this palette
because I'm using this new natasha de
Nonna palette and it's a lot of money
this is the shade I think Green Brown
this is the palette green Brown so this
is what it looks like
it is stunning there are other colors on
the market that you can go and get like
there's a lot of NYX eyeshadows that
look really beautiful and that you can
recreate this look with but I was
playing with this palette just for the
Instagram video and I'm not saying go
buy right now it's amazing I'm not
saying it's terrible because it's not it
was so easy to work with but I want to
do a few more looks and then come back
with a video sharing my thoughts with
you swatches a detailed review on that
palette letting you know if you should
try it out or not I do this for a living
I buy a lot of products you know and I
buy high-end stuff for a living you know
coz this is my job and reviewing stuff
for you guys but I haven't purchased
like one eyeshadow palette that was this
much so it was very like it was really
hard for me cuz I was like oh my god why
am i spending this much money on a
palette but like I said I'm not telling
you to go get it right now but I figured
I would share this tutorial with you
guys hopefully you like it and just know
that you can recreate this look with
different things that you might have at
your home I use my favorite foundation
of the moment concealer bronzer all of
that by the way before we get started
this is my first video I'm filming with
my shorter hair what you guys think
I didn't style it today I just slept on
it and woke up this morning put a little
bit dry shampoo in I didn't even brush
it just a hair is super healthy now it
just feels really good and we went a
little lighter around my face with
baleog so yeah let me know what you
think in the comments I know something
you're gonna be bummed but a lot of
you've been so sweet because snapchats
always the first to know everything
cause posting pictures on there and
people on Instagram are like how are you
seeing these photos you had to follow me
on snapchat to see a lot of things for
the first time so yeah I hope you guys
like it if you don't that's okay but I
like it and that's kind of what matters
cuz I gotta I gotta wear it do you want
to see how I style this how I put
extensions in and things like that then
totally let me know hope you like that I
do and I hope you like this makeup look
so I will quit rambling and let's just
get started
and I'll show you how to do this makeup
look so I've already primed my eyes of
my favorite eyeshadow primer by NARS and
I'm gonna go ahead and start with this
shade right here from the Natasha denote
a palette and it's a nice kind of pew
tone cream shade so I'm gonna apply this
all over the lid just to set that primer
and get our eyelids ready for some
shadow feel like you say the same thing
every time but you never know now I'm
digging this shade right here which is a
beautiful mid-tone shade I don't even
know how to describe it like a peachy
Brown the more peachy read I don't know
it's beautiful though I love it there's
a transition shade in this palette as
well as highlight shades there are some
mats there are some shimmers I
appreciate that and right when I looked
at the palette I knew I was going to
like that part of it so I'm going in
with this blue-green color right here
and I'm going to take a blending brush
and I'm going right below the shade we
just put on and I'm going to go into the
crease into the outer V and also a
little bit in the inner corner on the
lid so I'm going to leave a little bit
of skin on the ball of my eye but I'm
going to put this green all over or
you're seeing it right now just because
when we put our dark green on I want
there to be a lighter green to kind of
fade up and have a gradient effect
towards that transition shade that we
had just put on in the very beginning so
I'm doing the same exact thing to the
other eye this is a really pretty color
very very pigmented I like it a lot I
think it looks absolutely stunning then
I'm going to take my next favorite shade
which is this gorgeous sparkly
four-screen I'm going to take a dense
brush and I'm going to pack this on the
outer corners of my eye take it into the
crease again below that green that we
had just put on and also put it in the
inner corner of the eye and this is just
going to deepen it up and then when we
put the center shade on it's really just
going to pop so again I am taking it
into the crease just so everything
blends really nicely and I'm doing the
same exact thing on the other eye and
the Mac brush that I like to use for
this I will link it down below it's my
favorite brush to pack on color with
it's literally the
I don't use anything else for a really
shimmery look or anything like that so
after that I'm going to go in and blend
out the edges I started with the morphe
brush but then I went in with the
blending brush and a little bit of the
first shade we used well the second
shade and I just blended out the edges
of that just so it blended nicely up to
that transition color taking this color
right here it is so beautiful this is a
gorgeous sparkly like champagne green
color if that makes any sense it is
gorgeous it has a hint of green to it
and it is so pretty with the rest of
these eyeshadows so I'm going to pop
this in the center of my lid again using
that same brush I was going to use a
glitter glue but I didn't and you guys
this stayed on so well it just looks so
beautiful I think with a glitter glue
it'll be even better then I line my
upper lash line with a liquid liner put
on my flutter lashes and Shayla and then
I'm priming my face with my cane in
Austin and mattifying primer I'll have
all these products linked down below so
if I go too quickly they'll be down
there for you so don't worry then I'm
taking my Smashbox Studios skin
foundation I've been loving this lately
I just think it looks so beautiful on
the skin and I'm going to blend it all
over my face and I'm going to use a
Smashbox Studios skin waterproof
concealer to highlight and to conceal my
dark circles I say that in a weird way
like dark circles
so there's my current foundation routine
I hope you like it now I'm going to take
the flower PD translucent powder you
guys I love this well it's not
translucent it's in the shade lo1 and
i'm going to set that and they were
going to move on to brows for brows I
didn't spend a lot of time on it because
I've shown you guys so many times but I
did use my benefit cut brow and number
three and then to set it I did use 3d
brow tones from benefit as well this
gave some highlights to the brows you
can see my brows are getting more sparse
at least this one because I keep
freaking picking at it
so I just it away my baking and our
bronzing I just love this bronzer from
Neutrogena you guys it cannot get away
from it it's just so warm and gorgeous
as you can see it just looks beautiful
on the skin and it blends out so well I
can't say enough good things about it
and I'm using this expensive ask Tom
Ford brush I mentioned this in my
expensive as luxury makeup all so if you
want to check that out I will leave it
down below
Greg brush I love it to put on bronzer
then I'm taking this butter LONDON
bronzer clutch and taking in more ashy
tone and contouring my face
after that moving on to this Marc Jacobs
blush and lines in last night
and I mean the name is like whatever but
I do like the color so I'm applying it
to my cheeks and I'm just going to blend
it out with this little japonesque brush
next up I'm trying out this Natasha the
Nonna glow this is a highlighter in the
shade light and this is a great
highlighter if you want something to
wear every single day you know something
that's not too intense too glittery you
know like very night out ish this is a
perfect daytime highlight I think it's
beautiful cuz you're just such a
gorgeous glow so I highly recommend it
for my day to day highlight girls then I
went into this lighter shade and I was
like oh my god
oh my god is so bright so it's super
super pigmented but very easy to blend
out and I really love the shade I think
it is absolutely beautiful it's a little
less glittery than the ones that we have
on our eyelids is more of a shimmer but
it is absolutely stunning taking this
before waterproof eyeliner I just lined
my lower waterline and then I'm going in
with that dark green and I'm going to
press this up against that lower lash
line I know this angle is not the best
I'm sorry I just have to like look down
when I'm doing this um but just press it
right up against that lower lash line I
got I like to get a little smoky with
mine so I dragged it down a little bit
but then I'm going to take this shade
right here and I'm going to blend it out
with this Mac pencil brush why am I
having a hard time talking but this Mac
pencil brush is amazing by far my
favorite one ever
I mean it's pricey but it's worth the
price I just I can't find another pencil
brush that I love more so after that
you're just going to apply some mascara
to your lower lashes just to balance out
the thick and intense the falsies we've
got going on top then for lip liner I'm
taking this Palladio lip liner in ginger
I love it from the drugstore
honestly I've mentioned this so many
times because it's a great formula great
color I love it taking this Laura
chlo-chlo lorac pro liquid lipstick
comes out September 19th you guys I keep
reminding you but just so you know it's
coming out then I'm going to top this
onto my lips and then you are completely
done with the look so I hope you enjoyed
it let me know in the comments if you do
want to see it
real or like a review on this palette I
would love to do that for you thank you
so much for watching it don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and I will see you
