on this makeup look right here it's
really simple and really festive for
Christmas Day and it's great for if you
don't want to like spend too much time
on your makeup but you still want to
look presentable and take a lot of
selfies so I hope you guys enjoyed this
makeup look it was really easy to do and
I'm sure you have something similar at
your house so if you do like this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel and also if you
guys didn't know I am doing vlogmas on
my second channel where blog everyday
till Christmas and I will probably
continue blogging after vlogmas so if
you guys haven't checked out my second
channel I will leave a link down below
as well let me know in the comments what
you guys are doing for Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day I would love to hear it
and yeah thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you enjoy this and let's
get started with the makeup tutorial are
you naughty or nice that's act that
should be the comment that should be
what's in the comments that's what my
sweatshirt says so let me know in the
comments were you naughty or nice this
year probably very naughty okay so I'm
sorry if this voiceover sounds weird but
my microphone is acting up so I don't
know what's wrong with it but I'm gonna
prime my eyes and apply the makeup geek
baby face shadow all over my lid and
this is just going to even out the skin
tone and create a nice space for the
shadow we're gonna put on next and for
shadow I'm gonna use this bronzer by
Laura Mercier and I'm gonna put that
into the crease I didn't want my lid to
be too bare so I wanted a little
something in there that is really easy
to do so I just put this into the crease
and then I also did apply babyface one
more time on the lid just to make sure
it was nice and bright then I'm going to
apply this Urban Decay heavy metal
glitter eyeliner and these are amazing
they're so pigmented you don't have to
apply multiple coats of them at all and
I like these better than the mixed ones
the next ones are good affordable dupes
but the next ones do tend to burn my
eyes and I don't have that issue with
these so I highly highly recommend these
Urban Decay glitter liners they're
really great
and then I'm going to curl my lashes and
apply liner to my upper and waterline
and then I'm going to apply my benefit
they're real primer and this is amazing
because it is a brown most primers are
usually white and sometimes they show
through your mascara when you put it on
after but this doesn't do that though it
looks really great by itself and it
looks like your natural lashes but once
you put your other mascara on top it
adds so much volume so much length I
really loved it I had this on in the
blog actually and I had so many people
ask me about it so this is the combo
I've been using lately and Sephora is
letting you guys have the ability to get
your hands on the sample of this primer
before anyone else so I do have a
personal code with them I will leave it
down below and you can get it with any
purchase on Sephora calm so I hope you
guys try it out it's just a free sample
if you buy anything on Sephora and who
doesn't love samples I mean it like
let's be real after that I'm going to go
ahead and apply my primers I'm using my
regular Smashbox primers and then I'm
going to apply my foundation which is
the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
and then moving on I'm gonna apply my
concealer I know this foundation looks
crazy but after concealer and everything
it looks good I promise
so I'm gonna apply that underneath my
eyes and just blend it out and also in
the center of my face and then I began
to look normal again
then I'm going to apply a little bit of
benefits hoola I'm not gonna bronze
since my foundation is pretty bronze
itself so I just added a little bit of
contour with this fluffy brush from
morphe and then I'm applying my favorite
blush right now that I can't get away
from by Sigma it's just so beautiful I
love it's my perfect color and then I am
gonna apply highlighter I'm just
applying effect as opal I'd love this
highlighter I think it is so beautiful
and I'm gonna do my brows and then after
that I'm gonna go in with this envy eye
liner from Laura Mercier you can use any
green eye liner that you want and I'm
gonna put this on my lower waterline and
this just really makes the eyes pop I
think this makeup look is so fun because
you have the silver red and green and it
doesn't look too overdone it just looks
really festive and fun but it's subtle
at the same time so I thought that was
great
and then I'm gonna take bad blood by
Urban Decay and put this all over and
then for lipstick I'm using this one by
NYX I can't remember exactly what it's
called but I will leave it down below
and then you are officially done with
this look it's really simple really easy
but super festive and fun for the
daytime so I really hope you guys
enjoyed it thank you so much for
watching and I will see you all in my
next video bye
hello let's get started with this do you
like the makeup look
