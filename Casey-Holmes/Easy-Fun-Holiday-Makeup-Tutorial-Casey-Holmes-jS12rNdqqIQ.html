a makeup tutorial on this look it's
really fun of course
I incorporated glitter because it is the
holiday season and I had to put a red
lip in this I feel like a winged liner
and red lip is just a classic for
Christmas time and then having like a
warm face I just think it's really
classic and it's just something that
never goes out of style every single
year but this year I really wanted to
include like a glitter wing on top of my
black liner and include glitter right
here if you didn't want to go as
dramatic as I did with the lower lash
line putting glitter here you can always
just skip that step and put like black
underneath here you could either like
smoke it out if you wanted to still have
it dramatic or you could just do a
little bit of black just to make sure
you balance out the top because having
the glare out top does make it a little
bit more dramatic so you want to make
sure you kind of balance everything out
and don't leave this Emmys here naked so
yeah that is this tutorial I really hope
you guys enjoy it I love it and it is so
fun great for Christmas time and I
quickly want to show you guys this shirt
because I think it's hilarious and I
just got it off of the hunt and it says
where's my Santa ho ha I think it's so
funny I love like funny Christmas shirts
and sweaters I had one last year else
and Merry Christmas you filthy animal
which I thought was just hilarious
I just love things like this and when I
was on the hunt I saw it and I was like
just me do in my life
if you guys don't know the hunt is
basically an app where you can take
pictures of people with outfits or get
them offline post them to the app and
people will help you find those on items
online if they don't have like a direct
link or something so I found this one on
the explore page that's where you always
find me is on the explore page just
hanging out looking at what people find
and then that's how I just found this
one and I love it and if I can find the
link to I will leave it down below for
you guys so if you guys want to see
another holiday look for me like this
video and let me know down in the
comments what you like to see is there
like a darker lip if you want to see a
really smokey eye let me know your
thoughts I'm open to anything because I
love hearing your suggestions so yeah
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed this video and
go ahead and get started nice to meet
you okay
first important step is obviously
priming your eyes I'm gonna leave my
favorite primers down below that I'd
love to use and like how to keep my cup
is I love it now I'm gonna be taking
tape and I'm going to be putting this on
my eyes today and a lot of people ask me
how I do this basically I just line it
up with my lower lash line and kind of
angle it up towards the end of my brow
so just follow that lower lash line and
you'll have the perfect winged liner in
the perfect shape at the end of the
eyeshadow now I'm going to take white
and cream and mix them together from the
first law Pro palette and I'm gonna put
this all over my lid this will just
create a nice base for the rest of the
makeup we're gonna put on later guys go
ahead for the weekend then I'm gonna
take the color taupe and I'm just going
to be blending this into my crease and
then we're gonna go back in with a
smaller blending brush and put this a
little bit more precisely into the
crease so it kind of gives more of a cut
crease look I've been really digging the
cut crease look I think it really just
helps with my eye shape and really opens
up the eyes so I definitely wanted to do
that today and I want to make sure I did
something simple since the main focus is
on the liner then it's time to take my
gel liner from BH Cosmetics now keep in
mind since you do have this tape you can
use it as a guideline for your winged
liner so if you're having trouble you
know getting a nice wing at the end you
can use the tape as a guideline
also I meant to mention earlier that you
want to put a tape on the back of your
hand and just loosen up the glue before
you put it on your eyes just so you
don't tug at the skin as much and see
after you put your liner on you can take
off the tape and rub I own a nice clean
sharp line so you want to just go ahead
and do this to the other side and don't
worry if it's not perfect because we are
gonna put glitter right on top so I'm
going to taking these two products I'll
leave them down below but this mixing
liquid right here is just a better way
to apply the glitter and it really keeps
it in place I'm highly impressed by this
stuff I actually got an eye mats this
past April if you love glitter and you
want to try like glitter liner I
definitely recommend this product cuz it
makes it so easy are you gonna want to
do is just dip it into that liquid and
then into the politican
now it is gonna take a couple times to
kind of get it nice and opaque but once
you get there there's no going back and
don't worry if it gets all over your
black liner you can just go back in and
touch it up with your gel liner again
then I'm gonna take my NARS liner and
just line my upper waterline and then
apply mascara and of course I applied my
velour lashes in girl you crazy witch
I've shown you guys so many times and
then I'm taking my favorite too primer
from Smashbox and then my Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation and I'm just
going to go ahead and apply these to my
face you guys to see me do this multiple
times but I don't know I just don't like
leaving a face routine out of a makeup
tutorial I feel like it kind of defeats
the purpose just in case somebody hasn't
seen my videos before so then I'm gonna
take my Mac Pro Longwear concealer put
it underneath my eyes the center of my
face and then of course put the NARS one
on my nose there's just something about
that NARS concealer and I love using it
on the bridge of my nose to highlight I
don't know why I didn't show this
product but I used the Augusta's de
banana powder just to set everything in
place and then for bronzer we're taking
this Smashbox a photo mat oh no wait
what's a call suntan matte bronzer and
I'm gonna just for this on the tops of
the forehead cheekbones and in the neck
and jaw line
then going to another product I've kind
of fallen back in love with this is the
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I've
been loving this to contour it's just so
nice I forgot how nice it was so this is
a new packaging I had to throw my old
one away because it expired but I love
this bronzer it's really easy to work
with and if you get some in your mouth
it actually tastes really good then I'm
taking luster by NARS and I'm just gonna
go ahead and apply this to my cheeks it
just adds a nice a warmth to this look
anytime someone named Luna film all
around you in order to describe you
little baby
and then the highlight I'm gonna be
using my Becca highlighter in moonstone
which is one of my faves I've had this
for a while now and it's just so
beautiful then I'm gonna fill in my
brows with this Mac fluidline and then
we're going to go ahead and move on to
the rest of the eyes so I'm gonna take
sable and I'm just going to apply this
right in the outer part of the eye
directly into the crease with a pencil
brush so I'm just gonna focus it all on
the outer half and then fade it in to
the rest of the crease and then I'm
gonna take the color white and just
highlight with that adds a really nice
highlight I like that color
and then I'm gonna line my waterline
with the black liner and then moving on
to the lower lash line I'm gonna take
the black and an angle brush I'm going
to really smoke this out and you don't
want to go in more than halfway and then
you're gonna want to go in with taupe
and just blend this out so it's nice and
smoky and I love the way that this
turned out because it really just makes
your eyes look and just I love it
I always sing just smile then you just
want to take that glitter and do the
same thing with the kind of mixing
medium we used you just want to put this
in the inner part of the lower lash line
and then you just want to blend it into
the black so it fades really nicely
you just want to put some mascara on the
bottom lashes which I focused most of
this product on the outer half since
that's where I wanted the most darkness
at but I just put a tiny bit where the
glitter is moving on the lips i'm taking
this nyx lip pencil in deep red i'm just
going to line my lips and then i'm
taking the most difficult a lipstick of
a life to put on which is max Ruby whoo
it's a clerk it's a Christmas classic
obviously but man this stuff is so hard
to put on it's really really really
really matte but once you get it on it's
beautiful just kind of warm up the color
a little bit and you should be good to
go and then I'm just going to touch up
the lines with the lip pencil and you
are done so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this look if you end up
recreating it don't forget to tag me and
send me your photos I hope you guys are
having an amazing holiday season so far
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
