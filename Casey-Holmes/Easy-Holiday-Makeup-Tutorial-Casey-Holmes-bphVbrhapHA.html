because I'm currently developing a
self-tan so that's why I'm not matching
very well myself tan is getting darker
and my face is staying the same so I'm
like hold on oh yeah I'm wearing a PJs
shirt hope you don't mind but a lot of
you asked for this makeup tutorial in my
last video one of my last videos it was
the Sephora vib sale recommendations a
lot of you really love this look I love
this look it's using one of my favorite
palettes which is a Smashbox
shapematters palette and yeah I just
wanted to film this for you guys because
I really love it I love the way that it
turned out it's really easy it's a
classic low key fuse for the holidays
something really smoky sexy then again
you can use a year round but if you pop
over a lip on and have this makeup look
actually it's like a holiday on your
face so weird so feel free to change up
the color I just did a nude one because
this is the one that I did in my last
video that you guys saw this in so I
just want to stick with what I had on in
that video and I really quickly want to
let you guys know that I had the awesome
opportunity to work with Sephora and
create a video for them on their website
which is um insane because I'm on
Sephora all the time I have been for
years and I'm like that's my face
so I was able to talk about one of my
favorite new products lately and like
give you all the details about it and
it's the origins original skin serum I'm
so excited to have that video up on
their side because I've been using it
for such a long time haven't been able
to tell you guys about it yet but it's
finally up there and I'm just so excited
it's been a part of my nighttime routine
for a couple months now it's been a
while it's been a while since I filmed
that video so I'm really excited I love
this product and I can't wait for you
guys to check it out so if you want to
see my video on Sephora there's a link
to it in the description box below you
can click it and go check it out I just
think it's so cool that out there will
work with the fara I'll never get over
it I'll never get over it thank you guys
so much I really hope you enjoyed this
video again thank you for the love on
that last video where I had this makeup
look so one of my favorites feel free to
share it and don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you liked this video and
subscribe to check out
more videos of mine and again sorry for
the casual attire so if you want to see
how to get this makeup look then let's
just go ahead and get started okay so
starting off with a clean face I'm going
to go ahead and just put some tape on
the outer corners because this helps my
eyeshadow so much it just makes it show
show really so nice and sharp and it's
just a lifesaver
so I'm going to take the lightest
vanilla shade in the palette I'm gonna
put this all over my lid this is just
gonna give us a nice base for all the
rest of the colors and help everything
blend it really easily
then I'm gonna take this bronzer right
here it's just a nice warm brown and I'm
gonna put this into the crease with this
bareMinerals brush I'm obsessed with
this brush it is so good I've just been
trying all the brushes they sent me and
like as I go on I find little ones that
I just love then this crease brush is
phenomenal so definitely check it out if
you're wanting to splurge on a crease
brush then I'm going to take this darker
Brown and I'm going to put this in the
outer corner and I'm not going to go
further than halfway in and I am going
to build this color up I want it to be
dark but I'm going to also put a black
on so it doesn't have to be too intense
this just adds a lot of depth in the
look and it really helps the black and a
lighter color we're going to put on the
lid blend together so again don't take
this further than halfway and you just
want to focus this on the outer corner
and you just want to go this up to a
medium brown shade this is a really dark
brown so just be careful light hands
work best and then I'm going to take
this black and use a pencil brush so I
can precisely put this in the outer
corner and I'm just going to do like a
little triangle shape I'm not going to
go further than I did with that Brown
I'm just going to keep it right there on
the outer V and this adds so much depth
and it just really amps up the look so I
highly recommend doing this because it
makes such a difference
but then I'm going to take that brush
again we use with the brown and just
blend this out this has no additional
product on it I'm just using the brush
that we use and blending everything out
this is all about blending and I did
this a couple times to really make sure
I got the color I wanted and the depth I
wanted as well then I'm going out that
medium brown shade and once again
putting this into the crease and this is
just going to blend everything out once
again and then we're going in with this
a gorgeous shade right here and this is
what we're gonna use all over the lid
you put this all the way from the inner
corner in all the way to that Brown that
we put on don't be afraid to go a little
bit over the brown because we are going
to blend it out seamlessly so it's okay
if you do it doesn't have to be perfect
so I'm taking it a little bit over that
halfway mark into that Brown and just
really putting this all over the entire
lid this color is so beautiful it's so
pigmented
I just am obsessed with it and then I'm
going to take that brush once again with
no product on it and blend out the edges
of that lighter shade that we put on
just so everything kind of flows
together then I'm going back in with
that black and I'm going to touch it up
because I do want this to be a pretty
deep look so I want to make sure the
outer corners are really nice and deep
so going back in with that black and
then I'm going to blend out once again
with that brown color I did put some
color on this brush just to help blend
out that black and then we're all set to
move on to the next part which is liquid
liner I love a winged liner and this
makeup forever liner I'm using it for a
while now it's so good so this is what
I'm using to create that winged liner it
just creates a nice sharp line
and I feel like a winged liner just
really goes with this look really well
you don't have to do it but I love me a
winged liner so I did that today then
I'm gonna put on lashes actually put on
a Koko lashes and goddess not the ones I
showed you guys I changed my mind and
I'm glad I did and I'm using the two
Smashbox primers that I love and then
the coverfx drops with this bareMinerals
brush PSA announcement I know this looks
really crazy right now don't freak out
in the comments it's okay
we saw how it looks in the beginning
right I looked right I looked normal
I know this color is very scary at first
I was super scared at first but once I
blended it into my skin really really
well and added concealer everything was
fine in my makeup world so don't worry
it is a little bit lighter than my chest
because my chest is developing a
self-tan so don't mind that but you know
what it's okay this turned out really
nicely I like it so I'm going to take
the Urban Decay Naked skin I've been
using this underneath my eyes lately and
I'm going to blend it out with this
Tarte brush that I got in a set that I
recently showed you guys and I just love
this brush to blend out concealer it's
been my new favorite right now and this
Urban Decay concealer has been my
favorite underneath my eyes - I just
think it looks really gorgeous
especially with this cover FX foundation
I think the combo is amazing then I'm
going to take that Smashbox palette use
a banana shade in it to set all of that
concealer that I just put on so
underneath my eyes and very daring now
and in the center of my face then I'm
gonna take a bronzer with this Tarte
bamboo brush and I'm going to put this
on the tops of my forehead to make it
look a little bit smaller and then also
on my cheeks as well then I'm gonna take
the a sheer tone in here and I'm gonna
use it to contour I am using a makeup
geek brush I have been reaching for this
a lot more than my NARS eita brush so
I'm just saying that's an amazing brush
I'll leave a link for it down below in a
coupon code you guys want to check it
out then I'm going to take this gorgeous
NARS Steven Klein palette with that
blush it just showed you guys and put
this on my cheeks this color is
beautiful I love it so much and I'm
gonna blend it out with a duo fiber
brush to make sure it's not too harsh
then I'm gonna take the glow shade in
the Smashbox palette I'm going to use
this as my highlighter this hilar is
absolutely amazing guys I know I said in
my last video but some highlighters and
palettes just really suck but this one
is phenomenal phenomenal
but um like I love it sa phenomenal
enough I'm trying to come up with other
words to use other than obsessed you
know so then I filled in my brows and
I'm gonna take that glow shade one more
time and put this underneath my brows to
highlight and this looked so pretty oh
my gosh if you saw it in person you'd be
like yes I love it so I'm going to take
that black with a flat definer brush
from Sigma and I'm gonna piss just I'm
gonna push this underneath my lower
lashes this is going to really smoke
this out this black is so intense and
pigmented but it blends really really
well so it's perfect to use underneath
that lower lash line then I'm going to
take that darker Brown once again and
take a pencil brush the ones by Mac are
my absolute favorite I feel like they
blend out everything just beautifully
and I'm going to blend out that black
I'm not going to drag it down too much
but I'm gonna drag it down just a little
bit to blend it out really nicely so it
doesn't look too harsh underneath the
eyes and then I am gonna put mascara on
my bottom lashes I use this NARS
audacious mascara I don't know I got it
in a set from them and I am obsessed
with this mascara oh my gosh it's so
black can you tell it's still black I
love it I'm gonna take this Halle do lip
liner I know you guys tell me how to say
all the time - I totally forget I'll
have the name of it in the description
box below then I'm gonna take this e got
a WoW can't pronounce any of these and
this is in soon I'm gonna put this on my
lips first I really love this color
again you can switch out this lip color
for a red and make it great and make
just a great look for a holiday party
then I'm going to take this buxom lip
foundation and nude and I'm putting this
directly in the center of my lips just
to add a little bit more dimension to
the lips and to this look as well and
