a prom up do a hair tutorial it is a
super easy look to recreate and I like
the way that it turned down because it's
it's definitely a updo but it's a little
bit more on the casual side it's not
structured or really put together if you
have a dress that has a go really
gorgeous neckline or if you have some
statement jewelry that you want to wear
this would be a great hairstyle to do
because it will really show everything
up and get your hair up and out of your
face so ever I can see your gorgeous
face and not have it covered by all of
your hair all you're going to need is a
bobby pins a hair tie a curling iron
which I will explain in the video and
then I use different products like a dry
shampoo because I'm running on second
day hair so I would recommend you know a
dry shampoo or something to kind of get
the oils and this is also great at
adding a little bit more texture into
your hair and then I did use a thermal
spray and of course some hairspray
because you want to stay all night long
we just have some twists going on right
here and then we have a nice kind of
messy bun here in the back so it's
really easy to achieve so I just wanted
to do a video for my girls that they
want to go out and spend a ton of money
on getting their hair done and I think
this is a really cute way to do your
hair and also if you want me to do a
half a pack down hair tutorial then let
me know by liking this video and I will
get that up for you guys as soon as
possible because I know
prom is approaching for a ton of people
I saw some girls actually getting ready
for prom this past weekend so it's
coming super fast and like I said if you
want to see it then just like this video
and I'll leave all the problem videos
I've done so far down below in the
description box I have two makeup
tutorials and one of those makeup
tutorials also has a hair tutorial and
so thank you so much for watching and if
you want to see how I got this hairstyle
then just keep watching okay so before
the video already sprayed my dry shampoo
into my hair and now I'm just going to
go ahead and brush it out moving on to
heat protectant I'm using this one from
Rusk I like it because this also gives
your hair some texture as well it's not
like silky smooth or anything like
that today I'll be using the nume
lustrum set and they love this curling
wand set it comes with five different
ones and the base as well so it's really
convenient and you basically have every
one that you will ever need in one kit
so I love it you guys know I've used
nume for almost three years now it's my
favorite brand for curling irons it's
what I use in all my videos so of course
there's nothing different I'm using it
today I'm using the 25 millimeter wands
and I find that my hair really stays put
all night long with this I can go like
two or three days without curling my
hair again so love this wand is perfect
I have a discount code for you guys down
below if you're interested but all your
curls are just going to be away from
your face no particular pattern I'm just
kind of messily doing this
and then I'm going in and messing up
these curls you want to make sure you
loosen them up and get them ready for
the hairstyle we're about to do also
meant to show you guys that you needed a
comb as well so first off I'm going to
take a section right in front of my face
nothing too thick I'm just taking it
about this wide I'm going to be twisting
it and Bobby pinning it just so that it
stays in place and doesn't get confused
with the rest of the hair I'm then again
going to do this with some more hair
right behind that piece this is going to
be a thicker section so it's about two
two and a half inches wide I would say
and this is going to be what we're going
to create our twist with so again this
is the amount that I have and I'm just
going to twist that again and bobby pin
it so it stays in place and then all
you're going to do is do the same
process to the other side
okay after you've got your sections
we're going to go ahead and start
teasing the back of our head just a
little bit I'm not teasing to give me
like a ton of volume or anything I'm
just using it to add some more texture
so when I do put it in a little pouf it
doesn't start sliding everywhere because
sometimes when you have silky hair when
you put it in a pouf sometimes it just
starts sliding around
so teasing is going to help prevent that
so now what I'm doing is I'm just
gathering all my hair with that little
pouf and I'm going to just pump it up a
little bit and bobby pin it in place I
use about four bobby pins just to make
sure that it stays in place all night
long so this is how big it should be
it's nothing too crazy just something to
add a little bit more volume next up
we're going to take the rest of the hair
that is not in the front of our face and
we are going to do the messy bun so I'm
going to go ahead and gather all in the
back like I'm going to do a ponytail and
I'll be taking my hair tie and just
messily putting this into a bun it's
just one of those things where you just
have to kind of overlap your hair and
eventually the bun will come together
and all the extra pieces you see hanging
out we will fix those later but moving
on to the twist I'm going to start
twisting from the top all the way down
to my ear and you're also going to want
to twist this strand all the way down as
much as you can because we are going to
put this around our bun and pin it in
place so you cannot see it
then after you've pinned it you just
want to kind of pull it and loosen it up
just a little bit so it's not too tight
to your head then we're going to go
ahead and take the first part down and
then work on the other side as well and
you're just going to do the same exact
process just start from the top and work
your way down to your ear while twisting
and adding more hair and we are also
going to wrap this around the bun and
pin it as well
now I'm going to be taking my bangs and
pinning them back and I really like the
pinned back bangs look especially for
prom it just looks really sleek and
elegant so I'm just going to pin this
right underneath where I pinned that
little twist and then pin the rest of
the hair right into the bun and you can
see right here it just creates a nice
kind of sleek look just play with it
kind of poof it up a little bit whatever
you want to do and then again we're
doing the same exact thing on the other
side
after that it's time to kind of inspect
everything I recommend doing this as you
go along just so you know what you're
working with and any areas that you need
to fix so now we're going to do is pin
all the longer pieces that we have in
the messy bun to our hair and it's okay
it doesn't matter how you do this it's a
messy bun so you really can't mess it up
after you're done this is what it should
look like just really nice and messy and
then you can just tug on everything
loosen everything up and then finish off
with some hairspray and you are done so
I hope you all enjoyed this really easy
hair tutorial for prom or a really nice
dinner whatever you want to use it for I
hope you guys enjoyed it and thank you
so much for watching I will see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
