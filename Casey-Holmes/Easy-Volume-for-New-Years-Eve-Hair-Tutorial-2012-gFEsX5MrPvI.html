part two of my New Year's Eve look this
is the hair portion I just did the eye
portion yesterday so if you're
interested in seeing that I will put the
link right down below where you can go
ahead and click that that's how I did
this I look but um for the hair I just
decided to do something voluminous and
not too curly I actually like this look
a lot I like it a lot more than just
like really tight curls for New Year's
so that's why I decided to do this and I
got a new curling iron so I've been
trying it out this is the look that I've
been creating a lot for the past couple
days and I've had a bunch of you like in
my last video asked me to do a tutorial
on that hair which this is the same
exact thing so I'm gonna show you what I
use is this Hot Tools curling iron I got
mine from Ulta for like $30 on sale and
it came with an awesome gift with
purchase so I would definitely check out
all tech and I really like it it's like
the only clamp one I really love but I'm
sure you can use the Conner ones or
something like that but I really like
this one and then you're also going to
need these suave touchable finish
hairspray but any kind of hairspray you
want to use if you don't want to use
hairspray then don't use it but I just
did because it's New Year's you're gonna
want your hair to last pretty much all
night long next thing is this nexus pro
man heat protectant you're definitely
gonna want to use a heat protectant
because we're gonna be using some heat
so I'm just using the one from Nexus and
then the last thing you're gonna need is
bobby pins I just got this little Conair
bobby pin set thing from CVS for I think
like 3 bucks so I would definitely
recommend picking that up pretty pretty
nifty so if you guys want to see how I
got this hair then just keep watching ok
so the first thing we're going to do is
just brush out our hair and make sure we
don't have any tangles going on then I'm
going to spray my heat protectant which
is the Nexus 1 I showed you in the
beginning of the video and I'm just
gonna spray this all throughout my hair
and brush it out just so it's evenly
distributed
now I'm just going section my hair in
two parts and I'm just gonna put this
one part on the top of my head then I'm
going to take the bottom section and
split it into two and again just brush
it out and get rid of the tangles
now I'm taking sections about one to two
or one and a half to two inches thanks
they're pretty thick and I'm gonna use
this curling iron and I'm just going to
curl all my curls away from my face if
you don't know how to curl your hair
with a clamp all you do is you start
from the middle and kind of twist your
hair to the barrel so you just want to
open the clamp twirl open the clamp
twirl and it's just distributes the heat
very evenly and it's probably the best
way to curl your hair with a curling
iron that has a clamp then I'm just
gonna take my hair and roll it up just
kind of following the curl and I'm just
going to pin this to my head kind of
like you have an invisible roller I
didn't have any rollers so this is what
I do so I'm just gonna pin it I pin it
with two bobby pins and it stays in
place nicely for me
so again I'm just gonna take a nice
thick section and I'm going to curl it
with the curling irons just going to
clamp down in the middle twist it open
the clamp twist it open the clamp and
you wanna do this until the hair the
ends are completely in the curling iron
we don't like the little clamp lines in
the hair that just doesn't look cute and
also you want to kind of hold this for
about 10 to 15 seconds however long your
hair needs it and then again just take
it out and follow the curl up to the
scalp then just kind of roll it like you
would like you would roll it if that
there was a Velcro roller there and then
you just pin it to your head so I'm
going to take continue to do this one
more time and just show you and then I
will come back when I've done most of my
hair
thank so now we're just gonna spray it
with some suave hairspray like I showed
you in the beginning and I'm just
lightly misting these I'm not a huge fan
of hairspray I just want a little bit
and I'm gonna go ahead this is what
should look like and I went ahead and do
the rest of my hair and I left my bangs
out this is the last section I'm gonna
do like this and you'll see me just curl
it and again pin it up
now I'm really really picky about my
bangs so I am just gonna leave these out
for now so now I'm just gonna wait about
ten minutes just to let the curls cool
off so do whatever you want to do I'm
just gonna sit here and try to look nice
like George Washington so I waited my 10
minutes and now I'm gonna take all of
these wonderful annoying the bobby pins
out of my hair
all right so this is what it should
start to look like just really big loose
legs again remember this is not going to
be a super curly hair tutorial it's just
more about volume and having really big
ways so now I'm just gonna take my bangs
brush through them and I'm gonna
actually just wrap them around the
curling iron I don't like them to be
super curly I just like them to kind of
have a little bit of wave to them now
I'm going to take my brush and I'm just
going to brush out all of my curls just
to get that really loose wave effect and
it creates a lot of volume so you just
want to kind of play with it you can
totally touch up any areas you need to
touch up I touched it up quite a few
places if that were just a little too
straight kind of like this one you just
want to do the same technique and that's
about it you just don't have to pin it
up afterwards and so I'm just brushing
out for the last time it's all about
playing with it and making it the way
you want it to look so this is how I
like it

outro and I will see you next time
