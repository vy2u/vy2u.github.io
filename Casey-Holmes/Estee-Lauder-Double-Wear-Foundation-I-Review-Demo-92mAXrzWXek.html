bringing you a quick review and demo on
a new foundation that I've been loving
lately just so I don't drag on this
video forever I will have a side panel
per usual and yeah let's just get
started so this is going to be on the
Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation the
color I am in is three w1 I could go up
a shade whenever I'm nice and self tan
just because this is a little light for
me but I love it it comes in a little
frosted glass the only fault I have
about this foundation is that there is
not a pump but the foundation is so good
that I don't even care about the pump it
is so full coverage you guys to me it
reminds me of the Kat Von D foundation
it just doesn't look as cakey it looks
so beautiful on the skin it doesn't make
your pores look big at all and I am just
obsessed with it it's just so good at
covering pretty much everything it has
not broken me out and I do have pretty
sensitive skin I think it would be great
for girls with combo oily skin girls
with oily skin and if you have dry skin
I would put on you know good moisturizer
if you wanted to try this out or just go
get a sample and see how it works with
your skin I wore to a Christmas party
the other day I put it on at 9 in the
morning and I didn't take it off till
9:00 at night and I did not touch up
with powder at all throughout the day
like literally I didn't touch my face
with powder or blotting sheets nothing
though that is saying something for this
foundation it lasts so well I'm so
obsessed with it I'm happy you guys let
me know about this because now I'm just
like all about this one and I do like to
use mine with the f80 from Sigma I feel
like it just blends it into the skin
really nicely then it's been like my
favorite brush lately for foundation I
do love the Kat Von D one though it has
amazing coverage but like I stated in my
last review on that foundation you can
tell you have foundation on it's like
very noticeable but this one I mean it
looks like you have foundation on but it
looks beautiful it doesn't look cakey it
looks smooth and it just looks gorgeous
so honestly there's not much more I can
say about the foundation other than I
love it I have no complaints about it it
lasts for so long hope you guys enjoyed
this video please give it a thumbs up if
you did and let me know in the comments
down below if you've tried this
foundation and what you think of it
because so far I've heard nothing but
positive reviews about it so thank you
