a drugstore makeup look this is just a
super simple step-by-step tutorial
basically showing you guys how I do my
brows blush my contour everything using
drugstore products you can add our -
things to accommodate you and what you
want for the day but this is just what I
came up with I think this is a great
everyday look something I would do for
every day if you had the time of course
this is definitely not a running late
look but I've had a lot of requests to
use more drugstore products in my videos
so I figured this would be a great way
to kind of sit down and show you guys
some products I've been really loving
lately and they're all from the
drugstore so now that you guys know what
the video is going to be about it's time
to introduce you to a new a member of my
little family I was so excited I'm
moving in two weeks and I know I
probably shouldn't got another dog right
now but I'm moving and I went to the
pound
because it's all her on Facebook her
name is rose I must show you guys I saw
rose on Facebook and I was like oh my
god I have to have her now some people
are like oh my gosh you have three dogs
now I have to say one thing you guys
probably don't know about me is I was
raised around a ton of dogs like we had
eight dogs at one point and then one of
them had a litter of like 10 we had so
many dogs at one point and I was
actually raised around Dalmatians those
were like the main dogs that we had she
is actually a great pyrenees
Dalmatian Mix we do believe she's only
four months old and she's huge like
ginormous
look at that face I mean come on how
could you leave that face look do you
see yourself but she is ginormous for
four months she's gonna be a big girl
she's one of the sweetest dogs she
follows me around everywhere and I could
be without her so I figured I would
introduce you guys to Rose because she's
probably gonna be around in the back of
the video while doing this tutorial so I
want you guys to see her to let you see
her one more time say buying everybody
Rose cy cy hmm I hope you guys don't
mind the tofu in this video I just
wanted to do a chop through because I
want to explain certain products to you
guys so I hope you don't mind it but
yeah we're going to go ahead and
sign off I hope you guys enjoy this
video thank you so much for watching
don't forget to like it and subscribe
and I'll see you all in my next one bye
she's sticking up okay so before we get
started I just really quickly want to
say I've already primed my eyes and put
tape on tape is optional I have more
downturned eyes so I like to add tape at
the end to just create a nice sharp edge
and also helps lift up the eyes if you
have more down during eyes if you just
kind of you could even take a makeup
remover wipe and just make your eye
shadow more angled here on the outer
corner it's going to help lift up the
eye so that's a little tip for you if
you don't have downturned eyes or
anything you don't have to do this step
and for primers for my eyes I have not
found a drugstore eyeshadow primer that
I love now this is the only thing that
is not drugstore in this video so if you
have a favorite one let me know in the
comments below if you have oily eyelids
which is what my issue is I have such
oily eyelids that even a Mac Paint Pot
can't hold up like I have to use to to
make sure everything stays nice and
matte and then I actually does not
crease it all so if you have a favorite
one from the drugstore for oily eyelids
let me know or even if you have dry eye
lids just let us know your eyelid type
which kind of sounds weird but leave in
the comments below if you have dry eye
lids oily and what your favorite primer
is just so we could help everybody out
whoever is watching this video I'm using
two hiren ones which I hundred and
thousand percent recommend so if you're
wondering which ones that I stand by
100% I'll leave them in the description
box below so the first shade we're going
to take today is this one by Ulta and
it's called sable this is a great
transition shade for more medium to
light skin tones if you're darker I
would if you're darker than me I
wouldn't suggest this just because it's
really not super pigmented so it's not
going to show up so I would go up a step
above this one I like this one my skin
tone and it has a really nice warm brown
shade which is my favorite so I'm just
going to be putting this into the crease
it's just going to add definition and if
you're really wanting something super
quick for the day you can throw in this
in your crease or even your bronzer into
the crease that could honestly be your
eyeshadow for the day but I'm going to
do a
more since you know we're making a whole
tutorial out of this if you guys are
wondering I am gonna be doing a video
all on brushes soon and well you guys
know my favorite ones are which ones
that you should buy and yeah I'm just
I'm going to do one very soon for you
because it's been highly requested more
requested than I ever expected it to be
so just keep your eye out for that okay
taking the influence in fullest take any
infamous Maybelline the nudes palette
what I'm going to do today is I'm going
to first take what not even know what
I'm doing quite honest with you I want
to do more of them that I so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take this
shade right here and I'm going to put
this one all over my lid but I'm going
to leave the inner corner blank so
you'll see what I'm talking about I'm
just going to put this out here on the
lid take it all the way to the end of
the tape if you have tape on I'm going
to leave this part right here blank now
this isn't going to be like a crazy cool
I look or anything like that this is
going to be something simple and easy
for everyday so again just putting that
on the lid um
drugstore shadows like this palette is
not my favorite but it's hard to come
across really awesome eye shadows at the
drugstore that's probably one of the
hardest things to find usually everybody
can find awesome foundations and things
like that the eyeshadows are definitely
hits and misses of the drugstore world
just super difficult to find really good
ones other than like makeup geek
obviously has great ones I don't have
too many of hers but I know that they're
awesome because I have just a few but
like actually at the drugstore
Maybelline L'Oreal if you're watching
this I'm going to step up your game
because pigmentation is not always there
and sometimes they look a little choppy
so yeah but this is actually a pretty
decent palette I give it that so now I'm
going to do is I'm actually to take this
Maybelline quad and coral Oasis these by
far are the best I shadow is for
pigmentation at the drugstore like
seriously they're amazing only problem I
have with them is a lot of them are just
shimmer palette and it's not very
convenient for people who don't want
completely shimmery I I'm personally not
the type that loves just a full-out
shimmery eye light I think it's just a
little too much for me but if you wanted
to bring eyeshadow these are awesome
they have some that do have matte shades
in them but kind of hard to come back
I'm going to take this little shimmery
shade and the Coyle Oasis palette and
I'm going to put this in the inner
corner right here this is just going to
really brighten everything up and make
you look more awake so we're just going
to apply that in there it's really
pretty like these are so stick your
finger to and blend out the edges of
that because we just want it to help
brighten up okay now I'm going to do I'm
going to take this shade right here with
that same brush I already started doing
this I'm going to put right here in the
outer corner and a little bit into the
crease so just like this it's just going
to add a little bit more definition so
I'm just going to put that right in
there with that same brush not really
being precise
and then I'm going to go in with a clean
blending brush and the lighter gray we
used right next to it and just blend
that out blend in the crease on the lid
everywhere
now some people probably wouldn't want
to do the gray on the outer half but for
me I just like that extra definition but
for every day you could totally skip
this if you wanted to you don't have to
do it the kind of person where I need a
smoky eye in my life like I have to I
don't know what it is I just love like
lighter makeup looks are nice but I
really love a smoky eye just makes me so
happy
it sounds so corny but it really does
after taking off the tape this is what
you've got is just a really easy I look
like so easy um it's basically just
blending everything and all this does is
just really add some definition to my I
am going to take a little bit more of
that shimmer shade and put this in the
inner part right here too then for me I
like to line my upper lash line so I'm
just going to use this NYX two-timer
this is really nice as a cold umm
eyeliner on one side and then a liquid
liner on the other I haven't used this
in a minute I used to love this though
hopefully the liquid would not dry it
out but I'm just going to line them I'm
not going to do anything crazy it's kind
of dried out usually this is actually
like very very black but mine's kind of
dried out so I really recommend this one
but right now when you use a BH 1 which
BH Cosmetics is also very very
affordable it's also personal preference
on how thick you want your liner you
could do it however thick you want um I
literally what I do is I'm like okay I'm
going to do a thin line and then I end
up messing up I'm like okay we're gonna
thick today that's usually how liner
goes for me then we're going to do we're
going to take the whole side of it boop
I'm going to take the cold side of this
NYX liner and I'm just going to line my
upper waterline this is going to help
darken up that lash line so when you put
mascara on it makes your lashes look
fuller and just looks more complete like
your makeup looks more put together when
you line your upper lash line so I'm
just going to do that
now so today we're going to use a new
mascara I just have these in my drawer
and I really wanted to experiment like I
have a few from me just shopping I just
bought these so we're going to
experiment and see if these are good if
you wanted to if you're like me you just
can't go without false lashes grow put
false lashes on I'm probably gonna put
someone after this video I'm going to
try out this Maybelline lash sensational
one says a full fan effect very black
water oh shoot this is waterproof
I hate waterproof the hell frames
anyways one mascara I absolutely adore
from the drugstore is a L'Oreal
voluminous mistake yep so good but I
wanted to try something different today
so I just have to get my didn't remember
out tonight I like this packaging now I
think it's really cute just like chic I
do love Maybelline the rocket to mascara
is so good I can work with it
not bad I actually like it good stuff
good stuff okay so now we got the eyes
done they're just nice and light nothing
too crazy and the eye shadows just
aren't that pigmented so they're not
going to be like BAM in your face like
an urban decay eyeshadow palette lighter
more rock moving on to primer I haven't
never talked about this but I've used it
a couple times and actually really liked
it doesn't necessarily focus on keeping
you mat this is a covergirl and Olay
simply ages age less serum primer and
I've tried a couple times and I really
do like it I think it makes my skin is
super smooth and I don't know I just
like randomly picked it up one day and I
was like oh okay it's actually pretty
decent so it's a little bit thicker
of course that's like too much but we're
going to work with it um it doesn't
necessarily keep you Matt I just like
how smooth it makes my face so we're
just going to apply that all over and
then on top of that it doesn't my skin a
little red though so but now I'm going
to use the new foundations from L'Oreal
these are the infallible Pro matte 24
hour foundations I like these
I like these a lot it's been work to
find a good drugstore foundation that
I'm just like oh my gosh I need this in
my life but I'm really really
I'm loving these so far I think they're
great so I'm going to apply mine with a
kabuki brush and this isn't the color
fresh beige I think this one's going to
match my self-tanner best have fresh
beige and Sun beige this one's pretty
yellow but with concealer and powder and
everything will make it work I think I
would even like this with a Beauty
Blender to be quite honest with you so
it's definitely more of a medium
coverage foundation like I have to go in
with concealer but I I do really like it
I think it's a nice finish it is a
lightweight finish and it doesn't feel
sticky on the skin like it dries really
quickly so I just recommend blending it
in fairly quickly um but I like it for
concealer I kind of Barry with
concealers especially from the drugstore
but today I'm going to actually be using
the HD concealer from NYX a really great
spot concealer is this one from NYX as
well this is the conceal correct contour
kit this is a dupe for the Mac Pro and
conceal palette and it's literally an
exact dupe the shades are just a little
bit different but but it's basically the
same thing you have the pink undertones
on this side the more yellow undertones
on this side and you could just
experiment with it and if you have a
hard time finding like your perfect
concealer I highly recommend pallets
like this because they're awesome and
you can also use those contouring stuff
but I use them to mix and match
especially if I'm self-tanning so I love
them but for underneath the eyes I'm
going to use this HD one from NYX I
think this one's a little light for me
but Rome with the punches here people
and this is in the color beige so I'm
just going to take it and do a couple
strokes underneath my eyes because this
is going to highlight and just bring
everything together you don't have to do
all this since we are doing everyday but
I like to highlight my face especially
for my foundations a little too dark
because it'll just help lighten up the
face and bring it all together
gotta blend that out with a Beauty
Blender see how it really lightens up
the foundation but really brightens up
the face and makes you look a lot more
awake which is really important I feel
like for makeup for me if I'm doing my
makeup I like to do
do it all or nothing at all so I like to
really make sure I highlight
highlighting and contouring all of that
is like my favorite thing to do ever
because it just really makes your face
stand out a cheekbones stand out
everything just looks so much better
when you do highlighting and contouring
so I'm just going to take my foundation
brush and blend out the edges looking in
the viewfinder to see how it looks not
too shall we great concealer though I
used to hate this concealer then I
started to love it and I like to take
this concealer in the inner corners of
my eyes because I get really dark right
in here so I just tap it in there
and it really helps bring it all
together
then I'm also just for my personal
preference I am going to take it on my
nose where I put it
nose is a little bit bigger and I like
to highlight the center of it just to
really make it slender out so the tip if
you have more of a wide nose like I do
this will really help bring out the
center of the nose and just help it make
it look a little bit smaller been doing
this forever now and I just I cannot do
my makeup without doing the center my
nose just set my under eyes and my
concealer I don't really set my face
anymore it's just not something that I
do all the time I usually just blot my
face if I'm out and about but to set my
concealer I'm going to use this one from
Wet n Wild it's to take on the day a
mattifying powder I don't apply a lot of
this I'm sorry I'm trying to find my
brush I apply just a little bit to set
that concealer because you want to make
sure you set everything so it does not
crease and this is a translucent powder
so it's not going to add any coverage
it's just going to set that makeup and I
really like it I've actually been using
this for a while even just to blot my
skin this is the BH Cosmetics bombshell
bronze bronzer I used to use one um from
NYC those the darkest bronzer that they
had it's amazing definitely definitely
definitely get it I can't find it I
think it expired and I threw it away to
be quite honest with you but I'm going
to use this one from BH Cosmetics like
I've said before they are more
affordable they're just online but
they're more affordable this is in the
shade diva and
going to put this on the high points of
my face I told you guys I really like to
bronze contour that's like my my
favorite thing about makeup is working
with the face and bring out your
features with makeup and it's just all
about techniques and what you know and
where you place product so just to me
it's so fascinating for face I don't
know I and a little bit of more
definition just underneath my cheekbones
I'm going to do a little bit of
contouring because I like for my
cheekbones to kind of stand out more a
great one for that is this NYX blush in
taupe and I just like this a lot it's
just a nice ashy color and it's great to
put underneath the cheekbone and just
really makes everything pop like if you
were to more than warm toned bronzer it
doesn't look as natural as the more ashy
tones because she colors going to get
more of that shadow which is obviously
going to look more natural than having a
warm bronzer just stuck in the contour
line so that's why I really like this
one it's awesome and it blends really
really well it just looks so natural so
just going to place this in my contour
area and blend it a little bit upwards
and you can see the difference right
there that it makes and it's not like
super super noticeable it's just adding
a little bit more definition and really
lifts up that cheekbone I far the best
thing to contour with in my opinion at
the drugstore I don't think I've been
able to find the taupe shade I think I
found this one online at cherry culture
calm so if you can't find it in store go
to cherry culture calm they have a bunch
of drugstore stuff even discontinued
stuff
that you can pick up from them they are
going to skip highlighter there are some
good ones from Physicians Formula but to
be quite honest with you I'm not going
to stay here and act like I have an
all-time favorite one in the drugstore
cuz I don't so I'm going to go in with
this blush from NYX it's called solstice
and since I'm not using a highlighter
this one does have shimmer in it so it's
still going to be that glow and that
healthy look to my skin I love it
because this is a more warm and I like
it with the kind of gray cool toned eye
I like I like mixing warm and cool tell
I just think it's fun I don't know it's
makeup you got to do it if you don't
want to do it you can use a cool tone
blush if you want to but I just like
more warm so I'm going to just apply
this to my cheeks and you can see it
just kind of warms up the skin so really
pretty kind of peachy bronze shade and I
don't love it oh love the color and I'm
going to take a Joe fiber brush and just
blend that out now for eyebrows I'm
going to be using this NYX eyebrow gel I
really like this a lot is came out not
too long ago I believe but this is what
I'm going to be using today for my
eyebrows because I just really like it
it is more of a gel so when you put it
on your brows you kind of have to work
quickly with it and you want to make
sure you kind of hurry up and fill in
your brows because it does set fairly
fast once it sets like it's there it's
not going anywhere it's just gonna keep
it round hairs in place all day the
color I'm using is chocolate by the way
it's a little bit more of an lighter
brown or ashy as well you were just a
jangling and honey
those little collars this is just such
an easy product to work with like I love
this so much probably the best drugstore
definitely the best drugstore crowd
growl types out there so that's one brow
done we're all seriously make a makeup
look like it is insane but I don't know
what it is I feel like I can get them
done pretty quickly now and I love the
way that they look it's just oh no they
have gotten used to doing my brows they
used to take me forever but when I use
the Anasazi abroad ways it literally
took me years to fill in my eyebrows I
feel like now we're going to do is just
set our brows in place I'm using this
you don't have to do this stuff because
the next brow gel does a really good job
but I'm just going to do it today this
is a Loreal brow stylist plumper in ooh
honey medium to dark you know they put
this thing like microscopic down here
you can't ever tell the colors I'm just
going to run this through my brows
really quickly finishing up these eyes
I'm going to take the cold side again
for this NYX liner and just gonna line
my waterline they take a flat brush like
this I don't know why I'm showing you
nose I'm going to take this brush I'm
going to take the darker shade in here
like this darker gray right here I'm
going to put this close to my lash line
possible this is going to help justify
that bottom lash line a little bit more
I'm going to connect this to the shadow
on the outer half as well just to kind
of bring it all in
train then I'm going to go in with the
lighter shade right next to it that we
used all over the lid I'm just going to
blend this out just so there's not like
a harsh line underneath there not me
personally I like smoking out my lower
lash line um I just I like it I don't
feel free to not do it but now I'm going
to take the cream shade right here I'm
going to put this underneath my brow
just to again highlight I'm going to
take that it is a matte shade so I like
that
for this look just love me a matte brow
bone highlight I need lashes in my life
okay I'm going to quickly apply lashes
I'm using these from ardell the glamor
whispies under books so you can see
lashes just kind of make everything
above a boom ba-ba-boom kind of person I
just had to make it happen so taking
this taunt take this lip liner from
Jordana called tawny and then I line my
lips with this nice and look fuller and
it also helps keep your lip product on
for a lot longer and also to keep it
from like feathering outside the lines
after that might apply one of my
favorite lipsticks at all times this is
the wet and wild
Fergie a daily lipstick it's just a nude
very nude then to kind of dr. deepen it
up I'm going to take this L'Oreal Paris
nude ballet I really love this one this
is a great little lip gloss and I love
the applicator so this is the full face
using drugstore makeup I really hope you
guys liked it it was just super
requested and I wanted to do it for you
there's not like a specific technique or
anything I just figured I would show you
guys some products that I love and show
you that you can get a full face with
the drugstore products so hope you guys
enjoyed this please give it a thumbs up
if you did like it and I will see you
all in my next video bye
