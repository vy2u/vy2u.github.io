a luxury makeup haul review swatches
Tryon I'm showing you guys everything I
was just going to do a haul like just
showing you guys different products that
I got and all of that when I first
received these products a couple weeks
ago but I was like this is so
expensive I need to review it I need to
try it out before I let you guys know my
thoughts if you should buy it a lot of
this stuff is going back and some of it
I am keeping so that is what I'm gonna
share with you guys today I'm going to
be brutally honest in this video I'm not
going to beat around the bush or make up
excuses for different products which
kind of sounds harsh but I'm not trying
to be harsh I'm just trying to let you
know if you should try it out or if you
should just pass on it because there's
more affordable options which I'm all
about affordable lately you guys know
this I'm all about finding dupes and
things like that and I feel like I have
some good alternatives for you guys in
this video so you want to see my
thoughts a review demo everything on
these products then just keep watching
before we get started if you want to
know my lip combo I believe these are
coming out September 19th I will leave
in this video when they are coming out
but these are the new lorac pro liquid
lipsticks I have soft mouth all over my
lips and then I have new rows more in
the center just to kind of lighten it up
a little bit the first thing we're going
to talk about is probably the most
disappointing thing and the one that I'm
like this is not worth the money at all
like you could get something way better
for your money this is the by Terry eye
design palette and this is in the shade
number two comes in this really pretty
package right here and it does have a
little cloth now the packaging is really
cute kind of has that bubble effect at
the top I really like it and it's just
really sleek and pretty and these are
the shades in the palette you can see
that there is a ton of fallout right off
the bat with this palette I've used this
quite a few times and every time I'm
just so disappointed I bought this
palette thinking the colors were
beautiful and that they're going to be
super pigmented so what I have on my
eyes right now
touching these eyeshadows they're really
soft and they feel really good and they
look really good but when you start
applying them to your eyes it's kind of
like they're just not as intense as they
look in the pan or swatch on your
fingers I tried a fluffy brush with some
of these
try to pencil brush and when I start
digging into this palette and trying to
use different colors on my eyes I just
get so uninspired because I get
frustrated and I'm like this palette is
not good I feel like you could totally
buy something else at least from Sephora
that's cheaper this is a 96 dollar
palette which i think is crazy
if these colors were pigmented enough
maybe it would be worth the money but in
my opinion there is just so much fallout
which normally I don't have a problem
with fallout I'm okay with it usually
but this just got so dusty and crazy
that I was like uh not a huge fan I just
feel like the pigmentation and the way
it blends is just not worth it it's not
my favorite palette whatsoever I'm so
disappointed in it another thing I don't
like is that there's not a really nice
cream shade in here now there are
different shade selections you could
totally pick a different palette with a
cream shade and a great mid-tone brown
whatever but I just wish this one right
here was like a cream color to put all
over my lid this is actually like a
green yellow tint and all over my eyes
this would just look weird and not right
so I'm not a big fan of these like I
said it's what I have in my eyes and
they're just not as intense as I wish if
you want something that's a light wash
of color and you want to spend ninety
six dollars on it then you could go for
this but I mean you could go to wet and
wild and get a palette and get a light
wash of color and not spend ninety six
dollars on this eyeshadow palettes next
product I want to talk to you guys about
is this Dior Addict it lash mascara this
was twenty seven fifty and I got the
shade black I've heard great things
about Dior mascaras I can't remember
which one is like super popular it's
like supposed to be really intense in
black and volumizing if you're looking
for that this is not the mascara for you
again this is the Dior Addict it lash
the one thing I will say that I like
about this is the one and because it's
spiky at the very end it just gets right
into that inner corner and puts mascara
on those inner corner lashes which
sometimes can be really hard with
certain mascaras but this is more of
like a natural lash mascara that's why I
put falsies on Szell's like no I need
more anymore you know I can't can't have
a natural lash if I put mascara on I
will say this did separate really well
it has a great wand to do that and if
you do like more of that natural look
kind
like a no makeup makeup look this might
be good for you but to me it did not
curl my lashes or anything like that and
it wasn't as black as I wish it was
personally use the Maybelline lash
sensational over this mascara it gives
me a little bit more volume or what not
now again this might be what this
mascara is for just to give you a
natural lash look but that's not what
I'm going for so I'm gonna have to
return this as well the packaging is so
gorgeous I'm obsessed with it and again
I love the wand and that it gets in the
inner corner but I want to try out a
different one and this one just I know I
will not use it because it's not as
volumizing as I wish it was starting
this video off to a really rough start
I'm sorry I'm just trying to be honest
next thing I want to talk to you guys
about is this foundation that I tried
it's the Giorgio Armani designer lifts
sunscreen smoothing firming foundation
this does have SPF 20 and I got the
shade 5.5 it's what I have on my face
right now so I wanted to try this one
because I knew the Armani luminous silk
foundation was more for dry skin and
then it was really luminous and I knew I
just wanted to stay away from that one
and I thought this won't be great to try
I think I read online that it was good
for combination oily skin and I was like
let me try that I have not heard anyone
talk about this this was sixty seven
dollars even you do get one fluid ounce
which is normal and it lasts for 12
months you are supposed to shake it
before you apply it to your face now I'm
kind of like mixed on this one I love
the way that it looks on my skin and I
love the way that it blends out I'll
talk about the brush that I blended it
out with in just a second but I love the
way it looks on my skin because it looks
really natural now this is more of a
dewy foundation if you are very oily
this is not good for the summer time I
did wear this last week out and about
when I was running errands and holy no
no no no it was not working for me it
was just way too oily I was so greasy
wetter than the day but I love the way
that it looked when I first applied it
so I'm not returning this yet I'm gonna
try it out for fall and winter
but if you are more normal to dry maybe
even just a little bit combo you would
like this if your combo you're probably
gonna have to powder your face
throughout the day just to mattify the
skin if that's what you want unless you
want to glow you can just leave it
but I think if you're dry to a normal
you would really like this because it is
such a beautiful finish and it does
cover really well I think it just looks
like skin and that's what I love the
most about it and once you set it with
powder you're good but if you have oily
skin and you live in a really humid hot
area this is going to melt off your face
and just not look as cute but if I'm
filming or just doing my makeup and I'm
not going to leave the house much I will
apply this because it's very lightweight
and it just feels so good on the skin I
like it just not for the summertime so
maybe fall winter this will be my go-to
foundation to talk about the brush that
I blend out the foundation with this is
the I'm probably going to butcher this
you guys like I can read pretty much
anything on this - foundation brush but
it's the de corte foundation brush
everything else is in a different
language and I have no idea what it
means
so this brush was $40 you get a little
case that comes with it it fits
perfectly in there which is great for
traveling it's really compact and this
brush is so freakin soft I like this
brush a lot it just feels so good and I
love this angle that it has because you
can get right underneath the eyes and go
right past your eyeshadow and you don't
have to worry about messing up your
eyeshadow or anything like that it will
even sharpen out that edge if you want
it to it just is such an easy brush to
use if you don't like little short
handles like this you probably won't
enjoy this brush but honestly when
you're blending out it just I don't know
it's it doesn't bother me whatsoever I
really like it so the bristles are
pretty tightly packed in here but they
do give quite a bit just to make sure
you really blend out that foundation you
can do for foundation and for concealer
the only thing with this is that the
concealer when you use it it will be a
little bit more sheer just because
you're kind of swiping it out and
pressing it in I feel like this just
blends everything so well that it gives
you that natural looking skin you know
what I'm saying like you still have
coverage but it looks like skin and it
looks a little bit more natural I love
this with the giorgio morning foundation
i think these two together are so
beautiful i also love it with other
foundations that i have it just i don't
know it blends so well i just kind of
swipe it over my face like this
I don't go in circular motions I just
kind of glide it like that and it's so
quick so easy I really like it I think
it's worth it if you're not into brushes
and you don't really like to have
anything sheared out you might not like
this because it does kind of shoot out
foundation a little bit now what I say
this is a must-have like you need this
in your life I don't know if you love
makeup I highly recommend checking it
out because it's just so easy and quick
and if you want a multipurpose brush
then definitely try this because you
could even use it for contour it is
expensive it's just one of those things
that's going to be a personal preference
to you if you want to spend the money on
a brush not like a strop everything you
need to go get this right now you know
what I'm saying
but it's not bad product whatsoever I'm
definitely keeping it let's talk about
concealer so I have this one right here
again I'm probably going to butcher this
this is the clay 2po I think I got that
right clay to Poe concealer in the shade
beige so there's little packaging that
it comes in and this is a stick
concealer and when I ordered this I kind
of didn't have that high expectations
for it because I'm usually not a huge
fan of stick concealers like this
because sometimes they're a little too
creamy and then make my oily skin just
like come out and like look disgusting
and then they'll crease underneath my
eyes and it's just not cute I love this
concealer it is creamy but it's not too
creamy it's not like that oily base
concealer you know what I'm saying now I
have used this concealer with this brush
and I've used with Beauty Blender in the
video you'll see I personally like it
better with a Beauty Blender you get a
little bit more coverage when you use a
sponge and just Pat it into your skin
then you do with the brush a brush is
really going to share this out and make
it look a little bit more natural and
then the Beauty Blender is going to
really build it up I like that though I
like that you have the option to have a
more full coverage or you can share out
with a brush so I think this is so worth
it I've been using this non-stop with a
stick concealer you don't get a ton of
product that's it right there but it has
really great coverage and it blends
really well sometimes things like this
can be too stiff and with a sponge you
can't really blend it out this does not
do that you do have to take a little bit
more time with your sponge to blend it
out but honestly and I know thang I just
blend it out I'm good to go and I love
the finish of
so I like this I'm keeping it it lasts
all day it doesn't crease and this looks
great under my la prairie powder
foundation which you guys know I'm
obsessed with this looks great
underneath that if you want to see it in
action I will leave my latest date night
get ready with me below that's where I
use this combo and I love this lasted
all night
oh righty so I did purchase this la
Prairie cellular treatment loose powder
this is a hundred dollar product now I
first purchased this product I had no
idea that it came with a travel size so
you open it up and you see this little
guy and not first I was like oh hell no
no this is not $100 but then I kept
digging and you have this big bad boy
right here underneath so I love that
they did that you get the big size which
is 2 ounces and then you get the travel
size which is 0.35 ounces that's a lot
of translucent powder that's going to
last you a very long time I also love
the packaging of this especially the
travel size one you open it up I've used
both of these so you open it up and you
have a sponge and then you have this you
can open and close the sifter so it's
not going to get completely messy down
there and then this one I got rid of the
sponge but it does get a little bit more
messy but if you keep this at your house
you'll be fine the pros of this product
is I really like it I think it
definitely gives you like an airbrushed
finish I think it looks gorgeous I have
it on this side of my face right here
and it blends out really well it's one
of those powders that's not going to
make you look dry and cakey this is one
of those powers that's really gonna sink
into the skin and make you look nice and
airbrushed and it's just gonna look
really gorgeous underneath the eyes it's
not going to cake up underneath here or
anything like that but I have to say I
think this flower Beauty translucent
setting powder is a great alternative
for it because it's really finely milled
just like this it has a little bit more
of a tint this is the shade lo1 I like
this color a little bit better it has a
peachy tone to it this one's kind of
just like a regular translucent powder
kind of like the Laura Mercier one this
has like that same texture and it gives
the same exact effect that the law
prairie one gives ever since I try this
out
I've just been totally obsessed with it
I feel like it makes me look flawless
really does camouflage pores and I don't
know I just like this a little bit more
it's just I don't know and you can get
this from Walmart it's really affordable
I know a lot of people love this this is
a really great powder if you want to
spend the money on it and get an assload
of translucent powder and you'll never
have to buy another one for like years
this is the way to go but if you don't
want to spend the money on this and you
want an alternative the flower Beauty
translucent powder is the way to go I
love this powder this powder just looks
amazing and when you blend it out it
just gives you that soft blurred effect
and I just am obsessed with it I will
say that I think the law Prairie wants a
little bit better than the laura mercier
one to me I've tried both of these
products out it just doesn't meet the
flower beauty transition powder for me
so this is the G Vaughn she mr. brow
filler and this is the tinted brow
filler and it's supposed to be
waterproof this is in the shade o -
blonde
I got blonde because on line it just
didn't look like you know it was going
to be that light first off the packaging
is freaking luxurious like I think it is
so gorgeous
I want a lipstick like this but this
blonde shade just did not work for me um
I'm getting gimme brow vibes which I
believe the gimme brow is cheaper than
this one you can also get the Ulta brow
filler I forget what it's called but
that's a dupe for the benefit one so if
you wanted a cheaper alternative to both
of those products the Ulta brow gel
thing is freaking phenomenal this color
it did not work for me the one thing I
will say is it locked these brows into
place because I did set my brows on this
side with it have it on this side now on
this side you can't really tell but it
really did set those brows into place
and they're they're not like stiff and
you know like straw light but it does
hold them down I just didn't see a huge
difference with the filling effect
pretty sure this doesn't have any fibers
or claimed to have any fibers in this
product so I didn't notice a huge
difference with it filling in my brows
I'm trying to be hard on these products
I feel like I'm being so mean but like
it's expensive man I
the next thing I want to talk about is
this Tom Ford bronzer brush and I have
been eyeing this for a while just
because it's so stinkin beautiful and I
was so excited to get this in the mail
this brush was a hundred and fifteen
dollars I know I know
this brush is so soft there's a lot of
bristles in it they're packed in there
tightly but they're not too tight again
they have a lot of movement to them
this brush blends out bronzer so well
you can use this for so many different
things you can use it for powder for
bronzer for blush I mean it's just such
a phenomenal brush I really love it I
personally am going to keep this because
I love the handle I love the bristles
and I just love applying product to my
face with it and this is a brush I will
use every single time that I apply my
makeup so this is definitely staying I
wanted to show you kind of a similar
brush it's looking a little janky but it
is a similar brush if you did not want
to pay $115 for this one I do think this
is worth it it's great quality I mean
it's even got some weight to it because
of those bristles in the front I mean
it's just it's a really great brush if
you wanted a cheaper alternative this is
the morphe m-52 7 you can see the
difference in them this one is a little
bit tightly packed this one's kind of
like spread out all over the place
I'll have as much control with this one
as you do with this one because the
shapes are just completely different but
if you wanted kind of that same concept
of the bigger bronzer brush then you
could buy this one this one is a nice
product so for me I like this one I get
a little bit more control it blends out
a little bit better and it's just a
little faster to use then this one but I
do love this brush um I have used it
many times it just kind of spreads your
bronzer out a little too far just want
to like clamp it in like that
but you can't so if you wanted an
alternative this is a good one but for
me I think this is a great brush and I
highly recommend purchasing it I think
it's phenomenal now I'm going to talk
about the bronzer that I use this
Steiger lon
Paris terracotta bronzer duo and is the
limited edition 2016 bronzer I don't
know there's
really a name so this is what it looks
like such beautiful packaging now I do
love grill on products I have a couple
other bronzers from them and they're
just a warm terracotta bronzer they're
gorgeous and I love it you can see that
it does have a blush shade in the middle
and it does have a little bit of shimmer
it was more of like a little overlay of
shimmer now that I've really dug into it
there's not a lot on there there's just
little specks here and there this
product was eighty two dollars now I do
like this product normally I'm not a
huge two colours in one kind of thing
like if it's supposed to bury bronzer I
wanted to be one shade of the bronzer
but it actually mix the two together to
bronze my face and I love it it's just
such a warm sunkissed glow I think it is
beautiful it's not too pigmented it's
not not pigmented enough it's that
perfect bronzer shade you also dip your
brush into here and get a little bit of
that blush and top it on your cheeks you
can mix them and use them as your blush
if you wanted to and the one thing I
have to say that I love about this
bronzer is the most eager long ones like
I said are that really rich terracotta
bronzer they're really warm sometimes
they can look super orange if you're not
careful but this is that perfect
mid-tone bronzer it has a little bit of
a shiness in it it has a little bit of
warmth so I can use this as my nose
contour because it's not too warm since
it does have that little bit of a sheen
is to it which is why I like to go for
for my nose contour and I feel like this
is just awesome you can build it up you
have a light layer it's just one of my
favorites and I think the packaging is
really gorgeous so I highly recommend
this one I definitely think it's worth
the money especially if you're more fair
to me and skin tones if you're a little
bit darker then I would not suggest this
because it's probably not going to show
up on your skin as well speaking of
contouring I purchased this artiste
elite collection mirror finish brush
this is the linear 3 brush and I have
not purchased in our teeth brush in so
long because I don't even use my other
one as much as I thought I would I did
really like it but like I never reach
for it I don't know why I guess cuz I
hate cleaning it and I just like don't
want to clean it but this is a really
small precise brush I've seen a couple
people use this for their nose contour I
forget who I saw you
this but I have to go by it because I
was like I love contouring my nose I
will say the white of this product you
can't really tell on camera but it gets
super dirty really easily because I'd
use it with bronzer and everything so
that part if that annoys the crap out of
you that's gonna annoy you with this one
I don't know if it's just because of the
style I went with I mean maybe you can
get the black one the linear' 3 brush in
black I don't know I don't know too much
about our teeth brushes other than the
fact that they're stupid expensive I
used to go for like a fluffy blending
brush like this before I discovered this
one but this gives me more of that
skinny nose effect which I like I'm
still kind of getting used to it and how
much product I should put on it and how
to blend it but it does really give you
that perfect even line and then I just
blend it out with a duo fiber brush and
I'm good to go so I really like this I
would say use a little bit of product at
a time whenever you dip this into your
bronzer if you guys want me to go on
Amazon and try to find a dupe I can do
that for you guys as well but so far I
like this I definitely think it's worth
the money so this is the Shawn to cali
future skin gel foundation and this is
$76 you do get one fluid ounce and it is
a oil-free foundation this is what it
looks like this is the shade sand it's a
little dark for me but I made it work
with a little bit concealer now whatever
product said that it's oil-free I'm like
mmm I need to try that because it might
work for me as long as you don't add
more oil we should be good to go so I
want to try this out and I have to say
it's not my favorite it was really hard
to blend I tried it with a brush and
with a Beauty Blender
I definitely had to use a brush with
this product because it's just so hard
to blend out and it was really heavy on
the skin this was definitely a medium
coverage foundation but what really got
me is just how heavy it was like I could
feel it on my skin it felt like it never
set and it was just so difficult to
blend out it was not my favorite
so had to pass on this one this one's
going back for sure guys I'm gonna get
like a 700 all that refund with all
these returns ok the next product I want
to talk about is this G bond sheet cult
or waterproof retractable eyeliner so
this is what the packaging hello this is
what the packaging looks like this is in
the color black and
this is what this looks like now when I
first use this I opened it up and it did
that I didn't think it would do it again
but look at that it did the whole thing
fell out the first time that I so this
was a $26 eyeliner and for $26 on line
art that should not be breaking off
like that so even though I did that I
put it back in there and I tried it out
and it is a very black eyeliner okay
you're not gonna be able to tell cuz
it's like all broken it's a very black
creamy eyeliner like look at that that
is insane very very black on the
waterline and it does last quite a while
I mean it doesn't last forever but if
you want to put it on your lower lash
line you can blend it out and it's not
going to smudge everywhere so I do like
that about this product but I do not
think it is worth the money because I
have been trying out this NYC city proof
24 hour waterproof eyeliner pencil and I
actually like this one a little bit
better so you can see the NYC one is
just as black if not a little bit
blacker in my opinion has that same gel
creamy formula but this lasts a little
bit longer on your waterline and again
it has that same benefit of not smudging
on your lower lash line also doesn't
bleed on the corners of your eye that is
a huge issue that I have with some
eyeliners that are kind of creamy like
this and are really black is that my
outer corner in my inner corner will
start to bleed and it's like a hot damn
mess it just does not look cute this
does not do that and the jiangshi one
does not do that but to save a buttload
of money basically like $24 I would just
go with my c1 because it's amazing it's
a good do basically the same exact
things okay guys so that is it for my
high-end luxury super luxury haul review
and triumph for you guys I really hope
you enjoyed it I know a lot of these
products did not work out for me but
just know that is for me they did not
work out honestly it was just an
expensive haul and I wanted to see what
was worth the money what wasn't and
really give you guys my honest opinion
and some dupes for you to save your
