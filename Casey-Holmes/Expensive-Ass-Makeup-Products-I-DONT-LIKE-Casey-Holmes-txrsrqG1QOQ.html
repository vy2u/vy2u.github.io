today I am going to share with you some
luxury makeup products that honestly
were not worth the money I was going to
do an extensive ass luxury makeup haul
but I haven't been able to sit down and
really try absolutely everything out
that I bought but I have tried quite a
bit of product that I do not like like
this is probably the most disappointing
expensive ass makeup haul that ever done
now I have some things that are super
luxury and then I have some things that
are just high-end so I'm going to tell
you all about these products and why I
don't like them and hopefully save you
some cash and if you're wondering I do
have extensions in these are not gummy
vitamins these are extensions
I love these extensions as the first
time I've had a man since I've had short
hair and they look so good don't they
okay I could do a little bit better but
I just went out and shot my outfit and I
have my extensions in because I was like
you know what let's add some sass to
this and put him in and I was like oh my
god long hair I love that I can like
switch up my mood I could have short
hair for like sweet innocent sometimes
sassy depending on how style it and then
the long hair is just like Oberto if
you're wondering what extensions I wear
I will link them down below I was
thinking of doing a video on how I style
them like incorporate them into my short
hair still trying to find like my
favorite way to style these so it
doesn't look like I have short hair you
know what I mean so once I figure that
out then I'll definitely share with you
guys but I feel so good with this long
hair but I will feel good when I take em
out too I have a coupon code down below
I think it's for five dollars off if
you're interested so real quick before I
start this video I do want to say it's
something in here is like your holy
grail and I'm sitting here like bashing
it don't be upset about it I mean it's
just personal opinion everybody has
different preferences skin types skin
texture all that kind of stuff if you
haven't already be sure to subscribe and
let's go ahead and get on into the video
alright let's talk about the high-end
products first and then we'll talk about
luxury last so the first high-end thing
that I just I I get the idea but it just
doesn't work I love you benefit though
you know I do but this is just this is
not this is not something I like this is
the benefit they're real big sexy eye
kit and the whole idea of it is like
it's like a little 10
open it up and you have a mirror and you
have three different eyeshadow duos
basically and it comes with this little
a sponge that if you have nails it is
hard to hold for a long amount of time
so that's what it looks like and
basically you just swipe it into here
and then swipe it on your lid I think
it's much easier to use a brush than to
use this I mean these shadows are nice
and pigmented but honestly I just think
you can save your money on this because
you probably already have some neutral
chat you probably already have some
neutral shadows in your collection and
this is just kind of like a gimmicky
thing to me next product is something
you guys wanted me to talk to you about
or literally the longest time it is this
Urban Decay all nighter waterproof
long-wear liquid foundation I've had so
many of you ask me what I think of this
and I don't like it I know everybody
loves this thing but I just don't like
it
I have very oily skin lots of texture
all that good stuff well not good stuff
but you filming this just accentuates my
texture so bad so bad I can't make it
work for me I've tried it multiple times
I've tried with a brush a Beauty Blender
thing for my skin it's just a little too
matte so then it starts situating all
these texture that I have right here
which right here you can kind of see
right now that is accentuated because
I'm trying out another new foundation
this was just really bad and really dry
looking on my skin and I wasn't a fan
okay the next foundation that I do not
like and I have the same issue with this
one is the Chanel latents ultra too new
I don't know I don't know I can never
speak this stuff Ultra wear flawless
foundation this is what it looks like
this foundation is so intense when it
comes to smell it smells like you're
putting a perfume on your face it is
just oh all up in your nose I'm very
sensitive to smells and this is way too
strong for me I could not get through a
full day with this I had to hurry up and
take it off I have the same issue with
this one as I do that over in ak1 it's
just a little too flat matte a little
too drying and really accentuates the
texture I have going on my skin it's
really hard to find things that are
going to make my skin look like
smoothies that are also going to keep me
matte it's kind of hard to find that
perfect foundation with that perfect
combo yeah I thought this would be
really
it and I just did not like it so sorry
Chanel the next step is this Tom Ford
skin illuminating powder duo and I do
not like this at all this one's actually
not bad as you can see right there does
have a really nice glow to it but this
one what happened to this one it's not
good at all it's so sheer honestly no
matter how much you try to build it up
it is just so insanely sheer and I do
not like it I don't know what happened
if both of the formulas were like this
one I could consider liking it but
they're not there just to me they're
just not that great if I'm gonna buy
this palette like see this one looks
painful this one is just lit and for the
price I want these to be absolutely
stunning I want to be going crazy over
them and I just want to be obsessed and
I'm not with this one at all
I feel like you could get other
highlighters that are way better I mean
even wet and wild has that boozy brunch
highlighter that is just stunning and I
don't know I did not like this it just
wasn't worth the money to me the
packaging is gorgeous I love a couple
Tom Ford product but this one was just
one that I was just like man really next
up is this la Prairie bronzer now I love
the lauper a powder foundation I think
it's amazing but I got this in the mail
and I was like who is that going to
bronze and look cute on because I know
it'll look cute on me you can't even
really tell how Orange this is but it is
so orange in person if you have the
chance to go to la Prairie in person and
see this product I recommend you doing
it because it's an interesting color
it's like orange but a red orange but I
want a kind of orange tint bronzer the
limit that I will go to is the mac
mineralize skinfinish and give me son
that one has like a little bit of an
orange warm tint to it but this one is
like 10 times that it's so orange and I
just cannot wear this I can't make it
look natural on my skin the brush is
really nice that comes in it I'll give
them that but I didn't buy for the brush
I brought in front of bronzer so a
little disappointed and that is the same
like packaging as the powder foundation
the same pan size and everything
this is the last foundation I'm going to
mention this is from Lancome oh I kind
of went out of order but oops this is
the Lancome ten Idol Ultra makeup Oh
Ultra wear makeup stick says all-day
where comfort portable perfection
soft matte finish I do not agree with
that soft matte finish whatsoever I
remember the first time I used this I
put it on snapchat and I was like hell
no if you have really oily skin you're
not going to like this it really doesn't
situate everything and it just looks
oily right when you apply it even when
you said it has like a little bit doing
this to it and it just does not feel
good on the skin it feels like you have
a foundation on your face sometimes I
don't mind when a foundation feels heavy
but this I just felt like I could peel
it off of my face I did not like it at
all and this is elastic foundation that
I purchased because after this one I was
like scarred for life
I love the anasazi stick foundations I
think they're cheaper than this one so
try that out before you worked out the
money for this little stick I did not
like it at all it was easy to blend but
it just did not look good on my skin
next up is another product I did not
like before my skin this is a concealer
from Tom Ford this is the oh I don't
know what this is Oh concealing pen
that's all it is and it has a sponge tip
on it reminds me of the Maybelline
instant age rewind and honestly if you
want something like this go buy that one
because that one is way better than this
product right here this is just so thick
but sheer if that makes any sense like
you blend it out it blends out to
nothing but it's real thick and it just
doesn't look pretty on the skin it looks
very cakey it settles into your fine
lines in an instant even if you set your
concealer it still sings into those fine
lines which is and it just does not look
good it looks so bad sorry if you want a
good concealer save yourself some money
because this is hella expensive by the
tarte shake tape the smashbox 24-hour
concealer you could buy the maybelline
better skin seconds lasting this is not
a product problem it's a packaging
problem for me they gets all
kathleenlights mention this too but i do
not like the fact that this blush pan is
so small why why is this so small you
pay so much money for this and like I
couldn't tell you where the brush is
honestly I have no idea where it's at
it's nowhere to be found and this
reminds me of covergirl blushes if I
want a peachy pink blush that's half the
pan I would just go to covergirl and buy
one there and
the finest like what $60 one I don't
even know how much this is but I know
it's expensive
now the outer packaging is so cute and
sleek and very pretty and the product on
the inside is nice it's a nice smooth
create on your cheeks but I just wish
that they made that's the color right
there by the way and this is in the
shade soft peach but I'm just saying
like I wish I would have like made it
bigger you know just made it bigger at
least filled it up about right there
fill up the pan a little bit last thing
I have to show you guys is the Dior show
brow chalk this is in the shade soft
brown this is actually the perfect color
for me and I don't like this because the
formula sucks or anything like that or
the color um that's the color right
there by the way if you're wondering for
soft brown it's kind of ashy which I
love it's just the way that the product
is shaped so it's shaped like this it's
a really thick kind of crayon and you
just can't get like a nice flick with
your eyebrow and you can't get anything
really precise and even when you try to
fill this in it feels like it doesn't
get underneath the hairs on to the skin
to really stick and really fill in those
brows it kind of feels like you have to
sit there for a little while and just
brush it through the way I was starting
to use this was I would take a brush put
my brush in it and put in my brows and I
did like the formula I thought it was
really great I can't tell you if it's
waterproof or not I claim it's
waterproof but I didn't test that theory
out and you also get quite a bit of
product look at that looks like a 2-0 I
just don't like the fact that it's such
a thick crayon you know what I'm saying
like I just can't it makes it a little
bit more difficult when I have to use my
brush to go into this and I just don't
find it easier at all but if you like
thicker pencils like this you would
probably like that I just I can't do it
okay guys so that is it for this video I
