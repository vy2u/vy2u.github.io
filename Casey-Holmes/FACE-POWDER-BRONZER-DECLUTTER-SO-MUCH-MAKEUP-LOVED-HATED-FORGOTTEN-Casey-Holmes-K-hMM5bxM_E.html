decluttering video if you watched my
last decluttering video which I will
link it down below in the description
box if you haven't but I didn't have two
more drawers right here I actually added
these two after I did that first two
cluttering video and this is all new
makeup I wanted something a to kind of
even all these out because there was
like a space missing here so I have two
more big drawers and face products are
the most that I feel like I get in the
mail that are new so a bunch of that is
in here we've got drugstore we've also
got high-end makeup last time we went
through drugstore foundations and
high-end foundations as well as primers
and concealers this is also a new bin
that I created makeup I'm testing out
just so like I have something to pull
and take with me in my desk
if I'm trying out new makeup or things
like that but today we're gonna be doing
the powders and the bronzers and we've
got so many of these so we're just gonna
get right on into it first drawer face
powders high-end so first thing we've
got Laura Mercier translucent powder I
do really like this I think it's a good
powder to have I think I use this for my
wedding day I'm pretty sure I did I am
gonna keep this powder so this one I'm
obviously gonna keep cuz you guys know
I'm obsessed with it it's a Too Faced
peach perfect mattifying the setting
powder I'm obsessed with this even
though it's so messy I love this so
definitely keeping that next we have the
Too Faced Born This Way powder I
actually like the peach perfect powder
more than this one so I'm going to go
ahead and give this one away the cover
FX perfect setting powder I don't really
remember how I feel about this so I'm
just gonna keep it and try it out a bit
more this is a Kat Von D setting powder
in translucent I'm gonna go ahead and
get rid of this I haven't really used it
much it's just you know it's obviously
one that I don't reach for very often we
have the Mac Patrick Starr collection
this is the set powder he came out with
I'm definitely keeping this because I
really like it then we have this
under-eye powder this is the Kat Von D
lock-it brightening powder and petal I
want to try this out again so I am gonna
keep it I do like the shade it's kind of
like a light
peach color this is the Kat Von D
blotting powder and medium I'm just
gonna go ahead and get rid of this I
think I did like this one but I never
use like powders like this really unless
I need it to take with me
and my purse or something and this is
just a little too clumpy for that and
I'll show you the other ones that I
really like so I'm just gonna go ahead
and toss this one same with the Tarte BB
powder I never use it it's a creamy
powder foundation just not my thing I'm
not really into powder foundations so
I'm gonna get rid of that then we have
the Estee Lauder perfecting loose powder
I don't remember how I feel about this
so I'm gonna keep that and try that out
some more we also have the Urban Decay
Velvet Iser I need to use this again I
remember when I first tried it it was
amazing and then I just honestly forgot
about it till literally now that I'm
doing this video it is such a finely
milled powder it is absolutely insane
then we have this clay 2po chunky as f
powder um I think this is a good powder
but I just cannot stay in this packaging
is so chunky it's like what your grandma
would put on her counter to just take up
room you know get rid of this one then
we have these two this is the lemare
powder foundation right yeah this is a
cellular treatment foundation powder I
don't really ever use this product much
anymore so I'm just gonna go ahead and
get rid of that and then there's this
girl on powder that is like a mattifying
powder and I don't know I just never use
powders like this anymore so I'm gonna
go ahead and give that one away as well
a good purge for our first drawer
there's this one is super full the
drugstore one this oh my goodness
first one is the Catrice all matte
powder plus it's a shine control powder
this is the kind of thing that I like to
throw into my purse
something that doesn't really have a
color but it's mattify this one is in
natural beige it kind of gives like a
highlighted effect I like that it's so
slim and compact so I'm gonna keep that
this is the flower Beauty miracle matte
Universal finishing powder I feel like I
need to try this out a little bit more
it is a white powder which I'm not
really the biggest fan of because a
flashback but this
a new product and I'm still testing this
out definitely gonna keep this and then
make up a revolution a luxury baking
powder lace and this is the banana 100%
100% keeping this it's so good then we
have the L'Oreal infallible Pro sweep in
LOC translucent setting powder I'm gonna
get rid of this just because as you guys
can see it's a white powder and I'm just
not a big fan of these they usually
cause flash back and I just never use
this one so I'm gonna get rid of it then
we have this Pacifica was this neutral
mattifier which Harry and minerals vegan
cruelty free I'm gonna go ahead and keep
this this is another powder I like to
just throw my purse because it is slim
so I'll keep that there this is the
essence brighten up banana powder I
really like this powder when I just want
to brighten up my under eyes so I am
gonna keep that it's really good we have
Lee went wild photo focused pressed
powder in a neutral buff I'm gonna go
ahead and get rid of this one just
because I never really use this powder
there's other ones I like more so I'm
just gonna get rid of that covergirl
vitalist healthy powder um I haven't
really tried this one much this one's in
classic ivory but I'll keep it just to
try it out a little bit more I don't
really know how to feel about it so I
don't know if I wanna get rid of it just
yet
you have the NYX no filter finishing
powder I think I really liked this
powder pretty sure it was super smooth
this one's in the shade medium olive so
I think I'm gonna get rid of it though
I'm just gonna get rid of it because I
never use it but I'm pretty sure I did
like this powder this is the such up
buttercup setting powder I'm gonna go
ahead and get rid of this it is a nice
powder but I just feel like one of my
friends will like it more then we have
the flower Beauty powder foundation I'm
gonna get rid of this as well just
because it's not my kind of thing to
have this powder I don't even think this
is the brush that goes with it pretty
sure it's not maybe it is no I don't
think that is so yeah I'm just gonna get
rid of this one because you know just
nothing crazy good
Cody airspun powder I'm definitely gonna
keep this it's like a staple I feel like
in most people's makeup collection it's
a really great powder so I am gonna keep
that Oh
this powder this is the no color powder
by RC ma and I never use this powder
because
the packaging I know you can totally put
it in a different one with a sifter and
all that there's just a lot of work but
I'm gonna go ahead and give this to a
friend see if they like it more and if
they'll put it in a sifter or not
because I never use this one oh I love
this one this is the la girl pro powder
the HD High Definition setting powder
love this this one is in the banana
yellow shade this is really really good
it actually went through one whole one
already it's just awesome so it's
definitely gonna keep this one then we
have the Catrice oh these are two of
them prime and fine mattifying powder
and I'm just gonna keep one of them
because I don't need to it does just
kind of mattify the skin it has a light
peachy tint to it so it's not white or
anything so it is nice we have one away
keep one for myself then we have this
Catrice nude illusion loose powder I
even use this before now I haven't even
used it but it's that white powder again
I'm just gonna go ahead and give this
away because I don't think I'll ever use
that now we have the coquÃ­'s setting
powder in translucent this one does have
a little bit of a tint to it I want to
try this out more and see how I feel
about it because there's really not much
left so I need to use this up and you
know have it as an empty I'm going to
keep this and trying to use it then we
have the Lottie London ready set go a
match hesitant finishing powder again
I'm gonna get rid of this one just cuz
it's not my cup of tea this is the
essence all about Matt fixing compact
powder gonna go ahead and get rid of
that we also have this soap &amp;amp; Glory one
heck of a blot powder I feel like I've
had this one for forever I'm pretty sure
this one's ready to retire so I'm
actually gonna throw that one away and
then same with this models own oh my
gosh this one is old isn't it oh this
one has the pull off lid ooh yeah this
one's pretty old it looks kind of
crumbly anyways master fixed by face
studio again that nice white powder I'm
gonna get rid of that actually I think
that one's very old and then we have the
Maybelline fit me a loose powder oh my
gosh I haven't used this in forever
I think light was pretty dark yeah I
never use this because of the color so
I'm gonna give that one up but I heard a
lot of people really liked this powder
then the last one is
this elf translucent powder pretty sure
this one is very old so I'm just gonna
go ahead and toss that though now we
have a nice little stash of goodies
we're declutter and little by little
guys look at that nice I feel like these
two cluttering videos are great because
it'll help me go through these products
like that cookie powder now I know it's
in here otherwise like when I first had
it in here and it was all stacked on top
of each other I wouldn't dig through it
I would just pick whatever was on top so
now I can really go through some of
these products and decide how I feel
about them if I still love them as much
as I used to now we're getting into
drugstore bronzers this is the hardest
part because I love bronzers and I like
pretty much anyone so we'll see smell
the butter bronzer already so let's just
go ahead and talk about it I do really
love the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer I feel like it's a little too
light for me now I know a lot of you
said there's I know a lot of you said
there's a darker shade out which I
really want to get my hands on this is a
great bronzer if this is your color if
you're a little bit more fair it smells
so good I can smell it every time I open
up my bronzer drawer so I'm gonna give
this to a friend but I definitely want
the darker shade of this these two
already know I'm gonna keep I love the
interesting to keep both shades so we
have medium bronze in deep bronze these
are the Catrice Sun glow matte bronzing
powders these are awesome you guys
they're so smooth they're pigmented easy
to blend and they're like that perfect
bronzer that's just super warm and
pretty on the skin so I'm gonna go ahead
and keep that this is the essence Sun
Club matte bronzing powder this one is
too light for me even though it says
it's for darker skin this is super light
I can't really bronze with it I tried
bronzing with it the other day and it
just wasn't working so I'm gonna go
ahead and give that away I also have
this Catrice prime and find a
professional contouring palette really
love this contour shade I use it all the
time I'm gonna keep that I guess I
really like Treece bronzer so far then
we have the covergirl trublend bronzer I
think I like this I used it in a photo
not too long ago this for your cheeks is
really pretty it's nice and pigmented so
I am going to keep that
also have the Lodi London tan time
bronzer oh my gosh this was like one of
my favorites I totally forgot about this
I even have one of these in my product
refill drawer so I'm gonna try this out
again this one is the light/medium shade
and it looks like a really pretty color
so I need to get back in it this one
oh yes the pole audio matte bronzer I
really like this to contour it is a nice
deep matte bronzer it blends really well
it's very pigmented I like it a lot you
see that so I'm gonna keep that this
one's in nude beach oh my god everybody
used to use this so long ago when there
was like nothing else in the drugstore
that was a good bronzer but now we have
all these options and it's amazing this
is still like a classic product it's the
NYC smooth skin bronzing face powder I
know this is so old it needs to be
trashed I've had this for so long so I'm
gonna go ahead and throw this in the
trash but if you're looking for like a
staple bronzer that everybody used to
love this is your go-to it's kind of too
light for me now but it was a good
bronzer then we have this Physicians
Formula multicolor bronzer I'm gonna go
ahead and get rid of this just because I
don't like the packaging ever really use
this one much and I like the butter
bronzer better so I'm gonna get rid of
that then we have this BH Cosmetics oh
this is very shimmery this is the satin
bronzer it's a lot of shimmer for a
satin bronzer it has a glow to it I'm
gonna get rid of this one just because I
have that covergirl one that has a
little bit of shimmer weight and while
contouring palette oh my gosh do they
even sell these again I forgot about
this this is very old though how long
does last let me see I feel like this is
pretty dang old like I had this so long
ago so I'm gonna get rid of this because
that has to be like super old but this
was really great
there's L'Oreal glam bronze bronzer Wow
I really loved this bronzer I'm gonna
think they carry it anymore it was so
good I think this one's pretty old too
but this one was so nice they need to
come back out with this it was beautiful
so we'll get rid of that stuff we have
this number 7 bronzer I love this
bronzer is so nice this one's in the
shade caramel and it's just a really
great matte bronzer it looks great on
the skin
and I keep it the j-cap Beauty golden
soul baked bronzer haven't really used
this much I'm just gonna go ahead and
give this away this is in the shade 104
Cyprus plays oh my god I used to love
this too this is the wet wild made of
cushion contour oh my gosh I was so into
this when I first got it it's so good
so this is the cushion bronzer I really
did enjoy this product don't really use
the Korean contours anymore they're just
not my thing
prefer powders I usually always have so
I know this is old I'm gonna get rid of
it then we have this one up Beach's
matte bronzer and this is actually
really great bronzer to get it on Amazon
but I'm gonna go ahead and give this to
my friends because I'll probably never
use it since it's not super easy to get
your hands on ELF bronzers oh I loved
these these were so good this one was my
favorite though the caramel cabana this
was a great one to contour with so I'm
gonna go ahead and keep this one but
I'll give this one away cuz I never
really used this it was in beached
brÃ¸ndby a favorite Neutrogena healthy
skin blends in sunkissed this is such a
good bronzer I love this one it dropped
so it broke but I've gone through
multiples of these and I just think it's
one of the best bronzers so we don't
keep that that's what I'm I like go to
so if I don't know what you use I'll use
apps is the Circa perfect picture
perfect powder bronzer and this is a
great one to use the contour you can get
this at Walgreens I'm pretty sure I
don't really use much from this brand
but I'm going to keep this just to try
it out a little bit more this is a
flower beauty light illusions perfecting
powder and I'm just gonna go ahead and
get rid of this I put it in the bronzer
pile because it's definitely too dark
for me to use on my face and this one's
in caramel d1 so I'm just gonna give it
away because I'll probably never use
this as a bronzer then we have this pull
audio mosaic two-in-one blush bronzer
I'm gonna get rid of this I don't really
like stuff like this I prefer either a
blush or bronzer I don't even think I
really use this so I'm just gonna go
ahead and get rid of that last but not
least cream products so the Jordana
sculpt in glow I am going to get rid of
these because like I said I don't really
use cream products anymore
I'm gonna trash this one and then the
one that sealed I will give that one
oh wait oh wait I can see all my
bronzers don't have a divider anymore
it's a good day when you organize all
right we have a drugstore bronzer
palette Oh me okay so this is the
Catrice professional makeup techniques
face palette I do like this palette I'm
gonna keep it because it's not that old
so I'm gonna keep that I specifically
want it just for like these shades right
here so I like it I'm gonna keep it of
this profusion contour palette this is a
nice dupe for the Kat Von D one I am
gonna get keep this as well you can get
that Grant at Target or TJ Maxx I love
this I can't get rid of it this is so
good I got this at t.j.maxx it came with
three different brushes look at how
dirty it is I use this so much I just
love the highlights I love the bronzer
and I'm gonna keep this even though it
is the bulkiest packaging ever I just I
can't get away from it do we have this
blush bronzer highlight palette it's
lifting sculpt from a flower beauty I
love this this is like a go-to palette
something great to travel with they're
all so pigmented very beautiful on the
skin definitely keeping it okay I might
not get rid of a lot in this one again
the Ulta contouring kit this is another
one that I have really put some use in I
love this one especially warmth in a
bombshell bronzer these are great great
bronzers and I'm just not ready to part
with it yet so this is a NYX three steps
to sculpt I haven't used this and so
long I think because this bronzer is
just way too dark for me so I am gonna
go ahead and give this away to a friend
I love this line this is the Physicians
Formula bronze booster for this one you
have a nice cream shade and really
really ashy tone and then a warm tone
and I really love this one so I need to
use this more I'm gonna bring that back
then we have this essence shape your
face contouring palette I really liked
both of these shades I think they're
great
I'm gonna keep that as well then we have
these else bronzer contour palette so
this is the contour palette this one's
the bronzer palette I used to use these
all the time but I don't really use them
anymore and they're really old so I'm
just gonna go ahead and get rid of those
oh my gosh the May
Master bronze I never use this and I
know I never will in the future I did
like it but I just never reach for it
just know something about it I don't
reach for it then we have the models on
sculpt and glow oh my gosh this is huge
I forgot how big this was this is what
it looks like I don't really use this
anymore
I believe I really did like it when I
used it I just think I don't know I
don't use it a lot this is pretty dang
old so I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of
that one then the last one is the BH
Cosmetics sculpting glow I never use
this ever ever ever not for a specific
reason it just doesn't call my name I
mean it is pretty but I just never use
it so we'll get rid of that one as well
have all of our beautiful palettes left
beautiful so much room for more palettes
all right this is the hard part you guys
we have so many high-end bronzers it is
not even funny
right so we have the Marc Jacobs
fantastic Omega bronzer this is the
limited edition one I believe they're
bringing this back for summer I love
this I'm not getting rid of it I'll just
go ahead and say that right now same
with this Tarte Park Avenue princess
this has to be one of the prettiest
packaging like makeup products ever I
love all the bronzer shades I love the
enhance shade right here that more
yellow toned this is just so pretty it
smells like chocolate and I can't get
rid of that also have the pure cosmetics
contour Diaries which I was using for a
while there I don't really use it much
anymore so I am gonna get rid of that
and oh here we go we have this other
Marc Jacobs bronzer this one's the
Mirage filter this is so old time for me
to get rid of it look guys I hit pan on
this that's crazy huh
but once this one came out I was over
this one and the reason why I use this
so much was for that yellow shade so I
am gonna go ahead and toss this because
I just I know how old this is Smashbox
Smashbox we have another section here
okay - Smashbox contour palettes if
these are the same then I'm just gonna
keep one let's see yeah these are the
same exact things so I'm just gonna keep
one of them you really like this bronzer
palette it has a nice little pale yellow
shade a warm tone and an ashy tone this
is just a great browser palette
I love this one so I'm keeping that
k'kaw I don't have not used these in so
long these are really really warm I
don't even remember how I feel about
these so this one is the medium kit and
this one is the light kit I don't see
much of a difference
I bought them to review I don't know
which one did I use the most of I think
the light kit so I'll keep the light kit
but I'll definitely donate the medium
kicks now we have these the balm
cosmetics take home the bronze bronzers
so I've used this one and this is pretty
good to contour with this one is in the
shade I have no idea no earthly idea
what shade this is in I'm just gonna
keep one of these this one has the
packaging on it but there's really no
sense in keeping two so I'm gonna get
rid of that yeah we have the Urban Decay
Naked skin this is the shapeshifter
palette I really did like this palette I
didn't really I mean I use the cream
sometimes but I didn't use them all the
time I'm just gonna get rid of this one
as well because I never use it these are
like popping out already
so yeah I'm just gonna get rid of that
st. Tropez bronzer oh my god I was using
this for a while there cuz I use this so
much I'm gonna keep this because it just
looks like a summer dream and we have
the Chartists contour palette honestly
there's no sense in me keeping this one
if I have that Park Avenue princess
palette so I am going to donate that one
and then this it cosmetics sunshine in a
compact I'm gonna go ahead and get rid
of this one too I never really use it
there must be a reason why but I don't
also don't like the matte packaging it
kind of hurts my teeth I knew that's
weird
but that sound drives me nuts so I'm
gonna donate that as well you guys are
going to flip your shenanigans when you
see this next drawer this is my I would
say this is like one of my least
favorite drawers other than I mean it's
one of my favorite drawers but my least
favorite to go into because it's so
crammed this one in the high end
highlighters one too is very very
crammed and I don't really reach for a
lot of these products and they've been
in here for a while and I know some of
them are really old so uh let's just
let's get to it
front to back stacked ridiculous okay
first things first is this Laura Mercier
I absolutely love this bronzer in
bronzer 3 you have the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer I'm gonna get
rid of this one just because it's a
little too deep for me they did come out
with some more that I have now they
repackaged so I'll just go ahead and
give that one away so I have two hoola
bronzers this one is so old I've had
this since literally I think I started
my channel I'm gonna get rid of this I
know this is expired heat this one
I actually opened it up not too long ago
and even though they sent it in PR a
while back I didn't start using it until
recently so I really love this bronzer
though I think it's great this one is a
Dior bronzer so what it looks like I
don't even remember how I feel about
this I think I loved it
it's the Dior skin nude tan in 0:03
and I'm gonna keep it because first off
this Dior I don't really get rid of it
and it has a year lifespan I'm pretty
sure it's been over a year but I'm just
I'm not ready to part with that I also
have this makeup forever bronzer I never
use this anymore I think I used to
really like it it's the matte bronze in
number 20 I know this has got to be
really old so I'm gonna go ahead and get
rid of that oh my god
rip to my favorite bronzer like honestly
this is such a good bronzer and they
discontinued it I'm so pissed about it
this is the Smashbox bronze lights
perfecting powder and suntan matte they
no longer have this anymore
look I hit pan on this sucker that's how
much I loved it I am gonna get rid of
this one I know this is old but this is
a new one and I'm gonna keep it because
it's one of those products that even
though it's discontinued I'll never
feature it on my channel but it will
totally use this um off camera whether
they say they repackaged it and put it
ba ba ba but I just feel like it's not
the same I don't know why then we have
this Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light
I used to use this one all the time too
this is very old I'm just gonna go ahead
get rid of that but this is a great
bronzer and this was like a staple for
me
now we have this ciate London palm
island of bronzer have I used this a lot
I don't know I don't remember using this
so much it looks like I have I'm gonna
go ahead oh my god I got this all over
my ring I'm gonna go ahead and keep this
and just try it out a little bit more
over here then we have this pure sculpt
palette oh my gosh this why never use it
I hate the packaging yeah I don't really
like this it's like a little mini
palette just not my thing so I'm going
to give that away then we have NARS
Thalia Thalia oh my gosh these I
remember when these were the hot thing
you know I never really used this
anymore I don't ever use these colors
either so I'm just gonna give this I'm
gonna actually throw this one away
because it's broken then we have two
more NARS bronzers in the shade seaside
and Casino I'm gonna Casino not like the
biggest fan of this formula so I'm gonna
get rid of this one and then one a
seaside look like yeah I'm just gonna
get rid of these because a I've never
dipped my brush into them and B I'll
probably never dip them in so oh my god
this one is so good the urban decay
beached bronzer yes please this is such
a great bronzer oh my gosh if you want a
nice golden glow and unless you just
came back from the beach oh my god this
is it I'm keeping it have this Mac
Studio water white powder and this is
just too dark for me this is in dark and
this was a sample from their PR I'm
gonna get rid of this just because I'll
never use it we wanted these hourglass
bronzers I haven't used these and so on
we have radiance bronze light nude
bronze light in luminous bronze light
there's no sense in me keeping the
reading of bronzers I think the one that
I really loved was radiant bronze light
it could be no I don't know I never
really use these and we're scared of all
of them I never use these products ever
I know hourglass is a great brand but I
just never used these bronzers
alright moving on - oh my god three
bronzers again this is ridiculous three
bronzers from Becca we have
some hard names to pronounce sometime
say all of them so here's one of them it
looks like I got some love
that looks pretty so this one's capri CO
so I'm gonna go ahead and keep that one
okay this one's like never used it still
has the little packaging in it so I'm
gonna give that away and then this one
was pretty much never used probably
because it's way too dark for me so I'm
also going to get rid of this as well
keep one out of the three my gosh I used
to love this bronzer The Seeker lawn
terracotta bronzer I'm definitely gonna
keep this because I need to use it some
more this is an expensive bronzer and it
gives you such a gorgeous super super
warm bronzed look not for the faint of
heart if you do not like warm bronzers
this is not the one for you but I really
like warm toned bronzers and I'm gonna
keep that there's a lash in here it
looks like a spider pretty vulgar
bronzer this is what Wow I use this
quite a bit at night
it's pretty vulgar still on Sephora I
don't even know but I've been a long
time since I've used this I don't think
I'll ever really reach for it so I'm
gonna go ahead and get rid of that then
this is another Laura Mercier bronzer in
bronze oh - I am going to keep this for
the times that I am lighter because I'm
not always super soft and so I can use
bronzer three so I'm gonna keep this too
- Victoria Beckham bronzers and prettier
these are the same thing one must have
been from a sample kit and then they
sent me one with the label on the back
these have to be the same exact things
they have - pretty much yeah they're
pretty much the same thing so that's
what it looks like this one looks a
little bit deeper so I'm gonna keep this
one and then I'll just give away this
way now we have this ciate South Beach
bronzer never use this and to be honest
I probably never will because it looks
pretty dark so I'm gonna get rid of that
for that but that packaging is so cute I
love that okay no I'm not gonna keep
this is the Too Faced bronze melting
powder bronzer melting powder bronzer no
no you have this makeup for ever single
contour I'm gonna get rid of this cuz it
just gets lost by itself you know like
with this little media package yeah I'm
gonna get rid of this it's just not like
a must-have product for me
oh my god this stupid bronzer this is
the Lila be sunkissed beauty bronzer
this is the heaviest bronzer ever but it
is so pretty this is expensive too it's
so freakin heavy it is ridiculous how
heavy this is you could not travel with
this unless you wanted your makeup bag
to be like 20 pounds it is very pretty
but I'm just never going to use this I
can't stand the packaging and how heavy
it is I know that sounds ridiculous but
honestly I can't do it so it really lies
then we have the makeup geek Thani
medium skin bronzer also gonna get rid
of this it's just too dark for me
doesn't work so I'll get rid of that
this is a good bronzer this is the Too
Faced sweethearts bronzer and I really
like this one for like a nice kind of
glowy look something that's not too warm
so I'm definitely gonna keep that Wow
