know
and also if you guys don't know I have a
vlog channel I have been vlogging a
little bit more lately and if you want
to check it out I will leave a link down
below in the description box but enough
of all that
let's just get started with this fall
essentials video so first up for fall
you can't bring in fall without new fall
candles and these two I'm about to show
you are my new favorites that I've never
seen before they've probably come out
but I've just never seen them before
this one is vanilla pumpkin marshmallow
oh it's so good usually I'm not a sweet
scent kind of person but this one is
perfect
it says the comforting sweetness of
vanilla combined with what
mouth-watering cloud of pumpkin
marshmallow I usually don't like the
smell thumpkin either like I'm not the
classic girl who loves pumpkin spice
lattes this not me but this smells so
good you need it in your life then this
is a newest favorite I've been burning
this in my room and it smells delicious
it is in a buttercream icing again I'm
not into big sweets but this is this
just smells so good it says enjoy the
sweetest flavors of fall with
mouth-watering fragrance of fluffy
buttercream frosting on top of a just
baked a vanilla cupcake obviously I like
vanilla oh my god smells so good
so buttercream icing definitely check it
out now for my day care I want to talk
about a couple things the first thing
that I have to have during the fall time
is this stress relief by Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works again and this is a eucalyptus
spearmint sugar scrub this is a a
lifesaver like I'm not even joking this
is so amazing if you have really dry
skin and you need something to really
make your skin feel nice and moisturized
right when you get out of the shower
this is what you need in your life is
absolute
I do not go anywhere without this like
if I run out I go straight to Bath and
Body Works and stock up it is a little
expensive at sixteen dollars but usually
they have some deals going on in Bethan
Body Works if you go at the right time
another amazing product or if you have
really dry skin I have like really dry
skin on my body but my face not so much
but this is the luxe Etan ultra rich
body cream in shea butter and I talked
about this so many times on my channel
but that's just because it's amazing
this just makes my skin feel so good
when it's super dry I go to this and
again this one is really pricey but I
promise you it's a miracle worker like
it is absolutely amazing so I wouldn't
use this every day as like your daily
moisturizer unless you really needed it
and then my you know buying it more
often but as one of those like helped me
save my dry skin kind of days this is
what you need in your life I like to
stay tan year-round
and I still use loving tan this is a
deluxe bronzing mousse in ultra dark
like I said before I like the 2-hour one
as well and I have a coupon code for
this if you guys wanna check it out I
don't recommend the mitt that they have
sorry um my favorite mint is by oh my
god I can't remember their name right
now I'll put it in the screen I cannot
remember their name I literally just
drew a blank I've been using the mitt
for like years but this is an amazing
amazing mousse I would definitely check
it out one of my favorites by far it
lasts so long it is so dark I'm just
obsessed with it so loving tan deluxe
bronzing mousse and ultra dark this is
the eight hour one or you could get the
two ever one which is just in dark and
that means it develops in two hours and
that one's amazing as well this one is a
little bit darker but I use both just
depending on how much time I have okay
and then the last body thing is perfume
this is the Miss Dior perfume it just
says in a de parfum I don't know but I'm
obsessed with this for fall now one
thing I will say I have to be so careful
not to spray too much of this I like one
of those people where I watch got that
in my mouth I'm one of those people who
will watch other girls like spray
themselves and
oh my god how did you just do that you
probably smell so strong I go and spend
them and they smell fine go and I spray
like I can't spray more than one spray
on my body of any perfume uh emulous I
can't spray more than like one spray of
perfume on my body because otherwise
it's just gonna smell like so much you
want I mean but other girls can do it
nice smell great I don't know maybe I'm
just self-conscious about being too
powerful of a smell you know what I mean
but this one can be so strong be very
careful with it
I always just spray it and then I like
move my body into it but it is really
good and to me this just smells like
fall so that's it right there I've had
this for a year now this was actually a
gift so I'm really happy about it
okay so for fall one of the biggest
things is lips and I'm going to show you
all my favorite lip colors because I
have a lot so first off let's start off
with Kat Von D or liquid lipsticks I'm
obsessed with Kat Von D liquid lipsticks
I have more back here that I purchased
all in myself I just really enjoy the
line so the first one I'm actually
wearing one right now mixed with a
different shade that I'll tell you about
in just a moment but I love these for
especially for fall so I'm gonna swatch
them for you and then tell you their
names okay so these are the shades that
I really recommend for fall this one is
bow-and-arrow
damned the other one Vampira and double
dare double dare Vampira damned bow and
arrow I'm obsessed with these for fall
these are beautiful beautiful shades I
picked this pinky one right here just
because sometimes during the day you
want something to kind of liven up your
face a little bit but the rest of these
are just I mean fall FA ll right there
another one of my favorites is actually
what I'm wearing right now and it's a
collaboration that a youtuber did and
I'm wearing it with bow and arrow on top
and it is Kathleen lights this is by
Ofra Miami fever this is the shade that
Kathleen created and I'm obsessed with
this I love it it's such a warm rich
shade I don't know this is just so
pretty it's like a orange with like a
hint of brown it's just beautiful and I
love this by yourself and I love it with
bow and arrow non on top
it has a really nice consistency and it
doesn't dry out your lips or anything
like that and of course you can see
helping with today's it's just one of my
new favorite lip colors lately and then
the last liquid lipstick is from NYX
this is the liquid suede cream lipstick
I really like these by the way I dig it
the whole collection and I just I love
them I think they're awesome they dry -
a semi matte finish and they're just
beautiful but this is a classic red this
is in kitten heels right there it's a
beautiful red with an orange base and I
love it
I think it's just the most beautiful
read ever now four lipsticks I have two
from Maybelline that are just my go-to
this one is divine wine I'm pretty sure
this is in a permanent collection I'm so
sorry if it's not but pretty sure it is
that's divine wine right there it's so
beautiful it is a matte shade and then
this one is from their nudes collection
I believe it's still out because when I
just saw it this is in touchable taupe
oh so pretty
so that's such a bull taupe right there
this one is not a match it is a cream
but it is so beautiful on the lips like
I know so many lip products I'm sorry
this is the last one
99.9% of the time if I'm wearing a very
very very very very dark lip color it's
this one this is and this is not it no
where is that that's not the one this is
it what's that and I was like now this
is in blackmail it's in matte shade from
Urban Decay and this is dark but if you
are seeing me with a really deep shade
on Instagram or something like I said
it's this one it's just so beautiful and
sometimes I mix it with Vampira by Kat
Von D's to kind of give it a red tint
but for the most part I'll wear this one
by itself I also have the matching lip
liner and they're just insanely
beautiful together so yes blackmail by
Urban Decay okay so I want to talk about
one blush just because this blush is
like really impressed me and I like it
so much it was sent to me but I'm
obsessed with it and I think it's so
beautiful for fall this is the nightlife
by Camila Coelho I don't know how you
say her last name she did a
collaboration with Sigma and she came up
with this blush it's just a really nice
orange blush I'm is
coming off on camera as orange as it is
but it is a very orange blush and I love
it love it for fall I love it to put
underneath like more pinky toned blushes
I just think it is beautiful for pilots
these are two new pallets I love I've
been using this one constantly since I
broke it out of the packet and I'm so in
love with this one I've been using this
one off-camera one of my shadows
shattered and I just got over the
palette but this is the lorac pro mega 2
palette so I'm so in love with rock
shadows it's just so good you have two
rows of matte shades two rows of shimmer
shades and this just screams fall oh I'm
so in love with it I'm so in love with
this like hunter green right here this
orange color I love everything about
this palette you have any color you will
ever need in this palette I just I feel
like will rock kills it every time with
their eyeshadow palettes and then this
one is just great I think it's a great
essential palette that because it's like
a three in one has so many different
colors in it that you can mix and match
to use so this is the new shape pop
shape by Smashbox shapematters palette
first off look at this mirror so you
have nine eyes shadows here that are
just beautiful
you have to contour shades more of a
cool tone than a warm tone you have a
powder just set your concealer with more
of a shimmery powder and then right here
you have brow products and you have this
which is your wax and how a nifty is
that that they put that on there so
smart I use these as transition shade
sometimes I use of the contour I use I
mean you can use this palette for so
many different things so many different
things do you have brows contouring and
eyeshadow all in one think it's a great
palette to travel with and one thing I
have to say is these are a lot more
pigmented than I thought they were going
to be like they are insane but they
blend beautifully I have all of the
shadows on my eyes today are from this
palette and I just am so in love with
them like look at that they are
beautiful that black is not doing it any
justice because it is a very opaque
black I mean
so opaque that's what I have on my eyes
but I would have to say it's the easiest
black to blend out like it is so freakin
good I love that palette so much
definitely check it out if you just want
something that is a staple and that you
can use for multiple purposes this is
like your go to okay so the last thing I
want to talk about is fashion items
first fashion item is just like classic
boots or combat boots I have a lot of
combat boots that's just been my style I
love combat boots so much these boots I
actually bought last year
these are Tory Burch I forget the name
of them but they're Tory Burch and I
invested in these and I feel like they
look so amazing and I'm gonna wear these
out again this year I wore them out so
much last year I explode on them because
I knew I would wear them a ton and
they're really great quality great
leather and I just love the detail of
this in the front it's just a classic
boot if you find a boot that's like a
little pricey but you know you're gonna
wear it out
I just think by it I mean life is short
by boot and let it hit you in the face
you know
then for vests I will still be in the
fur vest this year this one is one of my
favorites is from Zara this wasn't that
expensive at all but this one also has
pockets in the front like hidden oh I
just love this I love this with a
long-sleeve shirt I was wearing with
those boots a lot and I just found them
I love fur vests so faux fur vests are
the way to go up steps and then for
coats and jackets and things like that I
really started branching out into more
like trenchcoat type things I believe
that's what you would call this like a
trench coat I might be wrong I don't
know this is a blush color jacket I
would say to trench I might be wrong but
it's highs at the waist and it is very
very long I just love stuff like this
because I think it's classic and if you
care we use this every single year and
this is like super heavy it's kind of
giving me a workout holding it up but I
love it so much I think it's a beautiful
jacket this is from misguided and I love
it so jackets like this that are kind of
like a trench coat whatever I think are
just gonna be a simple for me because
you can wear them with literally
anything a super casual out
or really dress the outfit okay guys so
that is it for my fault essentials video
I really hope you enjoyed it
these are all of my essentials for sure
and that I'll be using a ton during fall
yeah I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
