today I have a fall clothing haul for
you I have some affordable pieces I have
some stuff from Free People and I feel
like I have a less alive mmm so I have
some affordable pieces to share with you
guys I also has a I also have a couple
things from Free People
I love free people especially during the
fall they're just amazing um I'm having
this black coffee that I got from Kroger
and I feel like my mind is just all over
the place like I am wired and I just
can't I can't pinpoint my mind to like
one thing you know what I'm saying yeah
I got this black coffee there's no milk
in it just water and coffee it's already
pre-made so I put it in the fridge and
then I put in this so I have like my
iced coffee without having to make iced
coffee so I have some stuff for
misguided Windsor Free People in a so-so
I think those are my three places that I
got things I'm just gonna get started
this isn't in any particular order I
literally just have them stacked right
here I'm gonna try to get through pretty
quickly because I don't wanna be here
for too long this is a try on haul so
you guys will see it on my body I do
like all these pieces when new clothing
items come in I always try them on if I
don't like them they go right back so
this first piece is from misguided this
is a sweater I actually got this in this
gray like this blue grey color and also
a cream color because I love it so much
I adore this neckline I just love how it
lays on my neck I think it's so gorgeous
I love the fact that it's a high up
neckline but it's not a turtleneck so it
still keeps you warm but it's not like
choking you don't get me wrong though I
love turtlenecks but I choked every time
I wear them really like this I think
it's so gorgeous it's really really
comfy it's a nice thicker fabric and it
does have like little splits on the side
which I love so you can wear leather
leggings or you can wear really nice
denim underneath it and it'll just pop
through right here which i think is
super nice this next piece some people
are gonna be like why did you buy that
you can make that yes you could make
this I saw it on ASOS and I remember
seeing a blogger talk about this and I
believe it's in the fro I absolutely
adore her she's stunning and I love her
ASOS hauls so I believe this is the one
she talked about maybe not exactly but
it's kind of similar this is a denim
jacket like I said from ASOS and I
in a UK 8 and it's an oversized fit so
this is what it looks like it's a
destroyed denim jacket which i think is
so cool to always go to like the
goodwill buy a denim jacket and just
destroy it like this I can't wait to
wear it I think it's so fun and so cool
definitely be seeing that on my blog
very soon and my Instagram this next
piece is from Windsor I'm obsessed with
either t-shirt dresses or sweatshirt
dresses you know like the hoodie
material when they're longer I'm loving
them so much with thigh high boots I
just can't get enough but I love the
color of this t-shirt so you could also
throw some leather leggings under this
or something to make it just a t-shirt
but I really do like that you can
transition this from fall to summer
because you could wear this t-shirt
dress in their summertime as well it's a
really nice material super soft and this
was 2690 I feel like it's a little bit
pricey but I appreciate the fact that
it's not see-through
so I'll pay extra money to make sure
it's not see-through
I don't really dress to have things
super form-fitting I like things to be a
little bit baggy a little bit edgy I
mean of course I'll wear like a tighter
t-shirt or a bodysuit sometimes but I
love boyfriend jeans I've been loving
them for a while now and I love kind of
like baggy err stuff so that's kind of
you're going to see in this haul this
next dress I actually got from Free
People as well and I've already posted
this on Instagram and this is what it
looks like it's just this really
gorgeous dress I love it I need to get
it in all the colors I just think it's
stunning like a smell my perfume is
smell so good here it has this gorgeous
overlay in the front you'll see when I
tried on and I just love it it is the
comfiest dress I think I've ever
purchased it's just so easy to wear I
just paired it with some thigh-high
boots and I was out the door
I did wear a Victoria Secret lace bra
lit underneath it just because it is so
low-cut so I did wear a little bra
underneath it just so if something slid
this way you wouldn't get like a nip
slip
and then again from misguided this is
the same sweatshirt as the blue gray
knit that I showed you earlier this is
just the cream version I either have
this blog post up where it's coming
where I was wearing a sweater dress and
a jacket like this but it was in black
and I was from whitefox boutique but I
found this one it looks
like it is from misguided and I adore it
I don't have anything this color and
this color is everything I need I love
it I just cannot wait to wear this with
different looks this is just a staple
jacket it's super long I'm loving the
longer jackets right now especially with
the sweater dresses I just think they
look so good together just in love with
them guys I'm in love with them I got
the same shirt but in two different
colors from misguided excuse me there we
go
basically it's a bodysuit and it's an
off-the-shoulder bodysuit and then this
little neck thing comes behind the back
and this comes around to the front and
ties around your neck kind of like a
choker I just thought it was cute I
thought it'd be great for videos or date
night and it is a thong a bodysuit which
is really nice so you don't have like
that panty line kind of look when you
wear denim or whatever you want to wear
and then I got that same exact top in
this color this next piece is from ASOS
I have a shirt that's kind of like this
but it's not identical this one's
definitely a little bit thicker so again
this has a same high neckline that I'm
really liking it's just a little sweater
like this and it goes all the way down
it is a high-low it's a little bit
longer it's not a full sleeve it's more
of a 3/4 and I love this I think it's so
cute with some boots and some leggings
tops like this with a lot of lines and
stuff going on I love to wear like
leather leggings with this or faux
leather leggings I don't have like any
real leather leggings just put that out
there this cute little top I just had to
have I thought it was just adorable I
don't know it's from Free People it's
got that white like cheetah print or
something I don't know it's again
destroyed as well does have like an open
neckline I really like that a lot you
can just wear with a bralette and be
good to go
has the puffed sleeves and it is a
high-low very very soft that same kind
of Free People material it's really
squishy and it just it feels really good
on the body this piece I have two again
the same color this is from Windsor so
this is a gorgeous sweater dress that
you can kind of wear different ways you
can wear it like as a turtleneck type of
you could wear it off the shoulder it's
just gorgeous it's kind of just like a
staple for fall so I had to get one in
black by the way these are really nice
as well they're not see-through
whatsoever they're not like a really
thin material they feel really nice and
soft and warm this is something that you
could definitely pair underneath a
thicker jacket and you wouldn't be
uncomfortable then I got it in this like
tan beige color I really really like
this a lot next up we have a staple
pieces from misguided I really just
needed another piece like this again it
has that really nice neckline that I
love that sits right here at the nape of
your neck is that like the nape of your
neck basic top it's a crop top it is a
long sleeves but I love tops like this
for pretty much any time of the year
I don't really stick by the role of no
white after Labor Day because I think
white is one of the most gorgeous colors
to wear in the fall in winter and one of
those people that wears white after
Labor Day that's just cause it's so damn
cute I can't help it okay this set I'm
in love with this was something I knew I
just had to get it because I needed to
wear it I fell in love with it so this
is a two-piece set I used to be so in
love with two-piece sets I think it was
last year it's kind of hard for me to
find like a fall two-piece set that I'm
really loving and just lusting over so
this one's from ASOS and it has that
high neckline again this is kind of a
crop top but it's not too cropped it
does go a little bit below your belly
button it's a really nice material it's
nice and thick and it is almost a full
sleeve it kind of this nice band right
here by the way I'm usually a size 26 27
it just depends on what the fabric is
like and I got a size 10 and these
bottoms and they fit really nice so
these are more like Capri style so right
now these are perfect they also kind of
flare out as well and it's not too cold
here in Georgia it's actually pretty hot
it's like in the 80s still so I could
wear I could get away with wearing this
when it gets like low 70s but it also
has pockets and honestly you guys this
is like one of my favorite sets that I
got because I'm just gonna feel like
such a grown-up when I wear this these
jeans are my first pair of jeans that
I've ever purchased from misguided and I
really
them they're a little bit more baggy in
the light crotch area but I actually
don't really mind it they fit nice like
around the weight and I love the front
of them so much that I just like can't
get away from them you're like mom jeans
slash boyfriend jeans that that makes
any sense
the boyfriend jeans I have there where
all the time are from Joe's jeans and
they fit so well that's probably the
only brand that I've ever found like the
perfect pair of boyfriend jeans from
they are pricey but I wear them
constantly so I just get my money's
worth out of them but I found these and
I really do like them like I said a
little bit bigger the crotch area but
it's nothing you know it's not that big
of a deal to me I don't really care and
then this last piece as well as from
misguided I really love the sweater
dress I think it fits perfectly it's
just in this tan color and it's like a
cable knit sweater just regular you know
nothing too crazy I don't know it I just
find it so flattering when I wear it I
just feel really pretty and I really
like it a lot and it's comfy and I have
two pairs of shoes and they're both from
Windsor I did order some boots but I
keep ordering my boots in a size 6 for
some reason I'm a size 8 but the last
for pair of boots that I have ordered
online when they've come in they've been
a size 6 and I swear I'm putting 8 in
there but somehow it goes to 6 I don't
know then
these two like I said are from Windsor
store and I am obsessed with this style
of shoe right now I think these are so
stinkin cute I just cannot get enough of
them I love the height on these booties
they just cover that perfect amount of
your ankle like a little bit above the
ankle and it looks so flattering with so
many different kind of tops and this
plain nude just looks stunning
on your feet it looks just seamless and
you look taller and I love it it's just
so fun and I can't say enough good
things about it and then these are last
paragraph from Windsor thigh high boots
I'm loving thigh highs I tried Stuart
Weitzman boots I tried one pair they did
not fit around my thighs I like leg days
a lot I work out my legs a lot and my
quads are kind of big so whenever I
order the Stuart Weitzman ones they
would not fit over
like the beginning of my knee even
though I would love a pair of Stuart
Weitzman boots I just get too lazy don't
want to go in store and try them on but
I know that the boots that have this tie
here in the back fit my leg perfectly I
found that out through buying these
affordable ones and I just loved it they
fit so well so every time now I have to
buy ones that have the tie on the back
just so they're a little bit wider in
the thigh area just got these from
Windsor as well I really love the color
I don't have anything like this this is
in the shade taupe this is like a faux
suede and I just love it I think it's so
cute hi hi boots are my thing again this
