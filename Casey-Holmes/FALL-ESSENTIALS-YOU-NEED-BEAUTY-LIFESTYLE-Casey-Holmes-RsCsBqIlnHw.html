today we are going to be doing something
a little bit different and I was
thinking about this actually just today
I haven't thought about this forever I
miss like essential videos like fall
essentials fall favorites like you know
seasonal favorites items that people
already know that they love and just
want to recommend have a dead one since
I lived in my old house and I believe it
was like the year before last it's been
so long since I've done like a seasonal
favorites video like things that I know
work that I love um new scents like
candle scents that I love I have some
lifestyle we have makeup in here we also
have skincare we just got a bunch of
different things and I figure we could
kind of throw it back a little bit old
school kind of I don't know is this old
school to you guys I feel like it is and
talk about some favorites and
incorporate some lifestyle in there I
hope you guys enjoy this if you do then
I will definitely continue to do more of
these I do have a blog channel where you
guys get to see like a lot of like me
super raw no makeup and talking about a
lot of favorites that I have
lifestyle-wise on there as well and next
video should be scented beauty review I
know everyone has been talking about
Fancy Beauty actually have a foundation
on now
I've been trying these products out so
just stay tuned I will let you know what
I think on Sunday but anyways enough
about that I'm gonna go ahead and get
started with my fall essentials and as
always if you guys are not subscribed
already be sure to hit that subscribe
button so you don't miss out on any
video I post three times a week and I
love fall so if you love fall 2 then we
can be best friends if you're interested
then let's just go ahead and get started
ok so let's talk about makeup first I
think you know this is a makeup base
channel so we might as well start with
bases and stuff like that first so I'm
first going to talk about foundations
and stuff like that and I'm not gonna go
into too much detail on every single
item because I have talked about quite a
few these products before they're just
my favorites but I feel like these will
be really great for fall slash getting
into winter but here's some of my favs
for fall so the first one is the
hourglass advantage stick foundation
this is a really intense full coverage
foundation and I think this is great for
the fall time because it's kind of cling
down if
like me you have oily skin this does get
pretty shiny on me in the summertime
because my oils I'm a sweaty girl you
know they just they don't mix together
and this tends to get pretty oily on me
throughout the day so I don't normally
wear this out and about a lot but during
the fall and winter I think this is
essential I especially don't know how
the weather's gonna be on my skin this
year I feel like my rosacea is gonna go
kind of a little crazy cuz it's gonna be
so cold but we will see I am definitely
gonna be using this foundation since I'm
going to want a little bit more moisture
now that fall and winter are coming
winter is coming this amazing covergirl
vitalist healthy elixir foundation I
love this this is a medium to full
coverage more full coverage on me and
this gives you a gorgeous glow but if
you have oily skin it's not something to
be scared of don't mind my nails I'm
sorry it really doesn't make you greasy
it just gives you a beautiful glow and
you set it with powder it will mattify
it I find that this lasts a long time on
my skin I have talked about it many
times before and I just think it's one
of the best and I really feel like I'm
gonna be utilizing this so much at the
end of this year let's talk about
eyeshadow palettes I think you already
know the tones I'm going for for this
video because this fall so warm tones I
have two drugstore and then three
high-end palettes so I'll talk about the
high-end palettes first this is a new
favorite that I've been really loving I
did a full review on this collection
just a few days ago so if you're
interested I will leave it down below
but the Too Faced Just Peachy mattes
palette I think is such a great palette
for at this time of year I mean it
screams ball to me
I don't know about you but this looks
gorgeous love all the mats I do love a
nice super deep matte look for fall and
I think this is such a great palette
it's one of those things that I have
been going to a lot and I even took it
with me traveling I love this and I
highly recommend it for this time of
year if you want to spend some money
then I highly recommend the Natasha
denote a sunset palette again this is a
really great fall palette I mean oh my
gosh this palette gives me so many
different feels so this is giving me
like Thanksgiving kind of dinner vibes I
don't know about you but a lot of these
tones are like this one this one this
looks like melted butter it is more on
the pricey side so it's not necess
but if you would like to splurge I think
this is a great palette and you will not
be disappointed you want something kind
of like in between the two faced and the
Natasha de Nona then the Sephora Pro
warm palette is amazing you have so many
different shapes to choose from again
this has given me the same kind of vibes
that that one is these so blend really
well they still look beautiful on the
eyes and you get a lot of shades in this
palette so if you want kind of
in-between Road this is a great one
because the two-faced one is all mattes
the Natasha do not know one is kind of a
mixture of shimmery mattes and this one
is again a mixture of shimmer and mattes
but also the price point is in between
the twos this is a really great palette
if you're looking for something warm
drugstore we got another warm palette
this is the elf maid format - this is a
really great all matte palette as well
from the drugstore I love this pop of
purple right here it's just a really
great kind of everyday transitioning
into the nighttime palette I love it so
much they also came out with another one
whenever I was in New York City with elf
this past weekend they have one I forget
what it's called but it has like really
pretty blues in it and like greens I
highly recommend that one - that one's
more cool toned and it is stunning I did
a first impressions on this palette and
I really enjoyed the look that I came up
with this is the city mini palette and
Shayla collab from Maybelline I just
think these are so freaking pretty again
with the purple and then you have a
really deep kind of burgundy brown shade
a little bit more Brown and you have a
black you have a cream I mean this is
just such a great all-in-one palette so
I have three different blushes to share
with you guys the first one is a staple
in my collection this is madly by NARS I
actually have it on right now and I
really enjoyed this color it's like one
of those perfect nude mob shades that
goes with absolutely anything and then
for drugstore we have the ultimate blush
in the shade princess this one is just
so pretty and again one of those shades
that looks great with almost any look
and it is a matte blush which i think is
awesome doesn't accentuate pores and
then if you're looking for something
more Mavi this flowerpots powder blush
is just from the brand flower beauty's
and then shades sweetpea and again this
is a little bit more on the mob side so
if you like more mathy blushes you'll
really like this you're still like nice
wash of it you know what I mean
not necessarily a cool tone lover but if
I do wear more of a cool tone look this
is the blush that I'll go for and I feel
like it's great for fall and winter for
lip products we've got something first
thing that is actually a trend right now
is metallic lips and I'm loving the
metallic lip trend believe it or not but
I like them in like the gloss form I
think they're really cool so these two
shades I feel like I'm gonna get a lot
of use out of
we have Venus and this is from the ciate
what's it called liquid chrome line so
again this one's in the shade Venus and
then we also have nova which I feel like
is gonna be essential for me so it's
like a golden orange when I'm looking at
it but then the reflex are like kind of
pink and Mabi
um if you're looking for really great
brands that have darker shades I
recommend the wet and wild cat suit
liquid lipsticks these are really pretty
as well this one is in the shade video
vixen it's like a really deep purple so
that's it right there that's a really
great dupe Fleur the Mac liquid lip do
they just use in my first fall makeup
look you need a classic red for fall do
we not because people are wearing
flannels you just want like a nice kind
of easy eye and a red lip this is
perfect this one is in Missy and fierce
it's like that really true red that you
can't go wrong with by the way these two
do dry down matte but look at how
beautiful that is
Palladio is Velvet Matte lip e's are
amazing this is one of my favorite
colors it is in the shade raw silk oh my
gosh this is a great like deeper nude
for the fall time so there it is it is
more on the mob side as well but it is
so pretty I love pull audio for lip
products they have some amazing ones as
well as a Lottie London this is a really
great brown shade and it is in the color
hey BAE
so there's a nice kind of taupey brown
for you if you want to rock a brown lip
next I want to recommend this cookie
liquid matte powder it's just a liquid
lipstick and it's in the shade rosewood
this is a really really really great
product as well really great formula
this is a nice transition Oh kind of my
shirt this is a really nice transition
lip color because it's not too deep and
it is a little bit more Mavi pink so I
like this one as well I find that it
looks
little bit darker on my lips when I
apply it but it is a really great
formula okay so moving on to skincare
now I have a couple things I just want
to share with you
exfoliating your skin is really
important in the fall time because it's
starting to get a little bit cooler you
need to get that dead skin off and this
has been one of my favorite exfoliators
for the past few months now it's the
body shop tea tree squeaky-clean scrub
this is really great for it my super
sensitive skin it doesn't make me more
red or irritated anything like that and
I do find that it really exfoliates and
gets my skin nice and smooth so I love
this and it has tea tree in it you can't
go wrong you're looking for something
that is gonna hydrate your skin really
intense like over night this is what you
need I got back from New York City the
other day and I was like oh my god my
skin is so drive and traveling so much
and I put this back on because I love
this it's one of my go-to is for like my
skins feeling really dehydrated it's the
philosophy take a deep breath night and
it's oil free it's a detoxifying gel
balm and this is really great because
it's that one product that I will use by
itself and I just lather it on it smells
really good and it really does put so
much moisture back into my skin like my
skin feels so much more fresh and plump
the next day and I really love this
product I've been using it quite a bit
it smells really good too it's a really
refreshing scent I'm down quite a bit I
don't think you guys can see how much
I'm down but looking for something
that's going to really hydrate your skin
overnight this is one of my favorite
product so this lotion for your body is
pretty much key because in the fall in
winter I get the most dry legs I've ever
had in my life and this repairs them I
talked about it on my channel many times
before but I just want to give it a
quick shoutout again it is more on the
pricey side but wow it is life-changing
life-changing you can feel this to the
next day it's amazing it's the luxe Etan
ultra rich body cream this honestly
repairs my dry legs like instantly it's
one of the best I'm almost out I'd have
to repurchase another one can you see
that mm-hmm it's amazing I love it so
much and it just adds so much moisture
back into my skin that I need especially
if I'm gonna be self-tanning during the
fall and winter time
I have to be nice and moisturized and
like get my skin prepped for that so one
of the best of the best
speaking of self-tanner i'ma just real
quickly let you know when I recommend
and it is the loving tan deluxe bronzing
mousse in ultra dark this gets me the
self tan that you see now this is
actually a few days later on like three
days after I applied this and I still
have a really nice tan going on I
recommend it I have a code if you guys
want to use it down below in the
description box that gets you a free
little gift guys now I've talked about
this many years if you go check out my
spring essentials from way back when I
talked about this cuz I love it I
haven't been able to get away from it
I've tried new ones none of them compare
so now I'm gonna go ahead and talk about
candles that I love and then I will go
on to fashion and we will wrap this up
so that the Body Works has to be one of
my favorite places to get candles they
are not the most affordable but I highly
recommend waiting till they have a sale
to get two candles don't pay what is it
twenty four fifty
no wait till they're half off and then
you can go crazy and then sign up for
like the coupons and stuff and you eat
like 20% off and all two other kinds of
thing here are my favorite scents this
one is my favorite and has become
Davis's favorite as well because we just
love how this smells this is a fall
night in a freakin candle and it's
called marshmallow fireside this is
probably not a surprise to many of you
it's sweet but it's not too sweet I'm
not the type that can do a super super
sweet scent it can just be too much and
give me a headache this is sweet but
it's it's also toned down as well it's
toasted marshmallow smoldering woods
fire roasted vanilla and crystallized
amber so here are a couple other sins
that they came out with this year that I
really love as well this one's the scent
vanilla Burch just good this also smells
this is like a fall candle this isn't a
winter candle in my opinion it's
definitely smells more fall and it's a
white birch bark madagascar vanilla and
a warm sandalwood I have noticed that I
really like sandalwood and vanilla no no
I really like this it smells delicious
another one I love is chestnut and clove
and it says the fragrance notes are
roasted chestnut clove buds pine cedar
wood and velvety moss
I'm not a big fan of pine this smells
good there's not much to it like pine
wise all of the scents that are all of
the notes that are in here it's kind of
like a little dabble of each and it all
creates that perfect fall scent this is
again another fall set in my opinion not
necessarily a winter one and then we
also have cinnamon spiced vanilla when I
heard this I for sure thought I was not
going to like it this to me smells like
ginger snaps and I love ginger snap okay
so now we're gonna move on to some of my
favorites for fall fashion so one of my
favorite things to wear is thigh high
boots 100% and I have to have the thigh
high boots that tie because my sides are
a little bit bigger and I even tried who
was it Stuart Weitzman boots I tried to
purchase some of those but my thighs
were too big so you know I'm not I'm not
really crying about it because that's
money I'm saving and I can buy more
affordable boots that actually fit my
legs but I definitely have to have the
tie ones those are my favorites and it
also am a big foodie person I got these
last fall from forever 21 and I really
really like them just a really cute
booty to have and I love this color I'm
always looking for the perfect like
taupe brown nude boots I always have
black boots on hand I've currently been
looking for all of boots like crazy I
actually found the perfect pair of
olives boots online and they were sold
out and I've looked everywhere so I'm
just casually gonna wait because I need
all of the boots to go with my camo and
other all of items that I have for fall
but I really do like booties is also
thigh highs and booties
those are my go-to it's all fashion I'm
gonna go through this really quickly one
of my favorite things to wear in the
fall as well is floral I love wearing
floral in the spring and summer and I've
been seeing a lot of like fall floral as
well kind of like this this is from
forever 21 I love this I wore it in a
video that you guys will see pretty soon
I love stuff like this look at how fall
that is it's super pretty again showing
that fall floral with this dress how
pretty is this like a dusty rose color
with these like fall shades on it again
this is from forever 21 I love
this dress on girl and then another
thing I'm loving is olive all of it's
been one of my favorite colors and I
really like this skirt as well this is a
new purchase that I got from forever 21
I love the lace-up details right here
this with a really cute like cream
sweater and some thigh-high boots you
are done another essential that I have
to have in the fall time is sweater
dressing I really became obsessed with
sweater dresses last year and I just
there's something about them they're so
easy to wear you don't have to wear
jeans and I love them so this is a new
one that I purchased again from wow
these offer this is from forever 21 as
well and this is what it looks like kind
of has that bar so you look to it and
then it has stitching here all the way
down the side so what I will do with
this is wear a slip underneath it and I
got mine in size small but it's really
cute it just has ties here on the end as
you can see and this with thigh-high
black boots girl
this trend which is a trend that comes
around every single year like no matter
what the season is I've just now started
wearing these and I am in love I have
two that are they're high in denim
jackets but I will probably not purchase
any more because they're all I need in
my collection I have one that's kind of
fun and funky with like pearls and
little crystals all over it and then I
have this one which is from rails that I
love I think it's the perfect color for
me I throw this over a t-shirt and black
leggings it's a little bit more on the
longer side as well so it covers your
but it's not too distressed I have found
that I don't really liked super
distressed jackets I just don't find
them super practical I gotta know you
guys have seen them - it's like the
jackets that have the like ripped backs
I mean there's nothing on the back it's
pretty much just ripped I can't do those
but I love this one again this is one
that I splurged on I got it in the
medium from Nordstrom it's from the
brand rails and I really like it it's
comfortable it's thick and it keeps me
warm very last thing I want to mention
to you guys I love anything fluffy I
kept a lot of my fluffy stuff out of
this video because I figured out a
weight and you guys would just see me in
it because they are so fluffy I have
like a lot of fluffy jackets and
everything
but this little cardigan is the perfect
transition piece for fall so when it's
getting a little bit more chilly or like
you go into the grocery store and you
know you're gonna freeze your ass off in
the freezer section this is perfect I
got this whenever Nordstrom was having
their anniversary sale I would still pay
full price for these because they are
awesome I have to say whenever the sale
was going on I watched so many like
Nordstrom anniversary sale haul was
addicting and I bought so much and
I for sure thought people were just
hyping this brand up because everyone
talked about it and I was like there's
no hey that cardigan that looks like
poop online is that amazing but no you
get it in and it is so pretty I love
this color I have it in this one in
black I got em in an extra small/small
it has some weight to it but it's so
soft it's like you're wearing a robe
when you go out and again it is longer
so you can wear it with leggings and
cover your butt it has pockets I just
wore my black one the other day to
Urgent Care getting my blister checked
out it's a whole nother story but yeah I
really love this so much it is just as
soft as everyone says it is they ain't
lying to you like I thought you know
sometimes you're like okay okay no this
is amazing
and I highly recommend it and I think
the very last thing I want to share with
you is my favorite fall scent it has to
be Gucci Guilty every time I smell this
scent I think a fall it's just a fall
scent I used to wear this when Davis and
I first started dating too and it just
gives me memories I love the scent so
out of all the ones that I have I was
like this is it this is just that full
essential I have to have is actually it
for my fall essentials fall favorites
whatever you want to call it this is
probably so freaking long but I hope you
guys enjoyed it because I had a lot of
fun filming it and talking about some of
the things that I'm gonna have to have
for this coming up season or you guys
again so much for watching let me know
down below in the comments what your
fall must-have is for this year and I
will see you all in my next video bye
Yama music
