a fall clothing haul I do these clothing
hauls annually I think I did a spring
one day actually I don't think it is a
spring one but I've done a fall clothing
haul I usually I used to do these like
annually rhabdo clothing haul but I
haven't done one in a while
and every year every season I go through
my clothes and I get rid of them I
either take them to the consignment shop
or I will donate them it's just a way
for you to kind of declutter and clear
things out even with shoes I've actually
cleared out a bunch of different shoes
that these are gonna replace I do not
need anymore of these clothes but I save
up to splurge on clothes and I save up
to you know treat myself when a new
season comes around because of course
new trends happen and you just want to
try them out so I figured I would show
you guys what I got today and we'll try
them on for you I will have a little
side panel for you guys so you can check
them out let's just go ahead and get
started so I'm gonna start with on the
shoes I got I know I don't leave any
more shoes but I'm sorry I just I have
to have them sometimes so these are from
Windsor and these are the burgundy heels
they're in a size 8 and what they look
like I just like the Caged effect and I
love the color of these I don't have any
heels like this I love it I love it I
love it I just think they're classic and
they're really never gonna go out of
style
and I like the bottom of them so yeah
again these are from Windsor I don't
remember how much they wore but winter
is pretty affordable so you can always
just check them out for that kind of
stuff and then these are from Windsor is
well I liked the color of these because
again I don't have anything like this
but they're just little boots like this
and they're all one brown shade which I
really like and raise it up on the side
they tie in the front and I think these
are just a great casual bootie to have I
also purchased quite a few pairs of
shoes from Zara
just because Zara always seems to kill
it with the shoes so this first pair is
a really cute black boot I have a couple
pairs of shoes from Zara they last
really well and they're actually really
great quality instead of going out and
splurge eing like a lot of money on some
other boots but these are from them they
said
here at the top and this is actually how
you get in and out of the boot which I
thought was really interesting because
usually zippers like this or just accent
zippers but this one is functional this
is actually when you put your foot in
there so I really like these these were
kind of expensive yeah they're kind of
expensive but again these are with the
classic boot that you can wear with
anything so got those from Zara another
pair of problems Zara I just got my
nails done today so they're like I'm
trying to use to them and I'm pre
filming a bunch of video so okay so
these oh I love you guys I forgot about
these these are just a nice nude heel
again for fall I like to wear caged
heels in the fall time when it gets to
the warm winter months I don't wear them
as much just because my feet are
freezing
but for fall I definitely wear things
like this and I love nudes because they
just go with everything and these have a
nice padding to them and I love the
pattern of these caged heels like these
are just my favorite and again these can
be used year-round so not just for fall
but for spring/summer
okay maybe not winter but you know the
other season trying to justify my
purchases
okay these are definitely interesting
but I love them they're kind of a yellow
light mustard color bootie and I this is
so unique to me to have nothing like it
and it's kind of that suede texture it's
this right here again is the functional
part where you can get in and out it's
not just an accent zipper and I really
like it I like the gold zipper and I
like to heel I like that the heel is the
same color as the boot I think this is
just gonna be a fun way to add a pop of
color or a pop of texture into a look
for the most part I try to get things
that I don't have like this this is a
boot from Zara this is what it looks
like I don't have any boots this color
and I really wanted a pair again they
kind of have like that suede texture to
them I don't know if it's suede but
these are only 70 bucks and I feel like
they look more expensive with this strap
detail right here and this like embossed
symbol in them I don't know what that
symbol means but I just think these look
a lot more expensive than what they were
so I wanted to snatch them up because
this is a great everyday boot
and it's just really cute I just I love
riding boots and I love that these are
knee highs so ya got these from Czar as
well they are beautiful so all these
shops I'm about to mention to you guys
are my favorite sites to go on I do most
of my shopping online so these are my
favorites revolve clothings on my
favorite sites it is a little pricey so
I don't purchase like a ton from there
just because I feel like spending the
money but this top is from revolve it is
from a lot al Li ATT and yeah it's a
size small it's white its kind of flowy
it has a nice band at the bottom and
then the back is kind of see-through you
can't really see on camera I feel like
but the back and the arms are kind of
see-through you can see right there and
I just like this I like creams during
the fall and winter I think cream is a
beautiful color I know people say oh you
can't have white after Labor Day but I
break that roll every year because I
love white so I really don't care these
clothes aren't really in order so I'm
sorry but I'll try to keep them gathered
together but this is from ASOS actually
wear this on snapchat the other day and
then I got my protein shake spot on it a
little bit so I couldn't film with it
but I love this it's kind of like a
pumpkin color with a cream and this is
just a really cute turtleneck crop top
and I just love like turtleneck crop
tops right now I'm feeling a lot more
comfortable with my body so I've been
wearing stuff like this and I think it
looks really cute with high-waisted
jeans so these next couple things are
from Windsor this one I'm really happy
with it because it's very long he covers
your butt if you're wearing leggings but
it's so soft like it feels like a high
quality shirt hopefully it doesn't
shrink a lot when I wash it because that
tends to happen with me but I really
like it I think it's a good color this
is one of my favorite things I got
because it's so cool and I don't have
anything like this it's kind of like a
vest type thing again it's from Windsor
it has a high neck I'm really into high
next for fall and winter and then it
looks like this but it's open completely
on the sides and it has to belt things
on each side so you can
tighten it up to however you want so
yeah I just think this will be really
cute with a turtleneck like a white
turtleneck or something underneath it
and I just love this right here I think
it's so cool and add something different
to the top that's all I got from Windsor
and then I got this from Zara oh I got
this from Zara says right there and this
is another kind of mustard yellow top
it's more yellow than mustard you can
see the difference between the top I
have in this one but I like this one
it's kind of a little bit more cropped
as well so you can wear some
high-waisted jeans with it and then the
back is cute it kind of just has like a
little crease in it not all the actual
creases but these little flaps right
here I think is just really cute it has
something different to it so and then I
did get this from revolve clothing as
well it's a turtleneck type top but it's
all see-through throughout it and an
inset bodysuit as well so I would wear a
black bra with this or a bra let
probably a bra to be a little bit more
on the sexy side with it because this is
a very sexy shirt but yeah it just has
all of these see-through parts in it
and I really like it I like the body
suits right now I'm into them right now
I kind of go through phases with body
suits because sometimes I love them
sometimes I hate them right now I'm
loving them I'm moving on to baby I have
a few things I normally don't shop at
bebe but I've found a lot of cute stuff
so this is the first thing that I got is
just a crop top with kind of like these
little Victorian sides I think it's
really really pretty so that's what that
looks like and then I got this like
casual baseball team so I'm probably
gonna take of me this weekend it's super
super soft I didn't know I had this
little logo on the back but you can't
see it with my hair because I don't like
showing the logo baby I don't know it's
just not my thing
but I really like this baseball tee I
got mine in a medium and it fits really
well really slouchy and it's just very
bouncy and soft so I like that a lot
hopefully I remember to take that this
is another bodysuit that I got really
cute it has a see-through part here in
the front so shows a little bit of
cleavage I really like the neckline I
think that's super different and like I
said it is the bodysuit all the way
and then you have this exposed zipper in
the back Phoebe has really awesome like
sexy clothing I really really like it
another body suit from bebe is this red
one which i think is so pretty this will
be fun to wear more towards
Christmastime but I love this body suit
I think it's so flattering it like
doesn't show a lot of skin it's just
really sexy so has these little slits
right here oh wait so has these little
slits right here at the top again with a
high neck and it just goes down really
casual this is like my kind of style
something classy but still sexy you know
nothing too crazy and then I got this
other turtleneck with some fishnets I
actually have a shirt like this that I
bought from bebe last year and I have
worn it it's a white one and it has kind
of like fishnet and it has nude
throughout but it's off the shoulder and
it's really pretty
and I saw this one and it reminded me of
it and I just I loved it so it's just a
higher neck with this fishnet thing
going on right here and it's really
really tight I get medium larges in this
because I don't want it to be super
tight to my body so medium larges work
really well for me I know you can't see
it but I'll try it on for you guys then
the second to last thing I got from bebe
is this adorable like sweater Cape thing
I don't know it has a turtleneck again I
think another white turtleneck
underneath this would be really pretty
to layer and it's just really loose and
flowy great for like a casual day or a
casual date night and it goes all the
way down so you can wear this and a
white turtleneck black leather leggings
and some boots and you would be set it
would just look so cute and this is
really really soft and it's not too
heavy and it's not itchy either the last
thing I got from baby is the most
exciting thing because I've been dying
for one of these since last year I've
been obsessed with them and it's a cape
so it's like a tweed cape I love it I
think it's so chic so classic I could
not wait to wear this I cannot wait to
wear it I'm gonna wear it with some like
leather leggings and a black top I'm
just obsessed with it this
no justice it's just so cute and it
makes me like feel fancy and I don't
know I really like capes I bake cakes
look awesome on other people that's my
only cape that I have I believe I
believe that's the only cape I have but
every time I see other people in capes
I'm like oh I won't wand so I finally
got one this year cuz last year they
were a huge hit and I was like okay I'm
purchasing this I'm purchasing one this
year and that's what I did
um this is also from revolve clothing I
love this color it's like a rust color I
love this kind of chef-style
look in the front I call it chef style
because you know how like some chefs
have their things go over I don't know
what they call it but it also ties at
the bottom and I just love this color
with my hair and my skin tone I think it
is beautiful there's this Zara top which
this I need to wear like right now
because it's gonna get too cold to wear
it soon but it's one of those eyelet
tops and it's a light gray blue and it's
really really pretty and then this is
another one my favorite tops from Zara
it just it's so it's like art I don't
know it's really cool has another high
neck and then this distressed part right
here where it has some strings pulled at
the top but I love it I love the look of
this it zips up in the back it's just a
really simple top but I feel like it's
very well made really structured and I
feel like it just has a lot to say is
that weird I feel like it just speaks
you know and then the last two things
are from ASOS I got this top because I
was dying to get it they didn't have my
size the first time that I went to pick
it up and then they finally had it and I
was like oh my god it's meant to be
because I'm obsessed with this style so
incredibly much I cannot wait to wear
this with other leggings but it's just a
top it's a very very long like cardigan
type of top but a zips here in the front
like a shirt so it's a shirt until about
your belly button and then it goes down
like that it isn't floor-length or
anything but it goes all the way down
and I just think this is so sexy I think
it's so sexy with like leather leggings
and then some really gorgeous boots I'm
so excited to wear this and so I needed
to get enough
jacket because I'm going up to New York
in December ish and I don't have
anything if you if you live in New York

climate what are some really good
jackets to get for like to keep me like

December in New York cold as all get-out

gonna be in New York a couple other
times when it's really cold and I just
needed like a camel jacket like this and
this is from ASOS and I really like it
it's it's supposed to be a little bit
bigger and oversized but I love this
color
I love the front too and the pockets are
really cute and I love the inside I can
just see this with a white turtleneck
I mean why turtlenecks are my thing I
don't even have a white turtleneck I
need to buy something but I just really
like this it's really oversized and cute
and just something you can layer put a
lot of scarves under a sweater under and
