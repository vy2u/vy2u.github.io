be filming a a fall makeup tutorial and
I know what some you were thinking in
September take a moment calm down it's
not fall yet but there are also people
like me when September first comes
around everything spring is out the door
and we are bringing fall decor in my
downstairs is fully decorated with fall
decor I need to work on this background
right here to kind of get it up to date
but I personally love fall makeup I love
deep vampy looks I love rocking them I
love watching people wear deep looks
it's just one of my favorite times for
makeup and fashion so I just couldn't
wait and I wanted to do this video for
you I hope you guys enjoy it
and yeah this is gonna be more of a
dramatic look because you know for the
first one it's got to be real dramatic
so for the wearable fall let me know
down below what kind of look you want me
to do for that if you want like a pop of
color on the lower lash line if you want
more of a deeper nude for a lip let me
know your thoughts down below in the
comments and let's just go ahead and get
started okay guys so first off we're
gonna get started and prime our eyes
with this Smashbox lid primer in light
so I have two pallets out because I
don't know what palettes I want to use I
really like the shades in this Natasha
Danone a star palette like these deep
burgundy purple colors right here
they're really speaking to me then I
also have this approp the Sephora Pro
warm palette so I'm not sure which one
I'm gonna go with just yet um I might go
in with this one first just cuz I really
want to play with these colors right
here because this is the lip we're going
with I know I know I'm thinking I'm
gonna go into this section first color
going to take in this palette is this
little warm tone Brown right here and
just throw that into the crease it's a
really nice color it's like the perfect
transition shade for me I think I'm
gonna do more of a halo eye today and
ever really do makeup tutorials but I
don't know man when fall comes around
I'm just all about it I love a good fall
makeup look and I feel like a lot of
other people do too I'm said you like
dramatic makeup wear like if it's not
full glam I'm usually barefaced we're
just gonna blend this into the crease if
you're wondering what some of my
favorite brushes are I did do a full
video so I will link that down below and
up here as well in the screen if you're
on a computer so you can check it out
but yeah a lot of my favorite brushes
are in that video
then I'm gonna go in with this color
right here which is
a little bit more cool-toned I'm gonna
throw this right below right into the
crease just to kind of deepen it up a
little bit because it is a little bit
deeper than the first color we just put
on I know you guys hear me talking about
Natasha Genoa all the time but honestly
her eyeshadows are just I have so much
fun when I play with her eyeshadows
they're easy to work with and every time
I do a look I don't ever have to do it
over you know what I mean like it always
turns out the way I want it to watch I'm
gonna do jinx myself now
so next I'm gonna take this purple shade
right here and I'm gonna use this little
blending brush which was from a Amazon
rush kit and I'm just gonna throw this
in the outer V and again into the crease
as well as purple it is so pretty so
right in here I'm also taking it all the
way to the inner corner it's okay if
your crease shake kind of gets lost we
can go back in and blend everything out
then we're gonna take a nice clean
blending brush i'm using this sigma e25
and i'm going back in with the first
transition shade and I am just gonna
quickly touch up those edges real quick
and just blend it out and I'm doing this
with a more precise brush just so we can
really blend out those edges let me go
back in with that purple shade and the
one that we use and we're just gonna
touch this up again I never do purple
eyes I used to always love purple and it
kind of got away from it next I'm gonna
go in with this deep burgundy color
and I'm gonna go right on top of that
but a little bit lower so I'm gonna take
it into the crease I don't really want
to focus it right in here it's okay if
you get a little bit on the lid we're
gonna cover up that little halo spot in
a minute with a different shadow but I
really want to make sure this color is
right below that purple
and then what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually going to take a different brush
I'm going to use this Mac 239 it's a
little bit smaller a little bit more
tightly packed and this does hold
pigment a little bit better than the
Amazon brush so I'm gonna go back into
this shade and just build it up one more
time to really get that intense color
payoff and since this does have a pretty
stiff shape to it it goes exactly where
you want it to I actually got this brush
in the duty-free store we were traveling
I saw a Mac counter and I was like uh
yes I would like my brushes as if I need
more but I just got three and then just
deepen it up just a bit more because
we're not deep enough just yet I am
going to take the Natasha doughnut
blackest black matte eyeshadow this is a
really intense black matte eyeshadow and
I so nice I'm gonna take that same 239
brush I'm just gonna flick this here and
here it's really deep in this lookup
very pigmented black but the one thing
about this eyeshadow too is it blends so
well so I'm going to take that same
brush we've been blending out the edges
with with that burgundy color and we're
just gonna blend that black we're just
gonna go right on top and blend it out
because that black is gonna show through
even if you blend on top of it the inner
corner look at that I mean the way it
blends is just phenomenal take a little
bit into the crease hope it all together
and then one more time I am gonna take
the fluffy crease brush that we used in
the beginning again with our transition
Shea from the beginning and just go over
all the edges right here
though this is what we're working with
so far and now we're going to take
another one my favorite brushes this is
the Mac 242
this is another brush that I bought
duty-free because I wanted another one
and I'm going to use some glitter glue
by Too Faced this is one of my favorite
products to use for really intense
glitters or loose pigments so I'm going
to work one eye at a time and the shade
that we're gonna go in with is this one
right here that is the shade Rhea go
into the center of the eye again I'm
gonna work one eye at a time because
this glitter glue will dry fast and if
you don't blame quickly just kind of all
goes away
to Korea right in here take it all the
way the crease and just lightly feather
out the edges I love that reassure that
is so stinkin pretty
again up to the crease lightly feather
it out and then we're gonna go in with
that same little blending brush we used
earlier and just lightly blend any edges
crease I am gonna try a few new products
in this video we have some drugstore in
high-end but I wanted to try out this
Victoria Beckham Estee Lauder collab
it's a matte eyeliner so it's in the
shade 0-1 blackest and it just looks
like this I'm curious to see if it's a
felt-tip or not haha
it's a felt-tip my favorite so that's
what it looks like and we're just gonna
go in and try this bad boy out this has
a nice matte eyeliner I will say I like
pins better like pens I'll keep dipping
into the jar but this is not bad okay so
there is that just really pretty
oh we're dropped it and it's all over my
sweatpants but luckily these are like
makeup pants so really does matter but
there's still over myself pants
I feel like this felt tip though will
give in because the tip is already kind
of going down yeah this filter is not
gonna last long at all
I wonder if you guys can see you see how
it's kind of bending down at the front
that's after one use so I don't know how
I'm gonna feel about this long-term okay
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
apply lashes and then I'm gonna come
right back and we will finish off the
face makeup oh I'm actually gonna take
this off and I'm gonna go in with double
we're in a four in one this is probably
gonna match me a little bit better
anyways umm so yeah I'll be right back
okay so I just put on the Estee Lauder
Double Wear important one is still a bit
more as she at my neck but the color
guard okay so we're gonna move on to
concealers I think I'm just gonna go
with what I know this is the Tarte
shaped tape I love trying out new
products but sometimes I'm just like
should then what I know okay so now
we're gonna try out another new product
so japonesque Koo Midori loose finishing
powder and again this is a PR so it's
just a clear translucent powder I was
like nice packaging it has a little
sponge in the mirror on top and then
guessing you twist this no that is not
what you do it's just right there okay
so it's just a bigger package for the
sponge when I was in Fiji I actually
went back to using the Laura Mercier
powder I'm really liking it again the
translucent one it just looked so good
in photos I didn't want to wear like a
different powder and be the only person
in the photos with like white cast you
know I didn't want to like try it out
with a bunch of pictures I feel like
this one would leave a white cast to be
honest with you just cause it's so
finely milled but let's just see how it
looks
it's okay I don't feel like it looks
very smoothy so for the other side when
you use the Laura Mercier translucent
powder something has a little bit of a
tint to it oh my gosh way better look at
how much smoother that is compared to
this side this side just looks a little
cakey this side looks more smooth okay
so I'm personally gonna pass on this one
I feel like it's just emphasized texture
and didn't ever look that great on my
skin so I'm just gonna pass on that one
because I already have enough texture I
don't need to emphasize it even more
okay so for bronzer in contour I'm gonna
stick with what I know and that's the
Smashbox contour palette I really like
this one this one's the light/medium one
they also have a medium dark and I'm
gonna take this bronze shade and we're
just gonna go ahead and bronze up the
skin let me tell you guys I also in Fiji
contoured I did a liquid contour with
this it's the Smashbox Studios skin 15
hour where foundation in the shade 4.3
so before I put powder on it everything
I did a cream contour with that and it
looked so good in photos I didn't even
put on a contour afterwards like once I
set my face I just added some bronzer
and blush but I did actually contour and
it looked so good so I highly recommend
that to contour with cuz it looks so
nice so I'm just taking the warmer shade
in this palette and we're just gonna
bronze first add some color back to the
face so if you don't follow me on snap
Smashbox came out with some metallic
liquid lips that aren't gonna watch
chill January but I wanted to use one so
bad in this video but I was like I'm not
gonna use something that they can't get
till January they're so pretty you guys
I can't wait for you to be able to get
your hands on them because they are just
they are stunning my favorite I think
right now is XO vallata
it's like a nice metallic bronze I wore
it in a photo on Instagram so you should
go check it out they have a really
pretty very metallic shades purple they
have a really pretty teal they're so
nice then I'm gonna take the ashy
contour shade in here so they have
everything you need in this palette you
have something to set your
cela with and also bright in so if you
do what I did and just set your face
with a translucent powder you could
still go underneath your eyes with this
and highlight and it does add that nice
highlighted effect it's a really pretty
powder so it just looks like that's very
creamy and then you have this warm tone
shade you can bronze it and then this
actually tone to contour with so I
really like it I'm gonna try out this
new brush though that I got mac 135
again duty free and I'm gonna add a
little bit to this brush and we're just
gonna lightly contour lightly okay so we
are contoured and bronze gonna blend
everything together with my duo fiber
brush again this is one of the brushes
mentioned in my favorite brushes video
go also take that lighter powder as well
if you wanted to and kind of carve out
your contour and let that bake for a
second and dust it away and it just
gives you more of a sharp edge so
there's a little things you can do with
this powder if you wanted more of a
natural highlight you could just
highlight with this in here and it'll
look great so now we're gonna go in with
the Tarte Amazonian clay blush in
sensual so pretty just a nice nude color
I didn't want anything too crazy because
we have such dramatic eyes and lips
going on my cheeks it's kinda like a
bronzy nude color and then we're gonna
use a different highlight palette
can I talk then we're gonna use a
different highlight pallor then we're
gonna use a different highlight palette
this is from a flower beauty which is
Drew Barrymore's line it's really really
nice I like a lot of her stuff they used
to be in Walmart but they're not anymore
so I don't know what is wrong with
Walmart but she had really good items so
they need to bring her best out of all
the things I've tried I have not tried
this out from her brand but I have heard
really great things I'm gonna be using
this smashbox precise highlighting brush
i'm gonna go into this one right here
drop that brush
so pretty I love this highlight brush -
oh my god I just got like a bunch of
product on there oh my lord
definitely top off your brush I have to
go in and boom this out but holy crap
such a nice powder and it doesn't like
emphasize texture really alright I gotta
blend this out I know I know I gotta
blend it out shaytans duo fiber brush
won this thing out I have it really
intense if you wanted to you could also
blend it out and then put a little bit
right on the tops of your cheekbones to
make it pop like right in the center to
really get that glow going holy SH
that's nice you guys if you can find it
I believe they're online it's flower
beauty I really like this brand their BB
cream is also like a full coverage
foundation like it's amazing gorilla
glue cuz i guerrilla glue the stand I
[Laughter]
got it to work okay so I just contoured
my nose actually use the warmer shade
and the contour palette from Smashbox
and it looks really good I really like
this brush because it's angled so you
get right on the top of your cheekbone
first off so you have really precise
blending but then you could take the end
like the really pointy side like this
and really highlight that knows
precisely like right down the middle
okay so we've got our highlight on our
blush now we need move on to brows I'm
gonna using my benefit precisely my brow
as well as the goof proof brow pencil
and I'm gonna do this off camera cuz it
takes me forever to put these on so I'm
going to do my brows and then come back
and we will finish off at the rest of
this look okay so the brows are done
this one's being the wolf feisty but
it's okay we're just gonna let it go I'm
gonna go ahead and highlight actually
with what's in this highlight palette
I'm gonna take the same shade that they
used on the top of my cheeks on my brow
bone as my brow bone highlight and also
in our corner highlight you know what I
really loved during the fall time and
all that smokey-eye hole is everything
to me I have certainly loved it
next up we're gonna use this Victoria
Beckham Estee Lauder eyeliner this is
the eye liner in zero one black and this
is cool because it also comes with a
sharpener and it has vb on here so
that's cool and then you also get the
eyeliner there's two ends oh there's a
vanilla end and a black end so that's
cool so you can line the inner rim to
really brighten up the eyes or you can
deepen it with the black and you already
know what we're gonna do give me the
black whoa that is so that's like a gel
that's one swatch one swipe holy cow
guys that is so black and creamy
absolutely no tugging at all only thing
I would worry about with this is it
running because I do have watery eyes as
well so I'm just a mess okay I'm a li my
eyes get water and love that okay moving
back into the Natasha Genoa
star palette I'm actually gonna go in
with the burgundy shade and I'm gonna
use this Sigma flat brush or at their
press this up against that lower lash
line kind of drag it down a little bit
to really smoke it out I'm gonna love
this look this is so smoky this is
everything out wine and life then we're
gonna use a pencil brush and we're gonna
go in with the purple shade and we're
gonna blend out the edges of that
Burgundy going with a really light hand
when you go in with that purple because
it is still deeper but I didn't want to
do like my transition shade on the
bottom because I still wanted to really
smoke it out and make that purple pop so
going in with a light hand still blends
it out but gives us that purple in the
lower lash line okay now I'm gonna take
my favorite bottom lash mascara this is
the wet and wild a skinny mascara it's
amazing for the bottom lashes it really
just separates each lash and doesn't
give them clumpy at all I think it's
really important when you have such a
heavy look to put mascara on your lower
lashes just to really complete
everything now the fun part we're moving
on to lips and for the lip product today
I love the Mac liquid lip formula this
is the retro matte liquid lip color this
is so good I've used so many of their
nude shades I just love them this is
like my first time really using a deep
tone so I'm excited to see how it works
hopefully it's still super pigmented I'm
gonna go in with a classic this is the
Vino what lip liner from Mac this used
to be the thing like with Mac's rebel
lipstick oh my gosh okay so this is the
shade uniformly fabulous girl
okay guys so this is the completed look
I really like the way that it turned out
is very dramatic everything I love in a
makeup look and yeah I had so much fun
at filming this I hope you guys enjoyed
it as well keep in mind if you don't
want to do a super dark lip you can
always do a nude and it would still look
really great with these eyes thank you
