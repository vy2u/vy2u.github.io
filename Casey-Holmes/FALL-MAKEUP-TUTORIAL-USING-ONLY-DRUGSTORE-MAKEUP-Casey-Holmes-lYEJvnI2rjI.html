be doing my fall drugstore makeup
tutorial I just did a makeup tutorial I
think it was last sticker the week
before that had more high-end products
in it this time or doing all drugstore
so I hope you were excited because I
have quite a few things to play with
today but I don't have any announcements
or anything like that to share with you
guys so we can just go ahead and get
started with this video don't forget to
subscribe before you leave and let me
know down below what you want to see
next in the comments let's just go ahead
and get started it's the first thing
we're gonna do is prime our eyes I'm
gonna use this Maybelline master prime
right here we're just gonna go ahead and
apply this onto our lids so we have some
sort of base to go off of now I'm going
to go and I'm going to use the Melissa
Michelle Ulta palette this is a really
pretty palette available at Ulta this is
a drugstore palette and there's a few
things in here you have a lippy a
highlighter a blush and then you have
all of these shadows over here so we're
gonna use this one right here first and
we're gonna apply this all over the lid
so what have you guys been up to I feel
like it's been a minute since I filmed
and really it hasn't been that long I've
just been super stressed I've had so
much going on on my end I have so many
secrets and today I kind of got some
not-so-great news about one of my new
projects I'm working on so it's just
pushing us back even more but I'm hoping
to get it resolved soon I have a phone
call tomorrow to try to figure out what
the heck to do next I have one project
I'm working on that you guys kind of
know about I mean if you follow me on
snapchat and Instagram you see like
little sneak peeks and everything though
you kind of have an idea what's going on
now I'm gonna take this shade right here
and then throw this into the crease so
yeah a lot of you kind of know what's
going on but I'm just I'm kind of like
all over the place right now and I'm
filming as much as I can we just went
out and shot a lot of stuff yesterday
which I showed you guys like on
Instagram and it is well a snapchat but
I also have another project going on Oh
Steve you've been guessing like my
projects that I'm doing I just haven't
completely confirmed them yet one of the
projects is not a collab the other one
is so also a lot of you asked in my last
video what my nail color is and I
no honestly cuz I just went into the
salon
looked at their nail samples and found
this color and I was like that's exactly
what I want I knew I just wanted like a
olive green color yeah a lot are you
asking what it is and I'm not too sure
of the name I didn't look at it to be
honest with you just looking for like a
true olive green that's what I did I
didn't want a green with blue in it I
didn't want a green with like lime or
whatever I just wanted that true olive
color so found it that's what I got and
I'm gonna go in with Bing Bing which is
this really pretty warm orange --red
kind of color and I'm just gonna put
this oh that is pigmented put this in
the outer V and in the crease is the
first time I've had a chance to play
with this palette and it's so pretty and
then I'm thinking about possibly doing a
lighter fall makeup look like something
not so dramatic I just posted a photo on
Instagram it's just like a really bear
eye with a bold lip which I feel like
I'm sorry I have like a dog hair here
which I feel like I do that every year
but it always gets requested I think
people just like seeing updated products
and stuff so let me know if you guys
want to see that really simple fall
makeup look cuz I'll do it for ya it's
just if you want it or not I'm gonna go
back in with rosemary which was the
second shade we used like for our
transition I'm just gonna lightly buff
this and blend out that line from
bingbing
anyways with these new projects that I'm
working on you guys one of them very
soon one of them is like ready to go
almost like if everything behind the
scenes was done we could probably go
live in a week but like I said I just
got some news today that kind of pushes
it back but once I get that figured out
we will be able to go live pretty soon
I'm hoping before my birthday way before
my birthday is what I'm hoping for which
is November 25th so I'm hoping way
before then stay tuned like within I'm I
was shooting for her early this month
but I don't know what to see I have not
had any time to go to the gym or
anything and I think that's really
throwing me off because one way that I
really keep my mind clear is going to
the gym like I need to go to keep my
sanity and last night Davis and I went
for a run around post I think it was
like almost three miles which was good I
felt great this morning I'm really sore
but it felt really great I'm not a
runner so doing almost three miles was
like satisfaction for me I felt really
good but I think that really made me
want to get back into working out again
because it just helps clear my mind it
helps get me back on focus like releases
all that stress that I have I miss it so
much
I just have not had freakin time take
the shade Harley right here I'm just
doing this one in the RV this one's
really pigmented too I will just dip my
brush in there apply that color it's
really pretty palette then I'm gonna go
back in with Bing Bing which is that red
Brown that we used a really warm like
orange e tone I'm just gonna go back in
the crease to really kind of buff this
out and make sure it's really sure it
really stands out so here are the three
shades I'm thinking of working with I'm
thinking I'm gonna go in with this one
maybe this one all over the lid this one
in the inner corner I think that's what
we'll do we'll just do a nice easy look
today so if you are kind of new with
makeup this is a way to get into more
dramatic fall makeup looks because this
is a pretty easy one to create I'm gonna
take this shade right here which is that
really pigmented gold I'm gonna put this
all over the lid all the way to
with that deep brown I'm leaving a
little bit of that inner corner open for
the lightest shade now I did not wet
this product with anything and I didn't
put any glitter glue down and it's still
really pigmented I'm sure if you went in
and wet your brush with mac fix+ or even
had a glitter glue down you're gonna get
some high high shine then I go back in
with Harley at that deep brown color and
I'm just gonna fluff this right out here
just to blend them all together let me
get like nice and seamless and then we
will take that same shade and go in with
Lola
oh I lie like a pumpkin I love it I also
have these like where these caught the
jcat eye Stoppers just these little guys
I didn't see like a color I can
incorporate and they also have these
prism chrome metal mooses they look like
this got these in PR the other day look
at this one real quick it's in the shade
holograph e-types polygraph you types is
like I think that's more iridescent it's
not a holographic let me see this other
one real quick I want to see what this
shade looks like this one's in the shade
chrome galaxy that looks so pretty
let's see someone to maybe pop it right
on top of that gold I've never used like
I'm loose before but that's super pretty
let's just wing it let's just see what
it looks like oh my girl oh that is a
wet look it kind of takes the gold away
but for this look I'm definitely
thinking the gold the best way to go so
I'm hoping it didn't just ruin this look
alright so I'm quickly going to fix this
I make it look like this one again
because I just messed it up now I'm
gonna put some wing liner on and I'm
gonna use my wing woman by Lottie London
I love this liner this is a brand new
one so I'm super excited and then I will
also pop on these I lower luxe gilded
lashes and then I will be right back and
we will finish off with face look at
that I love with the flowers in the back
like Hello fall we're here so I put on
my lashes in liner much happier now that
I fixed this eye I couldn't let it stay
like that so now we're gonna move on to
my face and the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to prime it with this so
big glory one heck of a blot primer I
love this primer I will be doing a video
dedicated to telling my holy grail
makeup products I actually mentioned
this on Twitter and I figured I
mentioned it to you guys I'm gonna do
one for drugstore products and also
high-end plan on doing it very soon stay
tuned for that I feel like I got a lot
of makeup tutorials coming out for you
guys
so I hope you're excited lots of stuff
going out on that
you know what else who would want to see
I need to do like all Matt all makeup
look but then like I don't know I need I
need some more inspiration need to go
look on Pinterest anyways now what we're
gonna do is move on to foundation so I'm
gonna use the covergirl healthy elixir
foundation I love this one gonna use
this Jade 7:45 and warm beige pretty
sure this is gonna match my self tan
right now and I'm also going to apply
that with my L'Oreal sponge this is
actually a brand new one so I'm really
excited about it I feel like my mood
just completely switched like off-camera
because I've had time to like stop and
relax for a second okay this feels
different why does this feel different
because this is the Maybelline one not
the L'Oreal one oh stop what no no no no
what is it who is this who are you oh no
this is L'Oreal but I feel like they
changed it has a weird feeling to it huh
to see if this is still good why change
something that doesn't need to be
changed this has definitely changed
we're gonna go ahead move on have like
daisy hair all over my face right now
like I said this is in the shade 745
warm of beige and we're just gonna pop
this on the back of my hand oh yeah this
should match me it's pretty dark I love
this foundation even if you have oily
skin but you're looking for something
that's gonna give you a really pretty
glow like if you love the look of glowy
skin but you're like uh-uh I have oily
skin I don't want to go for like a
foundation that is meant for dry skin
because most this is a little dark but
we'll put concealer on most foundations
that are meant to be Chloe aren't that
great for oily skin because they're
geared more towards dry skin but this is
one of those products that honestly
feels okay this is different and I don't
like it I don't like this at all
L'Oreal what did you do yeah I really
like this product does oxidize a little
bit I've noticed like I feel like the
darker you go it oxidizes but it's not
too bad once you put like concealer &amp;amp;
stuff on I do normally like to apply it
with a sponge but that sponge just did
not work for me today yeah that's a
really really feel like L'Oreal changed
up that sponge
really making me sad so you can build it
up if you don't need a lot of coverage
you don't have to use as much I love a
full coverage finish though cover up
that rosacea I really have a feeling
that this winter my skin's gonna go
crazy because it's gonna be so cold and
like my skin reacts to like super hot
weather as well as really cold weather
so I'm gonna be into my toe a lot of
people are asking me if I would consider
laser and yes I would I'm just a I'm not
in Atlanta again I don't really trust
any doctors out here that don't really
know my skin that well I know that
sounds bad but I just I have my favorite
people in Atlanta that I like to mess on
my skin and I've also heard that it kind
of hurts so I'm just I'm just not there
yet you know it's not a priority for me
it's also not cheap we will see
eventually what I will do but right now
it is not I'm not getting it right now
okay now we're gonna take the Maybelline
fit me and the Maybelline a better skin
concealer I love these concealers this
one is in the shade zut ten light just a
little light for me right now so we're
gonna mix it with this other Maybelline
one but these are both really great
concealers the Maybelline fit me is one
that I use all the time with Tarte shape
tape is it so lightweight it's
definitely not full coverage but it
really does brighten the skin really
nicely and it looks really pretty on the
skin like it doesn't look heavy or
anything like that and then the color of
this one is medium zero for just I had a
little bit of you know tan back into the
skin
I find that Maybelline has like the best
concealers I always tend to like love
their concealers and like any of their
face products like I love the dream
matte mousse that's really great
what's that other one the better skin
fill a great face product so if you're
late in the market for some new face
products and you're oily I would highly
suggest the Maybelline Maybelline has
really been one of my favorite brands
for face products I like to press when
I'm doing like under-eye concealer with
a brush
I don't really apply under-eye concealer
with a brush that often but when I do I
always press it
and because otherwise I'm just gonna
swipe it all over the place now we're
gonna set it I'm gonna be using this la
girl setting powder in a banana yellow
this is just like a setting powder I
love this powder so much I'm not gonna
bake I'm just gonna set like look I'm
almost out just probably last time I'll
be able to use it to be honest with you
I like the tint of this too it's not too
light so in photos this looks really
great as well I need to order another
one of these because I love it so much
it mattifies smooth it doesn't
accentuate texture anything like that
just gives you a nice smooth base I
remember on to bronzer I'm going to be
using this volta sorry I'm going to use
this Ulta contour kit and I'm gonna go
in with this shade which is in warmth
bronze warmth bronze and I'm just gonna
bronze my skin with it and I'm gonna use
this soho brush right here this is a
drugstore brush actually gonna mix it
with bombshell bronzer i used to use
this palette all the freaking time you
know when you just you use stuff a lot
but then like you get distracted with
new products i feel like this year has
had like so many new launches it's so
hard to keep up and it's so hard to
remember your must-haves in your go to
like you have to stop first i can go
back in your drawers and like get it
together and reach for the product that
you know you used to love so I've kind
of been wanting to do that lately just
like take a moment it take a step back
you know we don't need every single new
item that's out on the market I mean I'm
blessed enough to get PR products but
otherwise I would not have all this
makeup this palette is not orange it
just adds a lot of warmth to the skin
and it really shapes the face nicely so
I highly recommend checking it out Ulta
does have some really great products in
their makeup section so I recommend
checking it out and this is great for
like a makeup artist if you're wanting
something more affordable this is really
nice I'm gonna go in with golden bronzer
and I'm just gonna lightly contour with
this underneath my cheekbones what is
dark I recommend going in with a very
light hand I forgot how dark that was
so they also have highlighters in here
but I'm not going to use those today I'm
going to use something different but
first I'm going to add a touch of blush
I'm going to use this flower beauty
flowerpots blush in peach Primrose just
something a little bit lighter nothing
with too much color since we are gonna
have pretty dramatic eyes and these
flower Beauty blushes are amazing
they're super pigmented to highlight I'm
going to use this flower beauty again
the shimmer and strobe highlight palette
and I'm gonna use two different shades
I'm just gonna mix this golden one and
then this one at the very end just to
create my own highlight shade and we're
adding a little bit of gold in there
just to kind of go with the eyes and you
really just need to lightly dip your
brush in this thing because it is so
pigmented okay now let's move on to
brows I'm gonna try this out I haven't
tried it yet this is the Loreal brow
stylist shape and fill just looks like
this it reminds me of the benefit goof
proof brow pencil like has that same
kind of shape so we're gonna try this
out today and see how well it works I'm
using the shade blonde you know I
figured that was the color but I wanted
to triple-check and just make sure oh
yeah this is definitely super similar to
the goof proof brow normally what I do
with my benefit brow products is I go in
with goof proof like this and I just
fill in majority of the brow and then I
go in with precisely my brow and do the
inner part it's not a super precise
applicator it's more of like a fill in
your brow and go type of thing so let's
just see very lightly touching my brow
looking in here I think L'Oreal has a
smaller brow pencil too so you could go
in and really touch that up that's not
bad I really like the shade I mean once
my goof proof runs out I'd definitely be
using this one so let me see if I can
use this I'll or brow pencil and blonde
see if I can maybe get this in here
and I laura is a drugstore brand as well
so there are the brows done love those
two products I think they're amazing I'm
gonna set them with this essence make me
brows it's kind of like the two-faced
brow filler that I use just more
affordable just kind of lightens them up
add some highlights to the brows just
makes them look a little bit more
natural and also hold them in place so
I'm gonna go in with this a.m. to p.m.
liner from Lottie London it's in the
shade velvet it's like a really pretty
purple color very pigmented matches the
Alena shade in the palette
oh girl that is pretty figured out I
change it up a little bit put some
purple on the lower lash line and I'm
gonna take Elena which is the purple and
the palette push that up against that
lower lash line okay so it's not too
purple on your eye and then I'm gonna go
in with rosemary again which was the
first like transition shade that we used
and put this under here just to blend
out those edges and we're also
connecting it like back here to the
wings liner I like love this look it's
so dramatic
it's the drugstore okay so I'm also
going to put mascara on my lower lashes
I'm gonna use the skinny mascara from
wet and wild miss Glenda this is the
best the best the best free lower lashes
in my opinion so now what are we gonna
do is I'm actually gonna highlight
underneath my brow with the kind of gold
color right here in the flower Beauty
palette about said powder and I'm also
going to add a little bit of that inner
corner this L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
liquid lipstick this one's in the shade
cowboy
this is the color I was going for okay
guys so this is the completed makeup
look I actually really like it it's
super fall got a lot of warm tones in
there a little pop of purple on the
lower lash line and I like this lip
color it's actually drying down matte so
I find that really interesting it's like
a nice comfortable matte formula so I
hope you guys enjoyed this fall makeup
look thank you if so much for watching I
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you did enjoy it and I will see you guys
in my next video triple a credits
alright hang up the phone and let your
heart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
