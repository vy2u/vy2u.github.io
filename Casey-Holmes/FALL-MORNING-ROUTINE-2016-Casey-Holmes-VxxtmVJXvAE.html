wouldn't let you go if we stand in
mouths apart
hey guys welcome back to my channel
today I'm doing a fall morning routine
and I decided to do this on a day that I
was getting ready to go take some
Instagram photos because I'm trying to
do like cuter Instagram posts not just
like selfies and I have one of my
friends doing it for me and I'm so
excited we just had our first shoot
yesterday and it was so much fun I love
the way the photos turned out so if you
want to see those photos I will have my
Instagram here there's only one on my
Instagram now I might post one more but
I plan on doing a post like that more
often because it was just fun to kind of
get out of this room and not take
selfies and just post like a fashion
post so I had so much fun doing it and I
figured I would just show you guys like
my basic kind of morning routine and for
this video and working with Clinique to
show you guys some new products that I'm
really excited about I especially love
the new matte lipsticks that they have I
wore mine all day yesterday and I don't
have to touch up at all during the shoot
like it lasted all freaking day
I wait to share them with you guys and
show you a couple of my favorite colors
I did mix too to kind of get that
perfect nude pink color the way that I
edited this video is like in the first
part of the morning routine you're gonna
see me like it up hanging out my dogs
you know just like chill I'm not gonna
talk over it because it's kind of
self-explanatory but once we get to
skincare I'm going to show you my
favorite products right now for the
morning time and for the makeup tutorial
I didn't do a full one like sit down
show you every product but I will tell
you guys like what I used in things like
that so I hope you guys enjoy this video
if you do like it don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe so if you
want to see my fall morning routine then
let's just go ahead and get started
okay so first step for me is to wash my
face so I'm going to go ahead and use my
purity cleanser I've been using this for
a while I just think it's really nice
and it's gentle on the skin then after I
dry my face off from that I'm going to
move on to eye cream I've been using
this by by under eye eye cream and I
really like it because it sets into the
skin really quickly and a mixture under
eye area very smooth and moisturized
next I'm going in with the clinic acne
solutions all over clearing treatment
and this is great because it helps treat
any acne that you might already have and
also prevent any future breakouts it can
be used in the morning or at night
because it does provide some hydration
to help minimize deines and peeling that
you might get from breakouts so I've
been loving this lately especially since
my skin has been breaking out too due to
the weather change then I'm using my
lemare moisturizer this is just a gel
cream moisturizer so it really sinks
into the skin nicely and I really like
it a lot one of my favorites and I also
take it down my neck and I just feel so
refreshed after the skincare routine I
really like it so we're going to go
ahead and go into the makeup room and
like I told you guys earlier in the
beginning of the video I was getting
ready for a little Instagram photo shoot
thing so honestly I was not playing on
doing
look but it ended up dramatic so I don't
know what happened there but I did use
the Urban Decay Naked basics palette for
my eyes and then for my face I am using
my Smashbox Studios skin foundation
because it does not change color like
with different lighting so I knew I
could rely on that for this shoot I had
then I just bronze my skin cleaned up my
contour contoured my nose I did the
whole shebang look at that highlight
though I mean seriously
and then I'm going to line my lips and
go in with this Clinique matte lipstick
these are new and I love them they
actually have a primer in them to make
them a little bit more long wearing and
smooth on the lips and I took this with
me to the shoot because it's compact and
easy to carry but honestly you guys I
didn't have to touch up at all
I'm not kidding when I say I did not
touch up during the whole shoot I was
really surprised so for a matte lipstick
that's really good and then I just went
in with a curling iron and weighed my
hair nice and wavy and then that is it
y'all I hope you enjoyed it if you want
to see a couple pictures then here you
go I hope you enjoy them you want to see
more go to my Instagram and I will see
y'all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
