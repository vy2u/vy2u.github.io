with you my morning routine for fall I
really hope you guys enjoy it and thank
you to my best friend terena for filming
this for me and yeah let's just go ahead
and get started
so of course the first thing I'm doing
is checking my Instagram I will leave my
link down below if you guys want to
follow me I just check all my social
media sites in the morning I think
almost all of us do that right and then
of course I have to take my puppies out
because they've got to go potty too so
that's what I'm gonna go ahead and do
just put their harnesses on and take
them outside coming back in of course
I'm going to put on some Spotify I love
music you guys know this and I just have
to put music on all the time then I'm
going to be making breakfast my go to a
breakfast item is an omelet I just take
two eggs a handful of spinach and a
little bit of a sharp cheddar cheese and
put that on my omelet I'm pretty simple
I don't add too much to it and I did
make two today because my best friend
was filming me so I couldn't not make
her one my mornings just consist of
making breakfast and playing with my
puppies and just kind of enjoying my
time with them and of course I start
making omelets and I have to say they're
pretty amazing I usually do a little bit
more spinach than this but I had to
share
ah then I'm moving on to my smoothie
this is the same smoothie I showed in my
spring morning routine I just can't stop
drinking it I love smoothies in the
morning like I have to have a bigger
breakfast so a smoothie and an omelet
will fill me up and keep me going for
quite some time
this is how it really gets done
something bad before so I just like to
go into my living room and catch up on
some YouTube and just some work and I
just thought I kind of chill out for a
little bit and eat my breakfast and then
after that is time to take a shower
now this day my hair was already curled
it was actually on third day hair so I
decided not to wash it so I'm just gonna
go ahead and brush my teeth and get my
shower ready and just do a quick little
body bath
so here are some of the products I use
today I use these stress relief from a
bath and Bodyworks love this stuff my
skintimate shaving cream and of course
my body wash from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
called mad about you it is absolutely
delicious and smells amazing after that
I'm going to moisturize with my jo
Malone peony body butter this stuff
smells amazing and I love it for daytime
because it's not overly moisturizing it
sinks into the skin super quickly and I
love it
moving on to outfit I just go in my
closet and I pick out anything the shirt
I picked out in the closet was actually
not the one I wore I decided to change
it up this boy then I'm moving on into
my makeup room and I'm going to go ahead
and touch up my hair so I'm taking my
batiste dry shampoo and just spraying my
hair to get rid of the oil since I am
running on third day hair so to curl my
hair recently I've been using this set
from nume it's a 16-1 curling iron set
and the main reason why I love this is
because I get so many curling irons sent
to my house but I love this one the most
because it comes in a little package set
so I can keep everything together and I
don't have the barrels all over the
place and losing them and I've been
curling my hair with this a lot recently
and it's actually what I used to curl my
hair a few days ago and you can still
see how curly my hair is so I've just
been loving it I've been using new me
for years now and I just I just love
their product so if you guys are
interested I do have a discount code for
the less trim set and some other holiday
sets that they have so I'll leave all of
those links and details down below if
you guys are interested so this is all I
do with my hair I just wrap it around
the barrel I don't have to hold it on
there for long since it already is
curled and then I'm just gonna go ahead
and shake it out and it gives me these
nice loose curls Pete said before a text
message was the only way to reach him
now he's saying that my place and loves
away
great I'm singing out Aretha all over
the track like a pizza I never wonder
something is it I don't want to either
being in money the same way falsities to
paint the same day those shows never go
what it's about but maybe we'll go
together and just pick it out already
put on a film until we sit on the couch
or we should get on a plane that will be
listening on I've written it down the
way the things laid out when you was
kissing her after that it's time to move
on to make up I just keep it basic
pretty much for the morning routine I
actually did a little bit more today
because I wanted to do a little bit
different but most days I just use a BB
cream concealer and mascara but I wanted
to add some more so I just added some
bronzer blush contour wings liner and a
darker nude lip if you want to know
details about my makeup I will leave
them in the description box below for
you
oh my hotel god I don't even know if he
knows what for he was crying on my
shoulder
I already told it trust and respect is
what we do it is full I never intended
to be next but you didn't need to send a
text that's all and I never saw as a
threat it's a bit and became my ex of
course it's not like go don't and then
after I was doing makeup I just put on
my hat and got dressed and I was ready
to go out the door and then I just put
on my Gucci Guilty which has been my
guilty pleasure
ahaha see what I did there but this is
my fall outfit I love it it's just super
fun if you want to know details I will
leave them in the description box below
