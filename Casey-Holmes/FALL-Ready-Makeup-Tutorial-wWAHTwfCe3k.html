a tutorial on this look I don't know
what I'm calling it I just kind of sat
down and weaned it I knew I wanted a
matte lip and something a little bit
darker for the eyes so that is what I
did for you today I did bust out my it's
Judy time palette again because you guys
know I love this I did another tutorial
with this palette which I will leave it
down below in the description box
completely different from this one and I
also use this one from BH Cosmetics it's
called wild and free and and these baked
eyeshadows are so pigmented and amazing
and I just love them so I wanted to play
with this one so if you didn't want to
do everything neutral like I did with
this look I know some people don't like
the fact that I do a lot of neutral
looks but I like neutral I feel like
neutral is the most wearable out of any
of the looks that people do but if you
wanted to add a pop of color I think
this color on the bottom lash line would
be stunning I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'm not gonna have any bloopers
because I was listening to very mellow
music and I was just like hmm it's
Sharon I've been listening him a ton
lately and don't forget if you guys
aren't following me on snapchat
I will leave my snapchat name snap snap
backs in touch you know if you guys
aren't following me on snapchat
I will leave my name down below so don't
forget to like the video if you liked it
and subscribe to my channel so you never
miss out on any of my videos and I will
see you in a couple of days bye
okay first pallet we're gonna take is
the is Judah time pallet we're gonna
take this shade right here and put this
all into our crease this will be our
transition shade it's really nice and
it's matte and affordable so you can't
go wrong so you want to make sure you
just blend this all over the crease
doesn't have to be perfect just make
sure you blend it really nicely this is
optional I'm applying tape to the outer
corners of my eyes just to create a nice
a sharp line you don't have to do this
if you don't want to but I like to do it
going with this color in the wild and
free palette I think that's what's
called I'm going to go ahead and apply
this all over the lid you can see just
how pigmented this is like it is so
beautiful it's a gorgeous kind of taupe
color and oh I love it I knew once I saw
it it was going all over my lid
and then the next shaver to go in with
is this one right here it's just a
copper shade and I just decided to use
this to kind of warm up the look so I'm
gonna do is just buff this right over
that taupe shade and I don't want it to
be like overpowering the taupe I just
want to add a little bit of warmth in
with it so just apply a little bit over
and apply most of it into the outer
corner and you'll be good to go I
dragged it in probably about half way
and then I was done with it then taking
this shade from the Institute II time
palette this is again another matte I'm
going to be applying this into the
crease and this will just blend out both
of those shades we just applied then
we're going in with this deep matte
shade oh my gosh this is so beautiful
this makes the look so what you're gonna
do is just apply this directly into the
crease with a pencil brush a pencil
brush will make it more precise and I'll
give it a more dramatic look you're also
going to fill in the outer V of the eye
as well and this will also really help
smoke it out you're gonna take this all
the way from the outer corner to the
inner corner in the tear duct area
you're gonna see where I place it in the
tear duct area I'm not gonna go right
there at the tear duct I'm just going
right above it kind of just outlining
that socket so it just gives a really
dramatic effect and I feel like it
really helps to shape the eye and I just
love it so you're just gonna go ahead
and do that on the other eye
and you'll be good to go
and keep in mind you can keep it as dark
or as light as you want I like mine a
nice and dark so that's what I did and
then I'm gonna go in with a gel liner in
black and just line my eyes I was out of
focus pretty much the whole time nothing
special just line the upper lash line
and then I lined my tight line with this
NARS eyeliner in Via Veneto and then
applied these lashes from House of
lashes going in with primer and my
foundation I'm using the Estee Lauder
Double Wear now for this foundation I'm
using this brush from BH Cosmetics that
is amazing I forget what set it's from
I'll leave it down below but the whole
set is absolutely amazing but this brush
is an exact dupe for the Sigma f80 it
blends just as amazing I'm telling you
if you don't want to spend the money on
Sigma brushes you need to check out
these BH ones because they're amazing
and totally worth the money see I like
it then I'm going out with concealer and
just doing my regular concealer routine
under the eyes and the center of the
face
then I'm gonna set my concealer with
this Laura Mercier translucent powder I
love this powder it's really nice and
fine and it never looks cakey so I just
figured I would go ahead and set the
concealer with that and then for bronzer
I'm gonna take this Laura Mercier
bronzer and number two beautiful
natural-looking bronzer I love it again
really nice and smooth never looks muddy
whatsoever just a natural looking color
and I love it and then for blush I'm
taking this Bobbi Brown blush and tawny
and I forgot how much I love this blush
but would you just look at it
I mean seriously it is so pretty oh gosh
I love Bobby Brown blushes and this just
made me fall in love with them all over
again so after you blend out your blush
I'm gonna go ahead and highlight with
this Bobby Brown highlight I think it's
in 24-karat I'll leave all the
information in the description box but
oh my gosh this is such a gorgeous color
I think I got this out of CCO I'm not
too sure but look at the highlight
really bam bam bam gorgeous then I
forgot to contour I realized so I just
took a little bit of the benefit hoola
bronzer and lightly contour my face
nothing crazy
after that I'm gonna fill in my brows
with this deep dark brunette fluid line
from Mac and then to highlight the brow
bone I'm gonna take the cream shade from
the its Tootsie time palette and just
apply that underneath the brow since we
do have so much shimmer going on and
then I'm going to line my waterline with
that NARS eyeliner once again and this
is again going to deepen up this look
going in with that same dark shade we
used earlier I'm going to press this
right there against the lower lash line
and the waterline and this will help
make sure that no skin peeks through and
it all looks nice and smooth and put
together so cuz like I feel like when
there's patches of skin showing it makes
it look a little bit sloppy so this will
really help with that and then going
back with the Schabel to use on our lid
I'm going to use this to smoke out that
color we just applied and it doesn't
give it an intense dramatic look but it
does smoke it out and make it look nice
and you know dramatic just nothing too
intense then you want to go ahead and
apply your favorite bottom lash mascara
mine is the Clinique bottom lash mascara
because I can't get enough of this stuff
and then for lip liner I'm gonna take
this one my Lancome it's called new tan
and I'm such an idiot because I had this
mirror in my face the whole time but
this is such a creamy smooth lip liner
you need it in your life you do I'm not
kidding and then I'm taking this matte
lip color from lorac and it's in pink
taupe applying that over that's my go-to
lip color right now it is stunning I
love it after that you are done I really
hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so

my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
