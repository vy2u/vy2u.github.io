is my favorite and I also have some
misses as well and I also have a lot of
things that aren't just makeup sell if
you're interested in that then
definitely stay tuned don't mind my hair
by the way I didn't really like doing it
so I just kind of tossed it up and was
hoping it looked kind of cute little
it's a little messy want to quickly say
before I get into this video get into
all the products at the beginning of
this year has just been amazing for me
so for this month I went to New York
Fashion Week for a little over a week
which is so awesome Davis graduated
Ranger School and my palette launched so
I mean hello that is like so much going
on it would such God it was such a good
month and I just want to thank you guys
for your support your support on my
pallet your support while Davis was away
now
 is going to start rolling I'm the
organ we moving soon and like doing all
types of stuff it's just going to be
insane I really want to thank you guys
so much for all the support on my - a
spotlight palettes that ik collabs with
Smashbox to make it has just been
incredible seeing all your photos and
just hearing how much you love them I
appreciate it so much they are my pride
and joy I'm actually wearing the Pearl
and the gold mix on my face right now so
if you're wondering what highlight I'm
wearing that is what is popping on my
face I really so great before we get
started don't forget to hit that
subscribe button so you don't miss out
on any of my videos and if you want to
know my favorites then let's just go
ahead and get started so let's start
with a body product this is being the
tops of the Nona's lo what body glow in
medium and oh my gosh this is so
gorgeous you guys this gives you like
that sweaty glow without actually
sweating you know what I mean for spring
and summer this is going to be amazing
like I said I got the shade medium it
has a little cap here on the front then
you just take it off put some on your
body or put a lot if you're like me
because I can't get enough of it and I'm
going to show you really quickly what it
looks like oh my gosh it is just
stunning I put this all over my chest my
shoulders you can put it on your legs if
you're wearing shorts or a dress
was too highlighted it just looks like a
really gorgeous glow and it looks very
healthy and youthful and let's talk
about skincare real quick okay so I have
noticed the biggest difference with my
skin lately and I will be the first to
say that it's definitely because I've
been taking off all of my makeup every
single night I used to not be very good
about it like sometimes I'd be like oh
I'm so tired I don't want to take it off
but for the past few months I've really
just been trying to take care of my skin
make sure I take all my makeup off no
matter what the issue is I've noticed a
big difference with the drunk elephant
products that I've been using so I'm
going to share with you some skin care
products that I think are unless have
these two are by drunk elephant
these are serums I have a daytime serum
and a nighttime serum I love the
packaging of these this is a day serum I
like to use I'll put this on before
anything else in fcc for my day serum
all you need is one pump of this I know
my skincare routine I did like two of
this nighttime serum but you only need
one pump I've completely switched one
pump and I think that my skin likes it a
lot better because it's not too
saturated with the product and this is
the TLC Framm booze glycolic night serum
does it refines and retexturize it and I
asked under percent agree with that
filling my skin is so much smoother
using this product it just feel good
it's looking good I mean you could tell
I have you know redness and everything
but the texture is not as bad as it used
to be these are amazing I really love
these products so much and I highly
recommend them and I also have two eye
creams to share with you guys the first
one is one that I was pen is talking
crap about and I didn't think I would
really like it but as I've used it the
more I love it the tatcha luminous deep
hydration firming eye serum this is so
good it's so moisturizing and it makes
your under eyes so smooth I love this
for the nighttime sometimes I'll use in
the daytime as well but mostly for night
just because it is more on the pricey
side and I don't want to like use it all
up like in a month you know I really
love this all you need is like a little
pea-sized amount not even that you just
think the littlest amount and you can
put it underneath your eyes I also put
it on my lids and it just really
moisturizes makes the under eye glow and
I love it so this is one of my new
favorites right now I was having a hard
time finding a good Under
cream or under eye serum that really
moisturized underneath my eyes because I
can always tell a difference like if I'm
using something that's not very
moisturizing but this is awesome I did
have the drunk elephant I think it was
the under eye serum or like moisturizer
that one was nice and it didn't hydrate
as much as I wanted it to so and then
for daytime I have been loving the h2o
Beauty infinity firming eye therapy and
I got this in a PR sale of first off how
compact it is it's just so little it's
like a little nugget and then it does
have a pump on it but I love this for
the daytime because again it's kind of
like the toss yet it's really really
moisturizing but it sinks into the skin
pretty quickly so then when you put all
your makeup on it's already like set and
ready to go and you can put your
concealer on top and it's going to look
flawless and not had a problem with like
my concealer looking cake underneath
here it's always super smooth and I feel
like my fine lines are kind of plumped
up now too because I've been using two
really intense hydrating under eye
products the only difference is I feel
like this sinks into the skin really
quickly so that's why I like two per day
time but this one and this up these are
so good for your under eyes releases
weight a lip balm I've been loving is
the qatari lip balm now normally I don't
talk too much about lip balms because
I'm not like super crazy about it I
could use a drugstore lip balm and you
still don't have to purchase this video
on - you could probably use a drugstore
one and they'll be great but I find that
this will mess on my lips all night long
and it really does moisturize the lips
like it's intense and it feels so good
in the morning I wake up my lips are
nice and moisturize I use this before I
use a liquid lip and it really helps
with the longevity of the liquid lip and
it not cracking the smell just kind of
reminds me of buttered popcorn but it
doesn't really affect me that much
anymore like when I first used to play
on I'd be like oh I don't want this on
my list but it's actually not bad at all
I really love how this moisturizes my
lips and it's just been a favorite I
want to quickly shout out my favorite
cleansing balm and I think if you even
watch me for a while you know what I'm
going to talk about ran out of one
my cleansing oils which I did repurchase
in Sephora haul which you guys saw but I
was using this after I ran it out and I
forgot how much I loved it and all this
out the Leslie coutny give me another
one
just randomly and I was like I love this
balm so much it takes everything off you
don't have to worry about anything being
left on your face because this just
melts it all off to everything just
dissolve so nicely and it does not break
me out so if you have sensitive skin and
you're having a hard time finding a
product that is not going to break you
out that's like a cleanse off oil or
cleansing balm I would recommend this so
the next product is essential for me
because I I have to have it okay we all
know I struggle with like breaking out
on my back it's like one of the things
I'm most insecure about because I
sometimes I just cannot figure out what
the hell's going on and like why it's a
problem one thing that has changed a lot
is I did get a prescribed like
medication from my dermatologist that
I've been using but I feel like this has
really made a difference too because
this is where I used to apply the
product and really clean my back and my
back has been really nice and clear like
I still have some kind of like acne
scars and stuff like that but for the
most part the bad breakouts are gone
like the painful ones you know what I
mean
so this is from opus I can't remember
exactly what it's called but I will
leave it down below for you guys you're
interested in is great for cleaning your
back because it does not hold bacteria
very easy to clean and take care of and
that's why I really love this I think
it's very sanitary which is key for me
when I have to clean my back like I
can't use the little scrubs because it
just holds too much bacteria and it
doesn't help me at all but this has made
such a huge difference all you have to
do it doesn't like a little charger down
here I need to recharge mine actually
maybe just plug it in down here to
charge it and then oh don't do this oh
come on of course and I try to show you
guys is dead but it just vibrates I just
use the first setting and then I scrub
my back I love it because it is a long
handle so you can get right down the
middle get everywhere all over your back
and yeah I really like this so if you're
struggling was back after
and you just really need something to
really clean with that's sanitary I
would go for this because I've been
really enjoying it and it's not too
harsh on my skin let's move on to makeup
the first thing is something I did to
throw that Throwdown on this month and I
just knew I was gonna start using it
again I'm wearing it right now I'm
obsessed with it it is the Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation since you're so
good I'm so happy that there is a series
and like I'm trying things I used to
love because I feel like I'm really
going to find the like Holy Grail
products and really get back into it so
this is one of them I do need to get the
max pump for this if you don't know the
max foundation pumps do sit on these
foundations so that way you don't have
to pour it out but I love it this is
amazing full coverage I have a full
video on it if you want to check it out
down below it where is the aflame
doesn't accentuate my pores and it
covers everything absolutely everything
and then I'm like let me just shout out
my palette I have to I have to these are
the spotlights Smashbox Katie Holmes
collab palettes that I came out with
this month and there's two shades
there's gold and there's pearl so like I
said I'm wearing both of them today
so this one is pearl I've been putting
it to work I love it so much you have
these three shades yes turn it on crank
it up and blow a fuse pearl which blow
fuse is more intense and then you have
this one which is crank it up crank it
up right here blow fuses right here and
then we also have turn it on so there's
the pearl palette and then we have the
gold palette which has a little bit of a
darker packaging on the outside by the
way they do have the names on the back
but this is what it looks like if you
have again turn on crank it up and blow
fuse there's the gold palette right
there this one is so so pretty I use
this pretty much all over my body and my
shoulders when I was at the beach just
to give me a really nice golden glow I
mean obviously I love it because Mike
lab and I worked really hard on it and
I'm so glad you guys are liking it as
well so if you want to check those out I
will have them linked down below this is
the Urban Decay Beach bronzer in bronze
and this is amazing it is so intense and
pretty and it makes you look very very
tan how did it for a while I like the
packaging a lot on this with
product is really great because it
blends out really well and it has that
natural tan look it is a little tiny
orange but to me I think it looks fine
and just kind of see the rings right
here like I think I'm bout to hit pants
now next up is why I've had all my eyes
pretty much all months and I have it on
my eyes right now and it is the Stila
magnificent metals glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadows I have two favorite
colors diamond dust which is more like
silver and we also have smoky storm
which is what I have on my eyes right
now I love these so much but I only love
them if I have my glitter glue
underneath so I use a glitter glue like
toothpaste I have to have it underneath
this product or else the glitter will
just fall out all over my face that is
my personal opinion on them they do have
a lot of Fallout but if you use the
glitter glue you're going to be fine
it's going to stay on the eyes a little
bit more but I taken enough of them I
think they're so intense and pretty and
they're so pigmented like oh that is
diamond dust I mean come on now and then
this one is smoky storm oh my gosh look
at that I mean you can't beat it we want
to shout out the Tarte TARDIS mascara I
guess this was called but this is a
really great mascara I love the
packaging force law I think it's really
pretty
that's the blonde right there kinda
reminds me of the covergirl outlast wand
and I did a video using this I believe
it was my last one that I just posted so
I'll link that down below this is just
one of my new favorites I think it's
beautiful and I love how black it is and
just all of the volume that it gives my
eyelashes is amazing next up we have the
Kat Von D locket brightening powder and
petal this is so good oh my gosh so
happy I tried this out and most of you
know I mean using drum store powders
recently but I was like you know what
let me just try this out let me see if
it's good it's worth it and this is
awesome I just used it just set my under
eyes and it really smooths out
everything doesn't accentuate texture or
pores it doesn't dry out my skin it
doesn't make me only anything like that
it just looks so good and it sets
everything in place beautifully I just
cannot say enough good things about it
I've been
about it constantly when I do say
supplies this is in the shape pedal
really quickly want to shout out this
anastasiya eight to three highlighting
brush this just applies highlighter
perfectly it's right on the top of your
cheekbone and really blends everything
out it grabs the perfect amount of
product if you use it all the time and
then I lost it so I decided to
repurchase it and I now use it with my
palate and I love it so i'm saskya 83 is
a must-have brush okay next favorite is
not makeup related but I love this we
use at the beach we play with it we just
sit in water numerous times it was in
the sand and it's pretty phenomenal it's
pretty phenomenal so this is the JBL
waterproof speaker this is what it looks
like and I'm not sponsored by them or
anything I did get this for free when I
was at New York Fashion Week there was
like so I know what they call it where
like you can go and get free products I
don't know they do that with like
celebrities and stuff which I am NOT a
celebrity but you know when they have
those like goodie bags and stuff that's
what this was so I was able to pick out
what color I wanted and what size and I
mean how pretty is this color it's so
pretty and it's very very very loud and
it has really good base and the music
just sounds really good if you guys know
I love my music can't get enough of it I
have to add music in my life so this is
a must-have and when we go to the beach
or do anything we're definitely gonna
take this with us anywhere we go it also
has like a phone charger here which was
amazing I will be playing my music
favorites office today so you're going
to kind of hear what it sounds like but
is good and it lasts for I believe it's
20 hours yeah I think this is 20 it's a
20 hour battery so I mean that is tea I
have three misses this month and two are
foundations and one is a contour palette
which you're not going to be surprised
about the contour palette because I just
showed in my last video and it was rough
it's meet Sephora contour kit and I was
so excited to try this but it does not
blend very well at all like if you put
on too much product you're pretty much
screwed it's going to be so difficult to
blend and to me it's just not my
favorite formula isn't my favorite and I
really need something that's going to
blend out well so unfortunately this
contour kit did not work out for him
and if you want to see it in action and
fail on me you can check out my last
video next up I did a video on this as
well as the clay to po Butte cream
foundation it has SPF 29 this is 120 ll
foundation and I have very oily skin mr.
Mulligan
it did not last on my skin while at all
it was very like oily and greasy it was
cakey it was just too much for me
believe it or not and I'm a full
coverage kind of person and this was
like whoa again if you want to see that
review I will leave it down below but
this was a no-go for me I was wanting to
do a wear test on this foundation but
favorite video came around like I lost
track of time so let me know if you guys
don't want to wear tests and just see
how this looks on my skin but I cannot
wear this I cannot wear it it is the it
cosmetics confidence in the compact
foundation and I just cannot make this
work for me you guys it was also on my
skin I tried it as a brush I tried it
with a Beauty Blender I've tried it so
many different times it makes my skin
very oily which I know coz it's a serum
foundation it's not going to be like a
matte foundation I got that like when I
first open package install serum
foundation I was a little nervous
because it was like I don't know how
this is going to work with my oily skin
but I want to try it out this sentence
for all skin types it was like breaking
up so bad on my forehead it wouldn't
blend well on me and yeah I have a lot
to cover so if I wear a foundation it
needs to be a full coverage product and
I believe yet it they say this is the
full coverage solid super serum
unfortunately this a cosmetics
confidence in a compact was not good for
me again like I said if you want to see
a wear test let me know in comments and
I'll do that for you I will go out with
some foundation on which is how you know
I love you okay hey you know I love you
because normally I would never step out
with that foundation on my face
those are all my hits and misses for the
month but now we're going to talk about
music and quickly I want to say my
favorite TV show which if you bought me
on snapchat or Twitter you know army
wives is my favorite show with my
favorite show all throughout like the
end of January beginning of February I
watched it go quickly like I went
through all the seasons I will say they
have a very horrible ending like the
ending is
awful and it makes me so frustrated to
even think about it from my season one
through six
it's really really good so be prepared
to cry and have a lot of Kleenexes on
hand because you will cry okay you will
and also know watching Hart of Dixie
because you guys are commended it to me
and I am loving it I'm not close to
being finished with it yet but oh my
gosh I am really enjoying it I love like
little love story type things and I
don't know I love those kind of shows so
I'm really loving hard to Dixie as well
so let me know what kind of shows I
should check out down below I'm a big
fan of like Gilmore Girls Gossip Girl
think of my style so let's stuff like
Sherlock Holmes if you've never seen
Sherlock Holmes on Netflix you need to
go check it out there's long episodes
but oh so good they make you think in
the mess you up they mess you up in the
head you think one thing and then the
next thing is like what alright now I'm
going to move on to music so I'm just
gonna use this little guide I love this
thing so much I wish I was sponsored by
them but I'm not this is how it tells
you how much is charged and we charge
this more we at the beach and I haven't
touched it since and it's still fully
charged so pretty impressive okay so
this is a month that I found a lot of
new songs daylight's a luggable came out
with new stuff you don't know my Spotify
is kch L 91 so you can always check it
out all my playlists are public I
believe one of my new favorite songs

first heard this song I was listening to
it I was like oh what what because you
know Little Mix is a sassy group they
have a lot of attitude and I love it
yeah beep beep is like I would say for
the ground and sexy but you know
okay then the next one is going to be
chained to the rhythm by Katy Perry I
feel like this is going to be like a

Galloway girl by Ed Sheeran oh I love
