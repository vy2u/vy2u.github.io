sharing with you my March favorites and
oh my gosh February was this whole crazy
I've said it a million times I'm gonna
say it again I moved in February if you
don't know and it was just one of the
most busiest months of my life like I'm
still trying to get my life together I'm
still trying to you know do things the
house and make time for YouTube videos
it's just been like ooh one thing after
another February was a really really
really great month I didn't think I was
gonna have like a lot of beauty products
but I do have a few things to show you
guys and of course I have some random
stuff and you know we gotta have the
music favorites the first favorite of
the month is actually you guys now I
wanted to say this because I have
noticed within the past like a month
month and a half we have interacted so
much with each other like with it
whether it's Instagram Twitter and I am
loving it I wake up every morning with
tweets from you guys and what really
makes my day is like we like you get to
know me so well through these videos and
they don't realize that and you get to
know me on Twitter and Instagram and
things and like I wake up I'm not even
kidding every single morning and I have
tons of pictures of like pizza you guys
know I love pizza if you poke me on
Twitter you know I love pizza the amount
of Pizza pictures that I get sent to me
is just like so funny I just I want you
to include you guys more in these
favorites videos so like I'm gonna show
my favorite edit of the month my
favorite thing that was sent and like
anything else like that
the first edit I want to talk about I
actually posted on Instagram so if you
don't follow me on Instagram and make
sure you check it out and just go follow
me and it was the funniest thing it was
from Casey reactions and it says the
Casey Holmes a starter pack and this
just cracked me up so much everything is
so correct and one point that aquas
dying so funny I just oh it was
hilarious so thank you so much Casey
reactions for that that was just so so
funny I'm telling you the amount of pee
the tweets that I get are so funny okay
this is my favorite gif of the month and
it's just so funny and this is from Tina
Tina sent this to me or she tagged me
and I don't know what you call it but
she goes from that to the Cinderella
status of the pizza dress I thought that
was hilarious so again thank you guys so
much for interacting with me more it
really makes my day you have no idea I
just love waking up and seeing your
tweets and knowing that you thought
about me it's like to tag me in
something even if I haven't had a video
up in a week like you're still thinking
of me so thank you so much oh just like
knocked myself out really quickly once
mention a couple of like random
favorites actually just have like one
random favorite yeah and it's coffee and
I've been really at the coffee lately
and usually I like iced coffee but I
can't figure out how to make coffee and
make it iced coffee without melting the
ice and then making it watered-down
coffee I don't know if you know how to
do that at home like make iced coffee
but it's like tastes like Starbucks let
me know I like caramel macchiatos nonfat
so if you know how to make that please
let me know in the comments like at home
because I would love to know so I've
been drinking hot coffee lately which is
different but I've been loving it so my
two favorite flavors is well actually
have three I'll tell you about this
one's the Starbucks vanilla flavored I
also love these Starbucks caramel flavor
all-time favorites love them and then I
also love this one too it's pretty sweet
so if you kind of have a sweet tooth or
something and want something kind of
satisfy that sweetness like that craving
you're having this one from cafe escapes
is in cafe caramel and I like this one a
lot too this one tastes really really
good you don't even need creamer with
this guy it's like that sweet then my
favorite creamer of the month has been
this nest Nestle Nestle Nestle coffee
made to french vanilla and this stuff is
really really good I got the bigger size
this one's actually almost out but I
love this mainly for the Starbucks cups
just because sometimes it can be a
little strong so I'll just put like a
little dab of this in there and it's
like the perfect combo moving on to
makeup which is probably what most you
guys are most interested in
first thing I want to talk about is
something that I've been so excited
about this month that I just like I
can't get enough of and it is the Kat
Von D shade and light palette and I know
everybody is talking about this but
that's because it is amazing
I just adore everything about this
palette you can see I've really been
putting it to work I love this highlight
shade mainly right here for setting
underneath my eyes I think it gives a
really nice a flawless finish like it
just it's it glides on and it doesn't
look cakey or anything like that I just
love it I love this middle shade right
here to bronze whit this is in the color
shadowplay this is a little bit more
warm than the other two so I will bronze
my face with this one and then I will
contour with this shade right here which
is called subconscious right here so I
contour this one bronze with this one
highlight with this one those have been
my main three I think in the winter or
in the winter time let's hope we don't
have winter before summer again can we
not do that don't have my hands we're
not even talk about self-tanner right
now me and self-tanner we're having a
fight and it's just it's winning and I'm
losing well yeah I'm losing I feel like
in the summertime when I'm nice and tan
this will be put to use a little bit
more as well in this highlight you know
for underneath the eyes but so far these
are my three main B's and we've been
loving each other and I just think
they're super easy to work with I also
did purchase the brush with it now okay
and I have not used this side but I have
used it this one for contouring and I
like this one for contouring because
it's that dome shape I know people like
to use this for underneath their eyes
which that's a great purpose too but I
like it because I can just sit there and
really lightly fluff this into my
contour line and it blends it out really
amazingly so I love the light part to
contour with I mean makeup as makeup you
can use tools and makeup however you
prefer so literally Charita just sent me
a pizza picture to see what I mean
everybody sending me Pizza pictures like
so it's so funny this is a really great
product as well but to be quite honest
with you if you don't want to spend the
money on this brush which it's a great
deal because you get two brushes in one
but if you're like me and you're just
using this one Real Techniques has a
contour brush
that you can purchase and use as well so
if you don't want to splurge on this
definitely check out the real technique
ones and real techniques the other thing
I don't have these in the packet to show
you because Rose ate them and I'm kind
of pissed about it because I only wear
them twice and I love them they're the
Isle or London number 126 lashes and you
can reuse these and I loved these lashes
these are from the drugstore I found
these I showed them in my Ulta haul so
if you want to check that out I'll link
my Ulta haul down below oh my god these
are so beautiful they're dupes for girl
you crazy from the Lord which of allures
like 30 these are like less than 10 it's
like a steal they're beautiful and when
you reuse them they don't look cheap and
the problem I have with a lot of
drugstore lashes is that they just can
tend to look really cheap in plastic and
these do not look like that so I'm gonna
go back to Ulta today I'm gonna hunt
down the style and try to find it
because I try finding this style online
but it is nowhere to be found so I'm
like having a panic attack
I need a number 126 in my life please
moving on to concealer this is a newer
concealer and also picked up in the Ulta
haul it is the urban decay and make its
skin weightless a complete coverage
concealer so this is what it looks like
very cute packaging I got the shade
medium light I did have to shave below
this what's just a little too light for
me so I went back and I did get the
shade above it I think this is such an
amazing concealer it really honestly
just blurs out everything underneath
your eyes it looks so flawless and it
just looks gorgeous like I love it I
love the packaging in this too because
it does have like a doe foot applicator
so it's easy just to go
boop-boop-boop-boop blend it out and be
done I do sometimes think of since I do
put this like an upside down triangle
underneath my eyes or whatever sometimes
I do feel like it makes me a little more
oily which I don't like but I always
keep a powder on hand because I get a
little oily here but I mean the finish
of this is so beautiful that I don't
even care I will powder my face all day
long so the urban decay and naked skin a
complete weightless coverage concealer
Wow
a lot it's amazing I'm a really cool
estate I really quickly just want to
shout this braids out I know I shouted
them out I think it was last month but I
can't remember the makeup geek I chose I
have been using non-stop I've posted
pictures on Twitter when I'm doing my
makeup with these I just love them
really quickly
my favorite shadows have been this one
which I believe is Coco bear yes
Coco bear which is a dupe for Mac's
Brown script which I just got on the
bandwagon of makeup geek shadow so you
know bear with me also this is another
color that I just I love this color I
love colors like this it's just been my
thing for the past couple months this is
the shade of bitten and it's like oh
gosh I'm gonna chop it stop it I know
what I'm talking to it I'm just I'm
gonna listen to me I love shades like
this it's so beautiful those have been
my top two and then I also love creme
brulee which is a really nice transition
sharing it right here
and I've also been loving the matte
black that she has and also preppy right
here preppy is really pretty kind of
like a mustard green coming baby puke a
green color but I like those kind of
colors makeup geek shadows I've been
using them a lot I'm gonna do another
video coming up for you guys
it's gonna be affordable makeup and
brushes yeah not everything is gonna be
from the drugstore but it's all going to
be affordable so I'm really excited to
get that video up for you guys
my next video is gonna be a tutorial I
don't know it's probably not gonna be
the affordable one that one's coming
like probably mid next week or the week
after but I definitely have a tutorial
coming for you guys because I miss doing
tutorials and my only issue is I haven't
figured out where I want to sit in my
room like I've been sitting here and
some people don't like it but I like it
it's clean let's talk about lip products
real quick I have been hounded ever
since I mentioned in my Ulta haul about
a Kat Von D Lolita
dupe um for two drugstore products I
forgot to put it in the downbar and I'm
so sorry I've just forgotten I didn't
know the name of this so I'm telling you
now this one's a this look combo from
the drugstore is a dupe for Kat Von D's
Lolita so first off
essence lipliner in soft very what I
like to do with this color is I like to
put this all over my lips this is a
really really gorgeous topi purple color
okay so that's what that looks like and
I just love it this is a very very
creamy lip liner and it's just beautiful
on the lips and it wears really well and
then to top it off I use this NYX soft
matte lip cream in London so that's what
London looks like I like these matte lip
creams I don't like to necessarily buy
themselves but I do like them paired
with a lip liner so that's them too
mixed together absolutely stunning
I've been wearing this all over my
Instagram this month and I have just had
so many questions on it so more than
likely that's where I've been using and
then I have been loving Lolita I've been
loving Lolita mixed with Kashmir by Lime
Crime Kashmir is actually in my purse
downstairs in my car so I don't have it
right now but I love Kashmir it mixed
with this it's just so beautiful so let
me show you on my hand
Lolita looks a little bit more pink but
I'm telling you it looks different on my
hand but I swear to you on my lips they
look exactly the same so this one's
Lolita and this is the one I just mixed
together no but yeah I've been using the
drugstore version a lot more though and
when I do use Lolita I like to mix it
with cashmere from one crime another
lipliner I've been loving I mentioned
this a long time ago I lost it it was
actually one my clutches that are
hanging over there and I just lost this
for a few months and I finally found it
again this is the Lancome but lipstick
okay we do not have to get fancy with
lipstick in nude tan and has a good
brush on one side which I never ever use
and then you have the pencil the other
this is a huge huge pencil have this lip
liner on today I filled in my lips with
this lip liner then I put a matte
lipstick on top but that's the lip liner
right there it's really pretty very very
nice and creamy and it does last for a
really long time but the main thing I
love about this is like it's so creamy
that you could just use this as a
lipstick which I mean I guess since the
name I didn't think I would like
anything from Lancome but I've been
really experimenting with them
since Torino works day or so I've been
experimenting with them and I found some
really good stuff so I love this lip
liner so much
and then last lip liner I want to talk
about is the Palladio Pulido I don't
know somebody corrected me but I can't
remember this is again from a drugstore
and this is in the color gingerbread yes
this is so pretty oh my gosh
I love it I love it I love it again a
very creamy love the color it's just
beautiful and then two lip glosses I'm
gonna talk about our from NYX this
actually came in a set that I ordered
off line on Ulta because and my Ulta
they were sold out of the nude lip gloss
set I don't know the names of these are
absolutely no names on them and I don't
remember the name of the kit but I will
look it up and leave it down below for
you
the kit is absolutely beautiful it comes
with I think five different shades and
mmm I saw them and I was like I mean in
my life I was lucky when I was shopping
online for NYX because I wanted to try
out some new NIC stuff I saw these and I
was like oh the heavens of makeup has
finally come down on me so this is one
of the shades that I love in the kit now
this is a shimmery lip gloss right there
but I love it it makes my lips look nice
and plump and really just beautiful and
these are very pigmented as well but
this one has to be my favorite I wish
they had names but they don't have names
on them I think this is the one that i
swatched in store and I was like I'll
buy the whole set just for you
so that's it right there it's so
pigmented really beautiful I just love
it I have that actually on right now
okay coming off the thing but I love it
oh it's so good and it's really creamy
not sticky at all and then the last two
makeup related item are the last three
make a blur mm okay so the last three
things and makeup wise before we move on
to the music is three tools first thing
I just want to shout out this Real
Techniques Beauty Blender I did for just
another one from Ulta and I've been
loving it who created this does soak up
a little bit more product than the
Beauty Blender but it is half the price
is not more of the Beauty Blender and
it just does the job so I love this very
much I use this side for concealer
underneath my eyes and the side for
foundation I've also been loving this
morphe g7 brush this is actually what I
use when I use the banana color in the
Kat Von D shade and light palette it
just fits underneath the eyes so
perfectly and it just presses that
product in and I just really love it and
I'll actually I like the packaging of
this it's really cute then the last
thing I love pencil brushes I've gone
through multiple pencil brushes I've had
drugstore pencil brushes and I've had
high-end drugstore or high-end and I've
had high-end pencil brushes and let me
tell you nothing nothing topsis Sigma
does not top this nobody tops this this
is my favorite pencil brush of life it
is the Mac 219 brush and I love this and
you're probably thinking oh it's just a
pencil brush no no this thing keeps its
shape so well and the bristles are not
so hard so when I'm sitting here
blending underneath my lower lash line
some pencil brushes like dragged and
they kind of hurt and like the under-eye
starts to burn a little bit and I'm not
like pressing really hard I'm literally
just going back and forth like this but
these bristles like they just they feel
so good underneath the eyes and since
they keep their shape I could do a nice
cut crease and it's just the best pencil
brush of life like I promise you I would
not tell you to go buy an expensive
pencil brush if it wasn't worth it this
is the most amazing pencil brush of life
like it's amazing now let's get on to
the fun part I was gonna mention my
vacuum but I think that's kind of weird
I don't think you guys would be
interested in doing my favorite like
vacuum of the month oh I also got these
things called Sonos they're actually all
around my house it's another favorite of
mine I've really been working on this
house a lot as I've told you guys before
and so knows where the first thing that
I got before I moved into my house
because you guys know I love music I
mentioned every month and I always use
my beats pill but I decided the Sonos
actually are Wireless throughout the
whole house and you navigate it from
your phone so like I have the
right here and this is where it all is
so I could top right here and it says
like what is it
so it says like kitchen master bedroom
media room which we're in the media room
now I could click this I have KITT more
radio on you can just start playing from
all areas of the house like say I'm in
the media room and I want people in the
kitchen to listen to music I can play
here for my media room and I can also go
to the kitchen and play music too
you hear it
they're loud
oh yeah I'm surprised nobody's called
for a noise complaint because I've been
blaring some music so so notes have been
my all-time favorite thing right now I
do recommend them over beats because
first off its louder second off I love I
just love the fact that you can have as
many different speakers hooked up as you
want and even the sound system that goes
with the TV which I want to get but it's
just really really expensive so I just I
love that how cool is that if you
haven't checked out so knows definitely
go to Best Buy check them out they'll
tell you all about them I wasn't in the
market to buy any but I saw them and he
was telling me about them and he sold me
on three so knows but honestly a music
favorite without me music favorites
without this beat pill oh the beats
pills dead never mind we're going to the
Stono so the first song I want to show
you guys is where's that play no games
from Big Sean's new album first off I
download the whole album I never do that
I love the entire album I think it's
amazing but play no games I really fell
in love with it because I saw Ariana's
Instagram post of them like singing and
dancing to a song and has like I guess
what do you call it like release party
or the hearing party they all do and I
fell in love with it and I just love
this song now like I've listened to it
probably 50 times a day
I also love obviously blessings
I love blessings with Drake first off I
love drink too
so this is like a great combination for
me I'm good I'm not a long time you know
a good time and a long time you know I
I'm way of my faithless daddy who has
that one back from something if we're
back on something that subjects yours
I've also been loving somebody send this
to me on Twitter and I was like check it
out why do you do send me songs on
Twitter tell me to check them out and
like always checking them out because
you guys have like great music tastes as
well so supposed to be this is by
Omarion first off where did Omarion come
from I feel like I ever heard from him
forever and it was featuring Chris Brown
songs are the words are obviously um but
it's a good song I like listening to it
and also I've been loving oh I heard
this song from Trey Songz and I was like
oh I love it it's called slow motion I'm
listening to a lot of rap again this
month I love this song
I've been loving this song called track
Queen by Fetty well well I don't know it
I don't know what the name is but I love
this song so much love that song I've
also been loving throw some o'er with
Nicki Minaj and young thug by Rage
