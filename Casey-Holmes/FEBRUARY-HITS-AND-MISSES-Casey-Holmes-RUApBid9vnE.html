be sharing with you my hips and misses
for the month of February oh my said
March I have quite a bit of products to
share with you guys we've got good solid
hits and we've got some solid misses
that I can't wait to share with you guys
so I hope you enjoyed this video if
you're interested in seeing all my
favorites and lots of favorites
definitely keep watching don't forget to
subscribe before you leave if you're not
subscribed already and let's just go
ahead and get started
alright so let's talk about the
favorites okay I incorporated it
something different into my skincare in
the month of February I think also at
the end of January - and I have been
loving it because have I mentioned this
before I don't think I have so I found
oil that really works for me I've been
incorporating this into my nighttime
routine right before I go to bed I like
to put this in with my moisturizer and
it just leaves my skin so glowy so
smooth I just love it I feel so hydrated
it's just one of my favorite oils and
it's by drunk elephant I love drunk
elephant I think they always have
amazing products and they always work
for my sensitive skin so I've been
really enjoying this oil it's the drunk
elephant virgin marula luxury face oil
it's 100 percent fragrance free and high
in antioxidants Omega six and nine
cruelty free has twenty four month span
recyclable but this is what it looks
like and then you just take it out and
it's a little dropper so you can just do
a few drops into your moisturizer you
put this on your body I've put this on
my elbows and like my wrists before I
self tan just to really hydrate that
area there's just such a difference with
my skin when I use this with my
nighttime products I don't know I just
love waking up in the morning having
this gorgeous glow my skin feels plump
it feels really smooth and hydrated even
though my nighttime moisturizer is
amazing Xing this and with it just amps
it up quite a bit and I love it it's an
oil that works for me because usually
oils will make me break out but I have
found one that I love let's talk about
my favorite foundation of the month I
think you guys are gonna know because
it's quite obvious that I have not been
wearing anything else since I got this
foundation it's the LA girl Pro matte HD
foundation and I am so happy I like this
this is just my
favorite foundation at the moment I have
I can't get away from it I have been
wearing this all the time it wears
amazingly looks great in natural light
looks great in fluorescent light it
looks great any time of the day I will
get a little bit oily you know as my day
goes on but it doesn't look like a gross
oily it just kind of looks like I got a
glow and then you know sometimes I like
all right I gotta kind of take that down
a couple notches but it's really pretty
it just wear so well on my skin and I've
been really impressed with this
foundation I don't have anything bad to
say about it other than other than some
of these colors do oxidize the shade I
have on right now is light tan I do feel
like it's a little bit off I had to get
ready without my lights today which I
know is very high maintenance that I you
know was kind of like oh I don't have my
lights but today I was getting ready
only had natural light and I used this
shade and I was like oh this looks great
and I dragged it down my neck and now
I'm like oh it looks a little dark it's
a little bit off right now but I love
this foundation so much I purchased
quite a few shades just so I have one
for each stages of myself tan you know
like when I get really nice to self tan
then when I start gradually getting
lighter I think what I'm gonna do
tomorrow is film a updated like
foundation routine I feel like I haven't
done one of those in so long
but I figured I can mention like all my
favorite drugstore foundations drugstore
concealers kind of show you what I do to
get the full coverage finish and have it
last all day so let me know if you guys
want to see that by giving this video a
thumbs up I think that would be a fun
video for me to film because nobody
films videos like that anymore I used to
love those videos I was thinking about
that today and I think I'm gonna do that
this is 9 to 10 dollars so it's really
affordable one of my favorites ok so
next up I want to talk about this flower
beauty concealer I feel like I kind of
left you guys hanging when I did that
flower beauty video which was my last
video if you guys haven't checked it out
I did like a fool where a test of some
new flower beauty products this was one
of them and um if you saw in that video
when I dusted away my baking it kind of
broke up underneath my cheek and I was
like oh this is not good not that this
isn't good but like you don't want to
bake with it so I have tried this out
many times after that video and I highly
recommend not making this concealer from
me it works best if I just go ahead and
I apply as a sponge to blend it out and
then I go in with my setting powder with
a brush
and I just press it into my skin I don't
do a lot of rubbing I don't let it bake
and dust it away I think that just
causes too much trouble so I'll
literally just take this g4 brush put my
powder on it and I'll sit there and just
Pat underneath my eyes just like this
and around my face wherever I put
concealer and usually I'll just go ahead
and set my face at that time as well
this is definitely one of my favorite
drugstore concealers has come out in a
really long time I enjoy using it I love
the way it looks I especially love it
with the LA girl Pro matte foundation I
think they look beautiful together to me
this does have more of a matte finish
it's very long wearing doesn't sink into
my fine lines anything like that it's
just a good product so smooth and creamy
they call this yeah it's the light
illusion full coverage concealer the
shade I use underneath my eyes is the
shade light and then if I want to
conceal on my face I will use the shade
light/medium as well next up I want to
talk about my favorite powder at the
moment is the makeup revolution luxury
baking powder lace this one is the
banana shade one I love this powder it
sets my makeup so well it also brightens
up the skins it is that banana shade it
doesn't give you a white cast anything
like that actually watched talked to use
video of her using this powder and I
think she used the white one and I was
like no the banana one is so good so I
really recommend checking this out it's
really great it says the natural heat
from your body will cook powder over
base foundation or concealer concealer
giving you a flawless finish and I had a
percent agree with that it doesn't give
you like a dry matte finish or anything
like that to me it just sets really well
keeps everything locked in for a long
period of time sometimes I do have to go
in with some extra powder after I've
blotted but for the most part that keeps
me matte for the full day especially
with this foundation and then the flower
Beauty concealer it's a winning combo so
I love those drugstore products hasn't
been like my everyday go-to products if
you guys can see my Instagram I've been
doing a lot of this look right here
where I just do like either a bold lip a
new lip and then some mascara and I just
do my face you guys know that's like my
favorite look to do half the time other
than really smoky dramatic looks that's
what I've been doing for my face but I
also have been using at this product
that I just love and it is the Bobbi
Brown a vitamin enriched
facespace and I got this sent to me in
PR so happy I did because I've always
been so curious about it because I've
heard so many great things about this
product I have to say it's a really
really great product I like to use this
product on my skin's looking a little
bit dull dehydrated sometimes that does
happen for me especially if I go from
washing my face and then I wait a few
hours and then come in here I need
something to kind of liven up my face a
little bit this product is great if I
just need it a little extra something
especially with the really cold air out
here at drum this is awesome because it
doesn't leave a greasy film anything
like that it really does hydrate that
skin sinks in really quickly you can use
it underneath foundation and you're not
gonna have a problem okay so next up I
want to talk about this thing that is
the size of my face this is one of my
favorite sponges and people like every
time I use this in a video some people
will be like what the heck is that
it's a sponge this is the Real
Techniques a miracle face and body
sponge you guys this is so good for your
face you can get your makeup on in no
time I love it so it comes in a box like
this it does look like the original Real
Techniques sponge but it does say
miracle face and body sponge so you want
to get the one that also says body on it
as well and it's just ginormous I mean
obviously it's just the biggest sponge
ever but that's why I love it because
you can really just apply everything so
quickly and then you can also use it for
your body if you want to take some
liquid highlighter go on your shoulders
down your chest this is a great way to
do that you can use a sponge for that as
well actually bought a backup because I
lost one of my other sponges and I was
like I can't be without this sponge so I
bought two another sponge I want to
recommend to you guys if you're looking
for more of a normal sponge is the Sonia
Kashuk one so Sonia Kashuk like revamped
everything they've got a lot of great
stuff out right now at Target this is
one of them it is a Sonia Kashuk makeup
blender duo you get two in this packet I
wish I could wear how much this was but
I really like this sponge a lot I've
been using this one like crazy kind of
like saving this one too you know I
don't want to get a too dirty just yet
this is what it looks like I love the
shape of this because you can just set
it on your desk and it's not going to
roll around everywhere has a nice pointy
end and it does get a little bit bigger
and gets nice and squishy it's not as
soft and squishy as
real techniques one but it still is
really great comfortable to use and I
like it a lot
try it out a few brow products this
month got some favorites so favorites
that I didn't even think I would like to
though first off we have the Catrice
ultra slim attic brow pencils love this
actually just ran on it this one today
so I'm officially out of medium and
light right this is like yes medium and
light are my two favorite shades I'll
use medium from here out and then light
here in the inner part of my brow love
them they are so easy to use if you just
aren't great at pencils like myself you
will love these because I swear they
just glide on they're so easy to blend
out and I've just been really enjoying
these products I love that they have a
spoolie on the end they're just perfect
the formula is everything and I don't
know there's something about these that
I just can't get enough of and then I
also have this flower beauty tattoo
effect stain in the video you guys saw I
tried the shape taupe and I had like a
red undertone it was just a little weird
so when I was in Ulta the other day I
did buy the shade soft brown because I
really liked how this applied and how
quick it was I just needed a different
color so I got a soft brown love it I
have soft brown in most of my brow now I
just used this up today like to fill in
this part and the top part of my brow as
well but I really like this I just think
it's so easy to use you like this just
fills in those little areas but if you
want to be more precise I would
definitely get like a small pencil like
this just to go in and really touch up
areas make it nice and clean but this is
a great quick way to get your brow down
moving on to favorite mascara and this
actually surprised me too because when I
saw it come out I wasn't super excited
about it which I don't know I guess cuz
I really don't get excited about my
scares cuz I normally wear false lashes
but I have to say I love this one and I
love it more than the roller lash and
you guys know I love the roller lash the
benefit BADgal bang mascara so this is
the sample size they sent me the sample
size and the full size and PR I decided
to go with this first cuz I want to see
if I liked it or not and if I was gonna
keep the big size I love it that's what
is on my lashes now it gives so much
volume length I love it I love it I love
it I love it it's such a good mascara
gives more volume than the benefit
roller lash in my
and to me it just looks really good I
love the volume that it gave and it
separates it's just awesome so packaging
is really cute too it's just like a
matte black and then that's what the
brush looks like it's just a nice
rubberized wine
so that is in my favorite mascara now
I'll move on to a blush palette I've
been using I've been really enjoying
this Cokie cosmetics blush up blush
palette it's like all peachy tones love
this I've been mixing this shade and
this shade together a lot and then
sometimes I'll mix them all together and
I just think they look really great I
have them on today just gives like a
nice warm peach look to your cheeks you
can build up the color as well to get a
nice intense pigment but I just really
enjoyed this palette it's my colors you
know the warm tones I got these palettes
and I these are kind of newer purchases
pretty new one of them is pretty new but
let me tell you you just know you just
know when you get it and you put it on
your face that this is it this is the
one these are the one and let me show
you so we've I literally said let me
show you my camera shut off I've got two
highlighter palettes from drugstore that
are a hundred percent worth your money
this one right here is from Milani so
it's the Milani rose glow stellar lights
palette you have pearl right no pearl
golden quartz rose gold these are
stunning these are really really intense
very creamy very buttery I mean they are
just oh my gosh in sane absolutely
beautiful colors I highly recommend this
palette so much there is quite a bit of
shimmer in here it's not like chunky
glitter or anything like that but just
be aware it is in this palette to me I
feel like it blends so well and it just
ends up melting and kind of looking like
a buttery glow I don't have it on right
now but you about to see what I got on
okay so this one's a really new purchase
tried it out loved it think I love this
more than the Milani one I just I can't
get enough of it it's what I have on
today I was so surprised I mean I put my
fingers in at all time I was like wow
this is good but I didn't expect it to
be this good so this is the makeup
revolution soap X highlighter palette
and wow this is what the palette looks
like you have such great shades in here
I love this palette because you can kind
of see by looking at it the different
formulas these are very intense kind of
like metallic wet looking highlights
these are wet looking highlights to get
a lot of color and a lot of shine but
it's not going to senshu eight your
texture so let me just show you what I'm
talking about look at these colors these
are so pretty you guys like they're a
wet looking highlight they look
absolutely stunning on the skin it's
what I have underneath my brow right now
it's been quite a few hours since I've
had my makeup on so this stuff is good I
want to show you it but like I don't
want to put too much on oh let's do it
to show you this shade right here cuz
this one I was like good board you get a
lot on your brush I barely touched that
powder and you get so much off of it and
then literally where do I even put this
okay
do you see that highlight it's one of
those highlights you put on your skin
and you're like oh my god this looks so
good and you can't stop alright next up
I want to talk about something that's in
between a hint Animus and that's for one
reason only so when I first tried this I
was like wow this is amazing it's so
dark and it is but there's something I
like better so I did try out these Saint
Tropez bronzing new muse I did try out
the same Tropez bronzing mousse self tan
extra dark this is the darkest one that
they have I'm pretty sure when you put
this on you're like holy cow I am tan
and you are you are dark this is
probably the darkest color guard that
I've ever used with a self-tanner it is
really really intense I feel like when
you first apply this all over you kind
of feel like it looks a little messy but
I promise you once you wash it off that
color guard just goes away and you have
this nice gorgeous tan so like I was
saying when you apply this it is very
very dark and then you wash it off the
next day and you have a good self tan
this is the color that I am in my
opinion it's not super dark I think the
color guard is definitely the darkest
I've ever tried
I got really
excited whenever the color guard was
that dark so I was like wow the self-tan
is gonna be so dark I'm going to be tan
Tanner than loving tan and you're not
once you wash off that color guard it's
definitely not darker than the loving
tan ultra dark one in my opinion but it
does give you a really nice color in my
opinion it gives you more of like a dark
self tan there's definitely a difference
between dark and ultra dark so loving
tan ultra dark is still my number one
this one goes right behind it and then
there's nothing after that one thing I
will say that's different between this
one and loving tan loving tan is pretty
hard to get off but this comes off
pretty easily let's talk about these
misses though first miss actually tried
on a facebook live it is the BH
Cosmetics Studio Pro a total coverage
concealer this was so thick and heavy on
my skin it did not look good at all it
was just way too much it was major cake
face really accentuated pores and
texture it was just awful this is a no
from me would never use this again
another concealer is the makeup
revolution conceal and define I know a
lot of people either love this or you
hate it and I'm the one that does not
like this because it is very very dry on
my skin I posted a video actually using
this and you can really see what it does
to my under-eye it's just too dry for me
and it just didn't work out and it
didn't have as much coverage definitely
the flower Beauty one has more coverage
in my opinion and just looks a little
bit better underneath my eyes than this
one does so had to pass on the makeup
revolution conceal and define concealer
but some people love it so feel free to
try this next product I was so surprised
about because I put it on and I was like
ok this is pretty what video is it I use
it in a video I don't think you guys
have seen it yet well you're gonna know
this now booboo move were you watching
the video this is the cover FX
shimmervale and it's like a shimmery
eyeshadow I put it on my eyes and first
off it was like hard to like blend and
make look kind of seamless with the rest
of my eyeshadow I've used liquid
eyeshadows before that are a little bit
easier to you know work with this one
was pretty difficult and I'm not kidding
you when I wore this throughout the day
it literally came off my eyes I don't
even know where it went did like float
in the air I have no idea
I don't ever rub my eyes but you guys I
had this all over my
right here and it was gone by the end of
the day I was like where the hell did it
go I didn't even touch my eye cover FX
has amazing products but this was a pass
for me if it can't even last on my eyes
there's no sense in buying it in my
opinion next up is the driest lip liner
of your life you do not want to try this
out I don't know if these are duds but I
opened them out the package use them and
they weren't good for me so it is the
rocker chick Velvet Touch waterproof gel
lip liner from Jake at beauty I'm
telling you these are the most
uncomfortable lip products they are so
dry they make your lips feel like
they're like going in like this it's
just it's not good so despise this lip
liner even though the color is so pretty
the formula is just awful these two just
didn't do anything for my lashes again I
did feature these in a video we have the
Catrice glam and all false lashes
mascara which is waterproof which really
isn't waterproof because I got this off
pretty easily so we also have the
Catrice blamin doll volumizing mascara
primer this didn't create any more
volume for me I even use this on my
benefit roller lash didn't really do
much for me last but not least I have
come to the conclusion that this is a
Miss for me I feel like after my flower
beauty video I could I just really
couldn't decide and now since I've been
using it I just feel like it's not worth
the money you have three eyeshadows two
blushes a bronzer and a highlighter
highlighter is not as intense as her
normal highlighters that if you've tried
out her like shimmer strips before I
don't know if they're called shimmer
strips but she has a palette with
highlighters that are very pigmented
absolutely stunning this really isn't
that for me again I do think this is
more of like a toned down makeup look
this is something for someone who wants
a palette to go to for every single day
something that's not too intense you're
not blinding people with your highlight
when you're out and about which is fine
not a lot of people want to wear
highlights that people are like wow what
is on your face you know what I mean
people have different makeup preferences
and I definitely think this is for like
the everyday I just want a simple makeup
look let me just have it all in one
palette and throw it on or someone like
me this one definitely just doesn't work
out because I need a little bit more
from this I don't like this bra
because it's a little too red it does
have some shimmer in there which I do
not like it all these eyeshadows are
nice I like the maps more than the
shimmer I feel like if you like these
eyeshadows you should definitely try out
this flower beauty shimmer and shade
eyeshadow palette this one's in gold and
natural these are hella pigmented so
pretty and you're gonna get more shades
in this so if you're just solely buying
this just for those eyeshadows get this
palette and you're gonna really really
enjoy this because they're nice and
pigmented they look really great and you
have all the shades in here in here as
well so I think that's it for all my
beauty hits and misses that was crazy
that was a lot of stuff but we're
through it and we're good to go to the
song favorites in this video it's gonna
be like 30 minutes long but it's fine
also my nails are another favorite I
kind of did something a little bit
different which for some people this is
like the basic of basic but this is
different for me so my nails are my
favorite too because I actually did
something not green oh my gosh I love
psycho with post Malone and Thai dollar
sign I just heard this song so don't
know all the words but I love I just
love this I love post Malone and like
his boys it's just so soothing I love it
this next one is heaven by Julia
Michaels you guys I love this songs of
it every time I hear this stir-fry song
from me goes I think of the tasty video
on Facebook so funny best thing I've
ever seen in this song I think of it
every single time it just cracks me up
okay so you guys know I love Drake this
song look alive featuring Drake by block
boy JB I'm filming my song favorites if
you want to come in to your favorite one
I think the only other song that I can
think of to play that I've been really
loving is one that I feel like would be
great for the lake this just sounds like
one of those songs that you'd be on the
lake drinkin like
hey guys so that is it for today's video
I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching I'm sorry I
didn't have a lot of song favorites
