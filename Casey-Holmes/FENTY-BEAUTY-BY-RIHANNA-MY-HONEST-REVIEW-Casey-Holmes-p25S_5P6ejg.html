so today we are gonna be doing another
Finn T review I know I know these have
been all in your subscription feeds and
you've been seeing this everywhere I
waited to do this because I didn't want
to do a first impression I really wanted
to try everything out and get my
opinions on it and let you guys know
what I didn't think what I didn't think
I think for such a really insane huge
brand that is like taking over the
freakin makeup world it's important to
review it instead of doing a first
impression I will say I have been a
little bit nervous to film this just
because I don't like everything that I
have here and I don't want to you know
offend anyone even though people will
probably get offended anyways things
that I don't necessarily like isn't it
because of who it's by it's not to
downgrade you know the amazing color
selection that they have it's just that
some products don't work the same for
everyone everyone has different skin
texture different oils they're dry
they're combo I mean there's so many
factors that go into different opinions
that sometimes things just don't work
out and it's not because the brand sucks
just because some products don't work
the same for one person as they do for
the other one I don't think I'm bashing
this brand if I don't like a couple
products because I do believe that this
brand is amazing the way they came out
with a bang
they're here for every skin color so if
you're interested in seeing at my Fenty
review and demo definitely keep watching
and don't forget to subscribe before you
leave let's just go ahead and get
started so I did not buy everything from
the collection just because I didn't buy
things that I felt like I went news so I
do not have trophy wife in this and I
don't have like a contour match stick so
the things that I have is like the
foundation the primer I have a concealer
stick I have the translucent powder I
purchased a brush the sponge all this
different kinds of stuff so I'm just
gonna show you guys what I purchase
first product we have here is the soft
matte pro filter primer I've tried this
with different foundations I've tried it
with the Fenty Beauty one I've also
tried it with my favorite foundations
and I'm gonna be honest this is a nice
primer it feels really good but for me
and my texture skin I need something
that's really gonna fill in pores and
blur out the skin I don't feel like this
really blurs out my pores it does kind
of have that lotion II texture which is
not bad at all but I just need something
a little bit more pore filling you do
get one point eight fluid ounces in here
which
more than your average primer which i
think is amazing I also love the
packaging I know some people have been
comparing this to the k'kaw and I don't
know if it's just because I haven't
really experimented with k'kaw much but
I don't see a super-intense resemblance
I mean yeah they have the pinky nude but
I don't think they're really similar in
my opinion I think they both are two
completely different brands I'll be
interesting to see what Kim comes out
with later on like any foundations or
anything like that I don't know I just
don't see a super big similarity but I
get it with the colors but I do like
fenty beauty's packaging a lot I think
it's really great I love the frosted
glass and I love the fact that it has a
pump but I will say if I could go back I
would not buy this primer just because
it's not something I like to use I
personally don't feel like it keeps me
that throughout the day and it doesn't
fill in my pores so for me this just
wasn't my all-time favorite but it's not
a horrible primer I think it's just
gonna depend on what you're looking for
when you purchase the primer okay so
moving on to the foundation I got three
different foundations I ordered all this
when I was in New York and I was like
I'm gonna have one shade for any time
I'm self too and or not self tan so we
have 220 to 60 to 90 right now I am
wearing this shade to 90 I feel like
it's the perfect shade for me again with
the frosted glass 1.8 fluid ounces it
does say to shake well so I highly
recommend doing that this is more of a
liquidy consistency like it does run
fairly quickly I'm like a broken record
I know on YouTube saying this but I know
a lot of people say that this oxidizes
on them I don't see it oxidizing I know
the makeup artist came out and said you
know it just gets darker like it gets to
the true color and I completely agree
with that I don't see oxidizing it
doesn't go orange on me or anything like
that it does get darker but it gets to
the color that it's supposed to be I
don't I don't have any complaints about
that I have never had an issue is color
matched me perfectly and I was fine and
I've also used the lightest shade that I
have which is 220 and I again did not
have an issue with this again you do
have a pump right here which I enjoy I
love the fact that these two have like
that same packaging so this foundation
does have a more medium to full coverage
finish I personally like to apply it
with a brush if you use a sponge sponge
gonna really soak up that product
because it's such a liquidy product I
believe the first ingredient is water
which is why it's
liquidy and I would recommend not using
it with a sponge because it's just gonna
still get right up I personally like to
use it with a flat top brush you do get
more of a medium to full coverage finish
I wouldn't say it's completely full
coverage right off the bat but it does
build up to a full coverage finish I
personally don't like this foundation I
find that every time I use it I don't
like the way my skin looks I feel like
since I have so much texture because I
do have rosacea this emphasizes it quite
a bit even if I do put a blurring primer
on it just looks too textured for me
another thing I don't like is it doesn't
stay on my nose very well now this one
thing happened to me the other day where
I was drinking my green tea and it
accidentally came out in my mouth
because I can't control myself obviously
but the liquid came out and there was
just a Shrike down my face where the
foundation just moved so it is far from
waterproof so far from water proof just
so you guys know but I haven't
experienced like a line coming down my
face from drinking something in it
running out in a while not just because
normally I can contain my liquids in my
mouth normally the foundations I go for
stay put no matter what like I could
have rain droplets fall on my face and I
don't have any issues I don't have any
dots all over my face but if I were to
wear this out and it was sprinkling I
would have little dots all over my face
I just know it because that line I had
was so prominent that I had to go back
in with foundation and blend it out I'm
wearing all the Fen TV stuff right now
on my face and I do not like the way my
skin looks I feel like I look more dry I
feel like my texture is very enhanced I
think if you don't have a lot of texture
you're gonna really like this product
because it is a nice like matte kind of
soft powder finish I do like the
coverage of it I like a good medium to
full coverage finish I think that's
great I think the end result is nice
unfortunately this one is not good for
me no matter what primer I use it just
doesn't work and it's just not my
favorite personally but I know a lot of
people love it so I would recommend
getting a sample and testing it out now
she does have so many shades she has 40
shades in this she came out with a bang
and was like you you you you and you are
gonna get a shade and I think that's
amazing and that's what kind of makes it
hard for me to come on here and say I
don't really like this for my skin
because there's a lot of issue with my
skin tone or anyone else's skin tone
that I've seen so far it's just I don't
like the way it lays on my texture in my
rosacea she has a ton of shades you're
bound to find one that's at least
remotely close to your face I do want to
talk about this sponge real quick like I
told you guys I don't like to use it
with that foundation because it soaks it
all up but I also don't like this oh I
also find that this soaks up concealer
like crazy I went to blend out concealer
with this I was using my Torchic tape
and my Maybelline fit me which is what I
always use and it just soaked everything
up and it wasn't even and nothing really
blended well this is why I've been so
nervous to film this review because like
I I'm not trying to bash this brand
whatsoever it's just the experience I've
had but the most of this stuff hasn't
been great and I've been trying to make
it work and I just can't remember I am
one and a hundred bazillion people in
this world that has probably this
opinion but I'm just trying to be honest
I have nothing against Rihanna
Briana's amazing she's absolutely
stunning and you know this makeup line
is awesome but just certain things
didn't work for me yeah I found that
this soaked up a lot of my concealer the
Tarte shaped tip just was an ass full
coverage believe it or not I still
prefer my L'Oreal sponge so let me know
if you guys have used this with your
favorite foundation just use it with
concealer and so far I'm not a fan of it
moving on to the match stick we have the
french vanilla matchstick here and I've
tried this different ways I've tried
just swiping it which you guys will see
both ways in the video where I try
putting it underneath my eyes just
straight on and I've also tried warming
it up and then applying it with a brush
I can't do it my fingers because my
nails I don't like this product at all
because I find that it makes me look so
dry and the one thing I will say this is
okay for is highlighting the face but
even on my nose here which you guys will
see in the demo it just breaks up so bad
it's not looking as smooth as I prefer
and this really makes my under eyes dry
did get some mascara right here and I
just grazed over it just a little bit
and press down hard to get that mascara
flake off after it dried and it took off
the concealer it's just not my favorite
thing
I don't think warming it up makes it any
better if you like more of a medium
coverage product you might like this but
I wouldn't use it if you
dry under eyes I feel like I don't
really have dry under eyes I moisturize
really well but this seems to make them
look pretty dry for some reason this one
just wasn't a favorite of mine at all no
matter how I applied it I didn't really
like it I like that all of these are
magnetic
I find it aesthetically pleasing because
it looked so pretty I can't speak for
the contour but for the concealer I just
wasn't a big fan of using this
underneath my eyes moving on to star
sroa I actually really like this I like
it better when you warm it up and apply
it with a brush the brush I like to use
with it precise highlighting brush from
Smashbox so you I just sit there warming
up on my skin and then I take it with
the brush and apply two tops of the
cheekbones I like that better than just
going directly on to the cheek because
if you go directly onto the cheek
sometimes it just doesn't blend out as
well and look as diffused warm it up use
it with a brush and it looks fine this
is a very shimmery sparkly color but I
do really like that thing it's pretty
and on the lid it is really nice as well
I actually have this underneath my brow
bone to highlight and I think this is a
great like multi-use product like for
your face for your eyes you can use it
on your body so here is star-struck
right there very pretty very very very
reflective I'm going to show you French
vanilla as well you can kind of see it's
just like a really thick dry formula
this one right here so I think that's
why I just didn't work for my under eyes
moving on to something I really like it
is this venti beauty and visit matte
blotting powder I was so excited to try
this and also it has that same magnetic
brush right here and it's just a
translucent powder so you open it up and
you have the sponge which I have used
multiple times I always keep the sponges
because you never know when you need
them when you're out even though I did
buy the brush I always keep this on hand
but I like this because it's a very it's
a very thin powder if that makes any
sense like it's so soft it's something
that when you put your finger in it
you're not gonna get a lot of product
but it really distributes on the skin
beautifully and it just softly mattifies
the face it's not like you're adding on
a ton of powder back onto your face it
just goes back in sets the makeup and it
makes you have a flawless matte finish I
do like this powder it does have a nice
mirror and if you're wondering the brush
is
nice when I first got it it came like
this and I didn't realize this little
metal piece went up and down so I went
to put this on and I was like um no no
but then I realized you have that tip
right there
to push it up so you don't ruin the
bristles so props to them from
remembering that because a lot of brands
don't remember that yes it looks pretty
when you take it out the first time but
you get you get to put it back in so
they thought about that and I think
that's amazing but I really like the
packaging and the fact that the brush is
magnetized
moving on to highlighters these
highlighters have been everywhere mainly
trophy wife I do not have trophy wife
mainly because I just didn't want to
purchase it because I knew I wouldn't
use it but it does look beautiful on
pretty much everyone that I have seated
on so trophy wife is amazing for like
tan to deeper skin tones or you could
get it if you're lighter and use it as
eye shadow though I have two shades so
this one is the fire crystal lightning
dust these are the kilowatt freestyle
highlighter duos and then we also have
mean money and hustla baby which is more
of the golden one just can't ever get
these open Amy it's okay I'm a little
nervous because there's got my nails
done if I break one I'm gonna be so
upset
I love the packaging of this I just I
think the packaging of the whole
collection is spot-on I think it's great
though again this one is more of the
golden tones and then we have more of
like the pinky champagne tones this one
is my favorite the lightning dust and
fire crystal I think it's really
beautiful now you do have two
highlighters in these you have one that
is pretty subtle and then you have one
that's like really intense and shimmery
the way I like to use is if you have a
lot of texture here at the front and you
don't want to bring highlighter all the
way for you can just use this like glow
powder I'm going to call this a glow
powder because that's how I feel it
looks like so this is like more of the
glow powder it doesn't have any shimmer
in there it's just a really beautiful
sheen so you can bring this all the way
down if you wanted to if you wanted to
really make that highlight pop down here
and then you can go right in the middle
of the cheekbone with this one which is
fire crystal that definitely has more
shimmer has a lot of shimmer in it and
it is going to emphasize texture if
you're not careful so I like the fact
that they have two different formulas in
here they're the two swatch this one's
the one without the glitter this one is
the one with like the high shine I think
that's good for people with texture so
you can layer these and
these were for Jesus right on the center
as like that pop so I do like that and
then I like this one as well I'm gonna
go ahead and swatch them for you guys do
you feel like the more glowy powder and
this one is not as intense as the other
one but it is still pretty nice so there
are those two shades right there very
pretty golden colors you like more
golden tones you would probably really
like this and I also like the fact that
they have the mirror on the inside I
have used this brush and I do like it I
still prefer the Smashbox one I just
wanted to test this out because I
thought it was so cool I feel like it
really does cup your cheek very well but
sometimes I feel like it applies too
much high light I'm like it's too thick
so that's why I like something like this
it's a little bit smaller and more
precise that I can get right here on the
tops of my cheekbones so that is
everything that I bought from the Fenty
Beauty line if you don't know if NT is
Rihanna's last name I feel like
everybody said it so I didn't want to
like come full forward with a bunch of
info people already told you even though
it's whole videos things probably people
have already told you really hope you
guys enjoyed it this is a very inclusive
line if you're having a hard time
finding shades I would highly recommend
checking it out I also recommend getting
samples before you buy if I could do it
all over again I would go get samples of
the foundations instead of buying all
three of them but it ain't no thang but
if you're going to go ahead and take it
back you know what I'm saying so I
wasn't mad at the fact that she didn't
have eyes shadows because let's be real
we have a ton of eyeshadows out
right now I hope you guys enjoyed this
review and didn't take offense to the
products that I didn't like just because
I have a different skin texture than
most people I do think it's awesome that
people that couldn't find foundations to
match them before can find now and I
think it's just gonna get better from
here and you know the first launch is
just the first launch I mean she still
has years to go and she could change up
different things come out with different
foundations like luminous foundations
concealer like liquid concealers you
know there's so much left for her to do
now but at least you always know she's
always gonna have a shade for you you
know what I'm saying but thank you guys
so much for watching if you've tried
this brand let me know down below what
you think in the comments what you love
which you didn't really like so much and
don't forget to subscribe before you
leave and I will see you all in my neck
