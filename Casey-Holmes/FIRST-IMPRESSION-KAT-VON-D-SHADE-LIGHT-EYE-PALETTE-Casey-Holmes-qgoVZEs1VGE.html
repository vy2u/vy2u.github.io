first impression for you guys because I
haven't done one in a while and when I
received this palette I was like yes I
wanted to do a review on it I have not
seen anybody really talk about I haven't
looked at reviews or anything so this is
like a legit first impression but I
looked it up on Sephora before I started
filming and I wanted to tell you guys
how much it was and it's 46 dollars but
this has a 5 star rating and there's 313
reviews and 10000 loves on Sephora so I
think that's saying something for the
palette I do love the contour palette
which is just called the shade and light
palette but when I saw this and I looked
at the colors I was like oh my god it's
beautiful
and I've had pet von d palette before
and I love them they're very very
pigmented easy to blend so I'm excited
to see how I like this one so this is
what the palette looks like I love all
of this I'm pretty sure she designs all
of this which i think is really cool and
then it shows on the back all of the
colors you have warm shades neutral
shades and cool shades so let me open it
up and show you and they also give you a
little instructional guide which is
really cool again and it does have I
believe this is Spanish I don't know my
languages but has a Spanish side and an
English side so that's what it looks
like so you can see the warm or sorry
the warm quad cool and neutral and then
you can see right here depending on what
your eyes they gave you a little I have
a squat on your bed so they're just
their children so they have a few
tutorials right here for you so you can
define eyes lifts eyes and poor balance
eyes I need to lift I'm sorry that my
ring light is kind of casting a thing on
her I like to lift my eyes because I do
have more tech down turn eyes people
always say that my looks look the same I
use this same technique over and over
again because I want to lift my eyes
that's because of my eye shape that's
just what to do so keep in mind with
tutorials you can use the same colors
but you just want to kind of switch up
your technique depending on your eye
look and it should
work out for you so I loved that she
included this and like little
instructions I think that's awesome I
love this because some people don't know
you know that there's makeup tutorials
on YouTube so I think this is great for
the people that don't know about it
so you open it up and the palette looks
just like the outside and then also has
the name was on it as well which is
great has the same mirror as the contour
palette does and then here are the
shades so again you have the warm cool
and a neutral very very gorgeous colors
does me just ma'am I'm trying to film
she gave me the side eye can i film
without you knowing on a bone just for
like a few minutes that okay and they're
all matte which is amazing okay so what
we're going to do I've applied my
eyeshadow primers and everything so
models are prepped and ready to go and
I'm actually going to follow more of the
smoky eye technique before our lifted I
figured I'll go along with what's inside
the palette just so if you are new and
you are just purchasing this you can
follow along and watch a tutorial
instead of just reading it as well but I
figured this would probably be helpful
for you guys hopefully so yeah we're
just going to follow the lifted eyes
smoky one so yes keep in mind you can do
this the same exact toriel just follow
which ones they prefer for your eyes you
could use the same colors whatever you
want to do so okay for the smoky eyes it
says apply base all over eye and blend
upwards towards the brow now it does
have base contour defined highlight so
it's it's just an easy thing to follow
the main thing I think with this is
picking out what shade you want now you
can mix and match the shades you don't
have to stick to just one quad you can
do whatever you want to do I love my
warm shades but I think I'm going to go
with a neutral one today so I'm going to
use this one right here so this is the
base and we're going to apply this all
over the lid and
to the brow as the little pamphlet says
that's what it's called it's called
pamphlet I don't know why I couldn't
think of that earlier pamphlet I like
this too because it's kind of a yellow
tone powder and I know everybody's like
obsessed with yellow tone powders but
this just looks really good I feel like
on the skin and this is a really
pigmented eyeshadow I've never had a
problem with Kat Von D's eyeshadows not
being pigmented I've had probably three
pallets no probably more because when I
used to have like her little quads that
were really tiny and cute I used to have
like four of them and I loved them so I
had to get rid of a milk expired movies
and then it says place highlight on the
inner lid and does softly on Bravo so
this one is the highlight for this quad
and I'm going to take a smaller kind of
precise brush I'm going to take this one
from Sigma is the e at 56 it's kind of
smaller we're just going to go in that
highlight shade and put it right here in
the inner corner I like to take my
highlights from the inner corner to
about halfway on the lid just so when we
start blending other colors it'll kind
of seamlessly blends together and it
just looks really good so I'm going to
put this again under my brow can you
stop smacking please my her she she like
does this thing where she gnaws on her
toys and she just like no no no no no
you need to stop is not cute okay so the
highlight is down and then it's a sweet
contour shade on how to crease area with
a blending brush to accentuate all right
now that's the wrong one huh add contour
to crease area in outer corner - belén
so contour shade is this one wrapped
here so I'm just going to take this kind
of brush right here which is the Sigma
e25 I like this one because it's a
little bit more controlled than the
fluffy blending brush and these shades
are a little bit darker for the contour
shade so I like to use more of a smaller
blending brush than the big you know
fluffy one
so just tap off the excess and then like
it says blend it on the outer corner and
into the crease now this tape that I
have on my eyes if you've never watched
my channel before um what it does is it
creates a sharp line for the eyeshadow
so like since I do have down turn eyes
and I'm doing the tutorial for that once
you take this off the I show is gonna be
angled up so it's going to give the
illusion that your eyes are lifted and I
just feel like you don't have to use
tape you can use a credit card and put
it right beside your eye I just find
tape easier just make sure you put the
tape on the back of your hand and peel
it off a couple times so most of the
sticky glue comes off and it doesn't tug
at your eyes so I just think it's easier
especially for beginners you just want
to angle it up from your lower lash line
up like that if you have more down turn
eyes and it really really makes a huge
difference and it's so easy to do so
there's just a little tip for ya
if you were wondering it I know some
people probably like watch that tape on
her eye that's why so we're just gonna
blend this out I have to take my crease
colors or like contour shades as she's
calling them right above my crease since
I do have kind of like downturn eyes and
I don't have like a ton of lid space I
like to just put it up above the place
just a little bit and I am going to take
that fluffy blending brush and just
blend it out shades are really really
nice so far at blending so I'm pretty
impressed okay and then it says to use a
smudge brush Pat define on crease area
and outer corner to desired level of
depth and blend sure that the finished
angle is turned upward and outer and
outward to create a lifting effect which
the tape really helps with that so so if
you didn't have the tape you have to
really focus on making sure it's angled
or you could go back in and clean it up
but if you have the tape it's already
angled and you're okay you just want to
place the product like she said use a
define on a crease area in an outer
corner to desire level of depth and
blend so that's all you really gotta
worry about is putting the product where
she says and just blending it out so I'm
going to take
do I even have a car anymore as I got
rid of all my brushes okay yes short
 we'll use a short shader brush this
is the define one right here we're just
going to take that tap off the excess
and we're going to put this right here
and the outer part and really put this
into the crease now with a smaller brush
like this you're going to have a more
precise
here comes the rain cool what's
reporting hold on
I left my charcoal outside well I'm
sorry you can hear the rain it's like
raining cats and dogs right now we're
just going to really deepen this up
focus quite a bit of it
and since we're doing more of like a
really smoky look I am going to add a
little bit of black in here just to
really deepen it up and define it a
little bit more I'm out of breath I ran
down there to go get my charcoal out of
the rain because I bought a grill
yesterday was I know my girls out there
needs a cover but I'm not going out on
that no ma'am well today what you think
days what you think about the rain ok so
the main focus when you're doing this
look is just keeping the inner corner
really bright and light and just really
dipping it out towards the outer part so
now I'm going to take a little bit of
this black in the cool quad and I'm just
going to tap off the excess and then
again just put this really in the outer
V you don't want to bring it in too far
just keep like most of the smokiness on
the outer corners don't worry we're
going to blend and it's gonna be
probably like why is your not blending
we're gonna blend so kinda looks a
little funky but now it's time to blend
so I'm going to take that same exact
brush we used earlier and then this
shade right here and we're going to
blend first in the crease
we're going to drag any excess on the
lid and blend it out right there a touch
more here the part now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to touch up the
highlight one more time with that same
highlight shade we used earlier and the
brow bone
just like that okay now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to apply lashes first
want to show you guys okay so you see
how like messy it looks right here you
peel this back very gently and well BAM
you have a nice sharper line and it just
looks it's so much easier to do and it's
put together and you see all the excess
eye shadow that was on it so it's just
an easy way to create a nice sharp line
so just food for thought is I'm going to
apply some lashes I think today I'm
going to go with these Coco
Misha lashes if not I don't know yet we
will see so I'll let you guys know which
ones I go with and I'm going to do the
rest of my face makeup since this was a
first impression on the palette I'm just
going to go ahead and do my face makeup
and list down below what I use if you
guys are interested um and I'll be right
back okay so I just finished up the rest
of my face makeup and I'm used to cook
Oh lashes and goddess instead of the
other two Mama's confused and then I
also use different products for my face
I'll leave them all listed in the
description box below if you're
interested and for my lower lash line
all I did is I took a bunch of this
color from the neutral shade and pressed
it up against my lower lash line with a
little brush like this and then to blend
it out I took a pencil brush and took
this shade from the neutral palette and
just blended it out then I put some
mascara on the bottom lash line which I
have some mascara my lash line now um
and I just blended it out and my lip
color is like a combination of a bunch
of different stuff so I'll leave that
down below as well once you kind of give
it a roundup I do really love this
palette I did use this for my face and I
want to show you they're really similar
so this is the contour palette this is
the eye palette and as you can see I
have put my contour palette to use I
love this thing so I really really love
this I love the way that this look
turned out especially going by the
little pamphlet it's really helpful so

amazing and I just love that they're all
matte I just think it's awesome so
