you a first impression and it has been
so long since I've done a first
impression video why too long um I was
actually looking at old videos last
night of like old first impressions I
used to do and um old like reviews and -
the cringing that I did most of the time
I realized how much I miss doing them
and how informative they were so I
wanted to start some of those back up on
my channel I can't promise that it's
going to be something that's regular but
I'm definitely try to do a couple a
month for you guys just let me know in
the comments you know what you want to
see next and things like that I have
this foundation I'm doing today and then
I also have another one by dermablend
that I want to do a first impression on
this is the dermablend smooth liquid
camo I want to do one on this one as
well but I figured we'd start with this
one because I've had it for forever and
I have not used it I haven't even
touched it I don't know if this came in
a box or what but I just haven't touched
it this is the Laura Mercier silk creme
foundation and this is in the color
hazelnut beige which is the darkest
shade in the line they do have one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
they have ten shades which I feel like
is not really a good range it doesn't
have a lot of darker shades in here I
don't know if you guys can see but
that's the darkest right there that the
little boxes around so not that great of
a color selection for everybody
basically it says it's a original
long-wearing foundation that gives skin
a professional full coverage finish the
advanced light reflecting ingredients
work to make the appearance of fine
lines and imperfections disappear even
the hardest to hide pigmentations are
covered to look at much smoother and
more even providing full coverage that
lasts up to 12 hours this foundation is
ideal for special events or photography
it also says that it's dermatologist
tested and non-comedogenic
non-comedogenic I think I said that
right who knows it's free of oil and
fragrance is perfect for all skin types
and as most of you know I do have very
very very oily skin if you're new to my
channel I hope you like my I hope you
like my clips securing my channel I have
a very oily skin and it also have
rosacea so if you're wondering what all
the redness is it is
my rosacea and shout out to all my girls
with skin problems because that's what
makes these reviews more fun because you
see how it really works so I am going to
apply a primer because it always apply a
primer when using foundation I'm just
using this Smashbox pore minimizing one
which is been my favorite lately I think
I need to buy a new one kind of go into
Sephora today so I think I need to buy
another one but I'm just going to apply
this per usual and I don't know how this
color is going to look on me I haven't
really like I said tested it out and I
believe I ordered it online um and when
it came I just kind of threw it in my
drawer and I was like well I'll try it
one day yeah well today's the day as you
can see my face is lighter than my neck
because I do not self tan my face so yes
let's just go ahead and get started with
this bad boy like I said it is in the
color hazelnut beige so it is in a
squeeze tube like this and you get six
months out of it ooh I want how long
I've had this if you get one point eight
fluid ounces and it is kind of a thicker
foundation as you can see like it's not
runny whatsoever
don't mind this it's a lipstick I'm
going to just start applying this to my
face it's kind of crazy because one
since I have oily skin I usually stay
away from things that say luminous but
it says it's great for all skin types so
we'll see an effort so me can worry
about this foundation is annoying and
funny so we're just going to apply this
with a Beauty Blender
it's really covering up my redness
pretty well and it's pretty easy to
blend out don't take long at all Jackson
is down and neck color is okay for what
my color is now I can work with it it's
kind of hard covering the redness on my
nose sometimes it's so stinkin red
pretty light to me the darkest
foundation in the line in my opinion
like it's to me this is pretty dang
light which sucks for if you have darker
skin tones like if I were to get tanner
than this like in the summertime or
something it's not going to be that dark
and I won't be able to use it so that's
kind of a waste especially since you can
only use it for six months that kind of
sucks but it has really really good
coverage and it feels nice and light on
the skin like it doesn't feel heavy at
all feels really good
the coverage is really nice it does have
a sheen to it but saying that with
powder would probably help with that I
definitely think I'm gonna have to set
this with power just because I do have
super oily skin and with things as they
luminous I always set it with powder but
so far I really like the coverage and I
like the way that it feels on my skin
they looks really good it's not sinking
into my pores or anything like that I
think it makes my skin look nice and
healthy so so far so good I'm going to
go ahead and finish the rest of my face
makeup and then I'll be back to update
you guys on how I like it when it's all
set
hey guys so I'm back after finishing my
makeup and I'm not liking this
foundation um it just looks so
foundation e to me and I really don't
like it right now like I kind of don't
want to go out with this foundation on
um it just looks very just looks very oh
I don't know there's something about it
I mean it's like there's a shine to it
but I don't want to put more powder on
because I don't want to look cakey
because like I've already put some
powder on I don't want to add more but
it's just not looking good on my skin it
looks very I don't know like there's
it's too much and I didn't even apply
that much
not digging this foundation at all I've
heard so many people say they love this
foundation but I don't know I'm always
that one person that everybody can say
they love something and then I tried
them like I guess I'm going to go
throughout the day with this on
hopefully I don't look too crazy out in
public and I felt look don't look at my
foundation I'm just trying this out it
looks a little too much here in the
middle my eyebrows and right here around
my pores it's just looking a little too
loose like oh my god it looks really bad
I think it feels good on the skin but
it's just not looking good when I was
applying my blush and bronzer it got a
little blotchy as well and I had to take
it off and reapply this side it is 157
right now as you can see and I'm gonna
kind of go through my day and just see
how this goes on I'm so stinkin nervous
let's hope this doesn't turn out too bad
hey guys so I'm back from my day it is
now 8 to 21 so it's been quite a few
hours this is just so cute look at her
I've been doing a lot of running around
I went to Sephora which you guys are
going to see this haul really soon but
this is going to be my final update for
the day because I really just want to
take this foundation off like it's just
not working for me um so I don't know if
you guys can really see it's very oily
very blotchy and like I know you can see
this oil on my face like I have blotted
and powdered so many times today and
when I would just áfourá
the guy complemented my makeup and I was
like wait what see your cultivated
memory to go um that I had just bought
it - I think I have such oily skin this
just isn't going to work for me I know
it says it's for all skin types but I I
personally don't like it for my really
oily skin I think if you have combo to
dry skin you might love it but for me I
just oh it's just not working for me
like do you see how I'm like super you
zoom in so you can see how I'm super
oily you could see my pores are pretty
visible the oil is so bad around my nose
like this foundation does not complement
my skin at all it makes it
rough and caked up and it wears off
really bad with my skin so this is no
close and personal but this is how we're
going to do it today because we're just
showing you the truth here um but like I
mean when I blotted and stuff it looked
a little better but it was like within
the next 30 minutes I was getting oily
again just not a big fan of this
foundation I think if anybody dry skin
will love it but for me it just it
didn't cut it I mean you can see on my
face why I don't like it I'm so sad to
that this first impression didn't uh
work out the way I wanted to but while I
was this before I might as well just go
ahead and show you this I was thinking
about this foundation and I was okay I
don't like it then I did it duh so I
ended up getting the smooth finish
flawless fluid and it's oil free and it
says it's going to give a natural matte
finish so if you guys want to see a
first impression on this one then let me
know it's where I picked up today I
don't know if the color is gonna be
great or not but we're just we're gonna
wing it
thank you guys so much for watching come
out for the Sephora I'll come in for you
very soon I love you thank you so much
for watching again I don't know how many
times I can say it and I will see you
all in my next video bye
