a first impression on the lorac pro
number 2 palettes and I have been so
excited to bust this baby open but I
didn't know if I wanted to do a first
impression if I wanted to do like a
tutorial so I figured why not just match
them all together and do a first
impression with like a mini eyeshadow
tutorial involved in it so excited
they're like a mini tutorial just to
kind of let you guys see how the colors
come off on my eyes of course I do use
primers primers are very important in
general so I will be using primers in
this video but if you guys are wondering
I will have a swatches at the end of the
video with each colors on my arms so you
guys can check them out but I figured we
would go ahead and just see if the
Laurel - is it awesome as the Lark one
more warm tone and this one is
definitely more cool so I'm just going
to show you guys the colors in each
palette and we're gonna see if the
formula of this palette which we know is
awesome it has great pigmentation and
super creamy we're gonna see if the
lorac pro 2 can compare to the first one
so that's what we'll be talking about
today I know you guys missed a first
impressions video so I figured I would
go ahead and do one for you today so
yeah and by the way if you guys are
wondering a what I'm wearing this
amazing statement necklace is from
Bubble bar and I'm obsessed with this I
saw this not too long ago on a couple
different girls and I was like need in
my life so when it went on bauble bar I
was looking for this necklace and I
noticed a bunch of different things that
I really liked and I noticed that they
culminate to a bunch of different people
like my style it's kind of like not so
preppy but it's like a little bit girly
bit more I would much rather wear combat
boots and things like that but they have
stuff to accommodate like me and a girl
who is super girly and then they have
like dainty pieces as well so I really
love all the bar they have amazing
pieces so I would definitely check them
out and if you guys are interested
necklace or just some of the things on
the site you can go to the link bar comm
slash KC and use the coupon code KC for

much to bubble bar for providing that
coupon code for my subscribers I know
you guys will love the site and also my
hair and the extensions I'm wearing they
will be listed in the description box
below as well so let's just go ahead and
get started with the first impression as
you can see I still have it and it's
pretty little box and it looks just like
the packaging that the original lorac
Pro palette came in and I know a lot of
us know what the original law Pro looks
like but I just going to quickly show
you this is what it looks like it's just
black packaging kind of like that matte
texture like NARS and then you have a
nice mirror and then all these shades
you can see I hit pan on a couple of
them and this is such a gorgeous palette
I absolutely love the original lorac Pro
palette
I just need it's amazing and you can
just use this palette and be good to go
I've always recommended the lorac pro
original palette over like the Naked
palette or any other palette I just feel
like this is so convenient so yeah
that's what the original one looks like
and we're just gonna go ahead and open
this baby up
alright now you do get another eyeshadow
primer which is nice with these palaces
at the lorac behind the scenes eye
primer and I've never tried it before
but they do come with a nice deluxe
sized sample so this should last you
quite a while so as you can see this one
is like a grey color whereas the
original one is black I love how sleek
and pretty they are these would be
amazing for traveling just because
they're so slim this is what it looks
like you get a little sleeve right here
and then these are your colors so these
are the colors you get they are
absolutely beautiful
again you get another top row that is
all matte and then a bottom row that is
shimmer and these are more cool toned
eyeshadows and they look freakin
phenomenal I am going to do like
close-up swatches of these for you guys
then let me I'm going to go ahead and
touch one so this is light brown yes
love it Rose Oh Rose is so gorgeous I
love the fact that both of them come
with a matte black I think that is so
convenient so here a couple of them
swatch right here so pretty
look at MOCA logos on my pinky oh my god
it's so gorgeous I'm ready to play I
really like the layout of both of these
palettes just the fact that you have
mats on tops and shimmers on bottom
depending on if you like a warm or cool
or eyeshadows more that would kind of
depend on which one you would want to
get the original Ark is definitely more
warm whereas the lorac 2 is definitely a
little bit more cool okay so now I'm
going to go ahead and bring you guys in
and we can start playing with this eye
shadow palette and I will do like a
little mini tutorial for you guys I'm
not gonna do a full face I just want to
play with the eyes and see how the
colors apply if they apply as well as
the original or Polk palette so yeah
let's go ahead and get into the
excellent tutorial so the first shade we
are going to take is this light brown
right here it's just a nice cool toned
medium brown color and this color we're
actually going to place in the crease so
this will be our transition shade so
whatever
shadows we put like on our lid if we
decide to go a little bit darker
they will blend up to the brow bone I
don't really work with cool toned
eyeshadows very much but this palette is
just so beautiful that I can't I can't
stay away so I'm going to take rose this
is on the shimmer part of the palette a
little bit of fallout but that's ok I'm
gonna apply this all over the lid super
pigmented that is so friggin beautiful
this is such a creamy eyeshadow like I
feel like it's hard to find shadows like
this that are super creamy and just
apply beautifully the way it feels to
like on the brush and like applying it
to my eye it's just very very smooth
it's not gritty or anything like that
which I really appreciate and then what
I'm gonna do is I want to play with this
Jade color so bad so I'm gonna take it
Jade right here was just that mossy
green shade and I'm going to put this
more in the outer half of the lid so I'm
going to take that same brush so tap off
the excess and just apply it right out
here I'm gonna start out with the outer
V first and just kind of bring it almost
halfway onto the lid
there a really cool tone silver and here
it's is really pretty too I don't really
like so
but he's really pretty I want to say my
Mac 217 I'm just going to blend out that
Jade color
fairly easy to blend I'm gonna dip my
brush into light brown just to touch to
help blend out the edge of this Jade
shade
Jane shade but blends really nicely
think I want to take I kind of wish that
was like a deep matte Brown in here
because I would put that in the outer V
and really smoke it out but I guess what
I'll do is I'll just go I'm going in
with the black so I'm gonna take the
black from the palette right here and I
will just put this in a very outer V not
going in too far because I won't and
want you to still see the green so I'm
just going to apply this right here I
love the blacks in these palettes
because they're super pigmented and
Gorge take that same Mac brush and just
blend it you don't want to blend it as
far as you did the mossy green but you
just want to blend it right there and
that outer half just so it's nice and
smooth I'm gonna take cocoa in the
palette right here on the end with a
blending brush and I'm just going to tap
it in there and then I'm just going to
lightly place this in the crease very
lightly just to really smoke out this
look so you see that I barely touched my
eye and I barely had any product on that
brush so you can't have a gradient from
the rose to the green back to the black
and then a little bit of brown in the
crease just to kind of pull it all
together very gorgeous eyeshadows blend
beautifully blending is a huge thing for
me if I have shadows that don't blend
really well then I go absolutely insane
but what I'm gonna do is do the rest of
my face makeup and then we'll be good
for the tutorial so now that I finished
the rest of my face makeup if you guys
want to know what I'm wearing on my face
I will leave everything I used it down
below in the description box but we're
going to go ahead and move on to the
lower lash line I'm gonna use any color
rose that we use on the inner
my earlier I'm just going to put this on
the inner part of our lower lash line so
like right here around the tear duct
area so you can see how to put that in
right there so now we're gonna go in
with that Jade color and place this on
the rest of the lower lash line this
right here in the close-up I want to
show you guys I did highlight my brow
bone
I used the colors to know in the palette
which is just a nice shimmery white
shade so this is a very white shade has
a lot of shimmer in it and you can
really tell but it kind of has like a
metallic feel okay so now that I've done
it with the demo makeup look that I just
did I want to tell you guys really
quickly what I think about the palette
my final thoughts on this palette is a
thing it's amazing I think it's
basically the same thing formula wise as
the lorac pro original palette which is
great because sometimes when people
relaunch things in different colors it
kind of can be different and not as
great as the first one so I'm really
happy with the formula at the colors and
everything of this palette I think it's
so beautiful especially this green shade
this Jade color is absolutely stunning I
think it's really hard to find like a
really gorgeous green that blends really
well and looks too great on different
eye colors so I love this one I love the
shimmer in it I love the fact that they
stayed with the whole trend of mattes on
tops and shimmer on bottom and I just
really love these colors so if you're in
the market for another palette or if
you're just interested in this one I
definitely say give it a go it's
basically the same formula as long as
you love the colors the only thing I
don't have to say about this palette
that's negative is that there is quite a
bit of fallout but I mean the colors are
so creamy and buttery just make sure you
tap off your brush and then put it on
your eye and you'll be good to go it
won't be too crazy and all over your
face I love this palette I go ahead and
give it a thumbs up definitely recommend
you guys checking it out and if you guys
are interested this is available in Ulta
okay guys so that is it for this video I
really hope you enjoyed it again I will
be leaving everything that I wore and

20% off as long as you use the coupon
