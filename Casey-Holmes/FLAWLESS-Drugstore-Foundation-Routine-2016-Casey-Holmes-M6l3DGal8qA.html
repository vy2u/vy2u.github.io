sharing with you my drugstore foundation
routine and I really love the foundation
I'm going to share with you guys and I
love all the products that I show in
this video so they're all pretty much
new for the most part
- the concealer that I'm trying out it's
still drugstore but I'm still trying it
out it's just not brand new but
everything else is pretty new in this
video how do you requested this video
after I told you there was a foundation
I've been loving and I mentioned it in
my haul it is the Maybelline Dream
velvet soft matte hydrating foundation I
really love this I have very oily skin
and I love it it doesn't feel heavy
it looks so smooth on your skin and it
blends so well and when I get started
with the video more I'll tell you guys
more about it but this is a foundation
I've been loving and I think it's
awesome so yeah I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching it don't forget to give it a
thumbs up if you do like this video and
love drugstore products and don't forget
to subscribe to my channel so you don't
miss out on any videos and also before I
go leave a comment down below letting me
know what video you want to see next or
like what your favorite drugstore punch
is at the moment because I am just
trying a whole bunch of things and I
want to do more reviews and things like
that you want to see how I got this
drugstore foundation routine then let's
just get started okay so the first thing
I'm going in with is this covergirl
trublend face primer for oily skin I
really like it because it does keep me
matte but it also makes my skin and
really really smooth and I just it's a
really good primer I definitely
recommend checking it out then I'm gonna
take the foundation I'm in the shade
shade 75 natural beige and some people
like to apply this with a Beauty Blender
some with a brush I personally love to
apply it with this make a peak face
buffer brush I'll leave a link for down
below if you're interested but it's been
one of my favorite face brushes in a
while but this foundation is so great it
just glides over your skin beautifully
it is buildable and I have larger pores
around my nose area and honestly you
can't even tell I have pores it just
smooths over your fine lines your pores
any problem areas that you have in since
it is buildable it does cover my rosacea
really well and it lasts all day long I
really really love it it just it's
Oh beautiful on the skin
and then I'm going to go ahead and move
on to concealer I couldn't decide
between the wet and wild one or the
Maybelline but I ended up going with the
Maybelline one because I've already know
I love the wet wild concealer that came
out but I wanted to still kind of use
the Maybelline one and test it out
because I'm going to keep you guys
updated on how I love it so I'm going to
put it underneath my eyes and in the
center of my face and then I'm just
going to blend it out with that same
makeup brush
then I'm going in with the wet-and-wild
contouring palette and caramel toffee
and I'm going to take the yellow tone
shade and set all of my concealer with
this this is a really great palette it's
very similar to the Marc Jacobs Mirage
palette and I think it's a great product
to go ahead and purchase because the
bronzer is pretty dark but if you use a
light hand with it it'll be okay you use
a fluffy brush or more dense brush
depending on how much color you want but
I'm going to go ahead and take a little
bit of a fluffy brush and put this on
the top of my forehead just to bronze up
right there and contour a little bit and
then I'm also going to take a Sonia
Kashuk contouring brush which I highly
recommend
I found mine at Target but this
contouring brush from her is amazing
it's dense but it's not too dense and
the bristles blend everything out so
beautifully and the brush is just so
stinkin cute so if you're looking for a
NARS in a dupe I would definitely check
out this one from Sonia Kashuk
and then I'm kind of going in a reverse
order here and taking me Maybelline at
fix what is this called the fix setting
powder the loose powder and I'm going to
set my face with this I'm just using it
it cosmetics brush but I love this
powder I meant to do it before I contour
it but I forgot this just keeps me matte
and it just looks so flawless as well
then I'm taking the Maybelline master
contour palette I'm using the blush I'm
going to go ahead and apply that I just
realized how many Maybelline products
I'm showing and no I'm not sponsored by
them I've purchased all these myself and
then I'm just going to go ahead and
blend this out and then I'm also going
to use the highlight shade in the
palette and put that on my skin as well
I really do like the highlight shade I
like it more with my finger than I do
with a brush if I'm going to use it with
a brush
I like the brush to be more dense but it
gives a really pretty glow to the skin I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you all in my next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
