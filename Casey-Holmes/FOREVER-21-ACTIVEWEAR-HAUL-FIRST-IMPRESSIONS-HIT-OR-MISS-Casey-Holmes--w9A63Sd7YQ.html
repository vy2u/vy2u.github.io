doing a different kind of video that I'm
so excited to film because I have been
wanting to try out forever21 activewear
for a while now and I just went on the
side a few weeks ago like before I even
left for Fiji and purchased so many
things to test out for you guys I wanted
to get this up while I was in Fiji but I
didn't have time to film it before we
left so now is the time I'm very excited
we have so much stuff to go through so
much that actually took them all out of
the plastic wrap and just decide to set
them to the side so that I could go
through them quickly hopefully but let
me know if you guys like this video idea
if you want me to continue to do more
and then definitely give it a thumbs up
so it's kind of just like a first
impressions activewear
kind of clothing which I'm very excited
about because I love active where I live
in active where I forgot to subscribe
before you leave and let's just go ahead
and try on some affordable activewear
testing one two three testing
you look beautiful test shot okay so
this is the first outfit it's just a
little burgundy outfit that I thought
was really cute is the high-waisted wine
all of the pants that I got are high
waisted and in for reference if you wear
Lululemon I wear a size six and Lulu's
so um I got these in a medium i think
this detail right here the like open
mesh detail is super cute you see
there's water
they love to eat spot fruit which is
great and I actually really like this
shirt yeah I really like this outfit I
think it's cute I could have gone down a
size in these leggings I feel like to a
small just because I have a lot of room
and the crotch area and it's just a
little just a little big also I'm
wearing this sports bra and this color
so it's really sexy it has like a nice
deep V so that's what it looks like
right there this was only 1290 I'm
wearing it now I got all of my sports
bras in a size medium which I'm a little
concerned about because this one has a
lot of underboob like it's not fitting
all of my chests in there it's pretty
tight but it doesn't cover me all the
way so I probably won't be keeping this
one just because I'll never really wear
it I'll probably honestly fall out if I
was running or something hey so and this
is the next outfit and I was a little
nervous about these pants but they
actually look really cute and they hit
in a really nice area now I take it
these in a medium as well I could have
definitely gone with a small I feel like
I have a lot of room in the waist that
I'm him to be a little bit tighter so if
I'm writing or something I don't have to
constantly pull them up but the pattern
is so cute I wasn't sure how I would
feel about it but I really really like
it he's so adorable I also got the
matching a sports bra which is right
there
such a cute combo I'm not the type to
wear a sports bra in leggings to the gym
I'm just not there yet but the sports
bra for this one is so nice your 36d
it's gonna think you just fine it's
gonna hold everything in and it's tight
enough to where if you ran it's still
gonna support you but I wouldn't do a
super-intense party oh you don't have
sang because in my heard a little bit
whenever I do cardio I wear a size small
and sports bras to really push up
against my chest and that way they
literally don't move this is holding
them pretty tightly which I like and
then this shirt I think is cute it's
just like a little simple basic top I
like to tie talks like this a lot of the
time like it
little not just to add some shape
doesn't really have much shape at all
it's kind of boxy but if you're like me
and don't really care and just want to
throw something cute on this is the way
to go I worry more about like leggings
and how they look then you do my job and
I need to see if they're squad and I
think they are squat proof but in like
this one area where there's a patch of
gray you can see a little bit of skin
but it's not like full-blown but
vagina okay you know if you've been
doing squats and you have the wrong pair
of leggings on it's a show and it's
embarrassing so it's always important to
make sure your squat proof and I'm
really surprised that the first two that
I've tried are because they were so
affordable okay so this is the next
little outfit I love the cutout like a
mesh detail here I think it's so sexy
these I got in a size small and these
are definitely the right size for me and
these are high-waisted which I love I
love high waisted leggings denim
everything and yeah I just feel like
they look so cute they kind of flattened
the booty out a little bit but I'm okay
with it and they really hit right there
on the tops of my hip bones so it feels
like they're gonna stay there pretty
well and these leggings were 1990 not
bad at all
this top is the same top as that
burgundy top I love this one the mesh
detail this is just a great like staple
basic top this is good next up we have
these leggings right here I really it
like the fabric of this and I like how
the band fits as well there's not like a
super hard thread or whatever goes
through the top of some highways
leggings that like really pulls in tight
it just kind of feels very comfortable
kind of like loungewear and it's
actually really flattering here at the
top because it doesn't like cut off and
you tell me fad or anything like that
the only thing about these is that these
will give you a camel toe okay
we'll give you hella cameltoe so just be
warned um I think I'm gonna return them
just for that reason but otherwise
they're really really cute yeah these
are definitely squat proof so I like
them but they give camel toe
and I just can't work with it next up we
have these leggings these are think are
probably the most high waisted ones that
I bought and I didn't know they were
this high waisted like this is way above
my belly button this is just like super
super high the kind of thing you can
wear with a sports bra and you would be
fine I don't know if I wear these to the
gym though just because of this little
detail right here it's like super super
sexy just me though
I probably wouldn't wear them but they
are really cute I just feel like there's
a lot of fabric here in the crotch area
I don't know why that is like look at
how long it is it's just so much so I am
going to return these just because I'm
not a fan of all that fabric but I do
think they're cute maybe if you had like
a longer torso or something you could
get away with wearing these yeah not my
favorite I have a feeling these arms
squat proof yeah that squat proof that
was like full-on booty okay full-on
booty so would not recommend these for
the gym probably you just wear them
around the house or something but don't
spoil them because it shows everything
okay so since these are so high-waisted
I figured I would show you guys that
this sports bra and this one's really
cute it actually feels really
comfortable as well has like a nice
little back detail I like this a lot it
is definitely not a high impact sports
bra it's definitely more of like low
impact like yoga or if you wanted to do
arms one day and not a lot of cardio I
would definitely go for this one yeah
I'm definitely gonna keep this I also
really like these leggings as well these
are again super high waisted and then
think it would be this high waisted but
I do really like it
they're adorable equal like a little
crop top with this yeah we'll say is I
thought the ends of these were white and
they're definitely like a light pink so
I don't know if that bothers you or not
but they are also gonna go ahead and
throw on this little top that has mesh
details all on the sleeve it's just a
little white basic top so this is the
top I remember seeing a review on this
one saying it was super boxy and it is
but it also has like these cut details
right here so you could easily like knot
it in the front or something with how
high-waisted these leggings are I mean
it looks completely fine with this I
don't know what y'all but especially on
leg days I like to see at least from
here down when I'm working out that's
why I like to tie a lot of tops up
because I like to see all the muscles
working I don't know I get a lot of
satisfaction out of that I actually
really like the top and I think it's
adorable so let's see if these are squat
proof and they are well no they're not
no they're not these are not squat proof
you can definitely see my booty through
them so again not something you would
want for leg days but you could use it
for any other like training days these
definitely aren't a see-through as those
all-black ones that I showed you guys
like the see-through going all the way
up to your hip bones but they are still
a little bit see-through in something I
wouldn't recommend squatting in hey guys
this is the next outfit I love this one
mainly because I love the green leggings
and this top is super cool as well I
wonder how these are gonna react I guess
you wouldn't dry these in the dryer
because I feel like these letters with
you all messed up
they're like this cool shiny material if
you can see and it says bad habits I
know I really think this is adorable I
love the color combo I love the length
of this top it also has the cutouts on
the side which is really nice and these
leggings again I do love but I
definitely need a size small because
they are pretty big on me
and you can always tie this up in the
front since you have that cut detail and
this will also cover your bus so if you
have any but sweat that happens this
covers it so I like this a lot of the
leggings definitely need them in a size
small let's see if their squat proof yep
definitely squat proof so highly
recommend these I feel like these would
show a lot of sweat though so just be
warned these leggings I was really
excited to get just cuz I thought they
were super cute and something I would
definitely wear it to the gym they have
that little mesh detail right here but
they don't go all the way up I love this
color as well I love like grey leggings
I think they're so fun and this has that
really nice high waisted band again
where it just lays perfectly on top and
it actually sits right there above your
hip bones which I love just like it's
just sits there it's perfect yep
definitely other so these are are a
keeper I would definitely wear these on
leg day I just think they're so cute
these are the last pair of like all
black leggings I purchased because I
have a lot of black leggings from
Lululemon so I don't want to buy too
many but I love these are my favorite
that I've tried on for the all-black
have this little detail here on your
calves nothing too extra it just adds a
little something to it these are pretty
high waisted they go a little bit above
my belly button which I love those are
my favorite I did get these on a small
and I just realized that I did mention a
few other sizes so I should have all the
sizes listed in this video as well as
the prices so if I missed it they should
pop up on the screen for you they're
definitely a little bit see-through not
as much as the other one but not enough
to where I wouldn't wear them like I
would wear these for any other day but
leg day because I think they fit really
well and they just feel really snug so I
like these I'm gonna keep them okay so
these leggings I am definitely surprised
by they're a different material than I
thought they would be but they feel so
good I thought they were gonna be like
how do you say
kind of like Spanx in a way and or not
they kind of feel like the gray ones
where they just feel I don't really feel
comfortable they'd a lot more high-rise
than i expected they are above my belly
button which I love I also love the
detail of these they're so cute I do
have these in a medium I could
definitely go down to a small because it
is a little bit big but I like them I
like this little run detail right here I
think all of the shadows and stuff are
really flattering oh yeah
up nope you can see your booty so these
are again a little bit seafood it might
just keep them and then wear them with a
longer shirt like this so that way you
can't see my but you know they're the
same as those black ones that I showed
you that were like the see-through up to
your like hip bones they're super
high-waisted I actually like these more
than the black ones just because they
don't look so scandalous like I guess
because they're this great color you
can't really tell like I have a lot of
skin here so I do really like them I
love the color there's also a little bit
of see-through mesh right here which i
think is so cute or I guess like you
call netted these are super high rise
they go well above my belly button and I
actually really like these I like the
tied top with it as well because I just
I think all of this gray black and white
kind of mixed in is just super
flattering so I love it I got these on
the size small they fit perfectly and
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say
these aren't block cruise but we'll just
do it we'll try it for the tube oh oh
these are not bad I actually don't see
like anything and all these are good to
go
so I like them a lot these are
definitely a must-have I'm gonna be
keeping these I think they're so cute
way better than the black one so if you
don't want to show your goodies but you
still want that kind of sexy open part
right here I would definitely go for
these okay so this last pair of leggings
I'll be trying on and these are super
cute they have like these cutout
details right here which I really like
again they're high-waisted very cute
leggings I got another medium again I
need a small they are a little too big
they won't like sit next to me really
tight but I really like that I'm gonna
reorder these in a different size just
because I love this little cutout that
perfect little size for capris I love
them I guess I just have a thing for
gray leggings I think I do
um but yeah so I like these a lot let's
test out the squat ability oh yeah these
are fine these are good so these are
definitely not see-through these would
be squat proof definitely need a search
size of these because I think they're so
cute
okay guys so that is it for this triumph
clothing haul from forever 21 overall
I'm pretty impressed by the quality I
did not have that high of hopes but I
feel like there's a lot of cute items a
lot of cute top leggings of course with
the leggings it's just gonna be you know
trying them on doing squat tests and
making sure you're not showing any
goodies when you're working out all in
all I think it was about half and half
