concealers always getting a little crazy
but maybe once we declutter
we'll be a little bit better yeah I got
eyeliners mascaras in here these are
like just extra NARS foundation let's
start with foundations foundations um is
one of my favorite things about makeup I
love a full coverage foundation and yeah
I feel like I've had something solid
Asians for forever honestly I've had
them for so long now it's good for me to
go ahead and get rid of them because
they're probably bad by now cuz makeup
does go bad they're probably bad right
now is they probably need to get rid of
them and just purchase new ones that way
I don't break out this is the drugs
the most current been so let's see what
we got this is the flower beauty light
illusion foundation I have two of these
I think I'm just gonna keep one shade
looking at them this looks more like
giving my shades I'm going to keep this
one donate this one so you know I'm not
three anyway anything away unless it's
expired
we have some covergirl foundations I
love this foundation classic ivory
creamy natural these aren't my shades I
think I've sent these in PR so I'm going
to donate these and get my correct shade
provo foundation mixer this is one that
makes it a little bit more warm I've had
this for forever and I feel like I just
need to go ahead and get rid of it
I've been using my Catrice one anyway is
much more and I just also gonna get rid
of these derma Col foundations I never
ever use these I just use them for
videos so time to donate those I am
going to keep this foundation because
I'm still trying it out I got it when I
was in Canada same with this Catrice one
I just thought it's not too long ago so
I'm I keep using that this LA Colors
truly matte not the biggest fan of I'm
actually gonna go ahead and donate these
because I just don't ever use them I
just don't think they're the best so I
think I have another one here yes I'm
just gonna donate these I love the
better skin what shade is this soft
honey I'm gonna keep this shade
this one's an ivory that will probably
never match me so I'm gonna go ahead and
donate that I'm going to keep all of my
pro matte foundations you guys know
obsessed with these and then I'm also
going to go ahead and keep I'm gonna
keep natural beige this is the one I've
used the most anyway so we'll just keep
that moving on to the Maybelline fit me
I have two colors this one definitely
looks a little bit too red so I'm gonna
keep this shade right here which is soft
tan donate this one I haven't decided
what to do with this yet so I'm just a
satin matte foundations um I've had
these for forever I honestly feel like
they're expired by now so I'm gonna go
ahead and get rid of these and just try
to purchase new ones if they have them
unless they don't have them I'll cut my
losses but I'm pretty sure these are bad
by now and then for so long these are
amazing foundations of they come back
out these definitely get them I say that
goes for these bad boys
I love the soap and glory one heck of a
blot foundations I'm gonna keep this one
since I haven't used it yet but these
that I have used I know are incredibly
old like years old so I'm just gonna go
ahead and toss that and this foundation
is still around so you can definitely
get your hands on it
another dream matte mousse foundation I
know I've had this one for forever I'm
actually going to keep this one this is
the one I believe I use the most in the
shade medium 2.5 so I'm gonna get rid of
medium 0 right here I'm gonna keep the
Burt's Bees goodness glow foundation as
well as this Revlon insta filter cuz I
still kind of like want to try this out
and I got it not too long ago and of
course keeping the Maybelline better
skin we have this Catrice on that plus
I'm pretty sure I didn't like this
foundation I'm pretty dang sure I didn't
if I did
oopsies so before I toss it I'll look it
up but I never use this foundation this
high-end foundation drawer is about to
be crazy this has the most so we have
the double we're one in two don't know
why this is I don't know this color so
I'm kind of interested to see it looks
very light that is definitely not my
shade which is probably why I've never
used it so I'm gonna go ahead and donate
this it cosmetics bye bye foundation I'm
actually still trying these I have
neutral medium and then neutral tan so
this was just a little bit lighter than
this I'm going to keep these cuz I'm
still testing them out we also have
these peach out we also have the peach
perfect foundations from Too Faced I
love this foundation I think it's
amazing have four shades light beige
neutral base warm beige sand I could
definitely tell I used sand a lot so I'm
gonna keep sand also warm Bay and then
I'll keep light beige so I'm keepin
light beige warm beige and use and and I
can definitely mix in those colors and I
will donate natural beige because have I
use this one no I haven't uses
all right if we got our glass stick
foundations obsessed with our glass
stick foundations I love these I'm
definitely gonna keep both of them also
have the Smashbox camera ready BB cream
this one's in light/medium this is
pretty good but honestly I never really
used beauty creams so I'm gonna go ahead
and toss that now we have the Laura
Mercier a flawless fusion ultra long
wear foundation I did not like this on
me I felt like it was super heavy I just
wasn't a big fan of it so our Laura
Mercier I love your new concealer though
moving on to the Smashbox Studios skin
foundation don't look at how much of
that foundation I have used I do really
like this foundation I don't use it a
lot at this moment I kind of feel like
it's pretty old not even moving it's not
moving from words from so I'm actually
gonna go ahead and just toss these in
the trash I've had them for a really
long time but this is a really great
foundation if you want medium buildable
coverage heart shaped tape you guys have
been asking me all about this I think
you guys know why I haven't done a video
and I'm actually gonna keep these I'm
gonna keep these for a future video
one day whenever I feel the time is
right I don't mind this foundation I
don't think it's the absolute best but
it's not terrible but I'm going to keep
these for a future video
oh yeah a high coverage cream foundation
we have almond and latte almond I
believe is just whoa look at it look at
it moving in there you see that it's
like water what not really almond does
not make sure you all latte is more
close to my color so I'm gonna keep
latte I'm still trying to find like my
perfect shade with this g-way foundation
all right we have giorgio armani a power
of fabric foundation this is not my
favorite foundation I think it looks
okay on the skin but it's just one of
those things where it was a lot of money
and I'm trying to figure out why not my
favorite as well as the designer lift
one this one I know a lot of people
would like dry skin normal kind of combo
love this
I'm verily this makes me ollie it just
doesn't work for me so I'm actually
going to donate these two day Lauder
Double Wear we have four in one
and then 3w 120 these are my two shades
I'm gonna keep four in one but I'm gonna
toss this one cut it forever and it's
just it's just gross then we have the it
cosmetics bye bye redness I bought this
and I still have not used it I've used
it before used to one of my all-time
favorite products but I've had this for
so long I still have not used it so I
think I want to save this for a what's
that called
throw back throw down that I used to do
but just keep that Fiona Styles matte
finish foundation I'm gonna go ahead and
donate this you can't even get it
anymore no point keeping it so goodbye
and let's see bobby brown skin long wear
weightless foundation this was not full
coverage to me but i'm gonna try it out
a little bit more it wasn't my all-time
favorite but it wasn't terrible so i'll
keep you updated but it's definitely not
full coverage Kat Von D lock-it tattoo
foundation yeah this one's a little too
heavy for me
I never gravitate towards it I think
it's just too much for me believe it or
not yeah I'm gonna get rid of this one
and we have this stellar foundation I
don't even know what it's called it just
looks like this I did not like this
foundation it made my skin look horrible
it looks so similar to the hood of edy
foundation who would it is way better at
this one it just made my skin look
terrible so goodbye huda beauty just
talked about it I love it this is such a
full coverage foundation looks great on
the skin to me I'm definitely going to
continue to use this maybe get rid of
the Smashbox Studios skin Natasha Danone
up foundation eggs I used to love this
foundation can you tell by how beat-up
it is I think I'm gonna get rid of it
and then if I want to try it again down
the road I will I think it's just old
because when Davis picked this out for
the video we did which I will link in a
car just didn't perform the way I
remembered it performing you know so I
think it's old oh my gosh you guys okay
the the reason why I have so many of
this next one is because it came in PR I
don't know why I decided to keep all of
them but it is the why sell all hours
foundation I love this foundation I have
three six nine shades I know look okay I
know that's too much I did keep them
one of my shades my perfect shade I
can't remember what it was anymore I
have to look it up on my videos my
perfect shades broke and it broke in one
of my loofah Tom makeup bags I've been
super bitter about it because my loofah
Tom makeup bag is now covered in
foundation and it's been such a bitch to
try to get off I do love this foundation
though it looks beautiful such a
gorgeous foundation I'm gonna go through
these shades really quickly and try to
find ones that I think will work for me
I think that's gonna be enough yeah and
then this is B 50 B 45 again so I still
I have doubles of some so I'm just gonna
keep these three so the shades I'm
keeping this be 40 be 45 be 50 I feel
like that's perfect for me in myself tan
these six can be donated all right and
then we have this G Bashi mighty mighty
samay a velvet Wow I don't really
remember how I feel about this I haven't
used it much I'm gonna keep it in here
it must not be that good if it's in the
back I'm gonna try just a little bit
more because it was expensive before I
completely toss it bare minerals bare
Pro I'm gonna donate this because it's
not my color at all its camel 7 and it I
haven't been able to try it because it's
not my color
alright now I got these NARS foundations
I love this foundation this one's
obviously my shade can you see how much
I've use of that this is Anna Barcelona
it's like my perfect shade so I'm gonna
keep this one and then I'm also going to
keep let's see and then I'm also going
to keep this one which is Santa Fe it's
a little bit darker or I'm sorry it's a
little bit lighter then these two so I
can mix and match to make them my
perfect shade goodbye will donate you

we're gonna donate this one and this is
a new touch of primer that came out and
I'm gonna keep this because I'm still
trying it out what do I want to do with
this how long have I had this product

gonna toss this I've had it forever you
see with my absolute favorite primers
seen are smudge proof eyeshadow base
it's really really good if you got oily
eyelids you will love this have been
using the smashbox one more just because
it has a tint to it but if you like a
clear primer and you have oily eyelids
and you're just having an issue finding
one that works for you this one's
fantastic
the do your skin ever wear primer I'm
gonna get rid of this I didn't know a
difference with this at all it's like a
really sad day because that was stupid
expensive the AL Jeunesse poor corrector
I didn't notice the difference with this
either for me personally like I am more
of I'd rather have a mattifying primer
than a pore filler to be honest with you
and a lot of these poor fillers are
awful on my oily skin so I'm gonna go
ahead and just donate that one because I
never use it this is a Tarte poreless
it's also a mattifying primer I have not
tried this much I need to try more so
I'm gonna keep that as well as this
origins original skin pore perfecting
cooling priority every time I spray this

try it because it is new so we have the

treatment primer I feel like I've had
this forever so I am just gonna go ahead

I used this in the primer water which I
still really do like this but I never
use it so I'm just gonna donate that to
