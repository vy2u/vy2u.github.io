call an uber do what you gotta do boo
don't drink and drive I hope you guys
enjoy this thank you so much for
watching without further adieu let's
just go ahead and get started with the
makeup tutorial getting started we're
going to use a primer this is the NARS
eyeshadow primer it's the smudge proof
eyeshadow base I believe I love it I've
been using it for so long if you have
oily eyelids and just want a clear
primer this is the way to go because
nothing creases I promise you not even
this glitter so then I'm going to use
this japonesque palette it's an all
matte palette with neutral shades
literally perfect can go with any
different look I use the cream to set
that primer in place and then I'm using
the mid-tone Brown that I'm putting on
right now all into my crease and a
little bit up towards the brow we don't
want to go above this first shade that
we put on then we're going in with the
second darkest Brown and we're going to
put this right below that color and into
the crease and also into the outer V and
then the next step we're going to use
the darker shade and go a little bit
below the second shade that we just put
on and blend it out these first few
steps are pretty basic and easy and
honestly you could just do this put a
winged liner on red lip new lip whatever
you're feeling and you could be set for
New Year's you know what I'm saying
so just
easy step-by-step look that shouldn't be
too difficult to get now to the star of
the show I'm using this estate edit
palette I'm using this green right here
if you've been watching my videos you
know I love green eye shadows I just
think they are absolutely stunning so
I'm going to be fluffing this into the
crease and in the inner and outer corner
of my eye I'm going to leave the center
of the lid a little bit bare but don't
worry if you do get a little bit of
color there because we're going to go
over it with glitter but you just want
to build this shade up really get that
green to pop and just make sure you're
blending in circular motions so that you
don't have any harsh lines now I'm going
to take a smaller blending brush this
brush is key I love it and I'm going to
get right in that inner corner then I'm
taking the Too Faced glitter glue this
is literally glue for your glitter
that's why they call it that it's
absolutely amazing and I promise you
nothing Falls nothing creases is the
best taking this Urban Decay moon dust
shadow or glitter liner I don't know
what they call it but this isn't the
color chemtrail it's amazing you guys oh
my god it is so pigmented and it does
not burn my eyes which is amazing for me
I've tried the NYX glitters which you
can still try those but they did burn my
eyes and this is just awesome it's very
pigmented and I'm going to put that on
the center of my lid and I'm going to
blend it out with a brush just by
tapping it and really pushing it onto my
eye then this is kind of like the key to
this I'm going to take that smaller
brush again with that green and I'm
going to blend out the edges of this
chemtrail and when you do this it really
enhances some of that jewel toned green
on your eye it is just beautiful this
really makes green pop I think if you
use the si edit palette with like fix+
or something it's going to be the most
beautiful intense green ever I mean it's
beautiful without it but it just really
pops when you wet it then I'm taking
this new makeup forever starlit powder I
believe is what it's called and I don't
know if these have launched yet I did
get it in a PR package but you could use
a really light highlighter or whatever
you wanted a really light shimmery eye
shadow as well and I'm just going to put
this right on top of that glitter just
to really make it pop and give it that
wet lid look I feel like this completed
the whole eye shadow look it really
made everything pop and I also used it
as a face highlighter as well blend out
any harsh edges that you have and I'm
using these I lower lashes in Lux gilded
amazing they have these at Ulta during
the drugstore section using my regular
primers that I love I'm just going to
prime my face if you're interested I
will have everything linked down below
in the description box using my Sonia
Kashuk satin matte foundation I cannot
get away from this foundation it's so
good I just love it too full coverage
foundation I'm using my japonesque
sponge to really blend this in don't
mind my self tan hands because they're a
hot mess you see that line I have to fix
it
I know I do so I'm just going to blend
this out and I'm going in with these
concealers I'm using the Tarte shape
tape right in the inner part of my eye
to cover up some of my darkness then I'm
using the Too Faced Born This Way on the
rest of my face just to highlight since
I don't really need a lot of coverage on
the rest of my face I'm just using a
lighter concealer to lighten it up
after I blended that out I'm gonna bake
with my flower beauty powder and then I
do fill in my brows I didn't show you
guys filling in my brows because my
brows have been a mess lately I just
can't get them normal I don't like them
so I'm just gonna move on to dusting
away my baking so I'm gonna bronze now
with this nutri Trina no can I say it
Neutrogena bronzer it's amazing I love
it you're gonna see it in my yearly
favorites I mean I just can't get enough
of it you know when you find that one
true love you just can't get away next
up I'm contouring with this elf powder
right here I love this is the pressed
mineral powder in caramel cabana really
great contouring color if you want to
check out some of my drugstore favorites
I'll have two of the videos I've just
done recently linked down below so you
can check out what I love why I love
them and see some recommendations taking
this Marc Jacobs blush in lines and last
night and I'm going to put this on my
cheeks and then taking that make up
forever powder again that I use on my
eyes and I'm going to put this on my
cheeks and just highlight my face with
this
I also put that same powder underneath
my brows to highlight that as well
moving on to eyeliner I'm taking my NARS
via veneto eyeliner and I'm going to put
this on my waterline then taking the
black in this palette I'm going to put
I'm going to push this up against my
lower lash line and then blend it out
with one of the shades from the
japonesque palette
topping everything off with this mascara
from benefit roller lash I'm gonna put
this on my bottom lashes and a little
bit on my top and then I use it makeup
for ever lip pencil I believe it's in
the shade number 13 I'll have it linked
down below and I'm using this essence I
think they call it a liquid lipstick but
it's definitely a lip gloss but it's
really pretty and lasts for a really
long time and then after that you were
all set so I hope you guys enjoy this
makeup look thank you so much for
watching have a safe new year thank you
guys for making this such a great year
and I will see you in 2017 found us got
the launch oh you gotta get across but
