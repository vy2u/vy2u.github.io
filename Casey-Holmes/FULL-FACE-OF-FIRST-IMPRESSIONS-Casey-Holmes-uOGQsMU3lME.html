today I'm going to be trying a bunch of
new products on my face we're going to
do a full face of first impression I'm
very excited to test all these products
out and let you know what I think of
them a lot of them are high-end but
there is some drugstore in here as well
so if you're interested Senate Leakey
POIs Qing and don't forget to subscribe
before you leave give it a thumbs up -
if you like these videos and yeah let's
just go ahead and get started before I
put my shadow shields on I'm going to go
ahead and try this new primer from a
Smashbox photo-finish lid primer in life
and I'm hoping this is going to be good
for oily eyelids so we will see it is
tempted as you can see so this shift
cancel out a lot of redness
discoloration reminds me of Mac Paint
Pot in soft ochre do you guys never
wanna see that all the freakin time for
so long ago getting a little tacky so
we're going to set this with a cream
eyeshadow or our face powder I forget if
there's a cream shadow in the palette
I'm going to use but we will set it just
so it's not sticky when we go in to
blend the first crease shade so I'm
going to go ahead and just pop on yes
this palette has it so this is probably
the coolest packaging I've ever seen it
is like a canvas feel and it has
painting all over it because they did
collaborate and this is just so stunning
I love the colors in here I think it's
very different very fun can be very very
smoky and it has three perfect shades
right here to start off your look so I'm
going to take this one so it has a
really nice smear as well I would
probably use it like this but it's up
and down hey my head watch the world so
I'm going to go ahead and take the first
shade admit an IgG ma I don't know why I
can do that and I'm gonna put this all
over my lid just to set this will just
gives a really nice smooth surface to
work with I'm going to go only up to the
brow alright we're ready to go so the
next color that I'm going to take is
actually levitation it's this one right
here which is right below the first one
and I'm going to take a fluffy crease
brush with my Mac I feel like I haven't
used this brush and so long I've been
decluttering my makeup and everything
and I found this brush and I was like oh
there you are I used to be obsessed with
that you're going to take that
levitation color with this brush
just blend this into the crease really
nice Krrish a because it's not too dark
not too light but it creates that nice
transition to the brow for me when I use
transition shades I don't like anything
you know too intense because you wanted
it to lighten up as it gets to the brow
now I'm going to take the morphe m4 for
three and with this one which is called
not for sale and I'm just going to go in
the crease with this but not go above
that first transition shade that we
applied I mean these three are my kind
of colors you know I don't know what
look I'm doing today I'm just going to
kind of try some different things out
and wing it so pray for me now I'm going
to do is I think all I really want to go
on with the believe I don't know how
it's going to look with the orange and I
want to do it I know what do you think
let's just see what it looks like right
it's so intense and blue this one right
here the shade damn I love that word
blend this right below the orange and
the crease okay not bad actually I don't
mind that with the orange see sometimes
you just gotta wing it you know speaking
of ween oh there's that tart eyeliner
I've been loving a new tart liner oh my
gosh I purchase it because I heard so
many good things about it
I see why everybody loves it it's so
good I also brought out these new tart
clay pots so I have Lucky Penny which
might look really pretty in the center
of the eye this is very Auburn right now
then I also have rose gold so I don't
know which one I want to use yet but I
don't want to bring the blue in the
inner corner as well and you like a halo
I going to take the Mac 239 again with
that dark blue and we're just going to
put this in the inner corner of the eye
as well since we're doing more of a halo
look we'll just bring it in and then
connect it middle you want something
that's kind of dense so you have full
control here in the inner corner
you guys love no I love a smoky look so
I'm always down to try a different
palette and do something intense with it
feel like that's when you really get to
see how it performs because you want
everything to blend so well what would
be so cool if I took this one because it
also got this liner
I thought would be cool on the water
line I don't know I'm kind of stepping
out my comfort zone tonight it's going
to take a very clean blending brush I'm
just going to clean the edge or I'm
going to blend these blue edges real
quick so I'm just going to just over it
and a little bit more orange in just a
second into the crease I'm going back in
with another brush and taking that
orange and lightly going right above
that blue just so we don't really use
that really pretty orange color I really
like this palette so far I think it's so
cool okay and now I think I'm going to
go ahead and do this point all over the
lid and maybe do a touch of rose gold on
the very center so again this is in the
shade Lucky Penny I haven't tried these
and I'm going to use a flat shader brush
so I'm going to use the Mac 242 and I'm
going to put this on the center of the
lid to get up to the crease kind of Pat
it out I'm wondering how this is going
to blend out and I think I'm going to
take a little bit of rose gold put this
in the center
just in the very center a little extra
pause I think it's pretty okay now I'm
going to go in with the dent shade that
we used with the blue and I'm just going
to kind of blend out these edges very
very lightly cool I like that I like the
palette a lot I think it's super super
pretty I think these little clay pots
are really awesome - they look really
nice on the lid hopefully they don't
crease I'm sure we'll see as the
tutorial goes on I don't think I have a
new link with a liner in there so this
is the Tarte man-eater liner and oh my
gosh this is a brush tip which I didn't
think I would like but I ended up really
loving it so I'm just going to go ahead
and do a winged liner okay so I'm going
to apply my lashes off-camera these are
the Lily lashes in the mikono
mokou nose so I'm going to be applying
these they're really pretty and fluffy
I'll be back to to the foundation
everything and really make this look
come together so now that elections are
on I'm going to go on with a new primer
this is the derma Col matte control
makeup base and it's oil-free says it's
an anti shine formula that lasts up to
18 hours but we are going to try this
out I got off of Amazon I showed it in
my I think it is derma called first
impressions or like a wear test I use it
not too long ago and I really do like
that foundation so I'm going to try this
primer a little squeezy tube and then
this is what it looks like I'm just
going to put this into my problem area
since it is such an intense anti-shine
product or at least it so I'm thinking I
will say it doesn't feel mattifying it
feels very silky like it doesn't feel
drying it also we'll see how it works
I'm going to try out this next
invincible fullest coverage foundation
in the shade a medium beige I hope it
matches me right now because I did apply
some self-tanner but we'll just have to
see amazing with a brush on one side and
then I sponge on the other so I'm going
to do the sponge first since it's right
here seems a little bit thick that's
looks like we'll be okay so it's not
looking like intense full coverage but
it is covering you can still see some
redness in here maybe a brush is the way
to go we will see and I don't know
hustled on it just yet
picks them down Nick so I'm super
splotchy here like I told you guys but
we're gonna have to work with it as it
looks like I am enough desolate right
now so we'll see how brush works I'm
going to use this Real Techniques brush
you're just going to put this on
there's not full coverage in my opinion
this is more medium buildable fullest
coverage foundation I think like super
intense not getting nothingness I don't
feel like this is full coverage I still
see some redness in here peeking through
oh I'm not feeling it all comes bad okay
I did bring my chart shape tape if we
don't get the coverage that I want from
this next concealer so this was sent to
me by number seven the brand that you
can get at Target in this is the radiant
glow under-eye concealer doesn't sound
like it would be super full covered
that's why I brought the heart-shaped
tapes so it's a clicky pin see what
working with here this is a shade ten so
hopefully this will give us a little
more coverage in here no the biggest fan
of clicky pins let you know the products
good then why not it's very sheer
because I can still see all this redness
peeking through here it's not it's not
bad it's just not what I want for this
look when I have this dramatic when I
want a full coverage concealer so the
color I'm using is light/medium so right
in here and blend it out yeah see like
this is the coverage I need or a
concealer so I know it's not claiming at
the full coverage concealer I think if
you want to use it like kind of like I
do I always do the Tarte shape tape here
in inner corner and then something
lighter on the outer half I mean you
could do that with the number seven
concealer so it's not bad I just wanted
it a little bit more full coverage so I
just applied this on top which also this
Tarte shaped tip is blending really well
on top of this concealer all about what
you're looking for what you need for
your specific look but I like it I mean
I'll keep it I'll probably use it on
other parts of my face
because it looks nice on my forehead and
everything now many is this really
expensive
loose powder this is the clay 2po
translucent loose powder is huge I
bought this for ever go for like a
expensive haul but I never played with
it I don't know why but look at how
pretty this packaging is so pretty it's
the first time I'm seeing it actually
and you just lift it up right
oh you twist it up that's kind of nice
then you have this little number oh is
it the sister you put on you have really
nice sponge let me get that dirty twist
this off okay so you could twist it off
and have it open like that but she might
want put the sister on right right wait
no is that that with us for basic paper
ring directly into powder and set
intermeshed on top Oh
place this paper directly onto powder
and set intermesh on top okay I don't
know kind of nice like it's a little
messy though and I bake my face with
this looks really pretty actually so is
a colorless powder I mean I'd like a
little peep tint to it but nothing crazy
kind of smells get to it smells kind of
floral II I could be wrong so that's
what smells like to me I kind of like
the powder thing on top it's a better
idea than just letting it float loosely
though I'm going to do my eyebrows let
this bake and then I'll come back
another good thing is you could take
this and twist this back on top and then
again take the top and twist this on so
it's a little messy but like when you're
traveling at least you have two forms of
like twisty tops to make sure it doesn't
get absolutely everywhere so I don't
have a new brow product to share with
you guys so I'm just going to use my
makeup revolution we're gonna let this
bake and I'm going to come back and
we're going to finish off the rest of
the face and it goes okay my brows are
on and now I'm going to go ahead and
dust away the baking so I'm just going
to use this duo fiber brush from anyway
this is a TS brand
making my skin look really really smooth
okay so I have two different bronzer
type things to share with you guys new
one that Becca came out with which I did
purchase and then they sent me the
collection which I just donated that and
kept the one that I purchased is the
Becca sunlit bronzer in Capri coast and
the packaging is really pretty same with
their highlighters and then you open it
up and this is what looks like it does
look like it has some shimmer in it
actually it does let's just be honest
looks like more of a glowy bronzer very
light when it's not on my face it'll be
okay so we'll see how this works but I
also have these from it cosmetics see
confidence in your glow skin
transforming healthy flush blushing the
bronzer also came with a brush I don't
know if you have to use a brush with it
but it says it's your blush bronzer and
highlighter in one sweet color that I'm
thinking of using is this one right here
I have more of a peach tone in it and
this one's in the shade of instant warm
glow I believe so I'm going to look at
this let's see if we have like a video
on how to do it all as you see how she
has and Helen loves writing like a wash
over my face so what they're doing it's
very simple they're taking it and
putting it all over their face which I
wouldn't think to put blush and a
mixture of highlighter and bronzer all
over my skin but we'll try it for this
video this is the packaging I will say
this packaging is freaking gorgeous I
think they have some really great
products that have great packaging and
then this is what it looks like so
basically what they did is they took the
brush sweep it and put it all over their
face we're going to see how this works
so this brush is really soft it has it's
more dense right in here and then it
feathers up to just a lighter kind of
duo-fiber feel just could do what they
did and hopefully we look okay okay that
I'm just gonna
I don't think I'm going to like the idea
of this just for like that reason right
there oh hell no I think it separately
it would be better not I don't think
mixing the colors and putting them on
your face is a great idea blush the
bronzer all over the skin I mean it
looks nice but I guess maybe if you want
like an everyday quick easy like sweep
all over yes but I do not like the hint
of blush right up here I feel like it
doesn't work for me I don't know but you
can also use them individually if you
wanted to they're very pigmented so I
mean if you want to try it out try it
out I'm going to take just a little bit
to contour very powdery holy so
pigmented oh my gosh I don't know how I
feel about this just yet I don't like
the idea of this all over it's just not
not the look I'm going for
I mean it does look pretty what do you
guys think of it I think maybe if it was
hints of different colored bronzers for
all over the face I see where they were
going with it but I do not like this
color on my forehead and I'm not the
biggest fan of highlighter all over my
face luckily this is just a nice sheen
so it just gives you a glow it doesn't
emphasize texture or anything that's
nice I do like it I think you need to
play with it more about this I think
would be really great for contouring
just a little just a little something
there the brush is really nice quality
so we're going to try out this becca
bronzer on the other side of our face
again it's in the shade capri coat
that is pretty that's like a nice
natural-looking bronzer oh I love that
now I want more colors I kind of wish I
went through the colors before I got rid
of all of them you see the difference
though this one's more rosy this one's
definitely more tan and that's because
you had to take the blush on the
forehead as well and the cheek at least
the way they're telling you to apply it
look at this Becca bronzer Wow many is
the smaller brush that I use as a
cosmetics line take it in the Becca as
well and just do a little bit of contour
don't need much because we're pretty
bronzed right now we've got some color
on our face now okay now I'm so in with
this BH Cosmetics nude rose sculpting
glow palette looks interesting to me
looks like it has three bronzers blush
and to highlight according to the back
so thing on I am going to use this blush
in the palette because this one has a
lot of shimmer in it I'm going to use
this I'm not going to use these
highlight powders this matte cream one
looks like a really nice powder to set
your under-eye with if you're not into
really baking I think you would like
that I'm going to take this blush color
right here I'm just going to very
lightly it barely any on the brush put
this on my cheeks because it cosmetics
ones does pretty glow up alright we're
done with blushes bronzers all of that
so now we're going to move on to
highlighter this is new from Stila it's
the heavens hue highlighter in the shade
kitten and this is a different
highlighter I'm interested to test it
out so it just looks like this in the
package and then this is what the
product looks like very interesting not
a powder I wouldn't necessarily say it's
a cream but it looks pretty intense and
they're most known for their shade
kittens so of course they had to come
out with a highlighter like this I know
they have a few more shades but this is
the one I wanted to try because I know I
love kittens one see how this looks on
the skin I'm going to take this elf
brush this is the elf flawless concealer
brush I'm going to dip it in here or
swirl it just imply on sulfur cheek
Wow like a wet look
now this kind of highlight does
emphasize texture so just keep that in
mind so I would keep this back away from
your pores if you like me and you have
texture I wouldn't say this is like
everyday highlight for me this would be
more of like very very glam like I have
on right now but it is really nice I'm
going to see what this looks like on my
waterline this is that same Urban Decay
jean-michel collaboration this is a new
shade anatomy that is intense my god
look at how easy that applies for a
colored liner that just applied so well
and I'm really kind of feeling it on my
brown eyes this collaboration like oh my
god loving everything so far I think it
is so cool it just makes you want to
step outside your comfort zone and try
new things Sam that was cool okay now
I'm going to take this thick and fast
mascara from 7 Glory we're not gonna be
able to really tell if this is very
volumizing but I am going to coat my
bottom lashes with it and I'm going to
put a little bit on the upper lashes
just to blend a little bit more ok so I
have it on my bottom lashes it's making
them look really feathery but not very
volumizing so I wonder how this would
look on your top lashes you know what I
mean now I have to move on the lips and
I have no idea what I'm going to put on
my lips because of this super dramatic
eye okay so I have these new Victoria
Secret lip colors these are the Velvet
Matte cream lip stains but I also
brought this just in case a little too
dark and needs to be lightened up this
one is in the shade perfection I've had
these forever I actually has a whole
line but I just haven't had a chance to
try them out whoa look how pigmented wow
these are pigmented I'm going to take
some of this makeup because showstopper
these are our cream stains and this
one's in dosey doe I'm going to put this
in the center of my lips not obsessed
with the packaging of this just because
the top is so small it's like short so
it's kind of hard to open and stuff I
don't know this is me
so this is the completed look let me
know what you guys think in the comments
below I think my standout products are
this eyeshadow palette this is just such
a fun palette something you kind of get
outside your covers them with and still
also use neutrals it just has a nice
pops of color in here if you want to
kind of do something different this
liner is insane this is again that same
collab with urban decay and jean-michel
so I have in my waterline it is just so
cool I love this I think this eyeshadow
primer is gonna be really great from
Smashbox I guess this is the photo
finish lid primer in light and so far
I'm not creasing and another really
standout product is definitely this
Becca bronzer in the shade Capri coast
this I think is going to be one of my
new favorite bronzers just because it
looks beautiful on the skin it looks
like a natural tan and I really like it
a lot so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know down below in the
comments what you want to try out from
this video it was so much fun I really
loved the look is something very smoky
dramatic a little different which is
what I love thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
