to be sharing with you a video where we
try out a bunch of new drugstore
products these are things that I have
not tried before we've got some new
collab lashes from eyelure and with
jasmine brown we have this NYX palette
right here I mean I think I have
everything for a full face of drugstore
that's new so I'm very excited I'm gonna
test a little stuff out for you guys let
you know what I think if you're not
subscribed already be sure to hit that
subscribe button before you leave and if
you're interested in seeing all of the
new drugstore makeup I have for you guys
then let's just go ahead and get started
first thing we have is this Revlon
Colorstay eyeshadow primer and this is a
universal shade it says it has shea
butter care complex and it wears up to
24 hours so this is the primary we're
gonna be trying today
pretty sure I really do think I have a
product for everything like all my
primers foundation concealers we've got
a lot of new steps has a little bit of a
tint to it I'm excited to see if this
will let cancel out any discoloration my
skin has been so smooth and moisturized
recently actually shared with you guys
in my last video my favorites video the
sleeping mask I've been using that I
love but also when I'm not using that
I'm using two products mixed together
that are very moisturizing been really
doing great things for my skin I don't
know if you guys can tell but I feel
like my texture and stuff has been
really good recently okay now this is
not gonna counteract anything really
texture has been really good recently I
mean not really good I mean it's still
there but it's been doing better okay so
this primer doesn't really give you a
nice clean base I am hoping that this
primer doesn't crease on me because I
have a problem with a lot of primers
creasing just because I do have very
oily eyelid going on I'm gonna be trying
this NYX ultimate palette and this is so
pretty this one's in the shade sugar hi
I know this has been out for a little
while
but I really wanted to try it today I
thought it was super pretty if you're
wondering what my shortest from is from
adidas by the way figured I'll let you
guys know I'm gonna use this white cream
shade very pigmented I'm gonna set that
primer because it's really important to
go ahead and set it that way we don't
have
any eye shadow moving I have a feeling
UPS is here and the dogs are no crazy I
have a feeling I might be wrong I think
I heard a door back in action now all
right I'm gonna apply some tape it's
just my preference or in this video
you're probably gonna hear me huffing
and puffing because I just ran upstairs
Daisy are you okay she had like a treat
stuck to her mouth like the roof roof of
her mouth
are you okay my sweet girl she made me
never she started crying so this palette
has three different rows you have like a
matte row one with like a little bit of
machine and then more glitters here at
the top which i think is really cool I'm
gonna go in with this one right here and
put this into my crease and I'm gonna
really blend this out because this is
gonna be our transition shade
I love matte eyeshadows I just feel like
that gives such a clean look I also love
glitter I don't really like Sheen's
I like either Matt's or really intense
glitter you know what I mean I'm not
really into like a sheen like a slight
sparkle I'm either let's go big or go
home or keep it matte I'm gonna go in
with this kind of pinky tone using the
same brush I'm going to maybe that's
just a little too light yeah I think
that one's a little too light I actually
also have this Gigi Hadid collection
palette here this is super expensive I
bought this at Ulta I think this was
like $30 remember when this is like the
rage and I haven't used it the sleeve of
the package is really pretty I haven't
seen really any reviews on it I think I
saw taught to use review and that was it
I'm gonna go in with this matte Brown
right here got a lot of color and we're
just going to blend this right
underneath that first shade we used okay
that's not bad it's got quite a bit of
powder kick up but honestly when it
comes to drugstore I'm not like picky
about the kind of stuff I'm gonna take
the Mac 217 and I'm gonna go in with
this color right here
dude I've been really addicted to
fixer-upper you guys I mean I was
already addicted but it's to the point
where now like it's snowing I wake up
and they're playing reruns like all the
time so then I just sit on the couch and
I start watching the first rerun and
then I see the second third and I'm like
I've seen this five hundred times that
I'm still watching it over and over and
over again I actually think I might take
this color right here and put this all
over the lid and go straight in with
this on one eye and then if it doesn't
work out well there is an exclude or
glue that I have and I'll try that out
as well but I want to see how this looks
first like I'm gonna get fallout
everywhere but we're just gonna try it
because not everyone has glitter glue
it's not as like BAM in your face as
when i swatched it so I'm going to use
the two-faced glitter glue this is a
great alternative to the two-faced
glitter glue that I'm obsessed with this
is just a more affordable option
I do recommend this because it does kind
of keep it all in place have a little
bit of eye shadow left over so it's
already kind of getting okay so I just
put this exactly where I want to put the
eye shadow I don't let it sit long I go
straight in with the glitter and I put
this on top I like to press it in you
see the difference between this eye and
this eye it's more carved out thanks to
that glitter glue and it's much more
intense on this eye which I enjoy so I
think it is a really pretty color but I
definitely think glitter glue is the way
to go with it it just adds the extra
umph if you're like me and you like
sparkle and you like the UM I think
you'll really really like that one thing
I am going to do is I am going to take
that same brush we used for the deeper
purple on the outer half and just go
back in and kind of touch it up a little
bit and deepen it up to be a really
pretty valentine's day look it's not too
intense but it's still smoky I'm gonna
use a new eyeliner today this is
supposed to be a matte eyeliner this is
the Milani stay put
matte eyeliner in black it's a felt tip
very excited about that seventeen hour
we're bold matte finish humidity and
resistant packaging is nice and matte as
well that drives down really quickly so
that eyeliner is very black and very
matte I'm excited about it kinda reminds
me of the makeup for everyone that I'm
obsessed with next up we are gonna apply
these Jasmine Brown lashes and I'll or I
love I'll or and I feel like these are
stunning I'm going to take these cut
them glue them onto my face and then
I'll be back to apply a ton of different
face products so we're gonna go ahead
and move on to foundation concealers you
got so much here so we have this Rimmel
lasting finish 25 hour breathable long
wear foundation high definition finish
medium coverage 402 bronze I might try
this one out the only thing kind of
holding me back is it says medium
coverage and then I also have this best
blend forever makeup from all may I
don't know it's just not calling my name
maybe because the packaging is kind of
boring so I'll go into this one we'll
use the Rimmel lasting finish for primer
I'm going to try something a little bit
different this is the Milani instant
touch-up a blur stick so this is what it
looks like you can use it to prime you
can use it to control shine so you can
apply it throughout the day to minimize
shine and oil I don't really believe in
this kind of stuff I've seen it around
with different high-end brands and all
that but I don't put on more primer or a
bomb on my face throughout the day it's
not oily I just bought that mess and go
about my day I use the Pilate o blotting
sheets and they're the best
you don't need powder because one side
has like a regular blinding sheet the
other side is kind of like a powder
finish so it kind of powders and blots
at the same time it's perfection anyways
this is what it looks like it's just a
little bomb to be honest with you it
look I feel like it might make me more
oily but we'll just keep it moving it's
another thing with these bombs like they
say that they flare out pores fine lines
all of that but I find that they make me
more oily half the time just because
they're very slick on the skin and they
normally just don't work out for me okay
so again this is the Rimmel lasting a
finish 24 hour or
sorry 25 our breathable foundation kind
of oh okay what a different spatula so
this looks like okay so this this is the
applicator this is I'm like all over the
place this is what the applicator looks
like it's like a little dough so it kind
of like the Tarte one looks a little
different looks like it holds more
product and oh yeah holds a lot more
product so we'll see oh and it's really
like flimsy in a way it's flimsy the
right word
I don't know has a lot of movement which
I actually enjoy because it just kind of
moves the foundation you know what I
mean
that's probably too much but I I like
the way that dope it feels in my face
I'm going to use a Beauty Blender and
I'm going to tap this out it's probably
a little too dark but I thought it was
gonna be a good shade my mistake okay so
it's a little orange and this is in the
shade 402 bronze it is definitely medium
coverage you can see a lot of redness
still peeking through you know it does
have a nice finish I'm just going to do
my neck and yours in a moment but here's
what it looks like on this side then
again here you can see the rosacea going
up on the nose but it does say medium
coverage so you can't fault them for
that it does feel really nice it kind of
has like a cooling sensation everybody
needs this stuff the applicator on their
foundations because it is so nice to
apply your foundation with I'll just do
this side and hope concealer can help us
with any extra coverage / the color is
just like really really really warm so
I'm gonna take this off because the
color is just really not good and when
there's something so orange and already
have red in my skin it just looks a mess
okay so this is all my foundation I'm
reading on it right now it says the key
benefits to this is that it's buildable
coverage with a lightweight comfortable
feel for radiant luminous skin built-in
removable blending sponge buffs skin to
a beautiful finish has SPF 40 a hydrate
and up to eight hours because it's
formulated with hyaluronic acid and
there it says it perfects and corrects
hypoallergenic dermatologist tested
fragrance free oil free I'm just gonna
I'm gonna try it with this sponge first
and then won't go from there this was
too light
I hate these sponges on the foundations
like no all right let's try this
it's not terrible like it's looking okay
it's kind of covering the redness I
think I'm just gonna keep going with
this one
cuz I don't have another foundation to
try since it has SPF 40 I wonder if it
has a series flashback
it doesn't look terrible though like it
actually does look good if I had the
right shade okay so what we'll do is
we'll try a brush to try and build up
the coverage what I like to do when I'm
trying to get more coverage is I'll just
Pat it in that way it doesn't like move
around do here's what it looks like it's
just you got to use a lot of product to
get a good coverage and for me I have
other drugstore foundations that are
used for full coverage I will say this
does not advertise to be full coverage
so if you want something that's more
medium go for it if you build it up it
does feel heavy so just keep that in
mind I want to try actually this Catrice
camouflage cream it's a wake up effect
so basically it's supposed to counteract
any darkness it's supposed to a
corrector it's got a peachy tone to it
see how it looks easy underneath our
concealer I've had this in my drawer
forever and I just really want to try it
so I'm going to take a little brush from
Kat Von D and we're going to put this
right where we're really dark I'm not
using a ton of this because we're
putting concealer on top okay now we're
going in with a concealer that everyone
has been talking about and I have tried
it a few times and I'm not obsessively
the first couple times I've tried this I
blended it out with a brush I'm gonna
blend it out with a Beauty Blender today
see if I like it a little bit better see
if it adds a little more more moisture
to the concealer but it's the makeup
revolution conceal and define concealers
I'm going to be using the shade c6 I had
c4 and c6 so I'm just gonna use c6 today
a lot of people are comparing this to
Tarte shape tape and I don't know guys
let's see how it works with a Beauty
Blender before I tell you my thoughts
because to be honest when I applied it
with a brush I looked really really dry
like incredibly drying I didn't want to
come on here and say I don't like it
to try it out like to me this is not
full coverage it moves around quickly on
me and to be honest my redness shows
through
even with this concealer it does that
thing where it has a lot of coverage
here but not in the cheek area which is
where I really need coverage and then
when I try to apply more even now it
just looks kind of heavy I mean maybe if
you don't have a lot to cover up but I
like to use concealer to help with a my
under eyes but also the redness
underneath I wanted to like it so bad
but it's just it doesn't work for me it
doesn't fit my needs I'm going to use
this new L'Oreal infallible Pro a sweep
and lock translucent setting powder this
is what it looks like I have not tried
this before so I'm really excited
it says the texture is micro-fine the
action says it fixes and the use is for
post makeup this is a translucent powder
obviously kind of has that white tint to
it so actually I think what I'm gonna do
is just set my under eyes with this and
then going with a flower beauty powder
to set the rest of the face so we're
just using this sponge looks really nice
I'm going to be honest it will probably
cause a flashback in photography because
it is so light so like I said for the
rest of my face I am going to go in with
the powder foundation this is from
flower beauty really excited to try all
the new flower beauty products coming
out because they have a lot of stuff on
Ultra that they've been teasing but just
haven't come out with yeah okay so I'm
going to try to bronze with this golden
Soleil baked bronzer from jcat Beauty so
this is what it looks like I'm a little
nervous
using a bunch of products I'm nervous
about I don't know that looks pretty
just looks like I has sheen to it not
glitter which is nice oh my gosh
I feel like if I liked my concealer I
would like the bronzer better just cuz
it be more smooth and seamless but I do
think it looks nice like it doesn't look
bad
definitely added some color so I know I
can already see it in the comments now
something you're gonna think like if
this is your first video you've ever
seen of me
you're gonna think I absolutely hate
drugstore makeup and anything affordable
but I swear I don't I use drugstore all
the time I'm going into this palette
this is not technically a drugstore but
it is more on the affordable side this
is from TJ Maxx is the profusion contour
palette looks really similar to the cap
on d1 I use a different profusion
palette that I've shown you guys before
it has highlighters in it and it's
amazing it's so good you have to go get
it it's like a little book it's just
phenomenal so I wanted to try this out
since it does look so similar to that
kat von d palette these are all mattes
in powder formulas to be honest I wonder
why this brands at t.j.maxx it seems
like they have really good products so
it's what it looks like isn't it so
pretty you have a huge mirror now what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my
bronzer brush and I'm gonna go in with
this color right here okay so I wouldn't
recommend the brush and I'm using with
it this is actually a new Mac brush 1:25
brush I wouldn't use this brush with it
because it really picks up a lot of
product this is more if you want to use
like a lighter bronzer or something not
so pigmented I mean that that contour
palette is nice it really is it blends
out as you can see I just took this
little kind of more dense duo fiber
brush from Smashbox it's the stippling
foundation brush it still has a lot of
movement but since the bristles are like
those duo fiber bristles they blend out
really nicely and more precise I'm gonna
go in with this yellow tone and that
same brush these are very pigmented
which I'm not surprised because the
other one is super pigmented too I'm
gonna carve out underneath our contour
so this is the other profusion palette
that I'm obsessed with you can get it at
t.j.maxx but this one has like those
contour shades but it has highlighters
and it comes with brushes and you can
see how much I've used this I actually
forgot to mention this in my favourites
video but it's definitely a favorite
even though it is a chunky palette I
traveled with this and loved it because
it's so good and you also get brushes
this is one of the brushes and I love
it's just like a little angled brush
perfect for contouring your nose which
is what I'm going to do right now I kind
of feel like my face is coming together
with like contour I think blush and
highlight will help and brows will help
a lot too now we're going into the NYX
sweet cheeks
palette I'm excited about this I love a
good blush pie I love that it's
affordable and to be honest I love NYX
so I'm not gonna be surprised if I
really like this product I'm think I'm
gonna mix this one in this one together
taking more of that mall tap it off you
guys see this looks like something
didn't just what it looks like is going
on right here if you guys I'm gonna get
you in close the foundations just like
rubbing off I'm gonna use this
Physicians Formula butter highlighter
it's a cream to powder highlighter this
one's in the shade pearl
I like the butter bronzers so don't be
surprised if I like this ooh
so this is what it looks like it's very
pretty
twist off top love that it feels really
good it feels like I don't even know
what it feels like that coconut what is
this this smells like when you're making
rice krispie treats and you just melted
all the butter and stuff it's definitely
a cream to powder formula oh my god now
this foundation sides coming off
I'm gonna use the Maybelline total
temptation brow definer I got the shade
blonde this does have like a little tiny
spoolie on the end the product this
looks pretty dark for blonde we start
filling in the brows okay this is
actually not bad I like the formula I
kind of like it we got a product I like
okay moving on and we're going to set my
brows I'm gonna use this wet wild
ultimate brow mascara that you guys saw
in my favorites video I just really like
it this is gonna help kind of lighten up
the brows again make it look a little
bit more natural so what I do I know
you're probably scared so I apply it
first and then I go in with a clean
spoolie which this little brush music is
from ELF and
I just blend it out and it really just
makes them look a little bit more
natural like brow hairs nothing crazy so
I'm back years later feeling better you
know why I'm feeling better I had
something to eat I'm gonna wrap it up
with a new product from Catrice it's
called lip cushion and this one's gonna
make a better moth very interesting I've
never tried this before the color if
we're going by the packaging looks
really pretty oh so you just twist it up
okay says is a creamy lip gloss with
avocado oil with an ultra cushiony
sponge applicator for an incredible
smooth application and an extremely soft
lip the feeling love it okay does feel
good
probably should have lined my lips but
we'll just work we'll work with it okay
guys so I'm actually gonna wrap it up
here and finish it off I do like the lip
product I think it is really nice very
very moisturizing very shiny and glossy
so if you like that look you might
really really like this I definitely
didn't go like as planned but a lot of
you I went on snapchat I was talking
about how I didn't know if I want to
upload this but I think I'm going to
just because I give high-end products a
bad review if they're not good so we're
just gonna keep it at that we're gonna
upload this video if I don't like
something I don't like it there's a few
things that I do like really quickly let
me talk about them the total temptation
eyebrow product I actually really like
this it was easy to use it's like the
flower Beauty where's this powder
foundation this was nice just to like
set my face with I do really like this
palette as well has really good
pigmentation a good color scheme I think
it's really pretty so I think that's it
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope you appreciate my honest opinion on
products that's what I'm here for and I
will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
