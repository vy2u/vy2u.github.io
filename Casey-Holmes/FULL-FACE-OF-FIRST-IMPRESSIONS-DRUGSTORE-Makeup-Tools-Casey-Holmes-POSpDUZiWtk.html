today is an expelled lab sorry so today
is an exciting video because I went to
Walmart yesterday looking for a new drug
store brand mess out that I cannot find
yet but it only went to one so stay with
me because I have two more to go to if I
can't find it but I went to a drug store
trying to find this new brand because I
want to do a full video dedicated to new
drugstore brands so if you guys know any
let me know in the comments I had a
different brand semi PR that I never
heard of that set Rite Aid and Target
then I'm going to do video on and like
test them out in the video and then I
want to try this other brand and then I
think there's one more even though I
could not find this brand I did find so
many new products that I wanted to test
out because Walmart is like a hidden gem
in the drugstore delight I don't know
about you guys letting overdose to
either Ulta or Walgreens and let me just
say ultra hug Green is a lot more
expensive than Walmart so just wear your
favorite sweatpants and go to Walmart
and get your favorite makeup for a lower
price
everything that I'm wearing on my face
right now is drugstore I believe the
only thing that is not drugstore is my
eyeshadow primer just because I want to
give these I chose a fair shot and very
impressed with everything that I have on
my face and I cannot wait to be like a
wear test on some of this stuff I think
the face product that I use like the BB
cream is going to be a new favorite I
can already tell don't forget to give it
a thumbs up for drugstore makeup because
we all love just to makeup and also
don't forget to subscribe before you
leave and yeah you want to see how I got
this drugstore makeup look then let's
just go ahead and get started
alrighty so the first thing we're going
to do is put this name up so I would
like crap so first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to pry my eyes and my name
is a what is this is my natural primer I
think give these eyeshadows a fair shot
and this is my NARS smudge proof
eyeshadow base my favorite if you have
oily eyelids this is a must-have
a lot of people asked in my last video
where Davis purchased all my makeup from
Sephora and had to put it on a lot of
you asked why I didn't use that
concealer as an eyeshadow primer and
that's because I have very oily eyelids
like super oily and that concealer I
used is very luminous and I knew
no it would just be such a hot mess if I
put it on I skipped that part we just
went without it you know what I mean so
many is today I'm really excited about
because I saw it in store at Walmart
knows like what it is a hard candy matte
eyeshadow Pro palette all of these
eyeshadows are met as a matte eyeshadow
lover so I saw this and I had to have it
that is gorgeous this better be good
pigmentation if this does not blend well
or something I'm going to be really sad
this palette comes with two brushes I
can't stand easy so this is how it comes
with two dual ended brushes but the
first thing I'm going to do is take this
shade right here and I'm going to set my
entire lid I'm really hoping these
shades are as good as I feel like
they'll be because if not I'm usually
disappointed okay
so I'll first show you when I'm pretty
well now I'm going to go in with this
blending brush and I'm actually going to
take you want to take this shade right
here and I'm going to blend this into my
crease this one right here is speaking
to me but we'll get to that in a moment
so far it's looking pretty decent
I also got another eyeshadow palette
from flower beauty which I might try to
dabble in today but we'll see but I
heard great things about once about that
as well I haven't really tried a lot of
flower beauty products - the loose
powder that you guys know I'm obsessive
so I definitely picked up a few things
from Drew Barrymore's brand and figured
I would try it out free banana shade and
put that in the crease as well but a
little bit below that transition shade
mmm that's pretty so right in the crease
don't throw balls at first she would put
on then I'm going to take some of this
red I'm going to bring it in from the
outer half to Midway on the lid so about
right there and also drag it into the
crease I like that it's not too
overpowering I mean you could tell us
more of a warm red shade but it's not
too much you know what I mean but I
think people would look at this in the
palette and be like whoa what I'm going
to do is that it's not too intimidating
at all I think that is really really
pretty oh I love red and orange eye
shadows like for spring/summer you guys
know can't get away from them really
liking it I'm liking it I'm liking it
cool okay now we're going to reach in to
the flower beauty pattern of it I'm
going to reach in to the flower Beauty
palette this is oh it has a bonus $6
brush which is nice the only thing I've
noticed thing about it that I normally
do every time I do my eye shadow is that
I don't see a matte cream color in here
it's just all shimmer but I mean that's
okay so I always use a face powder to
set my lids you know and it looks me too
crazy about it but it does have some
really nice blue left color that's a
really pretty shade right here oh okay
so I'm going to take the darkest brown
I'm going to use the brush it's in the
palette cut that off with like quite a
bit on the brush I'm just going to put
this in the RV Wow not going to go too
far with it because I want the red to
really show I'm using this just in the
RV to really deep
it up also taking it a little bit into
the crease again not too much then I'm
going to go back in that red tone shade
I'm going to blend it out and that way
you can see it so I'm just going to take
it on the edges a little bit in the
crease mainly right here in the middle
of the lid now we're going to spice up
the inner corner a little bit and we're
going to take one of the shimmery shades
again from the flower beauty powder I am
pretty impressed with this dark brown I
mean look at that that is really nice I
mean that wasn't like the best swatch
but that was really nice so I'm going to
take this Mac 242 and I think I'm going
to go in with more of a golden shade in
the very inner corner just to really
make it pop and then we'll use the other
liars shades to highlight the brow bone
and stuff when we're done I'm sorry
looks like so annoying
I'm just cleaning it so I'm think I'm
going to go in with this one right here
like a gold champagne color very pretty
nice and light and it looks really
pigmented wow that's a brush watch I'm
going to put this right in here okay I
love these two palettes together okay
awesome so that's the eye shadow look
with these two palettes if you bought
both of them together is around $26 USD
I really like it I really love this
matte palette to be quite honest with
you I want to swatch the black in it
real quick just to see how intense it is
is some fallout but I can get over that
okay the black is not very intense um
more sheer that's just one slice this is
like built up so if you don't like
something like that yeah the black
doesn't swatch very well but then again
I have not done all my eye so look a
little bit better but if you don't want
something too deep that might be the
black for you because some people don't
want a super intense black you know what
I mean so I'm going to eat this hard
candy 12 hours much pre felt tip
eyeliner it looks really nice on the
packaging so let's watch it it's a nice
black liner right there it's so it looks
like up close at the felt tip which I
love felt tip liner is going to be
completely up to you if you like felt
tip or not so let's just see how this
applies
okay not in love
then they get another liner difficult to
work with it's really it tugs on the eye
and the subsets like to dry for me it's
not saturated with product like I like
so I'm going to give this one a thumbs
down but I did buy the flower beauty
liquid liner it's water-resistant
all-day wear and this is a brush tip
liner so y'all pray for me because I
haven't done a brush tip liner so long
but the packaging looks like wait is
that it that's the flower beauty and
it's a felt tip it looked like a brush
tip on the packaging so now I'm pumped
so for just a couple dollars more you
can get a much more black and intense
liner just clean that up with a makeup
wipe so that is a nice black liner
looking like a shrine mat alright so we
fixed it up we clean everything up
looking better already
we're going to put some mascara on our
top lashes I'm just going to use this
essence the false E or the false lashes
mascara I'm not like trying this out
I'll let you guys know what I think in
my hips and mrs. if I like it or not for
a dramatic mascara but I just need
something really quick to coat my lashes
before I put falsies on so I'm going to
quickly put on these false lashes these
I have not tried from the eye lower line
they're the Vegas nay fiercely fabulous
I also found my gilded ones like the
faux meet lashes at Walmart to it these
are like 948 or something pretty sure it
also they're like 40 something so like
that's every makeup product that like
you can get a portrait cheaper at
Walmart I'm going to see how these look
just touch them out but these do have a
bit of a thicker band kind of like
they're regular Iowa or lashes if you
get the faux mink ones and gilded
they're not this stick
I think these could be pretty so I'm
going to measure these off glue them I'm
going to come back we're going to do
face and then put these on now today
we're going to try a BB cream and this
is the flower Beauty BB cream it's in
the shade BB 3 the display said that it
was a full coverage map BB cream so
that's what got me because it's at full
coverage and Matt in the same sentence
so I was like okay I have to try that
i'ma try to BB cream and go along I need
to go get the Garnier BB cream and do a
throwback throw down on it pretty
packaging that's what it looks like and
then you have this harder lid right here
so please this color is not too terrible
I'm going to use this elf ultimate
blending brush to apply it says apply
with your fingers but you know I'm not
going to do that oh that's what I get
for saying I'm not going to do that
these are not makeup clip pants okay
this looks a little dark but you can see
we can make it work not going to use a
primer because holy shitake mushrooms I
mean you guys see it right this is a BB
cream okay so it is quite a bit darker
than I am I thought my self tanner would
work today but not as hard is this holy
crap that is like a full day and ion is
full coverage so this is the note primer
because usually when you apply BB cream
you don't have to apply a primer okay so
- the fact that is so dark
we'll have concealer on so we'll make it
a little bit better but that is
definitely a full coverage BB cream I've
never seen that before
like is that intense and full coverage
hopefully our concealer you know
lightens us up a bit but that is I mean
with one stroke Wow I mean cover it up
so you can mix this in with your
foundations if you need it to be a
little bit darker because the color like
the tone is really nice and it's so
lightweight let's see how it looks when
it's said but so far it is looking
really nice so I'm actually going to use
the LA girl Pro conceal this is in the
shade natural I just want to test it out
again I'm going to use the equal tools
perfecting blender duo mini this one
here to blend it out because I've seen
it everywhere and I've wanted to try it
so bad for great things about it their
cruelty free they recycle okay so it did
get quite a bit bigger
and it feels really nice and squishy so
that's it looks like after you wet it
seems really nice so again I'm going to
use the LA girl Pro concealer and
natural highlight the face a little bit
I like that this end is like really
defined so you don't mess up your liquid
liner because I do that all the time I
like this but if you like this end just
a little too thin for me we're starting
like a little bit more put together now
flash has a really thick band not quite
feeling it
I'm not putting these on the lash band
is just way too thick so many of my
favorite I'll or gilded lashes these are
amazing okay so now I'm going to set I'm
going to use one of my favorites
powders it's the LA girl Pro powder and
it's in the shade banana yellow just a
light hint of yellow nothing too crazy
I'm just going to bake my face with it
this is going to be good baking sponge
oh yeah nice all right so we are baking
a lot and I'm going to go ahead and go
in and do my brows I'm going to use this
new elf beautifully precise brush it's a
brow brush and dual ended which is what
I love and it reminded me of my Sephora
brow brush so I'm going to see if it's a
dupe so that's what it looks like right
there I'm going to use my makeup
revolution brow pomade in the shade
blonde I love this brow pomade this one
in the elf brow and liner cream oh my
gosh is so good
this is always my good brow like this
brow just kill of it every time other
brow tell so much I really like that
brush I do that brush the two thumbs up
I feel like it did a really great job
then the same job that my Sephora one
does and as Schooley on the end so it
gets my recommendation so if you that's
the way the baking I'm going to use this
elf beautifully precise airbrush blender
the brush is so pretty so soft it's got
a little angle to it I'm intrigued the
handle is so pretty okay so we're just
going to just go into baking I like how
it's angle so it gets right underneath
the eye it's really dusting everything
away beautifully it's a very soft brush
look guys do you look a little normal
now I'm going to use something a little
different again to contour I'm going to
use this flower Beauty lift and sculpt
contouring palette I think this is the
one that I've heard everybody rave about
so now I'm going to take my Real
Techniques setting brush I'm going to go
in with a bronzer very lightly it is
very powdery keep that in mind it's
going to contour the face
lighter the hands the better loses these
and intense all right this is lending
out really nicely I'm actually liking it
a lot
I was helping since it was so creamy
that a Wed boned out really well and it
definitely did
so like that a lot then I'm going to
take the blush in the palette and I'm
going to put that on my cheek so I think
I really didn't dip into it that much
but I got a lot of payoff I really like
this blush color because this is the
kind of blush color that I go for
something like a flush
you know you get rid of the redness and
then you put a pack on your face what
you put it where you want it you know
can I just say I feel like this BB cream
is holding up really well because I've
been blending so much on my face with
these brushes that is just holding up
really well so shout out to that pretty
tree by honest Alvia highlight brush
number 23 is downstairs so I'm going to
take this one from Target I got in a
little set and we're just going to
highlight very pretty drugstore
highlighter so now we're going to put
some wire on our waterline and I am
using again a flower beauty long wear
eyeliner this is in the shade and all
and she's emerald above black not a ton
of color payoff but it's not awful now
we're going in to this heart can beat
velvet mousse matte lip color this one
is in the shade daffodil I also got the
darker nude which is Buttercup that's
what they look like with us the
packaging of these is just to die for
I love it I love it they do stuff like
this so you can reuse it for something
else you also have a mirror in here if
you do want to touch up your lips so I'm
going to use daffodil I love it those
flowers too because I love anything like
to do with flowers you know the where
she storm buy flowers every week and
then I got a little expensive so I quit
doing that
they kept dying so quickly even when I
put the food in there so I quit doing
that but I really love flowers this
packaging reminds me so much of the new
makeup geek ones that are out now when I
pulled out the makeup geek from the PR
package
the top is like half this size and the
one thing that I was thinking was like
oh I wish was a little bit bigger this
one is the perfect size perfect size I
love it because it is such a sleek
little tube again this is daffodil well
this smells like cupcake batter I did
not accelerate my lips today so I would
recommend doing that before using this
product because it does cling to any dry
patch or anything like that so far I do
like it - the fact that it's clinging to
everything as you can see that right
there
as you can see it but it's a really
pretty color it smells really good it's
not too overpowering ok guys so that is
it that is the makeup look that I came
up with trying out new drugstore
products I am very impressed I think
everything was really great for the most
part I was really happy with how
everything turned out so let me know
down below what you guys think was the
best products that I tried everybody
liked everything and - a couple of
things which is not bad for this huge
haul that I did see ya thank you guys so
much for watching keep a lookout for a
where test on the flower Beauty BB cream
I will be doing that very soon and thank
you guys again so much for watching and
I will see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
