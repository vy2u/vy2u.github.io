be sharing with you a full face of first
impressions I haven't done one of these
in so long like doing a complete full
face of first impressions the only thing
that it's not a new first impression is
the eyeshadow primer just because I
don't have a new one but everything else
is we have new face primers foundations
concealers eyeshadow bronzer highlight
everything is new very excited to share
this video with you guys and to try
these products out if you like these
kinds of videos don't forget to give it
a thumbs up and also make sure you hit
that subscribe button for you leave so
you don't miss out on any of my videos
and yeah let's just go ahead and get
started so I'm actually gonna be taking
the city mini palette this is the collab
with Shayla and I'm going to be using
this on my eyes today cuz some nice
structural shadows on she has some matte
shades in here which is really nice so
what I look for in a palette I need a
mixture of mattes and shimmers so this
is what the pout looks like so far the
shade or the shade so far the looks that
I've seen have been really pretty with
this one and I'm gonna take this light
cream shade and I'm gonna set my eyes
with this it's an ice cream shade
there's gonna do something kind of
simple nothing too intense hopefully
every time I say that we end up doing
something different so there are the
swatches right there very very pretty I
think I'm gonna go in that one was
pretty intense I'm gonna go in with a
bronzer first this is new as well this
is the essence Sun Club matte bronzing
powder this is for darker skin this is
like not actually for darker skin this
is for like medium skin even light
because it's really not that dark I'm
gonna use this at the a transition shade
on my eye ooh house like a smells just
like that Physicians Formula bronzer is
that like coconut smell I just wanted
something a little bit lighter and the
crease as a transition now I'm going to
use this shade into the crease you just
got a treat what you do you have it a
puffing about you use this in the outer
be and take it in like so
I'm just throwing this in the crease and
the RV okay there's that very very
pigmented again I am going to take
another brush I think I'm gonna use this
Real Techniques what is this base
eyeshadow brush I'm go back in with that
bronzer and just blend out the edges
really quick so I'm just gonna kind of
just use this out that brush isn't
working for me there we go
all right next up I'm going to use this
really pretty purple shade in the middle
to the outer half so I'm just going to
use this flat brush by Mac it's the Mac
238 just to grab that color it's so
pigmented and put that on the lid super
pretty
in the crease a little bit last yeah I'm
gonna take his really pretty shimmery
gold it's just so pretty and I'm gonna
put that in the inner part of the eye
really pretty colors in this palette I
like it so far it's a really nice
drugstore palette then next up I'm going
to try something from ELF
it's easy this is the intense ink
eyeliner it's in blackest black I've
been wanting to try this
I actually was in New York City with elf
and two other influencers and we were
swatching this and I was like where has
this been because it looks really good
so I'm very excited to try this on my
eyes a little chubby marker like so and
it has a really I don't know why I'm
sure neither a really long felt tip I
love felt tip do you already know damn
y'all see how black that is that was
super easy and this is such a black
liner Wow very nice and it went over
that shimmery eyeshadow so well so easy
to get a wing if you're experienced with
felt-tip liners and that's how you
always do your winged liner I think
you'll really like this one because it's
just so easy to go in and flick it out I
like this a lot this is an a-plus-plus
in my book obsessed with that so I'm
actually gonna go off camera real quick
a finish up my eyes by just putting on
some false lashes and then we back will
do the face brows all of that and test
out so many products so I will be right
back okay so we're gonna move on to a
new primers that I have to try for you
guys some of this stuff in this video is
not brand new but it's new to me so
that's why I figured I would put it in
this video cuz it's been in my drawers
and I feel like it's time for me to get
through these products this is the Marc
Jacobs invisible undercover perfecting a
coconut face primer I feel like I've
heard a couple people talk about this I
do love the bronzer that they have for
this coconut line but I haven't tried
this primer so it just looks like this
kind of looks like sunscreen in a way it
smells like coconut I'm gonna just put
this all over my skin I will say I
thought this is gonna be more of a like
watery consistency this is definitely
different than when I first expected but
I kinda like it it's giving a really
glowy finish I know this is not supposed
to be mattifying or anything like that
but it still wanted to try it and then I
also have this coqui soft matte matte
buying foundation primer remember when I
did that wait did I upload that cookie
video I don't think I ever uploaded the
Cokie video but I bought a bunch of Kogi
stuff and tried it out
why didn't I upload it I can't remember
this is like lavender kind of feel like
it does my skin is feeling very very
smooth okay and then we're trying an
expensive foundation today this isn't my
cart for quite a few days before I could
finally say try it for the tube and this
is the Tom Ford waterproof foundation
concealer I have the shade sable no idea
if this is gonna match me but we will
see let's actually look up some claims
on this bad boy
$85 cheese 3 reviews 5 stars its online
only and then you have 2 4 6 8 10 12 so
not very many shades just 12 says it's
good for sensitive normal dry combo oily
skin it has a radiant finish full
coverage and it basically says it's a
full coverage waterproof foundation that
also functions as an effective concealer
to hide noticeable in for imperfections
so what I would use extra concealer for
is definitely my rosacea we'll see if it
covers it up really well and it says
this foundation can also help minimize
the appearance of tattoos and port
stains but it says it's also a
comfortable breathable foundation with a
naturally radiant finish an effective
concealer that hides imperfections from
darkness under the eyes to blemishes on
the skin at this hybrid formula
withstand harsh weather conditions such
as heat humidity and water while
maintaining an even complexion okay so
I'm gonna kind of use this underneath my
eyes to see if it works as a concealer
and then I'll just highlight underneath
there so again I got the shades stable
if it doesn't match me right now so just
self tan then please forgive me okay so
it is one ounce I think for $85 you
could do a little bit better with the
packaging like the why is the one that I
just tried that I love it's a frosted
glass with a beautiful pump and it's
just a stunning package this is just a
squeezy tube oh yeah this is super light
we're just we're gonna have to work with
it okay it looks like it's oxidized on
my skin a little bit darker but I'm
gonna just include a little bit of this
NYX Pro Foundation mixer these
foundation mixers do not alter to finish
or anything like that just simply makes
the foundation darker if you're curious
NYX does have some I have the more
and I have an olive one okay so I either
use the Cosmetics heavenly lux brush or
a few other brushes like it or the
L'Oreal sponge either by far my two
favorite products to blend out
foundation so I'm gonna first use this
at cosmetics heavenly brush and I'm
going to alright Foundation mixer coming
in hot putting a light layer on first
I'm also going right underneath my lower
lash line since it is a concealer as
well that's what it states on the
package or on the website
it's actually looks pretty decent on the
skin but it's not full coverage it's not
covering up this redness right here that
you guys can probably see my forehead
looks really nice I mean I don't have
too much problem area out there but you
can see right here there's redness
peeking through so I'm gonna see if we
can build it up with a brush kind of
just pounce it again going right
underneath the eyes because this is a
concealer as well these poor little ears
are just never gonna be the same color
as me that doesn't look bad I do
low-key feel like it's oxidizing I do
feel like it's oxidizing do you guys see
that
am I crazy I feel like it oxidized a
little bit so we're gonna go in with a
sponge now I'm try it on the other side
see if we get more coverage on the first
go around so funny to see like my skin
go from super light I'm gonna just go in
the middle here at the sponge just to
blend the two sides together
okay I feel like the two sides look very
similar yeah I feel like I feel like
this is oxidizing a bit like we're
getting a real tan here one thing I will
say it doesn't feel heavy on the skin
like I feel like it feels lightweight
doesn't feel like I have a lot of
foundation on but it is full coverage I
do feel like you need to build it up
though to get that complete full
coverage finish which some people might
enjoy that I think if you don't have I
need a self tan this handsome more I
think if you have a pretty even skin
tone and all you want to do is kind of
even out the color you would be fine
with just one layer but I definitely
think you need to build in areas where
you need extra coverage as for a
concealer I used it on this side I don't
really like it I mean I still see some
darkness peeking through I'm gonna be
the first to say I'm not a big fan of
using foundation as my concealer as well
I'm going to just use a different
concealer but I'm gonna see how this
wears throughout the day
right now it's drying down to like a
nice soft matte finish like it's not
super matte it doesn't feel like it's
tightening on the skin but damn dark so
this is the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
concealer I have the shade
I have classic ivory but I also have a
darker one as well which I'll probably
need which is natural beige so they're
two like super different colors so I'm
gonna take classic ivory Wow
it's stinging my eye can you see it
watering holy crap wow that just made my
eye water so freakin bad whoo that stung
put a little bit of this one on top yeah
that's probably my color as birds
oh my god this birds oh my god I don't
think I felt that stinging sensation
with concealer in such a long time this
is not a full coverage concealer it's
definitely more of a medium coverage I
do think it looks fine
just kind of brightens that area I don't
mind it this especially since the
foundation so full coverage but man I
don't know if I could do the other eye
because my eyes still like burning from
that yeah I don't think I want to do the
other eye with that that burned so bad
the coverage and stuff is fine let me
know if you guys have experienced
stinging with this because wow that was
something else that was something else
okay so now we're gonna set everything
I'm gonna use the Pacifica neutralizing
a mattifier this is a soft focused
translucent powder with cherry and
coconut it's vegan and cruelty free also
for those of you asking I will be doing
a cruelty free makeup tutorial very soon
so just stay tuned you are so pretty
that is so sweet so it just comes in a
compact like this and you open it up
just a little cardboard packaging and
I'm gonna take my favorite brush and
we're in just set everything
we definitely lightened up this
foundation which is kind of a good thing
because she was getting so dark its
oxidizing all me like on camera my neck
looks super dark compared to my face but
I promise you in person I need one of
those like reflectors that shine the
light on my neck as well so you can see
the true color promised you I was going
to use this Physicians Formula insta
ready contour maybe stick but I totally
forgot about it because I just set my
face so we're gonna move on to bronzer
you I saw this one earlier again this is
the essence Sun Club matte bronzing
powder
it says darker skin on it so I'm just
gonna use my brush I've been using
recently for bronzer this is the Soho
brush I think it's like a buffer brush
or something it doesn't have a dime on
it and I'm going to bronze my face with
this one
it's a pretty color I think that looks
really nice I like that color so that's
what this bronzer looks like I think it
looks really pretty I like the shade
it's really nice I am going to contour
with something I don't know what but I
need a contour color I'm going to
contour with this Palladio matte bronzer
in the shade nude beach and I'm going to
just gonna take my Real Techniques brush
whoa Pig meant it the lightest hand with
that holy cow this is pretty warm for
contour so just keep that in mind all
right we're gonna move on we're gonna
move on but that's not bad it's more of
like a red tone bronzer though so just
personal preference on what you like to
contour with if you want more of an ashy
contour I would stick away from this I
couldn't see myself bronzing my whole
face with it but lightly contouring the
cheekbones it's not bad this is in the
shade all you need is pink and we're
just gonna use that with a blush brush
oh just hit the paint
that's cute I'm not normally into pink
blushes but this isn't bad just like a
little little flesh a little flirty
blush you know this is the exciting part
of the day because we have the desi Kati
highlighters and I am so excited I
actually used this on my body yesterday
but not on my face I know I kind of
dabbled into it and it's not a first
impression but I still I just wanted to
use the yesterday on my body so bad and
it is stunning
I got shave Wego and Amira Mae I think I
said that right
and they're cruelty free gluten free top
free and vegan packaging is super super
pretty I'm going to swatch both of them
for you real quick and I like I follow
both of them I really love their videos
and I just think they're great so I
bought these and I bought a few of the
lip products as well these are so
reflective and creamy so there's that
one right there very very pretty and
then this one is Fuego God I think these
are so stinking beautiful so Fuego and
Miren a stunning so I'm gonna use a
Fuego on my face today actually maybe
I'll do one on one side
when you use my Anasazi brush with Fuego
I'm going to highlight with this
it was so pretty and this on your
shoulders if you watched my August hits
and misses is what I had on my body and
I loved it it is so stinking pretty okay
now I'm gonna use this other one which
is more the darker shade on this side of
my face
wow that was intense I love the both of
these I think they're so pretty and
stunning
I think Fuego would be one I would go to
the most just because it's a little bit
lighter okay next up I'm going to do my
brows and I'm actually gonna use this
NYX micro brow pencil I wanted to try
this because I've been using the benefit
one recently and I was like you know
that if I like that one I need to give
this one a shot one more time so I don't
remember exactly how I felt about this I
think I liked it but I figured I would
just give it a shot because it was just
sitting in my drawer waiting to be used
got the shade blonde and it's just a
dual ended pencil let's hope I can do my
brows obviously me and my brows have not
been on the same page lately
it's a very golden blonde color not
quite what I'm used to do still more
like an ashy blonde I'm not sure I'm a
fan of the color of this one I think the
pencil is okay but this color is just
too golden so this is just not gonna
work for me instead I'll just use my
benefit one and number two okay so there
is the brows done of course not perfect
but I try okay so we're just gonna move
on from brows because I'll be here all
day if I tried to like perfective then
I'm gonna take the highlighter Fuego
again and I'm just gonna highlight
underneath my brows
now I'm gonna finish up my eyes with
this city mini palette I'm gonna go in
with this shader right here now use the
lower lashes kind of smudge that out
then take a pencil brush and use that
same bronzer we used earlier and just
blend that out
so I'm gonna wait for this little
mascara to dry so in the meantime I am
going to use some of these lip products
I did get a hot fire I mean obviously I
had to get hot fire it's just so pretty
so this is the dose of colors liquid
lipstick with them the prettiest
packaging ever it's the first time I'm
seeing and it looks so gorgeous like
seeing it and touching it for myself so
nice and it's just a really fire oranjee
red color oh I also have the gloss and
over the top because I've been loving
like sparkly glosses and this just looks
so gorgeous that's what it looks like I
love these kind of glosses because you
compare them with anything I did get the
two new lipsticks more creamer please
and no shade so this one is no shade so
there's no shade right there gorgeous
and then this one is more creamer please
there's more creamer please I'm going to
quickly line my lips with Mac swirl then
I'm gonna use the color and no shade
take a little bit of Mack swirl here the
outer half
get a little ombre effect then I'm gonna
top it with the over-the-top gloss which
is that really pretty shimmery gloss
okay guys so that is the completed look
I really like a lot of the things that I
use today I love this lip combo this is
just your gorgeous nude gloss lip I love
it love the highlight I think the
eyeshadow is really pretty as well a lot
of products in here I really did enjoy I
think I showed you guys you know the
ones that I want wasn't really impressed
with their like colors I didn't work for
me I actually like this foundation so
far I don't love it as much as my wife
sell one but I'm gonna keep trying it
out and let you guys know what I think
and how it lasts so I hope you guys
