be doing a full face using Amazon makeup
some of this stuff is like dupes for
high-end some of it is just random stuff
that I found on Amazon before ever to
get all this in but I finally got it we
have a full face and I'm super excited
to test all this out and let you guys
know what I think so we're just gonna go
ahead and jump into it if you like this
video definitely let me know down below
in the comments and don't forget to
subscribe but before you leave and yeah
if you want to see me test out all this
random Amazon makeup then let's just go
ahead and get started okay so you do it
I showed a primer this would be thank me
later
I shadow primer and I think it's by
Elizabeth Mott that's cute okay so it
looks like this kind of looks like the
NYX glitter primer that kind of
packaging it does have that light pink
kind of tint I'll show you the two
eyeshadow palettes that I've got so we
have this one this is the beauty glaze
textured shadows palette and it's the
rose gold edition the guy because it
looked really similar to this huda
beauty palette so you open it up you
still don't have a mirror but the
shadows are super super similar they
definitely don't look as pretty but they
are damn they're like identical if you
can tell the black is gonna be way
better in the huda beauty palette this
one's the dupe this one is the huda
beauty palette so you can see they are
pretty much identical and it's a few
shades that you can tell will probably
be a little bit different and they're
textured shadows in the dupe doesn't
look as glittery and metallic as the
rose gold one but let's just test
burgundy and maneater
oh yeah maneater definitely is more of a
deep burgundy shade this one is kind of
like okay this one's who did this one's
from the palette it's really really a
big difference
I bought this Kylie public forever ago
it's the burgundy palette cuz I really
love the colors in this actually need to
get back into it for fall I bought this
loved it I need the shadows are great I
saw this one online and I was like mmm
those look pretty here's what it looks
like
obviously the kylie palettes more fall
this one looks like more summer because
you have more of that like red orange in
the middle
the dew point on top is definitely more
summery I mean when you
here and you actually look at the shades
they're different they're they're more
orange --red they're not so like fall
and burgundy and like cranberry we'll
just watch and see so this one's from
the dupe palette
this one's from Kylie's palette way
different Kylie's palette dupe palette
still really pretty but very different
let's just do the middle shade because
this is one that is so different it just
blows my mind so this one's the duke
palette this one's the Kylie palette I
don't even think I should call a dupe
palette anymore because they are
completely different tones gonna go in
with crystal right here and we're gonna
set our lid with the shade the next
shade we are going to take is this one
in the shape ron's and we're going to
throw this into our crease as our
transition shade looks pretty pigmented
you definitely need to build it up but
it's a pretty transition shade now I'm
gonna go in with three 500 which is this
one right here take a crease brush so
you take the Mac 217 and go into my
crease with this
the one thing I really loved about the
rose gold palette was the matte shades
so this one has some shades I'm about to
now those kind of just like blend into
nothing okay so now I'm gonna go in
winter the shade I don't to use okay I'm
gonna use let's just go on with burgundy
right here actually no we'll go on with
brick red going on with brick red which
is right here just gonna put this in the
outer V into the crease
okay just pull in those edges with no
product on there see they just blend to
nothing like it's it's not even remotely
close to who does palate product is not
that great because you put it on there
and you go to blend out the edges and it
just goes away
let's try a more dense brush with brick
red and let's see if we can make this
better cuz we're kind of losing all the
shades right here I mean you gotta blend
out the edges and a good shadow stays
put when you blend them out I mean even
that color is just not impressive this
is the color here that's it on my eyes
I'm gonna go in here blend it down a
little bit in the crease
all right I don't like it oh they're all
blending away I don't understand that I
was kind of hoping for like a good color
payoff with this but let's try this
black now I'm just wanting to see if
this will dust away first off that's
like the sorriest black ever I'm gonna
see what happens when I blend it out
like I do every other eyeshadow so
there's the black blended out it's not
bad but it's definitely not my favorite
it just looks like a cheap eyeshadow in
my opinion it's just not it's not
working for me
I mean wet-and-wild has cheaper
eyeshadows but they're better they have
more pigment they don't blend away and
just right now I'm not impressed by this
palette so what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually just gonna go ahead and try to
go in with these shimmer shades I'm
gonna use my mac 242 brush let's just
see what this looks like geez man all
right I'm gonna try use my finger okay a
finger is the way to go with it that's
not too bad but the matte shades are
just not impressive at all I feel like
this palette is just not worth the money
you get so I mean when you go to blend
it out it blends away I don't I don't
get it
I don't get it like that's a very just
blank palette this has got to be a Miss
I am NOT impressed with this at all this
oh it just makes me irritated I would
pass on this if you see it on the
website which I'm pretty sure this is
like a super popular item because it was
popping up all over the place and I was
like okay I'll try it out okay so if you
guys are wondering this was ten dollars
and 38 cents and it has four stars which
I really can I don't understand why this
has four stars it should have like two
so this one's called the burgundy color
palette and it looks completely
different online like the middle shade
at least then it looks in person this
one has four stars again and is 10
dollars and 18 cents so we're gonna test
it out and see how well it works so
really quickly I am gonna go in just
with this
shade and Bey all over my lid this is
from the huda beauty palette but the
philosophy one does not have a nice like
matte shade look at that
the philosophy one does not have like a
nice matte shade to put all over the lid
so we're just gonna throw this one on
alright so we've got that primer set now
we're ready to go
so first shade I'm gonna take is this
one right here and again when I throw it
in the crease this is looking more like
a creamsicle shade on my eye which is
really weird but this is a shade I have
on but on my eye just looks like kind of
creamsicle ish it's weird it looks like
it's like maybe oxidizing in certain
areas like this area looks really yellow
this looks yellow it's a little weird
but we're gonna keep it moving
alright moving on now I'm gonna take
this shade or attea and throw this into
my crease as well mainly like right here
in the outer V and then the crease I
feel like these look different on the
eyes could just be me but they look
lighter than they do in the pan
alright let's just get to the
nitty-gritty let's go into this one whoa
see this one packs some punch
and then you apply it to your eye and
it's just like this is not going how I
planned all right so this is gonna be a
really good video good makeup guys this
is I I hope you can tell it looks so
pigmented when you swatch it and you put
it on your ID it's just again there kind
of blending away and just looking so
bland
alright moving on let's try the darker
shade this one let's see how you work
this one looks pretty it looks pigmented
I mean for some people they probably
won't care but for me that deep shade is
not on my eye and then you blend it and
it's gone
let's try one of the shimmer shades okay
so I'll go in with this one this one
looks real pretty having to really dig
my brush in here
they're $10 but you could get better
eyeshadows for $10 look apply it with
your finger that looks way better
oh the shimmer is okay it's not my
favorite definitely I recommend using it
with your finger but I'm just so I mean
the whole palette is just like I know
for me personally I would pass on this
one - it's just not pretty on the eyes
it's not like it's not enjoyable to work
with I think for $10 you can get
something way better
I hate being negative but damn that was
not impressive I mean two pallets that
both didn't work very well so now I'm
gonna go in with this primer this is the
pore minimizing a foundation primer and
it is oil free says it's suitable for
all skin types use daily to brighten and
improve the overall appearance of scam
while minimizing large pores fine lines
and imperfections where it's on where on
its own or under your foundation for a
long lasting a flawless finish this
packaging is really pretty it's just a
really classic sleek black bottle and
then that's what it looks like kind of
like a sunscreen no I'm not really
sunscreen it looks like a gel like a gel
moisturizer with a little bit of
sunscreen doesn't smell like anything
like literally nothing it smells like
nothing it's getting a little tacky it's
definitely drying down whoa it's drying
down that was quick oh no okay so I put
that primer on and it really feels super
good it's very very lightweight again
there was not a fragrance for anything
so this is not new but I wanted to use
it for this video
it's the derma Col film studio makeup
cover foundation this is a really
intense full coverage foundation I tried
this so long ago but I haven't really
been using it mainly because I don't
have my shade I guys went in the color
223 and we're just gonna apply this to
our skin you take the top off there's
little piercing thing right here you
just go Boop pierce it and then you're
good oh now this one's too dark
I can't wait with this foundation
maybe you actually not bad I barely had
anything on my brush Wow
okay this color is actually good I
barely had anything like I just went to
tap it a little bit you do not need a
lot of this foundation it is so full
coverage long wearing for some reason
I'm getting patchy up here I think I got
a little too excited too quickly because
now I'm getting patchy see if we could
just press it in now we're gonna move on
to this concealer palette it comes with
a little brush so we're gonna use that
today it's a 15 natural concealer tones
and it's just like a little concealer
palette if you're gonna try it out this
is a very lightweight palette because
it's so cheap this flimsy ass
what is this we're just gonna go in I'm
gonna take a mixture of these lighter
shades probably this one these two right
here use the brush for the first go
around
guess he's looking a little pink so
let's go in with some warmer tones I
don't really like this brush because
it's swiping away my foundation and
everything my god this damn video is
going south the concealer doesn't look
bad but I'm not getting a lot of
coverage so I'm gonna go in with this
Smashbox buildable concealer brush I'm
just gonna take it my brush and we're
just gonna apply it and then blend it
out with the foundation brush again I
mean it doesn't look bad but I need a
close-up mirror nobody has a mirror it
just looks really dry you see in here oh
gosh is rough
I mean you still see some darkness in
here that it's not covering this eye
looks way better but it's definitely
like a creamy concealer like something
where if you're oily I would say stay
away from it if you're dry then you
could try it out if you like more of a
medium coverage concealer um yeah not my
favorite so now we're going in with this
stock up buttercup setting powder and
this is in a buttercup light this is
just like a yellow toned powder so this
is what it looks like I'm just gonna
open it up it's a really huge jar this
is filled to the top I feel like it's
very rare for people to fill up the
powders as much so I appreciate that so
it's super yellow I'm just gonna go
ahead and set my face I'm gonna use a
big powder brush
I'm not baking with it I'm just gonna
take it to go in or not underneath my
eyes okay okay now the concealer really
doesn't look that bad thinks it's so
creamy it was really really accentuating
my pores and my texture I mean there's
still so much darkness showing through
so if you don't really need a lot of
coverage you might like it but for me I
like a full coverage finish so I
wouldn't use it
I like this powder so again that's the
Sasha Buttercup setting powder good
stuff go into bronzer i'm using the
whatup beaches matte bronzer it just
looks like this i love the name of it
then here's the color that color looks
good looks good contour alright so I'm
gonna use my
Euler bronzer brush which this is from
Soho see how this looks as a bronzer it
looks a little cool tone to be a bronzer
but dude that looks so good it is more
cool tone which normally I like to
contour with but it doesn't look
terrible shows it leaves out now that I
have it contoured I think I would just
use this specifically for contouring not
for putting it on the cheeks because now
I'm just looking kind of gray a really
nice powder if you like more cool toned
bronzers this one is the way to go
not bad at all so again this is the
whatup beaches it has a mirror I proved
that one but onto the thing I'm most
excited about is the color blusher 5
color effect blush container I don't
know what you would call this uh-huh
basically it's 5 blushes stacked on one
how cool is that
so you have this color vibrant vibrant
you have more of an orange tone more of
a like kind of Dali pink color and then
you have this really great kind of mom
nude shade so you have all five of these
of course I'm gonna go with this one
right here and when I apply this to my
cheeks its pigmented Wow it's pigmented
this isn't this isn't terrible think if
you want 5 blushes in one product if you
want to use it for traveling who do that
with this and all the blushes are matte
so I like that I think this is not bad
now we're gonna go in with this
highlight trio from City color I don't
know if this is drugstore brand or not
but I saw this and I've never tried
anything from the brand before so it's
just a little tiny very tiny highlighter
palette you guys know I love the flower
Beauty one that's one my favorites right
now but I figured out test this out so
I'm gonna go in with probably these
first two shades right here these my
Smashbox brush alright see what you're
working with here
it's not bad whoo you can build it up
you can for sure build it up okay so
this is the gold one and it's not
showing up super gold more like a
champagne color you could have a really
intense highlight or you could tone it
down and blend it out I don't think it
is better than the flower beauty one but
dang alright next up I'm going to be
trying this deep-sea automatic diamond
eyebrow pencil so that's what so it
looks like right there looks promising
says it's waterproof did I get this in
the shade deep or is it called C this
has a crown oo okay this is different so
it kind of looks like the goof proof but
it is thinner as you can see and then
you have a spoolie on the end or the
only thing I'm hoping with this one is
that it doesn't break on me because it
seems pretty thin I just kind of fell in
love the other day with the Loreal brow
pen I just kind of fell in love with the
Loreal brow pencil the other day so
let's see how this looks oh that gives
you a thin tail
definitely is deep for me it's very
creamy kind of has a waxy consistency
definitely I'd have to go with something
lighter and part of the eye okay
wow that is deep this is the shade 0-2 I
mean I knew it wasn't gonna be Burnett
any time soon so I'm surprised it's the
shade that it is I'm gonna use this I
lower brow pencil in the shade belong
just to do the inner part of the brow
see if we can make this work but it's
not bad I mean it fills in the brows
really quickly like I said it has that
consistency so it kind of just lays down
the brow it's just the color is really
often I need to touch up with concealer
but it is more of a thinner product
which I like so now I'm going to use
this felt tip eyeliner pin so here is
the eyeliner pen oh one swipe baby
that's what it looks like one swipe I
have high hopes we will see such a
pointy felt tip liner that it really
just flicks that wing right there it's
not drying down matte which is what I
prefer but it's not terrible like I can
get over that with hell-hole AK this is
and how it makes my liner look next up
we are going to use this waterproof
retractable eyeliner pencil in sharpener
oh and sharpener so there's a sharpener
at the bottom if you want to use that
but let's see what this looks like
okay not bad alright maybe not maybe not
yeah this is not going well this is like
uh this is one of those cases where the
eyeliner is just like too thick and
consistency that it doesn't want to
apply to your eye just poked myself in
the eye I wouldn't use it again but it's
not terrible hey so the mascara I'm
using is this golden collection by
Viviane Sabo or Sabo is the cabaret
artistic Volume Mascara this reminds me
I don't know why but it reminds me of
Willy Wonka the movie and like the
golden ticket and the bar oh oh so it
opens up like this there it is plastic
wand it tells you that on the packaging
there's D package looks kind of
expensive definitely is a plastic wand
it's what it's doing is separating them
but making them look like they're wet if
that makes any sense it's not like
fluffy lashes instead it just looks like
kind of clumpy but separated lashes does
that make any sense I wish I would've
put this liner on it's the weird I think
it's the formula that's doing it so
you're actually your lashes don't look
fluffy like the more you apply the more
it coats the lashes and then separates
them in clumps this is like a mascara
you put on and it looks like you're
wearing false lashes because your lashes
look fake not a good fake but like a
plastic fake that's what these look like
I did buy lashes but honestly these are
so pretty that I don't want to waste
them on this video because I'm about to
just take my makeup off and redo it but
I wanted to share it with you guys
because I think they are so pretty and
well worth it
but how pretty are these lashes you guys
they are so fluttery all right before I
get like too deep into it let me just
see how thick the band is oh yes yes
just imagine that the band is not super
thick at all girl y'all need to stop
what you're doing if you love lashes and
go order these lashes because
that's super pretty okay so lastly we
have is matte lip gloss these are
lasting a hydro matte lip glosses
transparent color to show a thrilling
charming lip makeup so these are the
three light shades in the palette I'm
guessing I'm going to go with this one
they are more matte they are definitely
like a matte gloss like where it's not
super shiny I'm gonna use the shade zero
1 which is silk indulgent I don't know
what is about this packaging but it's
kind of making me like my teeth hurt I
sounds kind of weird but okay they're
super opaque I don't know what that
whole transparent mmm they kind of smell
like you guys smell like a delicious
cookie there's zero one and skit silk
indulgent if I'm gonna take bear with me
and put this on top let's put Lulu on
top I feel like these are drying down to
more of a liquid lip type situation um
at first they were definitely kind of
glossy but now they're really starting
to dry down okay guys so that is it for
this Amazon a full face makeup tutorial
I really hope you guys enjoyed it let me
know what you thought down below in the
comments I think my standout product is
this powder this Buttercup setting
powder the whatup beaches bronzer the
primer was really great for my face also
the highlight trio was really nice as
well hope you guys enjoyed this thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you guys in my next video
