the Dollar Tree Dollar Tree makeup
challenge and I asked you guys a few
days ago what video I should do a lot of
you actually requested this so I figured
hey I'll go test it out so I went to
Dollar Tree and honestly they didn't
have that much stuff like I thought they
were gonna have a little bit more to
choose from um but like I don't have a
concealer because they didn't have
concealers I have one makeup brush in
here
I don't know I hope this goes well that
we'll see but I was surprised that they
had elf like the elf dollar line they
had a couple items from there the first
thing I'm going to use is this sassy in
cheek moisturizing foundation we will up
my sleeves for this but this is in the
shade dark I hope it's not too dark it
looks like a tan color so hopefully it's
not too intense and I'm gonna have to
use my fingers for this cuz I don't have
a foundation brush I'm also going to be
doing a full face one brand makeup
tutorial with elf products I went on bus
and things today so thumbs up if you're
excited to see that video and thumbs up
for challenge videos I've had some of
you asked me to do the kids makeup
challenge but I haven't gotten around
that yet this is what it looks like it
does not look like a dark shade adult
use only hmm
all of this makeup was literally like
ten eleven dollars not expensive at all
is this a thicker foundation and I have
new lights now so you guys can pretty
much see everything wrong with my skin
so yay oh there's that this is not dark
and now just gonna blend it in with my
fingers I haven't done this in so long
like blend with my fingertips wow that's
intense let me rub some that off I feel
like it's not singing into my skin oh my
god this looks so greasy I have another
foundation from LA Colors but like this
is this is this is scary this is scary
thought like moisturizing like okay it's
gonna be a little bit dewy not like
grease face okay let's just go ahead and
try to set this with a powder and
hopefully it looks a little bit better I
feel like it's coming off a little more
shiny on camera than it actually looks
in person I'm going to take this color
mate's press
powder and this is in the shade rose
beige hopefully it comes with a sponge
so it has this piece of foam it's like
not even a sponge and I'm just going to
just going to Pat this on my face that's
right
mattify that foundation is powder saving
the day there wasn't a lot of options to
choose from like legs I don't have a
concealer or anything so that kind of
sucks but um I'm also going to take
powder on my finger and put this on my
lids not a bad powder and it's paraben
free so if you were wondering I'm just
going to go ahead and go in with
eyeshadow and everything I only found
one brush which is this wet and wild
eyes shadow brush just looks like this
and then for ishow I'm gonna use this la
colors 12 color eyeshadow in trendy
these look really pretty so hopefully
they lived on the skin and I'm gonna try
to add one of these shades as like a
contour shade cuz I didn't find any
bronzers we've got this little tool
which I haven't used in so long and then
the eyeshadow brush okay so in this
palette I'm going to take this shade
right here I'm going to put it into my
crease with this wet and wild brush
you
okay now I'm going to go in with this
darker shade right here just going to
kind of go over all of that just a
little bit lower not necessarily
blending Queen over here but you know
get a little bit to work with
I was hoping I would find like one of
those elf dollar blending brushes at the
Dollar Tree but just wasn't it my
favorite now I'm going to take the
little sponge that it came with and I'm
going to go in with the lightest shade
right here and put this all over my lid
that was a terrible help I'm just gonna
put it like right here in the inner part
of the lid and kind of blend it back
okay okay this is not terrible like if I
had my regular brushes we could probably
make this work
wow that is an intense Y eyeshadow and
I'm freaking loving it how much was this
palette a dollar a dollar that is insane
alright we're doing okay going back in
with actually let's take this shade
right here I'm going to blend these
edges
softer okay now I'm gonna go underneath
my brows which Ashley I need to do my
brows I don't have a brush to do my
brows oh no I'm just gonna use the
sponge and this little guy
this is another la colors palette is a
black might as well use some black in
this look right another la colors
palette this is a gray black and white
I'm going to take I'm nervous and
where's what am i doing I'm going to
take the black the sponge and just do a
little bit on the outer I'm going to put
down the outer part of my lashes so I
need to take side
man sponges are hard to work with or
browse if I don't have anything for
brows I'm just going to use a shimmery
eyeshadow because I have nothing else
I'm gonna go in with a shade with the
sponge lord please help me I'm just
going to dust this into my brows man how
did I not get an eyebrow product pretty
sure and see any let's try this one I'll
brush even though it's huge see if we
can make it work a little bit more my
brows look so made oh my girl now I'm
going to go in with that same vanilla
shade we've been using on our eyes in
this palette and put it underneath my
brow
this LA Colors auto liner eyeliner in
black finds eyes with no sharpener
needed it's always a plus i line my
lower waterline and my upper waterline
thanks polka said me now
we're gonna put some mascara on I'm not
going to do like a liquid liner anything
I'm just going to leave the eyeshadow as
is taking the first color we use I'm
dragging that right underneath the outer
part of the eye kind of flicking it out
just add a little bit of smokiness and
definition on the lower lash line then
I'm taking this la colors bold plump
lashes and very black and yeah this is
like the cutest little list it's like
such a little baby
more of a natural lash mascara but it's
really not that bad okay so now we're
going to do a little bit of contouring
probably hopefully this turns out okay
I'm just going to take the first shade
we've been using in this palette I'm
just going to take the wet-and-wild
brush and dust it right in here to blend
up look at that okay it worked but it
worked
nice on I could use the blush brush
and blush palette this is the color
mates blush and brushed and sun kissed
tan oh my god just any better brushes
that's all okay moving on I'm gonna
highlight I'm actually going to use the
shade that I used on my eyes is my
highlight because why not right I'm
gonna mix these two actually use that
terrible blush brush
I mean it's highlighted it's highlighted
we just don't have any blending brushes
and the last thing I have is this LA
Colors moisturizing lip gloss in tickled
pink so I'm just gonna open this this is
a glittery lip gloss
hey kind of goes with the metallic lip
trend doesn't it okay guys so that is it
for my Dollar Tree of makeup tutorial it
didn't turn out as bad as I thought it
would um using the tools was definitely
the hardest part I feel like if I were
to have my regular blending brushes and
just regular liner brushes it would have
been a little bit better and of course I
didn't have any brow products so but I
think one thing we have discovered is
that this LA Colors eyeshadow palette is
actually not terrible it's pretty dang
good especially that light shadow in
here and it's a dollar it's a dollar you
guys I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video I definitely enjoyed filming it

more challenges down below in the
comments and don't forget to give this

makeup and yeah thank you guys so much
