to be doing a full face using only
Maybelline product I wanted to do this
because I had quite a few things that
were new from Maybelline and I wanted to
share them with you and we're going to
try out some new things together so I
hope you are excited about this video if
you like this idea I want me to do more
let me know what brands down below you
want to see and don't forget to give
this video thumbs up it's kind of like a
first impressions slash favorite slash
maybe misses we'll just have to see hope
you enjoyed this video don't forget to
subscribe before you leave and if you
want to see a full face using only
Maybelline products and let's just go
ahead and get started okay so the first
thing we're going to do is prime I have
this Maybelline prime and smooth base
this is a long lasting eyeshadow base
and this one is in a skin tone shade so
that's what it looks like right there I
guess this is the shade for 10 I'm never
trying to make me an eye primer so we'll
see how this works
today I do want to try the LA girl
primer and also I think it's the wet and
wild primer you guys have recommended
those to me because they're good for
oily eyelids so I will definitely check
them out and let you guys know what I
think seems like it has a very creamy
texture not feeling too awesome for oily
eyelids so we will just see we're going
to set this with a powder the eyeshadow
palette I'm going to use does not have a
matte shade in it so I guess I'm just
going to dig into this Maybelline fit me
loose powder this is new from them about
the shade 15 light this comes with like
a lot of product you guys like it's not
all packaging that is a ton of product
this is a shade of a light it's a little
bit darker than what I expected
I'm glad I got this shade instead of a
medium I'm just going to set my whole
lid now moving on I show I will say I'm
not the biggest fan of Maybelline
eyeshadows I just never have found one
that I'm obsessed with I usually don't
like the formula but I've been hearing a
lot of things about this this is the
newest city mini palette and this one's
in the shade rooftop bronzes and I have
tried this once and I was not that
impressed by it it's all shimmery shades
there's no math in here which I'm not
the biggest fan
and when I tried to put like this shade
in my crease it just looks a little off
so I'm going to try to get one more time
for you guys and we'll just see how it
looks on camera as well so I'm going to
go in with a fluffy brush and take this
shade right here and I'm going to blend
this into my crease
when I first I ordered all this stuff
online so when I saw this online I
thought that the crease shade the one
that I'm using now with a matte shade
and it's not I would say they're all
either shimmery or they have a really
intense shade but there's no max which
I'm on that kind of girl I love my matte
shadows so as a little disappointed but
we will see how I like this palette
again but if you guys are liking the new
lens because we're zoomed in Eleni
wanted me to zoom in so I hope you're
excited this is so much easier for me
it's great quality so pretty excited
about that I just don't like the sheen
all over the crease you know what I mean
but that's like the only shade I could
put in the crease so we're just about to
roll in it I'm going to take a blending
brush I'm going to go in with the shade
right here again this is a shimmery
Brown it is pretty pigmented I'm just I
mean they're pigmented don't get me
wrong I just need a anything Mac I wish
they would have thrown like to mess into
this palette you can use other eyeshadow
palettes with this if you wanted to but
I like a one-stop shop pout you know
what I mean
a little bit of a deeper color just so
this right here in the very outer V like
that to really deepen this up so those
does it easy look all that easy lips
turn out to be a little bit milky I
don't know how that happens though it
does and then I'm going to take that
same first shade that we used right here
and I'm going to use another blending
brush something a little bit smaller
than the first rush we used and this
will just give us a more precise
application I'm just going to blend out
the edges of these shadows
these aren't terrible these are way
better than our other palettes pigment
wise now I'm going to go in with this
shade right here I'm going to put this
in the inner corner and blend it to the
other shade
this one looks way better on the lids
and the other one I used I used this one
all over my lid last time they just did
not look that great all my eyes this
one's way better one more time I'm going
to take just a little bit of the really
dark shade that's in here with a smaller
blending brush and this is right matter
B should really fluff that in there I
hope it isn't going a little bit better
than the first time I ever tried these
eyeshadows but I'm still just not blown
away there's other eyeshadow palettes in
the drugstore that I really love so that
any eyeshadow palette again it is the
city city city mini palette in the shade
or top bronzes then next up we're going
to go in with the aligned stiletto liner
from Maybelline as well as what looks
like this is like a really well-known
liner and I wanted to try this out for
this video so I'm just going to line my
upper lash line
it is very pigmented so it's going to
like that I'm not going to do a wing
today so that is the liner it does look
like it's drying down maps which is good
in my opinion now I'm going to go in and
curl my lashes and then I'm going in
with one of my favorite mascaras
actually no this is not the one that I
loved
oh whatever so I haven't tried this one
actually because I'm remembering I think
this is the one that Manny and Shayla
had a commercial with yeah I haven't
tried this one that was a lot I'm sorry
I thought this was a different mascara
from them which I need to remember what
it is I'm pretty sure it's in like a
gold or yellow too but we're trying to
sell for the first time is a colossal
big shot like I said earlier I do like
the packaging I think it's really pretty
it's kind of like a bullet which is so
cool I'm sure that's probably not the
look that they were going for but I like
it and then this is what the wand looks
like looks promising so let's see
I will say it's not my favorite I feel
like it's not adding as much volume as I
like and it's not really listing even
though I curl my lashes still not really
lifting them up that's what the mascara
look like really simple did purchase
this mascara from L'Oreal which I'm
super excited to try the lash paradise
so I will let you guys know what I think
of it there is nothing but great things
about this okay so I will apply false
lashes in a little bit we're going to go
ahead move on face so I'm going to use
the Maybelline master prime face studio
primer this is a blur and smooth we're
going to see how the skills I have a
feeling it's gonna be like a silicone
primer I don't think I've tried these
primers like a cream that really
surprised me that it's a blur and smooth
primer but it came out in a cream form
let's like it by five really well and
did go over my pores nicely so I am
still painting right now and like my tan
is developing I just fit on four started
filming but it has been maybelline dream
mousse liquid and I also have the matte
and poreless thinking this shade might
be best even though it looks a little
dark right now for myself tan develops
I'm going to be super dark if you don't
know I used a loving pan self-tanner and
it is amazing so good I love ultra dark
I use dark other day didn't like it
ultra dark is my favorite cuz it makes
me so dark and literally everybody
thinks I just came back from the beach
when I use that product yeah I think I'm
gonna go with this one so this is the
enabling of matte and poreless in soft
hands now I'm going to use it with a
brush and also with a sponge we'll see
what works better quite a bit darker but
we'll just blend it down the neck this
has really good coverage a lot of you
know I love love love the dream matte
moon from Maybelline it's like one of my
favorite one so I had to get the liquid
one but there are great things about it
as well but I just wanted to really try
this one out today the matte and
poreless so that's one side with a brush
and I actually really like it
I've missed you know I'm normally like a
Beauty Blender kind of girl
I like my lore'l sponge but I really
love to use the most looks really nice
it has really great coverage as you can
see here I kind of like both ways I
don't really think I have a preference
to which one I like better I think it
looks really good on both sides this is
what it looks like I think it looks
really nice I kind of liked it so far
and it's starting to dry down to like a
soft finish so many is two different
kinds of concealers from the middle lane
we have a full coverage one which is
this one the master conceal this one's
the face Studio camouflaging concealer
and then more of a medium coverage
concealer so I'm going to take this one
I'm just going to put the camouflage one
right here to cover up all that darkness
and down the center of my nose now I'm
going to take the fit me which is one of
my favorite concealers and I'm just
going to put this the rest of my face
and this will also help lighten up the
foundation help us match a little bit
more and then again I'm going to use
this L'Oreal sponge to blend it all out
so I'm just bouncing it back and forth
to really blend it out and dragging it
down here as well I'm going to take the
fit me loose powder and like I'm just
going to set and raise my eyes hopefully
this doesn't look too dark
okay it's like the same color definitely
making the under eyes darker like super
dark actually now that I'm looking at it
all right don't know if I must and as
that mean for the rest of my face yes my
under eyes maybe not I kind of felt like
I should use this powder but I didn't
but I kind of regret it
this is really good at the Maybelline
master fake siphay studio I think this
color would be great for all over the
face but this is good to set your under
eye with so I am just going to take this
with a smaller brush and dust this
underneath my lower lash line just see
if we can lighten it up make it look a
little bit brighter taking a pointy
brush and really just going to dust this
in there
this is like a super fine powder I will
see it it probably causes flashback in a
photography I have not tried that out
yet
but it does look really great in person
it just looks super poreless you can see
I mean it's like a great soft focused
finish oh no I think this for the outer
parts of the states like I'm going to
take this two-faced brush and just take
that light powder and just dust it on
the outer half but I think for
underneath the eyes at least for me I
mean this is a pretty tan color so if
you're fair the light is not going to
work for you are we move on to bronzer I
found this off of Amazon Seamaster
studio bronze bronze and highlight kit
this looks so good I'm very excited to
test this out so you have four shades
you have a highlight shade and then this
contour shade I'm guessing and then some
more bronzer shades so I'm just going to
put my fingers in here that's what it
looks like this one's not very pigmented
all this one looks pretty orange I guess
I'm going to contour this one and this
highlight shade does look okay so I am
going to use a BH Cosmetics brush I'm
going to go in with this shade right
here very lightly I'm just going to
contour with it that's a pretty contour
oh I like that now I'm staying away from
like doing bronzer all over because I'm
pretty tan right now but it definitely
wanted to contour a little bit okay so
that is the bronzer done I like that
darker shade a lot I mean this one might
show up really nicely on my skin as a
bronzer if I'm a little more fair but
does have shimmer in it so just be
warned this looks like more of a sheen
as well I don't think I'll ever use this
color the highlight looks really nice
we'll see you do that today today I'm
going to go on with blush so I want to
share with you guys this kit because I
do love this master Bolin it's a color
and highlight kit I love this one I
think the colors in here are beautiful I
don't really use this very much but
these two colors are great and I love
this highlight shade but I want to try
the new fit me blush and this one is in
the shade nude so that's what it looks
like right there a little light we're
going to see how this on the face
I don't say anything do you think I'll
say anything so if I run into my
favorite palette so I just mix these two
these do blend out so well and then you
just get a really pretty flush to your
cheek normally I'm not into hot paint
blushes I used to be such a huge pink
saloon fan by Mac but then I kind of got
off that gravy train but I really do
like this color because you guys one of
my favorite highlights right now for
Maybelline so I love the one eye in this
kit but also really like this master
chrome it's really nice take my brush
and we're just going to highlight with
this I think this looks great with the
kind of bronze look we have going forth
today I'm going to use this Maybelline
brow for advice a pencil or your brows I
got to show you blonde and if you're
don't try I'm not normally the biggest
fan of Highfill but they didn't have a
palmate I don't think Maybelline has
ever came out with a pomade
well I think I don't like about pencils
I can never get them to look smooth
so that's my only struggle right now so
that's one brow done now I'm going to
try do the other brow with two pencil
sisters not twins sisters on two so
we're going to move on I'm going to
apply this pencil liner this is the
maybelline lasting drama waterproof gel
eye pencil so that's what that looks
like this has been smooth charcoal I'm
going to get last what kinda like the
charcoal it's not to mention I'm going
to use the base of Maybelline a
precision lip liner in and number 20 so
it's just a really pretty nude and then
I'm going to be using this vivid liquid
matte lip and then when I talk it with
color jolts because I'm excessive like
that so I'm going to use this vivid
matte liquid lip and shade nude flush
and then I am going to apply the color
jolt which I love these are made these
are so nice this is in the shade
stripped down ooh pretty color combo
loving it loving it
so this lip is all a Maybelline makeup
like I said I'm not the biggest fan of
the eyeshadow just not my favorite but
everything else I don't mind my eyebrows
I am going to put a brow gel on top that
will lighten them up and make them look
a little bit more natural
I don't mind me liner this little cold
one it's really nice so far I don't mind
the little liner I love the lip combo
foundation and the concealer looks great
the powders look great along the way you
kind of smell like whatever change and
when I wouldn't use again definitely
feel like I need some false lashes and a
lighter brown gel so I'm going to
quickly apply that and I'll be back to
wrap up this video for you guys so - -
let me show you it looks like but so far
I'm doing a little okay guys so this is
the final look I think lashes really
helped complete this makeup look it just
looks a little bit more glam I do kind
of like the bronze the eye and then just
kind of more of a simple face with a
little bit of a flush in a nude lip I
think it looks really nice if you watch
the whole video you know some things
that I like and things that I would have
changed but for the most part I do like
the way the whole makeup looks turned
out and I think especially the face
makeup is a my favorite so far I'm
excited to keep using this foundation
thank you it's so much for watching and
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
