be doing a full face using only a
sally's beauty makeup I have quite a bit
stuff here we have things from Pilate Oh
obviously I also have things from the
what's-it-called femme couture line and
then I also have some items from ardell
as well so I'm really excited to test
these out and let you guys know what I
think I haven't tried these until I
shout in pellets so I'm interested to
see how well they perform as well as all
this other stuff that I picked up so if
you guys are interested then definitely
keep watching and forget to give it a
thumbs up if you liked it and hit that
post notification bell after you
subscribe so you don't miss out on any
of my videos so if you want to see me
put on a full face for makeup you can
buy it at Sally's Beauty then let's just
go ahead and get started okay so I'm
gonna first start out with these Ardell
eyeshadow palettes this is the pro
eyeshadow palette mekt and then I also
got via shimmer one just in case I was
feeling fancy these were these are 1519
each which I feel like is pretty pricey
and this is what they look like so you
get 15 matte shades in here and this
green is looking so so pretty and then
the same for the shimmer palette is well
standard neutral shades so we're gonna
go into the matte one first also if
you're wondering I got my extra large
claw clip that's Ellie's I did not know
they made extra-large versions of this
you guys know I love my Drybar Clips
like this and I saw these and I was like
yeah I need a pic of this so we're gonna
go into the matte palette first looks
like has really pretty colors in here
y'all know I love a good matte eyeshadow
look we might do that today we haven't
done a matte eyeshadow look in a minute
so I'm just gonna take the seal off and
then I'm gonna dip into this color first
and just set my entire lid give a nice
base for all the shadows we're gonna put
all in okay next up I'm gonna take this
shade right here these do not have names
on them just FYI same brush and throw
this into the crease this is looking
pretty decent so far it's a nice
transition shade for me so we're really
just gonna blend and work this out into
that crease next up will show you I want
is I guess I'll go into this shade and
neck
right here and I'm also gonna blend this
into my crease as well I'm just gonna go
below that first shade that we put on
and build this color up just so it
deepens it up a little bit and I'm doing
circular motions here in the outer V I
have so much work today and pictures to
take today that I really need my makeup
to look good there's actually blend
really well I think I'm just gonna do
maybe an all matte look today so what
I'm gonna do is go into this green right
here I'm going to put this more on the
lid and again blend into the crease as
well so I'm gonna take it here in the
outer corner again I'm just kind of
pressing it in and I'm also gonna do
that in the inner corner as well and
then leave the center part open so just
like that I'm gonna go back into this
shade that we used earlier and I'm just
going to touch up that crease and fade
everything out this how it's definitely
getting stuff done but it's very kind of
boring I guess you could say so now I'm
gonna use this Palladio under eyes
disguise a full coverage concealer I'm
gonna use this in the center of my lid
so I can put a lighter shade down and
it'll really pop so I'm never try this
concealer this is new for me we'll see
how this goes this one's in the shade
Kuster I'm just gonna pack a little bit
on my brush just to coat it and then I'm
gonna put this in the center of my lid
oh wow so I'm gonna take it right up
here and down really kind of carve out
that crease then I'm gonna go straight
into that matte palette and I'm gonna
take that first shade that we used here
and I'm gonna put that on top of it just
make that pop
so I'm just gonna kind of pack this on
I'm not liking the way this looks I'm
thinking it's the concealer throwing it
off something just it's just not working
for me I'm gonna take my finger into
this shimmer from the shimmer palette
and I'm just going to lightly press this
in the center of the lid I was trying to
do an all matte look but it's just
looking super dull so I want to amp it
up a little bit and this shimmer shade
is doing that looking much better
actually and then again I'm gonna take
that clean brush and just kind of go on
the outer edges to blend so all in all
they're okay they're not like my
absolute favorite drugstore eyeshadow
palettes but they're doing the job so if
you want to try them out I would say try
them out if they're your type of shade
so they're pretty neutral they have like
your basic colors in here and if that's
something you like then I would say try
it out now what I'm gonna do is apply
the Ardell double-up whispies I really
love these lashes they do have the meta
stylee's so I'm gonna go ahead and apply
mascara put these on and then we'll come
back and move on to face which is my
favorite so I have my lashes on now and
we're gonna move on to face this way I'm
gonna be taking the Pilate out rice
paper mattifying and perfecting primer I
have never tried this before I have
tried the rice powder so I'm really
excited to try this just in a nice
little squeezy tube looks like that so
we're just gonna blend this into our
skin going from the t-zone and working
our way out I definitely use too much
I'm going to be trying out their
foundation as well this is an oil-free
foundation and it says it's botanical
and vitamin infused this is in the shade
honey it might be too dark for me
I'm not asked and as I wasn't ever
Scottish but let's hope it works out
actually it doesn't look bad this is
honey I will say they don't have a lot
of shades in this foundation so that
does suck and we're just going to even
out the skin
it's actually a little lighter than I
thought it would be like compared to my
hand like it's a little lighter I did
use quite a bit of foundation though and
I'm about to use it all up let's put
some concealer on and make me look a
little bit more alive so I'm going to
take that same full coverage concealer
that we had earlier it is a squeezy tube
so I'm just going to squeeze this
underneath my eyes I'm just gonna move
this a little bit I hate leaving stuff
like this let me know if you guys have
tried any of their face products out it
doesn't really cover much I think this
is a very lightweight concealer so I'm
just gonna add a little bit of my own
products to even this out and make it
look a little bit better because I do
have stuff to do today it looks like
it's actually kind of drying down which
is nice but like for me it's just a
little too dark in that inner corner so
I'm just gonna add a little bit of my
own product and blend that out and we're
working we're in business now okay so
now I'm gonna do is take the Pilate oh
rice powder I really do like this
product a lot I think it's great and I'm
gonna go ahead and use my sponge to
apply that all over my face
that's just my preferred way of applying
powder lately I don't know when I
started doing that I guess when I got
this sponge I just started doing that
more big all you have to do is just
start under your eyes and then literally
take the rest and just go on the rest of
your face I have two different bronzers
here I have one from Finn Couture this
is the mineral effects baked bronzer in
the shade tropic touch but then I also
have one of my favorites which is the
patio baked bronzer in Pacific tan so
I'm gonna try this one out first because
I haven't tried it before already no I
like this one
and we'll see how it looks I'm just
gonna bronze and we're gonna take it up
the face
looking a little orange on me it's very
pigmented but it's it's not my color a
little red actually a lot red we're just
gonna hope that blends out and I go back
into the Pilate Oh baked bronzer and
Pacific tan and just bronzed the skin
with this really do like the Pilate Owen
I've been using it for a little while
now and you can get it out of Sally I'm
gonna do the lightest amount of
contouring since we have so much bronzer
on our face right now so I'm gonna take
this poll audio at the definer contour
and highlight palette and I'm gonna take
a mixture of this one and this one
because this is like an ashy kind of
looks almost green and I want to kind of
even that out so it's not so green and
we're just going to but underneath our
cheeks and blend okay now I'm gonna move
on to this femme Couture get rosy powder
blush this is what it looks like it
looks like a little rose this is in the
shade sunset rose so I'm just going to
lightly take my blush brush and just
sweep it on the cheek I don't really
need much more color I actually think
this blush is pretty it just gives the
right amount of rosy tint to your cheeks
it's nothing super crazy like it's not
overly pigmented which I like okay I
don't have a highlighter believe it or
not from Sally's I couldn't find one I'm
gonna use this shimmer eyeshadow pot and
I'm gonna take this color right here and
see if I can highlight my cheekbones
with this I'm just gonna use my regular
brush and we'll just see if this works
yeah
I'm not bad there we go
improvising okay now we have some brow
products to try I think these are from
Pilate oh yes so these are the brow
definers micro pencils and I have medium
and taupe which are the normal shades
that I go for I usually have two
different ones for my brow and these do
have schoolies on the end which are like
a must-have for me so I appreciate that
and it takes the medium brown first this
is actually super pigmented
I'm gonna keep my brows like this no
just the taupe is kind of an odd color
it's kind of got a peachy tint to it
which is very interesting but they're
blending really well like that's a good
brow I'm gonna take this eyeliner from
Pilate oh this is the smoky waterproof
eyeliner I believe this is just a black
pencil liner a retractable liner I
should say
and then I'm going to take my pencil
brush and going to the mat palette and I
want to take this Brown actually I'm
going to take this dark brown and we're
gonna blend this underneath that lower
lash line
this one's in the shade rescue I have
three different shades you have Georgia
rescue and then obsessed so you have
like a lighter peachy color that you can
wear every day
this one's rescue you can also add this
every day especially if you have deeper
skin tones and then obsessed is like a
fun pop of color that I'm obsessed with
it's so pretty
so I'm gonna use rescue today okay guys
so that is rescue on my lips to complete
this look if you guys want to check out
a video of me watching all of my lip
colors and seeing how they apply I will
link that video down below it in a card
