be on this makeup right here I did a
full tutorial for you guys I have this
makeup look on in my Sephora haul and a
ton of you are asking for a tutorial on
that look so you know how to do it for
you this is like one of my favorite
looks that I've done in a while just
because I love how smoky it is and I
love the colors I think they're super
fun and very flattering so I'll show you
guys the palette that I'm using in the
video and I'm feeling extra glam because
I got my new extensions in and they
match my hair perfectly if you guys
don't know I use foxy love's extensions
and look like these match my hair
perfectly it is actually insane so I'll
leave the shade and lengthen everything
that I use down below in the description
box if you are interested so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you do like
it don't forget to give it a thumbs up
and subscribe to my channel there'll be
a link down below in the description box
and yeah I guess I'm gonna quit talking
and let's just get started with the
video okay so the first thing we're
gonna do is to some tape on the outer
corners of our eyes since this is such a
dramatic look and I'm going in with the
NARS narcissist palette and using this
beige shade right here more of a cream
shade and I'm gonna put this all over my
lid just to even it out and apply a nice
base then I'm going in with this color
right here it's a nice mid tone shade
and I'm gonna put this in my crease with
a big fluffy I came at all today with a
big fluffy brush I'm going to put that
into the crease and I'm just going to
build it up to the color I want which is
just a little bit darker than it is when
I first apply it moving on I'm going to
take the black right here you guys this
black is amazing oh my god it blends so
well and I'm taking a small blending
brush and I'm going to do circular
motions and I really focus on keeping
emotions really small circles because it
helps it blend so well and it really
fades it onto the lid beautifully so I'd
like to focus most of the product again
on the outer corner and then I'll just
do smaller circles in towards the middle
of the lid and it just blends really
really well it's just a technique I've
been doing lately
then I'm going to take this color and
the pallet which is a beautiful blue
green and I'm going to put this all over
my lid and take it to that black as well
this is basically the star of the show
like this is why I love this look so
much is for this color right here I
think it's gorgeous and it really makes
brown eyes pop it's stunning
so again just putting that all over the
lid and taking it up to the crease now
I'm going to take that mid-tone shade we
first use and use a clean blending brush
with that color and I'm going to put
that into the crease just to blend out
everything so we don't have any harsh
line
I'm going to take the black once again
and just even have that outer V one more
time again using a small circular motion
then I'm going to take off the tape and
we have a nice sharp line and then I am
going to do a winged liner with this
look so I'm using my makeup forever ink
liner and just winging it out
I'm going to take these velour lashes
and wispy wispy oh my gosh I cannot
think of a name of them right now
I'll leave them down below if you want
to check them out but I'm using the
benefit matte rescue and then my regular
primers to go ahead and get my skin
ready and I know myself tan looks really
bad on my neck we're just not even I go
there I know it's just so bad it's all
exfoliated by now but now I'm going to
take the Marc Jacobs foundation that I
love and everything I'm using in this
video is what I used in that Sephora
haul - the lips I think I did more of a
nude lip and my lips turned out more
pink in this one so I was kind of
confused but everything else is the same
so since my battery was dying and you
guys see me apply concealer a ton of
times I figured I would just show you
the products so I did use the toothpaste
Coco palette to set that concealer after
I blended it out with my Beauty Blender
and then I'm going to bronze my face
with my Mac mineralize skinfinish in it
give me Sun it's so beautiful and warm
and I've been loving applying it with a
duo fiber brush lately just because
they're really soft bronze effect and I
love it then I'm going in with my
addiction and it is the charlotte
tilbury sculpting palette and i'm going
to take skull powder and just contour my
cheeks I do kind of round it up a little
bit at the end now just to really make
my apples pop and then after that I'm
going to contour my nose and then we
will be moving on to blush
and as I'm lending this nose contour I'm
blending it up so I'm blending it
towards like the top of my nose I don't
blend it down and that's just the way I
like to blend it with this duo fiber
brush and it really works for me and
this Mac duo fiber brush is so good you
guys oh my gosh I love it so now I'm
taking the Kat Von D Hansel and Gretel
blush duo and I'm taking the lighter
shade since you do have such dark eyes I
want to be really minimal with the blush
so this is a really great peachy pink
shade and it's not too much so I'm going
to apply that and then highlight with
the other side of the Charlotte Tilbury
palette and this is beautiful you guys
you really got to get this palette like
if you don't mind splurging is so good
so now I'm going to take the cream shade
and highlight underneath my brow some
matte shades so it's not going to
interfere with what we have on our lid
and then I'm going to use my black
eyeliner which is my NARS eyeliner in
via veneto and I'm going to align my
bottom lash line or the waterline and
then I'm going to take this black and
I'm really going to pack this on
underneath my lower lash line I'm using
a small flat brush and I really wanted
to smoke this look out make it very
dramatic so we have quite a bit of black
underneath there and then we're going to
take the blue-green shade that we use
all over our lids and blend this out
just to again go along with the
smokiness
you just want to pop some mascara on the
bottom lashes to kind of bring
everything together and then I'm using
this lip liner for makeup forever I'll
leave all the info of these lip products
down below and I'm going to line my lips
with this and then we're going to take
it this lipstick from Smashbox and put
this on top again this is a little bit
more pink than what I wanted but it
ended up working at the end so I'm going
to take this Molly lip gloss and put
that on top and then it was a little too
pink so I did add a little bit of a nude
lipstick on top which is Mac's blankety
and it kind of muted it out and I liked
it a lot so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching and
don't forget to like it and subscribe
and I will see you all in my next video
