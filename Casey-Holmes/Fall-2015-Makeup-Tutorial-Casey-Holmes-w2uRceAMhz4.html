if you do like it and subscribe to my
channel so you don't miss out on any
videos I hope you guys are enjoying the
Sunday Monday no Sunday Tuesday Thursday
uploads I'm trying my absolutely hardest
to stay on the schedule for you guys
yeah so I'm gonna quit talking now and
let's just get started with the video
okay so the first thing I did is I took
this shade and baby face and I put it
all over my lid just to have a nice base
for the other shadows we're about to put
on and then I'm taking creme brulee I'm
gonna put this into the crease and I'm
just using a fluffy brush to blend it in
and I'm kind of just putting this all
over the place but mainly into the
crease area and this is just gonna help
all the colors fade up towards the brow
next up I'm gonna take frappe and I'm
going to put this in the crease as well
but I'm going to use a more pointed
brush and it's a little fluffy as well
so it's gonna blend it out really nicely
but I'm going to put this right under
creme brulee but still directly into the
crease so we're not gonna go above that
first Shay we did we're gonna keep it
right under it but still blend it out
just as much as we did the first one
then I'm taking this shade right here
which is called cherry cola I absolutely
love this color oh my god it's so pretty
this is a matte shade and we're just
gonna put this all over our lid don't be
worried if yours looks as messy as mine
yeah I was worried too but we end up
lending it out and it looks fine in the
end so so then after you applied that
you just want to take creme brulee with
a more precise brush and blend out the
edge of that cherry cola color into the
crease and we're gonna go back in with
cherry cola but I want to take creme
brulee first just to really blend it out
as much as possible before we went back
in with a darker shade and started
blending it out again because I don't
want our transition shade to kind of
like disappear you know so I'm using the
transition shade to blend it out first
and then we're gonna take cherry cola
and very lightly put this into the
crease as well but do not go above the
creme brulee because then it won't fade
up to the brow as nicely as we would
like and don't worry if it's just taking
forever to blend this took me so long
so should take your time and then I'm
taking this one in what
cold I just I couldn't see what it was
if I'm taking this shade by makeup geek
as well and at first I was gonna put
this in the center of the lid and then I
just felt like it looked too messy so I
decided to put this all over the lid and
leave the outer half darker and I feel
like the darkness underneath really just
helped make this color pop and I ended
up really loving it
then we're going back in with cherry
cola and we're just gonna put this into
the outer V and then what we're gonna do
is apply our liner and lashes and then
we'll apply a little bit more cherry
cola to deepen it up a bit
so as I'm showing you here I'm taking
cherry cola and just deepening up that
outer V just cleaning it up and making
sure that it looks nice and dark and it
doesn't look faded in any way and I like
using a pencil brush for this it just is
really nice and precise and gets it
right in there now I'm taking my
favorite primers and then this coverfx
drops a lot of you asked me if I've
mixed this in with the foundation yet
and I have I prefer this on its own to
be quite honest with you it's just my
favorite way to use it you can mix it
with primer or whatever you want to mix
it with but I just like using it by
itself so yellow right and now I'm going
in with the Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer I've just been using this a
lot lately
and I'm gonna put it underneath my eyes
and blend it out with this Tarte brush
that is just awesome you can use any duo
fiber brush that you have this one's a
little bit more densely packed so it
just blends everything out nicely
okay now we're gonna go on right there
pallet right now which is the Smashbox
shapematters pallet I'm gonna take the
yellow tone to powder and set my on what
I notice that my under eyes and all the
concealer that I just put on with this
powder and then we're gonna move on to
bronzer I'm gonna take this hourglass
radiant bronze light bronzer with a NARS
kabuki brush I'm gonna put this on the
high points of my face so on my forehead
on my cheeks
you know just the bronzing it up a
little bit and I do really like this
kabuki brush if you are wondering it's
really nice next I'm going in with this
shade right here which is the a sheer
tone in these Smashbox palette and I'm
going to contour whether it's a really
easy powder to work with it's nice and
ashy but not too a sheet where it looks
kind of dead you know what I mean it's
the perfect color and it blends out very
easily now I'm taking this Too Faced
blush in baby love and I'm gonna put
this on my cheeks it's just a nice warm
pink color and it goes with pretty much
any look so I knew it was my go-to for
this one and then I'm just gonna blend
out with my duo fiber brush make some
ugly faces just the regular and then I'm
going in with the glow powder in this
palette and highlighting with this as
well this palette is just like one of my
favorite things right now so it's very
hard for me to put it down then I'm
gonna fill in my brows with my Anasazi a
dip brow and then I'm going back into
that glow powder and I'm gonna put this
underneath my brows to highlight so
really gorgeous shade to highlight with
because it's not too light but it gives
a really gorgeous glow underneath that
brow and really lifts it then I'm taking
this NARS eyeliner this is the grain
eyeliner I'm using and if you have brown
eyes you guys you need this color in
your life oh it's so pretty it's just
the perfect green I just love it and I'm
taking this powder it's powder I'm
taking this shadow and enbe by makeup
geek and I'm gonna blend this underneath
my lower lash line so I put that
eyeliner on my waterline and also on my
lower lash line as well so when I went
in with envy I could blend it out really
nicely and the greens together are just
so beautiful and if you have brown eyes
it will make them pop like crazy I love
this eyeliner
so much then I'm gonna go in with this
mascara and do my bottom lashes and then
I'm taking this lip liner and lining my
lips this is just my go-to lip liner for
pretty much any lip color because it's
just a nude and really easy to work with
then I'm taking Mac's world and putting
this on my lips and then you are all
done with this look so I hope you guys
enjoyed it thank you again so much for
watching and I will see you on Sunday
