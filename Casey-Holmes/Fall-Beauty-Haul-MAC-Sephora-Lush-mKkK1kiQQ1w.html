a haul video and I purchased quite a bit
of stuff over the past a couple of weeks
and I figured why not show you because I
love hauls you love hauls and it's just
fun to see what other people buy right
at least I think so
if you're wondering when to my lips just
stay tuned I'm gonna tell you in a
second I want to quickly tell you what I
actually returned to Sephora I returned
four things I can't remember the other
thing I returned but I remember it was
four I'd ever turned the hourglass
ambient lighting powder little palette
that they have out and I personally
didn't like the palette I think that the
shades lift a little ashy on me they
didn't really highlight my skin or
anything like that and I kind of wanted
them for an all-over powder because some
people have said they use it as all of
her powder just gives a pretty glow and
it didn't happen for me so for $60 I was
like if I'm not 100% happy with it I'm
gonna take it back I know I didn't like
it I know a lot of people love those
powders place for me it didn't work out
I also returned the tarte maracuja
creaseless concealer because it was so
thank you guys like it's the biggest
concealer I've ever come across sure I
used I was like yeah this is why I stick
to the mac prolongwear because it's
everything I want and it just doesn't do
me wrong so the Marek juku concealer it
was so thick I literally had to squeeze
the bottle so hard to get the product
out and then to blend it was just like a
mess and it did sink in just in my pores
as well so I didn't really like that so
return that also return it Urban Decay
lipstick and Venom mainly because it was
an exact dupe of rebel and since you
know rebel is cheaper than the Urban
Decay lipsticks I just went ahead and
took that back because I would much
rather purchase rebel anyways I do love
the formula of those Urban Decay
lipsticks but I just didn't want another
color like rebel you know what I'm
saying like I could just go back and get
red well if I wanted it but that's
pretty much my return if you're gonna
tell you guys I don't plan on purchasing
the Urban Decay vice 2 palette because I
don't think I'm get a lot of use out of
it honestly ok so now that the intro is
like 5 minutes
go ahead and get started with the
products that I purchased I'm gonna
start with Mac the first I'll tell you
about what I have on my lips I do have
rebel and I have this lip liner this is
called a night mom and I've heard so
many people talk about it and I just
never purchased it until recently and
I'm so happy I did because I'm obsessed
with it but it's a really deep plum it's
so beautiful I actually wore this lip
the other night to Lenox Mall and I had
so many compliments on it and I was so
excited about it
so I loved it I actually did like an
ombre lip where I do the night month out
in the outer corners and then I do like
the lighter rebel part because rebel is
a lot lighter than this if you want a
video on it let me know it's super easy
to do and I love the combo a rebel in
this I can't wait to try this out with
other lip colors I also got another Mac
224 brush because I love this brush I
actually use it to blend out my contour
on my nose and also use a fried shallot
as well so I figured I'd get another one
because I've used that one brush for
both things and I didn't want to get
like a different colored eyeshadow on my
nose so I just was like I'll get another
one
and then I also got this Mac prep and
prime translucent finishing powder
because a lot of you recommended it to
me I meant to get this a long time ago
but the girl gave me the pressed and I
was like I'm not even gonna worry about
returning news right now so I'm excited
to have the loose I do like the pressed
but this is a lot more fine and it does
actually reduce the look of your fine
lines and your pores so I can't wait to
use a little bit more unless you guys
know what I think of it after I've used
it for a while and then I just had to
repurchase my Mac prep and prime skin or
fine zone treatment because I ran out of
this which I love it when I run out of
products because it shows that I use it
and I don't run out of products a lot so
I just thought it was so cool I don't
know it's kind of weird but I love this
primer I highly recommend it if you have
oily skin okay so now we're going to get
onto Sephora I'm not even gonna lie I
did purchase quite a bit of stuff but I
wanted
this stuff for a while now so I'm going
to show you kind of the boring stuff
first I didn't get another Beauty
Blender which is already being put to
use so that's why it's not in the case
but I always find one especially if I do
like a bigger order and then I also got
another clear sonic brush and you should
replace these every three months and the
one I get is this sensitive skin one and
I really like it I use it every night if
you want to see my skincare routine I
will link that video down below thing I
got was just more tanning mist I then go
back to San Tropez because the last be
deliver on admit that I used actually
broke on the first application of Stella
Tanner like I just split on the side so
I was like I'm so over this so I just
went back to st. Tropez because my
facial pain ones never split in half so
I just you know went back to this they
are a little bit bigger on the hands but
you know what if they don't split that
finally and the last kind of boring
thing is my moisturizer I think of a new
nighttime cream this is a Korres Wild
Rose and vitamin C this is the advanced
brightening sleeping facial and I
haven't used it I've only used it once
that I mean you can't really tell the
difference just from one use so I'm
excited to try this out you will
definitely you guys know if I like it or
not I love trying out new skincare stuff
moving on to the fun stuff which is
makeup I did get three new foundations
I got a another color this is actually a
darker shade and my hourglass immaculate
liquid powder foundation I'm wearing it
today it's in the color beige and the
other one I had was just way too light I
just went ahead and picked this one up
and there should be revealing it maybe
this week or next week but I plan on
doing a review I review very soon since
I do have the correct shade now so I
just got another shade in them and then
I also picked up the NARS sheer matte
foundation which I used to use this back
in the day I just found I never
repurchase it I felt like I've kind of
got caught up with other stuff to try so
I finally went ahead and got it again
like I said it says in the shear man
it's in the color Stromboli sheer matte
is for more oily skin and the sheer glow
is for D people with more dry skin so
the shear mats are in a frosted glass
which just looks like this I will
say that these look a lot lighter in the
tube and they actually are on your skin
the last one I had it was it was a shade
actually darker than this and it looked
really light in the bottle but once I
applied it to my face it was actually a
shade too dark so just be kind of weary
of that especially ordering online I
feel like they look darker and the are
they look lighter in the bottle than
they actually look on your face and they
don't come with a pump I actually just
ordered one off of NARS cosmetics calm
or NARS calm I do feel like you need a
pump with this because the top part is
just so small like you want to make sure
you have a pump so you can get all your
product alright next is another Kat Von
D product this is the Kat Von D lock and
load
make up a setting mist and I've
everything I've tried from Kat Von D
I've really loved so I want to try this
out and it's just a really cute bottle
I'm just deciding to try it out
hopefully it works for me the urban
decay sprays don't really work for me
that well so hopefully I can see a
difference with this if not you know
just return it but I hope I see a
difference because I want to say the
spray that will work for me but it's
hard to find anything because I feel
like none of them do anything for my
skin I did get another honest sake of
brow with this is in brunette I use this
so much I actually twisted up my one
that I've been using for a couple months
now and it's kind of running out so I
decided to just buy a backup so when it
does run out I don't have to go purchase
another one and like I said this is in
brunettes I absolutely love it I've been
using it for a few months now and it's
just amazing and it also purchased this
NARS larger than life long wear eyeliner
in via veneto miss flaemm rotc which is
Ingrid's she actually has talked about
this so much and I always for like a
year now I would go to this site and I
would be like hmm do I want to spend the
money on it no I don't want to spend the
money on it and then finally I just
purchased it because I've gone back and
forth so much with this but I figured
why not try it if she says it's good why
not try it because I always have a
problem with eyeliner smudging and so
does she and she said that this is
amazing and it doesn't smudge so I'm
excited to try this out and see how it
works
hey next I have a blush this is a
Smashbox halo long-wear blush in passion
this is like a warm rosy pink shade and
I do have one in peachy dream that I
really love
I do recommend storing these in the
boxes and your vanity and not tossing
them because once you open this
container and take this little thing off
it's such a mess even when you close it
it's like the product it gets everywhere
so I highly recommend just you know
keeping it in the box in your vanity so
it doesn't get super super messy and
just all over the place but otherwise I
love those blushes they blend really
really well and they last for a really
long time too so this is a product they
purchased because you guys recommended
it to me this is the NARS light
reflecting setting powder in translucent
crystal a lot of you have told me to try
this out I never tried it out because of
the fact that it said light reflecting
and usually light reflecting is not good
if you have oily skin because you really
don't want to accentuate that I haven't
tried it yet and the packaging is so
cute I just love NARS they're so simple
and it's just gorgeous so I will
definitely let you know what I think of
this powder very very very soon because
I'm going to pop it up and probably like
tomorrow well I forgot the foundation I
also got the Kat Von D locket tattoo
foundation in medium 54 I will actually
be doing a first impression on this
product I am so freaking excited to try
this product out because everyone's
talked about it and for the longest time
a few months ago when people were raving
about it I could not get it online
because it was always sold out but
finally I had my hands on it so I cannot
wait to do a first impression on this
you guys
I'm so pumped it says 24-hour we're full
coverage transfer resistant matte finish
my favorite and fragrance free and
oil-free so I'm so excited to try it out
this will definitely be my next first
impression because I'm gonna like wear
it tomorrow
I'm really excited the next two are like
palettes so this one everyone husband or
anything about it is the UH Nastasia
lavish palette this is what it looks
like and just haven't sleeve and you
open it up and you have a nice mirror
and then you have some car that teaches
you some tutorials and you have
your palate with the shadows and then
you have these products in here get
tweezers you need a pencil in dark brown
you get a eyeliner which I thought was a
liquid liner but it's actually a
retractable crayon liner it's in black
and then you get a double-ended brush
which is kind of cheap to me so I
probably won't be using that so this is
a palette is so freakin pretty I'm
obsessed with these colors I saw so many
people raving about these shadows and
literally every time somebody showed
this in a video I was like I need that
in my life like I love these shades they
are so full so pretty I need them in my
life so finally I just purchased it and
I plan on doing a first impression on
this let me know if you want to see that
because I just want to do a first
impression and see how pigmented they
are see how they apply how they wear
throughout the day if you are a blush
fanatic like myself you need this
palette in your life I think I'm gonna
purchase another one for my giveaway I'm
gonna be having because it's so good
it's from its heart and it's called on
the cuff this is like a holiday palette
I'm the only thing I don't like is the
packaging I don't like all this sparkly
stuff it does come with like a bow
bracelet which is actually pretty nice
quality you could wear that if you
wanted to I'm not really embrace that
kind of person but maybe I'll wear it
one day now keep in mind a Tarte blush
like one blush is about $30 from them
they last so long they're so pigmented
they are just super creamy they blend
really well
I love Tarte blushes I do have two of
them they're really really great and I
don't have any of these shades I did
have the Park Avenue princess bronzer
but I actually gave it away to a friend
but this is what the palette looks like
now I was so pumped when I got this
because I did not think that the
individual shades would be as big as
they are and they're about one inch in
width and then they're about two inches
long so that's a great size especially
for a pallet and you get four blushes
and abroad are like I stayed in so the
blushes you get are crave dazzled
darling dull face and Park Avenue
princess I highly recommend this palette
it's perfect especially if you're like
just starting out with makeup you
wouldn't love this they last so long
perfect for traveling this is also
perfect for a Christmas present anyone
who travels a lot or somebody who just
wants to get into makeup they could have
4 different blushes to choose from Ana
bronzer I highly recommend this it's
it's so great now we're going to get on
some lunch first thing I want to say
ocean salt body scrub is not in here
it's actually in the shower I'm gonna
lie I don't think it's worth like the
3040 bucks that you spend on it I don't
notice like a huge difference with them
so I just I would make purchase it again
the first thing I want to show you guys
is a sample this is the dark angel
cleanser for oily skin I got a sample I
didn't want to purchase a full size
because you guys know I have my skincare
routine going on right now that's
working great for me so I don't want to
mess that up
so we also got this for coldness the
dirty spring wash shower gel this is for
men and it's like what is it um don't be
dirty get fresh with this tingling
extremely minty shower gel it's like a
dip in the mountain spring with
spearmint and menthol to make your skin
feel cool in a hot shower yeah it smells
like that too so colt's excited to try
signs also with the ocean salt we got
this lemon flutter
it's a cuticle butter but you can also
use it for rough skin so you could put
this on your hand first work it in and
then put in salt on top and kind of
scrub away and then rinse and you'll
have nice soft hands again it is kind of
pricey just to have soft hands when the
bath and Bodyworks one can do the same
thing for like 16 bucks but I mean we
want to try it I specifically wanted to
try it for my feet but sometimes in the
wintertime my feet can get really dry so
I want to make sure I exfoliate them a
lot I also repurchase my big sea salt
shampoo you guys my love is I have a
whole haircare video you can check out
below if you want to know anything about
my hair it's in that video I also got
this pin and inside I told the guy I
want something more moisturizing than
the rose argan oil what's it called
I can't remember taught my head with
that stuff is called that I use rose
Argan I forget I'll put the name right
here but I told the guy that I wanted
something that's a little bit more
moisturizing than that and he
recommended this I'll
their name if I can find it right here
but it doesn't really smell good but he
said this is like really really really
really good you won't have to put any
moisturizer on after you guys shower so
I was like I'd give me a block I'm gonna
try it
see if I like it because I'm really lazy
when I go to shower I don't want to
apply lotion all over my body all the
time so I'm hoping that this will work
really well for me and supposedly you're
supposed to like shower do everything
and then right before you get out again
just put it all over your skin and I
think you rinse it off I can't remember
if you said it rinsed it off or not
I wish lush would come out with a candle
that smells like all of their back melts
and their bath bombs all together like
you know it's smelly have I would
purchase the hell out of that candle but
the first one I got was this one I don't
remember the name of this one it smells
like double bubble but we'll go on
though
oh it smells so good you can break these
up and use these at different times and
like I said it's just a bath melt oh my
god smells so good the next one is a
really well-known one this is called
comforter I believe this is smells so
good too I'm obsessed with it this is a
really really big product too so you can
break that up a lot of time it's like a
floral scent and it has like a little
flower on it and this smells really good
I like this a lot so I find out the
names of these I will link them down
below and try to find them for you guys
to the camera talk to my head so yeah
that's all I got and I hope you guys
