to be sharing with you this makeup look
now when I sat down I was like okay I
want to do something with drugstore
makeup because it's been a hot damn
minute since I have done something with
drugstore me I wanted to sit down do
this for you guys and the first thing
that I thought of was like an easy fall
makeup look that anyone can do so this
is for my girls who are just struggling
with their winged liner and hate doing
it or if you just don't want to work
false lashes and want something kind of
easy to do but still look like your fall
ready I think this is the perfect look
for you it was so easy to do I used all
drugstore makeup products I did not use
drugstore brushes just because I don't
have any I have affordable brushes like
morphe but I don't have any drugstore
brush sets so if you have any favorite
ones
let me know in the comments because I
feel like they're hard to find I think
if you're looking for a more affordable
brand for brushes I definitely recommend
more feet I'll leave their link down
below in a coupon code for you guys if
you're interested all of the makeup
products to use are drugstore and you
can go to Ulta CVS and get them right
now if you want I really hope you guys
enjoyed this look and enjoy the concept
if you want to know how I got my hair
like this I did a mini tutorial in my
last video I just added some hair
extensions because I'm running on the
third day here now and I needed some
volume in my life and these just look
really helped me out so if you also want
to see what extensions I use I will link
them below with a little coupon so you
can get a free gift check out but I love
foxy locks and they always use them when
I need that volume but if you want to
know how I got these curls I did do that
in my last video so help you enjoy this
video if you did please give it a thumbs
up and don't forget to leave a comment
down below letting me know your favorite
brushes or favorite drugstore makeup
products at the moment I feel like I
can't find any new drugstore products
lately and it's like really
disappointing every time I go to Target
or something I'm looking and I see
nothing new and I'm just like so yeah if
you want to see how I got this makeup
look then let's just get started okay so
the first thing I'm going to take is
this NYX I want pop palette and I'm
going to take this shade right here and
use it as my transition shade and I'm
just going to apply this into a crease
and just really blending this out and a
transition shade is really great for any
look because it helps any color you put
on your lid
fade up towards the brow bone really
easily so I'm just going to fluff this
into the crease and I do have tape on
the ends of my eye just to give me a
nice sharp line so I don't have to do a
lot of cleanup afterwards then I'm gonna
take this total intensity eye shadow
I'll have the names of everything in the
description box below but I love this
color because it's so beautiful it's
just a gorgeous copper and it looks so
good all over the lid and this eye
shadow is super pigmented as well so I
really like this brand so far for
eyeshadow but I'm just going to put this
all over my lid
and also take it up to the crease with a
blending brush this is gonna be a very
kind of I don't know blended look with
just a lot of color okay then I'm gonna
take that Club we just use and put that
into the crease just to blend out the
edges of these eye shadows then I'm
gonna take this NYX eyeshadow and I love
this color is so beautiful I'm gonna put
it from halfway on my lid out to the
outer corner so I'm gonna leave that
inner corner open for the copper and put
this NYX eye shadow on the rest of the
eye I personally like these two together
if you don't like them I'm sorry but I
like them together and I love the
shimmery look that it gives it's just
really pretty and colorful and I just
love it
I'm gonna take this shade and the bottom
pop palette and we're just going to
lightly put this into the crease and
we're also gonna make kind of just a
v-shape on our outer corner so you can
see I'm making that v-shape here and
just dragging this into the crease I'm
not going all the way to the inner
corner I'm stopping about halfway but
this will help blend out that knick
shadow and just make everything look
nice and defined and it just adds a
little bit more definition to this look
now I'm taking the NYX CC cream this is
a green primer that they have it is
supposed to neutralize redness and I
think it did neutralize quite a bit but
I really like this primer it felt really
good on the skin even if I didn't like
completely cover up my redness um it
still was really really nice now I'm
taking the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation and I'm gonna put this all
over my skin it looks really really
really warm mainly because it is really
warm but with the lighting it looks a
little bit more warm than it actually
was
but when we put on a concealer it'll
look a lot better so I'm taking the
niche NYX HD concealer and putting this
underneath my eyes and like a triangle
shape you know just highlighting and
everything and I'm gonna go ahead and
blend that out with a makeup geek
foundation brush and then I'll take the
concealer and put it in the center of my
face and you'll see how this just all
comes together I really like this
concealer you just have to really really
work with it I need a darker shade but
you know I'm lazy I don't feel like
going to get another one
so now I'm taking this rice powder which
is really awesome I love this powder
it's a great powder from the drugstore
it's really nice and fine and it just
blends in beautifully so I'm gonna use
this to set all of my concealer so
underneath my eyes and in the center of
my face and I am using a morphe brush to
apply it after that I went and I was
gonna apply false lashes but I decided
not to and I just went ahead and put
mascara on and filled in my brows and
I'll use my and I'll list what I use to
put my brows down below I just followed
the shape of them it just took me
forever but I love the NYX brow pencil
it's really really great so I highly
recommend it like I said I'll leave it
down below then I'm taking the elf
contour palette and taking the more warm
bronzy shade and applying that on tops
of my forehead my cheeks and underneath
my neck or underneath my jaw and then
I'm taking the darkest shade in the
palette and using this makeup geek brush
to contour and I love this color because
it contours really well it's just a nice
ashy contour that's not too pigmented it
just creates a really gorgeous shadow
underneath your cheekbone and again I'm
going to apply some tops of my forehead
underneath my lip and then right there
at that contour line underneath the
cheek so here I'm just showing you how
easy and like pretty it looks I love it
so I'm using this NYX blush in bronze
and I'm gonna apply this to the apples
of my cheeks and then put it back
towards my hairline I love this blush so
pretty don't be too scared if you apply
too much like I did here cuz they're
really easy to blend out so I'm just
taking this brush and blending it that
out until I'm happy with how it looks
and then for highlighter I'm taking the
L'Oreal Lumi the easy liquid highlighter
this one's the more bronze one and I'm
just gonna apply this on to talk to my
cheekbones with this little brush and I
like this highlighter it's not
necessarily like my all-time favorite
from the drugstore but it is really easy
to apply and I like it cuz it's subtle
but it's not too settled and now I'm
gonna take this NYX eyeshadow and put
this in the inner corner of my eye so
around my tear duct area and
right in the beginning of my lower
lashline then I'm gonna take that other
copper shade and just put this on the
other part of my lower lash line and
just really smoke this out you can drag
this down quite a bit to give it a nice
smoky ER look or you could keep it
really close to the lash line to make it
a little more simple I'm a very smoky
esque person so I like to drag this down
quite a bit and then I'm gonna take my
mascara which this is from L'Oreal it's
like the miss manga something it's not
the missing manga the purple one but
it's like the other version it's really
good and then I'm gonna go ahead and
move on to lips i'm taking this nyx deep
purple lip liner and i'm gonna line my
lips with that and then taking the NYX
liquid suede lipstick yes I'm going to
apply this on top I love these little
lipsticks from NYX NYX just has really
great drugstore products so that's why I
use them a lot of the time I think
you're gonna spend your money on
drugstore products NYX is one of the
best brands to go to so definitely check
them out but that is it for this look I
hope you guys enjoyed it don't forget to
thumbs up and I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
