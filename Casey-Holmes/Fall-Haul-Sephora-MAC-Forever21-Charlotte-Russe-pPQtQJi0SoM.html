a haul I went shopping a few days ago
and I posted a picture on Instagram and
has much requests to do a haul which
these are my favorite videos to film
they're just so fun and I just I don't
know I love hauls I love watching them I
love filming them I love everything
about hauls but anyways obviously I'm in
a different setup what do you think
about this one a bunch of guys said that
you loved when I had my closet in the
background and a lot of you said you
liked it when my vanity was in the
background so I kind of merged the two
together let me know what you think I
still gotta get a mirror for this side
and everything like that but I'm think
you guys might like this better thumbs
up if you do so um also I bought some
stuff from NYX
off-hook look if you guys don't know
what that is I'll link it down below as
always it's not gonna come in for like a
couple weeks so if you guys want me to
do a haul and do like swatches and show
you guys each and every product then
just let me know down below and I'll do
that when it comes in also I'm gonna
show you guys what I got I'm gonna show
you what I got online first let me show
you my first favorite purchase because I
love this self tanner
so I did repurchase my self tanner this
is the Sun guys self tanner I talked
about it all the time
it came with um this is a pack of ten
samples I actually came with two of
these I have one of these in my purse
right now
but then I have this one which is
awesome so I don't know I do they do two
packs of these or is it I used like I
got one last time but I got two sets so
got 20 samples and then a full size
bottle so I won't even open this come
down with the samples but this is what
the bottle looks like this is my
favorite self tanner if you don't know I
absolutely love it I self tan last night
so today I kind of feel like a whole new
woman I love this stuff so much I'll put
a coupon code down below I mean I use my
own coupon code on my what do you call
it on my checkout so I'll put the coupon
code I use down below it is my code but
whatever it's a code right and then I
ordered some stuff from Sephora I just
three things that some samples random
but I told you guys I wanted to get a
high end foundation and I ended up
getting the one that I told you guys I
really wanted to get which is the makeup
for ever matte velvet plus I got number
40 and 45 if you are interested 40 is
when I'm tan 35 is more when my tans
kind of fading and I'm not as self tan
like today I have 140 in a matches
perfectly so if you don't know what it
looks like this is what the bottle looks
like they're really small and slim and
cute but they're tiny as hell this is
how it looks compared to my hand they're
really really tiny but this is a great
foundation I know it's kind of a splurge
to get to but when you self tan you kind
of have to have two different
foundations because your skin's not
always going to be that same color
unless you constantly people keep up
with yourself Terra which I don't do I'm
kind of lazy so that's why I got two of
those then I also got this makeup
forever professional super matte loose
powder when I saw that it said super
matte I had to get this so that's what
the box looks like and a jar is super
cute I haven't used it yet
but it just looks like this and I got
mine in transparent natural I do believe
so it just has like little things all
around and then you just twist it open
it has a nice puff this is actually
really nice puff and then just the
product on the inside end up going with
parent transparent natural because I
didn't want to chance getting a color
that's two doors or something like that
you know what I mean so I just picked
that I also placed an order and I place
one with justfab.com
this is what their little boxes look
like now I know about you you're
probably like I thought you didn't like
JustFab I it's not that I don't like
them it's that I because I got some
sandals for them and I love them and
some flats or whatever they're up there
I really really do like them they're
great quality but I heard from a birdy
was just like one of my really good
friends Taylor she said that she found
the same shoes that I had for like
twelve dollars and stored them all so I
was like really I paid $40 each for
these sandals and they're like twelve
dollars at the mall
it was so annoying and Beauvoir long
story short I found a coupon code for
$20 off a pair of shoes on JustFab and
they have boots on there and everything
like that they have heels and all that
but their boots are normally 39th I like
all their shoes are 3995 and you cannot
pass getting a pair of shoes for $20
especially a pair of boots nice pair of
boots so of course I created an account
and um use that coupon code because I
really wanted it and I actually saw
these boots at forever 21 I wanted to
get him like a few weeks ago but I
didn't pick him up for some odd reason
and when I saw him on um and JustFab I
had to get them $20 why not they're just
a little quilted they call The Amanda
like it's like Amanda within I don't
know but this is what they look like
they're super super cute go up like that
you also have this zipper right here and
I just love them they also kind of
stretch right here so if your calves are
a little bit bigger it kind of stretches
for you so got him in a size 8 for 20
dollars so I got him cheaper for what
I've got them even at forever 21 so I
thought that was a great deal also I
will put the link and to keep on I use
down below so you can know against you
some $20 off or some $20 shoes so I went
to Target I was trying to find the Sonia
Kashuk eye brightening powder but I
couldn't find it I don't think my target
carries it I don't know why but I ended
up going to the Essie nail polish
section and getting two new polishes and
I really like these this first one is
what I have on my nails right now this
is miss fancy-pants that's what it looks
like it is so pretty I thought this
would be great for fall and granted I
don't like smel collage that much
because it does chip very easily but I
mean there's such cute colors I can't
pass them up and then I love this one I
want to paint this on my toes as soon as
possible this one is in Aruba blue and
it's just the most gorgeous shade of
blue ever oh I'm in love with it it's
better than like your just plain old
dark blue this is like the most gorgeous
blue effort how many times can I say
that then I went and stopped by a couple
places in the mall and of course I went
to
Matt I ask too much to you guys if you
had a blush recommendation and I had so
many in my mind that I wanted to try
when I got to the counter I like totally
just it went over my brain not even
think about it so I didn't know getting
one that nobody has really talked about
or recommended to me it's a sheer tone
shimmer blush and this one's in spring
Sheen and I really like this blush
because it's so pretty and I think it's
gonna be great for fall so this is what
it looks like and again it's in spring
soon you probably can't really tell them
really like that's true to color right
there when I think alit back like that
but this is such a soft velvety blush
powder it's so gorgeous and I really
really love this color so that's what it
looks like I think it's gonna be great
for fall just to kind of give you that
rosy kind of flushed look in cheeks like
not too flushed but just a little bit so
love this blush and then I finally
picked up the one I've been wanting for
so long the first time I ever saw this
was when SNL picked it up I think it was
like forever ago and I was like oh my
god I have to get that blush and for the
longest time I've always wanted it I
just never picked it up and I finally
remembered and picked it up and it is
the Mac blush in one so this is a
mineralized blush so that's what it
looks like a lot of people complain
about this being too glittery or
something but it's not to me and I'm
actually kind of picky on my blushes and
then being really Clary and all that
crap but this is more like I don't know
it's like a cute little bronzy color
it's not really anything too crazy
it looks really light right now you
probably can't even see it but this is
just something nice to put on your
cheeks if you don't want nothing too
crazy like color wise on there it does
add a nice dimension like I do have it
on today so it's kind of like a tanner
color I don't know it looks really
pretty I love this blush you need to go
try it if you go by Mac Pro it's the
best I went to forever 21 the best thing
about forever 21 is you can go there and
get a lot of stuff for like a low amount
of money or is that the right way to say
you know enemies but um
I did get to a big jacket I wanted it in
black but I didn't see it until I
actually was leaving the store so I
might go pick that one back up because I
really really want it but they're just
little like faux leather jackets like
this I of course got one in white these
are only twenty two fifty apiece so I
love the zipper detailing and then you
also have it on the sleeve so I just
thought this jacket was so so so cute I
love it and then I also got one in this
like taupe Brown kind of color I don't
know it's really really pretty and it's
just the same exact jacket just I can
get it just in different color so I love
that I thought was really pretty so I
got a few shirts um I did I don't know
what's going on me and polka dots you'll
find out where this is from like a
couple minutes but I something is up
with me and the polka dots
I never really liked polka dots but
lately it's been like I'm more liking
them but these are only two shirts I
haven't polka dots so I might be just
crazy but this is the first one I got
it's like a mint green color with black
dots and this was a 980 and I also loved
the bag detail how I just had the bows
super super cute then I got this tank
top this was 1980 has sequins all over
it for the front and the back and what I
really love is like I hate it when
shirts have sequins on the front but
then have a plain back that just gets on
my nerves
so it was really excited to see that
this had it all the way around so really
nice super super comfortable then I just
got this ruffle shoulder shirt really
simple 680 super cute I love shirts with
like the little poofy sleeves I think
they're really cute and then I also got
the same kind of color just a little bit
darker this was a thirteen eighty and
this one's really flattering because in
the front it's really ruched and nice so
it kind of like crinkles up a little bit
I don't know it's really pretty and then
the back is just plain so that's that
and then I got this one this is probably
like my favorite shirt I got forever 21
and it's just a burgundy kind of chiffon
top
don't look like much just hang in here
but like once you put it on it looks so
freaking nice I love it so much so
that's just what looks like of course
the sleeves just button down at the
bottom and it just has this really nice
little back the black at the top
whatever you know what I'm saying so
then I went to Charlotte Russe they
always have great deals on their shoes
no matter what time of the year when it
is they've always got some serious deals
on their shoes so I'm going to show you
the two pairs of boots I got I know
boots again I'm going crazy with the
boots this is the first pair I actually
have this pair in brown that I got last
year actually bought the black pair too
last year but I wore them out so much
like I had holes in the soles of the
shoes it was so bad but I had to throw
them out and of course I had to
repurchase them again this year because
I warmed so much last year they go with
everything and I really loved them so I
had to pick up another pair of these and
then to make it 1550 or whatever or
which I don't know which one they did 15
v dance whatever the cheapest one was
but had to pick this pair up I don't
have a pair of boots this color so it
just looks like this with the buckles
and it's super cute goes up pretty high
and I really really like it it's cute I
like it Charlotte Russe just I love
their deals on her shoes it's so insane
I love it like I said I you think this
shirt from there I'll show you I love
the fact that it has like the boat neck
in the front but it also has it in the
bag it's just a polka dot shirt it's
really really cute I love it it doesn't
have puffy sleeves I think that would
make it too girly then I got these
cushion insoles the first pair is
cheetah and there's a black pair behind
it I just wanted these for some boots
because I just want to make my feet
comfortable so that's that and those are
comfortable I just like when I first
breaking in boots like no matter what
boots I've been trying to break in they
always hurt my feet so have to protect
them then I got this scarf that I'm in
love with
so cute it's really full and this was
9:50 but what I really love about it is
it does have like all the bows and stuff
on it but if you look really closely the
bows have skulls in it but look how cute
that is
like little skulls and the bows oh my
gosh
you guys know when I saw that I died so
I had to pick it up I'm not a huge scarf
wear but I really think this one's gonna
be one I'm really gonna wear out for
fall because it's just so cute and then
I got one more shirt that is so
beautiful you guys like seriously it's
beautiful
check out that color um this is so
freaking cute I love it and it looks
like it's a button-down but it's not
it's just seemed in so you just pull it
over and it's just gorgeous
like how could anyone pass up this shirt
oh I love it so much it's so pretty and
I thought you really cute with the brown
boots I just showed you from Charlotte
Russe so that's that oh I love that
color if you're interested in saying
more business casual stuff I did go to
Marshalls and about to show you what I
kind of wear to work so if you're still
interested in saying that if you're even
still watching then um I'll show you the
guy so mainly what's Marshalls to get
some business casual pants like
something just to kind of throw a wand
that I really like some dress pants
dress pants are great um even if you're
young because as you can older you and
me go into interviews and stuff like
that they're great to wear to interviews
and then you never know what job you get
like mine's business casual but more
business than casual if that makes any
sense so you can't be super casual at
work but anyways for show you that I did
pick up this healthy sexy hair hot iron
hairspray I've tried this a couple times
don't exactly know what I think about it
yet it doesn't smell good but still
trying it out it holds a curl really
well but I don't know I don't know what
I don't know but this is ten dollars at
Marshall's
okay so I'll show you a couple shirts I
got I also got this one in white but I
already wore it to work and these are
only $7.99 piece so you really can't
pass it up so I just got this one and
Cole bought blue and I also got the
white one as well and then I got this
one which I really love it's super cute
great for work it's just the striped
shirt it kind of cinches in at the waist
that that one side but that makes it so
flattering on it's really cute I can't
remember how much it was cuz I did why
this life the other day to work so let
me show you the pants I got I did just
get a pair of plain black slacks nothing
special we all know what black slacks
look like hopefully then I got this pair
this is actually from Express and these
are on sale for 16 dollars which is
great because usually these are like 60
bucks so and this is what they look like
they are super super cute very
flattering on and that's just the back
so I did get these for $16 now these two
pair are from the brand called the
limited and I'm officially obsessed with
that brand
I've been trying out these cheap these
pants and I really love them I went
online to look at their other pants to
try buy some more because I couldn't
find them all at Marshall's I wanted
some black ones like this but they're
like $70 online and I got these for only
17 a piece so I was like I just keep an
eye out at Marshall's but these are the
limited these are the drew fit and
they're so freakin cute I love them so I
just got this color I love this color I
know but you're like who cares but if
you're like business casual one that's
basically what you live in then you have
to try to find something cute you know
what I mean and then I got the same drew
fit ones from the limited and these are
in just a darker gray color if you guys
are interested in me doing like a video
showing you like appropriate work or
like interview makeup or in a tire or
something like that let me know because
I'll do it but and a lot of you asked me
where I work and once again I'm not
gonna say because it's a good job and I
don't want to you know mess anything up
