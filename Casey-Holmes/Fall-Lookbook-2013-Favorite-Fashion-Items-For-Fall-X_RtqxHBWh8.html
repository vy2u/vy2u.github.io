kind of a fall lookbook I just want to
show you guys things I'm going to be
loving for fall that are really
affordable I never do fashion videos but
a lot of you since I've been posting you
know different outfits on my Instagram
have been asking me to do more fashion
videos so I figure it follows my
favorite time for clothes and making my
style more edgy I just I don't know I
love fall it's just such a fun time
really quickly I'm going to show you
guys some things that pop up a lot in
this video and just kind of let you know
where they're from so the first thing
are these sunglasses they are from
forever 21 almost everything in this
video is from them it's not sponsored I
bought it with my own money but a lot of
things don't from them because I find
that they're so affordable and I'm like
on that site every single day ridiculous
but I got these sunglasses from them I
love them I never thought I would like
forever 21 sunglasses but these have a
completely stole my heart these are the
D frames and they kind of have that cat
eye effect so I wore these and pretty
much every clip the next thing you're
gonna see a lot on me in this video
which you'll see it on me a lot in fall
is combat boots this is the most
exciting thing I am you know ready to
wear for fall because I love comment
boots I got these last year I wore them
to death and I'm wearing them again this
year and I love them these are actually
from HauteLook like I said I bought them
last year but almost everybody has
combat boots now you could pretty much
find these anywhere at forever 21
Charlotte Russe HauteLook does have you
know sales that come on where you can
buy the that at an affordable price and
I got a deal on these I got these for
$45 I believe and they lasted really
well so I'll put that link down below if
you want to check out hook look but like
I said forever 21 Charlotte Russe they
all have them ok another kind of trend
you'll be seeing on me in this video and
for fall is already print oh I cannot
stress to you how happy I am the army
print is so on trend right now
this jacket is actually from necessary
clothing I got it in the mail today but
I love it has the army print and it has
like the pleather sleeves which I love
that too like anything pleather oh
obsessed with so this is super cute and
I just I don't know I really like it
it's not
everybody's style that I personally love
the more grunge edgy kind of style I'm
not a very super girly kind of person
like I don't I don't know like I won't
wear pink and stuff like that I don't
know it's just not my thing
again speaking of the you know pleather
stuff I love the whole mixing textures
like this this is the pleather shoulders
and then just like the cotton you know
sweatshirt this is also from forever 21
I love it I just I love the pleather so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
