a tutorial on this look a lot of you
wanted to see more of a dark lip makeup
tutorial for fall so I figured I would
go to one of my favorite shades for fall
and then his max rebel now if you don't
have max rebel and you really just don't
want to spend $15 on a lipstick you can
go buy this Wet n Wild lipstick in for
Goosen Chris Cabernet I don't know
that's a naming it it's basically the
same exact shade like seriously swatched
both on my hands this one's the Mac one
this one's the forget one very very
similar you can always just use this one
and be good to go so there's you a dupe
for it I hope you guys enjoy this video
I did use some of my new makeup geek
eyeshadows that I bought the other day I
had mentioned in a video I think it was
my get ready with me that I had bought
some makeup geek eyeshadows and a lot of
you want to see a tutorial with them so
I will do a tutorial for you guys
I love these shadows so far everybody
has been raving about them and everybody
has been buying them and I would always
stop myself on the website but I
wouldn't actually make a purchase and
finally I was like I'm just gonna get
these I got this one because Jaclyn
Jaclyn hill always talks about it and
uses it and I love this shade on her so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thumbs up if you want a red lip makeup
tutorial I think when I do that I'm
gonna do more of a smoky eye thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed it and let's go ahead and get
onto the story so we're gonna start with
the eyes I'm going to prime first off
with Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre now
taking you these makeup geek eyeshadows
this is a really simple look so it's
gonna be really quick
taking creme Brule with my matte 224
put this all over the crease blending it
all over the lid kinda just everywhere
I like this color I think I like it a
lot more than soft ochre because it's
just it's a lot warmer and a lot more
pigmented I feel like this is a really
nice shadow and I blend really really
well color right here it's called frappe
Emily to get it clean Sigma e25 turn up
shade I'm focusing this more on the
crease but I'm still blending it really
well on the lid as well I'm going to
take this wet and wild shadow and I'm
gonna take the lightest shade in here oh
that was wrong one then that cream shade
right there I'm gonna put this on my lid
mainly focus it on the first half just
to kind of lighten up the look and I'll
drag any excess out like so I do take my
pencil brush
that's a matte highlight I'm gonna put
this in the inner corner
and now I'm going to take the matte
highlight shade again going underneath
the brows the tart inner rim liner this
is in black
I'm going to use this on my upper
waterline just a tight line there meant
a black liquid liner from Maybelline
just the first one I grab and I'm going
to do a winged eyeliner winged eyeliner
and a bold lip you can never go wrong
but now we're going to curl the lashes
and apply mascara I'm using my wife L
baby girl that's Kara we got in the face
I'm going to take my covergirl
foundations I've done a whole foundation
routine if you want to check it out I
will link it down below
okay now we're going to go in with my
mac prolongwear concealer and then see
twenty and thirty six and then I'm going
to apply this underneath my eyes right
here in the inner part and out along the
top of my cheeks to hold it down here
for the triangle shape underneath my
eyes it looks really scary at first but
it'll all look like Glinda and once we
use the bleep Beauty Blender then I'm
going in with my makeup forever super
matte loose powder and setting guys
under eye concealer that's my Sigma F a
six brush that I love just to set my
face makeup I'm going in with my NARS
powder and mountain and it just looks
like this I haven't show my NARS
patterns enough love so that's I've been
using no more and I'm just going to take
my big brush from Sigma this is the
large powder at 30 came in with or it
came with my um mr. bunny set I'm just
pressing this onto my skin now we're
going going with this bronze or the NYC
Sun and bronze and am on top bronze and
my Mac 134 we're just going to
this is our cheeks
just gives you that nice like sunkissed
look I love it you guys really gotta try
this out I know I talk about it a lot
but seriously for a four dollar bronzer
it's good stuff I am going to put blush
on and the blush I'm using is kind of
like a bronze color it's alpine bronze
from Mac you can use whatever you want
to use I just really love this color
which is why I use it all the time and
it was limited edition so I am sorry I
just love it so much then I just blend
it out with bronzer with my Real
Techniques stippling brush I do my brows
I'm using the anastacio
brow it
okay brows are done now for the lower
lash line I am going to use a brown
because I've been loving using Brown
lately so I'm using this Sigma eyeliner
imbalance frappe color from makeup geek
that one with a pencil brush and I'm
going to just put this on so I'm gonna
put this on my lower lash line then take
your mascara and do your lower lashes
unless I'm going to take this NYX lip
liner it is in a deep purple this is the
perfect lip liner for our Mac rebel from
the drugstores so I highly recommend it
and I'm going to just line my lips so
just like that and then I'm gonna go in
with Mac's rebel which was a really
popular color last year and it's another
popular color this year it's going to
fit on my lips
and then that is pretty much it you
throw always that it clear gloss on top
if you want to be a little bit more
velocity thank you guys so much for
watching I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
