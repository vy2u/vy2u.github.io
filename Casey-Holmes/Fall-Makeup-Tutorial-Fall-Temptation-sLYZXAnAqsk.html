a tutorial on this look it's just a nice
kind of smokey eye and I used a quad
that is out from Maybelline this is from
their new fall line it is a limited
edition collection so if you want it I
recommend going and picking it up
but it is called a fall temptation it
just has really nice Browns it has a
nice you have a nice deep matte Brown a
nice shimmery Brown it kind of like
peach color and then a champagne color
so those are must the colors I use I did
use a makeup geek eyeshadow as my
transition shade you could use a bronzer
or your face powder whatever for your
transition shade if you do not want to
buy the makeup geek one I hope you guys
enjoy this video thank you so much for
watching don't forget to give it a big
thumbs up and I will see you all in the
next video
so the first thing we're doing of course
is priming our eyes with my Mac Paint
Pot in soft ochre just so our shadows
stay all day long
the first color I'm going to go with is
this light peach color and I'm going to
apply this all over the lid and make
sure it's nice and opaque after that I'm
going to apply this makeup geek
eyeshadow and creme brulee and I'm using
this as my transition shade keep in mind
you can use your face powder or your
bronzer as this shade but this is what
I'm using and I'm just applying it all
over the crease and up towards the brow
bone
then taking the shimmery Brown and the
pallet with a sigma e25 I think yes I'm
going to put this into the crease and I
don't want to take this above my
transition shade but I do want to kind
of deepen up this crease a lot so I'm
just going to apply it in the crease a
couple times and blend it out as I go
and then after you've applied it I'm
just going to blend out a little bit
more with this Mac 224 brush taking the
matte brown shade with an angled brush
from Sigma I'm going to place this on
the outer half of my eyes and this
angled brush will really make it super
easy to create that outer V shape and
you want to focus this eyeshadow on the
outer half don't bring it too far onto
the lid after you've got place we're
just going to take a clean sigma e25 and
blend this out I am blending it a little
bit further out towards my brow just to
create a more dramatic outer V and then
blending any excess into the crease but
trying to not put a lot on the lid where
that peach is
going back in with that makeup geek
eyeshadow I'm just going to reapply this
where my transition shade is and blend
out any harsh lines that I might have
and now I'm taking a cream eyeshadow and
I'm applying this right underneath my
brows as my highlight and one of the
peaks should be a little bit more
vibrant so I'm just going back in with
that same light peach shade and applying
this mainly to the inner half of my lid
and then I'll go back in here in a
second and blend out any excess that
might have gotten into the crease with a
blending brush taking this Maybelline
master precise eyeliner I'm just going
to create a winged eyeliner if you want
to see a tutorial on this I will link it
down below in the description box and I
will be curling my lashes with a Tarte
eyelash curler and applying my yl
mascara to my lashes my tart inner rim
liner to my upper waterline and my Jane
Cosmetics brown eyeliner to my bottom
water pot on waterline and now I'm going
in with that matte Brown I wanted to
deepen up the look a little bit more so
I'm going to focus is mainly on the
outer half kind of right where my wing
ends and put some into the crease and
this is really gonna help deepen up the
look make it a little bit more smoky
this is totally optional if it's smoky
enough for you before this then go ahead
and keep that but I wanted to you know
make it a little bit more dramatic so
now I'm taking my Mac 224 and blending
this shadow so it's nice and seamless I
did use my covergirl three-in-one
foundation and my Mac Pro Longwear
concealer if you want to see my current
foundation routine I will link it down
below I'm using my Bobbi Brown browser
in golden light in
at the skin and then I wanted to contour
since this was a dramatic eye look and
I'm using my Jane Cosmetics bronzer and
empower with a Mac brush I forget the
number
and I'm just contouring my face even
more for blushed I used Mac's Melba this
blush literally goes with anything it's
so pretty and I'm just going to apply
this to my cheeks and then I will be
filling in my brows today with my
Anasazi of brow is in brunette taking
that shimmery Brown again I'm going to
use a pencil brush I think it's the e30
and I'm going to apply this on my lower
lash line to smoke it out even more
after that you want to apply your
mascara to your lower lashes and then
I'm taking the anastacio tinted brow gel
and just setting my brows so they last
all day lining my lips with Jordana's
lip liner in tawny this is a gorgeous
lip liner I love it because it's a nice
nude shade and I'm going to be using the
lipstick from Wet n Wild this is called
Fermi daily and I will top it off with
Mac's
Flor abundance lip glass and then you
are done so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video please give it a thumbs up and if
