a makeup tutorial on the look that I
have now and this is a very requested
tutorial this was from my August
favorites video and I figured I'm going
to do it for you I love this look
especially the pigment that I use
because it is so perfect for fall
because fall is coming up so I figured
I'd go ahead and get a jump start on the
fall tutorials for you guys I do have a
few in mind that I want to do and there
will be some drugstore ones coming up so
just keep an eye out for that but today
the pigment that I used in that video is
right now my favorite favorite pigment
because it has all the colors I love
it's like a goal but it has like a hint
of green it's just gorgeous so this is
from Mac and it's called old gold and
this is just what it looks like it's a
beautiful beautiful pigment
I love Mac pigments and if you don't
want to buy this big whole bottle you
can always just go to Mac and ask for a
sample and they'll give you a sample
that will probably last you like forever
because I'll probably never ever
finished this but you can just go to Mac
asked for example if you don't want to
buy it and yeah I just I can't remember
exactly what I use on my face that dang
I did switch out my bronzers for like
drugstore browsers and I remember the
blush that I use but I just went with
what the look looked like so I hope you
guys enjoy it and also I did curl my
hair with my nume 25 millimeter one and
all my coupon codes for a new mirror are
still active to get the hundred and ten
dollars off of curling wands and get to
400 and stuff like that so I will link
all of that information down below in
the description box so hope you guys are
doing this video and let's go ahead and
get on to the tutorial okay so I went
ahead and applied these products to my
face before I started filming so they
could just kind of sink into my skin and
start working and now I'm taking Mac's
Paint Pot in soft ochre I love this to
prime my eyes with I use it for every
eyeshadow tutorial I do even in day to
day life so I love it now I'm taking my
mac 242 brush spraying it with some mac
fix+
and I'm taking the pigment Olde gold
from Mac and I'm just going to apply
this all over the lid and I absolutely
love this pigment it is so pretty and it
really brings out brown eyes I just oh
so in love with it
and you can use any brush that you
prefer
just as long as it's flat and kind of
dense and it really packs on color I'm
just using the Mac one because that's
the one I had on hand at the moment
after you've applied all of that you're
gonna go ahead and take soft brown and
you're gonna want to blend this into the
crease and just kind of blend out that
edge with the pigment so it's not so
harsh you can use a bronzer for this a
darker face powder or whatever you want
to do
I will also have each brush that I used
down in the description box below
now I'm taking another Mac shadow this
is called soba it's really hard to
explain kind of what color it is I feel
like it's a brown with a gold chain I
don't know it's so pretty I never seen
anybody use it on YouTube and I just
think it goes really really great with
this look since it does have some of
that gold in there so I am taking a
blending brush and just putting this in
the outer half of my eye and mainly
focusing it on the crease just to help
deepen up the crease a little bit more
and it just looks really pretty I like
it a lot now take an expresso from Mac
and using a lash card and I'm going to
set that on the outer half of my eye
again taking a different blending brush
and just blending it into the outer half
like I said usually make sure you blend
it not bring it in too far into the eye
and this is just gonna help give like a
faded effect and add some depth to the
eye look without overpowering it and
making it a super super smoky eye so the
pigment is still you know the start of
the show in this one
then I'm taking soft Brown and going
right above expresso I'm really anal
about my eyeshadows I tend to go in and
add colors a lot so that's just how I am
because I want to make sure everything
is blended and looks seamless now taking
my honest Asya brow Wiz in brunette I do
have a whole brow tutorial I'll link
down below and you can check that out
the only thing different is I'm using
this pencil and then using this wet wild
palette I'm going to use that matte
shade right there and highlight these
palettes are just continued but you can
get them on beauty joy calm I'll have
the link below and now I'm taking these
covergirl outlast foundations and
applying these to my face with a Beauty
Blender if you like an update a
foundation routine with this please let
me know I've been using it so much the
past like week and a half I think oh I
love it so much so if you want a video
on
that then just go ahead and like this
one and I'll get it up for you now I'm
taking you Mac Pro Longwear concealer
and NC 30 and 20 and I'm just mixing
them together and putting them
underneath my eyes I know a lot of you
don't like the amount of concealer that
I put underneath my eyes but I do so you
can use whatever amount you prefer on
your face this is just what I prefer now
I'm taking my NYX set it don't fret it
in light/medium I love this powder it's
a super great dupe for the Make Up For
Ever super matte loose powder which you
guys know is my holy grail and I just
said in my under eyes instead of the
word I don't know so I just set my under
eyes and then my face makeup with this
and then going in with another favorite
product recently this is a NYX matte
bronzer and medium and basically all I'm
doing with this is just hitting it on my
cheekbones and the top of my forehead
and I'm also going to put a little bit
on my chin right below it not eggs
directly on top of my chin but just
right below it just to kind of even out
the bronzer because sometimes we feel
like it looks a little odd if I don't
apply some bronzer there and then I'm
taking the Real Techniques contour brush
I meant to mention this in my August
favorites I highly recommend it it's so
amazing I just went where my contour
line is to sharpen it out a little bit
more put some more bronzer on my temples
and I did go to the tops of the forehead
but I cannot find the clip now I'm
taking this Physicians Formula blush
this isn't natural it's a really really
really pretty pink color it will
literally go with everything and I just
applied that with a blush brush and now
I'm taking Mac's pigment and old gold
again and I'm taking it around my tear
duct and I'm also going to take it in
about halfway on my lower lash line just
to make sure that color really pops
because that's what I want everybody to
focus on when they look at the makeup is
that pigment and then I'm going back in
with expresso with that same pencil
brush again all pencils or not pencils
the brushes I use will be below and I'm
taking expresso and going back into
where that old gold ended and then
extending out that brown out to the
outer half and these are the liner's
that I use today and mascara they're
just my usual so I'll have them all
listed in the description box below and
now I'm taking this NYX pencil and nude
pink and I'm just lining my lips
with it and this is a really nice
natural color so if you're looking for
something that's not too crazy I would
definitely go for this one and then I'm
taking my Mac creme de nude lipstick and
I'm applying it that because I want a
nude lip today with my NYX butter gloss
in a creme brulee because it's literally
my go-to gloss for a nude lip I highly
recommend it and that's pretty much it I
hope you guys enjoyed this video please
excuse my shirt that's what I wear when
I'm dyeing my hair I hope you guys
enjoyed thank you for watching and I'll
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
