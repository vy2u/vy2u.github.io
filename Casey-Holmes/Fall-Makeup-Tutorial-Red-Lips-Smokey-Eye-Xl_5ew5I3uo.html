a tutorial on this look it's just a
smokey eye with a red lip and it's just
one of those classic looks you can use
for the holiday since they are coming up
really soon you can use it for a night
out you know whatever you want to use it
for and also I know I have a different
background let me know if you guys like
this or what made it turn background
with my makeup behind me you follow me
on my vlog channel you saw the process
of me revamping my beauty room so if you
haven't seen it I will link my blog

subscribing to it and get in over 10,000
subscribers over the weekend that was
exciting and I will be having a giveaway
on my beauty channel very soon for you
guys especially for the holidays coming
up so just keep an eye out for that
video I wanna let you guys know I do
appreciate you so much and I thank you
for watching my videos and staying by me
leaving sweet comments and subscribing
to my channel so I hope you guys enjoy
this video and I will see you in my next
one
first things first I'm going to of
course prime my eyes with Mac Paint Pot
in soft ochre going in with my favorite
transition shade this is make it Peaks
eyeshadow and creme Brule I'm going to
blend this all into the crease I'm
blending it all over I absolutely adore
this shade I will leave a link below
where you can get these eyeshadows then
about 6 bucks apiece
but they're great quality and they're
actually a really big pan and I kind of
like them better than Mac eyeshadows
right now speaking of Mac I'm going to
take Swiss chocolate and I'm going to
apply this within Sigma e25 mainly in
the outer V and just going about halfway
into my eye and I'm just gonna blend
this out really nicely it just adds a
little bit more depth to the look so
this is kind of like normal how I
usually do my eye makeup looks but we're
gonna change it up here in a second so
again just blending this all out and
then I go back with the brush I use in
the beginning and blend everything
together I'm gonna go ahead and line my
eyes I'm using my Kat Von D a liquid
eyeliner I don't know exactly what it's
called but it's a nice eyeliner
so I actually thought I was recording
this and I wasn't um but I'm showing you
guys what I did I took a pencil brush
with Mac's carbon which is a black and I
basically outlined in my outer V and
also drug it in to my crease kind of
looks like a cut crease right now but
we're gonna blend it out so it's not
gonna be a dramatic cut crease or
anything like that so I'm gonna take
this brush from Sigma I can't remember
the exact number but I'll leave it down
below this is perfect for dark
eyeshadows in your crease because it
blends it out so beautifully but at the
same time it doesn't get it all over
your eye because it's so small so it's
really nice and precise but it still
blends out the shadow amazing now this
whole step we're doing here I keep going
back in with the black and you know
touching it up it's definitely a process
you can do as dark as you want or as
light as you want but I also do my liner
because it's kind of like a guide for me
where I need to put my black eyeshadow
so if you don't like doing that and you
want to do your eyeliner last you can
but I find that this is easiest for me
so you saw I went back in with the black
again and now I am blending it out and
then next I'm gonna go in with Swiss
chocolate again and I'm going to use a
sigma e25 and just blend this out even
more and kind of drag it a little bit
into the inner half and it just really
helps make it even more smooth and
seamless so that's just what I do but
you know I'm a blending fanatic like I
have to always blend if I have any lines
I go crazy so you could totally skip
that if you want to and then here I'm
just touching up my transition shade
with the makeup geek eyeshadow and creme
brulee and then that's what it looks
like so I am doing the same thing on
this eyes so I'll let you guys just
watch while it's in fast-forward
taking my favorite eyeshadow from wet
and while it's this cream shade and I'm
going to use this as my highlight you
guys know I absolutely love this color
as my highlight if you want to get it in
stores look for this single eyeshadow
called creme brulee I don't know I think
it is I don't know I'll leave it below
what this thing I shadow is called and
it looks just like this it's a beautiful
highlight color now I did prime my face
with my Mac prep and prime and also the
Mac and prep and prime skin refine zone
and the benefit Porefessional and I did
that before my makeup and I liked that
sit so I'm applying this foundation in
the cover row three and ones if you guys
want to see a complete in depth video of
my foundation routine with concealers
and stuff like that I will leave the
link below but for now I'll just let you
watch wha do it
now it's time to fill in the brows which
is one of my favorite parts now I'm
using my Anasazi up brow is in brunette
and then later on I will set them with a
clear about brow gel and this is also in
brunette as well
after curling my lashes I'm using my YSL
babydoll mascara I also forgot to
mention that I did tightline which means
I aligned my upper waterline with a
black liner just so my lashes look a
little bit more full I'm taking this Mac
prep and prime transparent powder and
I'm setting my under eye concealer with
this and then I'll go in with my NARS
powder in Beach and set my face makeup
as well where bronzer I'll be using
Bobbi Brown's golden light today I love
this bronzer it is so pretty I really
recommend it and I'm using my Mac 134
brush
since this is such a dramatic look I do
want to do a strong contour so I'm
taking benefits hoola bronzer and my Mac
109 and I'm just going to contour my
face a little bit more
now it is time to put blush on this is
max alpine bronze it was in a collection
so I am sorry but if you want something
similar go for max warm so it's not as
bronzy but it still gives you that
really pretty glow and then I'm lining
my waterline with this Jordana 12-hour
liner which is the same thing that I
used to tightline and then I'm taking
this pencil brush I didn't put any extra
product on it I'm just taking whatever's
left and kind of smudging out the lower
lash line just to make it look a little
bit more smoky now time for lips I'm
going to be using the Maybelline
lipliner in it's called red really
simple and I'm just lining my lips it
looks like I'm going fast but it's put
in fast forward definitely take your
time with it because red is a hard thing
to go back and say so just take your
time and line your lips and make sure
they're nice and moisturized because
we're gonna be using a matte red this is
max RiRi whoo and I love this shade but
it is so mad you do not want to have
chapped lips when you put this on but if
you don't have RiRi woo you can always
go with Ruby woo from Mac it's very very
similar and they all pretty much look
the same so that's pretty much the look
guys I hope you enjoyed it the next one
should be like a orange eyeshadow
tutorial let me know what other looks
you want to see down below in the
comments below and I will see you guys
