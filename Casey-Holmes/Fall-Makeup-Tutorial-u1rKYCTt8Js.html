a tutorial on this look I had a ton of
requests in my fall outfits video to do
the makeup that I had in that video I
did use a lot of high-end products that
day so I figured I would recreate the
look with more affordable products for
you guys since I know a lot of you want
more drugstore stuff and just some
things that are more affordable so I
figured I would do that for you guys
today
I love eyes shadows that are like red
red brown Burgundy I love red eye shadow
I use them all the time I just think
they're gorgeous
especially on brown eyes they are just
my favorites I did use this BH Cosmetics
galaxy chick palette and I used three
shades from here these are all baked
eyeshadows which are my favorite type of
eyeshadows because they're so freakin
pigmented I've used the afro diet Mars
I think this is called Saturn right yeah
and Saturn's I used these three in the
palette and I just use one Mac eye
shadow just as a transition shade use
like a darker face powder or if you have
this wet and wild vanity palette you
could use this little middle shade right
here as your transition color but
everything else is pretty much drugstore
other than my mascara and my primers I
hope you guys enjoyed this video
also I'm gonna let you guys know that I
have been doing a lot more vlogs on my
vlog Channel and Colton also has his own
channel now too so I will link both of
those down below you should check them
out and subscribe to both of the
channels because we're trying hard to
really put out more vlogs for you guys I
hope you guys enjoyed this video please
give it a thumbs up if you do and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel and I
will see you in my next video bye so
I've already primed my face with these
two primers and I'm going to go ahead
and start off with soft brown with this
sigma e35 brush and all I'm doing is
just buffing this all over the crease
because this is going to be my
transition shade and I'm not really
perfect with it or anything I just kind
of get it all over
dude now for the fun part I'm gonna take
this gorgeous color it's called afro
diet and I'm just going to take my Mac
242 brush I think it is and put this all
over the lid you can see how pigmented
this is I mean it is so stunning this is
definitely one of my favorite palettes
from BH because the colors are just
insanely beautiful
so put that all over the lid and I'm
taking the same brush I used for soft
Brown in the beginning and I'm just
blending out the edge of that eyeshadow
because I don't want it to be too harsh
so I'm just gonna go back and forth and
blend that out and then I'm going in
with the Mars eyeshadow which is just a
nice deep brown and I'm taking the lash
card and I'm just gonna put this on the
outer half of my eye I'm using the lash
card so I can have a nice sharp edge but
of course if you don't get a nice sharp
edge when doing this you can go in with
concealer and fix it up but I do like to
put this brown on the outer half just to
kind of deepen up the look
so after you got that eyeshadow on the
outer half of your eye we're just gonna
go ahead and go in with the Mac 217
brush and we're just going to blend out
again these lines just to make sure we
don't have any harsh edges with this
look since it is very very dramatic I
don't want it to be too harsh of edges
just counts odd and then I'm gonna take
Saturn which is just a beautiful
beautiful shade I'm taking it with my
pencil brush and putting this in the
inner corner it's the perfect color for
this because it's not too light but it
still opens up the eye and then I'm
taking this matte cream shade just to
use as a highlight underneath my brows
you can use whatever you want I just
used a shade from a wet and wild palette
that I had now I'm going on to face this
the covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation and I'm applying it with the
Beauty Blender I did do my brows I'll
leave a brow tutorial below because it
does take me a little while to do them I
just use my Anasazi of brow Wiz in
brunette and to conceal underneath the
eyes I did use this Jane cosmetics
concealer and light I love this
concealer you guys is so good I will
tell you more about it in a future video
but you need to try it out if you've
never tried it out because it's amazing
now my nose doesn't tend to hold
foundation very well so I'm taking this
Mac palette and taking those two
concealer shades with my Beauty Blender
and I'm just putting those on top of my
nose because I don't know it likes the
concealer but not any foundation at all
now I'm taking the NYX set it don't fret
it matte finishing powder and setting my
under eyes and also my face makeup now
for my favorite part for ronzo I adore
this bronzer - it's a new one it's from
NYC and it's called Montauk bronze I
have no idea you guys
I'm taking my Mac brush and I'm just
going to put this on the tops of my
cheeks I'm just going to bronze up my
skin with this I will also have all
products I've used in this video and
brushes in the description box below if
you're interested
Oh
now to give myself more of a strong
contour I'm gonna take this Jane bronzer
and in power and I'm gonna take my Real
Techniques contour brush I'm just going
to line out to my contour and I just do
it really lightly because this bronzer
is very pigmented so I just put this
like underneath my bottom lip to make it
look a bit more pouty up on the tops of
my forehead and then I just blend blend
blend away because I love contouring
everything I did not use blush in this
video because I wanted the focus to be
mainly on the eyes and just bronzer but
that's what I used and then I went in
with my favorite liners and mascaras
like I said these will all be linked
below if you're interested and then all
I did was I went back in with Aphrodite
and I'm gonna put this with a pencil
brush on my lower lash line because I
really want this color to pop because
I'm so in love with it I think it just
should be the star of the show so I just
put that underneath my lower lashes and
then later on I'll go in with mascara
and put that on my bottom lashes as well
now tie for lips I'm taking a nude liner
this one's from Stila and it's called
inspiring and then for lipstick I'm
taking the Wet n Wild Fergie daily
lipstick I love this nude it's so so
gorgeous and it's not too nude at all
then I'm just going to top it off with a
NYX butter gloss and creme brulee and
you are done
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
again please like it if you enjoyed it
and I will see you all in my next video
bye
every second every moment I'm fighting
hell super through this heart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
