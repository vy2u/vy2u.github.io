a makeup tutorial and if you could tell
by my voice I'm pretty sick but I really
quickly want to show you guys palettes
I'll be using the first one is dear both
from women wild and the first one is
drinking a glass to shine the other one
I got is a sparkle till morning I just
feel like these two pallets go so well
together like I don't know just the
colors and everything they just they
deserve their own Z palette so these
will probably be deposit very very very
soon so I hope you guys enjoy this video
I'm going to go ahead and get off
because I'm out starting coughing a lot
I hope you all have a great Thanksgiving
and thank you so much for watching
I will see you guys in my next video bye
first thing I wanna do is apply
foundation I'm using Revlon Colorstay
in fresh beige and I'm applying this
with my f88 brush from Sigma after that
I'm applying my dermablend concealer in
sable and I'm just putting this on my
cheeks and excuse my voice for cracking
just then taking my Maybelline instant
age rewind concealer and light pale
doing a triangular motion underneath my
eyes and I'm going to blend it out with
a p88 brush just to help it into the
smaller corners of my eye and then I'm
gonna blend it out with a bigger tapered
brush which I can't remember the name
but I'll put it down below if you're
wondering
they're going on my makeup Forever's
super Matt loose powder I'm just going
to set my under eye concealer and my
face makeup then I'm taking the tapered
face brush and I'm going in with hoola
benefit bronzer I'm just going to apply
this and contour my face
then taking backsplash and warm soul and
a blush brush I'm just going to apply
this to my sheets now for the eyes are
going on with Max Paint Pot in soft
ochre which is my favorite primer then
I'm taking a flat shader brush and the
mac fix+ spray you can use water if you
want to and I'm just going to spray the
brush then i'm taking the sparkle to a
morning palette and i'm taking the
definer color and they're just going to
Pat this all over my lid
I feel like padding makes it a lot more
intense so that's what I like to do
then going on with a crease color from
the sparkle to morning palette I'm
taking the fluffy brush and I'm just
going to put this in my crease it'll
kind of help blend out that line to that
we just made
now going in with a smaller brush and
another spray this one as well taking
the brown color from the sparkle to
morning palette and I'm just going to
put this in the inner parts of my eye
and around my tear duct then I'm taking
a angled brush and I'm taking the crease
color from the drinking a glass of shine
palette which is on an all matte palette
this is sort of a reddish kind of deep
brown and I'm just going to apply this
on the outer corners of my eye just to
sort of deepen it up a bit
taking it a fluffy brush again I'm just
going to blend that out
they're taking this eyelid color with
that same fluffy brush I'm going to
apply this as my transition color so a
little bit above the crease color we
plated earlier
going in with that same color from the
sparkle morning palette that we used on
our inner corners this is going to be
our highlight and then I'm taking a
pencil brush in the crease color that we
use with the all matte palette from
drinking a glass of shine I'm going to
apply this underneath my lower lashes
then taking this awesome new liner I'm
loving the Maybelline Life stiletto I'm
just going to wing out my liner also
going on with this L'Oreal hip liner the
pencil liner and I'm just going to line
my waterline now it's time to curl my
lashes the press and ice Kara first one
it's gonna be the covergirl clump
crusher mascara I love this one you guys
asked for a first impression but I've
been using it a lot lately and I love it
so if you're wondering that's what I
think about it
and then I'm taking the l'oreal collagen
effuse mascara flying that next and then
my cult favorite the covergirl lash
perfection mascara to help separate and
lengthen my lashes and this will also be
my bottom lash mascara
and then applying cream cup from Mac and
I'm just going to apply a Revlon lip
gloss on top I think it's called peach
petal I'll put the name down below but
that's pretty much it I hope you guys
enjoy this video sorry for my sick stick
voice again I will see you guys later
