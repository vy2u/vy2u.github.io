fashion haul i purchased a few things
these past couple weeks and i want to
show you guys what I got if you're
wondering where this shirt is from i
will tell you just stay tuned for it but
i'm going to go ahead and start with
nastygal.com it's one of my favorite
clothing sites ever it is war on the
pricey side but I just I'm so in love
with us I like seriously i'ma love the
first thing is what you guys saw in my
back to school outfit idea video and
also I plan on doing a fall lookbook
very very very soon I can't wait I'm
going to be incorporating a lot of
pieces i'm showing you and some other
things that have to go pick up and stuff
but i think in like September I'll put
that up but I'm so excited to film it I
just oh I can't wait I love fall but
this is the first top from nasty gal so
just has sort of this tank top strap at
the top and it also has the cold
shoulder detail on the sleeves so just
looks like this sort of that seafoam
color and it has the sharkbite bottom
and then the back just looks like this
with a deep v and then the little strap
in the middle as well which I love so I
got that by the way these are all and as
I small the next thing I got was this
really cute collar top like I've seen a
ton of color tops with cutouts in the
front they're super trendy right now and
I'm missing just everywhere but I got
this one that has the color sort of
wrapped around the neck and it just
buttons it has a really deep v in the
front but for me it's not too revealing
at all but just the deep v in the front
and it is long sleeves and it also has
the high-low detail you can't really see
it on this like me holding it up but it
has a really nice high-low detail on it
and then the back just also has pretty
much the same cut out just showing a
little bit of skin and I'm sorry these 2
i'm about to show you were so wrinkly i
like recently just got them so by the
way you'll be seeing a lot of cream and
wipes and stuff whoever said you can't
wear white after Labor Day is completely
crazy because I were white tops all the
time after labor day like I don't even
care at all and I I mean I don't wear
like white pants or white shoes but I
will wear white tops because I think
they're cute and
it's just how I like it but I got this
top also it's just the lace shoulders
and it has a really nice be in the front
so pretty this shirt is just gorgeous it
also has like it's a little bit tight
around the arms right here so it kind of
puffs up a little bit and it's just a
basic kind of taught but it's super cute
really nicely made and then the last
time i got from nasty gal is this one it
just has the lace detailing on the
shoulders and it's more cream than white
and it just has the rap detailing with a
deep v in the front and then the back
just has sort of an open back like this
goes all the way down and wraps around
the back as well so really love those
tops I cannot wait to buy some more and
in the next place is boohoo.com i
actually just purchased some more stuff
from them like for cardigans at a really
cute top but it takes 14 business days
for them to get to me and I'm in Georgia
if you guys don't know so it takes a
long time with shipping because I think
they're like in the UK or something like
that I'm not too positive x know they're
overseas so it takes a while for
shipping if you're in the US but it's
really worth it because I love their
stuff the first thing I want to show you
is just this little black bandeau
nothing too crazy it's just in a medium
large and then I got this American flag
pando because I just thought of fourth
of July and I didn't know when I'd ever
see this again so I just got to say
medium large as well and I thought it'd
be super super cute and then this is the
top that you guys have been asking so
many questions about I born in my August
favorites video I got it in two colors
cuz they loved it so much so I got it in
a small medium both of them because
that's what they come in and it just
looks like this is a really nice black
one and it has sort of embellishments on
the uncertain skull so it's really cute
the little rhinestones it's a pretty
long top again with a high low and it's
just super cute I can't wait to show you
guys how I'm going to pair this and then
like I said I got another color which is
this kind of cream off white color just
look like this the same detailing same
high low super cute
and love them so that's that and then
from hope look I did I've been
purchasing a ton of things from
hautelook lately like I've been obsessed
with the site incredibly um I will put
it down below if you don't know what I'm
talking about i've talked about it a ton
of times of videos especially in halls
but i actually purchased my first pair
of combat boots from them and i am so
impressed so happy i'm just in love with
them i kind of wish i would have bought
more colors but I knew I'd get more use
out of the black so these are the combat
boots that I got they were on a few
weeks ago and as you guys know if you
know how hautelook works they don't have
these on right now because the sale
ended like it takes like three days or
four days I think but this is what they
look like they just have the buckles at
the top and then they also have a zipper
opening and then just the little laces
in the front I love these I felt like
they weren't too edgy or anything like
that they're just super cute they're
going to go with everything and they
were only like thirty five dollars which
was a steel freaking steel so absolutely
love them I got them in a size eight and
I do run true to size and if you're
wondering the brand is what's the brand
gr vo ve so whatever that is that's what
that's the brand ok so next is toby and
toby is a site where they get new things
every day and the new items that they
get our thirty percent off on their site
um I think it lasts for about two days
or so and then they go to regular retail
price but I love that site and if you
sign up through your Facebook you get
fifty percent off your first order not
just one shirt your whole order so I
thought that was amazing that's what
actually drew me into it so i'll put a
link down below as well so of course
this top is from toby kind of has the
chick cage detail on the shoulders i
really love it has a really deep V and
it kind of falls off my shoulders a
little bit but it's ok i'm working with
it and it also has like a really nice V
in the back check out that tag I'm still
wearing support for this video its high
low so its of course shorter in the
front long in the back so
there is that if you can see I don't
know if you can but really great quality
the fabric is kind of heavy which I
actually like because it's nice and
thick and you don't really have to wear
a tank top underneath it or anything so
I love it it's so pretty I actually saw
Kim four mil Housewives of Beverly Hills
wear shirt that was kind of like this it
wasn't exactly like it she had like a
blue silky one or whatever but ever
since I saw her wear it um on one of the
episodes I was like I need a shirt like
that and I saw this and I was like yes
the next thing I got you guys have seen
this too in my time video ten things I
would repurchase it's just like this
little sherbert color top buttons all
the way down is like the chiffon type
material as well and it has the two
pockets in the front so I thought it was
cute it's just a nice little basic shirt
to have and then I also got this top I'm
obsessed with cold shoulders anything
like shoulder detailing arm detailing
I'm obsessed with um so there's this one
it has a V in the front like I said the
cold shoulder with the black straps and
it sort of pleated as well in the front
and it just kind of goes down and it's
just the off-white color so it's a cute
simple top I'm going to have to probably
tuck it into a pair of pants or whatever
but I really liked it it's cute and then
this blast thing I got an absolutely
love it it's just a 34 sleeve button
down so it looks like this it just has
the dip dye effect to a really nice dark
grey color and it's really long so it
covers your butt and I thought this be
so cute like leggings and boots in the
fall it's just something easy to throw
on and it looks like you kind of put
some effort into it but you really
didn't so I'm obsessed with this I can't
wait to wear it it's just super super
super cute so that's pretty much it i
hope you guys enjoyed this video like it
if you like halls or like this video in
general and i will keep doing them and i
will see you guys in my next video bye
