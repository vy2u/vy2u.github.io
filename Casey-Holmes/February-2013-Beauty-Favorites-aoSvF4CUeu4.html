my February favorites now I know I
haven't filmed in a while if you don't
follow me on Twitter Facebook and stuff
like that I have moved and what are you
furniture and a new vanity and all that
to go in here so I'm very excited to get
it taken care of and get it set up
I need more storage like ASAP maybe nuts
go ahead do it February favorites for
you guys so the first thing is this EES
pearl anti-shine and mattifying gel and
this is what it looks like
I absolutely love this if you have oily
skin this is something you're going to
want to try out especially during the
spring and summer when it starts getting
a little bit warmer and then your oily
skin just starts getting even worse
that's when you want to try this product
it is so awesome and keeping you matte
out put this in my t-zone I don't put it
all over my face because it is a
magnifying gel no lie this thing will
make you so mad the moment you put on
your skin you can just feel it
drying into your skin and it's just like
it's insane but it works so well it just
wonders and I highly recommend this if
you have very oily skin the next product
is a blush this is a Mac mineralize
skinfinish this isn't stereo rose and
this was alone in addition I absolutely
love this blush my all-time favorite at
the moment I haven't been using anything
else other than this one it's just
gorgeous on the skin and I think it's
gonna look even better
and there's summertime with the tan I
heard there is the Milani Duke for it I
have to go find out what that is but I
heard there was a dupe for this so we'll
see about that
next is a bronzer now I know I mentioned
this all the time but seriously I have
to include a favorites video this is
actually been the only bronzer I've used
for the past few months and it's the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I'm so
surprised I have not yet paid on this
highly recommended if you're in the
market for a high-end bronzer next
favorite I'm going to show you two
powders one streps or one tie-in
this is the Revlon nearly naked powder I
know if none of you've heard about this
I have the one in medium and I actually
show this in my current drugstore
favorites but I had to shout this one
out because I think it's a really great
powder it's superfine very comparable to
a high-end powder and I really really
truly love this so definitely check that
out for interested for the high end
powder I've been using my NARS powder
this is in beach and it's a lighter
powder but I like to use this like in
the center parts of my face and just
have like a really nice texture to it it
doesn't make you look cakey all or
nothing anything like that I still need
to go pick up mountain because Mountain
needs to be like went all-time favorite
powder ever don't far been loving beach
I needed to use it so just been using it
in the center of the face and it's been
working great for me next I have this
mac lipglass you can't really see like
the Mac name on it anymore cuz it's
rubbed off this has been floor by this
and it's what I have on my lips right
now it's actually the only thing I have
on my lips right now and it's just a
really pretty nude color it's not too
nude but it's just gorgeous so that's a
swatch of it oh that's a swatch bit
right there it's just really pretty on
its own on the top of the lipstick I
mean it's just gorgeous next thing this
is another product I mentioned in my
drugstore favorites but I have to shout
this out at my monthly favorites because
I use it all the time so covergirl and
Olay simply ages corrector it just has a
swirl of the corrector and then the Olay
moisturizer and it's awesome never looks
cakey underneath the eyes covers
amazingly highly recommended product
alright two pallets I've used a time
during this month is the lorac Pro
palette and the Naked palette now from
The Naked palette I've been using naked
and buff which is these two matte shades
right there I've been on a matte
eyeshadow kit I haven't been using
shimmery eyeshadows at all and from the
lorac Pro palette I've been using cream
and that's a really pretty highlight
color and
I have been using sable so those two
right there
I've used a lot as well sorry if I
blinded you with the mirror also last
makeup product I have been loving the
bomb bomb shelter tinted moisturizer
this is a medium I got this off of
HauteLook and I got other a bunch of
other stuff from the bomb on there as
well but I really like this I love to
use tinted moisturizers BB cream
anything like that I love to use those
type of products for work because I'm
not the type to get up and always put
foundation on in the morning I'm just
too lazy so these products are off them
and I really like this one it has SPF 18
in it and it doesn't even on my skin
tone pretty well so the bomb bomb
shelter tinted moisturizer okay next is
two hair products I have this macadamia
natural oil deep repair mask I have
actually used this up this month there's
just like an itty-bitty tiny bit left
just at the bottom but I've used this
all up it's my favorite mask actually
recently this morning tried a drugstore
mask and way down my hair so bad I
didn't like it at all so definitely pick
this one back up because it's so good at
just keeping your hair healthy and not
making it way down and feel like it has
so much product in it that you have all
this product build up the can even blow
dry your hair that's like the worst
feeling to me when I feel like after I
wash my hair and I get out of the shower
and I have like product build-up it
irritates me so bad but this never ever
ever did that and it really made my hair
super healthy so I highly recommend the
deep repair masks from macadamia another
product that I really really recommend
is the new me argan oil I mentioned this
in my heart keep my hair shiny and
healthy and all that I'll put that video
down below if you're interested I use
about less than a dime size amount and
it's perfect every time I get out of the
shower this always goes in my hair and
it's just awesome and if you don't know
I do have a coupon for it if you want it
down below 20 bucks it's originally 60 I
think last thing is a skincare product
and
right onto my simple face wash that I
used when I filmed my skincare routine
and when I went to go pick it up they
didn't have it so I decided to try this
one out so Olay fresh effects
shine shine go away shine minimizing
cleanser a lot of shines in that but
this is what looks like I'm about
halfway through this bottle and I really
actually loved it it hit my skin really
clear I'm not gonna say it kept me like
shine free it's really nice it doesn't
make my skin even more oily every time I
wash my face I use this so highly
recommend this one is kind my skin super
clear and it's just awesome
so those are all my favorites for the
month I hope you guys enjoyed this video
