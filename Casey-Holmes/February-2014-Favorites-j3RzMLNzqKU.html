my February favorites and I'm going to
show you guys a few of my favorites and
then I have a surprise giveaway at the
end so just stay tuned for that first
thing I want to talk about our primers I
have been using these two primers this
one all month and this one I've been
using for a little over a month
the first one is high-end this is the
Smashbox photo mat anti-shine primer and
I really do like this a lot it keeps me
very nice and matte and then this one is
from Target this is a number 7
beautifully matte makeup base and a lot
of you recommended this to me and I've
been really enjoying it as well
sometimes I feel like this gives me
white flakes on my face but it's not bad
you know if I just Pat it into my skin
but both of these are great I think it's
just personal preference on which one
you want to try okay next I really
quickly just want to shout out my Estee
Lauder Double Wear foundation I have
been using this non-stop this month and
I'm just seriously obsessed with it I
cannot get enough of this foundation
it's just so good
a lot of you asking me in my last video
what pump I had on this and this is the
Mac pump just the Mac foundation pumps
you can get them for I think about 6 or
7 bucks at Mac but it fits perfectly on
top of these so yeah I love this you
should definitely check it out my
favorite way to apply it is with my
Sigma f80 brush and I used the Beauty
Blender but I just feel like it really
busts into the skin nicely with this
foundation brush ok next I want to tell
you guys about two of my new favorite
brow products the first one is this
Tarte Amazonian clay waterproof brow
mousse in taupe actually I have one in
medium brown this is the old packaging
and then this is the new packaging right
here but I got the color taupe because
medium brown is a little bit too dark
for me and I really like the consistency
of these brown OSes I've talked about
the medium brown one quite a bit on my
channel in the past but yeah taupe is
definitely my favorite I have it on my
brows today it just goes really well
with my lighter hair color you know with
the ombre so been loving that and then
so I've been loving this honest Asya
medium ash medium brow powder but just
want a quick eyebrow look I will go to
this one just fill in most of my brow
with the darker shade and then the inner
part of my brow with the lighter shade
and it's perfect I got this in a set at
Ulta it came with this brow powder duo
spoolie and a brush duo and then also
came with a clear brow gel and that's
just kind of like my go-to quick easy
brow looks next is a mascara this is the
Too Faced better than sex mascara this
is the example size I did a first
impression on this so I'll link that
down below if you guys want to check it
out but I've been really loving this for
the days that I don't want to wear false
lashes I will go to this mascara because
it really makes my lashes look nice and
full and I have no issues with this to
me it doesn't flake on me I know a lot
of comments in that video we're asking
if it flaked it didn't flake on me and I
had no problem taking it off so I love
this I love it so much that I even
bought a full size just waiting to be
used but this is definitely one of my
favorite mascaras if I'm not gonna wear
false lashes next I just want to quickly
mention my whitening lightening lip
gloss in nude I've been using this so
much and no matter where I go I take
this with me because I just love it it
has a mirror on the end and then you
also get the little light but the main
reason why I love it is just because of
the color and I know I mentioned this in
my last favorites video but I really
truly love it I think it's the perfect
nude lip gloss I'll have a link below
with some discounts if you're interested
but I love this lip gloss I'm telling
you it is amazing you should definitely
check it out next up is a new bronzer
this is a Dior skin new tan in cinnamon
and I've been really enjoying this
bronzer a lot I've been eyeing it for a
really long time and I finally went and
purchased it not too long ago it is a
very warm bronzer it's not too orange
because I like to contour with this I
think it looks really beautiful and it
just kind of bronzes up the skin as well
but I think this is great for me I can
definitely either bronze my skin up with
it or contour it doesn't have some
shimmer in it but you can't tell when
it's on your face and this blends out so
beautifully I would definitely recommend
checking out the Dior bronzers if you're
willing to spend them
the packaging is beautiful and the
product is awesome as well okay next is
another Dior product I splurged on these
two items this month but this is a Dior
shimmer powder and amber diamond and I
cannot find this anywhere online like
literally I have searched high and low
for this and I can't find anywhere I
even ordered it off lavaca C but I've
not gotten it in the mail at all so I
don't know what the deal is with that
but yeah I really love this it's a
beautiful highlighter I went to
Bloomingdale's and they had the Dior
counter in there that's where I found
this so I would definitely recommend
checking out a Dior counter and it's not
one of those highlighters I was like BAM
in your face it just makes you look like
you have a nice glow to your skin and it
looks really really beautiful okay next
up is a perfume this is by Gucci and
it's flora by Gucci and I'm obsessed
with this this smells so good you guys
it's like floral but it's so clean and
fresh it just smells so good I don't
think I've been this excited about a
perfume in a really long time I just I'm
a blood I'm in love with it you guys
have to check this out it's the floor of
Gucci with the light blue liquid I don't
know if you can tell on camera but it's
the light blue liquid and it is so
stunning I'll have a link for it below
if you're interested last for so long
and I'm just
oh I'm obsessed of it you have to check
this out okay next up is this beauty
blender cleanser solid and when I first
got this I was like I don't know about
this because I thought was kind of
difficult at first but once I got used
to just swirling my brushes in this and
then rinsing them off I'm up steps with
this like literally it makes washing
your brushes so much easier all you do
is you just take this little guy you can
see mine's like hitting the little pan
or whatever but you take this and then
you take your brush and you make sure
it's wet first and then just kind of
swirl it around in here and then rinse
it off on the back your hand and
literally your brushes are so clean I
usually use Dawn dish detergent but ever
since I went to this I won't go back to
that because I just find this to be
easier okay next thing I want to quickly
shout out my nume megastar I love this I
was without it for a long time because
my last one I stepped on it and broke it
so when I finally got this in the mail
this month I was seriously so excited
and I've also been using another hair
dryer from them then I'm just loving so
you guys will see that in my morning
routine very soon but I'm telling you if
you need a new straightener this is the
way to go I used to have the black one
but I have the purple one now and I
think it's so pretty
I do have pretty straight hair after I
blow-dry it and this straightens my hair
really nicely of course it's what I use
today but I've had people tweet me with
really curly thick hair letting me know
that they absolutely love this because
it cuts their time in half from
strengthening their hair because I've
had some friends who have really curly
hair and I know it's definitely
difficult for them to you know get their
hair done in a timely manner I mean this
is perfect for everybody like I think it
works so well and I do have a coupon
code for you guys for a hundred and
twenty dollars off so I would definitely
check this out so this is the next item
this is actually the last item for my
favorites video and I actually posted a
picture of this on Twitter it is this
organizer that I purchased from
Marshalls I thought it was about six or
seven dollars but it went back to get
two more and there were twenty dollars a
piece so they're a little bit pricey but
I think they're super cute so basically
what you get is this one big slot right
here like in this one I have all my
Beauty blenders here and then behind it
you get for individual slots and I love
it because it's all acrylic and you can
see that my brushes are divided up
between like eye brushes and then my
face brushes and for this one that I was
just showing you I have this section in
the front so I have extra lip stuff some
mascara samples lip glosses and liners
and then in the back here I just have
some palettes that I have sent up on
this drawer of here which if you've seen
my makeup collection you probably know
what I'm talking about but I just put
them all back in here and it holds a lot
of stuff I have four of these things now
and I just I love the way they look and
they make things look so much more clean
and neat and I love that and love
organization okay so this month I
definitely want to do a small giveaway
