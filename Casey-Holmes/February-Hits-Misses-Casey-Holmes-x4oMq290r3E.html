with you my favorites for the month of
February and I was kind of like on the
fence of doing these because I feel like
a favorites videos and get kind of
repetitive but I figured I would do a
February hits and misses for you guys so
you can see some of the products that I
really wasn't feeling and then the
products that I was really loving yeah
let's just go ahead and jump into the
video the first thing I want to talk
about is brushes and this one I actually
just recently it was actually in my last
video I showed this in my first
impressions video and I love it I've
been using it non-stop I might not have
used it all last month this is like a
new favorite I knew I loved this the
moment I used it it's a great bronzing
contouring brush it really does blend
out bronzer so well and in that video
you can kind of see when I do it but
when I go here on my cheeks it bronzes
that area and it also does a nice little
line without you even trying so it's a
great contouring and bronzing brush and
it is the cutest little thing and it is
by benefit if you guys are interested
and I would definitely recommend
snagging this up if you want this
someone also said that Real Techniques
has a dupe I think it's the blush brush
or something it has like this shape so
if you don't want to spend the money on
this then you can try out the Real
Techniques one and see how you like it
okay and then the next brush is this our
teeth brush I have been really liking
this brush just for a quick application
for pretty much any foundation and I
love this for like the Marc Jacobs one
and everything like that I actually have
a full review on this and demo if you
want to check it out I will leave the
video like right in here and I will also
leave it down below in the description
box as well but I really do like it this
is the artist oval-8 I use it strictly
for foundation in that one video I used
it for multiple things but I now like it
just for foundation I'm going to shout
out a couple pallets that I have been
using recently and the first one is the
mani MUA palette I love this palette I
just I have been using it so much it is
so pigmented
soare is my ish I love this color I love
Mars insomnia is one of my favorites as
well this whole palette is just
beautiful what's this highlight shade
called Artemis shade right here you guys
is the most beautiful brow bone
highlight
/ I love this color so much every color
in this palette is beautiful you can do
so many different looks with this I did
film a look with this the first time I
got it and there's just a lot of similar
looks so I decided to not upload it
because I just I figured I would do
something else but I loved it i've been
using it non-stop and these are so
pigmented i mean its makeup geek
eyeshadows they're great quality and I'm
so happy for me this is a beautiful
palette okay so the next one is this Too
Faced peanut butter palette and I love
it
I love this so these are the colors
right here does smell like peanut butter
you know Too Faced they're so cute they
make everything still delicious and you
just gonna eat everything but this is
what the inside looks like I will say
one thing the only thing I wish they had
in here was like a dark matte brown or
matte black something like that there's
a lot of shimmer in shades
I'm obsessed with this nuts about you
and peanut butter
these two are awesome to warm up any
look and then these highlight shades
over here beautiful extra creamy is
great to set all over the eyes this is
great to have a pop of color on the lash
line or all over the lid you could just
do a bunch of different fun colorful
looks with this palette and it's so
pigmented I don't think I've purchased
any Too Faced palettes like these
smaller ones but they did send this to
me in PR and I've been using it so much
I mean I I just love it and I think it's
super fun for summer okay and then this
palette is the one I've actually been
mixing with that one as well and I
really love this if you caught with all
matte palette I will probably be
obsessed with it just because I love
matte eyeshadows so this is from the
balm it's the neat matrimony and guys
first off these shadows are huge these
are what I have on my eyes today they
are huge so pigmented let me show you
look at that that's a transition shape
they are just absolutely stunning
and I love the different colors that
they have in here you have some cool
tones and some warm toned eyeshadows
they are just stunning this black is
black you see that there is no skin
showing through underneath that black it
is so intense
but these are great they blend really
well and they last such
long time on your eyes I have been using
this so much I look I mean it's the
perfect palette you have your creams you
have great transition colors a little
bit of color in there your black I mean
this is perfect okay the next thing is
something that I recently got you'll see
it in a whole maybe this week or next
thing I've been pre filming a lot for
you guys but I love this this is like
one of those things you're gonna know
you love right when you use it and this
is the Sephora color switched by Vera
Mona and it says it instantly removes
shadow bubbles off from your makeup
brushes and it does whenever I'm doing
my makeup and I just want to take that
color off really quickly and use a
different shade on my eyes this is
perfect because it takes all of that
excess color off and you can use the
same brush for a different color it is
amazing not gonna lie I was super
skeptical skeptical not gonna lie I was
super skeptical not gonna lie I was
super acceptable oh my god I was really
skeptical about this but you guys it
freakin works also once you quickly
shout out this eyeliner this is the
makeup forever ink eyeliner it's a matte
liquid liner if you've been following me
for a while you know that I am obsessed
with this but recently I just got a
brand new one and the pigment I forgot
because I have been using mine for a
while and it was like drying out
I forgot how freakin intense this
eyeliner is it's what I have on my eyes
today and in my last video and the
eyeliner just slays it is so crisp it is
so black it is so matte and it looks
clean and just perfect I love I love
this eyeliner there's nothing I can say
bad about it
it lasts all day long and it just looks
so good okay really quick I'm gonna talk
about some lip products first off these
dose of colors liquid lipsticks I love I
like them a lot I will say they can get
a little drying but sometimes when it
gets to that point I'll just put a
little gloss over top but I love the
colors so the colors I've been using is
this one which is desert suede which is
a really pretty topi mauve color I love
the doe foot applicator on these you
guys it just fits your Cupid's bow and
everything perfectly
helps you over line your lips a little
bit and it's just so easy to do fun is
another one of my favorites this is in
mood I actually showed this on my
Instagram and had it in my NARS review
video so beautiful they last such a long
time like I said the only thing is they
can be a little drying but it's not a
huge deal it is a liquid lipstick so
it's going to be more matte and a little
more drying than a regular lipstick but
when it gets to that point where I feel
like it's uncomfortable I just put a
little gloss on and I'll be good to go
speaking of gloss I have been obsessed
with buxom lip glosses I was not happy
with these when I first tried them out a
few years ago I just didn't like them
but lately I think I'm just getting used
to these lip glosses now and I really
love them the thing that I didn't like
about them was the minty feeling that
they gave but now I love it I am
obsessed I love the way it makes my lips
look and it lasts for such a long time
so the colors I've been using the most
are peach daiquiri Bellini and hottie
Tottie I've hotty totty right now over
top of this Stila liquid lipstick in
caramel oh oh so good I love these so
much they're beautiful okay now I have
some skincare favorites I want to
quickly mention to you guys the first
one I believe I don't know if I've
mentioned this in a favorites video I
think I've talked about it somewhere but
this is a Kate Somerville exfoli Kate
intensive exfoliating treatment this is
amazing it is so incredibly pricey but
it is worth every penny I have never
found an exfoliator I loved as much as I
loved this one like it is perfection and
I also like to use this on my back my
back tends to break out a lot and this
has made everything so much better like
I haven't had a breakout at all on my
back looks really smooth the skin is
really refreshed when I put this on my
face it feels like I've gone to a spa
and somebody's just putting this
amazingness on me and getting all that
dead skin off and my skin is so smooth
afterwards and makeup just glides on I
cannot say enough good things about this
you've got to check it out if you're
looking for an exfoliator okay and then
the last skin care product is actually
this little guy isn't it so cute this is
the Clarisonic Mia
fit and I have been really liking this I
don't use this every single night but I
do use this when I feel like I want a
deep clean so the first setting is
gentle setting and then you could do
another pump for a more intense clean
but I just do the first one because I do
have sensitive skin and this is just
perfect it I was really nervous about
trying it because I didn't like my first
Clarisonic but I really do love this one
it is so nice my skin feels so clean and
refreshed and it looks so good after I'm
done cleaning it with this okay so
moving on to the products that were
missus from me this month the first one
is by touch'
and I include this in a haul a while
back but it's itachi pure one-step
Camila cleansing oil I use the Clinique
cleanse off balm it's so good now when I
got this I don't know I had high hopes
for it I just thought I would really
like it because I love cleanse off oils
and taking off all that makeup
something about man oils we just don't
get along for my face but I felt like I
had to use a ton of this product to get
all my makeup off and it took me forever
to get my makeup off as well I feel like
I could just take my cleanse off balm
put it in my hands and it takes off all
of my cake face makeup that I have on
and it's perfect this I feel like I just
have to use a lot for the price and I
feel like I would run out of it really
quickly and it just didn't take
everything off the first time around
like I wanted it to so I was just a
little disappointed in this and I don't
feel like it's worth the money for me so
for me this is a myth I know people
really love this brand but I'm sorry it
didn't work for me this is a product
that I just feel like it's not worth the
money again
because I have something else that's
better and I feel like moisturizes my
legs a lot better and just my body in
general and this is again the touch of
indigo soothing silk body butter there's
nothing wrong with this I do feel like
it moisturizes really well but I feel
like my luck seat on ultra rich body
cream like makes me so blowy so
moisturize and it lasts a lot longer
than this this just kind of feels like a
regular lotion to me which for the price
I feel like it should be just as good if
not better than my LOC seat on which
it's not so this is going to be going
back
is what it looks like it's really thick
it's cool that it's blue but yeah just
it's not one of my favorite so I was
unfortunately I'm miss for me and then
the last mist is something you guys have
been asking me about so much and I'm
like on the fence about this one this is
the bozhe white charcoal mattifying
setting spray I do think that this is
really nice to spray at the end of your
makeup - like modify your face but I
don't feel like it keeps me shine free
for a really long time I just it's not
something I gravitate towards I love my
Smashbox photo finish primer water and
before I had tried that I was like
against setting sprays and stuff because
I was like there's no way that's gonna
work I even thought that Smashbox primer
water wasn't going to work I had no
hopes for it and I've gone through
almost 5 bottles of them so it's like
one of those things where I'm gonna know
if I like it or not and I know if I'm
gonna use it a lot but this is just
something that I'm I just I don't like
it it just wasn't worth the money for me
and I love bow shows I'm really sad I
don't like this but it's not that I
don't like it it's just that I don't
feel like it works for a long period of
time and I have very oily skin and my
work for other people but it just didn't
work for me so yeah sorry I'm so bad I'm
like I'm sorry do they work for me but
that's life right just not gonna work
for everybody so that is it guys it for
this video I hope you enjoyed it don't
