bag opening I've never had a glam bag
with was my first one so I'm excited to
do it
and if you don't know what it is it's
basically like a monthly subscription
it's like ten dollars a month and they
send you some products and stuff to try
out and just some little goodies so it
comes in a little bag like this nice
cute little packaging and I already took
the cards out and then I have the bag
right here just has like this NYX card
it has a 30% coupon on the back of it
then you get the top beauty trend like
just kind of information cards and stuff
so there's that really cool and then you
get a little note and then on the back
it's just the list of products that you
get so that's that so we're gonna go
ahead open it this is the bag I think
it's really cute it's definitely
Valentine's Day inspired and the first
thing I'm gonna get out is the excess
shine control oil free formula amazing I
am so excited about this let's what does
it say
steak flawless and shine frame with this
oil free moisturizer the mattifying
complex okay I have so like super super
super oily skin this is like amazing I'm
so happy to get this it's point zero
five or point seven point 75 fluid
ounces and it's actually a decent size
so I'm super excited I usually get tried
the Murad old control modifier but I
have to go buy the full size and it's
like thirty to forty dollars so it's
kind of expensive but I'm still excited
to try this this is amazing summer's
coming so I'm so thankful that they
included in the glam bag I need it so
bad
so thank you the next thing is these
Ghirardelli chocolates and it says dear
claim use here's a sweet surprise with
love from San Francisco enjoy these
decadent de lots and so it so my glam
team really cute
who doesn't love chocolate right mister
deli
and the next thing is in this little
pink pouch and premiere the premiere
dead see Cinderella mask it's luxury
skincare rich in life enhancing minerals
from the Dead Sea waters and you get a
premier eye cream eye premier instant
stretching and revitalizing masks so
that's pretty cool and then you get like
a little coupon code again for one of
their products so that is really cool
and let's see is this this dinner
illamasqua think it is it says yes it is
it's um Cinderella was magically
transformed for the ball or she met her
prince charming but she had to be home
for my not when she would transform back
apply the masks before your next date or
Valentine's Day and watch your skin
transform wrinkles become firmer and
fine lines instantly Totten best of all
it lasts 12 hours so feel free stay out
past midnight oh my god that's too cute
is it not if this really works I just
might go buy the full size because it
gives you a 50% off coupon in here so
that is amazing oh I'm super excited
that out I'm really into skincare lately
so I'm definitely looking for something
to kind of just you know go with my skin
so I'm really excited about that the
next thing is this new me hundred gift
card I did see this in someone's picture
of their bag and I was like her name is
the a Tabitha her link down below she's
super sweet and I was like oh my god is
that for real like that can't be true
you're paying $10 for this bag and
you're getting a hundred left gift card
and it's so true it says um enjoy 100 or
towards new Me's products hair tools
that will revolutionize your everyday
look so I'm so excited about this I
really wanted the Pearl and after seeing
level Mellisa Michelle's tutorial of it
I was like I have to have that so did
the between that or the tapered curling
iron so either between those two but I
think this is amazing and such a great
deal so yeah thanks new me and my
next is this in my ex roll on shimmer
eyes face and body and it's in seafoam
and it's really pretty that's the color
payoff oh my gosh it's really pretty I'm
not big on colors on my eyes like blues
and purples and stuff like that I just
I'm more of a neutral kind of girl but
that is brilliant and maybe this will
even be pretty as like a bottom liner or
something like you know a little eye
shadow underneath your bottom lash line
it might be really pretty so this is
really nice and it also says NYX is a
brand new intensely rent rich shimmering
powder that can be applied to the eyes
face and body don't think out applies to
my body probably more of my eyes but
very pretty I like that seafoam color
really cute then the last thing is this
Freeman feeling beautiful facial
hydrating mask goji berry um and since
the hydrates and smoothes on it says
turn your date night prep time into a
soothing small experience with this easy
to use skin perfecting mask so I'm
excited to try this like I said earlier
I'm really into my skincare right now
trying to find the perfect stuff for me
and I'm super excited to try this out so
yeah I really love all the stuff that
came in the glam bag I mean it's just
this whole glam bag was just well over
$100 with just the gift card loan so I
really love I'm so impressed with it I
