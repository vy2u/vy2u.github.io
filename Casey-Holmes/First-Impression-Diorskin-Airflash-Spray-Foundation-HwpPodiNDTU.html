a first impression on a new foundation
that I purchased recently this was
definitely on the pricey side and I
thought I've just been super interested
in it I've heard a bunch of different
things about it good and bad heard it's
great oily skin that lasts all day so I
wanted to try and it is the dior air
flash foundation this was $62 I believe
which is a really huge you know amount
and this is just the bottle that it
comes in really sleek gorgeous says it
is extremely flammable so no fire around
this please the color the girl matched
me in was number 300 and it's just a
spray foundation of course I've heard a
bunch of people say don't spray directly
on your face which I won't do I haven't
really seen any detailed reviews about
this like people applying so I'm not
sure what brush I want to apply it with
yet but I don't know I'm gonna wing it
and see I'm not sure but basically said
just an instant spray on face makeup
err a sensation of freshness and
lightness bubble blob so it's supposed
to feel really light on this skin and
give you kind of like a flawless finish
so I'm just going to shake it up and get
right into it
I'm really excited about it I did get
color matched but I didn't like apply it
myself so I don't know how it's gonna
look and you really don't know what
brush I'm gonna use I guess I'll take
this Real Techniques brush it's kind of
like a dentist brush but then again it
blends out really well so I'm just going
to take it and spray it on the brush I
hope this doesn't make like a huge mess
in my room I'm going to just kind of
stipple it on Wow it covered out my
redness like right then was just a
little bit of product whoa might like
this which could be a bad thing by the
way I didn't wish dries and I have been
breaking out lately because I dig at the
Clarisonic so yeah but using that Wow
this really does look like your skin but
ten times better
Jevon you can't spray
on your face that would be still
convenient and the lady said exa for
that you could build this up Wow it
literally doesn't look like a wearing
foundation let's just do one side of the
face you see how it looks
so look at the difference you see this
side I have my redness and everything
and then this side it looks really
natural and actually really nice I like
it I do see that some of my redness is
peeking through but it's really not bad
like I love how natural it looks I think
this is going to be a new fate so see my
redness we're just gonna cover that baby
up look at that oh my gosh might be a
bad thing then I tried this out cut now
I'm gonna have to keep using it and keep
repurchasing it I do kind of feel like
it's one of those things you're gonna
have to figure out which way you like to
apply it this with just experimenting
but so far with the real technique
brushes like it so that's what the
foundation looks like with just the
foundation on you could tell it
definitely covered up my redness and it
actually just looks like my skin but a
lot better I'm actually really really
impressed by this and I can't wait to
pull my face the rest my face makeup on
and see exactly how it looks with
everything else but so far I'm liking it
now let me go put on my makeup and I
will be right back okay so I've got my
powder blush bronzer and rice my makeup
on and concealer underneath my eyes I
didn't conceal any redness or anything
that I had on my face any breakouts and
I think it looks really good so far I'm
hoping it stays up to its claim of you
know wearing all day and not making me
look super shiny I think it really looks
good though it looks like my natural
skin and I'm just kind of already in
love with it I really improv my fingers
that it does what it says so yeah and I
did by the way said it with my makeup
forever super matte loose powder this is
a transparent natural shade and look
almost out of it again I'll be
purchasing a third one so I love this
stuff to set any makeup with okay so it
is now about four o'clock it's three
what is it 358 so I'm going to wear this
for a little bit I got some things I
have to do and we'll see how this lasts
throughout the day so it is now 721
and it's been like what four five six
three hours and I feel like the
Foundation's still on really well I do
feel a little bit shiny in my t-zone I
don't know if you can really tell I can
kind of tell the camera but I'm a little
shining my t-zone but my blush and
bronzer are still on just like the first
time I put it on still really pigmented
I haven't blotted or anything throughout
today after running errands and stuff
for a couple hours definitely think I
would have to go out with this
foundation but it still feels really
light and really go on the skin so I
still like it so far I'm used to
blotting anyways so it's not a really
huge deal for me but if you have really
oily skin and you want something to keep
you Matt for the complete day then I
would probably steer away from this one
because I am a little bit shiny hey guys
okay so it is now eleven o'clock I head
on for seven hours so my final thoughts
on this foundation is that it is a
really nice foundation it holds up very
well it's the reason why my blush and
bronzer is still on the only thing about
it is I am very oily in my t-zone which
if you have very oily skin like I do
it's kind of hard to find something
that's just not going to you know make
you Olli and stuff like that you know
normally you're gonna have to blot and
powder your face which I would have done
that a long time ago if I wasn't doing
this first impression but I honestly
really love it I think it looks great on
the skin it looked great in videos
because I filmed a couple videos today
so it looked really awesome and those I
think next time I'm going to use a
mattifying primer with it just see how I
like it and as far as repurchasing I
don't know if I repurchase it yet I
still have to kind of experiment more
with it and see how I like it but I'm
definitely keeping it because I love the
finish of it and I just think it looks
really nice on the skin and I personally
don't have a problem with blotting my
face with powder and stuff like that so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this first
impression please give it a thumbs up if
you want more thank you guys so much for
watching don't forget to subscribe and I
will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
