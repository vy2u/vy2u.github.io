be a first impression on the Jane
cosmetics this is a drugstore brand that
used to be out a long time ago but then
they quit making products and then
they've recently come back so I'm very
excited about it I did purchase all my
stuff from Ulta and at the time they did
have like this little bag I think it was
free with purchase for maybe thirty
dollars I can't exactly remember i'm not
going to do an update and when I after I
put its makeup on I just want to swatch
it see how it applies because I haven't
opened anything yet so it will just be
kind of like a first impression of what
I think of them the formula if they
blend out well also be applying them to
my face because the only thing I have on
my face right now its foundation because
I didn't get a foundation from them but
i will let you know in the description
box below like little i'll write out
little sentences of you know if it
lasted throughout the day ended up
looking blonde sheet now i'm going to
start with face products because they're
my favorite and i got to bronzers and a
blush the first bronzer is going to be
inspired thought this one will be great
to just warm up the skin tone not
necessarily contour with so at least it
looked like that online and it kind of
looks like that in person but first off
the packaging is so cute i just think
this is so sleek and i love like
packaging it's just so pretty and you
just slide this little guy off i think
right yeah it's just taped on there so
this doesn't come on packaging it just
looks like this which that's really nice
drugstore packaging I mean I feel like
that's I think that looks really good
also these products are pretty on the
pricey side for drugstore think these
are like eight or nine dollars so so
first watching it it looks really nice
it just looks like a nice bronzy shade
it looks a little like to just bronze
your skin with but it might work maybe
if you're more fair skin I don't know
but it feels really really soft it looks
like it blends out really nicely but it
is fairly you know light and they get
another bronzer this one's darker it's
called in power I got this one to
contour more the first one was Matt this
one
have a little bit of shimmer in it it's
not like overpowering but it's
definitely there these are pretty big
compacts they have point 35 ounces to
grams so this ones in power oh yeah
that's very dark very dark definitely a
contour shade i would not brought as a
whole face with this that's what what is
cool that's what empower looks like i
did get one blush this one's called
peach bouquets so there's peach bouquet
it's really cute has like little flowers
on it um and you just swirl them
together you get a really really pretty
shade whoo again very soft that's it
right there it's a pretty color I like
that so I'm going to be taking this
color this is the color inspire I just
want to see if it'll warm up my skin
tone and amazing my mac brushes are the
one I always use just going to apply it
because sometimes I feel like with
lighter bronzers you can be really
surprised like look I feel like that
looks really good it just warmed up my
skin tone the lighter bronze are like
this one or a benefit to love or Bobby
Brown's bronzer and golden light they're
light but once you apply them to your
skin it's like they do magic and I
really like this bronzer I feel like it
has applied some warmth to my skin I
like it I like it it doesn't look like
cakey or anything so it's not super
powdery I feel like this looks really
good it is light but it definitely warms
up the skin tone now to do more of a
contour I'm going to take the color in
power a brush them into you is the girl
Techniques contour brush just going to
kind of line out my contour it looks
really good i like both of these
together
yep I'm gonna like these
so for the bronzers I like them I like
them a lot I think they look very high
end and they blend really nicely they're
smooth love these so far now for blush
I'm going to take this one again the
peach bouquet how should I got my
brushes like all over here before I
found and let's see this is pretty
powdery has a lot of fallout but that's
okay but it has a pre color
I like it the bronzers in the blush look
really good what do you think I'm
telling you I like this packaging I mean
oh my god oh I forgot concealer oh I
should've done concealer first I totally
forgot about it I do have a concealer in
here this is in the color light you can
barely see that but it's in the color
light and it's in a squeezy tube I
totally forgot I had this in here I just
got too excited because i usually do get
very excited with bronzers and blushes I
like the squeezy too because I don't
like the wands um like with the spongy
tip on the Incas I feel like they're
really not sanitary but I feel like it
looks pretty good I can't believe I for
totally forgot about this
somehow blend all this haha but I do
like it I I don't think it likes settles
into fine lines to the point where you
can really see it but I just see the
lines of made my eyes I feel like it
just accentuates them a little bit more
more than my other concealers do but I
think it does look really good for a
drugstore concealer i bought two mats
and forge or three shimmers I'm sorry
let me go ahead and show you guys the
matte ones i bought the matte ones
because these are colors i would
definitely use cells called magnolia and
it's very pigmented i feel like this
would be great for a highlight I think
Matt highlights are always a necessity
so love that and then I dig at this one
which would be a transition color this
one is called natural and everybody
means a transition color in their
collection see what you look like yeah
as a nice color it's just a nice natural
shade it's a little bit lighter um then
most people would want to use for a
transition shade but I think if you're
one fair side this would be great for
you great great great we'll see how it
looks on the I so like I said things
always look different when it's on your
face so the three shimmer ones I got
were let's see called sunset does and
sweet basil and these are definitely
great ones for fall so this one's called
sunset whoo these are all pigmented I am
so excited about this Wow you see that
color ooh girl or or just I probably
should have unwrap these but this is
legit first impression right here this
one's called dusk
I can't get though these open I'm have
to redo my nail polish after this oh I
just jammed it crap let's see ooh dusk
is really pretty too oh my gosh you guys
these are so pigmented there's dusk oh
my gosh and then this one is sweet basil
which is a green which is when I
favorites right now a lot of you know
I've been loving green gold oranges
anything like that for fall so I had to
get a green color right again sweet
basil this one it I expect it to be
different this one's more of a I don't
explain it a more of a lime frosty green
I thought it's gonna be more of like a
forest green but it's more of a line
kind of color it's still pretty though
but it's not the color I expected it to
be so let's just get started and apply
some of these I'm going to take the
color natural first think it looks
really good does look natural it just
gives you that nice shading you want in
the crease so I do like this one feel
like i'll be using it a lot especially
to blend out colors in the crease and
have a nice transition shade so be
perfect and i think if you have lighter
skin you would really like this as well
i really like both of these colors but i
think i'm going to take this one I'm
going to take sunset and I'm just going
to pack this one all over the lid oh my
gosh these are so pigmented stunning
stunning stunning color they do have
quite a bit of fallout I might have
found a new brand I'm gonna love in the
drugstore like seriously is stunning
should have bought a matte brown and
then I'm going to go in with that
natural shade again and a smaller
blending brush just going to blend out
the edge of that sunset and focus it
more in the crease it's kind of do
all brushes i'm using will be in the
description box below as well oh my god
i love these colors going to take this
underneath my lower lashes and around my
tear duct i love these colors oh my god
they're so pretty and they blend really
great like blending off the edge of that
sunset is amazing it looks so good it
kind of blends in when I put natural
there it kind of just blends in with
natural and just oh oh I love it I love
a little of it now i'm taking magnolia
which is the creamy shade again with a
matte color since we have so much
shimmer going on that's just the perfect
highlight that's exactly what i like but
these are so pigmented so creamy oh my
god and i love sunset and natural on my
eyes already it's just a quick look that
took me like what five minutes to my eye
oh my god i love these and then I do
have liners I can't really use these
tubes they really won't go with the look
but I did get a green waterproof
eyeliner ok this is the in pain I'll
show you a swatch in the sidebar along
with this one this is a liquid water
resistant eyeliner it's called 14 karat
gold boo just really cute plain
packaging oh my gosh so creamy oh my
gosh let's see oh my gosh I love it the
let me pull about my lower waterline I
don't normally put black on my lower
waterline anymore but the sake of the
video I want to keep you guys updated in
the description box below if it smudges
or anything ok so I'm back and I depend
on my brows because I can't do my makeup
anymore with
have my brows on it just doesn't feel
right and my mascara and some lip gloss
I love everything I've tried today
seriously I think it's amazing the
colors are beautiful I think they apply
amazingly they have great pigmentation
