doing a first impression on the Mac
foundation this is the pro longwear now
if you saw my last video where I tried
to do this first impression it was way
too dark for me it was actually darker
than my body as well a lot of you were
saying I look liked it match but it was
completely darker it was just a totally
different color so I went back and the
girl matched me to NW 35 and I'm hoping
this one works out pretty well because I
really want to do this first impression
it would be awfully nice this is what it
looks like
I have just self-tan a couple days ago
and if you want to know what I used I
will link it down below I'm sorry I
sound weird I'm just really tired I'm
not a morning person at all I've heard
it's great for oily skin one fluid ounce
this was one thirty one dollars so yes I
kept the receipt just in case the color
really did not go well I love the fact
that it has a pump so I'm going to use
my Beauty Blender today and we're just
going to get right into it much better
hallelujah we've got a color going on
alright so you can see it is darker than
an actual face but this one matches my
body very very well thank the Lord and
you can see already that I have redness
over here but no redness over here
that's really nice it's covering up
amazingly and it's pretty easy to blend
out I could probably go down the shade
because um this is more of a just self
tan kind of color okay so this is just
the foundation I think it looks really
good color good job colors all pointless
time umm the color does work really well
with my body
nail I like its color a lot better and I
do have some redness peaking through
right here I did build up some more
color on there but I still see a little
bit right there maybe like a couple
blemishes so I might do some concealer
on that okay so I'm back and I have the
rest of my face makeup on and so far I
really do like the foundation with my
skin I
definitely have to let the foundation
sit for a few minutes and kind of you
know set it with powder and everything
like that to see how I'm really going to
like it because the foundation oh look
one way after like right when I put it
on and then they'll look different once
it sets into the skin and I really like
the way this one looks
I think it looks really nice it's not
too heavy and for a Mac foundation
that's pretty good
because sometimes matte foundations can
be pretty heavy I know the Studio Fix
was super heavy when I tried that out a
couple years back but I loved it so far
of course I said it with my transparent
powder from Make Up For Ever and I'll
put everything else I use on my face in
the bottom bar below and yes so it is
now 1033 I'm going to go ahead get
dressed and everything go do things for
a couple hours and I'll be back to
update you on the foundation hey guys so
I'm back for an update it is now 4:18 so
I've had this foundation on for a few
hours I'll put the exact amount right
here but I've had on for a few hours and
I still think it looks good I am just
very shiny in my t-zone this oil on my
face is really bothering me so I'm going
to blot on camera for you guys and read
powder so we can kind of see how it
lasts throughout the day after I've
blotted and repowered
what I'm going to use is mine your air
flash matte touch powder this is what
I'm going to touch up with and I'm just
taking regular tissue a lot of people
ask me when I blot with and I just love
with like little tissues or toilet paper
whatever's around and I just press it on
my skin now you could go get blotting
papers just use like tissue or toilet
paper you know it all does the same
thing so you can see all the oils and
nastiness coming off and like the oil
that was sitting on top of my skin was
it the kind that was annoying and I
could feel it all day it was like I was
surprised when I got in the car and saw
I had a shiny face cuz I didn't feel it
at all I didn't feel like it was getting
oily or anything because I didn't really
look in the mirror a lot today but when
I got the car I looked and I was like
what I'm so shiny you can use
Blayne dream matte powder um like this
one or whatever but I purchased it I was
using it I love it so I'm just gonna
press this into my t-zone I don't really
need to press it you know everywhere
else just mainly in the t-zone where I
get oily okay so we re powdered and like
I said I'm going to see how this last
throughout the day now and I do have
spin class a little bit later from now I
have it at about 7:00 and it's 4:30 now
so we'll see how it lasts through some
serious sweat because spin class always
makes me go crazy I sweat so much it's a
hard class but yeah we'll see how it
lasts throughout the rest of the day and
of course I'll be back to update you
guys in a little bit hey guys
so I just got back from spin class I
know it doesn't look like I sweat a lot
but trust me I sweat so much in spin
class if you've never taken it before
you really should try it out what do you
think I think it looks pretty damn good
for me sweating so much in my spin class
and they give you these towels they're
kind of like just wash towels you know
like the regular ones you could put like
in a guest bathroom and they give you
those to kind of wipe your sweat away
which I know people were looking at me
like I was crazy because I was wearing a
full face of makeup in there but I was
like I'm doing a YouTube video you just
don't understand I literally made that
towel another color because they give
you white ones so I was like oh wow this
is so embarrassing but let me just say
this foundation held up really well
throughout the sweat I mean a little bit
maybe came off the top of my forehead
but honestly it's not a big deal because
I just I know if I was out and about I
would not sweat as much as I did in spin
class and my final kind of conclusion on
it is you know I have very oily skin and
you guys saw that I did have to block
earlier but that's Daisy sorry but I
definitely feel like it's a great
foundation if you have super super oily
skin like I do you know that you know
most of the time you're just gonna have
to blonde tree power that's just life so
what you're gonna have to do so when you
have really oily skin I think which you
really look for is something that's
going to stay on your skin keep your
blush and bronzer on still going to look
great even when you do read powder it's
just going to stay put because you can
blot any powder and your foundation
should not you know come completely off
your face
shouldn't happen I really like this one
it's stay put you can see most of my
face products are still on and I've had
this for a long period of time I know
it's past eight because I get home from
spin at 8:00 so it's probably like 8:20
right now and this foundation has lasted
great all day I love it
only blotted and powdered up once and I
think it's just awesome I don't know if
it breaks me out because Mac is very
well known for breaking up people with
their foundations and everything but I
will definitely keep you guys updated on
if it does or doesn't enjoy this video
please thumbs up if you want more first
impression I have a drugstore foundation
that I want to do next but my next video
