on FIF update for the month of December
December with my super fast and I have
three products that I reviewed this
month I had the Revlon um BB cream and
my last five but that doesn't count
because I just now did it so I haven't
really been able to use it all month um
but the first one we're gonna talk about
that I did is the Revlon Colorstay
shadow stick this one is an atomic and I
still really like this product I noticed
though throughout using when using it
throughout the month that even when I
used to primer on is still kind of faded
throughout the day the same way it did
as if I didn't use a primer I mean it's
kind of weird but it definitely still
faded throughout the day and the color I
use the most is the gold but I like to
use this product
whenever I just want a quick eye look I
mean I still use it the same way just
put the gold all over the lid and put a
little bit of the green and the crease
and I just kind of blend it out with a
brush and you're good to go it's a super
easy I look and you don't necessarily
need a primer to make it lasts any
longer so you can skip the primer for
the day and just go with this because
you know it's gonna be sort of the same
effect and if you haven't seen this
video I will link it down below in the
bottom bar so this is a really quick eye
look it's not very long-lasting I would
say but it's good if you want something
quick just for a couple hours or
something like that so I recommend this
and like I said you don't really need a
primer because it there's not really a
huge difference using a primer and not
using a primer at least on my eyes I
have oily eyelids so it might be
different for you if you kind of have
different eyelids next is the amazing
Beauty Blender
I'm obsessed with this ever since I did
my for FIF video on this Beauty Blender
I have not touched a foundation brush
since like I said the video will be in
the downbar all the videos for the FIS
this month will be in the bottom bar but
I literally have not used my foundation
brushes ever since I did that video mine
is pretty dirty right now so please
excuse it but it's amazing I was
supposed to go and buy a dupe for this
intestinalis see if it was the same
but I actually I just got so hectic and
I totally forgot to do it but I will be
doing that this month in January so I'll
be sure to let you know probably in the
next SIF update video but this is
amazing it blends out foundations so
well and it literally makes your skin
look flawless
I'm not kidding when I say flawless like
I have not even used face concealer
since I've been using this product
because it just I mean the foundation
just covers a lot better with this
product I actually tried out this cover
will clean foundation with a brush and
the first time I ever tried it it was
more of a light to medium coverage with
that brush and I was like oh you know
it's nice but I don't know if I'll
really really like it or anything like
that I used it with the Beauty Blender
flawless medium to full coverage in an
instant I mean it was just beautiful and
my skin looked so satiny and nice and
just oh I loved it so this does do a
hell of a big difference with your
foundation I mean it's insane if you
have the chance to purchase this and try
it out I totally recommend it and if you
don't like it keep the receipt and
return it I know a lot of people are
like oh my god $35 for sponge it's not
just any sponge I mean it's the balm
sponge but you can also go on different
sites like Beauty joy calm cherry
cultured things like that and you can
get it for a cheaper price I've seen it
for $25 you also don't have to buy the
cleanser I will say that I did use the
Beauty Blender cleanser with this it
would have done the same thing as my
dawn dish detergent because that's what
I actually wash my brushes with is the
Dawn dish detergent and it just really
gets the liquid and everything out of
the sponge so just by these sponging and
I think it's like 20 bucks just to
purchase this by itself like on cherry
culture or something like that and I
think it's like 25 at Sephora but just
buy this and use your dish detergent and
they'll be fine
I mean you can save money in certain
places and I feel like that's why these
videos are so helpful because you know
like I just told you you don't have to
get the cleanser I just purchased it
because I didn't know if there was a
difference with it and there really
really isn't that's what I see on the
Beauty Blender I freaking love it the
last product I want to talk to you guys
about which has been a total
controversial parodic on my
FIF video it's team Maybelline rocket
mascara this is what it looks like
honestly it was a little clumpy but I
still love the mask girl I mean when I
said apply one coat I should have said
apply one application because that's how
I apply my mascara I like to fully coat
all of my lashes and then go in for a
second coat that's just how I do my
lashes everybody has personal
preferences you know do what you do that
I should have said one application
that's probably where I messed up but
this is still an amazing mascara it is
hard I will say this it is hard as hell
to get off I mean like you have to you
know get right up to your lashes and sit
there and kind of like get it off
because it will stay on it's it's no
joke it will stay on for a long period
of time so you watch that bad boy up is
not coming off but it's a very black
mascara volumizing lengthening it's not
clumpy unless you do what I do and apply
like two applications of it I still like
it I actually use this every single day
so I love this product and I have
nothing bad to say about it um you know
that's that's all so those are my FIS
for the month of December I hope you
guys enjoy these videos I've been
getting a lot of positive feedback from
doing them so I really appreciate it I
really love doing these videos and I'm
so happy that you guys enjoy them as
well so that is all for this month I
will continue to do more FIS for the
rest of 2013 hopefully and if you have
any FIF say you would like to see please

I'm always looking for new products to
try I actually have a few lined up that
