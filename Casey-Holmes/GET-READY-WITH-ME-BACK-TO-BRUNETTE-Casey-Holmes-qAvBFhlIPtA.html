a get ready with me I'm going to show
you what I've been doing lately for my
hair and makeup like these are my go-to
right now I love it especially this
makeup look it really makes my brown
eyes pop and I just love it cuz it's
really nice and bronzy and glowy but it
just I mean there's no wings liner which
is kind of crazy for me because I love
winged liner
sometimes I go in that lashes sometimes
I keep lashes on like today I have them
on and I love them so I really hope you
guys enjoy this makeup look
she's very bronzy glowy making them
brown eyes go oh yeah I love it don't
mind this self-tan by the way I'd self
tant before I started filming this video
so I currently have it on right now so
it looks blotchy and stuff because once
it develops it'll be good to go so I
really really want to show you guys what
I used to curl my hair this is in sane
so I got this that woke up its the does
anybody else do this to their boxes like
it's I could help myself this is a kiss
instawave automatic curler and this was
like an as seen on tv thing and I was
like wait what and I actually looked
this up on Ulta and they had a demo on
their like a video showing how they did
this and I was kind of scared of like oh
my god my hair is gonna get tangled up I
absolutely love this so I left one
little section right here just to show
you guys because I wanted to show you
just in case and the voiceover you
didn't understand I could show you in
the beginning a little demo so basically
it goes left right so you can do curls
towards your face or away from your face
I did it online away from my face and
this is very hot it has a low and a high
setting
I have mine on hi I'm gonna do is
there's this little piece right here if
you can see there's like a thicker piece
right here in the middle and then you
have four prongs surrounding so what
you're gonna do is take a piece of hair
I like to take pieces at least this big
you can do smaller pieces for a tighter
curl or a little bit more hair in here
for a looser curl and what you're going
to do is you're going to put it back
find this big prom and you're just gonna
do this
forget it we're gonna go literally
that's all you do
then you just sit there and let it heat
up it literally takes probably like 10
seconds not even I hold my odds a little
bit longer but once it's done that's
what it looks like it comes out really
cute like look at that can you believe
that this is like the coolest mention
I've ever seen I really really like this
and the curls do last quite a few days I
would say two days on me
they look really awesome and I just I
love it now make sure your hair is
completely dry if you're gonna use this
I just want to say that since it is
super hot you don't want to damage your
hair or dry it out so if you guys gonna
save my go to hair and makeup for the
spring and summer time then just keep
watching okay so the first color we're
gonna take is a makeup geeks creme
brulee I love this as a transition shade
so that's what I mean you're putting
into my crease today this can go a
little bit on the lid a little bit above
the crease we're just blending it all
over since it is our transition shade it
does it have to be precise or perfect
taking my lorac Pro to go palette I'm
gonna be taking the color cafe and I
really like the brown in this it's just
a nice neutral brown it's not too dark
not too light and I'm gonna put this
mainly in the outer half of the eye but
I'm also going to drag it into the
crease as well just add some definition
to this look then I'm taking this Make
Up For Ever eyeshadow and it's the s55
six and I'm going to be putting this all
over the lid but I am gonna keep the
inner corner blank because we're gonna
put a lighter shade in there but put
this all over the lid leaving a little
bit of space right there in the inner
corner and I love this color it is
absolutely beautiful the perfect bronze
shade for spring and summer oh it's so
pretty I've been wearing it non-stop
then I'm gonna be taking this shade
right here which is just a little bit
lighter it's in I 5 to 8 and we're just
gonna put this in the inner corner to
add a little bit of lightness and
brightness in here and I am gonna be
highlighting quite a bit in this video
so I just wanted to have the eyes go
along with that as well going back in
with cafe I'm just going to touch up the
crease again just blending everything
out
after that we're going to just dab our
brush into the black in the lorac Pro to
go palette and we're going to be putting
this in the outer half of the eye and
just blending it onto the lid and a
little bit into the crease you don't
want a lot of this black you just want a
little tiny bit to put in the outer half
to deepen it up just a little bit go
ahead and take off the tape and you have
a nice sharp line then I'm taking Costa
Reese from Mac at this it's a liner and
I'm going to line the upper lash line I
am obsessed with this liner it is so
gorgeous on brown eyes I just love it it
makes them pop so I'm just gonna put
this like I said on the upper lash line
and then take a pencil brush and blend
this out
that's what it looks like after you've
blended it all out and I'm taking this
black liner from M cosmetics and I just
lined my upper lash line and then some
days I'll just use this mascara which is
the benefit roller lash which I really
like but I wanted to add some falsies so
I'm taking these Coco Misha
lashes and they're really natural wispy
lashes and I love them so much with this
look moving on to face I'm going to be
taking my Too Faced hangover RX and
applying that then right after I'm
taking Italy make up forevers step one
primer and I'm just putting this in the
areas where I get super oily and then
I'm taking my Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation and putting this all over my
face with this a makeup brush with this
makeup brush I'll shadow say make a peak
dang it with this makeup geek brush and
put it all over I love this brush and if
you guys want to see an in-depth
foundation and concealer routine for the
spring and summer time I will leave that
video down below so you could check it
out
after that I'm going to be taking my
Josie Maran Argan illuminator I love
this stuff lately I even love it to put
on my shoulders and my collarbones just
to add a really gorgeous highlight and
glow but I'm gonna put this down right
above my cheekbones where I would
normally put a highlight and then I'm
gonna blend it out with my foundation
brush I just feel like it adds a little
bit more to my powder highlighter and it
makes the powder highlighter last a lot
longer on me so I'll just put this on
the top of my nose my lip and the top of
my cheekbones and then I'll go over this
Marc Jacobs palette that I've been
obsessed with and I'm gonna take the
yellow tone powder and set my concealer
as you can see it doesn't take away from
the highlighter it really just sets it
into place now going to an oldie but a
goodie
Mac's give me Sun I adore this for
bronzing my skin in the spring and
summertime I just think it looks
beautiful gives you a warm golden bronze
look and it's just one of my favorites
and then after that I'm gonna be taking
the Marc Jacobs contour powder and that
same palette and then I'm just gonna be
contouring my face please
after I'm doing contouring i'm gonna
take this mac alpine bronze blush this
is a discontinued product from what i
know is but it is so beautiful if you
can find it in the CCO pick it up
immediately if you can't find this NARS
madly is another great alternative and
then I'm gonna take my Mac duo fiber
brush and I'm just going to blend
everything out and then for highlighter
I'm taking Mac's perfect topping one of
the best Tyler's ever it's not like a
super shimmery highlighter it just gives
you that really gorgeous glow and I
think it's perfect with the Josie Maran
illuminator and I was just showing you
that I turn on the curling iron but now
I'm gonna take the UH Nastasia dip brow
and soft brown again I do have a
tutorial on my brows in my other video
so I will link it down below with the
foundation routine so then I'm taking
coastal reach again and lining my
waterline and also lining the lower lash
line so right underneath those lower
lashes we're gonna go ahead and line it
with this and this is going to be what
we smudge out on the lower lash line I
just my gosh I love this color you guys
so beautiful you need it in your life so
again I'm taking creme Brule and just
blending it all out to making it nice
and smoky
then I'm gonna take my Clinique bottom
lash mascara and just put that on my
bottom lashes after that I'm going to
take strip down from Mac and I'm just
gonna blind my lips and then put NYX
matte lip cream in London on top which
is one of my favorite nude lip combos
right now and then I'm gonna take that
same a lighter shade we used earlier and
highlight my brows and in the inner
corner of my eyes and then that will
finish off the entire look
so for my hair I'm just doing the same
thing I showed you guys in the beginning
of the video that's why I did a little
demo but all you're gonna do is just
twist this thing on up put the curling
iron and you're good to go
this thing gets so hot and then you
don't have to hold your hair on this for
long at all but it's just so convenient
I mean I love it to have one hand free
it's just perfect
so definitely check this out I will
leave a link down below if you want to
check it out and that's pretty much it
so thank you guys so much for watching
this video I really hope you enjoyed it
if you end up getting this curling iron
let me know how you like it it's super
different but I just am obsessed with it
so thanks again for watching and I'll
see y'all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
