makeup tutorial for you and I have to
say this was like the longest makeup
trial I've ever filmed I had absolutely
no idea what I wanted to film I knew I
wanted to get ready I knew I wanted
something smoky because you guys know me
I'm a smoky kind of girl I love my
natural looks but smoky is where it's at
like if I'm gonna go all out I'm gonna
have like black everywhere so this is a
makeup look that I came up with I first
started out as like a oh crap this is
going terribly wrong but eventually you
worked out that's just what happens just
somehow works out but in this get ready
with me I'm gonna show you guys how I
contour and highlight with concealers
that's one of my new favorite things to
do right now I didn't even use a contour
powder this is just a concealer can you
believe it I know it looks so good I
mean I did just some face powder over it
just to set the cream but I didn't put
any contour on my face at all and no
bronzer the only place I use bronzer
with my chest because I don't have a tan
anymore so I hope you guys enjoy seeing
how I used concealers to like highlight
and contour and I also just I don't know
I used that Islander like in the middle
of the lid and then I used a drugstore
highlighter which you guys probably saw
my last video if you saw that you know
probably what I'm gonna use but I had so
much fun filming this video even though
it took me forever I did have fun and I
do like the way that it turned out so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video whether
you watching it like getting ready or
watching it because you're bored
whatever I hope you enjoy it and if you
want to see how I got this makeup look
and all the products used then let's
just go ahead and get started okay so
the first thing I did was I applied my
primer this is the NARS smudge proof
eyeshadow primer it's amazing especially
if you have oily eyelids and we're going
to be taking the morphe 35o palette
today I just wanted to kind of play with
it and I'm taking the vanilla cream
shade and I'm just going to put this all
over my lid to set that primer and then
we're going in with this medium tone
shade and we're just going to apply this
to the crease and blend it up towards
the brow
and then I'm going to take this Shay
which is just a little bit deeper than
the one we put on and I'm going to put
this right in the crease and a little
bit below what we had just done this is
just going to deepen it up a little bit
but you don't want to drag it up over
the first color that we just put on so
this is the quad pin or the duo from
NARS called Pandora this came in such
great handy because the morphe palette
does not have a black and I was like
well with the heck
so I remember they sent this in PR and I
just want to go ahead and take that
black which is a really nice pigmented
black but it's really easy to blend out
as well I'm just gonna take this small
brush and very lightly but a little bit
of pressure put this on the outer V of
my eye you just really want to be
careful with black because it is such a
pigmented intense color and sometimes
it's really hard to blend so building up
instead of just going in with a full
black outer V is going to be easier to
blend and it's just going to look a
little bit better in the end now this is
a part that I hate it because I hate
this little pencil brush that I use but
I couldn't find my Mac ones so this is
from I think it's make it forever I
don't recommend this pencil brush but I
needed something small and precise to
put a little bit more black in the outer
V and this is what I use you just want
to put a little bit in there and then
again blend out with your blending brush
just so it's nice and seamless
now taking this makeup peek eyeliner
I'll leave all the names everything and
the colors listed in the description box
below but I'm going to start with the
edge of my eye and start putting this in
towards the center of my lid and I do
like this eyeliner I just wish I had a
different pencil brush to blend it out
with because it was pretty difficult but
you do just want to focus on one eye at
a time so right when I applied it I went
ahead and started blending it out and
don't worry if it looks choppy because
we are going to put an eye shadow on top
this is just going to make that eye
shadow that we put on look a little bit
more vibrant and intense so I just
decided to build this color up make it
nice and deep and then what we're going
to do is after we blend that out we're
going to go in with a shadow from NYX
and just top it off so this is the NYX
Almonte palette I'm going to take the
purple in here and I'm just going to put
this on top of that eyeliner that we had
and this is a really pretty eye shadow
bit looks even better over top of this
eyeliner it just really brings out a lot
of the different tones of purple that is
in the eyeshadow so I really like it's
kind of a pinky purple it looks really
pretty and then I'm going to go in with
this brown and we're going to just blend
out the edges of the black and the
purple so that they can merge together
and
next step we're going to do a really
light shimmery inner corner so I'm going
to take this one in the morphe palette
and then I'm going to take this flat
shader brush from Mac spray with
six-plus and I'm going to apply that I
shadow all in the inner part of the lid
then we're going to take a blending
brush and blend that out just so there's
no harsh lines and I do go back in and
touch up purple shade right here I'm
doing it just so it's still pretty
vibrant and intense and you can tell
that there's a purple on the lid so I
just took a small precise brush and put
that on top of the purple and then once
again blended it out just so there were
no harsh lines going back into that
black from nars and taking this elf
brush smaller more precise dome shape
and I'm just going to touch up more
black in the outer V just so it's nice
and deep very smoky I'm all about the
smokey life so this elf brush is pretty
nice the out pushes the new elf brush is
actually blend out really well so and
then I'm going to take my original
blending brush can I talk
the original blending brush that I use
and just blend out that black again
so then I'm going to apply a winged
eyeliner and some mascara and then we're
putting lashes on top I'm sorry to show
the winged eyeliner but I feel like you
guys just see me do it so many times so
I figured I would skip that step these
lashes are by the lore and then we're
going in with this cane and Austin
primer which I love it's color
correcting smoothing fills in your pores
keeps your matte it's beautiful highly
recommended so I'm putting that all over
in then going in with my Maybelline
better skin foundation I mentioned this
in my last video so if you wanna check
it out I'll link it down below one of my
new favorites right now I think it's
just a really beautiful foundation then
we're going in with three concealers it
might seem a little excessive but I had
so much fun using all these concealers
and they looked really gorgeous I forgot
how much I loved to this concealer but
I'm taking medium one custard and I'm
going to highlight the face it's just
just going to bring out the features
that you want to highlight and really
just make everything look nice and
bright so I do my forehead nose upper
lip and chin area and it blends out very
well this is such a nice concealer very
full coverage and I'm blending it out
with my Beauty Blender and what's so
great about this line is that they have
so many different shades they actually
added six more I believe to their
collection which is awesome so everybody
can have a shade for their specific
skintone and these can be used over or
under foundation they're a medium to
full coverage and they do have a natural
luminous finish but you can also set it
with a powder to make it matte and its
really soft smooth and it makes you look
hydrated I really like it and once I set
it with a powder it doesn't look cakey
or anything like that which I love and
these are paraben free alcohol free and
synthetic fragrance free which is even
more amazing and I want to quickly add
that the shade I'm using right now is
not that much darker than the shade I
just used this is just a few shades up
and when I first put it on I was like oh
gosh this is too light but once you
blend it out it is the perfect color it
casts the most beautiful shadow right
underneath that cheekbone and I loved it
so much that I use it on my forehead I
don't
ever used contort on my forehead that
much but I love the way that this looks
that I had to put it on my forehead and
underneath my bottom chin I just really
like you guys I think honestly since I
can skip the step of adding powder
contour on top I think this is a great
alternative like a good way to save some
time and then I'm going to take a
concealer closer to my skin tone and I'm
just going to clean up that contour I
don't want to drag the contour down too
much to my jaw because then that kind of
just defeats the purpose of the contour
so first I blend it out with this target
brush and then I go in with my Beauty
Blender and Pat it in and I love it it
looks like a sharp sleek contour I'm
obsessed with that you guys I'm going to
be doing this so much more it's so
awesome and it lasted all day as well
taking my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I'm going to set my face
and for the first time ever I'm going to
bake my contour one of my contour but my
underneath and I actually really ended
up enjoying this it really did make the
contour look even more sharp and it was
just awesome so trying new things in
this video and loving it
we are pretty good
you choose you
Oh
after I've dust away the baking that we
did I'm going to just quickly take my
face powder which is from Maybelline and
I'm going to dust this over my contour
just so that every cream on my face is
set because I do have oily skin so I
want to make sure everything is locked
into place for the whole day now I'm
taking this NARS blush and lovejoy this
is a cult favorite of mine I've had this
forever this blush madly those are my
two like favorite blushes for pretty
much any look and then I'm going to
blend out with my duo fiber brush again
this duo fiber brush puts in work so
shout out to it or sticking with me this
long then I'm taking the essence pure
nude highlighter I'm just going to
highlight my face really beautiful
drugstore highlighter just a few bucks
highly recommend it you can get it on
multicom don't know if you can get in
stores yet but it is gorgeous I
mentioned this in my last video as well
so I'll again have that linked down
below taking the makeup geek eyeliner
I'm just going to put this on my
waterline and also right underneath my
lower lash line and I love the way this
looks on the waterline it's just really
made my brown eyes pop and it added
something a little bit extra to this
look and added a little bit more color
then I'm taking this makeup geek dome
brush and I'm just going to blend this
out I'm not taking it too far into the
inner corner because I'm going to
highlight that area but I'm going to
smoke this out quite a bit
speaking of highlighting the inner
corner I'm going to take the same shade
we used on our lid underneath the brows
and I'm also going to use it in the
inner corner as well
after that I'm going to line my lips
with this poll audio gingerbread lip
liner one of my ultimate favorites and
then I'm going to take a NARS lip
product I forget what it's called but
I'll have it in the description box
below and then that is it for this look
so I hope you guys enjoyed it don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you did
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you all in my next video bye
