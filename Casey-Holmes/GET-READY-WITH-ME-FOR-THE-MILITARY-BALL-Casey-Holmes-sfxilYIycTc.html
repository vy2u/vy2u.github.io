be doing a video where I get ready with
you we get ready together and I'm
actually going to a military ball
tonight with Davis and it's our first
one and I don't think even when I went
to like formal events at West Point I
don't think I did a video on my makeup
so today I decided we're gonna do that
for the military ball I'm gonna show you
guys what I'm gonna do my dress is kind
of like a light blush II nude pink color
very simple actually didn't have time to
get at him so I'm gonna be holding that
dress up quite a bit tonight because
it's pretty long I'm wearing like my
tallest heels that I have and it's still
like three inches too long but it's fine
you know it's just the way the cookie
crumbles yeah so I figured I would share
this with you guys I the look I have in
mind is something that is since it's
such a light dress I wanted something
really feminine kind of sparkly but
light but then I wanted to really smoke
out the winged liner like have a like
smoked out wing you know so yeah I
figured I would film it for you guys and
I'll asked you in a previous video if
you want to see it in a lot of you said
yes so that's what I'm doing today I'm
going to show you kind of what I've done
to my up all day and all the other stuff
you want to get ready with me then
definitely keep watching don't forget to
subscribe before you leave and hit that
thumbs up button if you love get ready
with me videos just love sitting here
having Girl Talk
chillin and don't forget to turn on your
post notifications for my channel so
that you can see all my videos when I
upload them and it notifies you so yeah
let's just go ahead and get started okay
so first thing I want to mention to you
guys is I'm gonna put my hair back real
quick I did put on some body products
before I started to do my makeup because
I want this to have time to dry and like
set into my skin so the first thing that
I used is the video liberado luxury tan
luckily my dress is the maxi dress so I
don't have to put this on my legs so I
just put it on my chest and my arms this
just really evens out your skin and
makes you look nice and flawless so like
with my self-tanner sometimes it looks a
little blotchy this is great to kind of
put on top and even everything out and
give you a nice smooth finish also adds
quite a bit of glow to your skin I love
this stuff I've used this for a while I
kind of use it on and off I mainly use
it for things like this or if my legs
are a little too light my upper body is
dark I'll just apply it to my legs has a
24 hour wear and it just
looks really good on the skin it really
does just blur everything out make it
look really nice and pretty and then I
also add it on this Sol de Janeiro
sunset glow oil I could never say this
so I'm not gonna say it but this is what
I like to use my shoulders you can't
really see it now because I have this on
but I do have this like all over my
shoulders and onto my chest as well just
for a really intense hydrated glow I
love this a lot is a little bit sticky
but it's okay for me I think I will also
put a powder highlight just right on the
top parts of my collarbone for that
all-over intense glow I wanted this and
this is really really great I love it so
much because it doesn't look like makeup
it just looks like you are glowing like
you got a intense moisturizer on I did
put this on top of this as well and I
didn't have any issues with anything
streaking if you're looking for products
like that those two are really great
highly recommend especially the Vita
Liberata one if you just need something
to even you out that's the way to go
we're gonna go ahead and move in new
zoom you guys name we're gonna do some
eyes today I think I'm gonna use the
Aspen over palette from Tarte and I'm
excited because these colors are like
perfect for the dress that I'm wearing I
also did pull my Natasha to know NAT
black is black so I have not used this
palette yeah I just got it this is what
it looks like it is so gorgeous and then
you open it up and it has all these
really really pretty shades in here so
this is what we're gonna kind of work
with just some neutral shades she has a
highlight in a black think I'm gonna use
the different highlights I've tried one
today so I just got done filming another
video and I liked the highlight I used
in that a lot but I might use this we
will see I haven't used tape and so long
then OOP there it is I can't find it so
I am gonna use tape before this look
because I want a really nice sharp line
and when we smoked out this liner I
definitely want something like this to
make it a little bit easier and put this
on the back of my hand if you are
watching this and getting ready for
something like a formal event let me
know down below in the comments like
what are you getting ready for are you
getting ready for a military ball are
you ready for prom because this videos
gonna be up for years so let me know let
me know what you're getting ready for
are you getting ready at all are you
just watching me you know so all I did
with the tape is I just lined it to my
lower lash line and then angled it out
to where like the end of my brow would
be so I'm putting down
my Smashbox photo finish primer in the
shade light I talked about this every
single time I do my makeup and then I'm
gonna go in with the shade married life
right here and I'm just going to set
that entire lid this will help it crease
it will help with the other shades we
put on just to make sure they don't get
choppy or anything like that now what
I'm going to do is take a fluffy crease
brush this one is from morphe it's not
my favorite but I'm gonna use it today
I'm going into the shade
t-time and I'm going to fluff this into
my crease so we're just lightly putting
this into the crease and blending it out
I just want to have a really nice light
hand with it start building it up you
don't want it to be too dark but you
want it to create some definition in
there and these shadows from what I can
tell right now are gonna be nice and
easy to blend so you can really just
work this out once you put it on the lid
so I'm just kind of doing circular
motions here to really buff out those
lines then going kind of back in will
windshield wiper motions see just really
buffs it out when you're wanting to
create like a smoky winged liner or
something having that tape there is just
so much easier and it for me it gives me
more of a visual of what it's looking
like so that's why I love doing the tape
for this now I'm going to take a smaller
blending brush this is the Mac 217 and
I'm gonna go into I think I want to take
high school sweetheart real quick I want
to see what this looks like in the
crease just cuz it adds a little bit of
a mob to the look so I'm gonna do that
we're gonna add this just into the
crease it's a little bit lighter it
looks like than the first shape we put
on but just wanted to see if it added
anything maybe like here in the inner
corner mmm not really just a really
light shade so I'm just gonna do that to
the other eye though so we're even on
both sides what I'm gonna do is take the
shade roadtrip right here
and I'm going to toss this into the
outer V and into the crease so we're
just going to take that here
and work that into the crease this is
gonna add some depth but not make it
super smoky so I'm taking it all the way
into my crease but I'm gonna keep it
below that very first shade that we put
on so right in here and you don't have
to worry about this lid because we're
gonna add a shimmery color on top I'm
gonna take just a tiny bit of tea time
just a DAB and I'm gonna add a tiny bit
right in here because I feel like I kind
of lost that so I'm just very lightly
going right in here to touch that up
just to give us that gradient effect so
I'm going to take Tarte shape tape on
the palm of my hand right here and we're
going to use a flat shader brush Mac 242
I do this trick all the time we're gonna
carve out our lid because I want to put
this heart of gold color down it's just
so pretty so I'll apply this concealer
and then I'll go back in and apply the
shimmer on top
and then I'm gonna take heart of gold
this color right here
I'm gonna put that right on top okay
maybe I use a different brush for that
so it is pretty I feel like I just had
to really dig my brush into there but it
is nice yeah that's gonna be so pretty
with the dress carving this out again
so I'm gonna take my Mac blending brush
and take a little bit of road trip and
blend out the edges very softly just so
it's like nice and faded into these
colors
there is not much of a super deep color
that is pretty much the darkest color
road trip and then wonder less looks
like road trip but with some shimmer in
there and add our own black in there
though I'm gonna take this pretty vulgar
pencil liner will I my eye doing this
one eye at a time because you don't want
this eyeliner just set on you and I'm
not being precise with it I'm just
making sure I line that full top lash
line and extend it out and then I'm
gonna go in with a pencil brush like
immediately after and we're gonna just
blend that out we're gonna smoke it out
and then I'm going in with the Natasha
Genoa blackest black matte eyeliner or
an eyeliner eyeshadow same brush this is
a really intense eye shadow and we're
just going to again kind of smudge this
out so that's what it's looking like I'm
gonna keep working with this black eye
shadow on my brush
okay so this is what the eyes are
looking like so what we're gonna do is
just go ahead and apply lashes and I'm
gonna do that off camera I'm using these
Lillie lashes and mink Miami okay guys
so I have the lashes on looking nice and
smoky so now it's time to work on the
face I'm going to use my favorite
primers I'm using a lot of my favorite
products in this video obviously because
I want to use what I know what works so
I'm gonna use my Smashbox coconut primer
water take the touches so it came as
primer and put this on my skin as well
and we're gonna make be mixing two
different foundations today that I love
and I'm doing it because I want the
color combo but I know it's gonna be a
really good foundation mixture because
they're both for the great foundations
so I'm gonna be mixing in the all ours
foundation from YSL in the shade BB 50
also the LA girl Pro matte HD matte
foundation in the shade light tan so
these are the two that I'm going to be
using today taking my Real Techniques
sponge going to apply this all over
I haven't used a foundation where I have
to match the Vita Liberata so I don't
think I have anything like this warm but
this is about as close as we're gonna
get and it'll be fine it'll all come
together
it'll be cooling oh it looks good so you
know it's all kind of blended out like I
don't have a reflector to reflect light
here I wish I did I should probably
invest it one but it really does match
pretty dang well so tart shape tape in
light neutral as well as the k'kaw
concealer in number six make sure you
get that inner corner cuz you're gonna
want to brighten that up bridge of the
nose now I'm taking the k'kaw and just
putting this on the rest of my face
gonna be really careful around this wing
part sometimes I can get crazy and not
pay attention and I will like put my
concealer over it and it will just
disappear so I'm really making sure I
don't mess up that outer area okay so
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in
and I'm going to blend this out in the
inner corner
really makes a difference to add
concealer in my inner corner because I
am so dark there all right
now we're gonna move into powder I'm
going to use my Marc Jacobs coconut
powder this is the finish line
perfecting coconut setting powder it has
a tint to it which I prefer especially
if you're gonna be taking photos so I
don't have like crazy flash back until I
use mine because mine looks super busted
but I'm just going to take my sponge and
we are going to set this entire face
we're gonna have a nice flawless finish
again being careful to not like get on
top of the outer wing and then I'm also
going to take powder in that inner
corner as well number one final time
with my sponge just to make sure
everything is blended out I do want to
add this underneath my eyes so this is
the essence brighten up in nanna powder
this is just a great way to really
brighten your under eye area really nice
smooth powder doesn't add coverage it
just simply brightens you take it down
my nose chin and forehead now what I'm
gonna do is bronze my skin and I'm
actually gonna use this Smashbox the
callee contour palette because this
makes me look like a frickin bronze
goddess and I feel like would just go
well with this look so I'm gonna take
this shade first and we're going to just
bronze up the skin
just bronzing the forehead making sure
we don't forget about it I'm gonna take
some right here and down my neck and
then I'm going to contour my face with
this ashy contour shape
hey then I'm going to take that blush in
here and put this on my cheeks then
we're gonna use a bomb highlight from
the highlight contour cut from morphe
and it's the aah and it's this beam
color right here you just wait oh my
gosh that is just so pretty oh my gosh
just on your skin and just beautiful
now we're gonna move on to brows and I'm
going to use the pencils out
this catrice eyebrow stylist in date
with ashton and then i'm also going to
use the the balm ferocious brow pencil
in blonde so i'm gonna mix these two and
finish my eyebrows then what i'm gonna
do is i'm going to take that same
highlight shade in that morphe palette
i'm gonna highlight my brow bone
in the inner corner
I understand why this is called being
like I totally get it
and then what I'm gonna do next is I'm
going to line my eyes with the brown
eyeliner I'm doing this because I find
that black eyeliner tends to really
gather in my tear duct area and even
though we said it I just want to make
sure that does not happen tonight so I'm
gonna use a brown eyeliner to be safe
it'll still add some depth but nothing
crazy will go back into the natasha de
Nona single eyeshadow and blackest black
and we're gonna really push this up
against that lower lash line so press it
up against there and on this side I'm
just gonna kind of extend it a little
bit to fix that wing we're going to go
back into that Aspen palette and we're
going to take the tea time show you I
believe it's what it's called yes we're
going to take tea time here and we're
going to blend out the edges of that
black so you can see the difference
there smoked out not smoked out it just
looks ten times better
now I'm gonna take this Lenten wild a
skinny mascara and I'm gonna put this on
my lower lashes this is so good because
it coats the lashes but it doesn't make
them clumpy it's so good I love this
mascara so I'm just gonna line my lips
with this pick up liner
and then I'm gonna use the Mac retro
matte liquid lip in a softly rockin I
didn't think I was gonna like that color
but I don't mind it and then I am gonna
take this Marc Jacobs gloss and sugar
sugar right here that memoir song my
favorites
this is a finished makeup look very
smoky um very highlighted using the dry
bar the rat party it's 343 I'm gonna go
see if Davis is awake because I'm
guaranteeing you he's not awake and he
needs to get ready so
so this is the dress that I'm wearing I
got from Nordstrom so my favorite dress
like if you have a bigger chest it's
kind of uncomfortable because it like
fits perfectly in the waist but is like
suffocating your boobs so that kind of
sucks but it's you know it's okay it's
flattering just has this little ruffle
here a little bit of boobage and then
the back is open as well it's really
pretty but like I said I mean I went in
100% recommend it maybe if you had
smaller chest I mean like try not to
bust out of it you know what I'm saying
so this is the full length literally the
full length of the dress mm-hmm this is
the full length pants
at least yours are head
each other
I don't know how</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
