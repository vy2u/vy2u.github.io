this get ready with me I'm sorry I don't
have a proper intro I forgot to turn my
mic on so it wasn't able to refilm but I
hope you guys enjoyed this and it's
going to be a talk through so if you're
interested in seeing how I got my full
glam look then just keep watching okay
so I'm going to prime my eyes with my
NARS eyeshadow primer this is amazing
I've talked about it so much and then
I'm going to take my scotch tape and
just put this on the edges of my eye
just to get an arse NARS a nice sharp
line I'm going to take this Make Up For
Ever eyeshadow which is just a vanilla
shade I'll leave all the names of
everything down below in the description
box but I'm just going to put this all
over my lid to set that primer and then
we're taking a Max
uninterupted this is a pro eye shadow I
believe it's been so long since I've
used this but I love it it's just a
really really warm terracotta kind of
color it is so beautiful and then I'm
taking this makeup geek eyeshadow in
enchanted forest and I'm going to put
this into the crease it's okay if it
gets a little bit on the lid because we
are going to put a different color on
top but you do want to make sure you
blend this out really nicely in your
crease because this is going to be our
transition shade that's going to go up
to that warmer shade that we just put on
my Mac and if you guys are wondering my
lip is bruised I recently got my lip
redone and I say lip because I didn't
get both of my lips done I'm getting my
lips done for almost like what three
years now but I had to get my bottom lip
done because like let's be real it was
way smaller than my top lip so this is
the most full and my lips have ever been
from this will live because I only got
one done but the most woman it's ever
been it hurts so I'm ready for it to go
down but just don't mind it I'm sorry so
now I just put this green shadow on top
from makeup forever and then I went in
again but I wet my brush with a mac fix+
and I felt like it made the color look a
little bit more vibrant in just a little
more green and I really liked it better
when ever I did the fix+
and then I'm going back in with that
makeup geek eyeshadow and blending out
the edges just so we don't have any
harsh lines
moving on I am taking this L'Oreal
eyeshadow it's one of their newer colors
or not colors but they're newer
collections and it's really great it's
super pigmented I just wanted a little
bit of depth in the outer V of the eye
so I just fluffed this in there and then
I just took the brush I used with the
makeup geek eyeshadow and blended it out
just so it wasn't really harsh now I'm
going back in with the first shade that
we use or the second shade and I'm just
going to again take a blending brush
this one's a little bit smaller and a
little bit more compact than the Sigma
ones this one's for a Mac and it focused
more right there in that crease just so
I didn't get it too high near my brow
then I'm taking this color called
voltage from makeup peak and this is
such a cool color it's like a really
cool highlight shade it's kind of like
nylon but with a green tint to it and I
love it I was trying to find something
to like really make this look pop and
this is exactly what I needed I just
popped this on the inner corner of the
eye and it really added something
different and fun and I just love how
this highlight has a green tint to it
because I've noticed it before but I've
still used it but I think it looks so
much cooler mixed in with the greens
that we have for our eyes shadow today
so love this combo and then I did take
that brush again with no additional
product and just blend it out the edges
now you can go ahead and take off the
tape and I'm just going to do a winged
eyeliner and I'm using my makeup forever
ink liner for this and then I'm going in
with Elena lashes in Serena I love these
they were so gorgeous and fluffy I
highly recommend them and then I'm going
to go in with my regular primers I'll
have all them listed down below but I
love all of these so much and then I'm
going to take my naked skin by Urban
Decay the green tint for redness and I
just wanted to put this all over my
redness I'm still trying to a bunch of
the products that I've been using in my
trying new makeup products videos so
stay tuned for an update I will let you
guys know how I feel about everything
but that's why I'm using this in the
video then I'm moving on to foundation
I'm taking the one heck of a blot by
soap &amp;amp; Glory this was also a foundation
that in fig featured cannot talk today
but this is one that I featured in those
product videos and I love
this I've been using it constantly took
over me on vacation I think it's great
then I'm using my Urban Decay Naked skin
concealer and I'm just going to do the
usual under the eyes the center the face
and blend it all out
I have been loving this NYX HD powder I
love this one and the translucent one I
think they are fabulous they look so
great on the skin and I'm just going to
take the banana one and I'm going to set
all of my concealer that I just put on
and then I'm using this Urban Decay
Beach 2 bronzer I was having a hard time
here but it's in the shade bronze and I
love this you guys this is like one of
my new favorite bronzers it is so
flawless on the skin it's so smooth and
it's so easy to blend out I love it and
I love the color because it is super
bronze and it just looks like you got a
crazy good tan I love it so I also used
a little bit of it to contour right
underneath my cheekbones and under my
lip as well and then I'm using this
blush by Shea Moisture in peach coral I
really really really love this color
this is like a staple for me right now I
think it's beautiful and I think this is
perfect for the spring and summer months
coming up this does blend out really
well as well and I just think it looks
amazing and lasts for a really long time
new highlighter I've been loving is the
urban decay afterglow highlight and this
is in the color syn this is new it is
gorgeous it's a really intense champagne
highlight and when I say intense
I mean it's intense so have a light hand
with it when you first use it and then I
did fill in my brows with the Ardell
brow pomade and I'm highlighting with
that same urban decay highlighter and
then I'm also putting that in the inner
corners of my eyes as well I have been
using these new Marc Jacobs eyeliners
below not brand new but they're new to
me and I've been using the black one and
I use this green one today and I
absolutely love them they're really
creamy really smooth and easy to apply
and they blend out so well and they also
do not run underneath my eyes so that is
a huge bonus and then I'm going to take
the makeup geek eyeshadow that we used
earlier and I'm going to place this
underneath that lower lash line just to
really make that green liner and all the
green in our eyes pop and then I'm
taking the other shade by Mac and just
blending out the edges of that so it is
not harsh and it smokes out this look a
little bit more
then you just want to pop some mascara
on there's lower lashes I always do this
you don't have to put mascara on your
lower lashes but I personally like to do
it then I'm taking this Paula do I
probably said it wrong I'm sorry but
it's in the shade gingerbread I love
this color you can get it all set pretty
affordable it's from the drugstore side
of Ulta and this is a great lip liner
it's really creamy really smooth and I
love this color and then I'm going to
take this Urban Decay Naked 2 lip stick
I have not touched this and so long and
I really love it I think it is beautiful
and then I'm taking the bucks of lip
gloss in a peach daiquiri and that will
be it for the makeup and after I was
doing my makeup I had to snapchat so
this is what I am doing here and if you
want to check out my snapchat I will
leave it down below and also in the
video right now now it's time to move on
to hair I've had so many questions about
my hair but it's really used the same
technique what I'm doing is I'm just
brushing out my hair and I'm using these
foxy locks extensions in mocha toffee I
love them and if you guys want like a
full in-depth video let me know but I
just section off really easily I mean I
don't you know do anything too precise I
just kind of section off wherever I feel
I need it and then add in more
extensions I use about 3 to 4 wefts it
just depends on the look I'm going for
sometimes I'll even use 5 and I love
them these extensions match me perfectly
they're so thick and I've used quite a
bit of product on them and I don't feel
like I have to wash them yet like they
feel really good so these are my
favorite extensions they would have been
using of course if you follow my
Instagram you've seen me tag them and
everything you can see there they just
match perfectly and I was using a Hot
Tools 1 and 1/2 inch curling iron but I
went back to my nume 1 inch and I love
it if you guys want coupon codes for
this I will leave them down below and
then after that I kind of play with it
and then I love this texturising spray
you guys it's from caviar you know I'm
obsessed with that brand but I use this
instead of hairspray because it adds a
lot of texture and my curls last forever
with this stuff I'm obsessed seriously
I've been using it for so long I think
this is like my second or third bottle
and then I do like to brush it out just
to kind of smooth everything out and
loosen up the curls a little bit
and then that is it so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching so sorry about the intro but I
will see you on Tuesday with a talking
video and thank you again for watching
don't forget to like it and I will see
you all in my next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
