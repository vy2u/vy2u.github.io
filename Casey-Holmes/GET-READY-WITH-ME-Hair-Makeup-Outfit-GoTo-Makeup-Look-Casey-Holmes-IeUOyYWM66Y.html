all right nice to meet you hey guys so
we're going to go ahead and jump on into
this video today I'm using the tomato
palette from Anastasia I'm going to take
the color Bingle I'm probably gonna say
all these wrong because I don't really
know the correct pronunciation so
forgive me if I say them wrong but I'm
going to take this color and put this
all over my crease this is going to be
our transition shade and today I'm going
to show you guys and my go-to makeup
look like if I just have no idea what I
want to do with my makeup this is what
I'll do and it pretty much goes with
every single lip color I love it so then
I'm going to take the color fresh and
put this all over my lid and I'm really
gonna Pat this color on just so it's
nice and opaque I can make the bad guys
good for a weekend so it's gonna be
forever
oh it's gonna go down in flames you can
tell me when it's over
moving oh I'm going to take the color
chocolate and we're going to place this
into the crease and a little bit above
the crease you don't want to drag this
down on the lid much because this is
really going to help open up the eye and
it really defines that socket area so
like I said I'm just going to apply this
directly into the crease and a little
bit above just to kind of lift the eye
oh that's what I'm doing here I'm taking
my time and deepening this up I'm not
really just going full force with it and
and just putting a ton of color in there
it's just a building process and
blending it and if you get a little bit
on the lid that's fine because we'll fix
it here in a minute
cherry lips crystal skies I can show you
incredible then I'm going to take the
color pinball again which was the
transition shade and I'm just gonna
blend the upper part of that chocolate
shade just so there's no harsh lines and
it fades really nicely
oh my we thought is it's going back oh
and fresh this is where we're going to
touch up the lid so in case you got a
little bit of that crease color on the
lid this is where we'll touch it up and
really make the lid and nice and white
then when I put this all over the lid
and sorry about that
and just make sure I blend it right
there into the crease I get drunk on
jealousy but you'll come back each time
you leave goes down in on now it's time
to take out the tape and do some liner
I'm using my gel liner from BH Cosmetics
that I love and by the way don't mind my
hands in this video trying out a new
self tanner and you know the struggles
so I just did a winged liner and I'm
going to apply false lashes these are
the house of lashes and tigeress and I
like them but I'm a velour lashes kind
of girl I have to say so moving on I'm
going to prime my face with my Smashbox
pore minimizing primer and then put on
my foundation which is too light I
understand it is too light but like I
said I'm trying out my new self-tanner
so right now I actually don't have
anything that's dark enough so bare with
me and my bronzer then I go ahead and
take my Mac Pro Longwear concealer and
I'm just going to place this in my usual
spots which is underneath the eyes and
the center of the face so above the lip
on
chin and forehead yeah oh he's only in
his bareMinerals well rested powder oh
my hands look so bad don't tell me we
Colman's I know that we're crazy they
don't look that bad in person though so
I don't know but I'm going to set all of
that to concealer with that real rested
powder and then for bronzer I'm taking
these Smashbox bronzer in the Sun Tan
mat and we're going to put this on my
forehead cheeks and also right on my jaw
line
I'm taking my benefit hoola bronzer and
I'm going to contour with this by far
the best contouring powder I've ever
used in my life I just don't know y'all
it just blends so amazingly if you're
gonna spend money on a nice contour
shade hoola by benefit is definitely
your go-to and I decided for this video
to go ahead and contour my forehead and
I ended up really loving it so I haven't
been contouring it much but I figured
hey the smaller the forehead the better
right so now I'm going to go in with
Becca as a songbird and I'm just going
to put that on my cheeks and then taking
this highlighter from Bobbi Brown I'm
going to put this on you toss my
cheekbones I think it wasn't 24-karat I
can't quite remember but I believe it
was so now I'm just going to take fresh
again and place this underneath the
brows I did use my Mac fluidline in a
deep dark brunette for my brows and I'm
taking this mac prolongwear eyeliner and
I'm just going to line my waterline with
this it's very very black and creamy it
does smudge a little bit but you know I
have a very hard time finding one that
doesn't smudge then I'm going to take
chocolate in the black and the palette
things called noir and I'm just going to
put this underneath my lower lash line
I'm just going to press it right there
up against the lower lash line and
really smoke this out I'm going pretty
deep with it then I'm going to take the
first shade that we use and just blend
that out so it's nice and smoked out but
it doesn't look too harsh and have like
a choppy line right underneath the lower
lash line so just keep blending until
it's nice and faded down you driving
that color down here before you want and
then I'm going to apply bottom lash
mascara which this one is by Clinique
and then we're going to go ahead and
move on to lips after that so I'm making
this Calvin Klein lip pencil I'll have
the names that everything was simple
I'm just going to line up my lips love
this lip pencil it's really nice and
creamy and it's a nice shade it's just a
nice natural shade nothing too intense
so after that I thought I wanted to use
a toothpaste melted nude lipstick which
I do love this product but it just made
my lips look like they disappeared and
I've been really into the darker nudes
lately so after I put that on I was like
my lips literally just disappeared I'm
gonna have to fix that so I took the
lock Pro a matte lip pencil and rose
brown and just topped it over that and
it just created a nice kind of rosy nude
and I really really love the way that it
turned out so again this I look you
could pretty much pair with anything I
mean it there's really not a lip color
that you can't use it with I also would
like your hair an outfit you can just
pretty much pair this look with anything
it's my go-to and I love it so for my
hair I just alternative curls just did
some away from my face some towards my
face just so they worked all together
and just kind of broke them up and then
I ran my fingers through them just to
loosen them up a bit and I really have
been enjoying this technique for curls
because it just gives a lot of volume
don't live so moving if your lips are
moving in your lag and then after that
guys you are done so we let you watch
the rest of the video and yeah here we
