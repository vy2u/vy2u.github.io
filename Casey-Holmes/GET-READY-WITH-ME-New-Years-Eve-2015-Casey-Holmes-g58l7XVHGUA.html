with you my get ready with me I'm
currently getting ready to leave for New
Year's Eve and I'm so excited so yeah I
just did this makeup look I really like
it I love the glitter this is one of the
new makeup geek sparklers and I'm
obsessed with it I think it is gorgeous
yeah I hope you guys had a great New
Year's Eve you're probably gonna see
this on New Year's Day I really hope you
guys are excited for the new year I know
I'm excited you guys so much for
watching thank you for all your support
in 2015 and I will see you guys in 2016
I'm probably actually seeing you now but
okay so hope you enjoy it don't get to
give him a thumbs up and if you want to
see what I'm wearing go check out my
Instagram I'll link it right here
actually and you can see it away let's
just get started with the video okay so
the first thing I'm gonna do is take
Cribb relay from make it peak and I'm
going to put this into my crease and I'm
actually using the brush I purchased in
my last drugstore haul and I'm obsessed
with it I really love it so if you're
looking for a new one go check it out
and now I'm using Barcelona Beach all of
these are from makeup geek if you're
interested this is not sponsored by them
I just wanted to play with some more
shadows but I'm gonna put this in the
outer half and bring it onto my lid as
well but I'm not gonna take it all the
way to the inner corner I'm gonna focus
on keeping this more on the outer half
into the center of the lid
then I'm going to take americano which
is a beautiful shade and I'm going to
also put this in the outer V and a
little bit into the center of the lid as
well just to deepen this look up a
little bit
so now i'm taking this nyx of a pop
palette I love these palettes I think
they're amazing and have great
pigmentation and I'm gonna take the
black and just put this in the very
outer V and I'm going to take the same
brush that I had just used I'm going to
use Barcelona Beach to blend this out
and you can see these Nicks shadows are
like so incredibly pigmented and they
blend really really well so if you're
looking for new drugstore eye shadows I
highly recommend them because they're
just so awesome
I'm gonna take this sparkler in the
shade satellite and this is so pretty
but at first I'm gonna take the Too
Faced glitter glue and this brush from
Mac I'm gonna put this on the place
where I want to put the glitter like
exactly where I want the glitter is
where I'm putting this glue so then I'm
going to dip my brush into the sparkler
and I'm going to go ahead and put that
sparkler on my lid this is just a
glitter with a pigment in it as well I
believe it's like really really fine
it's a great great product the only
thing I do not like about these is the
packaging because they are super messy I
get this stuff everywhere every time I
open it up I mean it's just everywhere
so be forewarned they are really messy
but the colors are really beautiful and
very very unique so I love this one this
is probably my favorite and I loved the
way that this turned out but now I'm
gonna go ahead and take off the tape and
then I'm gonna do a winged eyeliner I'm
just using the makeup forever graphic
liner and this ended up going over the
pigment really really well or the
glitter it went over the glitter really
really well and was nice and black so
I'm going to take my bowl or fluff and
whispies these are my favorite lashes at
the moment and then I'm taking my
primers and priming my face and then
using the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation and putting this on I think
my neon robe kind of altered the color
of my neck but this foundation matched
my neck really well I think just the
neon hot pink against my skin and then
my face just it was just not working but
it did look really good I promise and
then I'm taking the Urban Decay Naked
skin I just love this concealer and I I
know it's a good one I know it'll last
all night so I wanted to use this one as
my under-eye concealer for the night and
I'm just using my same foundation brush
to blend all of that out
and you can see I love that yellow shade
and this is another drugstore brush that
I purchased that I really love for
underneath the eyes and I'm gonna take
that powder and set all the places that
I had just put concealer then I'm taking
my Smashbox suntan matte powder this is
a great great bronzer I have no idea
where the lid is but it's a great
bronzer and I'm also using a Norse
kabuki brush I do like this one I feel
like it's a little too dense for my
liking but I end up really loving it
because it blends everything out very
easily then I'm going with my new
favorite thing this is the L'Oreal
infallible Pro contour and medium and
I'm using a Sonia Kashuk brush and I've
been doing this for a while now and I'm
obsessed with this combo the powder is
so good I don't really like the
highlight in it but the contour powder
is beautiful it's a nice ashy tone it
just looks so stunning and then this
brush is perfect to contour with because
it is dense enough but not too dense so
you've lit all of the product out get it
right where you want it and I highly
recommend this duo definitely check it
out it's amazing and it also loved this
powder to contour my nose I mean it's
literally perfection you guys have got
to go check this out then I'm taking my
Becca blush and damselfly I'm going to
put this on my cheeks I haven't used my
bucket blushes in a while so I've been
popping them out a little bit here and
there and I just love them they're so
nice and so just pretty and smooth on
the skin and love them and then I'm
gonna take my benefit Watts up
highlighter and put this on the tops of
my cheek bone my nose and my Cupid's bow
and then taking my new favorite brow
product this is the our Dell brow pomade
and medium brown I've been loving this
as well I've been trying out so many
different products from the drugstore
that are new and I mean this one is just
really great definitely check out the
brow pomade if you love the anasazi a
dip brow I think it's a great do and
then I went ahead and highlight it and
I'm using this pencil from ciate and it
is a great black pencil for your
waterline I absolutely love it and then
I'm taking americano again and I'm going
to put this right there underneath the
lower lash line and I'm just going to
deepen it up and then we're gonna take
creme brulee and blend this out so it's
nice and smoky
and then after that I'm gonna take that
highlight again I'm gonna put this in
the inner corner
this kinda also this highly also has
like a green tint to it as well it's
really cool very unique then I'm gonna
put some mascara on and of course I got
mascara on my nose so I had to let that
dry for a little bit but I was like of
course I'm almost done and I get my
scare on my nose perfection
then I'm gonna take this Smashbox
lipliner and I'm going to go ahead and
line my lips I'm not sure if the color
off the top of my head but I will leave
it down below and then I've been loving
this L'Oreal lip product this is the pro
matte gloss and these are amazing you
guys this is in the color 663 16 I can't
even talk I'm so excited but these are
so perfect I can't even describe to you
how perfect they are I mean the formula
the colors everything you need them in
your life and then I'm taking this lorac
gloss and I'm gonna top it off with that
and then that will complete our makeup
look I'm just gonna go ahead and touch
up my liner on and touch up my wing just
so it's nice and black and crisp and
sharp just how we like our wing liners
to be and then we're gonna go ahead and
move on to hair and get this grease ball
put together because my hair is just a
hot mess
so I'm gonna go ahead and let it down
and I had to use my batiste dry shampoo
like just the regular kind because I'm
all out of my dark tone and it looks
pretty scary at first if you have dark
hair it's kind of like oh my gosh I have
gray hair now but as long as you really
rub it in and brush it out you'll be
fine I don't have any issues with this I
mean sometimes I don't brush it out as
well but usually I'm putting my hair
back up if I do that
so yeah just make sure you rub it in
really well and brush it out and you
will be good to go if you're in a pinch
but I do like the dark tone one for if
you have darker hair and then I'm going
to take bigger sections and I'm using
this Hot Tools one and a half inch
curling iron I have been doing my hair
like this for the past like three months
or so I'm just in love with it I love
the big loose voluminous curls and
they're just so easy to maintain so I do
curls away from my face and towards my
face just to give some added volume and
then I will set it all with hairspray
and that will be it for this whole look
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching
again I really hope you guys had a great
new year and thank you so much for all
of the support in 2015 I love you guys
so much and I will see you all in my
next video
