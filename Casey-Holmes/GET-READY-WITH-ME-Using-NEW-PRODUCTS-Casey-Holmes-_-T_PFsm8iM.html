there is just so much in here and it's
all high-end so anyways if you guys are
interested in seeing me try out a bunch
of new products and just chit chatting
with me then let's just go ahead and get
started first things first is we are
going to be putting our hands into this
gorgeous box I feel like I need to move
you guys back so this is Patrick Starr
and Max collab I think it is so amazing
that a youtuber collabed with Mac I mean
this is insane
this is a really big deal and I think it
is just gorgeous I think Patrick is the
perfect person to collab with Mac he has
so much experience and so knowledgeable
and I'm just super super excited about
this I'm just going to open this up look
at me oh my god it's beautiful
and what I love the most about his
collection is that it's so wearable
we're gonna go ahead and put some primer
on I'm just using my Smashbox lip primer
that I have right here I'm just applying
primer and then I am gonna apply tape I
know some people don't like it when I
apply tape but I mean do what you want
you don't have to apply tape if you
don't want to I just do it because it's
really easy for me I have downturned
eyes and I'm lazy AF and you know what
it's just easy to throw on some tape got
the line done for you you just take it
off and you're good to go so first off I
am going into a Patrick Starr and Max
quad in the shade glam AF and I'm gonna
take this cream shade and I'm actually
gonna put this all over my
I was super so this is really pigmented
all I'm doing right now is I am just
setting that primer so we have a really
even base to work with I'm gonna kind of
go back and forth with both of them
because I don't know what shades I want
to use it's kind of hard to pick going
into the gold gutter and taking this
shade right here and I'm going to throw
this into my crease as a transition
shade let me know if you guys picked
anything up from this collection because
it's one it is a really great collection
because a lot of these items you can use
every day what was y'all's first makeup
product what or what makeup brand did
you just have to have when you first
started your makeup was Mac the one for
you
like when I was younger and I was
getting into makeup Mac was my favorite
and to be honest I didn't even really
know about Sephora I didn't really know
about like all the super high-end ones I
just knew about Mac and I was like I'm
gonna Mac it's what I have to have I
started learning more about these super
high-end ones once I started YouTube and
I was like oh you want $60 for a
foundation no but I feel like this was
always that one brand that everyone was
like oh my god it's a matte lipstick I
love that okay so then I'm going to go
in with this shade right here this isn't
that same goal gutter palette and I'm
taking a smaller brush this is actually
the Mac 217 one of my favorite brushes
and I'm just going to put this out here
and go a little bit more in the crease
so I'm just really fluffing this into
the crease I'm not going above that
first shade we put on which is our
transition shade kind of want to take
this super deep color right here put
that all over my lid and like do a matte
I put these two pallets that gold is so
pretty and then I think I am going to
just take this shade right here and put
this all over the lid just cuz it's so
fall I'm very appropriate for this time
of year
pack this all over the lid nice and
pigmented very pretty shade
okay I'm gonna take a clean blending
brush it's just Sigma e25 I'm gonna go
in there and the edges and just blend
that out and blend very lightly I'm
going to take a little bit of that
deeper shade and just go right into that
crease blend down
so pretty that blended really well I
take another blending brush which is the
first one that we use with our
transition shade and I'm really gonna go
right here on the very edge and blend
that line to make it more faded
see it was like super harsh and when we
add a highlight underneath our brow
that'll help a lot - now I'm gonna go in
with some eyeliner I don't have a new
eyeliner so I'm just gonna use my makeup
forever ink eyeliner and I'm gonna do a
winged eyeliner with this and then I'm
going to go in with these huda beauty
scarlet number eight lashes and then
I'll be right back and we will move on
to our face so I have my liner and
lashes on and now we're going to move on
to face so I'm going to be using this
Catrice all matte + shine control makeup
this is just a foundation I don't know
if this is gonna match me color wise
this one's in the shade amber beige but
we will see so I do have these like
darkening drops from Catrice as well so
if it doesn't match it could always just
mix up a little bit of those think I'm
gonna need just a little bit so I am
going to add a couple of darkening drops
but this is supposed to be a
long-lasting shine control makeup is
like reflecting pigments for a satin
matte and even complexion hydrating
oil-free there's one point one fluid
ounce in here so I open the price in
here somewhere I'm not sure I got that
in PR which I'm really excited about and
then I will also put the price of this
as well and this is the Catrice prime
and find makeup transforming drops and
these are the darkening ones add a
little sliver of that I'll just show you
guys to what it looks like it's the best
part about these is like you can buy
whatever foundation if you're like me
and you hate returning things these are
gonna save your life so I would just buy
those in the lightening and darkening
and just be done I'm going to actually
apply this with a brush today cuz all my
beauty blenders are super dirty so I'm
just gonna take this Tarte brush and
I've already primed with the Smashbox
primer water and the Natasha de Nonna
anti-shine mattifying primer and I'm
gonna do one half of my face this is
like a cold product so I'm just kind of
stamping it in right now it's very
cooling blue and it's looking really
nice so lightweight mm-hmm
no looking bad so that's one side I'm
gonna add a little bit more right in
here just a little bit I'm gonna see if
I can cover I don't think it's
completely full coverage because I can't
really build it up in this area
definitely see some of my rosacea
peeking through because right now kind
of like this side it's super pigmented
due to the weather maybe with a Beauty
Blender though it would be more full
coverage so I'll keep trying this out
letting you know but it's not a terrible
product it's not like accentuating pores
texture or anything like that I feel
like I don't get enough coverage from
foundation I do like to just press it in
and then I'll buff when I feel like I
need to but like look at how nice this
looks on the skin it doesn't look like
it's accentuating really anything but I
definitely want to try with a sponge
because I could still see my rosacea so
that's the foundation it the color looks
like it's oxidizing I will be honest and
I don't think that's the drops I think
that's the actual foundation oxidizing
like it looks like it's going quite a
bit red orange on me it's not looking
too good look at how red this foundation
is like red orange
do they look weird I'm trying a new
foundation this foundation is turning
super red on my skin and we have
somewhere to go so I'm going to be
taking this off and putting on this
foundation this is actually a new
foundation from NARS that is coming out
the end of December and I've been trying
it out and it's so so good I love it
so I'm gonna actually apply that now I'm
going to be using the NARS soft matte
complete coverage concealer I went back
to this one I really really like it
I feel like this foundation is looking
really weird on my skin like what is
going on so I'm just gonna go ahead and
apply this with a cash box blurring
concealer brush this is gonna kind of
lighten this up a little bit I can have
Brighton help with this color this is a
really great concealer especially with
this foundation they just work really
well together I think this is I use the
same brush some of that other foundation
got in this one and made this one hour
I'm thinking that's what happened gonna
go in actually try this brush out for my
concealer right now this is a Smashbox
cream cheek kind of try to blend this
out my face again I normally like to do
under then I'm also gonna take that
concealer and I'm gonna go right in the
inner corner as well just gonna take
like a smaller brush right in here
because since we have such a dark smoky
eye I do want to make sure this is nice
and bright okay so I've got concealer on
we're looking a little bit better now we
get to try the Patrick Starr powder
which I'm really excited about this will
also help kind of lighten up the
foundation as well I'm gonna take just a
dry sponge and kind of go over just
really press everything in just don't
want anything to be
super keiki going to be using Patrick's
powder set powder actually to go wet
this sponge I could have done that with
the foundation but I just now saw it so
this is the sweet and shimmer blending
sponge it feels kind of hard so we'll
see how this works out if not I'll just
take this Ecotools sponge and wet it too
so I'll be right back we'll see how
we'll see how these work ok so this one
is pretty much hard as a rock I'm not
gonna use that so I would not recommend
buying this from Ulta but I am going to
use the Eco tools one because it is nice
and fluffy and just feels really nice
actually let's just run this across the
face real quick now we're going in with
Patrick's powder it does have a little
bit of tint to it but he said it is
colorless so just keep that in mind I'm
going to shake some we're gonna bake
with this so what the powder looks like
and then I like powders like this to I
don't like really completely white
translucent powders most of the time I
like a little bit of tint I'm just going
to bake with this under my eyes
so this powder is been baking for just a
few minutes and I'm gonna go ahead and
wipe it away it looks so smooth it's
highlighted but it's not super duper
highlighted where it's really noticeable
this powder it looks good look at that
wow that's like a filter okay so moving
on I am going to be using this new Tarte
Park Avenue princess palette I love this
palette I tried it on a Facebook live
first and it blends really well you have
a lot of different colors this is like a
great gift for I'm sorry I'm so low this
is like a great gift for a freelance
makeup artist someone who loves
contouring and highlighting and just
makeup in general so I'm going to take a
little bit of angle which is this warm
tone shade with this Tarte brush and I'm
just going to lightly bronze up the skin
just the littlest amount sorry if you
can hear that car actually think that's
an airplane these are really pigmented
but they do blend out very well so don't
be afraid if you accidentally get like a
little plop on your face they will blend
out and look really nice another really
good thing that chart came out with are
these little set of face brushes right
here they're so cute first of all but I
love these two like contour highlight
could even use this for a foundation or
even this for foundation you can use
brushes for literally whatever you want
I have been using this for bronzer I
just didn't use it now because I had
this one right next to me I'm using this
one to contour as well as just taking
this end and using that you could use
this to highlight if you wanted to I've
also used this to contour I mean you can
use these for so many different things I
love these brushes how they recommend
they're super soft they blend everything
out really well to take this one I'm
gonna take is more cool toned color
called princess cut and I'm going to
contour underneath my cheeks just let
these out a little bit
I'm just gonna do like that and then
when he's a little bit of a brush with
nothing on it and kind of go over it
just to kind of diffuse it so we have a
Christmas party tonight and I am going
to be looking like I'm going to the club
so now I'm going to take the shade
enhance this yellow tone powder using
this Smashbox brush again this one's the
blurring foundation but I'm going to
carve out my contour one more time with
this this is the mineralized blush
imperfect bronze of course I was all
about it because it said perfect bronze
so this is what it looks like sorry the
ring light is kind of just like
reflecting off of it
it's a really pretty package something
different kind of has like this dome is
a dome like a dome shape to it and then
you just have one side that's more of a
pinky color and then you have the bronze
color so I'm going to use my sigma blush
brush I'm gonna kind of swirl it and
then woah apply to the cheek was a lot
of blush so a little bit goes a long way
and then when it also dosed away this
baking that we did like Too Faced also
came out with another highlighter this
is the diamond light multi use diamond
fire highlighter so it comes in
packaging like this take it out it's
kind of like a ring and then you just
press this open it up and then you have
this really pretty highlighter so just
again has it like iridescent look to it
I'm gonna see what this looks like I
just want to I want to do a little
swatch and see yeah that's just not I
get that it's like a really big trend to
do this but I don't know I'm gonna apply
it and show you guys very pigmented and
what I can tell if it didn't have that
purple tint this would be stunning
stunning I would wear it all the time
just applying it to this cheek I love
the formula of this I think the formula
this is probably the best that
two-face's ever come out I think it's
gorgeous don't get
if I wasn't going anywhere I totally
wear this for a video study like a soft
buttery formula that doesn't emphasize
texture but I just can't do the purple
Sheen so I am gonna do it on the other
side just to make it even but I'm gonna
go over it a little bit with my honest
Asya highlight so okay so since I need
something a little bit more wearable I
am gonna go in with the UM Stasi aglow
kit the sugar one use the shade
starburst to go over top of that to face
highlighter okay so now I'm gonna
quickly fill in my brows with this
makeup a revolution brow pomade in the
shade come on I'm going back into the
Patrick Starr glam AF palette I'm going
to take this matte cream that I used in
the very beginning and I'm just gonna
highlight under my brow with this so
freakin pretty I love I love these
eyeshadows okay if I had Mac's
coaster reach I would totally use that
on my lower waterline I'm just gonna use
a brown this is the pur cosmetics on
point eyeliner and down to earth then
I'm going to go in with a flat definer
brush which just looks like this I'm
gonna take that gold shade I'm gonna
press this up against that lower lash
line
I press that up against my lower
lashline and I'm taking a little bit
more that gold and just really buffing
it pretty far down on my lower lash line
just so that way you can really see the
color I'm going on with the benefit
roller lash mascara and I'm going to put
this on my lower lashes we're going with
one of Patrick's lip colors so I'm going
to take what color do I think I want
this one which I believe is mom and
start right yeah actually I'll just use
this light pink one this one's in the
shade edge to edge you're not really
going to see this one underneath the lip
and then I'm gonna go in with the Mamas
star lipstick
so pretty
normally I don't wear lipsticks like
this but I really wanted to try it
because I love this color then I'm gonna
take a little bit of the lip glass in
Mama star as well and just put this on
top this is like my kind of color for
real now I'm going to show you guys my
hair real quick just a quick little
tutorial nothing crazy I'm gonna use the
dry bar what's this called again wrap
party one I like to set mine to 4:30 it
only takes like a few minutes to heat up
time I take my hair down brush it out
it'll be ready to be curled so I'm just
gonna take it down I put some dry
shampoo in earlier so now I'm just going
in so I just divide it into two sections
like so curling iron is ready to go and
all I do is I take pretty big sections
like this just like an inch and a half
and I take the wand and I just point it
down and I wrap it around the barrel
tightly like a good two to three inches
I leave a lot out just cuz I like a wave
and the way this barrel shaped it's like
smaller a little bit right here and a
little bit bigger on the ends and it
really just gives you that beachy look I
love this curling wand when I mentioned
it in my favorites video people thought
it was sponsored but it wasn't I just
purchased a new wand
I just never talked about new curling
wands coz I was using that new me one
for forever it let it down I don't like
a super tight curl never have and I do
like to alternate my curls just because
I find if I don't my hair just kind of
sticks together and it doesn't give me
as much of all you maz I want and I just
do this to my entire head for the next
section I grab from underneath and I go
towards my face like so
okay so I'm gonna put this in
fast-forward now you guys can just watch
so I can listen to music
okay so that is pretty much hugging my
curls I just like I'm really loose nice
and messy sometimes I'll leave the hair
on the wand a little bit longer so I can
get a tighter curl but for the most part
I like just like a wave some texture I
love this or baked dry texturizing spray
I know a lot of you were asking how I
use that one and that is how I use it
just to get these curls I just brush
them out so that is pretty much it for
this video I hope you guys enjoyed it
don't forget to enter my giveaway down
below and yeah I will see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
