a tutorial on this look I mainly wanted
to focus it on a makeup look for my
girls with oily skin that want to look
like they have the dewy skin now you
already have naturally dewy skin but I
know most of us like to control the oils
that we have and then fake the do you
know what I'm saying I love this look I
think it's really nice I do this look
whenever I'm going out and I'm going to
look glowy and pretty and I love it
because I really put a lot of shimmer on
the eyes I do a matte crease and then
the rest of it is pretty much shimmer
just to really bring some light to the
eyes and really make them glow and then
for the face I think the main thing is
to use a really nice foundation that is
oil-free it's not going to make you
overly oily like if you would to have
gone out and gotten a foundation that's
supposed to make you Olli you know
foundations that have a luminous look to
them are made for people with more
normal to dry skin not so much oily
because your oils and the foundation are
just not going to mix together but I
really like this one because it is oil
free but it looks like beautiful natural
skin it doesn't look heavy it doesn't
look cakey so I'm going to show you how
to use it this foundation and then
incorporate some highlighting into it as
you go up throughout the day your skin
will probably look even more doing just
because you are oily and I know for me
my oles will come through really quickly
especially right here so I like to leave
a lot of the highlighting away from this
area and just focus it mainly out here
on the outer half and like the top of
the cheekbones and things like that
everybody hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'll be showing you some tips and
tricks and talking about these products
so yeah if you want to see how I got
this makeup look then just keep watching
okay so the first thing I'm going to
take is this makeup geek eyeshadow in
desert sand and I'm just going to put
this into the crease with this morphe
brush I've talked about these in my last
favorites video so if you haven't
checked it out I'll link it down below
but I really love this combo I like to
use this color mainly above the crease
just a little bit because I don't have
that much lid space so I like to fake it
by putting the crease color just a
little bit above where my natural crease
is just so it really expands and makes
my lid look a lot bigger than it
actually is
I'm just going to go ahead and do that
and blend all of that out and then next
up we're going to take this makeup
forever palette I love it I'll leave all
the names of the shadows down below but
this is a really really gorgeous palette
one of my favorites and I'm going to
take this shade right here which is more
of a darker shimmery shade and I'm just
going to put this more in the outer half
of the eye but I'm going to take it to
the center of the eye and I really like
it this color combo you're probably like
it doesn't look good but I promise you
it'll look good when we're done so I'm
just going to again put that in the
outer half and then all we're going to
do is we're going to flip with that
brush over and then we're going to take
this lighter shade right here and put
this in the inner corner and blend it
into that color this just really adds
dimension and makes your eyes look nice
and bright and I love it this is such an
easy eyeshadow look to do and the colors
look beautiful together like look at how
beautifully they blend it's just
gorgeous I love it
we're just going to take the same brush
we used earlier and just go in the
crease and blend this out I didn't add
any more eyeshadow I just took whatever
was left
they don't take in my NARS eyeliner in
via veneto and I love this eyeliner
because it stays all day but it's really
really great at smudging it's not hard
to blend or anything so I'm just going
to line this on the outer part of my eye
and I'm going to use some of the tape to
help with this now I'm just going to use
a pencil brush and blend it out and I
like to do this because it adds more
dimension again to the look but you're
not overpowering the shimmery shades we
just put on your lid you know it looks
really nice but the eyes still look nice
and bright as well so I'm just going to
take that tape off and blend out some
more and then I'm going to do the same
exact thing on the other eye
after that I'm going to line the top
waterline and this is not a cute face so
I always just skip it and then I'm going
to put on lashes so I'm going to curl my
lashes apply mascara and then apply
these Koko lashes and goddess which I'm
just so in love with I just love them
then I'm taking my Smashbox primer water
and I'm going to spray my face with this
this is just a great hydrating primer
that will go along with the do enos and
then I'm taking my makeup forever
mattifying primer and you're probably
thinking why are you mattifying your
face when you're trying to get a glow
but that's because like I said earlier I
want to tame my oils and just fake the
glow I don't want my real oils just
coming through and going crazy okay so
next up I'm going to take this
foundation it is the Too Faced
undetectable medium to full coverage
foundation and you can see I do have
problematic skin I have redness and
scarring and this foundation covers up
everything it is oil free so it's
perfect for a look like this but it
still looks like natural skin it doesn't
look too mattifying or anything it does
give you a nice glow if you don't set it
I just set underneath my eyes and where
I put concealer but otherwise it is
absolutely beautiful and I'm just in
love with it now this foundation is
really weightless I mean you can't feel
it on your skin it's not heavy at all
and it also has a coconut water as an
ingredient which i think is amazing and
what coconut water is going to do is it
helps replenish your skin's moisture
levels without over hydrating so it's
going to give you that radiant naturally
looking dewy skin it's just so beautiful
and again this is just a great
foundation for if you do have oily skin
but want your skin to not look
completely matte this is just beautiful
so now I'm going to go in with my
concealer and I'm going to put this
underneath my eyes in the center of the
face this is what I always do every
single time I put on makeup I just think
it really makes a huge difference and
brings a lot of light to your face so I
love it and then I'm going to take my
regular NARS concealer and just
highlight my nose because I always
headlight and
contour my nose
and I'm going to take this Josie Maran
Argan and illuminizer and I have been
using this to death lately and all you
need is a really small amount and I put
it right on the tops of my cheekbones
and then I just blend it out with my
Beauty Blender and again it gives you
another natural nice looking glow I love
this stuff I put this stuff everywhere I
put all my collarbones my shoulders oh I
love it is beautiful you need it in your
life so I'm going to also put it on the
top of my lip and then also in the
center of my lip as well
and then I'm going to take this Marc
Jacobs palette and take the yellow shade
and I'm going to set my under eye
concealer now this is going over some of
that highlighter we put on but I promise
you you'll still see it the stuff is
bomb so now I'm going to go on with
these Smashbox bronzer and just bronze
my face with this I love it love it it's
so beautiful it's a matte bronzer and it
just gives you great color then taking
my favorite blush of the moment this is
my Lau Milani is luminoso and I've used
this for years but I just have gotten
back into it and it is so gorgeous it
does have a little bit of shimmer in it
but it's not going to make you look like
a crazy person with a ton of shimmer on
your face it's just so beautiful and
then I'm going to blend it out with this
brush from morphe I forget the name but
I'll leave it down below and then I'm
taking this Becca highlighter in opal
and I'm going to highlight my cheekbones
with this as well so it's just going to
add a more highlighting in a glowy
effect to your face and again I'm going
to put on the top of my cheekbones down
my nose a little bit and on my lips
taking my Anasazi dip brow I'm going to
fill in my brows really quick and simple
I think I showed how to do my brows in a
video a couple of times back and then
I'm going to take this Rimmel eyeliner
in nude and just put this on the
waterline this will make your eyes look
bigger brighter perfect for summer and
I'm going to go back in with that makeup
geek shadow and just blend this on the
lower lash line I didn't want to smoke
it out a lot but I did want some color
down there and I felt like this was the
perfect color for it it didn't take away
from anything it just looked gorgeous
and then we're going to take that shade
we use on the lid in the inner corner
and we're going to touch up the inner
corner highlight and then also use this
underneath our browser we applied our
bottom lash mascara it's time to go
ahead and move on to lips I'm going to
be taking this Mac lip liner and whirl
and I just love this it's a staple for
me I'm just going to go ahead and align
my lips per usual then I'm going to be
going in with this lock Pro matte lip
pencil and pink taupe it's a staple for
me I've been using it constantly lately
I just think it's gorgeous with any look
that I do and then to add to the glow
enos of everything I'm a Ken they're
gonna take this highlighter and put it
in the center of my lips and then you
are done so I got I hope you guys
