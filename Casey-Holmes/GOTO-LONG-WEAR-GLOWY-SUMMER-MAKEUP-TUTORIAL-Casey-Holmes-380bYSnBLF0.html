today I'm going to be doing a makeup
tutorial on this book right here a lot
of you requested that I step away from a
super smoky eye for a little bit and go
to something a little bit brighter
glowy just great for summertime and this
is a look that I came up with or one of
the looks that I came up with a lot of
you are also asking for Bridal tutorials
and I think I'm going to do two Bridal
videos so I will have that for you guys
very soon
but I figured I would go ahead and get
this video up because a lot of you just
really want something kind of fresh
awake
glowy something that you could wear on a
summer day some are nine whatever you
want to do if you like this list don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe before you leave just so you
don't miss out on any of my videos and
let's go ahead and get started with this
makeup look first thing I'm going to do
is pry my eyes I finally got another
Smashbox lid primer in light I ordered
this off of Sephora it's a really great
way to just even out the lid smooth it
all out and then there's a really good
primer as long as you set it and then
what I'm going to do next is I'm going
to use the modern renaissance pouch a
I'm going to use a few shades out of
here you can use whatever palette that
you have or whatever colors that you
have that kind of resemble the look that
we're doing today but I haven't used
this in well so I figured I would dig
back into it so I'm going to take this
shade right here I'm going to use a
fluffy blending brush and want to just
just this all over the lids so we can
set that primer
the next step release tape I use tape so
much you guys that I bought a tape
dispenser so it could actually like not
be an itch so it looks super cute on my
desk because I use it so much I even
have shadow shields but you know
everybody got tape
I just find it super quick for me to do
my makeup but it's totally optional you
don't have to do it if you don't want to
are you going back into that palette I'm
going to take the shade of burnt orange
I'm going to throw this into my crease
with a not this one with that segment
blending brush we use the first so you
just want to do circular motions all
over also if you guys are wondering
where my super coral top is from it's
from Target I think it was like $12.99
and it's so comfortable
we're going with this J which is the
darker shade that we will go with today
I'm just going to throw that into my
crease right below that transition shade
we put on so system that in there
okay and then after that I have a few
different things that we could use so
there's obviously a really pretty
shimmer shade in here which is right
there
but I also really loved these Make Up
For Ever starlit powders this one's in
the shade number 13 it's like my
favorite then I have a steely glitter if
we're going a little crazier though the
first thing I'm going to do if I may I'm
going to put this primavera shade all
over my lid so pretty
whenever I do shimmer shades on the lid
I like to imp it up a little bit so
that's what we're going to do but as
always if you wanted to stop here
put on some liner just to define the eye
and tell mascara you can do that you
know this is all up to you you can - out
things that you don't want to do if
you're a long time you can always get
certain steps in this tutorial I'm
taking it right in there right above the
crease and just kind of carving out a
line right there this is the mac 242
highly recommend this for all over the
lid shade and I'm going to take the Too
Faced glittered lip now you can see
holds tutorial without some glitter glue
so this is just if you want to use like
a loose glitter or if you want to use
the Stila glitters I highly recommend
these again this is definitely gonna be
a little bit more intense but it makes a
really big difference with opening up
the eye and they can you look super
awake so I'm just going to throw this
all over the beginning of the lid going
in with that makeup forever
starlet powder I'm just going to pack
this onto the lid
and then just like to Pat for the most
part because I feel like it distributes
it really nicely just like that see just
brightens up that lid so the next step
that I'm going to do is just line my
lash line my upper lash line I'm going
to use this Lottie wing woman
eyeliner really great felt tip liner I
like to line my upper lash line just to
add some definition so that's what I'm
going to do here
and I am that alignment upper waterline
not my lower one with this Lahti a.m. to
p.m. liner because what it's going to do
is you can see that skin right up there
this is really just going to make it
really nice and black and make your
lashes look a little bit fuller then
we're actually going to try any mascara
today because I've been dying to try
this and I figured this would be the
perfect look to try it out with and it's
the l'oreal lash paradise voluminous
black is black after everybody else
we're talking about this and I've been
dying to try it on like on it I love
this packaging I think it's so pretty
and everything is a dupe for the Too
Faced better than sex which says like
one of my favorite mascara the one does
look super similar if you were going to
do just mascara I wouldn't recommend
doing liner unless you really wanted to
because then it kind of takes away from
your lashes the best care looks nice the
slash is always better like this eyes
they're the best eye when it comes
lashes I think by itself it's going to
be really really pretty like without
liner and all of that but it did grab
each lash which I appreciate so so far
so good
we throw in false lashes on a little bit
later because then I'm going to film
more videos and if you want to have
false lashes on but we're just going to
go ahead and move on to face and I'm
going to do my regular primers because
these lasts throughout the day
beautifully I love them so it's the
Smashbox primer water and then you can
and also at prime and protect in your
t-zone someone tweeted me and told me
that came in Austin is actually on Ulta
nel so you can use your open points if
you have any to get some money off of
this product so I highly recommend doing
that just to modify and submit without
the skin okay and now we're going to go
in with foundation I'm going to be using
an e maybelline superstay better skin I
love this because it looks like a second
layer skin but it makes you look perfect
I just really love this foundation you
can tell I've used quite a bit of it so
I have two shades I have the shade of
beige and stand beige something I'm
going to be more skin
age this might be a little dark but
we're putting on concealer and
everything so these fine oh no we're
good this just looks so beautiful on the
skin so they medium the full-coverage
foundation affordable can't beat it
and on me it lasts all day long and it
dries down to really nice like natural
matte finish you see there's not a lot
of shine on my skin I feel like I get
caught up with so many other products
that I forget about like hi true love
and this is one of my true love's I'm
pretty sure I mentioned this in my
drugstore favorites video paying the
next up I'm going to use an oldie but a
goodie I wanted to see if I still love
this concealer because it's been so long
and I was on Ulta and Mac is now sold on
Ulta so I wanted to test it out and it
is the impact for a long wear concealer
in NC 20 we're gonna test this out don't
see if I still like it I'm pretty sure
will you never know oh I'm also going to
go wet this real quick it's be Sephora
cake and baked sponge this is what I
also left the South Carolina but I have
another one I'm so excited
so minimal wet this and then apply this
bad boy oh my gosh I have missed the way
mac makeup smalls
that probably sounds really weird but I
gotta bring back so many memories
and this is a pro longwear so it's going
to last all day long I just forgot how
much I love to this concealer like it
really does look beautiful on the skin
and a lot of people ask why I use so
much concealer and it's just to
highlight and conceal it's just what I
like to do you can obviously use less if
that's what you prefer but especially in
pictures if I don't bring the concealer
down quite a bit to highlight the face
it just looks off it just looks like
concealers right here piled up and it
looks a little weird so it's just my
preference you know you can do it ever
you feel like doing but that's just how
I love to do my makeup no matter what
kind of look I'm going for
alright I think I'm going to start using
a concealer more to be honest with you
love it
love it so now we're going to set the
face I'm going to use the cokie
translucent setting powder this is just
in the shade translucent all i'm going
to do is just take a regular powder
brush not baking today and i'm just
going to press it into that under-eye
area instead the entire face now if you
want your makeup to last a little bit
longer for me personally with oily skin
i find that baking really does help but
if you don't like to bake you don't ever
have to think you could just set your
face and be good to go okay so next up
we're just going to go ahead and do
brows my favorite brow product is the
makeup revolution brow pomade and shade
blonde I just I cannot to get away from
this I think it's great I think the
colors perfect and I've used so much of
this product so I'm going to go ahead
and fill in my brows and I'm also going
to apply lashes again you don't have to
if you don't want to but I'm going to go
ahead and do it and then I'll be back
and we'll finish up the face okay so
this is what it looks like with lashes
and brows on and just feel like you'll
explode and whip it together look at
more glam but now I'm going to go ahead
and finish up the face and I'm going to
use a one of my favorite bronzers right
now which is it Marc Jacobs the
fantastic Omega bronzer I've been loving
this filya Kashuk brush that I need to
wash I'm just going to bronze up the
skin so on the forehead goddess
foundation concealer combo just look so
nice
those smooth I'm really feeling it right
now go up here get my cheeks gonna make
ourselves look nice and bronzed and go
loi this is such a nice like super
smooth bronzer like it doesn't look like
you really broadens your skin it just
looks like a really natural tan which I
appreciate and then I am also going to
contour with this I'm just going to take
a smaller more dense brush and though
this underneath my cheekbones so I love
that it's versatile as well you chains
all over the face so you could just
contour with it okay and now I'm going
to put on blush I'm going to be using
this cokie blush up trio and this is in
the shade blushing i'm going to be using
the very end shade which is a nice kind
of coral peachy color actually mix it
with the first one first ones more the
light peach this is darker
like peaches Tucker probably put a lot
on my brush
wish me luck guys oh so pretty I'm
aboard kind of girl I love blush I just
think it really adds to a look
I love applying it like I'm that girl
that applies too much blush and then
I'll go back in and blend it out because
I just don't know I love it and then
we're going to go in with my favorite
favorite thing and that is my smashbox
spotlight palette and pearl this one in
the gold is perfect perfect for
summertime especially the gold I'm going
to use the pearl so it kind of goes
along with the lid color you can also
use the lightest shade in this palette
as your lid color if you wanted to see
that one else on HSN and it looks
stunning I mean it looks kind of like
this by Anthony this is just to kind of
go along with that eye we're going to
use all three shades you have texture if
you have pores you're worried about this
is such a great palette actually use
this on the davis's mom and our friends
that we're getting married their mom
which is one of our good friends and it
looked so gorgeous on their skin I could
not get enough of it I mean if you
follow me on snapchat you saw it it
looks so built everyone's skin no matter
what age you are if you have wrinkles
you have large pores anything like that
it just looks good on everyone and
highlight the face
so again that is the spotlight palette
and pearl this is not supposed to be
like a super intense metallic highlight
because those kind of highlights really
emphasized texture and import and I
wanted something that everyone to use
whether you have great skin whether you
have problematic skin this is something
that is going to lay on top and just
look beautiful and give you that nice
glow that you're looking for I love it
by far I mean obviously it's like my
favorite highlight because I helped
create it so and I'm going to really
quickly go into this a lighter shade
with a brush and pop this underneath my
brow I really love it my brow highlight
matches my highlight on my face so I'm
just going to do that real quick putting
a little bit extra right here under that
arch just don't really pop okay so that
is our highlight done we're all glowy
you can do the next step is going to be
finishing up our eyes so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to use something
that's really going to brighten up this
eye and that is going to be like a
skintone color pencil so this is a next
wonder pencil I love this I'm going to
miss this all right on that lower
waterline what I love the most about
this is that it's not like a really
intense white color it's more like a
skintone color has like a pink tone to
it so see just a little change so it
really opens up that eye and then I'm
going to go in with a brush like this
and we're going to go back inside on the
stealthiest palette and I'm actually
just going to take that orange shade
again this one and press this up against
that lower lash line
I'm going to use a pencil brush I'm
going to go in with this shade which is
golden ochre very very light shade we're
just going to blend out the edges of
that and this will also kind of tone
down the orange just a tiny bit so if
you're little nervous about wearing
orange on your lower lash line this will
help you out and then what I'm going to
do is use the same brush we use to
highlight our brow bone I'm going to use
that make up forever starlit powder I'm
just going to take it put that brush on
the very tip and I put this in the inner
corner you don't have to do this
definitely a little bit more glam but I
think it really just adds a little
something extra to this look this again
really opens up that I makes you look
super awake so you can take it right
here go against that orange bring it up
around the tear duct area so we're going
to add some mascara to our lower lashes
since we put that light color on our
wire line that really helps open up the
eyes it makes it look kind of dull life
which i think is cute so to line our
list I'm going to be using the pool
audio lip liner in the shade Gingerbread
and then I'm going to top it off with a
new gloss that I have not tried before
it's the smashbox the legendary liquid
pigment and a shade of bad B I thought
this would be perfect for this look so
that's what it looks like and thank it
so this isn't bad B and again I have not
tried before I love the color on top
which everyone would do this
so when you store them you know what
color it is this is what the applicator
looks like again I have not tried this
boo this magic might not perfectly I
just feel like a glossy lip with this
look really completes it then again I am
going to take a little bit more of that
make up forever starlit powder and just
put it right in the center ok guys so
that is it for this video thank you so
much for watching I really hope you
enjoyed it and enjoyed this makeup look
