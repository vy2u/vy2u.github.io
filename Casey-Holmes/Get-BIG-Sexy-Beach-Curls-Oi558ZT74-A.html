be on these big big beachy hair thing I
got going on if you don't know I have
pretty naturally straight hair it has a
little bit of wave to it but since I
straightened my hair so much throughout
the years it's just like out the door
I'm going to show you guys if you have
pretty straight hair I got this and I'm
gonna show you guys how you can get it
too I use pretty great products in this
video I use things that are going to
help enhance the curl so basically I'm
using I'll show you what I use these two
products from Marc Anthony they're
definitely gonna want a texturizing
spray something that's gonna help you
know mould your hair because your hairs
that may look a little crazy when you
start drying and taking the curls out
but this will definitely help kind of
tame everything and seal it together and
then I use these Marc Anthony products
you have the curl booster and the curl
defining lotion
where's you're gonna help enhance the
natural crow you have so it's gonna make
it all really look good and really help
hold the curl all day long so you
definitely want to check these out I'll
put them down below I'll put all these
products down below I also use a
diffuser now my hairdryer come with the
diffuser so I went bought this at
Sally's for $12.99 and I'm obsessed with
it it's great for travel you can just
pop it right in hope you guys enjoy this
if you want to see how I did it then
just keep watching bye guys
so like I mentioned in the beginning of
the video I'll be using these two pots
from Marc Anthony you can get these
products at CVS and Rite Aid I'm going
to be using the curl booster and the
curl defining lotion and then like I
said it also got this diffuser at
Sally's for $12.99 so you're gonna let
your let your hair air-dry for a little
bit after you have the shower do
whatever you want to do personally i
self-tan and you're gonna go go ahead
and wide toothed comb your hair now I do
recommend a wide toothed comb because
using just a brush will break in here a
lot easier than a wide tooth comb will
do so I definitely recommend one of
those in your hair routine
so now I'm going to take the curl of
finding lotion I'm taking about a
quarter size amount and I'm just going
to run this throughout all of my hair
now I'm going to take my diffuser and
I'm just going to pop this onto my
hairdryer my hair dryers from nume and
if you're interested in where I got it
from and any coupon codes I will put the
links and information down below so if
you've never diffused your hair before
it's the most simplest thing you'll ever
do all you do is just gather your hair
in the diffuser and take it up to your
hair or your head I'm sorry this is
great if you have really really curly
hair it's a lot better than just
regularly blow-drying it because it
keeps a little bit more tamed but if you
have just a slightest bit of curl to
your hair like I do this is also great
really enhancing it which is what you
want for this tutorial and we're going
to just blow dry until it's just a
little bit damp you don't want it too
wet or too dry because we're going to be
twisting it here in a minute
I'm just gonna take these bobby pins
from Conair I got these at CVS also and
I'm just gonna start twisting my hair so
I'm taking just sections like little
ones like this and I'm just going to
twist them away from my face because I
like my toes to be away from my face and
I'm just going to twist it really
tightly as much as you can and since
you're twisting it it's just naturally
going to gather up when you put it to
the top of your head just like that and
then you're just going to want to pin
this on the top of your head
I also forgot to mention that you want
to place your bobby pins and an X so
just kind of crisscross them over that's
just gonna ensure that your hair does
stay up and doesn't fall so I'm just
showing you guys again I'm you just
twisting my hair away from my face all
the way down and I'm just putting it up
into the bobby pin so just gonna run do
this all over you don't have to be
precise or anything like that just pick
and choose your sections bigger or
smaller
mine are sort of medium they're not
really tiny or anything like that but
I'm just going to go ahead and do this
all over my head and I will be
so after all your hair spin up this is
what it should look like you look like a
crazy person but that's okay because
you're the only one seeing yourself like
this or unless you're like me everybody
is but I'm gonna take this Marc Anthony
curl booster spray and I'm just gonna
spray this all over these just to make
sure those curls are nice and lock down
and then you can go do whatever you want
to do you can actually sleep on this if
you wanted to but I just went into my
makeup obviously so now I'm just gonna
take all of these down and it doesn't
matter in which order you take them down
or anything like that just make sure you
get all the bobby pins out of your hair
so this is what your hair should look
like mine kinda reminded me of Angelina
Jolie in that one movie when she had
dreads I don't know but I'm going to
take the curl booster spray and I'm just
going to spray my hair one last time and
I'm gonna take my hair dryer and just
sort of loosen up these curls and dry
them just a little bit I waited about an
hour to take these down of course like I
said you could sleep on them if you
wanted to if you really wanted the curls
to be really really curly you could do
that but I just went ahead and get my
makeup and stuff so I'm just kind of
drying it again and playing with it and
my hair like I said it's not very
naturally curly so some ins did not curl
as well as the others so to fix those
I'm going to take the bitty way crater
which I got at Walmart for about $30
it's the perfect curling iron to go
along with any wavy curly hair I just oh
I love it love it love it so that's what
I'm using all my ends and just all
little pieces around my head and that's
it this curling one is awesome and it
just looks great to touch up any spots
that did not curl as well so I love it
and don't forget to take your
texturizing spray and just spray it over
your hair and kind of mint you know the
pieces together any flyaways you might
have and in the end this is what it
should look like I love it I think it's
so cute and big and voluminous I'm just
obsessed with this so send me a picture
to my Facebook or Twitter if you guys
end up trying it out thank you guys so
so much for watching and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
