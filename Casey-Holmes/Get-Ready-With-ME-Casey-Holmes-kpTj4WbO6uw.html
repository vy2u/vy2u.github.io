get ready with me and I was getting
ready to film and just get him ready for
the day so I figured I would follow
myself doing this because there is a new
BH Cosmetics palette out and I wanted to
play with it today so this is the Pride
and Prejudice zombies I cheat palette um
based on a new movie and I really like
the colors in this it's mostly a
shimmery look but there is some Mac in
here as well just to kind of even it all
out but I really like it I've been
really loving smokey looks again I go
through phases where I'm like I don't
want to put on a lot of makeup and then
I go through phases where I'm like I
want a almost black smokey eye everyday
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I will have all the products
listed in the description box below and
if you like get ready with me give it a
thumbs up so I know and I think that's
it so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
hope you don't mind the workout attire
I'm about to go change now and film some
more videos so if you wear workout
clothes like everyday more than regular
clothes let me know in the comments
because I know I do
it's very hard to Queen Gala leggings
anyways I'm gonna quit talking and let's
just get started with this video so the
first thing I'm going to do is take my
Charlotte Tilbury contour palette I'm
gonna take the shade shade and I'm going
to put this into my crease with a fluffy
blending brush just so we have a nice
transition shade
then I'm going to take this new palette
from BH Cosmetics and I'm going to go
ahead and take this shade right here
which is kind of like a grey blue and
I'm going to put this into the crease
and a little bit on the lid as well
I'm gonna take this black this black is
really really nice it blends out very
well and it is so pigmented so what I'm
gonna do is take a blending brush and
I'm going to basically do small circular
circular motions on the outer half of my
eye and slowly work that black into the
crease and also a little bit more on the
outer half of that lid I really want to
keep this black on the outer like corner
the outer V but I am gonna blend it a
little bit onto the lid just so
everything fades really nicely and I
will go back in a little bit later to
add more to really define that black and
make it look really nice and intense so
then I'm gonna take this color right
here and I'm gonna put this on my lid
this is like a purple gray it's very
very pretty and it has some shimmer in
it
but I'm gonna put this all over my lid
and I'm gonna take it to that black and
all the way up into the crease so just
go ahead and pack that color on with
however much you want
then I'm gonna take that same brush we
use with the black and I'm just gonna
blend this into the crease I didn't put
any extra products on it I'm just using
whatever is on the brush and blending
everything out and just doing little
circular motions just to make sure it
all blends together
I'm gonna go back in with that black and
take a smaller more defined brush and
I'm gonna again just touch up this outer
V and really deepen it up
then we're gonna take off the tape and
then take a makeup remover wipe and get
everything that may have fallen over
that tape and then I'm gonna take my
black eyeliner and I'm just going to
line my upper lash line I'm not doing a
wing or anything like that then I'm
taking these Luxy lashes and Westside
these are gorgeous they're really fluffy
and full and I found these on Instagram
and I've been really enjoying them so
now I'm taking the benefit Porefessional
matte rescue and I'm gonna put this on
my face it really smooths everything out
it makes everything nice and easy to
work with
I'm gonna use my regular primers and my
Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation with
this Marc Jacobs brush I got this brush
over Christmas and I really really love
it I think it blends this foundation so
well I just it's amazing so you only
need a little bit of this foundation I
honestly could have like left out a
daughter too but I just had a towel and
I was wiping off any excess product but
this blends really well if you have
stuff to cover up I highly recommend
this foundation because it covers
everything so I'm gonna take my Urban
Decay Naked skin and just put this
underneath my eyes on the sides of my
nose on the top of my lip my chin and my
forehead just to highlight and really
brighten up my face
I'm going to dip into my toothpaste
contour palette I haven't used this in a
really long time but I'm gonna use this
color I think it's called light cocoa
and I'm just gonna set my face with this
and I liked it it wasn't super yellow or
anything it just looked really nice and
brightening underneath the eyes and in
the center of the face I just put this
everywhere that I put concealer then I'm
gonna take one of my favorite bronzers
it's Mac's give me Sun I always end up
bringing this in somehow throughout the
years I just love it it's one of my
favorite warm toned bronzers and right
now I'm using it with a duo fiber brush
and I'm just gonna warm up the face and
then I'm gonna go ahead and contour it
with that Charlotte Tilbury palette
again and this shade color is so
beautiful it's the perfect amount of
warmth and ashy tones like it is such a
good product I really recommend it if
you love contouring and you're looking
for the next best thing
this is definitely it it's gorgeous then
I'm taking this cap on the blush duo and
hansel and gretel and I'm taking the
lighter shade and I'm just going to put
this on my cheeks and blend it back then
for highlight I'm gonna take the one
that is in the BH Cosmetics palette and
I really like this it's an interesting
kind of highlighter it's like a darker
champagne color but it looks really
beautiful on the skin and it is very
pigmented so I'm just gonna put this on
the tops of my cheeks a little bit on
the end of my eyebrow and down the
center of my nose and on my lip on my
Cupid's bow not like my whole lip then
I'm gonna take this creamy shade I'm
gonna highlight underneath my brows I
did fill in my brows with the anasazi a
dip brow but I can't find that clip
right now so I did fill them in and then
just highlighted right underneath there
then I'm taking my NARS eyeliner and I'm
just gonna go ahead and line my
waterline to really deepen up this look
and then to really smoke it out I'm
gonna take this black and press it up
against my lower lash line I pretty much
pack this black on it was really really
intense and I loved it and then what I
did is I lightly blended out the edges
with that shade color in the Charlotte
Tilbury palette and I didn't blend it
like so much where it was dragged down a
lot like I usually do
I kept it right there at that lower lash
line and it looked
so great so just kind of focus on
blending out the edges of it and you'll
be good to go then I'm gonna add some
mascara to my bomb lashes this is the
benefit roller lash and then for my lip
liner I'm using this one from the Urban
Decay Gwen Stefani collab I forget the
name but I will leave it down below for
you guys I like it it's basically the
color of my lips whenever I wipe my lip
balm off and then I'm gonna take max
what is this blankety max blankety and
put that on my lips and then I'm going
in with the lipgloss set from this movie
collab and I'm gonna take the lighter
pink and put that on top and then you
are all done so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and all the products I
mentioned will be listed in the
description box below and I will see you
all in my next video bye guys
