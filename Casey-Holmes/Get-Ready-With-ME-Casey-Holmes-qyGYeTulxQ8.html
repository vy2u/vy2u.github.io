the description box below it'll be the
first link in that description box and
yeah if you're wondering why I'm horse
Lake this weekend I was wakeboarding
Mama's a hot mess you see these hands
but I got up so hey I'm officially a
wakeboard girl I'm pretty excited about
it but off topic a lot so let's just go
ahead and get started with this tutorial
so I'm going in with my NARS eyeshadow
primer and just priming my eyelids for
the shadow that we're going to use the
first one is this Sephora collection I
shadow in lazy afternoon this is a nice
vanilla shade so we're just going to put
this all over the lid to set that base
and make sure all the other eyeshadows
slide on smoothly
next up I'm going to take Sephora
collection eyeshadow and lazy Ortoli
danger in paradise and I'm going to put
this into my crease it's a great
mid-tone Brown perfect for the crease
and a great way to blend up the
eyeshadows towards the brow so I'm just
going to put this in my crease and a
little bit above my crease all the way
from inner corner to outer corner and
kind of creating that outer V shape as
well going in with Urban Decay ultimate
Naked basics palette when I take this
plummy Brown and I'm going to focus this
into the crease and the outer V I want
to keep most of the product on the outer
V and then just drag the excess in just
so it's not too harsh in the crease but
there's still that definition there so I
am going to put it a little bit above my
crease as well but I'm not going above
the mid-tone Brown that we had just put
on so I take it all the way in towards
the inner part of my brow and then just
blend it all out again keeping most of
that product on the outer V
then I'm going to take the black in the
palette and I'm just going to put this
in the outer V and basically what I'm
going to do is create a V shape so I'm
going to have a little bit of space in
between the two lines but I'm going to
smudge it above my upper lashes and then
take it directly into the crease I'm not
going to fill in that space that you're
seeing right there because we're going
to put an eyeshadow there so just blend
it again across that upper lash line and
into the upper part of your crease and
it's literally just a v-shape and I love
the way this looks it kind of creates a
faux winged eyeliner effect which I like
especially if you have more downturned
eyes this will help lift your eye
especially if you put false lashes on so
now we're going in with a Too Faced
glitter glue and I'm going to put this
all over my lid everywhere that I had
that list space open I'm going to put
this there and then I'm going in with a
Sephora collection eye shadow again this
one has a little bit of glitter in it so
this adhesive is going to help all that
stick to the lid and the name of this
before collection eyeshadow is called
what happens in Vegas the very
appropriate name for this eyeshadow
because super sparkly but what I like
about this is it's not too intense it's
a very wearable sparkly eyeshadow so all
you have to do is just press it on top
of that two-faced glitter glue and all
that glitter is going to stick all day
long and it just looks so pretty it
gives it some extra glam without being
too intense then I'm just going to take
a little bit of excess product that I
have and then just blend out the crease
so we don't have any harsh lines I like
to do this one eye at a time because you
don't want the Too Faced glitter glue to
dry so that's why I'm just working one
eye at a time because I like to make
sure it's nice and tacky so I can go
ahead and put on that eye shadow and it
sticks all day
so next I'm taking for a collection
colorful week it felt liner that is in
waterproof and it is black and all I'm
doing is I'm just lining my upper lash
line I'm not doing a wing since we did
do that outer V but I'm just going to
line the upper lashes just so it gives
some more definition then I'm adding on
the velour lashes and I love these I
love allure lashes they're just so
awesome and then I'm taking my canon
austin primer and just priming my face
one of my favorite primers I really like
it and then moving on I'm taking Sephora
collections perfection foundation that's
a tongue twister but it's a really great
foundation it is full coverage I mean
look at how it's covering up all my
redness it's insane
so I just apply this all over with a
Beauty Blender I'm going it was a for
collection bright future gel serum
concealer and I'm going to apply this
underneath my eyes and down the center
of my face just the highlight this has a
nice yellow tone to it which I really
like it really helps brighten up this
look and my under eyes so I just like to
apply it all over my face and then draw
on my face
showing you guys my muscles because the
B blender literally makes you work my
photo does anybody else feel like that
it's crazy so moving on to the setting
powder I'm using Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder again with
the same Beauty Blender and just setting
everything
I'm taking the benefit cobra out and I'm
going to fill in my brows I love this
pomade it's really easy to work with and
the shade I'm using is number three and
I'm using a tart brush just to fill it
in
now I'm taking the benefit through the
brow tones I love this lightly just to
highlight the brows and make them look a
little bit more natural and match my
hair so I'm going to go ahead and apply
that then I'm going to dust away the
baking that we just did and then we're
going to move on to bronzer so I'm
taking Sephora collection bronzer in
dark I really like this one because it's
again that perfect shade it's kind of
like a mixture between warm and cool
toned so you can use it to bronze you
can use to contour it's a great
versatile bronzer and it's great to have
one like that in your collection that
you can use to bronze up the face and
also contour so now I'm taking Sephora
collection blush and hated and I'm just
going to apply that to my cheeks and
then for highlighter I'm actually using
an eyeshadow this is Sephora collection
under the cover eye shadow it has a nice
shimmery look to it and it's kind of
like a icy highlighter it's really
really pretty and I just use my Anasazi
a brush to put that on my face so I'm
going to put it on top of my cheekbones
my Cupid's bow and down the center of my
nose and I'm also taking it underneath
my brow just to highlight and lift that
up now taking Sephora collection coal
pencil in matte black and I'm just going
to line my lower lash line this thing is
super black you guys and really easy to
blend out I've been loving it so I'm
going to apply that and then I'm going
to go in with eyeshadow from the Urban
Decay ultimate Naked basics palette
which is that first shade we use well
not first but the frigid are good shade
that we use and I'm going to press this
up against my lower lash line then I'm
going back with that mid-tone shade from
Sephora collection and I'm just going to
blend this out so it's not too harsh
then I'm going to apply mascara and that
will complete the eye look and then next
up is lips which I've been really
enjoying this product I think it is so
pretty it's the for collection and cream
lip stain and I love this so much it is
so beautiful and I didn't have to use a
lip liner with it it was just so easy to
work with and it dries down to a matte
finish it's not like a liquid lipstick
but I don't know it's so comfortable and
it lasts for such a long time I love it
in this color I feel like just adds a
little bit of color to the Lugg makes it
pop it makes a little bit more fun so
that is a completed look I hope you guys
enjoy it thank you so much for watching
and I will see you all in my next video
