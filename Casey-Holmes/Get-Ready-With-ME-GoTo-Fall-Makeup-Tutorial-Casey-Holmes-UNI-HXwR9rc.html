getting ready with me um actually like
completely getting ready I need to get
ready to film some videos and I want to
run some errands because I'm going out
of town tomorrow I was gonna use a
different palette but I realized it
doesn't come out until October 4th so um
I would decide to just do something
different to show you guys like my go-to
fall look so I'm gonna be using this
morphe 35c palette i know these colors
are intimidating but these matte shades
down here are really beautiful
so the first shade we're gonna go in
with this one right here these are just
really nice warm matte shades and I like
them and I like these morphe palettes I
was gonna use the 3500 but I haven't
checked if that has been back in stock
because of all the issues they were
having so I figured I would just go with
this one which is like a basic one easy
to get a hold of you are interested in
it this one's gonna be a little bit
different since I have another shadow on
here but yeah it was I was in ezel lorac
mega Pro the lorac Pro mega 2 palette I
just I figured we're in September yes
but I just didn't want to you know put
it out and you guys wait a long time to
get it so and then I'm gonna go in with
this shade right here which is like a
really pretty mustard yellow and I'm
gonna put that into the crease as well
but with a smaller blending brush so I'm
gonna use this one for Mac it's a 217 I
love like a little mustard yellow looks
like this I think they're really
gorgeous for my like go to fall look I
still like a semi smokey eye more warm
tones of course but I'm I mean like I
would want really really really really
warm colors cuz I'm gonna actually use
this orange here in a second but I like
very very warm colors with like a darker
brownish lip for this fall and smoking
out that lower lash line per usual just
because I will assess now I'm gonna take
this orange in here I'm going to put
that right on top of where we just put
that yellow I don't want too much orange
I just want that warmth in there
NOLs an and this just looks like fault
to me I love it so I'm going out of town
tomorrow I will be gone for a week so
I'm pre filming some videos right now
and yeah it's really exciting I'm
excited to be gone I'm this is like my
last time going out of town for a few
weeks so I'm really kind of excited
about that and excited to kinda like get
my life back in order okay now I'm gonna
take this shade right there to put that
in the outer half and blend it into the
crease just a little bit just like that
don't take it in all the way in the
crease just keep it mainly on the outer
half and drag a little bit in the crease
but yeah this is the last time I'm going
out of town for a few weeks excited I'm
excited to go and spend some time with
my boyfriend and his family but I'm also
excited to come home after that week and
really get some stuff done and get my
house like back in order because I feel
like I've been out of town so much these
past couple months and my house just
needs to get back in order and we need
to get it together it's you know fall is
here it's coming up and I'm just like so
pumped it's already been a little bit
chilly here in Georgia so good because I
have been wanting it to be chilly I'm so
ready to do like fall fashion and
everything I come outside my door my
bedroom and have a bunch of wallflowers
downstairs and all of that like with the
fall since I haven't really gotten up to
upstairs yet but I have them all set
downstairs and when I walk out I can
immediate smell like flannel and leaves
because I have all different kinds of
mix throughout the house and it just
smells so good good I'm so obsessed with
it like I'm just so in love my new
favorite scent is vanilla pumpkin
marshmallow is that what it's called I
can't remember but I will leave it down
below it's oh so good and first one that
was gonna be too sweet no not at all it
smells amazing
I'm gonna take that kind of mustard
yellow again and blend out the edge of
this brown
I'm like I'm not ready for Christmas I'm
just like ready for fall you know and
thank the Lord it's almost October and
wants October comes you know all the
good shows come on all the old movies
oh speaking of like older movies and
shows have you guys seen I don't know if
this is a rumor but I'm pretty sure it's
not that Nickelodeon is gonna dedicate a
show to like all the nineties cartoons
stop stop that is amazing I'm so excited
about it I mean if you're not excited
about that I'm sorry but I'm like so
excited about it and I hope they
actually do it I think they're gonna
have like Hey Arnold Rugrats so like
that I read it somewhere I wish they
would have CatDog but I don't know if
they're gonna have cat dog or not that
was like will make their shows everyone
younger it's so good now I'm actually
going to take this white shade right
here and put this in the inner part of
the lid with a fluffier brush just like
that kind of blend it out and you want
to get about halfway kind of meet that
darker Brown then what I'm gonna do and
then blend out the rest of that with
that orange that we used right there so
take it into the crease onto the brown
and just kind of like put it right there
in the center just so there's a little
bit of orange in there just to blend it
out I was thinking the other day like I
was just wandering looking at videos and
thinking I wonder how people have found
my videos like what videos what video
did you watch that said hey let me
subscribe to her like what was it so let
me know in the comments what video was
the first one you saw of me or the first
one that you're like hey I wanna
subscribe to her because I'm really
interested in hearing about that because
I just find it intriguing you know I
just find the song drinking and now I'm
gonna take a little bit of this black
and I'm going to really am I gonna do
this
you know I didn't even clean a pencil
brush okay anyway so we're gonna take
that black with a pencil brush now we're
just gonna kind of just this right out
me here and take it and like so so we're
basically doing a winged eyeliner with
this black so extend it out and just
kind of blend all the way in and you
could take your finger and hold your lid
just to help it blend a little bit more
then I'm gonna go back in with the first
shade we used and we're just gonna
balloon it out a little bit more
it'll all come together I promise it
looks like really messy right now but
it'll all come together so do the same
thing on the other eye let's do like
you're doing a weave
this matte black is really dark no the
really light shading the inner corner
was kind of pointless but what are we
gonna do okay so after that school ended
out you can go in with your yeah I told
luckily I only spent like 15 minutes in
there which is great because I went in
there just to get some stuff which is
what I did but I did good old huh I want
to this adds like a little something
like a little smokiness right above the
liner it's nothing crazy but it just
adds a little something different and
since we did pretty much do just like a
winged liner with the shadow you don't
have to do a wings liner with a liquid
liner but I just like to do it because
it just helps lift my eyes even more and
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
apply liner to my top waterline and then
I'm going to apply these lashes but Koko
lashes these are in goddess these are my
favorite I love them so much I ordered
literally five pairs of them because
they're my favorite lashes so I'm gonna
fly these and then I will be right back
okay so these so this is what it looks
like with them on see it's really simple
but it's just like really warm and smoky
yes but not as smoky that could be
because I could be a little smoked here
but I went ahead and applied my I went
ahead and plied my face primers the
Smashbox photo finish primer the primer
water and then the of course of
organizing one which these are my
favorites right now just because I
really I don't know they're just really
good and it's hard for me to get away
from something if it's like really
working for me so now I'm gonna apply my
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation I
always gonna say better than sex and
it's not that I mean the mascara oh my
gosh I can't even so I'm all out of warm
beige so I also have to use honey to
kind of match my face to my fake tan let
me take my
which looks really weird doesn't it look
weird it looks longer and then blend
everything out
I love foundation I think foundation is
like one of the most fun parts of makeup
like I think face makeup is just the
best because you can transform your face
okay so I need to know who is watching
Real Housewives of Orange County what
are you thinking right now do you think
Brooks has cancer do you not think he
has cancer
what do you think I have had questions
asked and I just I can't I I don't know
I would hate to think he was faking it
so I would never want to say like yeah
totally without any proof you know but I
find it awfully fishy that they broke up
I would like to know well this is what
happens when you get on reality TV shows
you have nosy people like me who are
like okay why did they break up
after the season you know because they
are broken up right now she went like
this huge announcement or they both did
and said they both would wish each other
happiness well why are you both like I
wonder if it's just because people were
ragging them or what why did you guys
break up Megan is just crazy mess I felt
bad for her husband Jim because he's
like so not interested in any of the
drama going on but he keeps getting
pulled into it bless his heart he has
like this sourpuss look on his face like
if I was his wife honestly from what
I've seen on TV I wouldn't want to be
with him like I wouldn't be his wife
just from what I've seen on TV he seems
very like I don't know not very loving
you know I was watching my fab 40
Bravo's like my obsession I love Bravo
whenever I get the chance to like sit
down and watch it i watch the helmet of
Bravo but I was watching my fab 40 which
is like one of the newer shows that they
have and this one girl she they put the
husband's planned a surprise party for
both of their wives and the wives both
didn't know they thought were they were
planning it for each other without the
others knowing it's like a really big
thing they pulled it off but one of the
girls she's like she looks like she's so
sweet I mean the way she talked his
stuff she was very soft-spoken she came
out her dress she looked absolutely
stunning and I forget what happened but
when she came out he was like
like to me I want my husband to be like
you look so beautiful you know what I
mean when I first showed my boyfriend my
dress for weight ring week and he was
like oh my god you look amazing
his reaction was perfect but her husband
like he was just like oh yeah you look
great like it was very like it wasn't
very sentimental you know when I was
kind of hoping for oh wow baby you look
amazing you know I kind of felt bad but
she looked absolutely beautiful and
that's been a cool show to watch I don't
see how they spent a hundred thousand
dollars and the wives not knowing but
hey you guys you got it gonna get it is
a TV show so I really shouldn't like too
far into it oh and ladies of London is
my favorite now I have certain love
ladies of London because they're so
amazing I just own that I find it so
interesting like I want to move to
London and just hang out with them
what's your favorite shows now is there
some favorite shows on Bravo I'm waiting
for southern charm to come back on TV
that's like one of my favorite shows
just because it's you know it's got
southern people on it and it's not like
what's that one show down south it's not
like party down south
I don't watch stuff like that but like
southern charm I really enjoy now so sad
when that ended so I'm ready for that to
come back and I really don't watch
anything on other TV shows because I
just I find it hard I don't know
I don't ever switch my channel for Bravo
and that's not a joke like I never ever
touch it it always stays that Bravo like
I don't even know my remote is right now
that's how bad it is so I'm gonna take
this G Vashi powder in matte translucent
and it's in Universal nude I love this
I've mentioned it before it's really
great for oily skin and I'm gonna use my
Beauty Blender I'm gonna talk to this
onto the lid I'm gonna use my Beauty
Blender and take some of that product
and this is how we're gonna set our eyes
does this happen set my face makeup
lately just sending it with the Beauty
Blender cuz I find it just melts into
the skin best and it looks more flawless
but this part looks flawless anyways but
still okay this Too Faced eyeliner is
running
like hell all my eyes that is not good
now I'm gonna take this Smashbox bronzer
this is in suntan matte and I just love
this bronzer I tend to go back to it
gonna use this morphe g7 just bronzer
face with this I usually use a matte
kabuki which a lot of you asked me about
that kabuki I got it from a CCO
um last year and I don't think it's
available but it's one of the best
cookies I've ever had in my life I love
it for bronzer yeah that's where I got
it from if you're ever wondering where
the black kabuki from like the black
handle and everything is from Mac try to
check out ccos because that's worthy oh
hi okay and then to contour I'm gonna
use the Too Faced chocolate Soleil this
is like a staple this is a new one I
think yeah oh no it's dipped in it a
couple times but I'm gonna use this
brush I've never use this brush before
it's the makeup geek angled contour
brush I just want to try it out and see
how nice it is usually I use my NARS
eita brush cuz I really like that brush
I'm what I was chairs in Yemen ours okay
so I need to know do any of you guys
have like okay I don't know if they're
called hoverboards or what but do you
guys have those little hoverboards that
you stand on and you just like
everywhere I know you know what I'm
talking about
I've been wanting one but like I have
carpet so I really don't think it's
smart for me to even get one but they
just look so fun and I just want one I
don't think I'll ever get one but I
bought my boyfriend a drone and I'm so
excited for those because I he checked
one out over the weekend because
something happened to his so he has to
get a new one but I thought it'd be so
cool to do like a day in my life video
while I'm up there where he's at so you
guys can kind of check out the
surroundings and stuff and I just have
like cool visions in my head for the
video I'm gonna take this blush called
amber by NYX this is really pretty isn't
it I just pulled it out they sent me a
bunch of different lipstick
or not lipsticks bunch of different
makeup products and this is one of them
this is just pretty so again this is an
Amber and I'm just gonna put that on my
cheeks this might be a blush that goes
with me because it's pretty I'm gonna
take the mary lou manizer from the balm
i haven't used this and so long I'm just
gonna dust this like very
ever-so-slightly
on my face because it's tough isn't it
okay so our face is done I'm gonna go
quickly do my eyebrows and I'll be back
to finish up this look for you guys I'm
gonna take this shade right here and by
Make Up For Ever called one five to
eight and I'm gonna put this underneath
my brows I'm also going to pack it into
the inner corner as well because a
really shimmery anter corner has been in
lately and you know what I'm not mad
about it so I put that right there
it just brightens it up and it's a
warmer color so it looks so good with
these warm shadows and like I said I'm
gonna apply this really heavily in the
inner corner right here hopefully my
eyeliner doesn't ruin it later but I'm
gonna take this Rimmel nude eyeliner and
I'm gonna line my waterline I've had the
hardest time trying to sharpen this
thing and it looks disgusting look at it
and then playing that just so it's not
like too dark on the lash line and then
I'm going to take a brush like this this
is the Sigma small angled brush and then
I take that black we used seven there in
it oh it does bonus I'm gonna take that
matte black with that angle brush and
we're gonna put this right up against
our lower lashes you just want to kind
of draw it I was gonna do like an
everyday look and this is not turning
into an everyday look what's new for me
right okay now I'm gonna take a pencil
brush and I'm gonna take that first day
we used right here and just lightly
blend out this on the lower lash that
black right there I'm gonna lightly
blend it out
nothing too crazy I just want to make
sure it's not too harsh
make sure you extend that out towards
that um wings liner that we did as well
sorry I'm so far away but I can't see
any glasses if you really wanna make
this look even more intense you could
also add false lashes to your bottom
lashes but I don't like to do that I
feel like I have long lashes as it is so
there's no need for me to like go
cray-cray with it okay now I'm moving on
to lips I'm gonna take this circle lip
liner I believe I got this at Target
sea-ice RCA I cannot smell today I'm
just gonna line my lips some of my
favorite lip liners to really get that
heart shape right here I don't know just
really glides easily and it's it's in
the color toffee it's really good for
like any lip color and then for the star
of the show is this NYX matte lipstick
in Eurotrash oh my god I'm obsessed with
this color you guys and so obsessed oh
so it's just like a pink
taupe color and I'm gonna add a little
bit more Brown on top just to go with
the eyes but it's a gorgeous color or
like look at that that's like a perfect
everyday lip color for me I feel like
I'm gonna take this bucks I'm revealed
and put this on top just to give it a
little more Brown I really like these -
what are these called the lip foundation
the true nude lip foundation Browns are
really cool I like these about
themselves too but pretty easy to do
nothing too crazy with the eyes um
just nice and warm just what I like for
a fall and winter time I like a nice
warm and I like of course smokey eyes
smokey eyes my favorite one thing I will
stay out of this video I did try that
two-faced eyeliner where did it go I
tried that two-faced eyeliner and was
not impressed by I think I actually did
it off camera to quit on the city
but it was some sort of two-faced
waterproof eyeliner and it did not work
for me it's like running right down here
on me and it's only gonna get underneath
my lower eyelashes I can already tell so
not a fan of that that's one thing I'm
not a fan of but everything else I do
like I like the morphe palette I think
it's great and it's great for Halloween
too because it has a bunch of different
colors in it they don't I'm not
sponsored by them to do this video I'm
just simply saying because it has so
many colors in it you could easily use
this for Halloween or just like
day-to-day uses and you could do a nice
neutral eye with pop color or a pop
color and then have these to blend
everything out so yeah it's a 35c so
yeah I'm gonna fix my hair and put
another top on and film another video
for you guys so I hope you enjoyed this
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you guys in my next video
