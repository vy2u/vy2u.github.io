be sharing it with you this makeup look
I just got ready I'm about to actually
head out the door so I figured I would
film this for you guys because I have
quite a few new products that I was
trying out you'll notice that I like
popped open a bunch of boxes um oh and
hello toss the ball on the floor I
popped open a lot of boxes from like NYX
and I also I'm so organized it's just so
good but I also use this awesome
buxom palette which is really cool
because you can don't like a messy desk
you can create your own palette and I
mean it doesn't this look like a palette
that I would create like I picked my own
shades for this palette this is my own
custom palette and these are the colors
that I use today and I love love love
these it's so amazing and all you do is
just pop them out like this and then
it's really easy just to pop these in
and out I kind of don't want to get them
all over my fingers cuz I'll get all
over my shirt but I'll show you in the
beginning of the tutorial it is really
pretty it's exactly what I love I have
one two three four five wait one two
three four five matte shades in one
shimmer shade and yeah I just love them
of course they're more warm and they're
just they're just everything that I love
so this is the palette going to use in
the video and I think I used like I said
I used some other new products but
figured I would also show you guys my
outfit so umm yeah obviously I did my
hair straight because I've been really
lazy lately and don't want to do it but
this is my outfit if you're interested
this top is from Free People I'm
obsessed with it because it's just so
fun and fringy and it's like my favorite
thing ever and it is kind of like it
shows some skin which is why I haven't
worn it because I haven't felt like
really comfortable if you watched my
last Q&amp;amp;A you probably know that I just
haven't felt like comfortable but
tonight I'm feeling really good for some
reason so I figured I would bring this
little guy out and wear it and I'm just
obsessed with this top and grab stodgy
rows these pants are from Ragan bone
them I wear these a lot I love the
distress look of them and they have like
the kind of girlfriend trend and then my
heels are from Zara so this is my outfit
I'm just going to carry like a Tory
Burch crossbody and we'll be done so
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
I really hope you enjoy it I love this
look it's just what I really like to do
if I'm going out is doing a lighter
color on the inner corner just to really
open up my eyes instead of closing them
off I love a good solid smokey eye but
sometimes I like to have a little bit of
lightness in the inner corner just to
brighten everything up so thank you guys
so much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this video and if you want to see how I
got this look then just keep watching
okay so here I'm showing you how the
palette just pops out and you can take
these eyeshadows in and out really
easily and these are just the ones that
I chose they do have 40 different shades
that you can choose from and what's
really cool about these is that they are
primer infused and that means you don't
have to prep with a primer before you
put these eyeshadows on for them to stay
put and also a one more fact for you
guys if you don't want to put together a
palette by yourself they do have three
pre-made ones that you can pick up as
well so I took the vanilla shade and I
put that all over my eyelid and then I'm
taking this shade right here and I'm
going to put this into the crease and a
little bit in the outer corner I'm using
a blending brush that has a little bit
more of a tapered end just so this you
know color doesn't get all over the lid
you know what I mean I wanted it more
precise and just more into the crease so
this is just gonna add a little bit of
depth and I love this brush it's really
really great and I talked about it in my
favorites video so definitely check it
out but I just I'm obsessed so just
blend blend blend and you can blend it
up a little bit higher just to make sure
it kind of fades up towards the brow
okay so now I'm going to take this red
brick kind of shade and I'm going to
take a fluffier brush and I'm going to
put this on the lid I'm going to use it
more on the outer half of the lid and
just blend it in towards the center I
just want to focus this color mainly on
the outer half because we are going to
put a lighter color in the inner corner
just to really open up and brighten up
the eyes and if you have like downturned
eyes or really small eyes sometimes
having harsh colors all over will really
close up the eyes but as long as we keep
the inner corner really light it looks
really really good so I just put that
all over that lid and left the inner
corner bare and then we're going to take
this black right here with a pencil
brush and we're just going to focus this
on the outer half we're not going to
bring it in really far at all
this is just going to add a little bit
more dimension and depth into the look
and then after you've applied that we're
just going to take the same brush and
the red brick kind of shade and blend
that out
the key to this is just going back in
and blending putting more color than
blending some more and you just want it
to look more of like a faded look just
all the colors kind of blending in
together going from a lightest to
darkest and I think the black is kind of
essential just because it really does
add that depth it doesn't make it super
super smoky but it definitely you know
makes it a little bit more sultry than
if we didn't put it on there at all and
we're going to take these two shades
right here I'm going to mix a little bit
of the shimmer shade in with the matte
highlight and we're going to put this in
the inner corner and again just blend
this to about the center part of your
lid just so it all kind of fades nicely
then to make everything look nice and
smooth I'm going to take a smaller brush
and that redbrick kind of shade again
and I'm just going to blend this more on
the center of the lid just to kind of
fade everything and make it look nice
and smooth then I'm just going to go
ahead and take off the tape and you have
a nice sharp clean line and then I'm
using this NYX matte liquid liner I do
like this eye I prefer the gel next
liner over it but I do like it I think
it is nice so I just did a winged
eyeliner and applied some lashes from
velour and then I come back to this
Estee Lauder Double Wear I feel like I
always go back to it just cuz it's
stunning so I'm using a makeup geek
brush that I'm obsessed with
and I'm applying this all over my skin
and then after that I'm just going to do
my normal concealer routine I do the
same thing pretty much every single time
so I kind of wanted just to go quickly
over this I'm just putting the concealer
underneath my eyes in the center of the
face and then I'll also go back in and
put some concealer on the center of my
nose just to highlight that area so when
we contour it later it looks a little
bit slimmer
i'm taking this nyx powder and cream and
this is a great setting powder for
underneath the eyes it has a little bit
of a yellow tint but not too much and
it's a really fine smooth powder I ended
up really really enjoying this so
definitely recommend it I think you can
buy it at Ulta I'm not sure but I think
you can get an online for sure then I'm
using this hourglass bronzer that when
you look at it I'm telling you you're
like it's okay it looks kind of basic
but once you put it on your skin oh I've
been so obsessed with you guys it's Gor
just so I'm just gonna go ahead and
bronze my face on my cheeks top the
forehead and a little bit around my neck
and jaw
now taking this beige cosmetics forever
nude palette I still adore this palette
I think it's absolutely amazing and I'm
gonna take the darkest shade and I'm
gonna contour with it the contour shade
has more of an ashy tone to it so it
looks really nice and it looks more of
like a shadow instead of like an orange
streak across your face so I really
really like it a lot I still recommend
this palette
in this elf blush palette in light and
I'm taking my favorite shade which is
this one right here
I love these blush palettes from ELF I
think they're beautiful and this shade
obviously it's super super warm and it
just looks beautiful with this look it
has like an orange tone to it oh my god
I'm so in love with it you guys it's a
really smooth powder and then it's
really easy to blend out as well so
highly recommend the elf blush palettes
I have both of them taking this Estee
Lauder highlighter that is discontinued
but hopefully one day they bring it back
because it's amazing it's in the
heatwave I'm just gonna highlight with
this it's been like my go-to right now
and then I'm doing my brows with the NYX
eyebrow gel and then we're just going to
go ahead and move on to eyeliner i'm
taking this nyx eyeliner in brown and
i'm just going to line my waterline and
then we're gonna take that black and
smudge this underneath the lower lash
line right there close to the lashes and
i'm just using a small more precise
brush to do this since black is such a
harsh color we're going in with a pencil
brush and that red brick shade and we're
going to blend it out take your time
with this black is a more time-consuming
color to blend out but as long as you
take your time with it and keep blending
and adding a little bit more color it
will blend out and look really really
nice
taking the vanilla shade and I'm going
to put this underneath my brows this is
a beautiful highlight it just made such
huge difference I think it's so gorgeous
I'm just touching up my liner and I
added a little bit of bottom mascara or
bottom white what am i doing what am i
drawing say add a little bit of mascara
to my bottom lashes and then moving on
to my favorite part it is the lip
product and this has been another go-to
product and this is actually called the
buxom lip foundation but I'm obsessed
with the tip of it because it's kind of
angled
so you don't have to use a lip liner
with this it's really easy just to get a
nice precise line with your lips and I
am so in love with it like I think it
looks beautiful this color is stunning
so in love I just a can't and it's a
matte shade too I'm really into matte
darker nude or just darker warm shades
I know it's summer but y'all I can't get
away from these shades
so yeah this lasted all night on me as
well and it looked really great
throughout the night so highly highly
highly recommend it
and then after that I'm just gonna do my
hair and then I am done so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and I will see you all
in my next video bye
I had my ears pierced I had two holes in
each ear I've had my cartilage Pierce

pierced but I never did I think it just
depends if you want to get a piercing
