a get ready with me
and I'm so excited to show you guys this
video because I'm actually out here in
LA and I've never been to the Sunset
Strip before so I figured why not do it
get ready with me I know you all really
love them so that's what I'll be showing
you guys today you'll see hair and
makeup outfit everything and I will be
using this Smashbox full exposure
palette which I do really love is since
you have shimmer shades on top and matte
on bottom so it's really versatile and
another thing that's really great about
this palette is you do get this little
cheat sheet for your eyes if you don't
know what to do with your eyeshadow for
your eye shape then this will really
help you it takes you step-by-step and I
think it's very useful so if you're
interested in seeing my hair and make up
an outfit then just keep watching so
like I said earlier I'll be using these
Smashbox full exposure palette but first
we're gonna prime our eyes with a
Smashbox primer just so nothing creases
and it lasts all night long I'm going to
take this media matte brown shade and
put this into my crease this is going to
be our transition shade so I'm just
buffing this all over the lid and then
I'm taking the shade right above it it's
a really pretty sparkly medium brown
color and I will be putting this all
over the lid just to add some sparkle
and then I'll take the lightest shade
right next to it and put that in the
inner part of my eye just to really
brighten up the look and make my eyes
look a little bit more awake
then I'm going to be taking this deep
Matt Brown and placing this in the outer
V and also blending it a little bit into
my crease this will just add some
definition and really help smoke out the
look to make it even more deep and dark
I will be taking the black shade in the
palette with a pencil brush and putting
this in the very outer V I'm just gonna
focus this on the outer half and then
blend it in just so it's not too harsh
but you still have a little bit of
smokiness to the look time to take off
the tape and I'm going to go ahead and
put on some eyeliner of course I'm doing
winged eyeliner because it helps lift my
eyes up and I'm going to take this
pencil in line in the upper waterline
next it's time to apply some mascara
and also a false lashes because false
lashes will really help complete the
look
so next we're gonna do brows and this is
just gonna help frame your face and make
the makeup look look more put together
and then taking this cream shade on the
mat side I'm going to put this
underneath my brows to highlight going
back in I'm just going to be blending
everything because you guys know who I
am I have to blend all the time then
it's time to smoke out their lower
lashline I'm gonna be taking that darker
Brown that I used in the outer V and
I'll just be smoking this out on the
lower lash line then it's time to
contour apply blush and my highlighter
and then we're gonna do lipstick and lip
gloss and we are done with the makeup
look so after that I'm gonna get my
outfit together and put it on I love
this outfit I think it's super cute but
still kind of casual at the same time
and my hair was already curled I'm
running on like three day old hair so I
wanted to just touch up a few pieces so
it still looks a little bit messy and
bedhead and then I'm gonna put on my
shoes which I also love and it's time to
go out
