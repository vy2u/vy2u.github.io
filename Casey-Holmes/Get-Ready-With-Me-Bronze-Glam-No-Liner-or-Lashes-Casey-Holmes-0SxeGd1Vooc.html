with me it is on this look that I'm
wearing right now
super bronzed really easy there's no
liner no false lashes I love it I think
it's so fun for spring and summer and
what I really like about this is I have
downturned eyes so I always used to
think like I couldn't wear a lot of
colors in the crease and things like
that and on my lid without a liner and
some false lashes but that is totally
false so I really hope you enjoyed this
video it's just really bronzed easy fun
something you could do for everyday I'm
also going to show you guys like my bear
nail routine I know this sounds really
weird but I don't have enough time these
next few weeks to get my nails done so
when it's up to me to keep my nails done
there's a certain process that I do to
make sure that they still look shiny
without polish you can also do this
method and put polish on top it'll make
it really smooth but I personally love
bare nails that way I don't have to
worry about chipping or anything like
that and I love my nails to be super
short so I'm also going to show you what
I do with the ELMO pay this is like a
lifesaver
if you don't want to go to the nail
salon so if you guys want to see how I
got ready and the full process of
everything then let's just go ahead and
get started okay so the first thing
we're going to do is the nails since
it's the easiest and quickest to do so
I'm using this Elmo Pei nail care system
and I really like this it's three steps
and it's all labeled for you so the
first step is to file and a quick tip I
have learned from using this is you
definitely want to use it on the normal
setting you use the higher setting for
your toes and everything so you just
want to go side to side with this
product and you don't have to put down a
lot of pressure at all just a very light
amount to file down that nail and then
the next step is buff buffing is great I
also show you how to throughout this
video like what the nails look like
after I file them so that's what they
look like they just look like you went
to a nail salon and got the foul done
and then when you move on to buff the
buff is just going to help buff this out
and then the last step is shine which is
my favorite part because I don't have to
wear a clear gloss or anything when I
shine my nails it looks like you have a
clear gloss on but you don't I used to
have something like this back in the day
and when I found out there was one that
was electric because the one I used to
have was like a just a square thing once
I found out there's electric one I was
all about it it's just so easy to use
since it files bust and shines your
nails this
so does encourage healthy nail growth
which is amazing and even though I just
like to use it for bare nails you can do
this before you do a Polish and they'll
make it really nice and smooth so if you
like to do at-home manicures or just
take care of your nails yourself I think
this is a a must-have product okay so
moving on to makeup this is a really
simple makeup look but I wanted to show
you if you have downturned eyes that you
can rock a darker color in the crease I
know I didn't think I could for a while
because I feel like it made me look even
more tired in my eyes more downturned
but I'm going to show you how you can
avoid that so honestly the main step is
tape this tape is amazing put on the
back of your hand a couple times get
some of that sticky glue off and just
put that on and as long as you angle
this up from your lower lash line up to
your brow it will give you that angled
shadow going up and what it will do is
it will lift the eye even if you put a
darker color in the crease so I'm using
a few makeup geek shadows right now this
is more of a warm toned mustardy brown
color and I love it you guys I love
these colors and this is one of Megan
Pete's new shades and I wanted to play
with it because I was looking through
all the PR stuff that she sent and I saw
this one and I was like uh yes I need
this one in my life so I what I did is I
went in there first and I really lightly
put that in the crease and buffed it up
towards the brow more and then once I
had that all buffed out I did go in a
little bit more into the crease and just
define it to make it look a little bit
more deep then I'm going to take this
shade right here and I'm just going to
put this all over my lid later on I will
go in with fix+ and really amp this up
so you can see it better but if you even
want just a super light look I think
this is great and it's a really gorgeous
color I'll have all the colors listed
down below in the order that I use them
then I'm going to take this darker brown
shade it has some gold in it as well and
I'm going to take a more precise crease
brush I'm going to focus more in the
crease and I'm not going all the way
into the inner corner I'm just going to
keep it right there in the outer part
I'm going about halfway into my crease
and what I notice about this is a it
helps to find your crease and B does
make your eyes look a little bit bigger
because I go a little bit above my
crease just because I don't have a soup
to find one so I like to just do that
and then I'll go in with a blending
brush and just blend this out so we
don't have any harsh lines
and then like I said this is where I
went with mac fix+ in that color I used
all over the lid and I just packed that
on even more because it wasn't as
vibrant without the fixed clothes
going back in with that mustard brown
shade that we used in the beginning I am
just going to go back in and blend out
the edges I always go in after every
single color that I do and just blend
everything out to make sure we don't
have any harsh lines or jagged edges the
only pinch we share one of the great
things that I have in this tape on is
you can take it off and barium you have
a nice sharp line if you wanted to go
ahead and do liner with this look you
could do it and it would be nice and
precise with that tape and then I went
in with my waterproof mascara and my
regular primers and I'm just going to
use foundation I've been loving this
Smashbox foundation but it is way too
light for me so I had to go on with this
Marc Jacobs one which is still another
favorite I absolutely adore this
foundation and I love it with this
foundation brush from Marc Jacobs I
think it is by far the best way to apply
it it applies so evenly and smooth and I
know it looks super crazy right now but
this matches my body and my face is
super pale because I don't self tan my
face cuz I will like break out but I do
that and then I'm going in with my
concealer I'm sorry I just can't get
away from this concealer let me know
your favorite ones down below in the
comments whether it's trucks store
high-end I love this concealer I love
the consistency and I use a lot of it
but it never looks cakey so I just I
can't get away from it you guys I'm
sorry so I put that underneath my eyes
and down the center of my nose at per
usual look was up
only share to the less fun then it's
time to make ourselves super bronze and
I love this bronzer from urban decay if
you want to look like you just came back
on the beach this is the way to go I'm
obsessed with it I'm using a benefit
brush to bronze up the face so I'm going
to put this on the high points of my
forehead and also my cheeks and a little
bit underneath my chin then to contour
we're using an oldie but a goodie the
benefit hoola bronzer and this Real
Techniques brush I cannot get away from
this Real Techniques brush I think it's
just so good and it's super fluffy and
just really easy to use I mean it takes
no time to do my contour so I'm going to
put that in my contour line and then
also underneath my lip and I did contour
my nose with it as well and the tops of
my forehead
next up I wanted to use a rosy blush
this is Technicolor by lorac I was going
to either go for this kind of blush or a
more bronze blush but I decided to go
with this one because I like the flushed
look that it gives it kind of looks like
you had a little bit of Sun and then I'm
using the anasazi aglow kit and I forget
the one I have I think it's the warm
blue and I'm going to use her brush that
I purchased from Sephora which I love by
the way and I'm going to apply my
highlighter to the tops of my cheekbones
I'm kind of doing this heavily and I
love these two together they're so warm
and beautiful and if you're doing a
bronzed look I think these highlighters
are amazing because they have that warm
kind of golden glow to them and they
just go with you look so well so put it
on the cheekbones my nose my Cupid's bow
and it also Rock the yellow one into my
brow bone if you guys been watching me
for a while you know I love to rock the
same highlighter than wearing on my face
underneath my brow a lot of the time and
that's what I did today
and I really put a lot in the inner
corner as well to brighten that area up
then I'm using the NYX wonder pencil to
brighten up my eyes as well I'm putting
this on my waterline and this will also
help make your eyes look a little bit
bigger and a more awake and then I'm
going to take that golden brown shade we
used in the crease and I'm very lightly
putting this on my lower lash line so we
don't drag this look down even more
since we do have a darker color in the
crease and I have downturned eyes I'm
not doing a super smoked out lash line
I'm just very lightly putting out on the
bottom lash line to define it a little
bit but I'm not going crazy with it
because I don't want to accentuate how
downturned my eyes can be and smoke it
out even more you know what I'm saying
so just keep it light and then I put a
little bit mascara on and then this lip
liner is great this is by circa and it's
from Walgreens it's such a good liner
and I'm using this Too Faced melted
liquid lipstick I really like this
formulation I think it's great this
color was a little too light for me so I
ended up going over it with a Kylie lip
gloss in literally and I love the way
that it turned out I just thought it was
so pretty
and then next up is hair I'm not going
to spend too much time on it because I
just straightened it but a lot of you
like to know what I use so I love the
new mega star I've been using this
forever if you've been following me for
a while
you've seen this every time I straighten
my hair I think it's just great so
definitely check it out if you're
looking for a new straightener I always
have coupon codes and stuff like that
below if you're interested
and then last step is the outfit it's
just something really casual fun kind of
cute in summary so the top that I have
on is from Lulu's my shorts are from one
teaspoon I love one teaspoon but if you
order them definitely make sure to go
down a couple sizes and my bracelets are
from the stacked collection and my shoes
are different animal so I hope you
