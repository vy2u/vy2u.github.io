little bit bigger which is fine in the
waist but where are my boobs like oh you

don't really know what I'm gonna talk
about I'm just gonna kind of chitchat
and talk to you and get ready I don't

like a dramatic look what have you guys

just upload a vlog in that day I'll be
on that video replying the comments
constantly do you want to see like any
type of challenge videos let me know I
want to do these cooking videos because
Davis's mom bought me a mixer for my
birthday I've talked about this on
snapchat so if you have follow me on
snapchat you know I'm talking about but
she bought me a mixer and I've never
used a mixer before like this like a
really big KitchenAid one beautiful
super excited to use it I was thinking
in my head I was like I have no idea
use this and how fun would it be to go
on Pinterest find a recipe I plan on
doing like a vegan recipe some cookie
some healthier dessert recipes and I was
thinking like how fun would it be if I
tried on camera with like a glass of
wine chilling nothing super proper just
having fun and let you see if they're
too difficult for people like me who
don't really bake often or cook often I
just thought be super fun have a glass
of wine chill you know something like
that so subscribe to my vlog channel
because I have that video coming soon I
bought all the stuff the other day and
I'm just super excited for you to see it
really quickly I'm going to be using
these new Smashbox palettes that Shay
Mitchell came out with with Smashbox
with this packaging it is just
mind-blowing
honestly I'm mesmerized by this
packaging I mean they're just all so
beautiful the only only critique that I
have only thing is like it's hard for me
to open it right here like I'm glad I
have nails but so low that I have to
like dig my nail in there to lift it up
otherwise these are great the
pigmentation is really awesome this is
obviously my favorite palette you can
already tell this one's the ablaze eye
palette so pretty so when we using this
one I'm also going to be using a little
bit of the matte one which this is
called the matte eyeshadow palette my
hand is shaking so bad right now I don't
know why but since shaking for the past
hour a smoky eye palette I think I'm
going to use it for the green in here
because it's just so beautiful then you
want to recreate the look I did the
other day it's raining outside and we
have like tornado warning so you hear
something hopefully my lights don't go
out oh that would suck that happened me
one time I was sitting there talking and
all of a sudden went gone no I was like
okay so I'm first going to take the
matte eyeshadow palette I'm gonna take
the lighter shade put it all over my lid
now anyways behind I had rain and so
long until the other day I don't know
how many of you like has paid attention
or whatever but Gatlinburg was had like
this huge huge fire so incredibly sad um
I really feel for the people of
Gatlinburg because like we needed rain
so bad and everybody was in a drought or
whatever in the south and
luckily rain came through and you know
put it all out but I mean it's just so
sad to see the pictures from the
aftermath of the Gatlinburg fire and
it's just so sad we were actually
planning on going to Gatlinburg which
we're still going that way for a
vacation you guys will know if you
follow my vlog channel and you'll know
really soon because we're gonna vlog and
do like fun videos out there I haven't
talked to Davis about this yet but I was
also thinking like when we go up there
maybe we could do something where we
could help out one day or something I
don't know it's gonna be a couple weeks
before you go up there but I'm sure they
would need help with something some
somebody wants to help but I figured
since already headed that way maybe
there's something we could do so if you
live that way and know if they're doing
anything where you can have like
volunteers let me know in the comments
because I think I would want to do that
one day with Davis we're taking the dogs
up there with us for this vacation which
I'm so excited about and it's just gonna
be a good time yeah anyways doing
getting a lot of rain
thank God we needed this rain so bad so
so bad so it's a blessing and it's just
now it's really coming down
now I'm going to take the sunset palette
which is my favorite palette get out the
trash girls so I'm going to take this
one which is the ablaze palette I'm
gonna take this burnt orange color which
you know is my favorite it's like this
red orange color I'm gonna put this in
the crease so how is everyone's
Thanksgiving I want to know what you
guys are gifting your boyfriend's please
let me know some ideas down below in the
comments um Davis has a list and if you
follow me on snapchat you saw it but
it's so funny it's like oil for the boat
bullets I mean just stuff like that
so um I was like oh wait for someone
else to get you some of that stuff and
of course some of it I'm already gonna
get me know what you guys are getting I
did get him one thing which I don't
really want to say he's not know if he's
gonna wash this or not he probably won't
but I got him one thing from Target the
other day that is just so funny I'm
excited to give it to him I'll probably
let you guys know what it is only blog
channel just as long as he doesn't watch
it I want to know what you guys wanna
see I have my videos kind of planned out
for this week and next week but what do
you want for the rest of December
you've been telling me to try out this
silicone things and that was on
refinery29 s website and I actually
purchased it somebody had twin to me
yesterday morning and I went online and
I got it right away because I was like
you gotta be quick in this youtube world
you got to go ahead get it the most
expensive shipping to get it at your
house in time so that's what I did
should be here in just a few days but I
can't wait to share it with you it's
like some silicone sponge to really
weird so I'm gonna do a video on that
I've seen a lot of people tweeting me
about it and I just figured I would
address it that I did get it and you
guys are gonna see it very very soon so
I had to go outside my house today it
sound so bad sounds like I never leave
which I kind of don't but I do outside
my house today and cut my bushes because
they're getting so big and I was just
like oh my god these things are so
annoying like I don't like the bushes
anyways they're not to type that I light
they're very bland and just not a
favorite of mine kind of just blending
these together sorry guys you're just
looking kind of like blah just like a
brown bush I don't I don't like it and
even though it's not spring when it is
spring there they're not pretty I went
and bought some Bush cutters yesterday
because I wanted to try to put some
lights on my bushes out front and I'm
sitting there trying to cut the bushes
and like the limbs and you guys I just
did like a terrible job there's like
missing pieces in my Bush now because I
got so annoyed sitting there trying to
like trim all the limbs that I just
started cutting everything and now
there's like missing holes in it and it
just looks terrible that's like good
gosh hopefully it works I mean they're
cut down which is nice it's what I like
I could have done a better job have had
it so many people requested me and Davis
to film the boyfriend is my voiceover
tag and that is coming very soon as long
as he wants to do it I was actually
watching them over the weekend and it's
just so funny and I don't know it's just
hilarious and a lot of you been asking
us to do it so I told him about it
he might do it hopefully he does you
guys should try to encourage him in the
comments that he should do it I don't
know if I should try to take an old
video and let him do it off of that or
if I should film something kind of quick
and have him voice over in that so let
me know what you guys think is there
like a specific vide
no you think he should do the voiceover
in I'm just been using all the colors
pretty much from here I just use this
one all over or like in their part of my
lid not doing like that great of a job
honestly I feel like I'm blending all
the colors together but I'm just trying
to hurry I haven't really been doing a
lot of makeup tutorials lately just
because they haven't been first on my
list if you guys want to see some let me
know I've been doing more like reviews
and trying to do fun video so I'm gonna
quickly move on to face I'm not gonna do
eyeliner or anything but I will be
putting on these I'll or Lux gilded
false lashes these are amazing Ulta less
than $15 they're so beautiful
I've talked about them numerous times I
just talked about them in my favorites
video we have some tornado warnings
going on what is that huh we don't get
rain and I don't get in tornadoes what's
going on I'm gonna do my lashes and
stuff whenever I do my brows I'm going
to go ahead and move on to face real
quick and kind of baked everything so
first I'm going to use my Smashbox
primer water you guys know I love this
stuff just amazing it hydrates the skin
but it doesn't like get you all a few
really oily skins then I'm going to be
using today - hasta de Nonna magic
anti-shine a flawless face base really
love this as well mention it in my
favorites video I like to take like
three pumps I know it's a little
excessive but I'm an excessive person
put this on my face I like to start here
in the center where I have the most
problematic areas and then I work my way
out once you start to feel it as primers
getting tacky then you can put your
foundation on and it's a really nice
kind of smoothing primer feels really
good on the skin and just smooths
everything out but keeps it locked in
the whole time I leave my brow
so just Donna starting to get tacky now
you see how my skin is kind of sticking
to my fingers that's how you know it's
ready to go there my name is my fiance
matte finish foundation in the shade oh
five because I have self tan so I can
wear this again so excited I love this
foundation and I'm using a japanesse
Beauty Blender I got this in a set with
a smaller sponge and a cleanser and it
was $18 but if you can find this by
itself less than $18 I think this is a
really great alternative to the Beauty
Blender they like this foundation makes
my skin look just flawless
love it so much again this is a shadow
five it's darker than my actual face but
it matches my self-tanner if you don't
know what's a self-tanner I use I always
have it below in the description box
with like a little coupon it's loving
tans my favorite makes me super dark
look so funny because I don't have any
concealer on I don't like putting
foundation like right underneath my eyes
since I put quite a bit of concealer on
so it always looks like a little funny
till I do it then we're going to move on
to my favorite concealer combo and I've
been using these two together for a
while now and I just love them together
I use the Tarte shape tape concealer
like here in the inner part where I have
a little bit more darkness then I use
this like on the rest of the face this
is really really light on me just a
little bit too light I should probably
use my Maybelline better skin right now
I'm going to use the shade light/medium
from Tarte and I'm just going to use the
Born This Way concealer as well I find
that the Tarte concealer is great for
mainly the inner part of my eye it's a
pretty thick concealer and you don't
have to use too too much even though I
get excessive with it as always if I'm
doing a full coverage look but I like to
normally keep it on my nose and right
here in the inner part of the eye then I
use a lighter concealer for the rest of
my face because I don't really need that
much coverage it's a really nice Beauty
Blender job if you don't know japonesque
is like the drugstore brand or it's I
don't know would you call it a drugstore
man it's like the drugstore brand at
Ulta it's a little expense it kind of
reminds me of Real Techniques I guess
you could say and this sponge is just
awesome awesome awesome awesome I would
definitely check out their stuff too
because they have really great brushes
I've mentioned a few of their brushes
before so I want to know if it's snowed
where you guys live for vacation this
year I really wanted to go somewhere
where it snowed for Christmas or like
just I don't know I just really wanted
to know okay I want to snow and even
though we're going to Tennessee I hope
it snows and you never know now because
as weather is just bananas it's super
warm right now but right now I feel like
it's warm where I am because of the fact
that it's been raining so much and it's
just that weird weather change you know
what it rains and sometimes it gets
humid and gross outside that's where
it's at right now but I think I'm pretty
sure I saw Fort Drum had
shit-ton snow and I was like look
forward to this and I'm like oh I wish I
had that right now even though I know
it's super cold up there and it's gonna
be like a culture shock I just want
freaking snow I think it was on army WTF
Facebook page where they showed a
picture of like guys at Fort Drum in the
snow and then it was up to their knees
and that was like a few weeks ago like a
month ago I was like wow guys that was
quick
Fort Drum did not wait to get some snow
now I'm going to take whatever I have
left of this flower beauty powder you
guys I need another one almost felt it I
need another one of these so bad it's
the best to bake with I'm obsessed with
it I'm just gonna bake underneath my
eyes with the little bit I have left I
don't think I've ever gone through a
full translucent powder before till I
got this now I'm going to do is I'm
going to fill in my brows all I do is I
use my benefit brow product with my
Sephora brow brush I love dual ended
brushes like this and I found it at
Sephora and I love brushes like this
this is the pro brown number 20 and I'm
gonna put my lashes on and then I'll be
right back to finish off the face of you
guys okay so that my lashes on I'll do
my eyeliner here in the inner part after
we finish up the face you guys know I
love my Neutrogena Healthy Skin bronzer
I've been using it constantly I'm gonna
hit paint on this very very soon I just
love it so much but I wanted to use a
new bronzer today I went my bronzer
drawer and I it's not new I've used it
before and I've mentioned it before that
I love it but it's the radiant bronze
light and I just kind of wanted to use
it again because it's been so long I
need to start put my makeup in those
drawers instead of keeping it in here so
that way I start using products I used
to use all the time so I'm just going to
use this to bronze up the skin because I
remembered how beautiful this was
there's a lot more pigmented and I
expect it to be I was originally looking
for Matt gimme Sun but I couldn't find
it I think I threw it away because it
was so old but I found this one I
remember I used to love it but I do not
remember it being this pigmented whole
town don't mind me just go in a little
bananas
my Ecotools brush and start blending
this out don't mind my severely bronzed
face oh man I like you guys like my
scrunchie I got it from Lululemon I was
like it's kind of cute right okay now
I'm going to take the narcissist palette
this is an old palette from them it's
the cheek studio palette and I just want
to use this again I wanted to use this
shade right here so what I'm going to
use I don't even know what color did
nothing too crazy since we got bronzer
absolutely everywhere okay now we're
going to use this from Ulta this is the
winter Glo collection I haven't tried
this before but it's like a highlighter
palette three illuminators two
highlighters three blushes so shows you
have the three highlighters here the two
illuminators here in the three blushes
those blushes are my kind of color is
there anything like the other Ulta brand
blushes and they're gonna be good let's
see oh yeah I kind of color so um oh
whoa that was different
this one is this one right here it came
off super sheer when I first watched it
this one came off like freaking insane
oh yeah this one is this is not
good sorry Ulta oh guy sitting the only
thing that's good this palette is
blushes they're really not that great I
cannot find my highlighter brush so I'm
just going to use this Real Techniques
brush and we're putting them in these to
see if maybe with brush they're better
I don't really like it I like it I like
okay so I'm using this highlighter from
the new NARS unfiltered one palette
these are out for the holidays it's
pretty okay
and then I'm just going to blend a
little bit and I'm gonna line my
waterline with a brown ish eyeliner this
is from Marc Jacob I just put that on my
lower lash line smudge it out a bit and
also underneath my lower lashes and then
we're going to go in with the smoky
palette again to take the green in here
because I love this color I'm going to
smudge this underneath our lower lashes
I'm using a makeup forever lipliner I
love these and these are awesome and
they have so many gorgeous neutral
colors I'm going to use this shade
number 22 I'm going to going with the
lighter gloss which is again almost real
ooh love this color combo so this is
definitely like a really pigmented gloss
when I heard liquid lipstick I was
thinking of of course a matte one but
these are definitely like much more
pigmented glosses but that color combo
is so pretty oh my god that ombre effect
I'm obsessed with it okay guys so I just
curled my short hair don't worry guys
I'm loving my short hair so I don't plan
on really growing my hair back out for a
while I don't know when I plan on
growing it back out just cuz short hair
is so much fun and a little bit easier
to deal with so that is what I did I
just curled it always tossing some hair
to the side you know I'm always like
this yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
