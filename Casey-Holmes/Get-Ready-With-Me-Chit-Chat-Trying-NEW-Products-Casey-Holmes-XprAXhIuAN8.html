kind of like a get ready talk through
tutorial and what I'm gonna do is try
out some new products that I have I've
purchased a couple new things from elf
and Milani and L'Oreal and I got some
new lashes from hawks of lashes and I
would send something by benefit that I
wanted to share with you guys so yeah
that's what we're gonna do today I
figured a talk-through tutorial would be
fun and I have not done one of these in
so long I remember like a couple years
ago I used to do these all of the time
and I just haven't done them so I
figured today would be a great day to do
it and yeah we're just gonna go ahead
and get started okay so it's already
primed in my eyes with what I usually
use if you want to know what it is I'll
leave it down below in the description
box and I'm just going to apply a little
bit of tape I purchased a new palette
from ELF that I'm just so excited about
because I used one Shea from it
obviously these were more neutral shades
but I loved them so these are absolutely
beautiful and I can't wait I dabbled
into this shade right here just because
I wanted a shade for my crease because
what I've been doing a lot lately is
just doing a shade and the crease winged
eyeliner and lashes just really simple
looks lately I've been doing because I
just haven't felt like you know going
out and like doing a smoky eye so I
figured today we would kind of play it
up a little bit so I think these are all
beautiful though in that shade was
amazing so I can't wait to see how the
rest of them are so I'm gonna go in with
this shade right here and I'm just going
to put this as my transition shade and
put it into the crease I like to go all
the way into the inner corner and I like
using this brush right here because it's
not like too precise but it doesn't get
it all over the crease that's also what
I've been kind of doing lately is just
really focus focusing a color like this
right into the crease and if you guys
are wondering these bracelets are from
stacked collection I absolutely love
them she sent me some actually that are
offering lines which I thought would be
great because I saw where she had like
some bracelets for other football teams
and I was like uh do you have a burn she
was like yeah so I'm going to if you
offer games this year with
dad probably and I'm so gonna bust them
out I'm so excited
even if I don't go to a game I'm gonna
bust him out on game day I'm just so
excited go to some football games and me
and my dad haven't gone together in like
years so that's gonna be good but
anyways so that's where that's from and
my hair I actually have my foxy loves
extensions in and I cut them to the
links that I have now which I love the
links of my hair eyes right now because
it's not too long and not too short my
hair was super long and then when I went
and got it dyed darker I cut off a few
inches and now I just like oh that's
what the length it is I just I love it I
realized there is a too long look for me
and it was there for a while I do love
super long hair but I'm loving the
length it is right now so yeah if you
want to check them out I'll leave them
down below but I just I love them I
think they're amazing okay so moving on
what kind of look do I want to do like I
don't even know gonna take a pencil
brush
this one's from Mac and Rose to Don it
so thanks rose I'm going to take this
shade right here which is kind of like a
plummy color can I have to use this
manual focus no take it's kind of plummy
color or right here and I'm just going
to follow my outer V and a little bit
into the crease just to kind of deepen
it up a little bit I'm doing a Q&amp;amp;A
really really soon cuz I really I really
love q and A's and I find them to be so
much fun and I just don't know I love
what you guys get to know me more and
I'm such a like open person that I share
a lot with you guys probably more than I
should especially on my blog channel I
share a lot with you guys just because I
feel like y'all are my friends and it's
not like we're sitting here judging each
other I mean some of you are but most of
you aren't so I'm like so excited
because I'm gonna film it after this and
post it like a little bit later because
I did just post a Q&amp;amp;A but I really want
to post another one just because I love
asking questions I just find them so fun
I was telling this guy that I'm talking
to today I I was faced out of him or
whatever and he asked me like if I had
one best friend and it made me think and
I'm like oh my god I don't have like
just one best friend that I've had since
I was like a kid I only have best
friends which is there's nothing wrong
with this but only have best friends
that I just became best friends with
within the last like seven or eight
months and I think that's so crazy like
isn't it crazy how like I don't know
people just change and you change and
you evolve and like you don't have one
best friend just like as life goes on
you find people that are more loyal than
others it's so crazy to me oh no I'm
gonna take this chair right here and I'm
gonna blend that out a little bit and I
wouldn't say this palette is pretty
freakin awesome it is nice than matte
and it's so pigmented I mean I mean he
didn't actually tell and I feel like
they blend out really really well so I
heart them
I think elf did an amazing amazing job
with these and I'm really pumped about
them I'm also pumped about some other
stuff I'm going to show you guys today
but this is like one of the main things
I'm just like really happy with a shout
out to elf for killing it they're
killing the game right now
so anyways I was telling the guy I was
talking to you like how much I like keep
my heart on my sleeve which is kind of
obvious if you if I start talking to
someone like dating them it's really
obvious that I keep my heart on my
sleeve cuz I just kind of put it all out
there for the most part but he was like
well I'll try not to let you down oh my
god slowly okay now I'm gonna take this
one right here and we're gonna put this
all over the lid I'm using this matte
brush this is the Mac 239 and I really
like this brush I really like my Mac
brushes in general I think there are
great brushes I know some people kind of
dog them and you know there are
definitely cheaper alternatives like I
feel like for the Mac 217 you could go
and get this morphe 513 which I'm
obsessed with you could just get this
brush and be fine but brushes like this
I think are really great and the pencil
brush by Mac is something that I hi
recommend checking out okay anyway that
was so rude
camera my camera likes to shut off
randomly and it like gives me a heart
attack I think I was saying I really
like this brush and the pencil brush
from Mac these are like the two main
brushes I highly recommend from them
just cuz I think they're amazing
especially this one for all over the lid
so I'm gonna take that show you like I
told you right here and I'm gonna put
this all over the lid we're just gonna
kind of make this like more of a
lightish smokey eye well know we'll see
how it turns out oh my gosh have you
guys heard Luke Bryan's new song strip
it down still obsessed with it when I
first heard kick the dust up I was like
really disappointed I still don't like
the song I mean I everybody keeps saying
I need to keep listening to it and I
love it which I'm sure I will but I feel
like I've heard it like thirty times and
I just can't I can't love it it's just
not my favorite from him and once I
heard strip it down I was like yes this
is the Luke Bryan I know and love and
the song is so insanely beautiful you
have to check it out like I'm so in love
with it I would listen to it now but
copyright would catch me in like a hot
minute
okay I'm going back in with this shade
right here and watch it blend out that
in the crease I was watching what I've
been watching I feel like I've been
watching like a lot of New York
housewives lately and I want to go back
to New York
so bad like I just like want to live
there or something not actually live
there but I just love that show so much
and they make me want to live there even
though I know life wouldn't be like how
they have it it just seems like such a
fun environment like can I be a part of
the Housewives and just you know be a
part of the cast and like be Bethany's
best friend because me and Bethany we
get along so well the same very open
open nest not openness how would you say
it I would say we have the same smart
mouth and the same approach to things
that's
that's how I would say it I love her
Bethany is my favorite who's next
I don't know who I'd like after Bethenny
Ramona's like somebody I'm on and off
with like I can't decide if I like her
that much or not but I think she's great
for TV I think she's great TV okay so
I'm just going to blend this out a
little bit more but I really like how
can I just look at this lips I think it
looks really nice I'm gonna take it's
more feet in five thirteen and we're
just gonna blend out the edges a little
bit more she's just a clean brush I
really like these morphe brushes I
really highly recommend them if you
don't want to splurge keep in mind
brushes are gonna be more expensive and
sets then they will be individually but
you're gonna pay more if you pay
individual and you try to make your own
set you know what I'm saying
so I really recommend this brand I think
more fees a great brand and I'm not just
saying that to say that I'm really
really feel like it's a great brand so I
would definitely check them out if
you're looking for something more
affordable especially if you're just
getting like starter brushes like this
one I love the 513 and they also of the
441 and I love this one for a nose
contour which kind of fluffed out
because I was brushed or I was cleaning
it but it's the 514 I love this one as
well these ones are like some of my
favorites and now okay so what benefit
sent me was this huge box which I'm
gonna try to take everything off filling
it in the red so they sent this like
really huge box I was not expecting it
this looks whatever I saw other people
get it but I didn't think I was gonna
get it and yeah it's the killer colours
stuff they're not paying me to show you
guys this but I'm using some of the
products today so hey look like they're
real makeup remover and the they're real
mascara which I've tried they're they're
real mascara
I tried this like a long time ago I
didn't like it so I'm gonna try it again
and see how I like them because they
gave it they gave one in black blue and
brown and then they also
since the push-up liner switch today I'm
gonna try the black push-up liner
because I've never tried it before and
I've always wanted to test it out and
see how it is so this is the they're
real benefit push-up liner
I've heard so many mixed reviews and
some of them when it first came out were
obviously sponsored by foot benefit and
then I was watching um clever clever TV
or something as like Lilliana Megan
Megan ranks and I forget the other two
girls names
Lily was wearing this I should probably
read the directions
Lily was wearing one of these liners in
her video and it wasn't like sponsored
by venison or anything and she had her
face in water and her eyeliner was not
moving as she said in the comments that
she was wearing this so I was like I
need to try that this green looks
absolutely stunning okay so take the
applicator off and it's just weird it's
like this bendy felt type thing and you
just really don't need directions
but you just twist it up until you get
some product on it I'm actually really
nervous because I've heard such mixed
reviews on this and I've been just I
didn't want to buy on my own money to be
quite honest with you because I heard
such mixed reviews but when you did send
it to me so I figured I would try it on
camera for the first time oh it's thick
it's like it's like a clay type of thing
okay let's see I'm really nervous I'm
not gonna lie I'm really nervous you say
you don't need to do a lot to it though
okay so I'm just gonna line my eyes
what's going on really smooth it's just
a little awkward oh hello it's just a
little awkward because I haven't used
like a liner like this in so long I'm
gonna wing it out though I'm gonna have
to definitely clean that up
but this stuff is very very black very
black sometimes it's like clumping a
little bit I don't know if you can see
that clumping just a little bit I don't
know I'm not getting like a clean sharp
line like I usually like I think with
any liner it's just practice and
practice practice but this is a very
very black liner and it doesn't apply
terribly it's just something to get used
to but it's not like not a bad liner let
me see if I can clean it up really
easily so lid to this thing and I like
the lid I like the packaging of this I
think it's really cute cuz you just
twist on oh also I don't have a music
this is how you me along i Cydia I've
been using these be gone next to the
rivers and I love them I use them for a
lip swatch video which I have to refill
but I use it for a lip swatch video and
they're amazing I mean it's a little bit
thicker than I like but it's not bad so
I'm gonna do this I real quick and I'm
gonna come back and we're gonna do
lashes okay so I did do it on this eye
too
and I notice with this eye liner it's
kind of one of those liners where I do a
thin line and then it gets bigger and
bigger and bigger I do like how black it
is I noticed on a lot of people's videos
when it first came out it was clumping a
lot I don't know if they changed the
formula but I didn't really have that
much of a problem with clumping I
thought about Lily wearing this to talk
about how long wearing it is I think
that's why they included the makeup
remover just because I bet it's like
seriously hard to take off but now I'm
actually gonna apply these House of
lashes falsies these are new ones they
actually sent them to me in the mail as
well as you said this cute button since
lash games strong so cute is that I
don't know what I'm gonna do with it but
I'm not getting rid of it so they said
these these are new lashes and boudoir
and I think they're beautiful they're
fuller in the middle and more wispy on
the outside so I'm going to apply these
and
I'll be right back okay separate the
lashes on and I really like these
boudoir lashes I think they're beautiful
they might be my new favorite it's like
I love them so much and I did probably
my face with my usual primers by the way
the glue is drying for the lash glue so
that's why there's some that you can see
through I use my regular primers I use
the primer at water from Smashbox and
then the pore minimizer from Smashbox as
well and now I'm just going to do my
same concealer routine and foundation
routine which is Estee Lauder Double
Wear which I love I still adore the Born
This Way from Too Faced I heard of them
until in love with us you guys know that
I love this this is probably like my
fourth or fifth bottle I'm not even
joking like within a couple years I
start using this like a couple years ago
I don't know so I'm going to use this I
got the pump from Mac and then I'm using
a Mac Pro Longwear concealer and then
the nor since concealer as well if
something's not broke you won't have to
fix it so I'm just using my good old
trusty dandy foundation concealers just
cuz I love them now before I spent my
concealer and everything else I'm going
to use a highlighter really like these
two highlighters I've used them before I
like to mix them together because
sometimes this one can be a little too
warm this one can be a little too a
pearly pink so these are the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi a liquid goal or liquid
illuminizer so we have w 101 and C a 301
and again like I said I just like to mix
them I'm back in my hand that's
seemingly warm golden one and then this
one's the more pearl one I don't
necessarily I don't like pink Kyler's
just because I have a lot of red in my
skin and I tend to stay away from those
highlighters but mixed together with
this one I think it gives a really nice
shade though I'll just I know it's a lot
you can use less but honestly things
like what highlighters gonna last me
forever anyways I'm just going to Pat
this on the tops of my cheekbones then
it just goes a really nice glow I
remember seeing reviews on this when I
first came out and I was like yes and
one thing I like to do too sometimes I
just take my foundation brush and blend
it out and then you just gives a nice
glow to the skin nothing too crazy what
I like and I also use it on my elders
and stuff like that
going out and then going in I got these
new pilots from ELF there's a bronzer
and a contour palette I'm going to take
the contour palette and this yellow
shade right here and I'm going to set my
under eye concealer and like or anywhere
I said or anywhere I have concealer I'm
just gonna set so like here it takes all
the shine away which I like cause shiny
this just draws attention to my pores
and we don't want that and this brush is
shedding like a mofo okay moving on to
the bronzer palette I'm going to take
this shade right here it was just in the
bottom right hand corner and this is
what it looks like it has like a little
bit shimmer in it which I don't mind for
bronzer I'm gonna take my big brush tap
it in there the reason why I took it out
is because I don't want love how there's
a dog here in this I don't want the
other shades to blend into it so then
I'm just going to bronze up the skin and
again I don't mind a little bit of
shimmer just because it gives like a
glow oh my face it's just gonna catch it
so it really sucks okay so that's it for
bronzer pop that Wow
now I'm going to take in the contour
palette and I'm going to use this shade
right here which is more not warm it's
my Uncle Tom side and I'm gonna take my
NARS brush I like this contour shade a
lot because like I said it is more on
the cool side is really easy to blend
out so I like it a lot okay for blush
I'm going to use something different I
purchased one from Milani that I have
not seen I mean it's probably been out
but I and C Awakening rose powder blush
just looks like my kind of color isn't
it good playing this to cheeks really
subtle I like it's like a subtle hint of
pink like a little blush color okay and
then one of my new favorite products is
this highlighter from Becca which Jaclyn
hill created an anesthesia shame pain
pop which is it's stunning I'm gonna
take this and apply to it was a lot
I - right so it tops of my cheekbones
I hear what's not getting caught in it
that'd be great
I mean how pretty is that huh
I love this watch okay hi there come on
it's really stunning okay and then next
thing I'm gonna do is fill in my brows
I'm just gonna do the same old thing
this is like an all over the place video
I'm just gonna use the same product I've
been using and it's the anasazi ax dip
brow it is in soft brown so I'm gonna
fill in my brows and I'll be right back
okay moving on we're gonna finish up
this look I need to I'm gonna take this
next race yogini pencil gel pencil liner
and this is in the brown shade just
because I don't want to do a black I
don't want to be like super harsh so I
haven't actually been doing a lot of
black on my waterline I've been doing
more browns so and I really like these
liners from NYX I hate what anyway upper
and lower waterlines I just have to be
Doug but I go back in I don't with the
elf palettes and we're going to take the
darkest shade in here which is like a
knot it's like a carbon black it's not
like super super intense black we're
just gonna push this up against our
lower lash line and then I also kind of
fling it out towards that liner it's
okay if this is messy because we're
going to go in and blend it out then
going in with our pencil brush we're
gonna take that same shade the first
shade we used in the beginning eyelashes
are like right now we're gonna blend
this out I never get like super close up
when I'm doing my lower lash line cuz I
like this mirror in my face I'm going to
put on this lower lash mascara that I'm
obsessed with from NYX just my scare
Phoenix is so good for your lower lash
line it's the NYX skinny mascara and I'm
just so obsessed with em and it's really
really thin but it's so perfect for your
lower lash line like or your lower
lashes I love it so much more than
Clinique bottle brush mascara and I use
that for ever and this is so much better
it just got it grabs all the little
lashes it makes them look nice and full
okay now that we've got that on I'm
going to go in and just touch up a few
shades so the first one I'm going to
take this shade again and this palette
right here this kind of like reddish
tone which is what we used in the crease
to blend out just a little more that in
Blinn just a little more here in the
crease kind of extend it out a little
bit so simple simple simple just going
in adding a little bit more color and
then I'm going to add a highlight I like
to move like flat share your brushes
like this for a highlight just because
they really get right underneath the
brow I'm just going to take the one in
here just the matte cream shade and put
that underneath my brow and then for lip
I guess I'll use like none of my lip
liners are sharpened to be quite honest
with you that's why don't use like half
of them so lazy I'll use this holla'd
collegio herbal lip liner this isn't the
shade naked that's the name I never say
it right I know people like hate me for
it this is a good just like nude liner
and I like that it's retractable you can
always a win my heart with a retractable
liner so I'm going to use a NYX stable
lipstick which is just a nice nude so we
use this fern it's a lighter kind of
peachy nude
you really blend out that liner just
kidding we're not using this okay we're
gonna go in with it everyone I think I
want to go in with world Mac to be quiet
on this video the lipstick if you didn't
know they can go with a lipstick and
we're all by Mac and I really like it
so and then I'm gonna top it off with
this Urban Decay gloss in liar I've been
loving a liar and kinky if so much
anything there's such beautiful shades
so I'm just gonna plant it on top
because I don't smell like super dry I
do love them that lip but I also love
with these classes so that is it before
this makeup look I just wanted to share
some new products with you guys and like
show them in action and I've been using
some of these for a little while and
