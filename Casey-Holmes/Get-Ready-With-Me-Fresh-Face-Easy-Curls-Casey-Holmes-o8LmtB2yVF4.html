a get ready with me and I'm going to
show you guys my go-to fresh face look
and then also my hair I've had a ton of
question about this makeup look I know
it's really simple and things like that
but you guys really wanted to see it I
asked you on Instagram post if you did
and a lot of you said yes so I wanted to
recreate this for you guys this is
something that I do if I'm going on a
plane and I actually want to wear makeup
which is pretty rare but sometimes it
happens been doing it since I've been
sick because I've been sick for almost
in methanal I actually still can't here
so this is why I do it a mistake and I
still want to be put together or if I
just feel like putting on some makeup
and I just don't want to do a full-on
smoky eye this is what I go to I love it
I think it's fresh there's a lot of
highlighting in it and that's what I
think I really love about it I found a
new highlighter that I really love and
yeah I just I love this lighter look so
one of my favorites lately and this
hairstyle I love it because adds just
enough volume for me but it's so easy to
do yeah I'm gonna quit talking I hope
you guys enjoyed this video again sorry
about yelling at you I can't really hear
myself right now thank you guys so much
for watching and let's get started with
the video okay so I had just gotten done
blow-drying my hair and I needed to put
on some music because obviously I'm
obsessed with music and the first thing
I'm going to do is these i jealous these
are my skin and you can get them at Ulta
they come in a pack of eight but I love
these so much I showed them in a haul
not too long ago I believe I'm pretty
sure I did I love these on days that I
feel like I just need a bit of a
refresher and these feel so good and
cooling underneath the eyes so while
you're waiting for these to kind of soak
in and do their thing you can do
whatever you can lay on the couch do
what I do listen to music think your
Drake you know whatever makes you happy
in life but after it's finally all done
it's been about ten minutes you can go
ahead and take them off so I've been
using that first day Beauty the
mattifying lotion a lot lately and I
love it for my skin and I'm taking this
Tarte under eye brightener and putting
that on
and then I'm going to go ahead and apply
my primers I apply this Smashbox primer
excessively today because I just felt
like I needed it so you don't need this
many sprays at all you need like two or
three you don't need twenty and then I
was trying to dry it notice my self
tanner and then I notice my muscles and
I was kind of proud of myself so I was
like get it girl I'm going to apply my
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation and
put this all over my face I'm just using
the makeup geek foundation brush which I
have been loving with this foundation
lately as I was applying concealer the
camera actually shut off it was a
filming so I just apply to underneath my
eyes in the center of my face taking the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer putting
that in the center of my nose and
blending it out just to highlight that
area going in with this Marc Jacobs
palette I'm going to take the yellow
shade in the palette which you can tell
I love because I have hit pan on this
bad boy it's just a really good powder
and I'm going to put this underneath my
eyes just to set everything in place
then I'm taking this Bobbi Brown bronzer
in golden light with this brush from
bare minerals that I have been loving
lately so much I love it for bronzer and
powder pretty much everything but I'm
going to go ahead and just bronze up my
skin this doesn't do anything too
drastic but it just warms it up a little
bit and I put it on the tops of my
forehead my cheeks and also below my
chin and down my neck and like I said
just warms it up I'm not contouring
today I'm just really focused on warming
up the skin highlighting you know not
doing anything too crazy then I'm taking
this Urban Decay blush in video which is
a beautiful flush color I absolutely
love the way that this looks and again
I'm taking this bareMinerals black brush
not Brad blush C brush blush ooh Lord
taking the brush from bareMinerals and
applying it and I love it because it
fits right on the apples of the cheeks
and then I'm using my benefit Watts up
highlighter and I love this highlighter
it is a beautiful beautiful highlighter
and I'm just going to take this morphe
brush and apply this to the tops of my
cheekbones up towards the brow the
center of the nose on my Cupid's bow and
then also on my chin the glow that this
gives you is just amazing it is so
beautiful
I love it so much and even though that
this is a cream product I don't have to
set it with powder and I have very oily
skin so I love that I love that I don't
have to set with powder it just looks so
good throughout the day and it lasts all
day long and looks amazing in pictures
highly recommend this highlighter you
guys it's my new obsession I am in love
with it then I'm going to fill in my
brows of my Anasazi a dip brow in soft
brown and I recently just started using
my newest one I had a backup and my
other one was completely dried out and I
remember why I fell in love with this
product I don't like it when it's super
dried out but I do like it you know
right when you first open it I think
it's awesome then I'm taking the
Anastacio brow gel in brunette and just
putting this on my brows this just sets
them in place and the color warms them
up a little bit taking this NARS
eyeshadow primer this is great if you
have oily eyelids and have a hard time
with your eyeshadows staying on this
will make it last all day long I highly
recommend it
and then going back in with the bronzer
and a eyeshadow brush I'm just going to
blend this into the crease and I like
taking the bronzers into the crease I
just feel like it looks so good when it
matches the bronzer on your face to your
eyes it just gives a really warm
natural-looking crease you know and then
I'm taking this Becca cosmetics opal
highlighter and I'm applying this all
over the lid underneath my brows as well
and this is going to brighten everything
up again telling you all about
highlighters in this video I just love
it
and I'm going in with that same brush we
use with a bronzer and just blending out
the edges not doing anything too crazy
taking this NARS eyeliner I just tight
line my upper lashes and then applying
my favorite mascara for the moment I am
using the benefit roller lash and I've
been using this a lot lately and I just
really love the effect that it gives my
lash if I want to do anything more I
will usually just add individual lashes
but that's if I'm feeling froggy then
applying that back a highlighter in my
inner tear duct area effortless we're
using the Jordana tawny lip liner and
then using the Too Faced melted lipstick
in melted Chihuahua which is beautiful
and then that is the complete look I
absolutely love love love it out just
kidding we're taking bite Beauty lip
gloss and cocoa and putting that on top
and it just adds a pretty gloss and I
love bite beauty's lip glosses they feel
really good they're not sticky and they
taste really good as well now this is
the complete look and it's just so glowy
and fresh I think it's perfect for
everyday moving on to the hair like I
said my hair was nice and blow-dried so
all I'm doing is taking my nume curling
iron and I'm wrapping around the ends of
my hair on the barrel I'm using the
largest barrel and yeah I'm just
wrapping it around the ends I'm not
doing anything crazy I'm taking random
sections there's just a little bit
bigger and doing this to my whole head I
do have coupon codes for these new me
wands I always do because they're all
that I use and they're all that I've
used for about three years now so if you
want to check them out I will leave them
in the description box below but after
you've curled all the ends of your hair
you just want to shake it out and then
I'm gonna take this Kendra what's it
cold
I forgot I think it's a dry finishing
spray and I'm just gonna put this all
throughout the hair oh it's a dry
thickening spray I believe but this just
adds a little bit more texture and makes
your hair look a little bit thicker and
fuller which I love and then that is it
you guys I hope you enjoyed this video
