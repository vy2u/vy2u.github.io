be a get ready with me I do want to do a
quick intro because I just have some
stuff I wanna tell you guys first off
most of this stuff in this video is from
Sedona lace I did use my new student
laced vortex brush it brushes brushes
which I purchased this past week or this
last week so if you're interested in
seeing the haul I will link it right
here for you guys
but I did purchase these with my own
money and like I said in the hall they
were 69.95 and I really love them if you
want a detailed video on these brushes
just like this video and I will be more
than happy to do it for you guys I know
there's a lot of reviews out there but I
seriously am in love with these and I
use almost all of these brushes today in
this video so I will have like little
captions telling me which breasts I
breasts which brush I used for this look
or for each little part of my eyeshadow
and face and all that stuff so that will
be in a little caption somewhere in the
video more than likely it will be down
there another thing I use is this Sedona
lace 120 palette now Sedona lace is kind
enough to send this to me for review and
of course these are my honest opinion
this is actually the palette I have been
using for the past week now because I
got it at the end the last week so I
just started using it more this week you
know for work and stuff because there's
so many colors to choose from and I
don't have to go reaching into my
eyeshadow drawer to kind of look and and
find things that go with each other um
so this is about I think 28 dollars and
some change and that's not including
shipping or anything like that so the
top pallet looks like this I won't be
doing the look from this top part but
this is one of the palettes that you get
and I really like that in the packaging
they had each individual palette it was
individually wrapped and they were nice
and boat like the whole palette itself
was bubble wrapped and then it had like
those little like bubble foam things in
it I don't know what you call those
things but um anyway and this is a
palette that I did my look with today
and this is just what looks like kind of
more the door
your colors and then some highlight
colors over here I think some of em are
getting a little washed out but yeah so
this is the one that I worked from I do
really love this palette I think it's
really great some of those shadows
aren't s payment aid I think all of the
shimmer ones are shimmery metallic
colors are very pigmented some of the
matte ones you know the really light
shades they could kind of I don't know
they don't really come off as pigmented
but the really shimmery ones come off
very very well more of the darker colors
they swatch very well a lot of the
lighter shades do you know have really
good pigmentation it's just you know you
have to find which one works best you
know this is a $28 palette and you're
getting 120 shadows you can't expect
every single shot up in this palette to
be absolutely perfect I hope you guys
enjoy this video I absolutely love this
palette if you're interested in
purchasing this I will link it down
below I'm not getting paid to show you
guys this palette or tell you to go look
at it and buy one if you're interested I
was just sent this to try out and tell
you guys how I liked it so this is it
gonna be the video and I hope you all
enjoyed this get ready with me of course
these are my favorite I think I'm gonna
just start doing things like once a
month so yeah I hope you guys enjoy and
I will see you all in my next video bye
