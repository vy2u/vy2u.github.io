getting ready and I was getting ready
for a Christmas dinner with my family so
we are going to just go ahead and get
started
I have already primed my face with my
two regular primers I will leave their
names down below in the description box
and I have primed my eyes with my NARS
eye primer as well and today I'll be
taking the Smashbox masterclass two
palette I absolutely love this palette
and I wanted to use it again so that is
what we'll be using today and we're
going to go in with this first color
which is wheat with the Sigma e-40 and
we're just going to blend this all over
the crease this is going to be our
transition shade so I'm just kind of
buffing it all over not being precise
with it next I'll be taking this
champagne the color and this Sigma e55
and applying this all over the lid I
want to make this look pretty dramatic
I'm going to have kind of bold eyes like
a bold liner in a bold lip but for the
lid I want to keep it really nice and
light just so the eyeliner and stuff
pops and we'll be doing a deeper crease
as well so now we're going to go in with
mocha which is one of my favorite colors
from this palette and I'm going to work
my way from the outer corner going into
the crease I am taking this into my
crease but I'm also putting it a little
bit above as well so this is just going
to make our crease look a little bit
more dramatic since we are taking it up
above our natural crease that we have
and I just like it I think it makes my
eyes look bigger and I really love the
way that it turned out and I'm also
going to make sure that I fluff that
color out in the outer half just so it
doesn't look choppy and then it fades
into the champagne color
so I'm just doing this to both sides and
I'm kind of gradually building the color
up and also blending out as I go I do
clean up my shadow on the outer corners
of my eyes so I'm not worried about that
I'm just worried about making sure
everything is blended and it looks
seamless
we're going in with this concealer and
like I said I'm going to clean up the
edges of my eyeshadow I'm going to go
back in with my Sigma e-40 and just
blend out this line I don't want to
blend it out too much I just want to
make sure it's not SuperDuper harsh
now I'm going in with my estee lauder
double wear foundation and three w1 tani
with my beauty blender and I will leave
a review that I have on this foundation
in the description box I absolutely love
it and I'm taking my mac pro longwear
concealer 's and applying this
underneath my eyes and also blending it
out with my Beauty Blender as well I did
try the Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation shade that was above the
color that I'm using and it was so off
so I had to go back to this color but
you'll see at the end of the video it
really works well
so after patting that all in I'm going
to set it with my Mac prep and prime
translucent powder with my f-86 brush
from Sigma which is my favorite and then
taking my NARS powder in mountain I'm
going to set all of my face makeup
now we're taking the two-faced bronzer
and chocolate Soleil and my NARS brush
and I'm just going to contour my face
I'm doing the same thing just contouring
underneath my cheekbones under my jaw
under my lip on my nose and on my
forehead contouring the whole face as we
are doing such a dramatic look I do want
to make sure I have a nice contour face
and honestly contouring with my favorite
things I feel like I could do this all
day long
I just love contouring and blush and
highlighting it's just one of my
favorite things going on with this blush
from NARS this is in love joy and my
Sigma brush I'm going to apply this to
my cheeks and if you're wondering every
product that I mentioned and show in
this video will be listed in the
description box below per usual so after
I apply that to my cheeks I just want to
blend out with a duo fiber
now going in with the shimmer
highlighter in the palette I'm going to
highlight my cheekbones I absolutely
adore this highlighter it is so
beautiful has to be one of my new
favorites I love it I did fill in my
brows so I'll list everything in the
bottom bar below and now I'm going in
with the color vanilla and I'm just
highlighting underneath my brows and
then I'm going to line my eyes I'm using
the linear intense in the Kat Von D
eyeliner and I am doing more of a
dramatic liner so I am going a little
bit thicker on the lid and with the wing
as well and I just really love a thick
liner with a light lid I just feel like
it really really pops
now we're going to line our upper and
lower waterline with this NARS eyeliner
in Via Veneto now time to curl the
lashes and apply mascara and your
falsies I had to use my wife's L one
because I don't have a drugstore one on
me that is good and I got these lashes
from a website I forget what they're
called but I'll leave the link down
below they're like three bucks apiece
going back in with that mocha shade I'm
going to take my pencil brush from Sigma
and I'm going to buff this underneath my
lower lash line just to kind of smoke it
out a bit more I know my right eyeliner
looks crazy but because I messed up my
lashes but we'll fix it in a minute I
was like I'll just keep going because
they understand mistakes happen so I'm
going to fix my liner right here and
then we're going to put mascara on our
bottom lashes and then I will apply the
other false lashes to the other eye
again I absolutely love these false
lashes they're so wispy but yet they
look so natural you've got to check them
out they're so affordable as well so
this is the eyes complete you can see
they're very neutral but I really love
it especially with the lip we're going
to do I'm taking this Maybelline
lipliner in red and I'm just going to
line my lips with this
then we're taking a true red lipstick
which I'm using the RiRi whoo lipstick
from Mac and this is so so red even
though I do love it I kind of wanted to
deepen it up a little bit make it more
dramatic so I am going to do like an
ombre effect with this I'm taking that
talk that talk lip liner from the
Rihanna collection that came out but you
can use night moth or whatever darker
lip liner you have and I'm going to put
this on the outer corners of my mouth
and then we'll go in with the lipstick
and put that on top and that'll also
help make it look nice and blended as
well and then that is the makeup done I
loved it it's so pretty and just a
classic look I feel like now I for my
hair I did do alternating curls which
I've shown in the past few videos that
I've done so if you want to check those
out I leave them below and then after I
was done curling I did need to put some
dry shampoo in my hair so of course I'm
going to use my batiste dry shampoo just
to make sure my hair doesn't look oily
at all and then after that this is what
my hair and makeup looked like I hope
you guys enjoy it now I did put on some
perfume which is my favorite this is the
Miss Dior from Dior and now onto the
outfit I did want to go casual because
it was later at night and I was kind of
tired that day so these leggings are
from boohoo calm my scarf is from H&amp;amp;M my
top is from Nordstrom and my shoes are
Tory Burch from Nordstrom as well and my
purse is Michael Kors so I hope you guys
