show you guys this look is really simple
and I was just getting ready so I
figured why not film it so really
quickly I want to show you guys this set
before I get started with the get ready
with me you guys are gonna see these in
action in the video and I'll let you
know what I think of each product as I
go along so this is a set that Tarte
will be selling on QVC for about $59 in
69 cents a regular price these products
is two hundred and eleven dollars so
that's a really great deal that you're
getting
so the first thing I'm doing is priming
my eyes with my Paint Pot from Mac and
soft ochre per usual and then I'm going
in with this makeup geek eyeshadow in
creme brulee these are new shadows I've
purchased and I've heard so many good
things so I wanted to try them out and I
am just taking my Mac brush I can't
remember is the Mac 224 brush and just
blending this all over my crease and
just getting it pretty much everywhere
okay so now what I'm doing is going in
with this green pigment from Matt
compact it is called humid and it's a
really gorgeous green shade and I'm just
applying this all over at my lid and
then I'm going in with these makeup geek
eyeshadows in creme brulee and frappe I
believe and I'm just blending this into
my crease and I'm also going to blend a
little bit on my lid just to help blend
out that line that we had from human
just so that it looks nice and seamless
and then we are going in with this
expresso eyeshadow from Mac I believe
it's expresso and I'm just gonna put
this in the outer half of my eye I don't
want to bring it in too far I just want
to put on the outer half and then I'm
going to blend it all in with my
blending brush to again make it look
more seamless and then I'm going in with
this wet wow palette it's the vanity
palette and I'm using this gorgeous
highlight shade to highlight underneath
my brows and then I will be using my
Tarte BB cream today I love this this is
so gorgeous I didn't want to wear a
foundation because I am a little lighter
and I didn't have anything to match but
this is perfect it covers just like a
full coverage foundation and it's really
really lightweight so I adore it and now
I'm using this Tarte BB concealer and
I'm just gonna put this on my nose
because my nose doesn't tend to hold
product very well so I like to put extra
concealer on it and then since that
Tarte concealer is a little too dark for
underneath my eyes I'm going to use this
Jane Cosmetics concealer it's in light
and I'm just going to put this
underneath my eyes and blend it out with
my Beauty Blender and then we're gonna
go ahead and set it with this makeup
forever super matte loose powder you
guys know I love this powder too
death is so good and then to set my face
makeup I'm going to press this NARS
powder in mountain into my skin since
this is a BB cream I want to make sure I
press the powder into my skin instead of
just rubbing it all over so it doesn't
move the product all over my skin and
now I'm taking this Tarte inner rim
liner this is specifically for your
waterline I love this to tight line you
guys it is so good and it lasts all day
and it does last all day on my waterline
as well without smudging and then I'm
taking those to makeup geek eyeshadows
and putting them on my lower lashes and
now it is time to fill in the brows so
I'm just filling them in with my
Anastasia brow Wiz in brunette and I'm
just doing it lightly I just want to
make sure you know I shape my brows out
because I cannot go without doing my
brows now I just can't time for lashes
I'm taking my Tarte eyelash curler and
this lights camera flashes mascara from
Tarte it's really really great I love it
it holds a curl really well and it makes
my lashes really nice and volumize and
then you know my favorite part its
bronzer i'm using this NYC bronzer i
love it you guys this is like four bucks
i mean you really can't go wrong so i'm
just bronzing my skin up with this per
usual just you know on the cheeks on the
top of the forehead my chin everything
like that i'm just doing the regular
bronzing routine and then i'm going in
with this blush for a mac it's called
alpine bronze and i'm just going to put
this a course on my cheekbones and it
adds a really nice bronzed glow to the
skin and then i'm taking that same tart
liner and just lining my waterline to
kind of smoke out this look and make it
look a little bit darker and of course
putting mascara on my bottom lashes and
then i'm going in with this Tarte lip
surgeon i believe and this is great i
actually like to use this as my base for
my lipsticks because it kind of acts as
a lip liner and it makes your lipstick
last so long and I actually like this
color on its own but since this look was
so dark with the eyes I kind
to lighten it up so I just used max
cream the nude over top which I love and
then my NYX butter gloss in at creme
brulee just to make my lips look nice
and shiny and plump so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thumbs up if you did
and thank you so much for watching I'll
see you guys in my next video bye
every second every moment I'm fighting
health super through this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
