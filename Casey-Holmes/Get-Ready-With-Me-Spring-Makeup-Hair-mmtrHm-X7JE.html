ready with me I'm going to show you a
spring hair and makeup look so of course
the first thing I'm going to do is take
my Beauty Blender and apply my favourite
foundation which is makeup forever
matte velvet plus this is in number 40
and I'm just going to blend this out all
over my face this is still my favorite
high-end foundation at the moment then
going in with a Mac prep and prime
highlight this is in light boost I'm
going to just put this all underneath my
eyes on my Cupid's bow my chin my
forehead and I'm just going to blend it
out my finger just to kind of spread the
product out and then I'm gonna go in
with one of my favorite brushes from
Sigma and I will put the name of it down
below let's see if I could find it the
name of it is the Sigma tapered kabuki
f-86 so I'm just gonna blend it out with
this brush then i'm taking the mac pro
longwear concealer in NC 20 and I'm
really not meaning to flick you off I
swear I didn't even think about it but
I'm just gonna tap this underneath my
eyes and of course blend it out again
with that same brush because it's the
most amazing brush for blending out
under-eye products love it also gonna
drag a little bit of the concealer onto
my eyelid now taking the Revlon nearly
naked powder this is in medium taking a
big Brush just going to apply this all
over my skin just to set everything and
then going in with my hoola benefit
bronzer I'm going to use my new brush
from Mac is my first Mac brush ever
it's the 109 and literally it's the most
amazing contour brush ever it blends so
well and like I don't even have to go in
with a kabuki brush afterwards and blend
out lines because it just blends the
product so flawlessly so this was the
best purchase from a brush from Mac that
I've ever done like I'm so happy I
purchased it it was really expensive but
so worth it especially since I would use
it everyday
I'm gonna do a little bit of contouring
on the nose and I'm just gonna take this
urban decay little when is this brush do
you I gotten a palette I think it's from
The Naked 2 just gonna do a couple
little lines on my nose and I'm just
going to blend it out with the Sigma
precision round brush this is the P 82
and just gonna blend it a little bit
nothing too crazy
then taking one of my favorite blushes
which is Mac's Alpine bronze I'm going
to apply this on my cheekbones it's just
a really pretty bronze color and I'm
using the large angled contour at 40
from Sigma taking this eyeshadow base
from Sigma is in pursuade I've used this
for a while now I'm just going to apply
this all over my lid and also on my
lower lash line taking the new Sigma
Resort palette I'm going to take the
color topaz and just put this in my
crease with a blending brush and this
look I'm about to do is so simple and
it's great for everyday if you just want
a pop of color and I'm actually just got
this palette from Sigma so I've been
trying it out and this is definitely my
favorite go-to look with this palette
it's really really pretty
so again just blending this topaz color
all into my crease and even on my lid a
little bit then I'm going to take Luna
which is a really pretty kind of golden
shimmery color I'm going to put this in
my inner corners just to brighten up my
eyes
then I'm gonna take this revlon matte
shadow it's in peach sorbet so I'm just
gonna go ahead and ply this underneath
my brows just add a highlight taking the
Milani brow fix kit I'm gonna use the
darkest shade in this and I'm going to
fill in my eyebrows I love this little
kit I think it's perfect especially if
you are starting out with your eyebrows
this is a great way to kind of find your
right shade and see what you like best
so I definitely recommend this little
palette for your eyebrows taking the NYX
the curved eyeliner I'm just going to
line my eyes and of course do a winged
eyeliner what's new but I do really love
this eyeliner I've been using it for a
few months now and it's definitely one
of my favorites then I'm going to take
this little side of the duo the eyeliner
that comes in the Sigma Resort palette
it's called daydream super super
pigmented blue eyeliner just gonna apply
this on my waterline and kind of smudge
it underneath the lower lash line so
beautiful I love it on my brown eyes I
feel like it just really brings out you
know the different colors that I have in
my brown eyes and that's what it looks
like so blue I love it and I'm taking
the L'Oreal telescopic shocking
extensions mascara and applying quite a
few coats of this taking the liquid
highlighter that also comes in the
palette just going to put this on my
Cupid's bow and blend it out and then
for my lips I'm gonna go in with the
maybelline color whisper in petal rebel
on top of that I'm gonna be using the
wet and wild
Fergie daily which is just a really nice
nude and then on top of that I'm gonna
put the NYX sugar pie lip gloss and this
is just a really nice kind of nude pink
lip I like it so that's my new favorite
little lip combo and this is the look
just kind of a bronzed face and a pop of
color for spring so now it's this hair
I'm not going to spend a lot of time of
it but
I'm using the new me twenty
five-millimeter one and I'm taking
really big sections and I'm just going
to wrap it around the wand I don't want
this to be perfect just want to be messy
and like I said I'm not gonna spend a
lot of time on it because I have curled
my hair so many times in my videos I've
done so many tutorials so but I thought
I'd just include on what I did and when
I use so here you go just wrap it around
really thick sections and you'll have
really really gorgeous beachy waves and
of course going to my bangs I kind of
like to move the wand up and down
because I don't want it to be a super
perfect curl I just want to be a little
bit of a wave and kind of moving the
wand helps make it a wave instead of
just like a straight up curl and this is
what the hair looks like now I'm gonna
do now is just take this teasing comb
that I got from Sally's and it matches
my eyeliner so I like it and I'm just
going to tease around my hair I like big
hair lately so definitely all about some
teasing at the moment and I really like
this brush I think it's one of the best
teasing combs I've ever gotten
I think it's like four bucks at Sally's
I could be wrong but that's pretty much
it so I hope you guys enjoyed this video

and I will see you guys in my next video
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
