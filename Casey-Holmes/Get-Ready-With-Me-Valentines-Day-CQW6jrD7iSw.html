will see you guys in my next video
after we've primed our face I'm gonna go
in with Mack saddle and a Sigma e-40 and
I'm just going to blend this in my
crease this is gonna be our transition
shade and my Mac shadow palette is a
little beaten up I keep dropping it so
that's why it looks so rough
next color by Mac we're going to use
amber lights I absolutely adore this
color and I'm gonna take it with this
Sigma flat shader brush I'm just going
to put this all over my lid I will have
all products and stuff listed down below
if it all can't fit in the description
box I will link you to my blog for
direct links and things like that just
because I don't have enough room in my
description box anymore moving on to the
lorac Pro palette I'm going to take the
color expresso with a pencil brush and
I'm just going to outline my outer V and
bring this onto my lid just a little bit
and also a little bit in the crease and
don't worry about how sloppy this is
because we'll clean it up later
taking a regular blending brush I'm just
going to blend out that eyeshadow that
I'd just put on
next taking my concealer I'm just going
to clean up the outer edges of the
shadow and make it look nice and sharp
going back in with saddle I'm just going
to blend out any harsh lines I'm just
going to add a little bit more of a
transition shade right above that really
dark brown and just softly blending this
in there
then I'm gonna take a big fluffy brush
again and just blend out that transition
shade so it's not too harsh you guys
know I don't like harsh lines
going back in with that gold amber
lights color I'm just going to touch up
my lid to make sure it really pops
now moving on to face I'm going to take
my it cosmetics bye bye redness and
we're just going to apply this all over
my problem areas then for foundation I'm
using this Smashbox Studios Skin
Foundation and I'm just going to apply
it with my Sigma f80 and I end up going
in later with the Real Techniques sponge
and applying it that way as well next
taking my Mac Pro Longwear I'm just
going to apply this underneath my eyes
moving on to contour I'm taking my
Sephora bronzer in Los Cabos and just
doing a stronger contour for this look
again I do have a contour and
highlighting video that I'll leave down
below if you want something that's more
in depth taking Mac's Alpine bronze
blush this was limited edition so I'm
sorry but it's one of my favorite
blushes ever I'm just going to apply
this to my cheeks and then blend it out
with my duo fiber brush
taking this Mac highlighter and perfect
topping that's out in the new flowers
collection just going to highlight my
face
for brows I'm just lining them out with
the UH Nastasia brow Wiz and medium ash
and then I'll go in with my Sigma brow
powder in medium and fill them in
then I'm going to set them in place with
this Anastacio tinted brow gel in
brunette taking my favorite drugstore
eyeliner this is the L'Oreal super slim
infallible liner I'm just going to go
ahead and create my winged eyeliner
after that I'm going to line my upper
and lower waterline with this NARS
larger-than-life eyeliner
then I'm going to curl my lashes and
apply mascara and I'm using the
covergirl LashBlast then applying false
lashes these are my favorite at the
moment it's the kiss lashes in number
one and now moving on to this lorac Pro
palette and taking the color sable and
going to apply this underneath my lower
lash line and just really smoke this out
my lash glue is drying it actually takes
forever to dry I'm kind of over the
clear glue so if you have any other glue
recommendations then let me know but I
just applied that sable color underneath
my eyes and then I'm blending it out
with a larger blending brush don't mind
my crazy facial expressions
now I'm going to apply this Revlon
Colorstay lip liner in nude
and this lipstick is max close contact
it was in their limited-edition
collection with the magnetic nudes I'll
see if I can find it online for you guys
and then taking my whitening lightening
lip gloss in nude that I absolutely
adore now it's time to move on the hair
I finally got my megastar back in my
life I stepped on my last one if you
follow me on Twitter you know I was very
upset but I finally have a new one and I
absolutely adore this straightener and
if you are interested I do have a coupon
code for a hundred and twenty dollars
off below so you can go check that out I
think this came out with a lot of
different colors so I have the purple
one it's really pretty and I'm just
taking my tangle teezer and brushing
through my hair and following it with
the straightener just so I get a nice
sleek look
