morning routine video I hope you guys
enjoy it took forever to edit in film so
I really hope you liked it the first
thing I do is usually I wake up with by
Daisy she's usually wines or something
and I check all my social media sites
and then I let Daisy up into the bed and
I just lay with her and cuddle with her
and we high-five and stuff because she's
a really great high fiber if you don't
know I have Instagram video of her doing
it she's so funny so she's my first
priority in the morning I just like to
play with her and spend quality time
with her as much as I can and we also
had like a little mini photo shoot after
I filmed that first part so here's some
of her pictures I'm a proud mama look at
that cute little face okay so also after
I you know play with her a little bit I
take her out for her potty run yes I do
go out looking like this at the
apartments because I have nobody to
impress it about eight o'clock in the
morning so I come back in and I focus on
myself and I start brushing my teeth
that's the main priority right and then
after I'm done brushing my teeth I'm
going to go ahead and take a shower
shampoo I'm using is the bottle lodge
hydrating shampoo and then I go in with
my conditioner for the weekend it's the
macadamia deep repair mask face wash I'm
using is purity from philosophy and then
the body wash I love is the tone body
wash and then I use these two
moisturizers that take a deep breath
from philosophy I use that for my face
and then i use the Bobbi Brown hydrating
under eye cream for my eyes I use both
of these every day and every night I am
so obsessed with them I can't even tell
you enough then after I shower my hair
kind of air dry for just a little bit I
go in with a wide toothed comb you can
get these anywhere and I just wide
toothed comb my hair then taking the
kenra platinum blow-dry spray actually
right out of this in this video I was so
upset I had to get another one but I
love this stuff and then I take the big
sexy hair blow-dry volumizing gel I put
this all throughout my hair from roots
to ends I love this stuff I've been
loving big sexy hair products lately
just because I want really voluminous
hair speak in the big sexy hair I'm
going to take the
Rufe pump and I'm going to put this all
into my roots this is going to give that
extra volume I love this stuff it's used
so many different ways I like to put it
with in my hair when it's damp and then
blow-dry it but before I blow-dry I'm
going to use my argan oil from nume love
this stuff I still use it I've been
using it for a few months now like a
long time actually think since November
and I'm just going to put this in my
ends and I'll have everything I've
talked about in this video down below
along with coupon codes for a lot of
products as well so I'm using the new me
blow-dryer and I honestly have no
pattern to how I blow dry my hair I blow
dry upside down to the side to the other
side and I kind of just toss it all over
until it's completely dry I don't use a
brush when I'm blow-drying my hair I
just kind of toss it all around and then
I brush it out once it's all completely
dried and that helps with like a lot of
breakage and stuff so now I'm going to
put my hair up and then I'm going to
start off with this Urban Decay b6 spray
I'm trying to give this stuff a chance
so I'm trying to use it as much as I can
and then I'm going to with my benefit
Porefessional to help me out with some
of the pores I have on my face I love
this stuff I mentioned in my last haul
that I will link at the end of this
video for foundation I didn't have a
picture of it because this is a sample
but it's the NCE 35 Mac Pro Longwear
foundation I like this a lot I'm going
to blend it in with my Beauty Blender
and yeah just blending it blending it
and love the beauty blenders I have no
bad things to say about them other than
their pain to clean because it takes
forever I feel like going in with my Mac
Pro Longwear concealer zazz well I'm
going to put these underneath my eyes I
use and C 20 and 30 I just mix them
together and then again blend it out
with my Beauty Blender to make it
seamless and then set them in place with
this makeup forever transparent powder
setting my makeup with my benefit hello
flawless powder this is like in toasted
beige I do believe this also helps my
foundation match my neck and body a
little bit more then I'm going in with
my Mac what does it Paint Pot in soft
ochre and then bronzing my face with my
Mac mineralize skinfinish in give me Sun
I've been using this so much lately I'm
very proud of myself
I've kind of
come obsessed with it it's just amazing
then taking my new Mac blush it's called
Melba just going to apply this with my
blush brush and then starting off with
the eyes I'm going to take C TLAs
individual shadow and kit in this is so
beautiful if you've never tried it out
you need to I was skeptical too but
honestly it is so dang beautiful and
then I'm going to take the Naked basics
palette I'm going to use Naked 2 all
over the crease and just blending it out
with a fluffy blending brush and then
I'm going to take naked 2 and fight mix
together applying that on my lower lash
line with a pencil brush and this just
adds a little bit more depth for my
brows I'm going to use the same brow
routine that I have I have a video on it
I'll link it down below just using my
brow bar to go and if you want to see a
full in depth video I will link it like
I said in the bottom or now I'm taking
my all-time favorite liner this is
George Angus fabula nur is hands-down
the best one I've ever tried before and
then I'm taking w OS from The Naked
basics palette and I'm just using this
as a highlight as well and then going in
with my amazing adored mascara is the
YSL babydoll oh I can't get enough this
stuff you guys I can't say enough either
and then I'm going to line my eyes my
lower waterline is with the nude liner
from Rimmel and then the upper water
line was the covergirl ink it liner in
black now I'm lining my lips with
steelo's lip liner and aspiring this
helps my lips like a lot fuller so I
love that then I'm taking my MAC
lipstick in here which has been a
favorite of mine this month and if you
if you've seen it in videos and asked me
what it was it has definitely been this
one for the month then I'm taking mac
prolongwear lip glass in patience please
obviously love the pro longwear line so
definitely try it out so now I brushed
out my hair and I'm going to be putting
in a couple extensions I use three
West's and these are from Bellamy if
you've been watching me for a few months
now you know that I love Bellamy I
mentioned them a lot in my videos and my
favorites videos and also if you look in
the bottom bar I mentioned them a lot in
you know my hair section because I
always tell you what I curl my hair with
or straighten my hair with I usually
have my Bellamy extensions down there as
well I know I have really long hair but
I wear extensions to add
this and these are perfect I mean
they're honestly the only extensions
that I think are worth the money and
I've had a few companies send me
extensions and I won't even you know
feature them on my channel because I
just think they're kind of horrid like
they're really scraggly and thin and
they just don't look natural and they
honestly don't do anything for your hair
but I love these because they give me
the desire fullness that I want and it's
not a lot of effort either I mean three
wefts is not a lot to put in your hair
take the desired you know thickness that
you want I did dye mine to match my hair
color
they were a lighter brown but the darker
Brown that Bellamy has does match my
hair a lot better but currently I need
to use these because my hair is fading
and they match these extensions a lot
better well my hair is like freshly dyed
then they'll match the darker brunette
shade that Bellamy has so yeah and then
on this side I'm going to show you guys
I use the three no three clip weft over
here because I don't have that much hair
on this side so I like to add a lot of
fullness over here to kind of balance
out everything and if you guys are
interested I still do have my five
dollar off coupon for Bellamy that's
always going to be in the bottom bar for
you guys if you're interested and I
mentioned in my last video but if you
are going to beautycon I will be at the
Bellamy booth I would love to meet you
honestly I've never been to LA I've
never met anybody so I would love to
meet you please stop by the booth
they'll also have really great coupons
and stuff and you can definitely look at
the extensions and see if you like them
you know you kind of get a hands-on
experience so this is what the three
extensions look like in my hair as you
can see there's a lot of hair going on
right and I'm going to take my nume 25
millimeter one I also have a coupon code
for this down below I have a coupon code
for a lot of things in this video so
yeah I'm just curling my hair with this
you guys have seen me do this a ton of
times so if you want to see an in-depth
video I will link it below but I'm just
wrapping all the hair around the wand
and all the curls are going away from my
face it's really easy nothing too crazy
so
yep that's all I do it doesn't take that
much time at all honestly and then I
want to show you guys Daisy because I
looked over and she had her head around
the door and was like watching me it was
so cute I just love that dog
and this is what my hair looks like
after I've curled it I didn't brush
through them or anything I'm just
leaving them like this and then I'm
taking this straight and the straight
sexy hair smooth and seal I know it says
straight sexy that you can use this for
curly hair as well too so I just spray
this all throughout my hair just to kind
of give it some more shine as well make
sure it doesn't get frizzy or anything
like that and then this is what the hair
looks like and the makeup we're finally
done with it and I love it definitely my
go-to weekend look is really easy and it
kind of looks effortless right I don't
know so let's go on to my closet so now
we're in the closet and in Georgia is
kind of in chilly and rainy so I went
with something that was kind of more
fall inspired but nothing like long
sleeves or anything like that so this is
the outfit I chose it is a top from H&amp;amp;M
and I don't I like this top but it's
definitely not figure flattering so I
tucked in the side a little bit to kind
of show off my waist to show that I
actually had one and then I paired it
with these American Eagle jeggings
they're black my purse is by some girl I
forget I'll put her name below and then
my sandals are from forever 21 and
that's just my really easy casual look
I'm a very casual kind of person and
that's how I like it
so that's pretty much it I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I hope you
enjoyed seeing Daisy again she's getting
so big and yeah if you want to see a
nighttime routine please like this video
and I will see you all in my next one
