a get ready with me and this is the
makeup look that I wore and my Sephora
Mac haul video so we're just gonna go
ahead and it started the first thing I'm
doing is taking my Urban Decay v6 spray
shaking it up really well and I'm going
to apply this all over my face no I
don't notice a huge difference with the
pores redness or anything like that but
I like the way it feels on my skin so I
just like the spray this before I put on
any makeup now I'm taking my benefit
Porefessional and I'm just going to put
a good amount on my skin and all I'm
doing is just patting it in so it really
sinks into the pores and really helps to
shrink the size of them then I'm taking
my Mac prep and prime skin refines them
and I'm going to put this on top of that
and again patting it in this will help
keep me matte and it will also help with
pores as well so I love both of these
combined they're really really great now
taking my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
and I'm going to prime my eyes with this
I love this Paint Pot and I really
highly recommend it and I'm gonna be
taking my Cielo eyeshadow and kitten and
I'm going to first apply it my fingers
I'm just going to apply all over the lid
I like this color because it really
packs on nicely especially with your
fingers and this eyeshadow does have
quite a bit of Fallout but it's a really
beautiful eyeshadow just as long as you
tap off any excess before you apply
you'll be fine and then I'm going in
with this Mac brush I can't remember the
name but everything in this video will
be listed in the description box below
and I'm just packing on even more color
now I'm taking a soft Brown by Mac and
this is a Sigma brush I love it I think
it's like the e35 I can remember but I'm
just going to put this in my crease and
kind of put it all over just to kind of
have a transition say transition shade
and add some warmth to the eye look
and now I'm taking coppering by Mac and
I'm just going to apply this on my eye
and I love this color it's one of my
favorite favorite colors from Mac so I'm
taking the business card and angling it
up on the outer corner of my eye and I'm
just gonna start working coppering in
from the outer corner and into the
crease a little bit I want to focus more
of this color on the outer half instead
of bringing it in too much because I
want this Stila
eyeshadow to really just pop and then
have coppering on the outer half so
that's what I'm doing here and the
little business card will help give it a
nice sharp edge on the outer half which
I personally love and then what I like
to do is take this blending brush and
just go ahead and blend that in with
soft brown so it looks much more
seamless and I love this brush if you've
never checked it out I highly recommend
it it's my new favorite I even loved it
more than the black blending brush from
Sigma I don't know I just love the white
hair brushes a lot more I feel like they
blend so much better same with the e25
it's one of my favorite brushes now
taking kitten again with that Mac what
is it brush and I'm going to apply this
back on my lid just to help keep that
lid really nice and bright and I love
these two together they're both shimmery
but I think they look really really
great together so after you're done
packing that on you want to go ahead and
blend out again I'm taking the same
brush I used with my pop reading
eyeshadow which is the e25 and I'm just
kind of going in and touching up any
areas that I think needs to be touched
up and I'm also going to make sure the
outer half is really nice and sharp so
again I'm taking that business card and
I'm just going up to apply more
eyeshadow right there on the outer half
now I'm going to go ahead and use
foundations the covergirl three and one
I'm currently obsessed with this again I
just I don't know I've in love with it
once again so I'm using my Beauty
Blender to apply it which is one of my
favorite ways and you guys have seen me
apply foundation so many times so I kind
of just skip that step and just showed
you kind of the ending result and
personally the beautiful in there I feel
like is one of the best tools especially
for foundation it just gives you a nice
flawless finish
no brushstrokes or anything like that so
I really do recommend it it's amazing
taking my usual concealers which is the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer xym using NC
20 and 30 mix together we're just
applying these in a triangle underneath
my eye and then again going in with a
Beauty Blender and blending this out
which is my favorite way to blend out my
concealer then I'm taking my favorite
powder my makeup forever super matte
loose powder and once you set my under
eye with the f-86 from sigma as well and
then i'm setting my face makeup with the
mac prep and prime transparent powder
and I finally found my Sigma mister
bunny
powder brush so I'm using that to put
the fount put the powder on top of my
foundation and I am pressing this into
my skin and then what I'm doing here is
taking that same business card and I'm
just going to touch up the outer half of
coppering I want to make sure it's nice
and deep in the outer corner and then I
just blend in any excess into the crease
I'm taking kitten again and I'm going to
touch up the inner part of my eye and
I'm also going to apply this around my
tear duct area going til about halfway
with my eyeball and I want that whole
part right there the inner half to be
nice and bright with steelers kitten so
it's nice and shimmery and then what
we're gonna do is from the half point
all the way out to the outer corner
we're going to take copper rings and
just smudge that underneath our lash
line and I just really like the way this
looks
right
in this part I'm just fast-forwarding it
really really fast I'm taking the
Anastasia brow Wiz in brunette and just
filling in my brows this is my favorite
way to fill them in this brow pencil is
literally amazing I love it and then per
usual I'll take my Mac Pro and conceal
palette and then take the lightest shade
on on the yellow side and I'm just going
to touch up my brows and kind of sharpen
them out sharpen them I'm gonna just
starving them out with the concealer and
blend it out with this same Sigma a 15
brush and then I'm taking the Naked
basics highlight shade in w OS which is
walk with shame and I'm going to apply
this underneath my brows I forgot to
show it but that's the color I used if
you were wondering and now I just went
ahead and applied my liners and mascara
as the usual ones that I use so I'll
have all of those down below as well
taking my Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden
light and my Mac brush I'm just going to
bronze up my skin I think I contoured
when I did this look in my Sephora matte
call but I really didn't feel like
contouring today I just wanted to use
bronzer
you've got a smile thank you now I can't
remember what blush I used in that video
but I'm gonna take max honey jasmine and
apply this to my cheeks it's one of my
favorite colors and I feel like it goes
with so much and I'm taking my Real
Techniques nibbling brush and just
blending everything out so it looks nice
and seamless and then I'm going to apply
my bottom mascara or my lash my mascara
for my bottom lashes and this is my why
to sell baby doll mascara if you were
wondering and then next is lips I'm
going to be using my Stila lipliner and
aspiring which is my favorite I got this
off a hook look not too long ago and
it's so good well actually got a long
time ago but Stila was on there not too
long ago this is an amazing lip liner I
love it it's just a nice natural shade
and then I'm going to be taking max
creme Cup and want to apply this on my
lips I think I used hue in the last
video but I didn't have it on hand so to
make this a little bit lighter and less
pink I did take Mac's creme de nude and
pop this in the center of my lips just
to kind of lighten it up and not have it
so so pink cuz it was pretty pink in
person then taking my mac lipglass and
patience please I'm just going to top
that off and then you are done with the
look so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching I
will have my makeup look from the August
favorites coming soon for you guys and I
hope you enjoyed this and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
