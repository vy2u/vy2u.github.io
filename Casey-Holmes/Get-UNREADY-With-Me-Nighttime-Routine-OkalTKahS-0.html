unready with me I've had a ton of
requests to kind of see a video like
this of my nighttime routine so I
figured I'd show you guys today so
obviously the first step is to get the
hair out of the face so I'm gonna be
putting all this hair up in a messy bun
and I'm gonna go ahead and take the
Neutrogena oil-free cleansing wipes is
this pink grapefruit now I have just
purchased these facial wipes this day
because I ran out of my ones that were
in the blue packet and this is the only
kind that had this door and you can see
by my face I'm kind of like not loving
these facial wipes um they're really
strong and they just I don't like the
grapefruit smell at all I definitely
prefer the blue package of Neutrogena
facial wipes over this one because it is
not as harsh as these but I'm just gonna
take off all my I makeup and take off as
much mascara as I can I don't really try
to get all of the mascara off because my
face washed takes off literally almost
everything so look at that little nasty
cloth
you gonna take the Mario Badescu
glycolic foaming cleanser I got this
about two months ago off of HauteLook
for a really great deal and I love this
cleanser I'm just gonna go ahead and
rinse my face and then just apply this
face wash all over and I'm being really
gentle as well just taking over my eyes
and it really does take off all the
mascara foundation everything like that
it's completely takes it off so I only
wash my face once and we're gonna go
ahead and rinse off and then just pat
dry and I'm gonna show you guys here in
a minute I'm gonna take another facial
wipe and I'm gonna just go back over my
face just to make sure everything's off
because sometimes I get a little bit of
like eyeliner or mascara like right
underneath my bottom lower bottom lash
line so I'm just gonna run this over and
you'll see here in a minute that there's
like no face products on it just that
little bit of eyeliner that didn't come
off so look at it right there very own
that's a pretty clear facial cloth so
I'm gonna take my Cetaphil a little
control moisturizer and apply this all
over my skin this is my Holy Grail face
lotion I've used it for so long I'm
actually running out of it and I'm kind
of sad but I love it you can get at the
drugstore and it's great for oily skin
okay now I'm gonna be taking my
Dermalogica total I care I cream love
this stuff I just put some on my fingers
and I Pat this in I tried to be as
gentle as I can with my under eye area
so I'm always just trying to Pat and be
really really gentle underneath that
area because I do have some fine lines
underneath there and I don't want to
make them any worse and I really like
this under-eye cream makes it super
smooth and it's just really really nice
so I like it and that's pretty much it
you guys I'm really really simple and
then for spot treatments I like to use
the Mario Badescu drying lotion this is
amazing you don't shake it or anything
and just dip a q-tip in there and get
the solution on it dab it on your
problem areas and it'll be it all dried
up the next morning it's amazing I also
got all put look as well so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video leave your video
responses down below and I'll see you
next time right
I'm playing with dangerous not stranger
truth you're my house</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
