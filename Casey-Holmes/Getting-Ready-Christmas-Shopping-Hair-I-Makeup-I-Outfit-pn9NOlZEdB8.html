a getting ready video and I'm getting
ready to go Christmas shopping I thought
I would show you guys the kind of look
that I go for whenever I'm shopping or
Christmas shopping now since it is
following winter time of course I'm
loving the bold lip but when it comes to
foundation and stuff I'll stick to a BB
cream and when I know I'm getting ready
to go shopping I don't do eyeliner and
stuff like that so of course I skipped
out on the eyeliner but I had to have a
bold lip because it's one of my favorite
things about fall and winter so I have a
nice a bold lip I have to be comfy when
I go shopping so this is an awesome
outfit is so comfy but yet it's still
really cute at the same time at least I
think so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video please give it a thumbs up if you
did like it and I will see you guys in
my next video
okay so the first thing we're gonna do
is prime our face I'm taking the Mac
prep and prime scare and find zone and
then putting this in the center of my
face and I'm going to put the benefits
stay flawless 15-hour primer on the
outer portion of my face and I'm just
going to rub both of these into at my
skin and then for today we are going to
use a BB cream I'm using that Barnier BB
cream this one is for my oily skin girls
they have one for dry skin and they also
have one for oily skin I'm using the
color medium deep with my Real
Techniques buffing brush and I adore
this BB cream I think it's by far the
best one I have ever ever tried now
going to a concealer I'm taking this
Jane Cosmetics concealer in my Sigma
brush so I'm just going to buff this
into the skin it's not going to give us
a highlighted effect or anything it's
going to look more natural and just pick
away the darkness now I'm going to
bronze my skin with these Chanel so late
in day Chanel bronzer and I'm just going
to bronze up the skin because I'm not
going to be using a powder bronzer today
I'm just gonna use this cream bronzer
because I wanted to look a little bit
more natural but I still wanted to have
some warmth added to my skin now I'm
going in with my NARS powder in mountain
and I'm going to set everything in place
I love this powder it's not heavy at all
and it just looks really gorgeous on the
skin so I highly recommend this powder
now I'm going to prime my eyes with this
NARS primer by far the best primer I
have ever tried um in life he's my
eyelid so Matt and I love it now I'm
going in with this Smashbox halo
long-wear blush and passion this is a
very rosy color which is why I'm using
it with a duo fiber brush because it is
so pigmented I want to make sure I don't
apply too much and since I'm using this
duo fiber brush it is gonna make it look
like I have a natural flush to my skin
not like I'm wearing a whole lot of
blush on my face so I love that
technique and now I'm going in with this
in my eye shadow and balanced and I love
this shade it is so pretty it's like a
pinky gold champagne color it is
stunning though like that clip I just
showed you guys it does not do it
justice
it is so beautiful as you can see for me
putting on my eyelids now I'm going in
with the transition shade and I'm using
cinnamon from the palette which has been
my favorite transition shade for a while
now I think it is just absolutely
stunning and it just adds some warmth to
the look and it also defines the crease
so I'm obsessed with it now I'm taking
sugar milk from the warm neutrals
palette and want to highlight with this
and now I'm doing my brows because I
can't go anywhere without my brows being
done so I'm using my honest Asya brow is
in brunette and then I did try the
benefit gimme brow today and I really
really liked it so I'm going to set my
brows in place with the gimme brow
product now I'm going to curl my lashes
and then I'm going to tightline with my
NARS eyeliner in via veneto then I'm
gonna take Dove from the palette I'm
going to smudge this underneath my lower
lash line just to kind of smoke out the
look a little bit now it's time for
mascara i'm using the maybelline rocket
mascara and then you are done with the
eyes this is a really awesome look to go
to it's so easy so if you're just
starting out with makeup or something
this would be a beautiful look for you
because it's not hard to achieve and it
literally goes with everything so I was
gonna use the Revlon balm stain the
matte ones and shameless but I ended up
changing my mind
I did like the color but I just wanted
something a little bit darker so I went
ahead and I took that off and I lined my
lips with the NYX lip liner in deep
purple and for lipstick I used Mac's
rebel which is a gorgeous berry shade
it's really deep and then I topped it
off with the Revlon lip gloss and the
color was fuchsia finery now I'm going
to put dry shampoo in my hair because it
was pretty oily today I'm using the
batiste dry shampoo and I'm going to put
my hair in a side ponytail because I
think these look so elegant I feel like
it's not like you're trying too hard
it's so easy to achieve so I'm just
gonna take all my hair to the side of my
head
and make sure I have all my hair back
there and then I'm just going to tie it
if you want to be extra fancy with it
you can definitely take a piece of hair
and wrap it around the elastic so you
can't see it but I wasn't trying to be
extra fancy today I just hit really
casual so I'm just going to pull up at
the sides a little bit and at the top
just to create some more volume and then
pin back any pieces that did not want to
go in the hair tie and there you go you
have your hair out of your face and it
still looks really gorgeous at the same
time I love having my hair on my face
especially when I'm shopping because it
will drive me nuts
so now that hair and makeup are done I'm
gonna move on to outfit the little
cardigan thing I have on is from forever
21 my shirt is from Nordstrom my
leggings are from H&amp;amp;M they're like
leather leggings but with a side panel
so it kind of breaks them up and then my
boots I'll be showing you are from
HauteLook and my purse is from Michael
Kors so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video please give it a thumbs up if you
did and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
