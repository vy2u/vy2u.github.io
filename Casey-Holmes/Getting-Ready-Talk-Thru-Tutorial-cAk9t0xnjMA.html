a makeup tutorial on the look that I had
in my last video which was the
maybelline baby skin review and if you
haven't checked that out I'll link it
down below but I had a lot of requests
for that makeup tutorial and I actually
really loved it and I wanted to do a
tutorial on it so I'll be doing that for
you guys today and this is gonna be a
top 3 so it might be a little long but I
know I haven't in a makeup tutorial in a
while especially a taqueria so I wanted
to do one for you guys today we're gonna
get started and I'm gonna apply my
favorite primers so I'm using my benefit
Porefessional first I love this primer
it is so good next I'm going to put on
this Smashbox photo matte primer I have
been loving this this is a newer
purchase of mine and it has been really
really nice it is a like a thicker kind
of cream you can see it's not moving or
anything and it's really nice it does
keep me very matte keeps my makeup on
all day so I'm just gonna rub that
between my three fingers right here and
just I start from the center so that's
where I get the most oily and then I
work my way out and then for eyeshadow
gonna use my favorite one the NARS Pro a
smudge proof eye primer this is great if
you have oily eyelids or just have a
problem with eyeshadows creasing okay
now we're going to start with eyes I
have a couple of new purchases I have
the lorac Pro to go and then I have this
little mini one that I got in a set from
Ulta I've been really into Laura
products yeah you can get these at Ulta
Sephora no longer sells lorac but is it
lorac lorac whatever these both are
really really great palettes you can see
these shadows can be used for pretty
much anything and then the smaller one I
just completely smudged the eyeshadow
but this is also a great little palette
as well so we're gonna first start with
this one and take this light brown shade
with a sigma e40 and this is going to be
our transition shade so you just want to
buff this into the crease
now we're going to take a flat shader
brush I'm going to use this one from
Sigma it's the large shader e60 and
going into the lorac Pro to go palette
we're gonna mix shell and pearl which
pearl is definitely like more of a pearl
shadow and then shell is matte so we're
just gonna mix the two together and I
definitely recommend tapping off the
excess of these shadows because they are
so pigmented but they do have quite a
bit of Fallout
okay going back in that same palette and
we're going to take a sigma e25 brush
which just looks like this could take
this color cafe which is just a little
bit darker than light brown and we're
going to put this directly into the
crease you don't want to go too far up
with this or too far down you just want
to focus it and mainly right there in
that crease
I'm to the mini pallet we're going to
take this matte Brown this is the color
expresso it's very very very dark but
beautiful at the same time and the brush
we're going to use for this shade is a
different brush that not a lot of people
will use I feel like this is one of my
go-to brushes for if I'm doing a darker
smoky eye and I want to do some color
out in the outer V this is the Sigma
blending e36 and you can see it's just
like a tapered blending brush it's a lot
smaller than the Sigma e25 and it's just
a lot easier to have more control when
you're blending this kind of blends kind
of all over the place and this one's
more precise so I really like this one
obviously I used two for the shade not
too long ago but it's pretty amazing I
highly recommend it if you're looking
for a brush that you want to have more
control when you're blending because
this can be it right into the crease and
the outer V perfectly so I'm going to be
taking this little sheet that I got in a
little mini palette I'm going to use
this as my kind of like guide line right
here it's gonna be kind of hard the
mirror so far away but we're gonna line
it from our lower lashes up to our brow
and then we're going to take that
Express show don't really tap off the
excess and we're gonna start here in the
outer corner we're gonna focus this
color on the outer half in the outer V
four start down here the base of lashes
kind of blend a little bit on the lid
again using a very light hand and I'm
gonna work my way up just like this
dragging a little bit into the crease
not much just whatever's left over and
just really focusing this the outer half
okay take this off now we can clean up
this line later see how it's a little
crooked but the main reason why I like
doing this is because I do have droopy
eyes so I really like to make the eye
shadow go up and out okay so then back
to over here usually I use concealer to
clean up all of this this is such a dark
shadow that I figured I'll do most of it
with this little sheet and then I'll go
back in with concealer and really define
the line
I'm taking a little bit of concealer
just using my same Mac palette right
here with a concealer brush and that's
what our eyes shadow is looking like now
now we're going to go in again with the
Sigma e25 back into that eye color or
cafe I'm sorry I'm a little shy and
we're going to blend this on the lid
between the shell and pearl and the
darker shade we just put on just to kind
of buff it all out yeah
it's going to take a little bit right
above that black to blend out just a
smidge
now what I'm going to do really quickly
is take shell again which is that matte
cream just gonna tie this right here and
the inner part really lightly just to
kind of brighten it up a little bit more
just blend out any lines you might have
okay now what we're gonna do is just go
ahead and move on in the face and then
come back to the eyes it's usually how I
do my makeup looks I do the basic eye
shadow and then I do my foundation and
stuff and then I come back and clean up
everything do my brows and all of that
so we're just gonna get started with the
face okay so today I'm going to be using
a different foundation I'm going to be
using the lorac Pro vection foundation I
got this the other day and I really do
like it the only thing I have to say
it's about a medium coverage and I mean
it's medium to full but for a makeup
like this I want a really nice full
coverage finish so what I do when I want
foundations to look completely full
coverage that are more to medium to full
I'll take this it cosmetics bye bye
redness because the main thing that
doesn't get covered with foundations on
me is my redness so I'll just take this
and I'll just put it right over my
problem areas I have a first impression
on this product and I'll leave it down
below for you to check out but I have
been in love with this I think it is
absolutely amazing I actually have a new
favorite drugstore foundation and I like
to use it in combination with this just
so it's a nice flawless finish
it's the Neutrogena skin clearing
oil-free makeup blemish treatment with
salicylic acid and this stuff is so good
like it leaves a beautiful finish on
your skin it doesn't make me greasy and
I love it with the it cosmetics just
because it's not again a completely full
coverage finish like I usually like but
I put a NARS pump on this because it's
so hard to eat the foundation out of the
bottle unless you have a pump so the
NARS foundation pumps do fitness I'll
leave a link to the NARS as well down
below if you wanna check that out but
I've actually been using a ton of this
I'm almost halfway through the bottle if
you want me to do a full like foundation
routine review with it then let me know
so the color I have is golden tan and
it's literally the perfect shade for me
when I'm nice and self tan like it
matches so well and I do like the finish
of this foundation I don't necessarily
think it completely helps oh like pores
or anything but I love the finish of it
and it looks really nice on my skin and
doesn't make me greasy or anything like
that so I'll be using the Real
Techniques sponge that I did a first
impression on and just going to apply
this all over my skin
for concealer I'll be using my Mac Pro
Longwear in NC 30 plus underneath
triangle motion work it back and also
here in the inner corner because I get
really dark right in here I want to make
sure and cancel that out I know it's a
lot of concealer you don't have to do
this much but I love my concealer I'm
also gonna take a little bit here my
chin upper lip nose a little bit in the
forehead just a little bit of
highlighting okay now to get the inner
corner right here where I have like a
lot of Darkness I'm going to take my
ring finger I'm just gonna kind of press
it in okay now it's time to set our
foundation I'm going to be using this
makeup forever super matte loose powder
and I want to use my Sigma F 86 brush
I'm just using this to set my under eye
concealer then I'm gonna go in with my
Clinique invisible Matt I like to press
mine into my skin just so I don't move
any foundation or concealer around the
contouring today I'm going to use the
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I do
have a full in depth contouring and
highlighting video if you want to check
that out down below
okay now we're going to finish up the
eyes I'm going to take one of my new
favorite drugstore liners this is the
l'oreal infallible super slim liquid
eyeliner
okay and then now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take my NARS
larger-than-life eyeliner this is a via
veneto whatever and I'm going to line my
upper and lower waterline now what we're
going to do is take a pencil brush and
in the lorac Pro to go palette we're
going to take this color it is called
mink and we're going to apply this
underneath our lower lashes then it's
time to curl our lashes and apply
mascara and their lashes I'm going to be
using today are these two salon and
perfect demi whispies and then I'm going
to fill in my brows which I'm gonna do a
full brow routine really soon so just
stay on the lookout for it but I'm going
to use my on estancia brow as pencils in
brunette and medium ash and want to set
them with my brow gel in brunette okay
so these are the eyes and eyebrows done
the lashes make such a huge difference
I'm going to take shown the palette and
I'm gonna highlight underneath my brow
okay now moving on to lips I am gonna
line my lips with this Revlon Colorstay
lip liner in noon yes nude just like
that and then I'm going to use the
lipstick from NYX these are their new
butter lipsticks and this one's in
snowcap and then I'm going to top it off
with my lip gloss from Mac or my
all-time favorite ones it's called full
or abundance and then that's the makeup
I hope you guys enjoyed this video give
it a thumbs up if you liked it and I'll
see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
