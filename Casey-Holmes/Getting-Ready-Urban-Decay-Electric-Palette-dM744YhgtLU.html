all about this makeup look and I figured
I would step out of my neutrals and warm
colors comfort zone again do something a
little bit different now
Sunday I went to picked up the Urban
Decay electric palette and I have been
playing with this everyday
ever since I'm literally obsessed with
this palette a lot of you didn't think
that I would get this bad boy because I
never play with colors like this but I
kind of wanted to prove you wrong so I
went on it and decided to play around
and I'm absolutely in love with it you
guys I have used almost all of the
shades other than these three right here
I've used all the rest of these shades
and different looks I posted a picture
on Twitter that Sunday night with a pink
purple and blue look that I did and
which I'll put it somewhere in this
video so you guys can see it um if you
wanted to try on that look too then just
like this video and let me know because
I loved that look as well but when I sat
down to film this look today I want to
play with the greens they are all so
pigmented the payoff is absolutely
amazing I will say you do teaches a
primer with these shadows because I have
heard from other people that when they
didn't use a primer it stay in their
eyeballs which I always use the primers
with eyeshadow like I never I don't ever
not use a primer I have to because I
have very oily eyelid so I've never had
an issue with them standing my eyes and
they come right off
I use a clinic eye makeup remover and it
just swipes right off and I have no
issues another thing I really quickly
want to address is it says the warning
on the warning label I'm sure a lot of
you know this but it says slow burn
savage jilted at urban or not intended
for the immediate eye area but I've used
all of those colors mentioned other than
slow burn on my lid right here
underneath my lower lash line and I
haven't had any issues with it hasn't
you're doing about
I made a burn nothing like that I've had
no issues so and just beware if you have
sensitive eyes that they do have that
warning label on there so just be
careful with those shadows you want to
make sure you don't have a reaction and
stuff to that thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and don't forget to subscribe to
my channel to not miss out on any videos
and if you want to see how I got this
makeup look then just keep watching the
video bye okay so first off already
applied my primers and we're gonna go
ahead and move on to eye shadow I'm
taking Mac soft brown with a sigma e40
and I'm just blending this all over my
crease just to add is a transition shade
so now I'm gonna put some tape on I'm
going to angle this from the lower lash
line up and then we are going to go
ahead and take our two colors I'm using
thrash and freak I'm mixing them both
together and applying this all over my
lid so make sure you just pack this
color on and it's really nice and green
next I'm gonna take the pink in the
palette which is called savage and I'm
going to be applying this with this dome
brush I forget the number but I'll leave
it down below I'm gonna be applying this
a little bit right above the crease and
I'm just going to apply this all the way
into the inner corner and also right
there in the outer V just to help blend
it in with that green now when I first
saw this I was like oh my gosh this is
so watermelon because I do not like pink
and green together but it all ends up
working out so don't worry so then I'm
gonna go in and blend I'm blending a lot
in this video so just remember keep
blending no matter what these eyeshadows
do blend very very nicely so just keep
going at it now taking the amazing
cobalt blue in this palette which is
called chaos when I showed it earlier in
the intro it looked purple but it's
definitely a true cobalt blue and I'm
taking it with that same brush that I
applied the pink with and I'm applying
it right to the outer V and then I'm
going to blend that out and what we're
gonna do is just build this color I did
it about two or three times I would go
in add chaos and then blend out with
like I'm doing here and then I'll go
back in and add a little bit more color
because I want that area to be really
nice and deep but still really blend it
at the same time so just take your time
with it going in as many times as you
need to to get it nice and blue just
keep that in mind just keep building
this color and it will work out I
promise
now I'm taking these two primers from
bareMinerals and one is an old control
primer and the other one is a BB primer
so it's gonna help counteract some of my
redness so I'm just going to go ahead
and apply those all over my skin don't
mind the bun it's looking crazy taking
L'Oreal True Match nw6
and my Beauty Blender I'm going to be
applying this all over my skin as you
can see it does not match my face but it
does match my self tanned bodies
after that we're going to apply our
concealers I'm using the Mac Pro
Longwear and also the NARS concealer the
radiant creamy concealer I believe is
called and I went ahead and applied the
NARS concealer on my nose and just
blended that out and I'm gonna take the
Mac Pro Longwear and highlight my face
of this and also conceal my under eyes
so I'm going to put this in a triangle
shape underneath my eyes put it on my
lip my chin and also my forehead just to
really highlight those areas taking the
anasazi a contour kit and the middle
banana shade I'm going to set all of the
areas that I highlighted with this color
and then for the rest of my face makeup
I'll be taking the Laura Mercier
translucent powder translucent powder is
my favorite I rarely ever use like a
colored powder so yeah now taking this
sculpting powder in the color school
from Mac this was in the newest
collection that came out I can't
remember what it's called but on they do
have this in the permanent collection as
well they just repackaged it for that
collection but I'm just using that to
contour my face and I am using the NARS
eita brush I do have a full contouring
and highlighting video down below so I
will make sure to link that video for
you guys so you can get a more detailed
tutorial on that next I'm taking Mac's
blush in Melba this is the perfect blush
for this look because it does not
overwhelm the face it doesn't look like
too much color
it's the perfect neutral blush and it
goes along with this eyeshadows so well
and then I'm taking this Becca
highlighter and opal which is just been
my all-time favorite lately and I'm
going to highlight the tops of my
cheekbones and also my Cupid's bow
I'm going to fill in my brows which I
will have my full brow video down below
and I will also have my winged eyeliner
in lashes tutorial linked below just so
you guys can check that out because they
are a process so this video would be
like forever long if I included all of
them going back in with thrash I'm just
going to apply this right over that
green again to make sure it's nice and
vibrant and I'm sorry this is so far
away I totally forgot to zoom in and now
I'm just going to go in with the e-40
and blend a little bit to make sure
there's no harsh lines taking my nards
liner in via veneto
which is just a black liner I'm going to
line my waterline and I also line my
upper waterline as well and then this is
me being all excited it's not chatting
so forgive me okay now we're gonna go
ahead and take those same green shades
again I would just recommend going in
with freak because freak shows up a lot
better on the lower lash line and then
thrashed it on me at least and I really
like the way that it looked so I ended
up just taking freak all over the lower
lash line I take it from the inner
corner to about halfway on my eye and
then I go in with that blue the chaos
color and then I put this color from the
middle of my eye to the outer V so you
kind of have the green in the middle and
then the blue on the outer half to just
kind of go along with the lid as well
then I'm taking the Clinique bottom lash
mascara which is an amazing mascara
and taking max room I will just be
highlighting my brow bone with this
color after that we're gonna lie on our
lips I'm taking max trip down which has
been an all-time favorite and I'm
applying this to my lips per usual and
then I wanted to keep a nude lip if you
want to go extra bold I would recommend
like Max heroine or something but I
wanted to keep it kind of you know
simple and I went with a nude so I'm
taking max creme de nude and I'm topping
that off with the whitening lightening
little applause and nude because those
were just a little too pale so this lip
gloss really helped make everything look
nice to put together and then you are
done you guys so I hope you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching of
everything I use it listed in the
description box below and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
