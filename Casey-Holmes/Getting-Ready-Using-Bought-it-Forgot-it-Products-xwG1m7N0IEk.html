let's talk getting ready video and I'm
gonna be using the products I just
showed you in my video from yesterday
which is the bought it forgot it video
series that I'm doing on my channel now
and I had a ton of requests for you know
a getting ready kind of tutorial with
the products I showed so I mean I'm
supposed to use Elysee products this
month so I definitely wanted to do a
video for you guys especially since you
requested it first I'm gonna start off
and prime my eyes with Mac Paint Pot in
soft ochre I haven't done like a makeup
tutorial in about a week mainly because
my skin has literally been horrendous I
was gonna do one last week and then my
skin was just too bad because I've told
you guys before I do have a rosacea and
I she gave me a cream and I used the
cream in the first day my redness was
literally gone like I could not believe
it it was so weird seeing my skin
without any redness you know just with
bare skin but then the second day I used
it and my skin was burning and I had the
most intense breakouts like it was
really bad like I couldn't even look at
it cult said that it was the worst kids
ever seen my skin I was like I'm not
filming makeup tutorial with my skin
looking like this so that's why I had to
in film any I was gonna do another
Thanksgiving look but the makeup was
just not working my transition shade I'm
gonna go in the lorac Pro palette I'm
gonna use taupe I'm just letting that
into my crease really lightly because
that's a pretty pigmented shade just
blend that in the crease and if you guys
are wondering Sigma is having a 20% off
all their brushes today since it is
Cyber Monday so go check that out down
below if you're interested I'll leave a
coupon code or you can get 20% off and I
also wanna let you guys know that I plan
on doing five videos a week until
Christmas so video every day during the
week because I want do something special
for Christmas I don't know I just want
to do something different
and my figurative video everyday would
be great and I've already got my videos
planned out so I'm very excited and
super sided okay so I'm going into the
nude tude palette I'm going to take this
shade which is called silly and I'm
going to put this all over the lid thing
we're gonna do is two darker look today
so just put that all over the lid it's a
very tricky color looked more of a
reddish color with sparkles not so much
a dark brown so that's interesting but
we'll go with it right so now I'm just
blending out the edges of that shadow
that I just put on I'm gonna take this
thing that II 25 and I'm going to go in
with I think I'm a sexy right here which
is like a really pretty burgundy looking
color this is what I thought the color
not a problem that was gonna be a
burgundy with shimmer in it because
that's what it looks like in the palette
but it's definitely not I'm gonna focus
is right here in the outer part of the
crease also blending it into the outer
corner
and brush again and blend this out
like that color sexy it's really pretty
kind of darker burgundy shade I like it
a lot it's really nice quickly I'm going
to take this Mac Pro concealer palette
and clean up the edges
cuz this eye is get on my nerve stick it
with a sigma v 75 don't worry foundation
and stuff will cover this concealer up
so you aren't you to worry about it
Ted wipe my face because I put on the
Revlon Colorstay whipped foundation and
I figured I'd try it again because um
you know it's been a while since I had
you know get in a go and it just did not
work out it looked so bad so I'm
applying my primers again and we're
gonna go with the trusty Kat Von D
lock-it tattoo foundation because that
was just real bad okay so like I said
taking the Lockett tattoo foundation
from Kat Von D and she's this Sigma know
kabuki f-84 to apply today if you guys
want to see me do a review on this
foundation I will link it down below I
did one not too long ago like last week
so you can go check that out below I go
in with the Maybelline where'd it go
where's that concealer instant age
rewind and light playing underneath my
eyes the triangle motion taking the
favorite Sigma f80 six and blending it
out okay now we're going to set
everything with the NARS translucent
crystal powder personally you know from
using this powder I don't see anything
that's like oh my gosh have to have it
like I don't feel like it's that great I
think you could buy the Mac translucent
powder you know the prep and panna cotta
that I talked about and that will do
great things for your skin but this one
I'm just not a big fan of alright now
I'm going to take the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer I am determined
to get this bad boy used up this month
because it is it looking like it's about
their pants so and I just hit pan on my
hoola bronzer from benefit so I'm really
hoping I can get just used up I'm gonna
take this thing the large powder f20 and
first we're gonna bronze the face so
just add some color to it and some
warmth top this bronzer smells so good
mmm my people say they've tasted it but
I haven't I want I kind of want to taste
it just to see how good it tastes okay
and now we're going to go in with the
NARS brush that eita whatever they call
it and just do a stronger contour so I'm
just going to kind of line it out right
there
from forehead to contour that big ol
forehead that we come down to the nose
and underneath the lip
see even if a foundation is a little too
light for you once you use bronzer and
stuff it'll get better
now for blush today I'm gonna use NARS
dowser deucer
a lot of people told me it was deucer
last time I read about this they told me
it was do OS IR so I'm gonna go with
what the people say and call it juicer
but it's do you see E you are this is a
gorgeous shade I it to my cheeks right
um blend out when I do a fiber this is
the Sigma at 50 I love that freaking
blush I can't believe I don't use it
often I'm gonna start using it more
because this is so pretty oh love it
I'm gonna go with sexi which is that
burgundy shade that I showed you guys
earlier that I'd deepen the crease with
I'm going to take the Sigma flat definer
a 15 and I'm going to put this right
underneath my lower lashes close to them
as I can possibly get without messing up
too much
and taking a pencil brush
I literally just hide okay and taking
sultry and the palette which is right
there tapping off all that excess and
I'm going to blend out that color you
flicking it back a little bit towards
the outer V so filling in the brows
today we're using the anasazi a brow Wiz
and a brunette which is what I've been
using a ton i've actually went through
one of these already so this is a newer
one i'm just going to fill these bad
boys and I'll just kind of show you the
aftermath since it does take quite a
minute brows literally make such a
difference in a makeup look like you
wouldn't think it but they really do now
I'm gonna highlight underneath my brow
bone with cream from the lorac Pro
palates just gonna put that right
underneath the highpoint on my brow just
kind of lift it up even more give it
that illusion that it's really lifted
but I'm gonna use the Maybelline line
stiletto I'm going to line my upper
lashes and I am going to wing it out
and now what I'm going to do is align my
waterline with smolder which is another
product of trying to use up I'm also
going to tightline with this which is
line the upper waterline whoo-hoo I like
this look so far nice and smoky and
missing the rocket mascara which is
actually really great volumizing mascara
just sucks to take off to finish off the
look we're going to do lips I'm going to
take this from a lip pencil what is it
Chrome a joystick and modern mop it's a
very nude lip pencil kind of looks like
I'm wearing concealer on your lips it's
not even gonna lie
neither line my lips hold on and lining
my lips with this Revlon Colorstay liner
just so you can see the outline of my
lips and then we're going to top it off
with this Sigma lip gloss and hint that
I'm obsessive I don't think I put a lip
gloss in their night in like I should
highlight really quickly I'm going to
take this NARS samurai palette and I'm
going to take the Sigma for highlighting
brush which i think is the f-35 yes and
I'm gonna take that highlighting
straight in here I'm going to just pop
that on the tops of my cheekbones just a
highlight okay and that is the makeup
look just lit for more of a smoky eye
which I really like it's fun to do a
smoky eye right I plan on doing another
one because I'm doing a Christmas party
kind of get ready look this week so
you'll be seeing that soon but I hope
you guys enjoyed it and I will see you
in my next video
