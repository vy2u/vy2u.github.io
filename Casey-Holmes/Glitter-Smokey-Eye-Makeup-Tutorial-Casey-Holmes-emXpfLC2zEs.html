a makeup tutorial on this look it's just
a fun glittery so yeah you guys know I
love my deep looks so definitely want to
do a smokey eye today I wanted to play
with the urban decay diamond dog shadow
which you'll see in the video I love it
it's so pretty asked you guys on Twitter
which one you want to see it was either
that one or this one from Stila which is
called citrine I don't know but this is
a really pretty like antique gold color
but the majority of you wanted the urban
decay one so that's the one I played
with today and yeah I really hope you
guys like it I know it's more dramatic
but it's just fun it's fun to kind of
amp things out a little bit once in a
while if you're like me you smoke it out
about 4 or 5 days out of the week I'm
just saying hope you guys enjoyed this
look if you do like it then please give
it a thumbs up and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you all in my next video bye okay guys
so the first thing we're going to take
is this lorac pro palette we're going to
take the color taupe and put this all
into our crease this is going to be our
transition shade and it's always good to
have a nice transition shade with a look
like this because you want it to fade up
into the brow
and then I'm gonna take some tape I had
forgotten to do this and I'm just
putting it down and putting a little bit
more taupe into the crease now we're
going in with black and we're taking a
pencil brush and we're just gonna put
this in the outer V and then we're gonna
take it all the way to the center of the
eye so this is gonna be very very
dramatic but keep in mind we're gonna
keep blending and it's all gonna come
together at the end I promise
so again just put that black in the
outer V and take it to the middle of the
eye then I'm going to take taupe again
and we're just gonna blend this out this
look is all about adding color and
blending as you go along because it is
so dramatic and so smoky you just want
to make sure you kind of take the time
to really blend all of these out and
topes a really good color to blend this
with because it's not too dark it's not
too light and it also is you transition
shade
then I'm going to take sable and we're
gonna put this in the inner corner of
the eye and also the very outer corner
of the eye as well and just connect it
into the middle this is just gonna
deepen it up a little bit I didn't want
to do black on this part I just wanted
to do a darker Brown so sable is the
perfect color and you can see I'm
leaving the center part of my lid bare
because I don't want to put anything
and then once you edit that again you're
just gonna go back in and blend
everything out then I'm gonna take the
Urban Decay eyeshadow in down way well I
almost sat down were dog again oh I
forget when it's called Diamond dog
there we go and I'm gonna take my brush
and spray it then I'm also gonna put
down this Too Faced shadow insurance
this is a glitter glue I do it one eye
at a time because it does dry pretty
quickly but I love this stuff for
pigments loose eye shadows anything it
is absolutely amazing so I'm gonna put
the eye shadow from Urban Decay on top
and it should really gonna help the
glitter adhere to it so it doesn't go
flying all over the place and I just
love this stuff like once again I'm
gonna put on the eye tap it out and then
put that Urban Decay shadow on top I'm
tellin you it's just amazing if you need
any kind of eye shadow to really stay
put on the lid you need this Too Faced
primer it is so so good
so what I'm gonna do here for the next
minute or so is I'm basically going back
in with these colors and deepening it up
I'm doing the same thing with the
glitter eye shadow so I'm gonna go back
in with the black and really deepen that
up and make it look nice and bold and
then blend it out and then again I'm
gonna go back in with the Diamond Dogs
shadow and put more on top just because
I want everything to be nice and opaque
and look kind of clean and put together
so that's just basically what I'm doing
here just taking the same shadows and
right here I'm taking sable and I'm just
putting that right back into the crease
and then I'm gonna blend it all with
taupe it's just all about going back and
forth you can make it as dark or as
light as you prefer of course I wanted
this to be a really deep look so I'm
going back in it quite a few times I'm
sorry if you can hear roses color
he's walking but that's all the jingling
in the back she's looking at me now
she's like mom quit talking about me
after we're done with all of the
blending and everything I'm gonna take
an eyeliner and I'm gonna put it right
on my upper lash line a very very thin
line just to define the eye and then I'm
gonna put lashes on and then we'll move
on to the face
now my face makeup totally I can't find
that clip you guys I cannot find the
clip of me applying foundation concealer
and my bronzer but I'll leave everything
I use down below it was mostly drugstore
so I'm sorry I can't find it I'm so sad
about it you guys have no idea where it
is or what happened to it but I'm gonna
take this Maybelline blush and put it on
top and then just blend that out and
then for highlight I'm going to use
heatwave from Estee Lauder which is
relaunching again very soon so you guys
keep an eye out for it but I'm taking
heatwave and highlighting with this and
like I said I'm so sorry about the
foundation it's like my favorite part
but I don't know where it is so then I
took the NYX eyebrow gel and just filled
in my eyebrows with it and it is my
favorite right now I just absolutely
love it then I'm taking the anasazi up
brow gel and brunette and setting it in
place going in with cream I'm going to
highlight the brow bone and then taking
a coal liner from Sigma I'm just going
to put this on my waterline and then
we're gonna go in with expresso or
espresso from the lorac palette and put
this on the lower lash line you want to
really press this close to that lower
lash line so we don't have any spaces of
skin or anything you want it to be
really smoky and vamped out and then
we're going in with the tried-and-true
taupe again and just blending that out
to make it really nice and smoky and
I'll have a super harsh line underneath
there
after you smoked it out you're just
gonna put on your lower at mascara I'm
using this one from Maybelline it's
think it's the lash sensational one then
I'm gonna take stripped down lip liner
from Mac and just line my lips with this
it's a great neutral lip liner and then
topping it off with the Too Faced melted
lipstick in a melted nude so I hope you
guys enjoy this look and thank you so
much for watching don't forget to like

it and I will see you all in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
