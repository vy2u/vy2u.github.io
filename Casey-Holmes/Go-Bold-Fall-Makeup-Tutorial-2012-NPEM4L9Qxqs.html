be a makeup tutorial on what I have on
right now this is basically what I've
been loving so far this season I'm just
a really bold lip a little bit of smoky
eye not too much and a really nice
strong contour so if you want to see how
I got this makeup look then just keep
watching so today we're gonna be using
the Naked palette and I'm gonna first
take sidecar and half-baked and mix
those two together and I'm just gonna
apply these two all over my lid if
you're wondering what brushes I'm using
in this video they are all Sigma and I
will also put like an exact description
in the bottom bar so be sure to check
that out if you're interested in exact
which brush I'm using now I'm taking
naked and I'm just going to apply this
in my crease and just blend it out
really really well
now I'm going to take an angled brush
and I'm going in with dark horse and I'm
just going to kind of feather this out
in the outer corners in my eye I don't
want to go in too far and then I'm also
going to drag it underneath my lower
lash line now I'm just blending this out
just so it's not so harsh
then I'm going in with virgin and sis
gonna be my highlight so I'm just gonna
put this underneath my brows and also in
the inner corners of my eyes
now I'm going in with this Kat Von D
liner and I'm just going to do kind of a
more dramatic winged liner
and I'm also going in with a q-tip just
to make it a little bit more precise now
I'm going in with smolder for Mac and
I'm just going to line my waterline with
this if you can guess what I'm singing I
will love you forever it's my new
favorite song and I'm going to get
pencil brush and going a back in with
Dark Horse I'm just going to smudge this
underneath my lower lash line just to
give it a more smoky effect
now it's time to curl your lashes and
apply mascara I'm going to be using the
falsies black drama with my top lashes
and then I'll eventually go in and let
me use covergirl lash perfection on my
lower lashes and that is the complete
eye makeup now we're going in with hoola
benefit bronzer or the benefit hoola
bronzer with my Sedona lace contour
brush and I'm just going to contour my
face really heavily just in the hollows
of my cheeks and up on the tops of my
temples don't be scared I know it's
really harsh but it's supposed to be
really harsh and then we'll blend it out
so don't get nervous so after I've
applied all that I'm taking this off
kabuki brush and blending it out if you
could to have it own like purchase this
kabuki brush you really to try it out
awesome so I'm going to take this NYX
lip liner in jewel and I'm just going to
line my lips and I don't do this precise
or anything like that I just do a rough
estimate
now I'm going in with CoverGirl's eforea
which is one of my new favorite colors
so pretty and I'm just going to apply
this all over my lips
so that's pretty much the whole makeup
look guys I hope you enjoyed it I really
really loved it for fall so if you try
this out don't forget to send me
pictures let me know how it goes on
Twitter and Facebook and I will see you
