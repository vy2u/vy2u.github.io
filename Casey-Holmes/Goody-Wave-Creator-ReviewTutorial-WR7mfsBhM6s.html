be about a new curling iron I got so the
first thing I want to talk about is the
packaging now I'm absolutely in love
with it because it is so sleek and easy
and just to the point I love that
there's bullet points on the back a
little tutorial on the side it's just
amazing also let me say when I first
heard the word goodie I kind of thought
cheep
I don't know why it's kind of rude but I
thought of like the cheap hair
accessories you get at Walmart and stuff
like that I just felt like it would
probably be a cheap curling iron but
after seeing some tutorials on YouTube
and reviews on it I was like okay I'm
gonna go fit is that because everybody
is in love with it so I picked it up and
I have to agree I'm super in love with
it as well so I'm gonna go over the
packaging real quick and then we'll get
to the wand so it just says wave creator
has a pretty girl on the front and three
bullet points that are also on the back
they're just right there and then like I
said you have a little detour and then
the back it shows you the wand and the
bullet first I just wanna say this is
super duper lightweight so I really
really like that okay so it says it's a
wavy barrel which creates loose natural
waves I don't think it creates super
loose waves but it does create like you
know curly waves but what I really like
about it is it's not really spiraling
because you do the same technique but
you get different results every time so
it gives you more volume with the
different kind of curls that you've got
oh and I really really love it so a plus
in haste of 410 degrees with a 30 second
heat up on this does get SuperDuper hot
it's a 1 to 10
um scale right here so you can do one
and then the heist is obviously 10 and
also another little thing is it has a on
and off button and whenever it's getting
ready it blinks but when it's fully
heated it will be completely red so I
really like that it's also ceramic and
ionic for smooth frizz free waves and it
also has 10 heat settings like I just
showed you it has an auto shop so if
you're a girl on the go like me or if
you're just kind of forgetful auto shop
is a blessing so I really like that
about this Oh
360 degrees so liqueur which is amazing
if you watch my videos I'm nice to do
and me curling my hair with that my cord
for it is so crinkly now like I'm just
waiting for it to die oh yeah this is
really great for that and then there's
EZ curl clip and I don't use this I
don't really know how you would use it
but I mean if you want to try that you
totally can
so that's this one I really truly love
it like I said I did do this on second
day hair what you don't see in the
videos I did put a little bit dry
shampoo on my roots because I was
looking like I had a little bit of
greasy mess this morning
I also sprayed my guardian back to me
guardian angel hate protecting which
I'll show you in the video as well and
about Tara dry shampoo if you're
wondering that's the one I use so also
one more product in the video that
you're going to see is the got to be
powerful texture powder if you do watch
my videos you know that I use the
volumizing powder a lot so I decided to
pick up the texturizing one and I'll
show you how I apply it in the video
super easy just creates like nice
texture to your hair since we kind of
have like these waves going on so yep I
really love it it is kind of like a new
me Duke I don't have the new me one um
but this is definitely a cheaper version
that kind of sort of have the same kind
of barrel at least the same idea for it
and this is only $30 I got mine at
Walmart and my curls I do it on second
day here I did it through this past week
on second day hair and the curls lasted
so long and another thing is if you have
done my beachy wave tutorial you could
totally use this instead of using the
flat iron
so you'll kind of still have more of
that beachy wave look I'm gonna go ahead
and get on with the tutorial I hope you
guys enjoy this video and I will see you
on exist and I spray my hair with it got
to be guardian angel heat protectant and
I also brushed it out and parted it the
way that I wanted it to be parted so now
what we're gonna do is just go ahead and
start curling our hair I don't section
my hair I find that it's like way too
much time and I don't want to do that so
I just start doing
sections and of course I have like
flyaways up here but I'm gonna do so I'm
just going to start with my top and work
my way down so I take about this big of
a section I'm just going to wrap it
around the barrel like so hold it for
about maybe 5 6 seconds maybe I don't
know how long and just let it go and you
get this little wave now I'm gonna do
the front part again just a section
about that big push through it real
quick I'm gonna wrap it around the
barrel about five or six seconds let it
go then I'm gonna do back here about a
really thick section like that probably
about inch line sections I'd say and of
course I'm gonna wrap it around the
barrel now you want to make sure you
wrap it around the big barrels like the
big parts of it and the small parts I
don't really give you the wave effect if
you just wrap it around the little bitty
sections like little bitty indentions
then you'll just get more of like a
spiral curl you won't get like more of a
body wave so
you
I really love this iron because it gives
you so much volume and it's so easy to
do just wrap your hair around the barrel
it's just like the easiest thing in the
world I love it I love easy stuff and
sometimes when I start doing it I'll
roll the curling iron like away from my
face so I can really get near the root
so there's a little tip
let it go
I came out kind of funky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
