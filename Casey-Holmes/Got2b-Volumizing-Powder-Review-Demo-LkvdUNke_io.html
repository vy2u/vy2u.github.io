product review on a product I've really
been loving lately and it's the got to
be powerful volumizing styling powder so
it just looks like this and excuse my
nails I don't have to do them um but it
comes in a little box like so and the
front says new powder game-changer for
how you style and I'm really quickly
going to read the back description for
you and it says change the game of how
you style wood got to be powerful
volumizing styling powder and take your
volume to new heights join the powder
revolution with this innovative
weightless formula that texturizers your
hair to create maximum volume at the
roots apply anytime anywhere for instant
transformation
I completely agree with everything about
this product um I've had people ask me
they want to know if it leaves like a
white residue my hair personally it
isn't leave it in mine but I do have
more blonde hair on top I don't know
like for brunettes if it'll do that to
you but for me personally it doesn't and
when you rub it between your fingers um
I don't see any white residue on my hand
so I'm thinking probably not I do
already have it in my hair right now and
I don't know if you guys can tell but
literally my hair is usually not this
thick and let me just show you real
quick I will brush this part of my hair
back and like look at that volume right
there I don't know you guys probably
can't even understand because I have
like a pin straight hair it'll be flat
to my head but that's some volume it
definitely adds texture to my hair which
I do love I like my hair to feel kind of
more thick than anything I'm not huge on
like super volume eyes drew --tz-- and
you know like Snooki poof's like I can't
do those but I think this is in a very
great way to just kind of throw it in
your hair if you're feeling like hair's
a little flat or just has no shape to it
whatsoever don't get your boyfriend to
run his fingers through here because he
might get caught
in your hair but I like this better than
hairspray for teasing and stuff like
that because it feel like crunchy and
nasty and I just I'm not a huge fan of
hairspray I'll use it if I curl my hair
but I won't use it if I seriously don't
need it so really quickly I'm just going
to show you how I do it I do take my
jewelry off and stuff like that and I'm
just going to tap about that much in my
hands now you rub it together and you
like I said you can already feel it in
your hands and you just want to put it
in your roots like so and already have
this my hair and it's going to be like
completely weird feeling because I kind
of gives you that dirty kind of feel so
get the back a little bit
so you can kind of see I'm getting some
more volume on top and like I look crazy
right so what I'm going to do so that's
it for a couple seconds and I don't know
if I said this but you can also take
this bottle and if you want like extra
volume and you have like the guts to do
it you can tap this on your roots and
then rub it in with your fingers and it
gives even more volume but I don't want
to do that so what I'm going to do if
I'm going to brush over it real quickly
not brush like completely through it but
get these kind of flyaways down just so
I don't look like a complete crazy
person and that's that and then if you
want even more volume you can just take
like personally what I would do for
myself is take this layer bring it over
and take this part comb through it
comfort it come through it and I would
just kind of tease that part and this is
a connor teasing brush if you don't know
and it just gives like serious volume
like I can't even stress enough how good
this stuff is so then you can just bring
your hair over comb right over that
really quickly and
there you go extra volume don't need um
you know hairspray and stuff like that
for this I mean the volumizing powder
works so well it is insane so now I have
to tease the other side of my hair but
um you can see it just gives like extra
volume and it's like crazy I don't know
I don't get this volume naturally I
don't know about all you other girls you
might be really lucky and have it but I
personally don't so it's really cool to
me I don't have to use hairspray or
anything like that and it's super easy
I just want to sprinkle it rub it in and
go it's really great so I hope you guys
go and try this product out it's really
cool and definitely a different kind of
hair product pretty sure somebody told
me Bed Head had one as well I might try
that one out depends on the price I know
that this one's like eight or nine
dollars so it's super affordable that's
why I bought this but I'll have to go
check out the bed head see about that
one but yeah I hope you guys all enjoyed
this video and I will see you on the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
