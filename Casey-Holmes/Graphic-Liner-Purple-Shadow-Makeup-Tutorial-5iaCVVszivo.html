video is going to be a makeup tutorial
on this look right here I would just
like to inform you guys that is a 408 in
the morning Oh enough Sun mommy but it's
for a light in the morning and I wanted
to film a tutorial and I put on some Ed
Sheeran and I like got in this Zen this
whole makeup tutorial while filming it I
was just like I breathe and I enjoyed it
like I didn't know what I wanted to do
with my makeup look today I knew I just
wanted a graphic liner but for
eyeshadows and things like that I had no
idea what I wanted to do so I
experimented with some more of my BH
Cosmetics shadows because I have been
loving these shadows and especially the
baked ones these are very nice this dark
rose palette is a freaking pigmented
you're gonna see how pigmented this is
in the tutorial like it is insane so I
hope you guys enjoy this video it is a
little bit different a little bit more
colorful and then of course you have the
graphic liner so for you to just do a
regular winged liner or you can just do
a line up across the upper lash line and
be good to go but I want to kind of do
something a little bit different so I
really hope you guys enjoy this makeup
look please give it a thumbs up if you
do like it and I am sweating I'm hot and
I gotta wake up in three hours so I
think I'm gonna go now
thank you guys again so much for
watching and leave a comment down below
let me know what you want to see next
for videos and I will see you all in my
next one bye
so first I'm gonna use the its duty time
palette and I don't know why I showed
you this color actually is the one that
was right next to the cream shade on the
top row but I'm gonna take that shade
and put it directly into my crease and
blend it out I didn't have a nice matte
Brown in these other palettes so that is
why I dabbled into this one but you can
use whatever you have you can use a
bronzer anything you want so I was
having troubles figuring out what
palette I wanted to use so I just you
went with two different ones this one's
the wild child one and I'm gonna take
this white shade and
pink and I'm going to mix them together
and put this all over my lid now I'm
gonna put more of the white on the lid
just because I want it to be really nice
and bright and really open up the eyes
and then taking this dark rose palette
I'm going to take this magenta color
right here and we're gonna put this on
the outer half of the eye and blend it
in towards the white now you want to go
about half way you don't want to go any
further than that because you're gonna
want to blend it just so it goes from
white to the magenta and a nice blended
manner blended manner trying to get all
serious here no just make sure you blend
it and then I'm gonna take this
chocolate brown shade it actually has a
hint of purple in it it's very very
gorgeous and I'm gonna put this directly
into the crease and just a little bit
above it this is kind of gonna be our
guideline for our purple we're gonna put
on in just a minute but you want to put
this like I said directly into the
crease a little above and also kind of
flick it out towards the outer edge so
it kind of gives a winged effect
so you can see what I did there where I
just put a little bit more shadow on the
outer corner and kind of winged it out
and drugged it back into the crease
and then I'm going to take that magenta
shade and just touch it up right here in
the outer half
and then taking this darker purple with
some shimmer this shimmer didn't show up
really that bad on the eyes it actually
just looked like a really nice deep
purple but I'm gonna put this directly
below that Brown that we just put on and
we're gonna follow that same pattern but
just a little bit below it so you can
still see that darker Brown and then the
darker purple going to the magenta and
then to the white it's just kind of like
a fading effect that we're doing here
and then I'm gonna take the tape off and
then this is the part that's gonna be
time-consuming but it's just depending
on what you want to do since I did a
graphic liner it took it definitely took
a little bit more time so I'm taking a
BH Cosmetics gel liner that I mentioned
in my favourites video I love it it's
super black and matte so basically what
you're doing with this is making a
winged liner and then also dragging a
little bit more into the crease so you
have your winged eyeliner down and then
you also have the liner going up into
the crease so it just kind of gives a
dramatic graphic effect I really like
the way it looks it kind of gives a
Barbie doll effect in a way to your eyes
it just really makes some sultry and
sexy and I really really like it I think
it's actually super fun
so now I'm taking these will lower
lashes and grow you crazy I put those on
and of course my regular primers and
foundations and I'm using this BH
Cosmetics brush that I love I've
mentioned it before it's amazing and I
believe they're having a sale on these
right now
so I will link that down below for you
guys then of course I'm doing my regular
concealer routine I will leave my
concealers that I use down below and the
same patter that I always use I figured
I would just go ahead and skip over this
step because I've shown you guys this a
bajillion gazillion times
taking the Smashbox bronzer and suntan
matte in this two-faced brush I'm just
going to go ahead and bronze up the skin
this bronzer is gorge I love it oh my
gosh it's so beautiful so I just warm up
the face with that and then I'm taking
this forever nude palette this is a new
favorite this was my first time using it
and you're gonna see my reaction right
after I use it it is so amazing this
bronzer that I'm using in the palette
has an Ashley undertone to it so it
gives it a nice natural looking shadow
oh it's so gorgeous look at it see
perfect I loved it and then see this is
how unprepared I was for this video I
had to search for everything as I was
going along but this is a NARS blush in
deucer and I love this blush with this
look it just goes so beautifully
then for highlighter I'm going to take a
Cielo eyeshadow in the shade it in they
also have this in like a little
highlighting duo set if you want it and
I'm sorry if you can hear my dogs
they're playing they're absolutely
insane and then filling in my brows with
my same brow product I've been using
lately and then what we're gonna do is
highlight underneath the brow bone with
that matte cream shade in the its duty
time palette I didn't want to use a
shimmery shade just because we already
had so much going on with the lids in
the liner I don't want to have a
shimmery highlight as well and now I'm
taking this buxom liner in black and I'm
just going to line my lower lash line
and then we're going to take that darker
shade we put right below the deep
chocolate brown and we're going to line
our lower lash line with this I forgot
to do another clip of that but that's
the color I'm using right here and then
to blend that out we'll be using the
magenta shade that we used on the outer
half of the lid
then you want to plan your lower mascara
this is the Clinique bottom lash
favorite favorite mascara ever it's
beautiful and I love it and then moving
on to lips you're gonna see how much of
a hot mess this was because I couldn't
get it together y'all I just couldn't
figure out what kind of lip color I
wanted so I'm taking this Lancome lip
liner in nude tan I'm just going to fill
in my lips with this I always go with
like a nude shade if I don't really know
what color I'm gonna use and then I went
in with this NARS lipstick and Anna and
this is a really pretty
mafia pink and I loved it but it was
just too much for this look it made it
look a little too colorful for me so I
went back in with Anita which is a
little bit lighter than the shade and
you could see me take it to the home so
when it would Anita I wasn't happy still
I wanted it a little bit lighter so then
I went in with a nude lipstick you can
use whatever nude you have and put this
right over top and it just lightened it
up and then pulled it all together and I
ended up loving the lip combo I'm sorry
there were so many lip combos but that's
just what happened so I hope you guys
enjoyed this makeup look thank you is so
much for watching and give it a thumbs
up if you liked it and I'll see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
