video because I did this full makeup
look using a drugstore makeup products
now the brushes aren't all drugstore I
did use some morphe brushes which are
affordable all of the makeup products
are drugstore and what really made me
want to do this is I was in Ulta
yesterday and I went in to get a serum
and of course I came out with more than
a serum so I saw these new and NYX Avant
pop palettes and I was intrigued I was
like oh my god this looks like Inglot
palettes does not like the size of these
eyeshadows just look they screamed a lot
to me I didn't test them out or anything
in store I was just like let's wing it
let's buy - let's see what we can work
with so of course I got this more
neutral one and then I also got this one
that's a little more cool tone and has
some fun colors in it so of course I
wanted to play with this one and this is
just look that I came up with I really
hope you guys enjoy it I know you guys
love drugstore products I did post a
picture of another drugstore makeup look
I did not too long ago which you guys
will be seeing within the next week or
two you'll be seeing it I promise but
yeah I just really love this look I
think it's fun and yeah I hope you guys
I hope I didn't just break the pallet I
didn't break it this one's called ooh no
Eva chic that's this one that I use
today and then this one is surreal my
heart I feel like I'm not saying that
right
sory oh my heart it just sounds weird if
you want to see a tutorial with this one
like this video or just like it if you
like it and I will do that for you guys
leave a comment down below letting me
know if you've tried these out if not if
you're looking forward to trying them
out and yeah let's just go ahead and get
started with the video okay so we're
gonna go ahead and take this next
palette I already forgot what the name
is called but we're just gonna go with
it so I'm gonna take that shader I just
showed you and we're gonna put this all
into the crease on the lid this is going
to be our transition shade
it's nice and light but it's not too
light it's the perfect transition shade
for all these colors we're gonna be
using then we're gonna take this
chocolate brown and we're gonna use the
pencil brush and we're first going to
really deepen up this crease it's kind
of like a cut crease but not as precise
you just really want to put quite a bit
of product into the crease and for me
I'm going a little bit above the crease
as well to make my lids look a little
bit larger how many times can i say
crease how many like I don't know maybe
thousand I have no idea but you just
want to go ahead and build this color up
and then we are going to start working
this into the inner corner and also the
outer corner so right here I'm putting a
little bit in the outer corner and then
also right here in the inner corner this
is gonna look messy at first but just
just keep going I promise it's gonna
look fine it all looks a little messy at
first I feel like but it'll work out I
promise so then after you've applied
that product we're going to take a clean
blending brush and we're just going to
blend just so we don't have any harsh
lines and nothing looks jagged and crazy
so just keep in mind blending is your
best friend and also the tape on your
eye is one of your best friends - at
least for me it makes cleanup so much
easier and gives me a nice sharp line
every single time I've explained why I
do it like a million times but if you
don't know why just go check out a
couple of videos back I explained it in
that
moving on I'm gonna take this olive
green color and we're going to place
this all over the lid and I went in one
time with this one right here all I'm
doing is just blending it out with this
shadow brush and I'm telling you it goes
such a long way this palette is so
pigmented look how beautiful it is I
can't so you shouldn't pack this all
over the lid and take it up to the
crease area where we have that brown
don't be afraid to take it over the
brown oh that's on the inner and outer
corner it's totally fine
the brown underneath is just gonna add a
little bit more definition a little bit
more dimension and smoke it out a bit so
you're gonna do the same exact thing for
the other eye and then what we're gonna
do after that is we're going to take the
light kind of shimmery champagne ish
bronze shade in here which is that one
right there a little bit darker in
person and we're gonna flip that brush
over and just put this on the center of
the lid you can just tell the difference
between my right eye from where I'm
sitting my right eye and the left eye
that I'm working on I mean it's just
such a difference it brings the eye look
to life it looks so beautiful I
absolutely adore this color I can't wait
to do a lighter look with this palette
because this color will be going all
over the lid it's stunning
so like I said earlier it just brings a
lot of life to this look and you just
want to blend it out with the same brush
that you've been using and then we're
gonna take a blending brush in the very
first shade we use and just go in and
blend even more
then we're going to take this Brown
again and a short kind of more dense
brush this one's from Mac you can use
whatever one you have and I'm just going
to put more of that brown in the outer
corner and then drag the excess into the
crease just to make sure we don't lose
too much of the intensity that we had
put on the outer corner and into the
crease so again
pack it on the outer half and blend it
in the crease then you take the tape off
and your cleanup is done and then we're
taking this NYX gel liner and I did a
wings aligner which took me a hot minute
because it's been a minute since I've
done winged liner but let me tell you
I've missed it so much and this is the
blackest gel liner ever like I'm just so
obsessed with it then I'm applying Coco
lashes in goddess because they're just
in set up session that I have and then
taking my number seven immediately Matt
primer I went ahead and applied that and
then we're taking the Loreal Pro matte
foundation and fresh beige and putting
that on with a Beauty Blender and I like
this foundation it looks a little off
right now
it looks good after we're complete so
just to bear with me so we're gonna take
this nyx concealer which is too light
for me so but it magically ends up
working out that's just the magic of
blending and makeup it's just somehow
works I don't know how but it does so
I'm going to put this in all the areas
that I usually do which is underneath my
eyes in a triangle shape or upside down
triangle whatever you want to call it
Center my face and on my nose and then
I'm just gonna take my Beauty Blender
and blend it out I'm gonna take the
pointed edge and blend out most of my
concealer and then flip the sponge
around to where I was putting foundation
on with it and have it help blend even
more so if you just cut if you're using
a brush you can use a sponge to blend in
and then take your brush to blend out
the edges just so it goes in seamlessly
with the rest of your foundation then
I'm taking this BH Cosmetics contour and
blush palette I believe it was called
and I'm taking the two lightest shades
and setting my concealer with it there's
literally a white shade in here and I
don't want to set my under eyes with a
white shade so I made sure to mix it
with a skintone color and I didn't
realize that I had one non drugstore
product but this is not very high-end
it's not that pricy but it's a really
good bronzer
it's from the Sephora brand I think it's
like
14 15 bucks I mean that's pretty much
how much everything is in the drugstore
anyways but I'm gonna bronze my face
with it and I love it and then the one
back into that BH Cosmetics palette and
taking the darkest shade and contouring
with it be very careful with this color
because if you do too much it will look
crazy but I love it if you just start
out light and build it up and it's such
a beautiful beautiful contour and I
really do love this palette I think it's
an all-around great palette I just wish
that it had a better bronzer in it to be
quite honest with you and then I turned
my vanity girl mirror lights down and
look we kind of have like regular
lighting now is that crazy
and then I turned it back on now going
in with this shade and this is like my
favorite blush color ever it is so
beautiful so pigmented and it goes with
the look so well I just I absolutely
adore it so I'm gonna apply that and
then again blend out with a morphe brush
and I just I'm obsessed I love it
after that I wanted to improvise and use
a highlighter from the palette so I'm
going to take the shimmery shade and
then the matte shade and we're going to
apply this on the tops of the cheekbones
and I just winged it and I ended up
really liking it the way that it turned
out cuz the lightest shade to really
help lighten it up and let me just say
isn't it funny how I just tap my fingers
like it was a brush isn't that that's
like have it I don't know why but it's
habit and I'm taking the next eyebrow
gel and I'm just gonna go ahead and fill
those in right before your eyes and then
I'm gonna take these two light shades
again I mainly took the matte shade at
the end of this just because the matte
shade really showed up a lot better than
the shimmer shade and just looked better
with the look in my personal opinion so
I just applied the matte one underneath
my brows to lift them and then I did
take this shimmery one and put it in the
inner corners of the eyes just to
brighten it up a little bit taking this
Rimmel nude liner I love this I've been
using it for so long I'm gonna put this
in my waterline and I love it because it
really opens up the eyes and doesn't
like drowned you in the dark makeup you
know what I mean
a nude eyeliner is so perfect for looks
like this just to make sure you look
awake but still smoke things out then
I'm gonna take that chocolate brown
color again and a flat shader brush and
we're just gonna press this up against
the lower lash line this is just going
to add definition and really bring the
whole entire look together once we blend
it out so I did pile this color on a
quite a bit because once you start
blending it blends out most of it so I'm
gonna do that for both eyes and then I'm
taking the very first shade that we used
in this whole tutorial which we used in
our crease and I'm using a pencil brush
just to blend that line out
then I'm gonna take my favorite mascara
from the drugstore and it's the l'oreal
miss manga and i'm gonna use it for my
bottom lashes today because it really
does separate very very well and doesn't
make them look spidery or anything like
that and then we're using one thing for
our lips and i love these i forgot to
use them and I forgot to mention them in
my favorites video but I love these NYX
nude like crayon lip things I mean
they're amazing I don't know what color
this is but I'll leave it down below I
love it they dry matte and they last a
really long time so I highly recommend
them and I like the fact that they're in
a pencil form so you don't have to have
a lip liner and everything else on top
it's just this and you're done and
that's it for this tutorial guys I hope
you enjoyed it please share it if you
liked it and don't forget to thumbs up
and subscribe and I'll see you all in my
next video bye now rose like all that
give to the poles there's a little desk
right there that I really like but I
don't like the antique look of it like I
want it to be a clean white table so I
really want to be teabag like I like
