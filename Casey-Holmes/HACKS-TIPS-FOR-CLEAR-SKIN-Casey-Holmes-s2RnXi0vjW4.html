tips and hacks to get clear skin so I
hope you guys enjoy this and let's just
get started
so the first thing that you can do is
actually steam your face all I'm going
to do is take a bowl of water and I'm
going to place that in the microwave for
about 5 minutes and what you're going to
do is you're going to take a bowl to the
table with a towel and put the towel of
your head and the bowl and let the steam
hit you in the face and this is going to
help remove dirt dusts and oils from
your pores and it's not going to
aggravate any pimples that you might
already have so this next one is using
honey as a mask I show you which one I
use in this video but I'm just taking a
old makeup brush and using that to apply
it and what the honey will do is it
moisturizes your skin and it's not
irritating so it'll also help soothe
your skin and reduce irritation so for
me having rosacea this is a great way to
moisturize the skin and have it not be
irritated and it's also really easy to
take off okay so the next thing you want
to do is cleanse your skin every night
this is really really important and I've
actually been trying out this Clarisonic
Mia fit and I was actually really
nervous to try this just because I do
have rosacea and sensitive skin but this
is great it has a really gentle setting
on it which is the first setting and it
has really soft bristles which I love
and also like back and forth so it's
going to really deep clean and penetrate
that skin and get all that gunk and dirt
out I've noticed a huge difference in
the way my skin looks and also the
texture the texture is so much softer so
if you've been debating on this product
I would definitely go for it I give it a
two thumbs up and it is great for travel
as well I love the sides of it so all
you want to do is just make sure you
cleanse your skin every night and pat
dry
this is really
really really going to help with clear
skin this is like one of the biggest
things now this trick I've used for
years then is to use toothpaste as spot
treatment so if you run out of the spot
treatment you can always go to your
handy-dandy toothpaste I've just used
this toothpaste for ever I've also used
crest before and just put it on your
problem areas I like to go to sleep and
like let it dry up and then the morning
wash off and your pimple won't be
completely gone but it will be reduced
so hey inexpensive way right next will
be to use poor strips or anything that
will really get out those blackheads and
anything that's just stuck in your pores
I'm actually going to show you a DIY
because I saw this on Pinterest and I
was like no way this doesn't work so I
tried it on camera and it actually does
work so I use an organic egg white I
just use one of them and I whisked it up
a little bit with a fork and then I'm
applying it to my face with this
foundation brush Pinterest said to use a
paper towel but I'm going to use a
little piece of toilet paper and I'm
just going to put that on top of the egg
white and then when I have that place
where I want I'm going to put the egg
white on top of it again just to kind of
like seal it all in place and then what
you're going to do is just let that dry
and you will feel it it will just
tighten up your pores and then you just
want to gently take it off it doesn't
hurt at all like the other store poor
strips and it actually took everything
off you couldn't see it but I promise
you it worked
last but not least is to moisturize this
is really important I'm always telling
my friends and family to moisturize but
what you want to do is just put this all
over your face and you want to just make
sure your skin is hydrated and balanced
having dry your skin is more prone to
aging so just moisturize get a good one
put it all over your face all over your
neck don't forget your neck your neck is
just as important as your face okay guys
so that is it I really hope you enjoyed
this video if you did don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe and I
will see you all in my next one bye
