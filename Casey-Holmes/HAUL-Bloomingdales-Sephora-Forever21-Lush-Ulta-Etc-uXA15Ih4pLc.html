haul video I went shopping Wednesday at
Lenox Mall which is in Atlanta it's one
of my all-time favorite malls ever it
just has stuff ranging from high-end
like really high-end like Prada to
forever 21 I mean it just ranges in that
mall it is just one of my all-time
favorites so if you're ever in Atlanta
definitely felt like Lenox Mall but this
side of my hair is just bothering me
today it's just I know you guys are a
lot of you like calls so I figured I
just go ahead and show you so I'm gonna
go ahead and get started the first place
that wasn't Linux that we went to is
Ulta and I just got a couple things the
main reason I went was to get this Sally
Hansen nail polish in Pacific Blue and
my friend Taylor who actually went
shopping with hi Taylor
if you're watching she was wearing this
on her nails and I fell in love with it
it was just the most gorgeous blue ever
like literally ever and if you're
wondering about my nails this is what
they look like a posted picture on
Instagram a couple times I put the
tutorial that I use down below and I put
the colors down below as well so you can
check that out but this is like going on
my nails as soon as possible I love it
then I just got two little concealers I
got the erase paste in number two medium
these are just like the little samples
they have at the checkout line so just a
little mini of that and then I also got
the benefit boying and lemonade duo this
is only $12 and I think it's a medium it
doesn't say but not that dark but it's a
cute little package like this and you
have the lemonade and the Boyne
concealer and the boy concealers like
your basic concealer and the lemonade
one is for your legs like if you have
veins or anything like that which I
don't have like a problem with but I
know some people do so they have that on
there um alright so when we went to
Linux the first place we went to was
Bloomingdale's and I had actually I
never been in a Bloomingdale's before I
loved it it's like a whole nother world
it's just I don't know my favorite place
now but
we went to the section that was the
brand All Saints they have such cute
stuff totally on my alley
these holes are meant to be here if
you're wondering I know some people are
gonna be like you have holes in your
shirt I'll show you guys that when I get
to it but we went to All Saints and we
were looking at this one jacket
it's like a $400 leather jacket but it
is beyond beautiful but I don't know if
I could spend 400 all hearts on the
jacket but it is quartz we were just
like drooling over it pretty much and I
came across this shirt and fell in love
with it
so it's supposed to be really really big
so that's it's in a size 4 I didn't
really know how to like determine my
size with the size 4 sticks and stuff so
I just picked this one which was a 4 and
I tried it on I liked it so it is bigger
and as you can see it has a heart with
two skulls in it and it just hangs off
my shoulder really nicely it's super
comfortable and its really soft material
so I like that and then we went by the
Chanel counter and I've been eyeing this
for so long and I finally was just like
just freaking pick it up so I picked it
up I don't know what color I got but
they'll usually match you to your color
when you go and it's the so light and a
Chanel bronzer I have used it a couple
times and I'm obsessed with it so it
looks like this it's kind of like a
cream bronzer it's not orange at all it
is so just beautiful um a lot of people
have told me that it's a very natural
looking browser which it is but you can
totally see the definition in your face
like it's just it's gorgeous so super
happy I picked that up okay let's get
makeup by the way um next place I'm
going to talk about is Sephora and I've
got a couple things there so I did a few
samples of the matte velvet plus
foundation I'm actually wearing a number
40 right now and I really really really
like it and I also got this kat von d
palette it's in little sinner it is the
most gorgeous palette ever so of course
it has that matte black packaging that
she always has and oh I just like almost
dug my finger in there but these are the
colors they are just so beautiful and
with Kat Von D shadows you seriously
don't
to worry about pigmentation like I
didn't even swatch these in the store
because I knew they were just gonna be
amazing and they are I mean they're just
beautiful beautiful beautiful colors so
I'm super happy about this palette okay
next I got this Bobbi Brown corrector in
dark peach which I will be returning
because it's just not my color I don't
know what the heck happened but that's
how dark it is like look at that that's
not gonna work I don't know how that
happened but I don't know if should pick
the wrong color or something but I'm
gonna have to return that and I think
I'm just going to use the credit for
this towards the makeup forever matte
velvet plus because I'm obsessed with
this foundation and I also got this
makeup forever full cover concealer I
hear a missglamorazzi talk about this
all the time so I finally just like had
to splurge and pick it up and I'm a
number 10 and it says that this is
waterproof so that's pretty cool and I
just I love makeup forever and I figured
if Ingrid loved it I would love it so I
tried it and so far I'm really liking it
I have applied it a couple of days or I
have applied a couple times and I really
like it is definitely full coverage and
then I feel like I got something else no
that's enough and then the last thing I
got was this Make Up For Ever HD powder
I've never tried this before but I've
heard so many great things about it I
got to set the little checkout line you
know how they have all the little
miscellaneous stuff this was only 15
dollars and you get five grams which I
thought was a great deal um you guys
know I love my ELF High Definition
powder but I really wanted to try
something more high-end and kind of see
if there was like a difference or
something but I'm really excited to try
that in for only $15 I mean that's not
bad if you follow me on Twitter you're
also curious about what happened at lush
like I said it's not a big deal but it
kinda just put a bad taste in my mouth
pretty much I bought a powder there that
was twenty dollars and I live an hour
away from Linux so it's not like I can
just get up and go if something's not in
my bag long story short got home powders
not in my bag
everything else is and I call up there
which was a hassle because it's so hard
to get to them for some reason I don't
understand why
and basically the girl was like giggling
the whole time like pretty much the kind
of thought it was funny and I wasn't
like being rude but I was very annoyed
and personally whenever I'm mad like the
last thing I want somebody to do is
giggle because that just like triggers
something I made the main problem I had
was I didn't even get a saree or
anything and be from being in customer
service myself every day and in the past
like my whole job experiences customer
service I've always apologized for you
know everything that's just how you keep
your customers happy and that's just how
you keep that business I mean you kind
of have to give and take a little bit
the fact that she was a sari was kind of
like really really I should be getting
that powder Monday so we'll see but I
got four back products and a sample so
I'm going to show you guys I have no
idea what they're called so yeah I
really need to figure out what this one
is because I didn't read the thing I
just smelt it and picked it up but it
looks like this and it reminds me of
like a popsicle I used to eat when I was
a child
oh it smells so good but it's like
really greasy so if you know what that
is let me know I think it's like a back
milk but I'm not positive
and I got three back bones this one's
like a vanilla bath bomb oh it smells
really really good and then this one is
sex bomb I've heard about this one a lot
so that's what that looks like and then
the last one I gots like a honey one um
looks like a bee and it smells like
honey on them this one smells really
good this one I don't know that's
probably my favorite and then first
sample I got the rose argon rose Argan
body conditioner and I'm not a huge fan
of the smell but if it works I can
handle it okay so the next place we went
to was Urban Outfitters and I just got
one thing I just I kind of feel like
urban outfitters it's so expensive and I
just really don't want to pay the prices
that they won't be to pay but we walked
in their little cell wreck and I saw
this cute crossbody bag so
just has this the studs and just like
this rope detail with all this cute
little stunt detail at the top really
adorable bag it's actually a pretty
decent size and it has a zipper in it
which I really like this was originally
39 they had it on sale for 20 and then I
found out at the checkout that they were
having an extra 30 percent off sale
items so I got this for $15 which I
thought like was a steal because it is
such great quality next place is what
seal and I just saw a couple things and
they're just story items so these two
were on sale for $2.99 each but they
were violent going for a penny all right
and they're originally 550 so they're
just like little skull bracelets and the
bottom one is like all gold I don't know
if you guys can see but I have one
that's like this that's kind of
multicolored and then I have this one
that's all gold I don't know if it's
focusing or not it's probably not but
they're really cute then I just got two
rings for violin get one half off and I
got this really cute like staple ring I
thought it's adorable I really really
like it so pick that up and then I got
this because you guys know I love skulls
it's nothing new um and it's a really
pretty ring it has like little
rhinestones on it and I just like fell
in love with it it's so cute I loved it
well I think I went to is forever 21 and
I just got a few things I'll show you
the most boring part I got new um more
basics
I had white cream tan and black because
these are literally dirt cheap and then
I got the shirt that I'm wearing now and
it is supposed to have holes in it like
I said so it just has like the little
holes right here it says born reckless
and I actually got it in a medium still
be really loose and you can see it has
like little like cutouts right there I
don't think it has any on the back no
but I like it as like cute little shirt
just throw on and then the other shirt
that I got was this one it's a crochet
top and it's really really pretty
it's in a small medium and
looks like this hair on it okay really
really cute it has this scoop in the
front and the scoop in the back and I
really liked it looks cute especially
with the Goethe cream little undershirt
it looks at the whirlpool so I got this
bag and it's adorable it has just like
the gold studs as you can tell and it
has like a little shoulder strap which I
think would be kind of cute but I'm more
into the cross bodies right now so
that's what I'll use is a longer strap
and what I love about this is is zips at
the top and you can lift it up unzip
they get all your stuff and then just
fold it back down so everything's like
super secure and you have a ton of room
like my wallet will fit in there make up
a lot of stuff is gonna fit in here so I
really liked this and I felt like the
quality was really nice for a forever 21
then for jewelry items I just got three
things I got this little wrap bracelet
it's just white I don't have a wrap
bracelet and I really wanted one so I
just decided to pick this one up
umm I also got these pair of studs I
thought they were super pretty and kind
of just like right on my alley
then I got this which is my favorite
it's like this really cute extended
pyramid type bracelet it is just
adorable I love it I love it I love it I
think it's just so edgy like you have
the really nice does on side you have
like the ones with the rhinestones and
it's just so gorgeous so that is all I
got when I went shopping at Linux on
Wednesday I hope you guys enjoyed it I
can't wait to try a lot of the makeup
stuff out and let you guys know what I
think and I will see you all in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
