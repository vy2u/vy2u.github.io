haul I purchased quite a bit of stuff
the past couple days and I really wanted
to show you what I got so I'm gonna go
ahead and get started the first thing I
went to a Walmart and I just seemed like
a couple repurchases the first thing
actually is right here it's the ponds
wet cleansing towelettes this comes with
30 and I actually really like these a
lot they don't sting my eyes or anything
like that and they're just another
really great so I've been using those a
lot and then I repurchased this John
Frieda Frizz Ease heat defeat protective
styling spray I like to use this near my
roots because it doesn't make my hair
oily or anything like that and it still
gives you that heat protection that you
really need so I like this as well I saw
these at Walmart and I had to get them I
haven't seen them anywhere and then I
finally saw in there and I was like okay
I have to be at least like a couple so I
got the sat fire siren 360 and it's just
a gorgeous like royal blue it's just so
so pretty and then I got green with envy
320 and I've heard a lot of great things
about this polish as well so I decided
to pick these up and then I also got
this little heart candy lip balm
chapstick thing and it's in Bridal blush
now I did try this out I got it
yesterday and I decided just to open it
up and I'm kind of disappointed in it
it's really great I love the color
payoff it gives my lips but the product
itself is like so flimsy and like I had
probably about an inch sticking out and
it didn't retract back into the balm it
just kind of stuck out which is one like
awful I hate that but yeah so I went to
put on my lips I didn't even press down
hard and it broke off so that sucked so
that's so much product I have left now I
mean it's only three dollars and I do
like it so I will be repurchasing it but
they kind of needed to step up their
game on their lip products you would
think at least the next one I went to
was Walgreens and the main reason why I
went here to get was to get um these two
lipsticks I followed cowbell XO which is
Meg I follow her on Instagram and um I
saw her push the picture of these and
she was like this is a dupe for Hugh so
I was
like ooh I want to go get so I went got
them they were have a sticker in them of
Christ eyes 649 apiece and I'm gonna put
the name right here because it's I don't
know I can't say the last part but they
only had two at my Walgreens on display
so I picked them both up I decided to
have when I was a backup in case I
really liked it okay that one I ever
swatch um but this one is like I don't
know it's the perfect like nude pink
color
I think Revlon soft nudes the best nude
at the drugstore like no shimmer nothing
like that - the perfect nude and this is
the perfect pinky nude I just absolutely
love this for a drugstore product and I
do have to agree with Meg when she says
it's similar to hue because it really
really really is like the consistency
and all that it's kind of different but
at the same time they still kind of have
that glaze that the Mac does so those
are those - this one's the Mac one and
this one's the Maybelline one I don't
know if you can really tell but they are
pretty similar so I recommend you go
checking these out because I do think
they're limited edition so pick that up
and then Tresemme was having buy two for
seven or something like that and I got
the Tresemme Salon silk no frizz serum
with argan oil I guess this is new I
don't know but - I'd pick it up it kind
of has the consistency of the coconut
milk kinda like that watery gel look but
I want to try it mainly because it said
it had argan oil in it so I did pick
that up drop in and then I also picked
up this I've heard somebody talk about
this I don't remember who it was but
somebody has talked about this and they
liked it a lot so it's the Tresemme
nourishing rituals rejuvenating mud mask
I'm excited to try this out I want to
get the macadamia one but I'm just too
lazy to go to Target or anything like
that but it smells really really good so
I'm excited to see what I think of this
and it was only two to seven so why not
right and usually I never purchase
I see but I was so drawn to this color I
like had to have it this is called
bikini so teeny and it is what I have on
my ring fingers or my accent fingers and
the last dress our place I went to or
Friday they were having really good
sales on Revlon and then I just ended up
picking different stuff too so first
thing was the Nexus ultra moisture
shampoo and conditioner I wanted to get
little samples of these and try it out
before I actually bought the full size
because they are pretty pricey so I did
get those and then I also picked up
another okay its other packaging I
picked up another NYC little liquid
liner you guys know I love this stuff
and I just wanted to repurchase it just
to kind of have the backup and I also
purchased this big sexy hair powder play
it's just a volumizing powder I've heard
really good things about this so I was
excited to finally find it because I
swear to you I've been looking for it
everywhere couldn't find it so I finally
got it at a ride a guys know I love my
following rising powders and then I
picked up three Julie G nail polishes I
am in love with these polishes I will be
like purchasing all of them there are
only four dollars a piece and they're
actually pretty great quality this is
only two coats if you can tell and what
I have on my nails is actually her nail
polish and bikini then I also have
fierce and fab and oh em gee I just
think these are so girly and so pretty
and she did a really really really great
job on the formula the colors and the
packaging I really love these polishes
and then the last things are Revlon I
just bought five things they didn't have
really like a ton of stuff I wanted I
did pick up a nail lacquer these were
only $2.99 a piece and this is the only
one that I really wanted so this is in
flirt just a really pretty like lilac
pink color I picked up two of my
favorite concealers if you haven't seen
my everyday face routine
you should I'll link it right here but
my concealer that I use which is this is
in that video they didn't have medium
they're actually out but I picked up
the color up which is medium deep so I
was excited to purchase these and they
were only 250 apiece which is a freaking
steal these things are originally $10 so
I was so excited to pick these two up I
had to get two instead of one because
that's just I don't know when you find
good deals you need to pick up two you
know what I mean I don't know maybe
that's just me and then I picked up the
Revlon Colorstay eyeliner usually I
don't use these kind of eyeliners on my
waterline but I've heard really great
things about this so I decided to pick
it up and then the next thing is this
Revlon Colorstay cream gel liner I
haven't really heard much about this but
I've been eyeing it for a while so I
really wanted to try it out and of
course I just got this in black I just
never wanted to pay the full price of it
so I waited till it went on sale okay so
I did order something online and it was
from Sedona lace you guys know I love my
Sedonas vortex brushes so I decided to
purchase another set from them and this
is actually the 12 piece professional
makeup brushes and I got a free little
sample pack last time because it was a
promo and then they were so nice and
just decided to send it to me again
because the permit isn't going on
anymore but they sent me another one so
I was really excited about that and if
you didn't see that little haul I'll
quickly show you what it is you
basically just get three eyeshadows
which you get like a little pink one a
blue one and then this one was actually
at my may favorites and it's like a dark
burgundy brown kind of color and then
you also get a travel size EB 13 and you
get D full-size of this in the vortex
brushes so I really like that now so
nest them send me another one and the
first set like I said I did purchase
these all myself so these brushes come
with a really nice you know travel case
for your brushes when do you call them I
hide the name in my head and I usually
lost it
a brush roll and I think it's a brush
roll right who cares
but anyway so it's really really nice
actually pretty durable I'm not going to
be keeping them in these because I like
to have my brushes out where I can see
them but this is pretty much the set it
just has your nice basic eyeshadows I
think this is a great starter kit if
you're just starting out with makeup and
you don't know what bro
just to get or what breasts set to get
if you're looking for a complete set I
totally recommend these because it has
every brush you need just start out and
I'm really excited to try these out and
see what I think of them I will be doing
a couple videos on brushes so just keep
an eye out for that but I really love
them they were only $60 so I thought
that was a great deal okay so the next
thing I went to was Kohl's please excuse
the dogs barking because they're playing
but I went to Kohl's and I just
purchased two shirts the first shirt I
got was this really pretty like
turquoise shirt it has like the ruffles
and stuff it's so pretty and it just has
a plain back
I love tops that come up to my neck and
kind of go behind I just think they're
so pretty and flattering um I got this
in a size small and it was $38 and I got
mine for 15/20 I thought that was a
really great deal and then I also got
this I'm really loving like this little
summer sweater type shirts and I think
they're so pretty so I picked up this
one they had another one in like a neon
yellow green kind of color and they only
had it in an extra small and a medium
medium was too big and extra small was
too small so I found this one this
wasn't as small it was originally $42
and I actually got this for $15 as well
so I thought that was a great deal it is
from the candies brand so it's just like
I like that knit stores sweater like a
really really really loose kind of knit
and it has these little buttons on the
back which I thought was so cute but
this just fits perfectly did like hang
off the shoulder and it'd be really cute
with just like a little tank top
underneath it just something to throw on
and go so I really really like this and
it kind of has like a metallic threading
to it as well so I did pick that I went
to forever 21 I did get this top from
there it was only 480 so I did pick up
this one I also got it in black like
that and I also got it in a white which
I wore in an outfit of the day so it's
dirty right now so the next tank top I
got just another casualty I don't really
have a lot of casual stuff so I'm kind
of trying to buy
more of that so it's kind of like a
short white tank top and it has like I
guess you could call it like Indian kind
of detail I don't know I got it in a
size small it fits really loose and nice
I really like it and this was only 13 18
so I really liked this it was cute on
then the next tank top I got I really
liked it I actually got an extra small
and it's still really big so it's a big
tank top but it's really pretty on I got
it for 1580 it's just like a kind of
nice nude tank top and on the side it
has like this netting right here it's so
nice
super comfortable really lightweight and
it looks really really cute with the
white shorts I had on so that's more
than likely what I'll be pairing this
with but I love it because it's just so
loose and light and like flowy it just
worked perfectly okay next this was an
outfit of the day but I figured I'd show
you guys it was washed out and the
outfit of the day but I really love it
it's just like a pastel yellow Jean vest
I absolutely love this little vest I
don't think it's gonna show true to
color as well on here either no I'll
take a picture and I'll insert it right
here
but this was only like 20 to 80 I really
like it got in a size medium it is so
freakin cute I love it for summer it
doesn't make me like too hot or anything
like that it's just nice to kind of
spice up any outfit with a little Jean
vest so I really really really like this
I've always wanted like I am jean jacket
but down here it is way too hot to be
wearing a jean jacket in the summertime
so I figured a Jean vest was another way
to go I hope I can find these in more
colors because I really really like them
I think they're cute faces the last time
I got from forever 21 I got really
overwhelmed in that store I just felt
like I couldn't really look around I
just felt so I don't know like I said
overwhelmed and I just didn't know what
I wear to get but I got this in size
medium in this 680 I liked it because
it's just a basic top it's a tank top
and it ties at the bottom I love that I
thought it was so cute just to kind of
tie at the bottom and I don't know I
like that look I think it's really
really cute and then the last thing I
got word I was gonna buy jewelry but
like I said I was already overwhelmed
and I was ready to check out so I saw
these like this checkout line and
they're just little eyeshadows and
they're only a dollar eighty apiece and
I wanted to try them out because I've
heard great things about their nail
polishes and their makeup but I really
wanted to try these shadows and if
they're they're only dollar eighty s
that they suck I mean they suck this is
the only one I took out but I guess I
should probably take out all of them so
you can see don't run my nail polish so
open them with tweezers if you don't
know in your nail polish but okay so
bula first one I got this is just in
beige and it's actually a pretty huge
single eyeshadow but it's a really
really pretty color and it has a decent
amount of color payoff so I'm excited to
try these out and see what I think that
of course is a beige so it's not gonna
be like a BAM in your face but it's
really nice and then I got dark brown
olive which just looks like this I got
basic colors we got you guys know I love
my neutrals so that's that that's the
color payoff on that one I mean they're
really really
really pigmented I just will have to see
the lasting power and stuff but that's
that one and then I got this black
silver which just which just looks like
this just your basic black silver color
kind of looks a little bit um Navy with
that silver like a dark blue
that's that color payoff so for only a
dollar eighty that's pretty freakin good
so I really am excited to try them out
and I'll give you kind of an update on
what I think of these if you're
interested okay so next place I went to
was Charlotte Russe got a I mostly
bought shorts there but I mean did get a
pair of sandals you guys know I love my
sandals and I feel like you can never
have too many so I picked these up I can
actually got them in size 9 usually I'm
a true size 8 but their size 8th were
really small so I picked up in a size 9
fixed perfectly and then they're only
750 so you guys know I feel like you can
track too many and they're just really
nice and plain so all these shorts which
they're just three of them they're in a
size 5 so the first pair I got were
these really pretty just regular blue
jean shorts they're just cute for like
everyday you know everyday wear and
these were only $24.99 then I also
picked up a black pair of shorts because
I don't have any so they just look like
this really cute they kind of like
remind me of like rodeo kind of style
but I really like them I don't know and
this is just what the back looks like
and these were only 25 dollars as well
and then the last pair I got were these
really black black bright blue shorts
and I love these these fit perfectly out
of all of the shorts and I really love
them so they just look like this I don't
know what the deal is with me and dark
or blues lately I've just been obsessed
so this is what they look like and these
were only $20 and then this is the last
place I went to I went to Marshalls
I really went there to go get some of
the balm products I did find three
things I wanted they were like $27 for
the packets of the bomb stuff but I
to the curling iron section if you
follow me on Instagram and Twitter you
have seen ease and I think Facebook
you've seen them as well because I think
everything I post on Twitter goes to
Facebook I don't know how that happened
but it does I actually saw this curling
iron and I was like a screw getting the
bomb stuff I'm getting this so it is
actually a new me 25 millimeter curling
wand and I only paid 30 $4.99 for this
curling wand I thought that was a great
deal I have it right here because I did
curl my hair with it today it's just the
pink one it has the swivel cord and
everything I actually really like it it
does get SuperDuper hot and let me just
say though I do love this curling wand
but I am so happy I did not pay $155 for
it
I went looked up on site um the day I
bought it which is like a couple days
ago and I was so glad I to not purchase
it for a hundred and fifty five dollars
cuz I've been like no it does come with
a glove and everything and I know a lot
of people told me they found these at TJ
Max's and Marshalls and stuff like that
so check out your local one if you're
looking for another curling iron so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
want to continue to see hauls just like
this one and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
