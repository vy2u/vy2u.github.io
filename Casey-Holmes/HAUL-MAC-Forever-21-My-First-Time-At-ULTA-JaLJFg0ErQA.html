a haul I'm gonna show you some things I
got yesterday and one thing came in
today really excited we're gonna go hang
it into it first off I want to show you
my shirt I know a lot of you will
probably be asking about it it's pretty
much just neon pink shirt and it has a
skull and it goes all the way down I
love this I got it from Hot Topic for
like $20 I'd say yes $20 so I really
love this shirt it's definitely my style
you guys know I love my skulls we're
gonna go ahead and get on to this box I
did order from JustFab and the main
reason why I did is because if when you
were a new member when I signed up it
was like this Monday I do I do believe
yeah like this Monday and it's Thursday
so it came really quickly you can get
free shipping back and forth by one hand
paid four dollars to get it this
Thursday but um what was this thing
oh yeah but when you signed up you got a
pair of shoes for $20 and then when I
saw that the flies and stuff for 25
after that I was like okay I'm gonna get
some more so I got three pairs of shoes
and you don't know just that is a
monthly subscription service 3495 or
3995 i'll put it somewhere right here
how much it exactly is a month and you
get to pick a pair of shoes you could
pick handbag jewelry and get my FAFSA
like I said I got three pairs of shoes
sorry my bangs are really bothering me I
have like more over today than I usually
do so they are bugging the crap by me so
these are the first pair how cute is the
bog I have to keep the box these were
the hild grade black or hill grade I
don't know what you call those that's
what it's called and I'm a flats girl
like I love my flats my sandals anything
like that
I don't really normally go to heels if I
do it's a wedge and it's small wedge and
that's if I'm like going out or
something like that but otherwise I'm a
flat scrub so these are the main ones I
picked first okay these look huge I'm
going to try them on but um
this is what they look like really cute
little sandals and they have kind of
like a padding for your foot which I
really like and they also have a little
heel but I just loved how simple they
were I think they'll go with pretty much
everything like they're so cute and I
love the mix of black and brown so I'm
excited I'm gonna have to try those on
I got these um Minerva I don't know what
you want to call those Minerva again
size 8
I forget what these ones are oh yeah
these are the other flats oh I really
really loved so I thought they were
really cute again they just kind of have
like this detail right here really nice
and plain kind of have like a taupe side
and the back I just thought they were
super cute so that's just what they look
like
I'm really into like the chevron print
I think the chevron print is so adorable
it's really in right now and I had to
get these flats so they're so cute oh
yeah so this is what they look like I
just fell in love with these I thought
they were so cute they'd be cute to wear
to work cuz I have to wear a black pants
and stuff but I just love them I'll put
the link down below where you can go and
check out JustFab if you're interested
all right so Mimi I fiance did go to the
mall and went to forever 21 I didn't
pick up like a lot of stuff at the mall
but I went there and I just got a couple
things
two little things in one shirt I just
got
these little tweezers I like them
because they were pink and I really
needed some for my purse
so I got one of those I also got this
green tea herb facial mask for oily skin
I've never tried it
let me know if you have and if you like
it both of these were a dollar eighty
and then I saw this shirt and I was like
Colton I love this shirt it's so cute
and then he was like you know why I like
it and he and I was like why cuz cuz
it's my motocross um colors so yes I
bought it those are his colors green
white black I just thought it was so
cute it'd be cute to wear like rice day
or whatever or it'll just be
cute to wear on a regular day I really
like it and it was only 13 80 and I got
in a size small by the way this neon
shirt is and as small as well okay so
then I went to Mac I went originally to
go check out the heavenly collection and
my Mac story yesterday is when I went so
you didn't have it out yet but they did
have some of the hate Sailor stuff out
so I bought two things I got the bronzer
in soft sand I really like it the
packaging is just so cute I had to get
some and this is what it looks like
I like this bronzer more to kind of warm
up my skin tone like just a kind of buff
and right here where I would naturally
get like kind of tan so that's why I
really like this I wouldn't contour with
it because when you pack on a lot of
this color it looks sort of orange so I
just like to lightly dust it over my
face just to kind of warm up my skin
tone and then I wasn't sure about this
and then I saw it and I was like I'm in
love with it I was in love when I saw
like videos including this so I wanted
to get this blush for awhile its fleet
fast and by seeing it in videos and
pictures I was like oh my gosh it's so
light it's not going to show up but it
ended up being perfect so it's just this
really great kind of pinky coral color
it's actually a lot darker than I
thought it was gonna be so I really like
this I think it is so gorgeous I cannot
wait to just wear this all the time it's
just so so so pretty so I got those two
from the hey sailor collection then I
went back today to check out the
heavenly collection because I just had
to and I saw the blushes and the
mineralized skinfinish and stuff and I
was like holy cannoli all this stuff is
so glittery and shimmery like I would
never wear it reminded me of the Milani
baked blush is how shimmery and glittery
they were so if you don't like those you
probably won't like the blushes and
stuff that Mac's showing right now so I
went to the eyeshadow part and I loved
this eyeshadow it's called earthy and
it's like a swirl of different colors so
this is the packaging
and this is the product so I didn't have
any eye makeup when I went to the MAC
store today so I just apply this right
at home I pretty much took the white
color and put that on my inner corners
and my highlight then I took like this
little gold color right here and apply
that to my lid and then I swirled it all
together which when you do you get this
really gorgeous like taupe color and I
put that on my outer corners and kind of
blended it into my crease I love this
eyeshadow I think it's so great
especially the multi-purpose part of it
go check it out if you had it so if you
follow me on Twitter and Facebook you
know that I went to Ulta for the first
time I'm so I was so like oh oh well and
so excited I really loved it so this is
my Ulta bag so I'm just gonna start
pulling out things the first one is one
that you guys all probably have and I'm
probably like the last person on earth
to get this but I've never had it before
and I've always wanted it so I finally
got it it's the first Naked palette and
I do have the naked - I've never had the
naked one I know a ton of you think that
I do have it because I have the naked -
I don't I've never had the naked one by
the time that I was gonna buy this The
Naked 2 was already coming out and I was
like well I think I'm gonna buy the
Naked 2 so I ended up buying that and
never about the first one but I knew I
would like this one a lot I do like the
Naked 2 but it's more of like cool tones
and stuff like that but I love my bronze
kind of warm tones so you guys all know
what this looks like
I finally purchased it thank the Lord
I've been looking at it for a very very
long time and I finally just splurged
and purchased it the next thing I got
was this Tarte clean slate deluxe primer
trio I was gonna buy this one the
poreless one but I didn't know if I
liked it or not I'm really picky with
primers so I saw this at the checkout
thing I was like nine dollars and you
get the poreless the flawless and the I
prime they got another little thing and
this is just the Tarte
blush and bronzer on the go Amazonian
clay this blush is in doll face it's a
very pretty pink color reminds me of
pink swoon just a lot more pigmented
so let's doll face really really pretty
and then I got this Park Avenue princess
bronzer which just looks like this I
have a feeling this will be more of like
a blush kind of come I couldn't see
myself contouring with this or using it
all over my face I could just definitely
see it as kind of like a blush so I
really like those two alright next I got
something from Laura Geller and it's the
balanced and brightened baked color
correcting foundation and medium so
that's what it looks like and I wanted
to try this for a very long time and I
finally just splurged on it it's pretty
expensive but I think it's worth it so
this is what the packaging looks like
it's super cute and that's what it looks
like and again I got this in medium I
purchased some drugstore foundation I
think it was a fizzle lift from L'Oreal
I'm having to take that back because
it's breaking me out and it makes me
super oily and I tried the Revlon primer
like the photo-ready primer that made me
super oily as well so I'm just think I'm
gonna stick with higher end stuff
because it's the only things that don't
break me out or make me look absolutely
nuts if this works to me I might just
stick with you know powder foundation
instead of doing liquids because liquids
a pain anyways and I feel like this is
just easier to kind of put on and go I
feel like so we'll see how I like this
but I was really excited to finally pick
this up alright and the last things are
from NYX I didn't go too crazy at Ulta
get rid of this bag Nickolas buy one get
one half off so the first thing I got
was this NYX color lip balm and DANC DEA
nke it's like a nude color it looked
really pretty when i swatched it in the
store so it's just like a nice nude balm
yeah that's gonna be really pretty and
that's it right there I don't know if
you can see it but it has a really nice
kind of color payoff just a nice nude so
I wanted to get that and then I also got
the NYX matte blotting papers I just
needed some so I decided to pick up some
from NYX and anything that says Matt I
always give a try and then I also got
the NYX shine killer this is what that
looks like
because my face looks as oily as the
persons in this photo and I won't mind
to look like the way their face looks
like in the other one so trying to find
a primer actually works for my skin and
a foundation so I'm in a really tough
spot right now and then I got this NYX
blush and pinched I've heard a lot of
good things about this blush so I want
to pick it up oh yeah this is pretty I
think it would be pray just to kind of
add some color to my cheeks so that's it
right there
you can just see it I don't know but
it's a really really pretty color and I
like Nick's blushes I have one in I
think it's soft rose I love that blush
it's really pretty and then I just got
the infamous sugar pie lip gloss I
wanted to get it for so long and I
finally was able to pick it up if you've
never seen sugar pie before that's it
right there
really nice kind of nude color the last
thing that I got yesterday was this in
my ex HD photogenic concealer I wanted
the concealer in a jar but I could not
find it anywhere so I just picked this
up and I think I'm gonna like it I got
it in glow so if you have this concealer
let me know if you like it down below
I'm excited to try it and that was all I
got from Ulta I can't wait to go to
another Ulta again I know I said I was
doing like no makeup July if you follow
me on Twitter and stuff like that but
you know when you go to Ulta and you go
to Mac it's like can I really justify
not buying any makeup and there's all
this beautiful stuff around me and
granted I know I don't need any more
makeup but I just get in these like
splurging moments where I'm like I need
some I hope you guys like this haul
don't forget to like this video if you
want to see more hauls in the future I
will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
