you it's just some stuff I've got in the
past couple of days and I bought a few
things over the weekend it's not crazy
but I figured I would show you guys so
if you've ever been to Georgia before or
you kind of live around the Atlanta area
or you know your way around Georgia
you've probably heard of Tanger Outlets
now that's where I went shopping in the
first place I went to was papaya the
first thing I got you've probably seen
this on Instagram if you follow me on
there or I also have this in a video it
is a brown leopard tank top and it just
looks like this it's in size medium and
this was only $4.99 so I thought that
was a really good deal and then I bought
one more thing and this is just a tank
and it's a trichter toys turquoise tank
top and it's a burnout all over when I
first tried these on I had this one and
a white one and I was thinking you know
to have it as more of like a casual
thing like if one day I just wanted to
throw it on and um you know go would be
cool but these are actually really big
so I got mine in a medium I decided to
use as a bikini cover because this
weekend we are going to the river to
kayak and go to bit yeah I bought this
just to go over my bikini we're like
molla days you did something to wear but
I think it's really cute and it was only
$5.99 so it was really pretty good deal
then last place I bought from and Tanger
Outlets was at PacSun this wasn't really
like a deal but um I really liked it
it's a little too big but hopefully
it'll shrink and it's from PacSun and it
is the metal mood I don't know how does
it last word I've tried like three
thousand times but I love like I'm girly
or whatever but I am in love with stuff
like affliction sinful I love kind of
the rocker stuff too skulls and all that
I'm really digging those I always have
so I found this shirt and I absolutely
loved it it's just a nice v-neck and you
see it kind of has like little roses
going down side and then it has a little
skull right there I really loved it I
got it in a size
'i'm it is a little too big but
hopefully the washer will shrink it so
yeah that's what I got from Tanger we're
going again soon maybe there'll be
another haul this month or next month
something like that the next place I
went to was TJ Maxx and this I like TJ
Maxx but I went there to buy a swimsuit
you know for this weekend because I
don't have any and I didn't find any
swimsuits they're like it's so difficult
to find swim schools if you're the kind
that needs to mix match like I'm usually
an extra-large on top small on bottom or
medium so it's just kind of hard when
people have like the sizes put together
it's the most annoying thing ever but
anyways I didn't find a bikini there but
I did find some 3d cute shirts so first
when I picked up was this one and you
can see it cinched in at the waist and
what got me with this shirt it's because
I wanted to show us that I could not
find one and it's the one where your arm
it has like a little cutouts on it or
whatever
I absolutely love it tried it on it fits
perfectly got it in a size small right
I'm pretty sure it's this small hanger
said small but it's not that her like a
little tag on but it was only $12.99 a
tutti max so I really loved that thought
it was a cute simple black shirt that
don't like never go out of style
then I bought this one because I really
love casual shirts especially when I'm
off at anything neon lately I have been
digging and it just looks like this so
this is the front it does hang off the
shoulder so it's really cute
it does cinch in the waist and this this
is the back because there's a tag so
this is the back and it just has buttons
going down the back of it so it's really
cute I'm just nice to kind of throw on
and go if I don't feel like dressing up
or anything like that and by the way
this was a toilet night night as well
this next shirt is one that I bought
because you know during the summer time
you don't really know if it's gonna be
super cold at night hot at night so I
figured this would just be a nice kind
of shirt to wear if it's like raining
and it's kind of chilly so it's kind of
a burnt orange color but I really love
it and this is what it looks like it
cinches in really tightly at the waist
and it just kind of has the rolled arms
and
of course you have the zipper right here
and it's just so cute on like it looks
so cute be great with like white shorts
or something I really really love it so
that's that as soon as I small and this
one was only 16 by me right then this
the last place I went to it was target
since identify bikini at at t.j.maxx I
thought so my target so um let me just
go ahead and say the first thing I
bought I was so excited was there I've
been looking for this concealer for
three months and I've not found it and I
finally picked it up it's the Sonia
Kashuk hidden agenda concealer palette I
have been looking everywhere for this
palette and I cannot find it and I
finally did they only had like a couple
laps so I picked that up I just I had to
have it so that's first thing and like I
said um you know we're going to the
river and stuff and I didn't want to
wear the aviators that I bought from TJ
Maxx because if I lose those like those
are something that's like a find you
know what I mean like it's not something
that's like continually at TJ Maxx like
these are at Target so I bought these
and I target towards the river because
if I lose them you know it's no big deal
but these were only $12.99 there the
exhilaration women's brand whatever that
is I don't know they're 100% UV
protection and I actually like them
normally I don't like glasses like this
but you know what I'm going to the river
it's gonna be sunny and I don't want my
eyes to get hurt and this will test hell
hey block out the Sun cuz I look like a
big old bug so um and I like the fact
that doesn't have the little nose nose
adjusting on it because I could put it
in my hair and it won't like pull my
hair anything like that so pick those up
and then I'll just show you I got my
fiancee I feel like they need a new swim
trunks and he's like please go find me
some so I decided to do that and he's
again kind of like into schools and
stuff like that so I I was looking and I
was like okay there was nothing
that is actually keeping like nice to
buy him and I saw these and I was like
oh my god
oh my god those are it so they just
looked like this and they had love
course this gold all over him and stuff
and oh my god he's gonna love it
if he doesn't love he's just gonna have
to get over it I just like fell in love
I love it and if you're one oversized he
is just 34 okay so the two bikinis I got
I'll start with the one I second like
the best and the first one I like
because I only bought two because I
didn't really have a lot of sizes there
for me this is the first one I bought
and I really like this one it has like a
little bit of padding in it and it's
just the string bikini so this is what
it looks like I like the shape of it -
it's really nice got this in an
extra-large yeah that looks like and
then of course the bottoms I got these
in a size small they just look like this
nice plain old front designs on the back
and they tie on the side so I thought
that was really nice and then so I can
adjust them and stuff
these were oh yeah I stepped on his swim
trunks for $20 if you're interested the
bottoms are $14.99 and this top right
here is I don't know she didn't put
there's not a tag on it so probably like
49ers don't like that this is my
favorite one because I love the color I
love the fringe I'm just obsessed so
these are the bottoms and these bonds
are so freakin tiny but this is what
they look like just has like a nice
little string right there it has a
little fringe on the front these are in
a size medium and these are only $14.99
and this is the top I'm just so in love
with it and it's got nice padding in it
but this is what the top looks like just
nice and fringed your little beads and
stuff on it this was $17.99 but it is so
freaking cute like I just am in love
with it yeah that's pretty much all I
have to show you guys I hope you guys
enjoyed this like little mini haul and I
will see you on the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
