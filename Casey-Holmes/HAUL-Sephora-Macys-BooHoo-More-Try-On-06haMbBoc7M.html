a halt I've got some fashion stuff a lot
of clothes actually and I have some
beauty products and a couple candles I
wanted to show you guys so um we're just
gonna get started ok so I'm going to
start off with candles first I mainly
got a presents from Bath and Body Works
but i did get a couple things for myself
they were having a tuber 22 and then i
did want to get the eucalyptus scrub
because me and Cole more out of it so um
that's actually in the shower but a
picture of right here if you're
wondering what that is but I did get a
backup of my sparkling icicles this
smells delicious and then i also got one
vanilla sugar because i've never tried
the candle sit and I honestly hadn't
seen it in stores I guess I just don't
look really well but this smells really
good I'm excited to try I like the smell
of warm vanilla sugar and it doesn't
smell like it's going to be too
overpowering okay moving on to beauty
products some of this stuff is from
black friday some of its not i'll show
you the items that are not from black
friday first thing I'm going to show you
guys is I got the Estee Lauder advanced
night repair serum I've heard really
great things about this and I actually
bought one for my mom as well so she can
try it out but I've heard awesome things
about this and you guys know I've been
really into serum so ever since I tried
that lore'l one which I'm almost out of
it and I haven't really purchased
another one so we decided to pick this
one up it was pretty pricey but you know
like i said i've heard it's one of the
best ones out there and it also did get
a double wear foundation in the
full-size this is the color 3w one tawny
I'm wearing it today I love this
foundation it's so good if you want to
see it in action i'll link the video
that i just did yesterday and then from
macys I got a new perfume and I'm so
excited about this perfume because I
love it it's smells so good and it
actually lasts a very long time I've
been kind of disappointed with my
product candy perfume I'm actually gonna
see you support will let me return it it
just does not last on me at all like I
can never smell it drop the day did get
the misty or do or perfume and oh my
gosh but just look at this bottle I mean
seriously stop it you are gorgeous and
this is just a really to me it smells
very sexy
and just know so nice I know I'm not
really good at describing smells
everybody on the youtube says that but I
mean let's be real I'm not really good
at describing them but to me it smells
really sexy okay and then I did pick up
something from Ulta I got the torch
Amazonian clay plan on doing a first
impression on this so keep an eye out
for that but i did get this little guy
and i got it in tan honey so I'm excited
to try it okay for Sephora I'll show you
guys some things I ordered before the
black friday sale off but I diggity
benefit gimme brow and I've got this
because I've heard so many people talk
about it so this is just what it looks
like still tube the one is a lot smaller
than my honest asya brow is wand so I'm
excited to see how this works love my
own saucy a brow gel but I figured why
not give that a try because I've been
eyeing it for a while now and I also got
this this had amazing reviews on sephora
and I've never seen anybody talk about
on youtube it's the no bleeding lips
secret lip liner and this is a colorless
lip liner but it helps your lipstick
from feathering out so you can use it
with any lipstick and I'm excited to try
this little guy because I mean I'm not
kidding when I said it had amazing
reviews on sephora which is the main
reason why i bought it and i did pick up
this NARS I shadow base this is a smudge
proof eyeshadow base and I got it
because missglamorazzi talks about it
all the time this is what the tube looks
like and I have used the sample one
quite a few times and I'm obsessed with
it if you have oily eyelids you need
this in your life next thing I picked up
was the Dior extreme lipstick I've never
had a do or lipstick before but I
actually saw this on Instagram Kylie
Jenner was wearing it and I follow her
makeup artist or he does her makeup
sometimes I guess mentioned what she was
wearing and I fell in love so really
dark lipstick and it's in the color
extreme it's so pretty I can't even i'm
so happy i picked this up it looked a
lot darker on her in the picture so
we'll see how it looks on the lips now a
couple other products i did buy that
worn on cell was the purity one-step
facial cleanser i'm almost out of my
other one
so I had to purchase another one this is
my third one I believe so I love this
stuff and I just had to give it back up
and then I also got the benefit
Porefessional somebody's let me know
that they came out with a oil free pour
professional and if they I'm going to go
look home savour so before I even pop
this open i'm going to see if they have
it because i'll get that one instead but
i am running low on the one that i have
and then i decided to try out this
highlighter because i've heard great
things about Becca's highlighters and
this is the becca shimmering skin
Perfector and it's in moonstone the
packaging is kind of ugly am I no lie
but the color is very very pretty you
guys now I've been loving highlighters
lately especially the bombs highlighter
and I heard really great things about
this one so I wanted to give it a go and
yeah we'll just see how I like that so I
got three of the black friday deals bag
I got these online and the first one is
the Too Faced better than sex amazing I
said I wanted to get this mainly for the
mascara the better than sex mascara
because I wanted to do a first
impression on it because you guys have
been asking a lot of questions about it
ten dollars hi you can't can't beat that
and then I also got the tart bright time
deluxe marriage you cuoi alann I
treatment so this little baby comes with
the eye cream and the oil and I even
want to try the oil and I mean you can
always try new eye creams and this one
is the one I'm most excited about this
was ten dollars and they've been really
interested in the boss Jia poor
perfection kind of line they have a
bunch of different poor things and I'm
really interested in them so this one is
a four piece set it includes a
luminizing black mac and also three poor
purifying black strips I was going to
buy the black strips not too long ago
they are very expensive so I was happy
to see that they had this for ten
dollars ok moving on the hook look I did
get two new shoes that came in and you
guys know I've just been really obsessed
with haute look for shoes that's like
the place i order almost all of my
bootys from and almost everything
actually i got a new chair in the middle
today too but i did get these little
booties i love them I've been looking
for booties like this that have the
cutout they have a higher heel which is
really nice
dress up an outfit and I just love the
detail so cute and then I got those but
then I saw these and I really wanted
them as well so they're just like flat
with a little bit of a heel and i just i
love them i really wanted some so i was
really happy to find them on code book
on sale another place that i like to
order from is boohoo.com i mentioned
them before i believe may be around last
year or so but i love their stuff and
they were having a really good black
friday sale i think it was like forty
percent off your order or something or
thirty percent I don't know it was a
good deal so the first thing i got was
this bigger knit cardigan and i really
like this I think it's super super cute
i might try this stuff on I don't know
yet but it just looks like this just a
nice knit grey cardigan and then I also
got another knit cardigan and that just
looks like this and this one's
definitely my favorite pairing this with
a chunky scarf is going to be gorgeous
so I got this shirt because I thought
was really cute and I can wear it like
on Christmas morning or something you
know as my pj but it just says I love
Santa can you see what it was that yeah
just says I love saying on it these
actually fall off your shoulder and I
got one in this kind of salmon pink
color just cinches in at the waist but
it hangs off for nicely these are pretty
oversized so just full warning you about
this color which is called green it's
definitely like a know what kind of
green it is but it's really pretty so
just the same type sinchon at the bottom
and then this was the main reason why I
placed an order because I really wanted
this sweater because to me it just like
fits my personality and I think it is so
funny it says Merry Christmas you filthy
animal I just think is so funny like
stop it that is too funny come on sense
of humor people sense of humor that's
hilarious I love it so I did order from
victoria secret a couple times i'm going
to show you the most recent order
because i wore the other stuff because i
was working out so i did get this little
crew thingy I don't know it has like a
cut in the front and
love pink it's really cute and it's
really long so you can wear it with
leggings I got this because I thought
was super cute and it'd be great for
self tanning because when you self tan
you want to wear loose clothing this oh
what fun so kind of christmas themed i
also got two of these leggings with
jardim or one so i don't have the other
one but they were to 4 30 so i got two
pairs of leggings from it Tori secret
also took part of their deal where they
had the hoodies for twenty-five dollars
but I got this um kind of seafoam green
shade usually Victoria Secrets hoodies
are like oversized so I ordered extra
small and these are a little tight but I
mean they're cute but they're a little
tight so I also got the black one that
just says pink on the front and just
like that and then they also have these
little guys for free their little water
bottles and I've been dying to buy one I
just don't want to pay how much more
these I know I know these were pretty
expensive I didn't want to pay the money
to actually buy it so when I saw you
could get one for free I definitely got
it so this one just says I want
everything and then of course I dig it a
bag for the spinning whatever $75 or
something and it came with some coupons
these guys policies million times but it
came from coupons and a perfume sampler
moving on to forever 21 I got some
different things but I think they're
funny it's just kind of a like drapey
kind of top I don't know it's just
something you could layer with and then
thought it was really cute yeah i'll
have to try these on ever since I
visited la at beautycon I've just been
obsessed with anything that says la
because it just takes me back to how
much fun I had so I love this sweatshirt
it just says la and it's kind of like
that varsity style this is cute just to
be casual and like add some leggings
with it so I love it I think it's super
cute and i love you i know we're
probably gonna ask if i'm going
I'm as la I am NOT going to go in
January because I have a lot of stuff
going on in my life that needs to be
handled first and right now it's not the
time for me to go to LA so I'm very
sorry I wanted to go so bad I plan on
going to New York IMATS as long as
everything works out that I have going
on anyway it's back to the hall I dig it
this sweater it looks really ugly but
it's a high-low and you compare this
with anything just be super casual and i
plan on pairing it with black pants and
kind of tucking it in I got this kind of
graphic hoodie it has a holographic
perfume bottle on it and I just really
like it again pretty casual this one you
cannot make fun of me for I had been I'm
this ever since it came on the site and
I was like you know what it's your
childhood you can't not get it I got
Simba it says the lion king and has
Simba and his little crown oh it's so
cute I want one of those sweatshirts to
say hakuna matata on it so bad and
forever 21 has good sweatshirt so and
then I did get this kind of gold cropped
sweater X what looks like it's just
really cute that would be great for the
holidays and then I did get this red
sweater that is cropped because I'm
obsessed with cropped sweaters so that
is it for this hall I hope you guys
