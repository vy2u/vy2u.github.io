be testing out some new makeup and I
wanted to kind of focus more on this new
J Lo and Inglot clap I don't have the
full collection but I do have this set
right here I can't have you guys seen my
dirty dirty vanity I may have survived
the drop test I have the new Jennifer
Lopez Inglot collection I want to try
out I just have some of the things from
it we have like this little bronzer we
have this highlighter that's a loose
highlighter that actually looks really
pretty in the pan so very excited to try
some of this stuff out Oh what is going
on like it's the universe out to get me
today so since I have this new Inglot
stuff I figured I would feature some new
products that I've purchased recently so
I have this Sunday Riley influencer
Foundation I kind of just want to try
that again so this is the origins pore
perfecting cooling wow this is long I
was reading this and I thought I could
stop after pore perfecting but it's poor
perfecting cooling primer with
willow-herb and then we have like this
hydra Nemus setting refresh powder which
i am so excited to try a couple other
random things that i figured we could
throw in here so if you guys wanna see
me test out some of this new makeup and
see my first impressions then definitely
keep watching if you're not subscribed
already be sure to hit that subscribe
button before you leave and hit that
post notification bell so you can be
notified every time I upload a new video
and yeah I'm really excited to dive on
into this stuff let's just go ahead and
get started okay so starting out with
the JLo collection I did get like a
pamphlet oh here it is I got like a
pamphlet telling more about her
collection she also included a
handwritten note so I got invited to go
to the Vegas launch of all this stuff
but I couldn't go the few things that we
have here to try is like this magnetic
palette which is really cool
don't mind me I'm just looking down
because I want to make sure I'm doing
everything correctly so this right here
is the freedom system palette it says
unleash your inner makeup artist
available in a range of shapes and sizes
this palette lets you customize for any
occasion inside the pocket size palette
you can find a home for
three eyeshadow shades an HD sculpting
powder that were used to create Jennifer
Lopez's campaign look a magnetic layer
on the bottom of the pallet holds it in
place yeah you can take out and put back
in different eyeshadows in this if you
wanted to which is really nice this
packaging is really really nice these
are what the three eyeshadow shades that
I got look like they are stamped or her
initials I did bring out the nudie
patooty palette by Laura Lee just in
case I wanted some sparkle because these
are some pretty plain shades in my
opinion I might need something else to
kind of you know get me going but they
are really pigmented very very soft so
that's what they look like so we're just
gonna prime our eyes and I think I'm
gonna dabble into this and Laura's
palette as well so we'll just kind of
mix and match it's her new palette she
just came out with so pretty I really
love the ombre in here this is a big
palette you guys you get really nice big
sized pans and you get really pretty
colors you also get a mirror first
things first is we are going to prime
I'm gonna be using the Smashbox
photo-finish
lid primer today they gifted me another
box full of all the same products that I
have so I figured I would give this away
20 you guys so if you want to enter to
win this all you have to do is just like
the video sure you subscribe and have
your notifications turn on and then
leave a comment down below letting me
know how I can get in touch with you
whether that's Instagram your email
whatever you feel comfortable with leave
that in the comments below so since the
JLo one has more light to shimmery
shades I am going to go into the nudie
patootie palette and pick up some from
there so the first one I'm gonna take is
undressed so we'll just make sure our
primer doesn't like crease and then our
eyeshadow doesn't stick to our primer
and get choppy because that could happen
a lot I don't really want to take the
bronzer in this one I want to use that
more for my face I just want to see what
it looks like but I really want to
dabble in to think reveal I'll use
reveal in my crease ooh that's pretty
so we're just gonna put this right into
the crease of the big fluffy brush
I went and worked out this morning I've
been working out more in the mornings
and afternoons and for some reason like
every time I work out in the mornings or
like not at night it makes me so tired
so tired so I'm trying to like hustle it
through because it's early afternoon
right now and I'm dead I feel like I
need a nap but I don't need it out now I
think I want to take a little bit of
this shade from the JLo palette with my
Mac 217 and just kind of blend this a
little bit on the lid and into the
crease okay there's a difference between
that I on this I just adds a little bit
more depth kind of smokes it out okay
and then like I said there's not too
much here I think what I'll do is
highlight my brow bone with this one and
maybe my inner corner with this shade
but I can't really do much else with
this palette I'm pretty dang sure I need
to look through this pamphlet again you
can customize the shades in here because
you can take them out there like
magnetized in there so I will let you
guys know down below what other shades
there are if there's only that you could
see all the other shades I'll definitely
do that but when there's just these
three shades I don't have too much that
I can do with it at least if I want to
do more of a dramatic look so I'm just
gonna go ahead and stop there for the
deeper shades but I will go into this
Laura Lee palette and I will take the
shade butt-naked this is just a really
pretty palette all these colors in here
are so pretty I just really like them
I'm gonna focus this here on the outer
half and to me everything seems to be
blending really well now I'm gonna take
a little bit of Mickey Mickey and put
that a little bit more than out of you
this looks super pigmented I am just
using one brush for like all these cuz
it's how I roll
then I'm gonna clean off this brush it's
the best part about this thing is you
can clean your brushes right then and
there and it's dry it's like ready to go
and I love that about it want to try
something a little bit different because
we have that JLo highlighter I don't
know if I
want to use that or if I just want to
use like one of the intents like pressed
pigments in Laura's palette I don't know
if she's calling them pressed pigments
but that's what they look like to me
they look really intense and right now
I'm just taking that clean brush that I
just sprayed and I'm going through and
blending out that looks really pretty I
could do like a matte cream on the lid
and be done but today's not the day for
that I just show you guys some of these
swatches in here so we have own a chiral
we have jaybird that's so cute
I love this then we have buff that is
intense that is a deep chocolate brown
and exposed that one looks really pretty
too now what I'm gonna do is take my
tart shape tape concealer you can use
any concealer you want and I'm just
going to carve out my lid because I love
doing this if I'm going to do like a pop
of shimmer on the lid it makes it pop it
makes it true to color it just makes the
biggest difference in the world I don't
know how many times I have to say it
just makes the honestly it's so good to
do so I'm just gonna take it right in
here and I'm gonna go a little bit above
my crease as well and blend it out I'm
not gonna go too far back I'm gonna
really just focus this right in here
sometimes I get crazy and go really far
back but I don't need to do that today I
did this with the Natasha de Nona tropic
palette and uh telling you it makes the
biggest difference in the world to do
this with really intense colors or just
like super shimmery products so we're
gonna try this JLo highlighter out as an
eye shadow on the lid oh that is gonna
be such a gorgeous face highlight ooh
that is pretty and it's so easy to work
with it's not chunky glitter whatsoever
it's so nice I like this I cannot wait
to put this on my face as a highlighter
I cannot wait this eye I always cut this
crease so well this one I got to really
work with I love that on the eyes I
think that looks so good I even think
you could wet it and it would be more
intense
so I'm just gonna take some primer water
I'm just gonna do a little spritz and
see how intense this is oh okay
oh yeah that is so pretty just adds like
an extra glow look at that it just
really amps it up I'm actually going to
take the shade in her palate since it's
not as deep as these out of these I'm
gonna take this shade and just kind of
blend it on the edges and I feel like
it'll just kind of soften up and it has
some shimmer in there so they'll fade it
out really nicely but it's so pretty
eyes are pretty much done for eye shadow
- the lower lash line I'm just gonna use
the make up for ever matte liner this is
the most matte eye liner ever and let me
tell you it looks so good this is like a
Holy Grail product for me I always go
back to it also you guys I decided to
try the Very Berry hibiscus refresher
today from Starbucks I did not eliminate
or anything like that and I tried it and
I was like it kind of tastes like cough
syrup to me I don't know does anybody
else feel that way do all the refreshers
taste like that if you don't put
lemonade in them I'm curious I'm curious
now now what I'm gonna do is try out a
new primer and a new foundation and I
both I've tried both the primer and the
foundation separately these Smashbox
photo-finish so chill coconut I love
this set and then I'm gonna use this
origins pore perfecting a cooling primer
with willow-herb and like I said I've
only use this once but we'll try it
again we'll try and see how it looks
I should really use the Smashbox redness
primer because my rosacea looks so
flared up right now and it feels hot so
I don't know why
maybe since this is so cold it'll cool
down that rosacea wow this is very cold
I forgot how cold this is oh I think I
used way too much but this more in the
center so that primer feels really nice
and like mattifying smells good fit my
rosacea it's pretty intense right now
but that's okay we're gonna be trying
out this foundation today I will do
probably a wear test on this foundation
just so I can give my full thoughts and
the like how long it lasts and
everything so I have from Sunday Riley
this is the influencer clean long wear
foundation it says it's natural-looking
long wear lightweight feel I'm at
finished medium to full coverage so
Sunday Riley is like a really nice skin
care brand they have really great
ingredients very pricy as well but
surprisingly enough this foundation is
only like I think forty four dollars I
would think it would be probably like
sixty coming from them
I did try this with a brush first and I
was not a big fan so we're gonna try it
with a sponge today and the packaging by
the way is so sleek and clean and pretty
and I love it it does have a pump love
foundations in this pump form so it is
kind of a like runny foundation you can
see it's just kind of running down my
hand and I am gonna use my Real
Techniques sponge to apply this is they
have applied it with a brush and it
wasn't the biggest fan
so let's just see what this looks like
with my sponge foundation is one of
those things that like you never know if
some people can love this I haven't
really washing a review so I should
really go watch reviews on this
foundation because I have no idea what
other people think of it does say on the
website that it is buildable so you'll
see the back redness see you later
actually I have a dermatologist
appointment this month for my redness
just to see you know there's some other
type of cream they can give me I got
like a topical cream for it but it
hasn't really been helping so I'm just
gonna try some other things just see
what the doctor says
haven't been to dermatologists and so
long but my back started breaking out so
bad not too long ago that I went to one
and they gave me a cream for the rosacea
and my back is like so cleared up I had
to get put on medication but it's really
changed like the way it looks but
honestly my back has never been more
clear and it makes me so happy I don't
the bat I'll tell you I like this so
much more with a sponge I feel like when
you use it with a brush it kind of
separates a little bit more it's more
light coverage and it looks a little bit
more dry on the skin I am going to see
if I can take whatever is left on my
hand which is just this little amount
and build up this redness that I can see
right in here obviously if I'm gonna
build up any area it's gonna be my
cheeks and my nose I don't think it's
completely full coverage it does cover
quite a bit but I can still see some
redness peeking through I feel like it
kind of fades throughout the day but
like I said I'm going to do a full wear
test for you guys so we can really see
together now what I'm gonna do is take
the heart-shaped tape I'm going to take
this shade light neutral it's just right
here I also really like that shade
what's Shea with that was that that was
shade 200 in that foundation and I
really really like that shade I'm also
going to take the flower Beauty full
coverage concealer in light and just add
this to the outer part these two are
great concealers they are full coverage
the flower Beauty one is definitely more
lightweight than the tarte one but
that's why I like to use it more on the
outer parts of my face because it's not
gonna look as heavy if I use start all
over sometimes it can look a little
heavy on me and I know a lot of you are
getting this sponge and you get this
sponge and then you use it for a while
then you go back to your smaller ones
and you're like oh my god I can't use it
it's exactly how I feel all the time I
felt like when I went from this sponge
to my Beauty Blender again just to test
it out before I realized I didn't like
the pink one I was like why does this
feel so small
probably because this is like super
ginormous I don't think I'm really
liking this foundation
I just don't I don't feel like it does
anything for me I feel like my concealer
and stuff is not sitting on top of it as
well as it normally does I still have to
set my face but right now I just do not
like they my skin looks okay now we're
gonna try this cool product to see Becca
hidroméis set and refresh powder it says
it's an ultra translucent freshing
powder that dust on like a mist and sets
makeup to help extend where the wait
list powder sets perfects and refreshes
makeup for a silky smooth and visible
finish formulated with 50% water this
powder makes skin look awakened and
fresh upon application as you can apply
it throughout the day to refresh and
rejuvenate makeup so I'm really excited
to try this because I've heard some
Cobra hazy things about this I'd love
that it has like a peachy tint to it
oh that skew says keep me closed to keep
me cool this is so interesting I don't
know I'm really excited to try this I'm
hoping this isn't like not work out for
me oh yes they have the net I want to
use my sponge for my under eyes cuz
that's what I normally do I normally
apply my powders with a sponge I don't
know if I should do that today that's
how I normally do it should I do it yeah
let's do it we'll do it on one side if
anything um so I had the powder that is
weird it really does feel like I put
water on my face oh my gosh
what does this smell like it's so
interesting since I'm doing it with my
sponge it really feels like I didn't
wring it out enough before going in with
powder honestly I'm getting this
absolutely over hopefully you guys can
still see me okay now I want to try it
with with a brush I have a new brush in
here this is from hourglass I'm supposed
to use this with their other powder but
oh I don't think I like that it just
feels so wrong it feels so wrong I don't
know if I like it with a brush I don't
think I do
oh no no no no I don't like it with a
brush because it feels like it it kind
of drags when I use it with a brush like
first setting it down yeah and then I
kind of lost some coverage here no okay
we're going back to the sponge and we're
just gonna set the rest of this very
interesting though very cool very
interesting it's something different
which I can appreciate I just don't
think it's right for me okay this has
been talked about so many times I will
be the first to say I have never oh I've
never been a huge fan of the bye bye
pores loose powder I swear to you every
time I put that on my face to like set
my foundation it moves it and I get so
irritated so I just gave up on trying it
because I tried it like multiple times
even like years later down the line I
tried it and I just cannot make it work
for me I really want to try this coz
I've heard great things it's the bye bye
pours bronzer and it's in beach we needs
that same hourglass brush and we're just
gonna bronze that looks nice I like that
color
oh it's like a nice warm tan ooh I like
it it looks really nice
let me just tan this neck because we
have nothing here anymore this side
looks so much better I wish I didn't use
that brush on this side I knew it I knew
it I think I like that bronzer a lot
that looks so pretty on the skin it
doesn't look too intense it's like a
nice subtle bronze but it gives you a
really pretty tan this is actually
a freedom system palette reusable I'm
thinking this is a contour shade from J
Lo's collab let me look
real quick okay she does have HD
sculpting powders crap Oh suppose to use
the bronzer in her palette I forgot
about that
so the bronzer is golden Sun and that's
this one right here says feel fabulous
with a natural looking tan and sunkissed
glow
lots of bronzers in her collection I am
going to add just a little bit of this
super warm one on my brush here it is so
pigmented I'm a little nervous I'm just
gonna lightly
I feel like blend it out it'll give you
this warm golden sexy look and again you
could use this as eyeshadow if you
wanted to at least I would yeah okay I
like it blended out it is very warm it
reminds me a lot of the girl on Terra
Cotta bronzers if you ever use those
they are very very warm bronzers if you
don't like super warm products you will
hate it that's the same with this color
right here it is super warm but once you
blend it out it just really gives you
this nice tan like this is something I
would take on vacation this color I love
that a lot okay so for contour I'm just
gonna use benefit hoola
it's like my favorite contour that I've
been going back to recently cuz it's
like that perfect color for me I know
I'm mentioning so many powders but I
purchased a lot and I'm also very oily
so powders are a necessity for me but
this is a new Marc Jacobs invisible
finish line perfecting coconut setting
powder just came out not too long ago I
got it in the vib sale this also has the
net which I like hourglass has something
different I bought an hourglass powder
and I do not like the packaging of it
but I do like the packaging of this
butter I should probably shave my face
I'm just not one of those people that
can keep up with it though so I'm just
gonna carve this out like a really nice
light yellow tint I'm just gonna let
that bake there for a little bit you can
look at my peach fuzz that's accentuated
now we highlight so we're gonna use that
same j.lo and Inglot highlighter I'm
just gonna pour some out onto the lid
that is very pretty
whoa I did a lot didn't mean to do that
oh that's a lot Wow all right let's see
can you blend alright well it blends out
that's this I feel like mixed with your
moisturizer and just like on your body
will be so pretty I think for me this
highlighter will be more of a body and
like mixing in with my moisturizer
something like that product not so much
on my face just because I have to be
very careful with how much texture I
have but I think it is really pretty
okay so I don't really have any new brow
products or anything so I'm just going
to go ahead and fill in my brows put on
some lashes we'll come back finish up
the lower lash line do a lip and then we
will be all done so I will see you guys
in just a minute so I'm gonna take
j-bird right here and I'm gonna actually
just smudge this underneath my lower
lash line and just see how it works with
a brush yeah maybe maybe not it's a very
it's one of those products that is
pretty much like it feels like a pressed
pigment so this might not be a good idea
but I'm a risk-taker they're meant to
just kind of like pack on with a glitter
glue or something not necessarily rub
all over your under eye like I'm doing
but I just want to test it out I just
want to see what it looks like I feel
like I need a pop of something under
here so yeah don't do what I did and
like dig in a dense brush into these
because they are nice and packed in
there for a reason they're not supposed
to be meant like to use like that you
can just take your finger and put it
over it and Pat it onto your eye and you
get this really intense glitter it's not
something like topless where this is
more of like a sheen and you could pile
this under there you know what I'm
saying I did it cuz I just want to do it
but I wouldn't do that if you are
getting the palette and want to really
take care of your eyeshadows don't do it
where's my crusty old friend I'm gonna
take this Wet Wild mega slim skinny
mascara I love this mascara I probably
should buy a new one but I'm just not
there yet you know but I love this for
bottom lashes it is so good
puts just the right amount of product on
there before I forget I am just gonna
take the lightest shade in this palette
and I'm gonna highlight my eyes
with this so I'm gonna go underneath my
brow that's pretty that is parete oh I
like that that is a highlight right
there also in the inner corner highlight
just changes a look honestly these kind
of shades honestly just change a look
for me it just brightens everything up
late look at this eye I should have done
this inner corner but this eye compared
to this eye so much better okay so I do
cuz we want to say before we move on
when I was doing my brows even before I
put concealer to kind of try to carve
them out this foundation is like wearing
off right here for some reason and I
don't know why that I don't know like I
can see my redness peeking through here
which is interesting my nose is really
not covered anymore I see redness here
here this is a lipstick that is also in
the JLo collection and is a really
gorgeous red it's a really pretty creamy
red looks so nice I'm not gonna wear
this right now there's also a gloss this
is called lip glossy lip gloss in the
shade Goldy lips
that's cute when I want to wear lip
gloss very rare but when I do I go for
like gold glosses like this to really
make the center of the lips pop I'm
gonna trying out these Sigma cream
Couture liquid lipsticks in new mod and
this I am not tried they're liquid
lipsticks before so let's see looks kind
of moosie I'm gonna take some of those
Goldy lips and just did you do it was
smells good what does this smell like
actually let's take the whole lip okay
guys so this is the final look so far I
really like the way the eyes turned out
I think that's my favorite part of this
entire look is the eyes my eyebrows not
so much because they're sisters like
twin the eyeshadows here are really
really great they blend really well it's
just the color combo I couldn't really
do too much with it I did like this
loose highlighter oh there you go this
is why I don't do like gosh I also
really like this highlight as well the
living in the highlight for face eyes
and body
I definitely think up musings for my
body a lot in the summertime also so far
I do really like Laura Lee's nudie
patootie palette just keep that in mind
when you're working with these really
really intense shimmers that you just
don't dabble into it too hard what I
would do instead is just put down a
tacky base like the Too Faced glitter
glue or your concealer take your finger
in here and just Pat it on and you'll
get the most pigmentation that way and
the least amount of fallout and you
won't ruin the pan in here the maps are
absolutely beautiful honestly I love all
the shades in this palette I can't wait
to use it again and congrats to her I
think this is beautiful for my second
time using this foundation I'm not the
biggest fan of it I just don't think it
fits my needs but we will do a wear test
we'll try it out one more time
third time's a charm right you guys
third time is the charm sit out and see
how it works then we'll do like a full
day wear test after the gym because I'm
know dang well this would not last in
the gym at all unless something's gonna
last through the gym you don't get some
estee lauder double wear huda beauty
lyocell NARS la pro matte those will
last this one
that's it much in with this Becca powder
I'm gonna try it a little bit more for
me I would personally use this with a
sponge not a brush but that's just me
think that's pretty much all I really
wanted to touch on at the end of the
video so I hope you guys enjoyed this it
was so much fun filming it I love trying
out new products I wish I didn't have to
take this eye makeup off right now also
I'm starting to do this bandana thing
just because it really holds my hair out
of my face but still gives me something
going on over here you know so that's
why I've been doing it more I'll try to
get in the headscarf I don't know it's
not there yet that's the thing I can
rock this look think I need to contour
my forehead a little bit more for it
start rocking it thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you enjoyed it let
me know what you think of these products
down below if you've tried them if
you're gonna try anything I definitely
want to hear your thoughts and yeah I
