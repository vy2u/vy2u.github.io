chit-chatting getting ready together and
trying out some new products that are on
the market we have some lunar Beauty I
also have a new makeup revolution
highlighter kit got new covergirl
foundation we've gots some new stuff
here that I can't wait to share with you
guys and to put on my face and while
we're doing that I will be answering
some of your questions and just having a
little chitchat time with you guys I
don't know these are my favorite kind of
videos to watch so I hope you guys enjoy
them as well I really need to wash my
hair so uh I'm gonna do that tonight
anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you do don't forget to give it
a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel
before you leave and don't forget to hit
that post notification bell so that
you're notified every single time I
upload a video and make sure it's all
the notifications like all of it checked
and if you want to get ready with me
with some new products and answering
your questions then let's go ahead and
get started I'm slightly tired today
because not because I'm tired tired but
I had I did like a hard like workout and
now I'm just like Shh you know anyone
else like if you workout too hard it's
just you're exhausted that's why I don't
work out in the mornings but it's like
the only time that works for me right
now one thing I do want to mention to
you guys in my skincare that I have been
using and really enjoying is this new
drunk elephant D bronzy anti-pollution
sunshine serum tongue twister but this
is actually really really good I've been
enjoying it a lot especially mixing it
in with mine which oh I forgot took the
top off especially mixing it mmm oyster
eyes are so for today I am using the
origins ginseng energy boosting gel
moisturizer so I'm gonna mix this with
this serum and what it does is it gives
like this bronzed glow to the skin so if
you're like me and you don't self tan
your face because you're just way too
sensitive then this is gonna be perfect
for you because it adds some color to
the skin but it doesn't look overly fake
you know so if you want to go out with
no makeup on but you need a little color
on your skin this has been really nice I
have been enjoying it so much so what
I'm gonna do is just take a little scoop
of the moisturizer and put that on my
hand and then I'm gonna just take one
full pump of this stuff
so that's what it looks like right there
and then you just mix it all together it
kind of looks scary okay it kind of
looks scary but it's gonna be okay so
then I just put it all over my skin and
it doesn't break me out it doesn't make
my skin irritated and it really just
gives a good color to the skin and
something to kind of help you out a
little bit if you don't self tan your
face I know there's face self-tanners
out there I've tried so many one of the
ones that I really love is by Josie
Maran it's the oil one it's like
specifically for your face it's very
good but you do wash your face at least
I do all the time you exfoliate and it's
just good to have something like that
just in case your face is looking pretty
fair this is not sponsored at all I've
just been really enjoying it I'm gonna
wipe my hands off before everyone my
shirt mmm
I have a new brow product I am NOT it I
have a new brow product that I've been
loving to you guys I've been trying to
film a couple videos but I haven't been
100% happy with them so some of these
I've tried out in videos you just
haven't seen them I've got a lot of good
products right now I do want to do a
full wear test on this foundation and
really show you guys how it wears for me
and let you know my opinion on this
foundation in that video so I will be
showing you today what it looks like
when you first apply it and all of that
but I will be doing a wear test I
promise you I've worn it quite a few
times and I'm gonna wear it today and
then I'll probably film a wear test
tomorrow because I got stuff to do
tomorrow and that's what I'll be using
and filming for you so I'm gonna take
the Smashbox photo-finish lip primer I'm
gonna put this on my eyes just to prime
and like I said we do have the lunar
Beauty which is main emu ways life's a
drag palette and this is beautiful this
is another palette that I filmed in a
video but you guys never saw because I
wasn't 100% happy with it that's just
how I am and I did like a really warm
toned look with it and I was like if I
upload this people are not gonna like it
they're gonna want a different look I
don't want to do a lot of color but like
I have some blue and yellow on my shirt
maybe we could kind of do something with
that this is what it looks like it's so
beautiful I saw meanies video with this
and I've mentioned this a couple times
before but this is so much bigger than
what I thought it was going to be I
didn't think it was gonna be like a
super small palette but I was pleasantly
I'm surprised when I got this in the
mail the packaging is really great
quality and I like that it says lunar
beauty here on the top because I store
my eyeshadow palette like this so then I
need to see what it says I love the
packaging of it I think it's beautiful
you do get a mirror and you do get a
brush that I used and I can't find so
we'll figure that out yeah this is what
I'm gonna be using J so I'm gonna zoom
you guys in all righty so I asked you
guys questions on twitter and on
instagram you tube I'm sorry so I'm
gonna go to youtube first because if you
go I think it pops up for you guys in
like a notifications thing maybe on your
phone I don't really know how that works
when I post something into the community
tab like if I post that I have a new
video or I post a question how does that
show up for you guys this is like a
notification on your phone I definitely
want to know I find it so fun though
because I feel like I can reach more
people that way too like my subscribers
I really enjoy the community tab I think
it's pretty cool here's one question I
get this question all the time even when
people see other influencers go on brand
trips I always get this question all the
time why do you choose not to go on
brand trips and do you think it affects
your numbers on YouTube because you
don't meaning do you feel like you don't
get more views because you don't go and
post big trip vlogs like so many other
big youtubers there's been quite a few
that I wanted to go on I just didn't go
on because it just wasn't the right
timing
honestly I don't go on a lot of brand
trips because I just don't want to so
let's just say alright first I'm gonna
go with kake face I'm going to set the
entire lid I'm not using a ton of
product because this is really pigmented
so I'm just gonna dust this all over to
set when I get asked to go on brand
trips I do consider it because I do get
asked to go all the time I got asked to
film a video with drew Barrymore I got
asked to go and meet her a few times
which I wanted to do but it just hasn't
worked out so many different brands that
have said hey you want to come on this
trip with us throughout the years and
I've just said no because at that time I
got stuff to do Davis is in the military
as you guys know and he's always gone
right now he's gone for training and
next week he's graduating that training
so I'm gonna be out of town then I'm a
very like I prioritize my time like if I
can hang out with Davis over going on a
brand trip I'm gonna do that if I'd go
on a brand trip but Davis can't go I
don't go
because I barely see him as it
is and I would rather stay home with my
dogs and my husband then go on a grand
trip we went on that Fiji trip which was
so much fun it really made me think like
should I go on more brand trip cetera
because I feel bad saying no all the
time but then again like I'm just doing
what makes me happy and a lot of brands
ask very last-minute and I am NOT a
last-minute kind of gal I got stuff
planned like throughout the months
especially with Rosie days like I just
got too much going on to plan a trip
very last-minute I am so grateful to be
asked to go on brand trips and if I want
to go I'm hoping that the next few that
I get asked I go but yeah a lot of times
I just don't go because I've got other
stuff going on the other part of that
question was do you feel like it affects
your views I do feel like you know it
does affect social media and views in
general because you're not socializing
with the YouTube community which I could
do better at I really could do better at
socializing and everything like I
watched so many people I really enjoy a
lot of people's videos do you feel like
it kind of affects views but I also feel
like I shouldn't have to go on brain
trips to get more followers I'm saying I
feel like I definitely need to branch
out and like reach out to more creator
once again I'm just so busy that like if
I'm not sitting here filming I'm
probably in Georgia or with Davis doing
something fun you know what I mean that
was a very long drawn-out answer but I
get that question a lot so I hope that
helped one said have you officially
changed your last name and I have my
legal last name is changed I changed it
a very long time ago but my last name
will not change on social media just
because people know me as KC home so
that's what it's staying as but yes my
legal last name has changed for sure
someone said are you in Davis
celebrating your anniversary on the
signing day or the ceremony day we do
both but like we're not overly crazy
about it like when we had our
anniversary for the signing day back in
March it wasn't like a huge deal it was
just like oh it's our anniversary like
we have two wedding anniversaries now
and I think we'll probably celebrate the
ceremony date more just because I really
wanted to mentally have that as my
wedding date and my
anniversary so because if you guys don't
know we did get married early we were
moving here to drum it just wouldn't
worked out I couldn't get an ID if we
weren't married and all this other stuff
so we went ahead and legally got it done
and then we had the ceremony later you
can't make a ceremony happen at least
what I wanted in like a month it just
doesn't work like that you celebrate
both but I think for the most part the
one that we will celebrate like the most
is the ceremony date I'm getting very
chatty now I'm not actually doing my
makeup so I think what I want to do now
what color do I think I want to go in
with this yellow this one's in campy I
have used this before and it's actually
really nice yellow it's not too bright
but it's not a mustard yellow anyway
anyways either it blends so well I just
really enjoyed this one I'm also using
the Mac 217 some of my favorites I
always use this brush this brush will
never go anywhere for me and I have a
lot of them because I purchased a lot
throughout the years of me doing YouTube
maybe I'll do this pink in the crease
too and then this on the lid I was gonna
do blue but maybe I'll do blue on the
lower lash line I'm trying to do
something different because people
always complain that I don't do enough
colorful looks
let's take Chi Chi and I'm gonna put
this like right below that yellow blend
it out add some pink in there I wish I
had a different brush for this but I
don't think I have like a super small
blending brush that's one thing I need
to do need to go online and really look
for different brushes and just things
that will kind of make my makeup look a
little bit different slash make it
easier for me because I don't really
have a lot of brushes that are super
small and detailed you know what I mean
I have a lot of blending one I will go
back in with that yellow though and
touch it up in the crease so that we
don't lose it completely if you want to
see like a more intricate look with this
palette there's so many people that have
really beautiful looks with that go in
with campy again which is that yellow
and I'm just gonna go on the edges of
the chi-chi color which is the pink just
to diffuse that out a little bit I don't
think I would have used this brush but
I don't have another one right now kind
of looks like I'm highlighting my brow
bone with a yellow I'm just kind of
going over it she's really blending it
out I don't want anything to purse I
just really want it all blended you guys
didn't want warm tone looks but then I
ended up mixing colorful shades to have
like a nice warm down look ha ha all
right now what I'm gonna do is take my
concealer carve out my lid and then I'm
gonna put on the lid because I think
this is so pretty
also I got a reflector I don't know if
you guys can tell with my necks a little
bit brighter I finally got a reflector
stepping up your skin is been looking a
super fabulous lately I was wondering if
you're still super oily if not what have
you been doing that has helped oh my
gosh I am still an oily oily monster I'm
definitely still very very oily but I
definitely feel like my skincare has
helped a lot with how much oil I produce
like it's not as much but I'm still
pretty oily like I still like to really
focus on my primers and my base and
making sure I would use gel moisturizers
and things like that
I have changed my skincare routine it
hasn't been too much which you guys will
see you'll see a nighttime routine and a
daytime routine and then if I use
anything different I always mention it
in my favorites videos I've just been
using different products that have been
working really well for my skin drunk
elephant has been really great for me
the Dior no rinse cleanser is so good
you guys I know all this stuff is so
expensive
but it's just what worked for me and
that's why I use it you know what I mean
oh my gosh I'm distracted by this color
that is gorgeous
Wow and you don't need a lot of product
to get that Wow Wow
see I like the way Chi Chi and can't be
kind of mixed together because it's a
pink and a yellow but then in a crease
it's an orange but it goes from like
pink orange yellow digging it mani I've
just been taking better care of it I do
masks
I don't overdo it with the masks but I
do like to do once or
twice a week I love sheet masks to
anything that I can just leave on and
not have to really rinse off or worry
about no man my skin has been getting
better I think it's a lot to do with
like water and eating better and just
doing better so I think like my
lifestyle has helped a lot with my skin
care but I'm still definitely very oily
I just still focus on the products that
I'm using and making sure I'm not using
anything too heavy or whatnot you know I
used to always think I didn't like
Pink's but I like it when I wear pink
and I like having pink things so I think
I'm changing my mind but I used to
always be like no I don't like that
color I don't like that color but now
it's like girl you can't deny it it's
everywhere it's in your house it's in
your store it's everywhere
I think that's pretty and then we could
do like a pop of blue on the lower
lashline to add a little bit more color
I like this palette so far the one thing
I love about this palette is that if
you're like me you have these neutrals
but you can just do pops of color as you
go I actually have not been into wings
liner Who am I I know I don't know who I
am anymore so I'm going to do is a
really thin line on my upper lash line I
think I'm going to use the the bomb's
winged liner this is really easy to use
I love it a lot
so I'm just gonna line that and then put
some falsies on and then we'll move on
to face so I will be right back
okay so I've got lashes on I used mink
Miami from Lily lashes I had to think
about that for a second I don't know why
because that's all I use together make
Miami from Lily lashes if you see
throughout the video that they kind of
come off it's because duo have not been
doing me well recently I don't know why
but my lashes will not stay on the duo
sometimes so like I want to go back to
house of lashes lash glue but like the
lashes when you put them on they will
stay forever but it takes forever to get
the lash glue off of your lashes you
know let me know what do you guys think
now I'm going to using this new product
right here from Wet n Wild this is a
photo focused primer water I really like
the way it looks Smashbox is alcohol
free but I believe this one does have
some alcohol in it so just keep that in
mind but I'm just gonna demonstrate it
for you guys today so I'm gonna spray
it definitely smells like alcohol so in
my opinion I wouldn't use this over the
Smashbox one just because this one's
silicone alcohol and oil free if you're
looking for an alternative why not try
it out so I just went ahead and ply that
all over my face and then I am going to
use my touches silk canvas primer which
you guys you all see that do you see the
pan use it right in there it's so light
I hit pan on this I don't even know if
you can call it pan we'll call it tub
I hit tub on this I'm not surprised
about because I love this primer also
been using the cha-cha body butter they
sent me like a care package which was so
nice of them to try out some of their
products and body butter was in there
and you guys know I'm like a ride-or-die
for the loc suit on body butter which I
still AM but the touch-up body butter is
really good too that's like right up
there with my lock seat on one so I've
been loving both of them so so so much
so now what I'm going to do is take the
covergirl trublend Matt made foundation
so this is new they have I think it's 40
shades of this there's a lot to be
mixing to since I'm kind of like on the
we're in over the rear end of my self
tan I'm kind of like at the end of my
self tanner so I'm gonna mix t-ten and L
50 L 50 just lighter yeah I'm gonna do a
full wear test to give you guys my full
opinion on this but I will go ahead and
show you guys what it looks like on my
skin I know you guys have been wanting a
self tan video so bad but I promise you
once I get my opinions down about the
self tanners I will bring it to you I
promise you and it's sooner than later
like I am almost ready to do that video
for you guys I'm just needing to test
out one or two more right now that I'm
currently wearing alright so I'm gonna
go ahead and apply this all over it's
actually like a damn good color badge
pat myself on the back for that one you
do get better coverage with a brush but
I'm gonna go ahead and show you that
today I'm not gonna tell you guys how it
wears throughout the day but I will show
you how these two different techniques
make the foundation look so again this
is the sponge side obviously I'm using
the Real Techniques face and body sponge
I've kind of like covered up my
reflector with all my
so let me just fix this real quick we
feel like it looks pretty dang good
right now on camera but I'm gonna show
you with a flat top kabuki I've been
using the one from morphe so we're just
gonna kind of clean up this eyeshadow I
do feel like it kind of oxidizes at
least on me with all the shapes that
I've tried I do find that it gets a
little bit darker once it kind of sets
into the skin and dries so just keep
that in mind
I find you get more coverage on the
brush side every single time I use this
foundation I feel like right now this
sides looking pretty good from the
sponge but normally like you could still
see I mean you can right here see the
redness sort of peeking through on this
side you definitely get more coverage
when you use the breath and they do kind
of feel like that they have the same
finish the one problem that I have with
this foundation is I cannot get good
coverage on my nose whatsoever that's
what the sponge just with the brush I
like a pretty full coverage nose because
my nose is very pigmented and red I like
for it to last but it just never does I
need your opinions on this concealer
which I will answer some more questions
in just a second but I need your
opinions on this concealer if you guys
have tried it I need to know if it burns
your eyes like it burns mine and I I
don't really want to apply it because I
feel like it really does burn where I
put it it's the L'Oreal True Match super
blendable multi-use concealer let me
know if this kind of burns your under
eyes I think it was a L'Oreal infallible
Pro glow concealer that burnt the crap
out of my eyes I did that on a video
eyes were watering like it stung so bad
but this doesn't sting as much in my eye
as much as it does on my skin now so
like anywhere I put it like if I do the
triangle motion it just like stings that
whole area I want to use it for this
video but let me know if you guys have
tried this I will keep you updated on it
I might try it one more time just to
make sure I'm not crazy I'm just making
my regular concealers today we have
almost used this lipstick we have the
Tarte shape tape and then the k'kaw and
number six so next month Davis and I are
going to Cabo and I am
so excited I am so excited to have like
a vacation my phone will be on silent I
will not be answering anything for a
week I will be posting Instagram post
though I'm so excited to just be on a
vacation together again I think the last
one we went on was Fiji which is so
beautiful with Smashbox that was like
one of the best trips ever and then
before that was when we went to Alaska
Alaska was beautiful
you know we went there in the summer and
it was chilly it was so beautiful I know
it sounds we went in the summer and it
was chilly but we went in like June and
it was pretty chilly and Alaska at that
time if you're from Alaska how hot does
it get there I want to know but I really
didn't care because we got to go take a
helicopter ride to the glacier I'm
telling you I have not seen something
that beautiful before like that whole
helicopter experience I was freaking out
beforehand I'm so so so nervous but oh
my god I think it's because of the hills
and just like how tall everything is you
don't really get the illusion that you
are high in the air you know what I mean
I want to do it again and again and
again it was absolutely stunning I
highly recommend doing that if you go to
Alaska and you're willing to spend the
money on that helicopter ride it is a
hundred percent worth it it's an
experience it really really is what's
your favorite drugstore foundation ever
I have to say I don't know about ever
because I've loved a lot of different
drugstore foundations throughout the
years but my favorite right now is
definitely the LA girl Pro matte
foundation I think it is absolutely
stunning it gives a flawless finish to
the skin it really makes your pores look
small and it keeps you mad for a long
period of time it's like one of my
absolute favorites so definitely that
one Maggie said you said you're a beard
kind of girl what beer are you into
right now so she asked that I actually
tried to Corona Light and it was really
good I've never had a corona light
before I've had a regular Corona but I
didn't know they make Corona lights
which I know is probably the dumbest
thing ever one of my favorite beers
since Davis and I moved up here to
upstate New York is the blueberry beer
I never remember what it's called I
always call it the blueberry beer Blue
Point blueberry beer maybe
oh so it's so good you guys ever come up
this way and you try it tell me what you
think because it tastes like blueberries
I've never tried anything like it before
it is absolutely delicious like I could
just take them back like water I mean
they're good you know it's kind of
dangerous but they're really really good
so that's my favorite beer right now
that's one thing I will definitely miss
whenever we leave here how old are you
currently and at what age do you see
yourself having a babies how many um how
what am I
I think I'm 26 maybe 27 no I'm 26 I know
that is terrible but I can never
remember my age and I want to have kids
maybe like at 28 29 no no no I mean you
could plan it all you want but you know
when it's meant to be it's meant to be
Oh also I'm taking the Marc Jacobs
finish line at coconut setting powder
and whenever we do plan to have kids to
is the number that I want to go for I
don't want three or four anymore don't
think I can handle it so I think two
would be our max for kids I think that's
like the perfect amount because one kid
for me one kid for Davis and then
everybody has a partner for
rollercoaster there has a partner to do
whatever you know I'm saying so once
that would you ever consider doing a
pop-up shop froz days I get this
question a lot as well as if we're gonna
have a storefront so I'll just go ahead
and answer those now I don't think I'm
gonna have a storefront I don't know
what I mean time will tell really okay
should I met right now is just not good
for a storefront so I would not open it
where I am now I do feel like I need a
bigger space already which is very
grateful but crazy so I'm definitely
gonna stay where I am right now with the
shop for at least a year and then I
don't know I might look into something
else but I can't decide if I want to
have a door because it's just it's a lot
of it's a lot of work I can't do right
now I have so much other stuff going on
that a store is just not an option for
me maybe one day I don't know maybe
we'll do pop-up shop he did pretty much
pop shop whenever I announce Jersey days
which was so much fun that was like my
man state ever you got to come in shop
and hang out with me kind of celebrated
the launch of Rosie days and that was a
lot of fun so I might do that again I
don't know where or when I would do it
but I think that would be a lot of fun
also I'm using this gorgeous gorgeous
packaging first off this is the patrick
Star give me life bronzing powder I
really like this for bronzer because
it's nice and warm okay so now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna contour with the
Smashbox oh it's the callee contour
palette and I'm gonna contour with that
shade right there and chisel it out I
know my hands look crazy it's because I
wash my hands so much
okay keep self tanner there and I'm
trying new self tanners and some of them
don't stay there now let's get into a
new highlighter palette that I got in
the mail I don't know if this is
available yet I haven't seen it before
so this new highlight palette was
actually sent to me in PR and like I
said I don't know if this is brand new
or not I feel like it is but it's the
makeup revolution face quad once you
take the sleeve off you don't have like
the name of it so I don't have the name
of this one but it's the more champagne
yellow one so Pat has a mirror so pretty
and just wait till you see these on the
face like holy cow I am going to first
take this shade and I'm gonna bring it
down a little bit further on my cheek
I'm just gonna bring it down like so do
you see that
I'm barely touching my face and I go a
little overboard with these because
they're so pretty I just can't help
myself
these don't emphasize your texture I
think they look really nice and smooth
on this skin just one my favorite and
then I will take this lighter shade here
and I will just top that in the center
to really make it pop don't worry we're
gonna blend I take my brush and I just
go in here and really blend these edges
I'll try to see where these are
available when they're gonna be
available because I feel like
guys need them if you love highlighters
you're gonna love this palette and then
I will highlight my brow bone with this
one but I'm gonna show you guys my brow
products that I've been using recently
and loving so for my brows I do use two
different colors these are the Mac shape
and shade brow tint you have like a
brush tip on this end and then on this
side it is a powder and I'll show you
how I use it I've been really enjoying
this I thought I was gonna hate this but
I like it a lot what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna take the shade tapered I believe
and I'm gonna apply this one to the
outer part of my brows this brush is so
nice because it looks like your actual
brow hairs it kind of reminds me of
micro bleeding like once you get done
with it the brows will look really
natural and full but when you look up
close at them they don't look like you
drew them in you know I start out here
and I just do light strokes and just
start filling it in I like to bring this
color more on the outer half but also
bring it in on the underneath part but I
don't go on this upper half right here
with this color because I find that it's
just a little bit too dark for me
another thing I like about this is if
you want it to be more dramatic you're
doing like a more dramatic look you
could go in with the powder and then
just fill in the areas that you want to
be more intense it's just so easy
because if you miss a spot and you feel
like it's sparse you just done with the
powder and touch it up you don't have to
keep going in with the brush side and
I'm just been really enjoying it
I'm being very light handed with this as
well give like that brow hair effect I
went a little too crazy on my highlight
for this side just so it looks really
good
I'm a little crazy over here see I just
wanted really really lightly with it
like I barely touched my skin but it's
pretty pigmented so it looks like brow
hairs sorry you can hear the dogs
it looks like brow hairs but it doesn't
look super intense you know what I mean
I love I just love the way that it looks
okay so I'm going to use the same
highlight palette that I used for my
eyes I'm gonna use the same brush that I
used for my lid and I'm going to
highlight my brow bone I like to take
the lightest shade in this palette to
highlight my brow bone because I feel
like it really makes it pop so I'm just
gonna play right underneath here oh it's
so pretty
you just really lift that brow it's so
nice and then I'm gonna take a brown
eyeliner so I'm gonna use this one from
Marc Jacobs it's in the shade Brown II
put out my waterline I'm gonna take
pageant queen and push this up against
my lower lash line that is pigmented
it's a really pretty purple too so I
took it inner to outer corner and then
I'm going to take a pencil brush and use
the shade chi-chi which is that pink and
blend it out oh those are pretty
together okay now we're gonna line our
lips I'm going to use this shade from
Mac in boldly bare so I'm gonna use this
shade buff from makeup revolution it's
their matte lip gloss this is basically
like a liquid lipstick a matte liquid
lipstick I guess they call it gloss
because it goes on as a class but it
definitely dries down into a matte lip
like there's no gloss about it you smell
really good it's not cake
this is a completed look I really like
the way it turned out I don't really
like these matte lip glosses or makeup
revolution it's like not my favorite but
I love the new highlighter palettes I
love mayonnaise palette - I honestly
don't use color a lot of the time just
because I don't really gravitate towards
color but I really do like the way that
this turned out I think the colors
blended so well together and they just
really pop like I like the way that this
looks so much it was easy to work with I
really did enjoy the palette I think
it's beautiful have used the more
neutral shades in the palette and they
are gorgeous as well blends so easily
love the new Mac brow product I will
definitely do a wear test on this
foundation twice there really wasn't
anything I didn't like in this video
that is new I just don't really like the
matte lip glosses thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you all in
my next video
