a makeup tutorial using half high-end
products and half drugstore this is a
completely dupe dedicated video this
video is dedicated to finding dupes for
pretty much everything on your face
everything so before we get started let
me know which side of my face do you
think is drugstore and which side is
high in do you think number one is
high-end or drugstore or number two is
high under drugstore I just have a bunch
of new products to show you guys I
really hope you enjoyed this video if
you do like it don't forget to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe I post three
times a week so you'll be notified if
you're subscribed so click the link in
the description box or you can click
this right here and don't forget to give
this video a thumbs up if you liked it
so if you want to see how I got this
makeup look with half high-end half
drugstore makeup then let's just go
ahead and get started okay let's get
started with primer I picked these two
primers we have the soap &amp;amp; Glory one
heck of a blot mattifying primer this is
a great mattifying primer and it is pore
shrinking and then we also have the
benefit Porefessional these are both
super similar in packaging as you can
see so we're going to go ahead and put
the benefit Porefessional on the left
side of our face I focus pore minimizing
primer usually right here in the cheek
area where my rosacea is and things like
that it really smooths out that texture
it's that's really important to me and
these two primers do mattify so if
you're oily that is like ideal now I'm
going to take the one heck of a blot
primer
I'll have the prices of everything
listed on the screen these are both
really great primers I really love the
one heck of a blot one especially with
the one heck of a blot foundation
they're just so so good I have some
videos in the works for you guys and I
hope you're excited because I cannot
wait I cannot wait to film these videos
for you and you see them also going to
be stepping on my Instagram posts so
definitely stay tuned I always start out
with eyes so that's what we're gonna do
I don't know what look I'm gonna do but
these two pallets look identical when
you see them if you didn't see my
drugstore haul and you're about to see
them for the first time you're about to
be like oh my gosh we're gonna be
testing out these two palettes high-end
palate that we're testing out is the
lorac pro 1 palette you can see right
here I've used this a lot it's been
pretty well loved and then I saw this
one from makeup revolution because you
guys recommended it to me and I was like
no freakin way it's literally identical
there's the two side by side
isn't that insane obviously there's a
little bit of a difference but honestly
and not that much at all
so we're I'm gonna do high-end first
let's do that I already know what to
expect your high-end I'm going to take
the shade white and cream I'm going to
mix them together and I'm just going to
dust this all over my lid I don't plan
on doing like a super intense look today
I just want to test out these babies and
see how well they are
okay then what I'm going to do I'm going
to take this flat shader brush from Mac
and what color do I want to go in with
I'm just going to do a lighter easy look
today I'm going to take LT bronze I
don't know that means lit bronzer what
what we're just taking that color I'm
going to put this on this half of the
eye I'm gonna go in with nude and mix it
with white put this in inner part of the
eye I just don't feel like doing a super
dramatic look today sorry this isn't
like a super creative look I just kind
of want to test out the shadows and see
how well they work it's kind of funny
for me to look at these shadows after
the Natasha doe palette I'm like wow
these shimmer shades are like nothing
but they're actually really good they
don't compare to the natasha doe no no
no no one's oh now I keep saying that
but honestly they don't care okay now
we're going to go in for this palette
from makeup revolution doing the same
exact thing wow that one looked much
more intense than the lorac one then
again I'm going to take the Shay which
would be taupe in the palette so far so
good I mean it's not bad
then we're going to take that same brush
wipe it off I'm going to go in with what
would have been ma then going in with
what we've been say bowl right though
yes this one sable in the lorac Pro
palette is a little bit darker and a
little bit more of like a red undertone
I'm gonna just kind of leave it like
that that looks pretty damn similar and
then I'm going to go in with the shimmer
shades damn you see that that's
drugstore that's high-end yo again I'm
sorry this is not like a super creative
look but I'm just trying to do an easy
look so we can just see how well these
work very very similar but they're also
pretty different so I feel like the law
rock side looks a little bit prettier in
a way maybe after mascara and all that
stuff it'll look a little bit more in
sync but I feel like when you start
blending the makeup revolution ones they
definitely kind of blend together next
soup we have is liquid liner this is a
Lancome flexible bendable eyeliner it's
a long wear intense matte finish
eyeliner then we also have this NYX
matte liquid liner which I think I
compared to make it forever liquid liner
um yeah I wanted to compare it to this
Lancome one because I'm gonna see which
one's better
so Lancome one's kind of interesting
just kind of bends and does all this and
then you open it up and it is a felt tip
which I prefer felt tips this one does
dry pretty quickly so you have to work
kind of fast with it the one thing I
will say I like this felt tip more
because it is kind of flimsy at the top
so it's easier to get a really sharp
winged liner but I don't like it
whenever I'm going in the inner corner
my so that make sense okay so that's the
Lancome one
really nice definitely mad the tip of
this is definitely going to get no no
kind of dull and it's going to lose its
shape the more you use it so that's kind
of an you know a bad thing about it but
it is a nice liner now we're going to
use the NYX matte liquid liner this is a
brush tip this one puts off a lot more
product so the actual shape of the
liners are different because you know so
very nice and matte I'm going to clean
this up don't worry and then nice and
matte over here so that's definitely a
good alternative if you don't want to
spend the money on the Lancome one you
okay for some reason this lash is just
not working with me and of course it's
on the drugstore side and we complete
the look it'll look better but hopefully
at least hopefully let's just practice
since we have our primers on we're just
going to go in with foundation I believe
I'm going to be warm nude in the Too
Faced foundation again this is the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation I used to
rave about that foundation all the time
I still think it's a great foundation
you know you just get kind of caught up
with you know other foundations new
things coming out yeah we're going to be
using this one today and I'm going to
use the pro Beauty blender to blend it
out which is one of my favorite Beauty
blenders I love the pro Beauty blenders
has really great coverage and it feels
like super lightweight on the skin
obviously it's a lot darker than my face
and it's even a little bit darker than
my body but we're gonna put concealer on
and everything so it'll look fine she
looks like skin it doesn't look cakey or
anything like that and it covers really
really well as you can see so now I'm
going to take the ELF acne fighting
foundation in the shade sand this one's
a little bit thicker in consistency as
you can see right there it's barely
moving and I'm going to use my favorite
sponge right now it's the Real
Techniques Diamond sponge I'm using this
so much I love it I think it's a great
drugstore sponge you guys honest
so we're just going to put this on this
actually might be perfect
this covers so well I mean I bought this
for an elf video which I did film it but
I did not like the way that it turned
out so I ended up just scratching it but
I tried to sound nation out in that
video and I really liked it I was
pleasantly surprised not gonna lie I was
super scared to try an elf foundation
just because I've tried a couple in the
past and I was like oh my gosh
this is actually a nice foundation and
you don't need a ton like I don't I
don't need that much product I'm almost
done with my face you know what I mean
that looks like a dupe to me same
coverage basically the same finish as
well obviously this side has a little
bit more texture and it's drying down to
more of a matte finish I really like it
if you're looking for a good affordable
drugstore foundation you need to check
out that elf one it is so nice so let's
move on to concealer the concealers I'm
going to try out is again the Too Faced
Born This Way concealer with the with
the Catrice high coverage concealer this
they say it's super high coverage and
that it's like it can cover tattoos but
to me I think it's more of a medium
coverage concealer and this is one of my
favorite medium coverage concealers this
is not full as it's definitely medium to
full the shade light/medium by Too Faced
for the Too Faced Born This Way
concealer
now I wasn't a huge fan of this in my
last video but I did try it with the
Catrice foundation and I did not like
that foundation all the texture that I
have going on right now that foundation
really enhanced it and honey I look like
I didn't know what the hell I was doing
makeup like like I did YouTube videos
girl you wouldn't be able to tell when I
was out about it looked like major cake
face it was just terrible so I don't
recommend that foundation if you have
really textured skin if your oily - not
my favorite but if you're going to try
this concealer out with a different
foundation because sometimes concealers
can sit differently this has a very
strong scent if you don't like that you
might not like this it has a cooling
sensation says swatter proof
that's what they both look like of
course the Catrice one's a little bit
lighter but they give that same effect
of the medium coverage
not too high coverage looks really nice
in my opinion now it's time for my
favorite part which is powder one of my
absolute favorite part bronzing and
highlighting is probably my favorite
powder you guys already know I think I
included these to another video but if
you have not seen that video I think it
was when I tried out the $400 worth of
products I mentioned I love this powder
so much more than a high-end powder this
is a hundred dollar powder now you do
get this size which is the travel size
and you do get the big size but this is
a hundred dollars which I mean you get a
lot of product but the flower beauty one
is like eight to ten dollars and it is
flawless
that was weird moving on to brows I have
two brow products I want to share with
you guys that is a dupe so we have the
benefit Cobra which you guys might love
and then we also have the Ardell medium
brow pomade and I love this one as well
you can see it's been well loved and so
has my benefit Cobra good products just
depending on how much you want to spend
so let's
Oh
now we're going to take two different
brow mascaras we're going to take this
one from Anastasia which is in the shape
or neck but it has like golden warm
tones in it to lighten the brow then
we're going to take the NYX tinted brow
mascara in brunette this one doesn't
have as much golden tones but it still
does that same effect you can see how it
kind of lightens and highlights that
brow now we're gonna do bronzer you guys
know it's like some of my favorite parts
so I'm going to be using the urban decay
Beach bronze and bronze on my high-end
side which you guys might love this
product I it was hard for me to get away
from this for a while till I found some
drugstore dupes just one of my favorite
bronzers it makes you look so bronze so
for my dupe I'm taking the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin bronzer and number 30
sunkissed again putting this baby to
work
then we're going to be taking the hoola
benefit bronzer this is a classic the
other side I'm going to use the Catrice
prime and fine highlight and contour
palette which I just showed in my
drugstore testing out video but looks
like this one's in the shade warm
harmony well this is one of the products
I have for my expensive-ass luxury
makeup haul which that'll be coming soon
I still need to try out some more things
and give you guys a full review because
a lot of stuff I've tried out for that
video that I've purchased super
expensive and super disappointing so
just stay tuned for that figured I would
do this one this is the Sicily orc Lorca
the highlighter blush with white lily so
this is what that looks like
the Dubai half wart is the Ulta velvet
blush in princess
after that we're going to highlight and
I wanted to test out these two so we
have Becca moonstone which just looks
like this obviously Becca is our
variable known brand has amazing
highlighters and for the other side I'm
going to use this essence pure nude in
my highlight or now and be my highlight
and zero one that's the essence one
that's the Becca one I feel like the
Becca one shows more texture so I'm
going to go ahead and do my lips and
then we'll dust away all the baking so
for my high-end side I'm going to be
using the bare minerals friendship matte
liquid lip and then the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte gloss
okay guys so this is the finished look
the lashes are still looking kind of
drinky but that's okay I don't really
see a huge difference even in the lips
the lips look very similar as well
they're both like not a matte liquid lip
like a dry down matte but they both have
like that matte gloss look and they're
very very pigmented which I really enjoy
brows look the same bronzer blush
highlight highlight looks the same I
mean I think it all looks great so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you

thumbs up and share this is probably a
long one but I'll try to put it down but
