I'm gonna be filming a Holiday Gift
Guide for her and I have a few things
here from home fashion makeup skincare
random stuff just to share with you guys
and I highly recommend them so we have
some stuff that's like stocking stuffers
and then we have more present type
things as well so hope you guys are
excited I have a holiday mode t-shirt on
that has the foundations staying because
I just did a facebook live
this is from my boutique Rosie day but
yeah I did a facebook live so if you
want to see how did this look I will
leave that down below so you can check
it out so if you guys wanna see all the
products that I recommend for a gift
guide for her then let's just go ahead
and get started okay so I'm first gonna
share is stocking stuffer ideas
hopefully the woman that you're getting
this stocking stuffer for doesn't think
you think she stinks from these but for
me I feel like stocking stuffers is
always this stuff that you need it sucks
its underwear it's bath products and you
know what I'm okay with it because we
all run out of it at some point and you
don't actually want to buy it so to get
it as a gift and not have to buy it
pretty damn good for me I'm gonna share
three different like body type items
with you guys that you could give
someone actually I'm gonna share four
I'm gonna get to put a skincare product
in there as well so the first bath
product is the body shop British rose
line now I have the shower gel right
here but they do have like a gift set
with like a full line of the scent and
it smells so good
like rose cents or if the girl you know
loves rose cents
she will love this this is really good
it's not too sweet it's not too mature
it's like right there in the middle it's
perfect I love it and I love this body
wash so much I can smell it on my skin
when I'm out of the shower and I have
moisturizer on so again this is the body
shop British Rose line now for someone
who doesn't really like rose cents but
they like a nice and body wash this is a
really good one as well if the lava
Nilla the healthy body wash three and
one sport luxe cleanse shave or
vitalized so you can also shave with
this as well this smells really good
course this is free of all the harsh
chemicals they says it gently tackles
post-workout sweat dirt and oil while
hydrating rose hip and aloe deliver
silky smooth
bursting with breezy freshness skin is
left clean soft and invigorated it
really does smell so good it doesn't
break me out at all I really love this
stuff actually just use it so it's kind
of what this is really nice blob vanilla
is a really good brand alright next
stocking stuffer is for the girl that
says she has dry skin now I don't know
about you guys but I always tell people
if I have oily skin of like oh my skin
is so oily you know she's like casual
conversation if you're looking a hot
mess you explain why for me usually
that's because I'm oily I feel like if
you have someone in your life that's
just complaining about dry skin this is
a really great moisturizer to give to
them either in the stocking stuffer or
as well as a gift this is the take a
deep breath night from philosophy it's
an oil-free detoxifying gel bomb this is
so moisturizing even if you have oily
skin this is so so so good recently I've
been using this because this wind has
been so crazy for my skin it's been kind
of drying me out so I've actually been
using this as a daytime moisturizer as
well and it is really nice since it is
like a gel cream it sinks in pretty fast
but you can still feel that moisture
like when you go to bed and wake up in
the morning you still feel it on your
skin I really like this product I think
it's a great stocking stuffer it's
perfect for the girl in your life that
just needs some more moisture she has
oily skin dry skin I think she'll love
it smells really good too and it has
like a cool consistency it's just like a
little jelly bomb I love it so much this
is another like stocking stuffer slash
gift that you can give and this one's
kind of a pricier stocking stuffer but
let me tell you it is so good when I
mentioned this to you guys are gonna be
like of course and I'm just gonna
quickly I'm gonna briefly go over this
it's the lop seat on ultra rich body
cream this stuff is so good if you have
really dry skin dry legs you know if
someone who suffers with really dry skin
I would get them this because it's gonna
really give them a lot of moisture and
it's gonna lock that moisture in all day
long this stuff and I really quickly
want to mention this for hair tube
someone you know is in need of hair
stuff like shampoo or conditioner I got
mine from TJ Maxx the pure ology hydrate
shampoo and conditioner is really nice I
like this line a lot smells really good
keeps my hair really hydrated and it
makes my hair easier to brush out like
it keeps a lot of that moisture
from the conditioner honestly you could
use those stocking stuffers as gifts if
you wanted to but I just figured out
throw them in like in their own little
section as stocking stuffers because
like I said when I think of stocking
stuffers I think of stuff yummy I love
that stuff and I really recommend it now
we're gonna move on to things that I
just think would be great gifts because
they're amazing so first thing are these
of slippers
I bought these when Nordstrom was having
their anniversary sale and I had to go
back and get a larger size yeah I got a
size 9 I'm usually a size 8 so
definitely size up and read the
description of these on North strim
because they also say to size up I
didn't do that when I first purchased
them so that's why I had to return them
and get a bigger size you know someone
who lives in a cold climate or if you
live in a cold climate and you want some
good slippers these are the way to go
they're fully lined they're really nice
you can wear them outside
I love these slippers they keep my feet
so warm and I think there's best another
like home product that I'm obsessed with
I don't know if they have them this year
I'm not gonna lie cuz believe it or not
I have not been to Target so far for a
bunch of Christmas stuff yet I
definitely need to go umm but last
winter I got these amazing faux fur
robes from there these are luxurious ok
nobody ever thinks these are from Target
because they are so beautiful there's
such great quality
I mean Target has really amazing things
but this looks like something honestly
you would get a like Pottery Barn or
Nordstrom and it wasn't that expensive I
believe it was like 20 25 30 bucks so I
love this robe it's so good if you guys
see these and targeting me to snack them
because they are the best robes ever
they keep you so warm and they're so
soft and just so comfy to wear so Target
robes swords that I had to go get these
because I totally forgot to include them
like I forgot to put them in my pile
before I started filming but you can
also use these as stocking stuffers but
these are like my favorite super warm
socks like to keep your feet very very
warm and their cabin socks I get mine at
Dick's Sporting Goods and the last time
I went and purchased these they were
like buy one get one free or something
like that it was a really great deal
whatever it was and I purchased so many
of them but they are lined with like
fleece I guess it is
very soft and they keep you so warm I
get really cozy really really really
cool feet and these are awesome they're
really cushioning not even really a soft
person I hate wearing socks I only wear
them when I have to and these are the
ones that that I like to go for it okay
next up I want to talk about home since
we have two room sprays that I really
really love I like the back the body
works once too but they don't last as
long as these and the Jo Malone one
definitely lasts longer the LOB suit on
but these both smell really good I think
it's just gonna depend on what kind of
scent your person prefers this one's the
lop seat on roses home perfume it's
really really nice this one kind of has
like the same smell actually this smells
pretty much identical to the body shop
of British rose line so if you like that
scent you would really like this as well
just smells really good really nice and
fresh I keep this one upstairs and I'll
spray it on our bed frame and aren't our
comforter and stuff like that just to
refresh it and then I also love this Jo
Malone one this isn't one I keep
downstairs for the couch and everything
because the scent lasts for so long this
was definitely like a true rose set like
it's not as sweet like this one's not
even really sweet but it's just a little
bit sweeter than this one I don't even
know if sweets the right word but this
one just smells more like a true flower
like a true rose and I really love this
a lot so this one again is the Jo Malone
red roses and this is such a luxurious
like gift and when you buy stuff from Jo
Milan they give me like you're really
pretty box they wrap it up for you it's
a very luxurious gift very very nice and
scent does last really well on your
furniture okay I also want to mention
Alex and Ani bracelets I would wear
these in videos I just hate the clinking
in videos so I never wear them in videos
but I love this one I actually just got
this one for my birthday and it's so
cute it is the one with the paw print
I think these make such great gifts if
your person loves like little bracelets
and stuff I don't know I love stacking
these I actually like the sound of them
when I'm not on camera because I don't
know like the clinking of them I don't
know I just do and they have them in
gold and silver I know these been around
for a while but I really do think they
make great gifts and I loved this dog
one I think it's just so cute
definitely check these out especially
they have dog lover they came out with
these like I think a few months ago and
they are
are so cute I love this I'm gonna how
many times we gonna say cute in this
video okay so the next obvious one is
candles or gift card to Bath and Body
Works I mean who doesn't love Bath and
Body Works candle and when they have
sales they just had like a sale where
you get candles for I believe it was $8
a piece I didn't miss that sale I'm
gonna be dead honest with you I don't
need any more candles but I recommend
waiting for a good sale before you
purchase stuff for gifts I think they're
gonna do one more sale too before
Christmas at least that you should but
this one's one of my favorites
marshmallow fireside this is just a good
one I've never heard anyone say they
don't like it um watch the comments are
gonna be like I don't like that one I
really like marshmallow fireside it
smells good I think it's the perfect
kind of candle to give that if you don't
know what that person likes scent wise
this is just a good classic one to give
to someone because majority people like
it this is toasted marshmallow
smoldering woods fire roasted vanilla
crystallized amber it's absolutely
delicious and this one's really good too
the cinnamon spiced vanilla not too
sweet not too strong and the notes of
this one are fresh ground cinnamon sugar
crystals Tahiti in vanilla Boleyn bean
bean I can't talk to it but and this one
also has a really pretty jar I want to
mention my boutique as well tomorrow
which you guys are watching this the day
that it's happening so today at 8 p.m.
Eastern we have a ton of stuff launching
a ton of stuff great stuff for Christmas
gifts this is one of the items that I
think will make a really great gift it's
just a gorgeous like sage plaid vest we
also had this in a brown color which we
do have coming for a restock but these
are so cute they're fully lined with
faux fur they're so comfortable they're
beautiful and if you guys want to check
them out on models we do have the models
wearing them on the website but how
pretty is that such a unique color so we
have a lot of great vests a lot of great
outerwear but if you kind of don't know
what they would like and you think a
scarf is more up their alley we will
have more scarves I can't guarantee that
this one will be restocked tomorrow I'm
actually looking for the package
try and figure out where it's at this
rust one is one of my favorites they
also have more scarves coming as well we
have another really cute shirt that I
actually wore yesterday and it says I
promise honey this is my last dog it is
so cute so you can wear that shirt go
get the dog and then that's the way to
apologize kind of to your husband you
know I'm saying definitely check out my
boutique I will leave the link down
below if you're not interested in don't
care that's totally fine too but I
figured I would mention just a few new
items that we have though now I want to
share with you guys this this is
actually a PR package but I just want to
share the brand with you because I love
this brand for skincare so this is my
first PR package from them and I'm
really pumped about it because I've been
buying their stuff for like the longest
time this is the drunk elephant skincare
line look at that
and that's so pretty I will say I did
try this moisturizer this is the bee
Hydra intensive hydration gel this did
not moisturize my skin very well it
wasn't my favorite moisturizer the two
items that I a hundred percent recommend
you need to go get them right now is the
TLC Fram boost glycolic night serum
great for people with texture and then
the C from a day serum telling you if
you give someone these to which they are
super pricey so even give them a gift
card if they've been eyeing these that
way they could get some money off but
these are so good they if somebody has
texture sensitive skin oily skin I'm
telling you this these two are
life-changing another really great gift
to give someone is a gift card to their
favorite two nail salon because there is
nothing like I already dread getting my
nails them but then like having to
always pay for them even though it's my
choice you know I don't have to go mail
gift cards are the best gifts to give
because that way they can just go in get
them done and you know they don't have
to pay for it that day because nails are
expensive if yep if you know someone
that has to constantly keep up with them
a gift card to their favorite nail salon
awesome awesome gift a couple gift sets
that I really like this tarte brush set
is so good
any Tarte brush set that they have for
the holiday right now is awesome the
great price you get really nice face
brushes you have one eye brush in there
I have gotten I think I've gotten quite
a few of these brush sets and I've used
them
all but I've kept this one to give away
I feel like this is a really great value
and the brushes in these are so nice
definitely check out the tart brush sets
if you know someone who loves makeup or
just needs more brushes that's a great
way to treat them as well as any tart
blush set - the one that likes spins up
that's just way too much but this one
and then the palette with ten blushes in
it is so good this is $35 they get one
two three four five blushes and these
are really great sizes as well it's
gonna last forever I just think it's so
pretty - this anasazi a Glo kit this is
really nice the sugar one I mentioned
this in my last favorites video so I
won't talk about too much but I feel
like this makes a really great gift I
think it's beautiful I think it's great
for people who have texture don't want
to accentuate it but still want to get a
really nice glow this is the way to go
anyone who loves glow get in this kit
because it's really good if a bronzer I
actually just tried this out today but
yeah this is a really great palette and
it would definitely make for an awesome
gift because look at how beautiful this
is I love it so this is the Park Avenue
princess chisel palette if you want to
see in action I just like I said did a
facebook video you can go check it out
down below but you have four different
bronzer shades two different highlight
shades a nice mirror and this is just a
really great palette the powders are
really nice they blend really well I can
already tell this is gonna be one of my
favorite products so this is a must-have
I feel like somebody can do so much with
this I mean you can use these as IOSH a
nose if you wanted to of course use them
on your face if you know someone who
does freelance they might really like
this as well this from Tarte are just
has like really good really good set
seen out when it comes to time of year
another holiday item is this Smashbox
drawn in decked out shadow contour and
blush palette this is such a cool
palette eyeshadows are really nice
they're very very pigmented easy to work
with
I love the blushes in here you can also
use these contour shades as eyeshadows
as well but look at all these pretty
shades like they're still really
wearable it's just depending on do you
want a lighter look for the day do you
want a more smoky look they're all so
nice so again this is his Smashbox drawn
almost chocolate and this is a Smashbox
drawn in decked out palette I was trying
a bunch of
front pallets for holiday and this one
was my favorite like with eyeshadow
blushes like a bunch of different stuff
in it I just really like this one a lot
last two things I want to mention are
perfumes
uh if this one is not if this one is not
available now then I apologize but this
is a really great one
so this perfume I've almost used up
completely I love this one
it's the YSL mom Perry one and I feel
like this is perfect for any woman I
think any woman would love it it just
smells so good
and it lasts for such a long time and I
can't even describe to you how it smells
I'll leave a link for it down below so
you can go read the notes on it it just
smells so good it smells so yummy it's
not too sweet it's just perfect and the
Mont Prairie perfume from YSL is amazing
and it lasts for such a long time like
on my skin I have a hard time with
perfumes really lasting that one last
really well on me as well as this one
Gucci Guilty is very good as well
lasts a really long time it is pretty
intense but if you know someone who kind
of likes that kind of smell Gucci Guilty
his way to go this one's a Dolce &amp;amp;
Gabana floral drops and this the one in
the frosted tube this was my favorite I
did have the one that was like in the
clear glass and I didn't like it as much
as this one this one just smells so good
again it's like it's floral it's not
sweet it's just so it smells so fresh
and good again I'll leave it down below
you can read the notes on it it's a
really great perfume so those are all
the products for my gift guide this year
I hope you guys enjoyed it I just
compiled a bunch of stuff that I really
love and that are my favorite if I got
these as gifts I would love them I think
