one I'm going to go ahead and just let
you know now it's definitely going to be
a longer video but I have had a ton
requests from you guys to do an updated
Holy Grail products video and I feel
like I have a good stash of Holy Grail
products to show you guys because these
are products that I will continuously go
back to no matter what if I run out of
it I would purchase it
I just adore each and every one of these
products so I figured you know I got a
good bit right here and I'm excited to
show you guys because I swear by these
products I do want to start with here
because I do have a couple hair prep
products that I'm gonna show you and
like tolls or whatever but then I have a
lot of makeup so first off let's start
with hair products the first thing you
guys probably aren't surprised about is
this batiste dry shampoo this is the
hint of color for brown hair and I love
that stuff is about eight dollars at the
drugstore at Walgreens at least I think
it might be a little bit cheaper Ulta I
can't remember I know you can get it
online at Ulta calm I haven't been
seeing these in my local Walgreens it's
in one of the Walgreens but it's not in
another one that's around me so I don't
know what's up with that but I did find
these in one of my walgreens and I love
them I always stock up if I do not have
this in my life we're gonna have
problems this is like a step of keeping
my hair healthy it's not washing it
every day so I need a good dry shampoo
and this one is amazing these two
products are just hand in hand amazing
I've talked about them so many times I
talked about them in my last haircare
video and it's these two we have the
macadamia deeper pear mask which I'm
almost out of again and I'll be
purchasing my fourth one very soon I
adore it and then my organ or my argan
oil from nume I'm actually like halfway
through this bottle I'm so excited
because I never felt like I would get
through this whole bottle because you a
little does go a long way but my hair
has gotten a lot more healthy over the
past few months I've just been taking
really good care of it and if you guys
want to know
more about that and just let me know in
the comments below I could do a video
one like my hair care routine talk about
my color I do put my color in the bottom
bar of the video so if you're wondering
it is down below because I can't
remember the name of it every time but
these two are amazing this makes my hair
so smooth and my hair is never frizzy
it's just amazing and this one if I
literally do not have this in my hair
care you know routine I go nuts and my
hair just gets really dry and gross so
next is a bun maker this one is from
Claire's they're about six bucks apiece
this is a backup because the last one I
had Daisy actually like ripped it to
shreds
I guess because she thought it was a toy
but I adore these they do have smaller
ones but I like the bigger ones the
bigger the better I have super long hair
even without extensions so I do need a
big fun to get all of my hair up in
there
and I do have two videos showing you
guys how you can use the buns but the
reason why I'm mentioning this is
because last weekend I actually lost my
other bun my little bun maker like this
and I decided to use a sock and it was
horrible you could see my hair through
the sock it was difficult to work with
and I realized how much I love this
because this makes making a bun so much
easier you wouldn't even believe I feel
like the texture of this it just grabs
your hair and it holds it in place so
well also I recommend these over this
I'm actually returning this this is the
hot buns I purchased this before I went
to the mall and just got this one but I
don't like these at all I think they're
really difficult to work with personally
these are must-have for me I have to
have them all the time because I'm a
sock bun fanatic okay next I want to
talk about a couple hair tools first one
is always chilling in the back of my
videos and it's kind of hooked all the
way over there so it's kind of gonna be
back here but this is a new me megastar
flat iron I know this has been sold out
for a while but if you follow me on my
social media sites I will let you guys
know when it's back in stock because I
have a feeling when it comes back in its
gonna sell out like crazy
again because everybody's been wanting
this but it's been sold out for the
longest time I love this my hair is so
shiny and it stays so straight for a ton
of day
I literally have never had a
straightener make my hair than shiny
before so if you want to know when this
is back in stock just follow me on my
social media sites I'll have everything
in the description box and also at the
end of the video and I'll let you guys
know when it's back in because they're
gonna notify me so I can telling you so
you can get it for miles and this one is
no surprise you guys I've been using
this for almost a year now
it's my nume curling ones my favorites
are the 32 I know this looks weird the
thirty two millimeter wand and the 25
which is like the 1 inch
I love these wands you guys they're so
amazing my curls stay all day and they
never look like frizzy or anything like
that they look so beautiful and I've
used these in so many tutorials like I
just I swear by these products I really
do I only use newbie products for my
hair like tool wives I even have the new
me blow dryer that I love so I highly
recommend these I will have coupon codes
for this and a straightener for when it
gets back in stock down below if you
guys are interested last thing I wanna
mention for hair is my extensions I do
wear the Bellamy hair extensions and
mine are the 220 gram 20 inch extensions
and number two even though I did down my
hair a lush cherry color these chocolate
extensions still go really well with my
hair they kind of add like a little bit
of dimension in with it so I love them
and this is what they look like they're
really thick I do need to get mine cut I
haven't gotten around to it but they're
so thick and I know I have like super
long hair naturally but I just really
want extra volume especially on the ends
of my hair because sometimes when you
have really long hair your hair can kind
of look a little bit thinner at the ends
so that's why I love these for I think
they look really great they look very
natural I haven't had any problems with
them so I definitely recommend these
guys and I only have I only have four
Weston I have two one on this side one
on this side and then I have two on the
lower part of my head to add some volume
to the link so I highly recommend them
I'll put everything in the description
box and also
coupon code sofa maybe I'm just gonna go
ahead and start with brushes that I love
really quickly gonna go through these
because I talk taught them a lot I also
have a makeup brushes I recommend video
which I'll link below but Sigma I love
Sigma I did purchase my mr. bunny set
and I love that set to death I purchased
that over a year ago and I love it I
love the little kabuki sets these I feel
like are the must-have brushes so first
one is tapered kabuki f-86 I've been
using this for underneath my eyes for
over a year now
I love it it's great to apply your
concealer it's great to set the
concealer it's perfect and then these
are my favorite eye brushes we have the
Sigma e25 this Sigma e35 which is a
bigger blending brush the Sigma e30
which is a pencil brush and then these
Sigma E 15 which is a flat definer brush
and then the grand
I love is Real Techniques I have been
obsessed to these Russians like crazy so
first is these stippling brush I adore
this to like blend out my blush and
bronzer is so good it's just so it's
dense but not too dense
it's the perfect brush seriously so soft
love it and then this one is one that I
like use every every every single day
it's so good it's the Real Techniques
contour brush it's exactly what it is
it's a contour brush and it's perfect to
just get a stronger contour blend it out
oh you guys I love it and they've
actually seen those brushes at Walmart
so check out your local Walmart to see
if they have them because that's where I
purchased a bunch of mine and then the
last brush I want to mention is
definitely a splurge but it's something
that I use every day and it's completely
worth the money that I spent on it it's
the amount of 130-foot brush and I love
this for bronzer this is so good you
guys you can use it for powder or
whatever but I use it for bronzer it's
just it's literally amazing like I can't
I don't know how to really describe it
it's it's not really dead if you're in a
MAC store just go feel it
I know where this brush I use it all the
time you guys probably see it in all my
videos and I know the first time I
mentioned it people were like oh my god
at the price but honestly I use it every
day so it's it's worth it for me the
last tool I'm going to talk about they
are dirty but I use them again every day
it's the beauty blender and this is what
they look like I know like I said mine
are dirty but I know some people kind of
get confused with the beauty blender
dupes in the original Beauty Blender
this one you can get at Sephora and I
believe Ulta and also cherry culture
calm and stuff like that they have these
as well but don't be fooled by the
Beauty Blender and then the BB blender
dupes which you can find at t.j.maxx
because there's a big difference I've
tried the Sonia Kashuk Beauty Blender
Duke and it's it's not good at all I did
a whole video on that last year there's
a lot of kind of controversy about it
because some people are like well I
don't want to spend this much on a
sponge but it's just my opinion nothing
compares to the original Beauty Blender
so if you wouldn't pick it up make sure
it's the original video blender it's
pink or black or white I know they have
a couple colors now but they will all
say original Beauty Blender and I highly
recommend it I know it's expensive but
trust me it'll change your makeup world
onto the products first off we're going
to start with primers and these are ones
that I have figured out the primers that
is best for me and these are the
absolute best primers for my skin type I
have oily oily sensitive skin with big
pores and you know the kind of skin you
don't want so I love this I use the
benefit Porefessional it's an oil-free
pore minimizer and this is really really
good if you have large pores like I have
them right here you definitely want to
check this out because it will minimize
the look of your pores it's so good just
kind of press it into those larger areas
and it does wonders I don't find that
this keeps me super matte so that's
where this one comes in this is the Mac
prep and prime skin refine its own
treatment this helps keep you matte all
day long this also helps with pores as
well so combining the two together is
just
God sent I love them so these are my two
primers that I've used and like
completely swear right I used to not be
a primer lover back in the day but since
I've found these two and been using them
a lot more I'm just like I have to have
a primer every day more foundation now
when I was looking at my foundation
drawer because all my foundations I have
in there are ones that I do use but when
I thought about the ones I had I was
like you know I can't guarantee that
I'll repurchase
one of these foundations again because
new things are always coming out and
you're always wanting to try different
things so I chose drugstore foundation
and it's the covergirl three and one
foundations this is so much better than
Revlon Colorstay in my opinion keeps you
a lot more matte than the Revlon
Colorstay the one that is supposed to be
for oily combo skin this is beautiful
you guys I currently have on 855 right
now that's the only one I have on my
face and I'll use 857 to mix with it and
when I'm really really soft and so I
adore these you have just a nice kind of
satin finish it's not too matte and I
just love it I barely have to block
throughout the day with these and they
last so long on my skin I get
compliments on my skin when I wear these
so I love them I think they're totally
worth it and they're like under $10 I
think so go check these out Revlon
Colorstay is a little bit hot a little
bit it's a lot heavier than this this
feels very lightweight on the skin the
next step is concealer and these are my
favorite concealers for underneath the
eyes it is the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and I have NC 20 and NC 30
these are beautiful you guys I love them
they last so long I've literally used a
pop out of these and the NC 20 is about
down to here now thick right here and
then NC 30 is only like right there but
you only need a small amount with these
and you are fine like it'll last all day
no matter what concealer I use ever I
know that this will always stay in place
they're just beautiful concealers and
they cover so well so I highly highly
recommend these enough for a Mac palette
I have
the Mac Pro and concealed palette
correct yes
in medium I personally did not think I
would get a lot of use out of this which
is kind of sad for me to buy it and
think that but I have used this so much
I use these two shades the most I use
this one to do cream contour and I like
to just play with them this is a good
palette to kind of just play with and
see what you like I do believe these are
the studio finished concealers in here
I'm not positive but I heard that so I
don't know if you know if that is if
these are the studio finish concealer
let me know but I love it it's been so
amazing and it had lasted me so so long
I'm gonna talk about bronzer real quick
I don't have like a blush that I feel
like I would stop everything and go
repurchased and I just think it's a Holy
Grail because I have so many blushes
that are like the same kind of colors I
don't know I just have so many and I
feel like I could use another one if I
used one up but this is by far the
bronzer that I would go out and
repurchase whenever I use it up it's the
Mac mineralize skinfinish and it give me
son I've had this this was one of the
first products I purchased from Mac
actually because I purchased the
foundation and this the first time I
ever went to Mac it was a long time ago
I still have it it still it kind of has
like gotten rid of the dome shape a
little bit which I'm excited about this
is a beautiful color to bronze your skin
with I love it I always go back to it no
matter what I'll put it in my drawer and
I'll start experimenting with other
things just cuz you know you get
distracted especially being a blogger
you kind of like try so many different
things that you forget about you know
the Holy Grails that you have but this
one I I go back to and I'm like nah I
love you it's so smooth so gorgeous on
the skin it can look a little orange if
you're more fair but if you're like a
medium skin tone Oh beautiful I have one
more face product and it is this powder
from Make Up For Ever I barely have any
left this is my second one
I want to purchase another one but
Sephora is not stalking my color which
is translucent natural I love that shade
and I haven't stopped it for months even
on an email list to get a notification
whenever you know they stock it but
obviously they don't want to restock it
so I don't know what's going on
I even tweeted makeup forever I'm like
what is going on but I haven't heard
anything so if you know why they're not
result in my favorite powder please let
me know because I adore this it
literally makes you look airbrushed and
it minimizes your pores as well and it
helps keep me matte I just love this to
set my foundation I think it's beautiful
and I highly recommend it they do have
two other shades that are in stock but
not this one moving on to eyes I have my
Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre this is also
one I've had for a really really long
time as well and I still have a ton of
product left I love this to prime my
eyes it just really neutralizes my lid
and it makes the eyeshadow go on a lot
more pigmented it stays on a lot longer
I have oily eyelids so I need a primer
at all times if I do not have a primer
around not putting eyeshadow on up in
anything in my eyes other than mascara
because it's not going to last it's just
gonna look like crap so this creates the
perfect canvas I mean it's just a Holy
Grail I talked about before I think I
talked about in my last Holy Grail
products video now when I was thinking
about eyes shadow I was wanting to pick
one of the palettes that I had and this
is by far the palette that I adored that
I would recommend to anybody who is
wanting to purchase a palette from like
Sephora and you want to make sure you
get your money's worth out of it because
I know some pallets you're kind of like
I don't think I'm gonna use that much
but this one I feel like everybody would
get some good use out of if you love
neutral shades so the Naked basics
palette this is an amazing amazing puff
from Urban Decay when it first came out
I think everybody who had the naked
palettes were kind of like why would I
want to buy that because I have all
these other palettes from them and these
are like not even cool shades like
they're just playing old shades but
everybody who purchased it pretty much
was like oh my god I love it because
they're all that other than Venus which
is satin and you can do so
things of this palette you don't realize
it at first but these are stunning
shades like you can do a really dramatic
smoky eye you could do a really light I
for the day you can just go to this
palette for anything and it's great for
traveling I I swear by it I think it's
amazing I think it's like 20 something
dollars maybe 30 no no maybe 26 I think
if you're gonna purchase your first
palette it should definitely be this one
I do love the naked one but there's a
lot more shimmer in there you can't
necessarily go to it for one whole look
this one you can and I don't like the
naked tube it's just not my cup of tea
but this one is by far my face okay I
have one more pot I'm gonna show you
guys this one is a discontinued palette
from Wow about put the link below where
you can get this this is the Wigwam
vanity palette this is another great
palette for everyday use you have one
side that is matte one side that is
shimmer you can easily take this from
day to night and I just think it's
amazing this shade is perfect for your
crease you have a dark matte brown a
really pretty gold shade and then this
cream shade down here it's matte it's my
favorite highlight I do believe this is
brulee from wet and wild
I love brulee another matte eyeshadow
from Wet n Wild that you can get
individually this is another great
palette if you're just starting out with
makeup and kind of want to experiment
with different things maybe you smoked
it out or do a really light eye I think
you should purchase this because it has
great pigmentation and they do last all
day last I shadow is coming from my Mac
palette that I made and it is going to
be soft brown this is it right here I
love love love soft brown as my
transition shade I feel like it goes
with anything it just looks so good you
can use this and be done with your whole
eye look okay when liners I have three
have a liquid and two pencils so the
first one is liquid liner Jordana fabula
and black and I love the brown one as
well I'm actually wearing the brown
right now oh my gosh you guys I adore
these these are so good they're so
pigmented so easy to work with and
they're like pins so it's really easy
because it's like a drawing on your eye
I love these I've had this black one
specifically for a few months now I did
back up but I haven't had to use it
because this has been so pigmented I
have had no problems with the felt-tip
kind of like wearing down or anything so
I I love that liner and then for black
stick eyeliner or black pencil liner
this is a covergirl ink it and it's
actually a retractable liner so this is
perfect it does last all day it doesn't
smudge on me it's so black I love this
to tightline it's beautiful and then we
have this one this is a nude eyeliner
from Rimmel this is the Rimmel
scandaleyes eyeliner in nude and it is
so good it really brightens up the eye
if you don't want to put black on your
waterline which I normally don't today I
have brown but for the past couple
months I have been using nude on my
waterline and I love it it just makes
you look so much more awake and I just I
think it looks so beautiful it looks a
lot better than putting white eyeliner
on your waterline cuz it looks a lot
more natural
we're almost done you guys almost almost
done I'm moving on to lips this is the
last category I have my Stila lip liner
and aspiring this is a beautiful nude
liner it's not too nude but yet it's not
too dark it's that perfect shade I got
this off hook look a while back and I
always always always go back to this and
for lipsticks I have two Mac ones this
one is called hue it's just a really
pretty pink nude shade it's not too new
to where you look washed out because it
does have a little bit of pink in it so
this is a great kind of everyday color
and then Crandon nude this is definitely
a more true nude and this will
definitely like make your lips look a
lot more pale but I love this especially
with a lip gloss over top because I
think it's just it's just one of those
lipsticks that is meant to be in your
collection because you can just I don't
know it goes with everything and
especially with a really dark eye you
want a new lip so that's why I like this
a lot
and for drugstore this is actually one
from Milani this is the Milani nude
cream this one has like a watermelon
smell all of these stuffs
good but this is a really pretty
wearable nude I feel like it's a cross
between Hugh and creme de nude and a
little bit of a darker form and I just
think it's beautiful
so Milani and the gold tube new cream
love and then lip gloss is first off the
NYX butter glosses I love these
especially creme brulee this is the one
I'm usually wearing all the time the
only thing is that it doesn't last very
long but they're not sticky which is why
they really don't last long and they
look really good if you don't mind
applying them throughout the day then
you'll be fine with it
so my favorites are creme brulee and
then apple strudel actually like
cheese's went a lot on its own if I'm
doing just like a natural look so these
are my two things I love them and from
Mac I have my Magda polymer lip glass in
patients place which is going to last a
really long time Mac lip glasses are
very very sticky but they last a long
time so this one's patience please and
it's like a pinky nude shade it's really
really gorgeous those with a lot and
this one's by far my favorite lip gloss
from Mac and you can tell because it
does have any writing on it and I use it
all the time this is max fuller
abundance and it's like a peachy nude so
beautiful paired with with any lipstick
honestly ha alright so that is it for
this video I know it was long but I feel
like Holy Grail products are something
that I just I don't know I have a bunch
of which is a good thing because I can
always go back to certain products
thumbs up if you like a skincare Holy
Grail products um I have been using the
these new products with past couple
months
and I swear by them a lot of you have
noticed my skin has changed a lot so I
would love to do that video if you're

up if you are and thank you so much for
