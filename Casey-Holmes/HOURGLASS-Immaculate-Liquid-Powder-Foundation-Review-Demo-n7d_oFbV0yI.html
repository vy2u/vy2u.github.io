a review you guys have been asking for
this review for a very long time I've
been using this product for a couple
months and I figured it's about time
that I did a review because I've had
enough time to figure out what I think
about it the hourglass immaculate liquid
powder foundation it's mattifying and
oil-free this is specifically for people
with oily skin if you have dry skin
don't even try this personally I have
oily skin all over it's very rare that I
get dry patches sometimes I do but it's
very very rare I personally think that
even if you have like combo skin and you
have dry patches I wouldn't try this
because even with oily skin it feels
like it kind of dries out your skin I
don't know it's like a weird feeling but
you do say oil-free for a long time so
it does really work really well okay so
this is what the bottle looks like it's
really nice and sleek it is a pump
Foundation which I enjoy and it is about
$58 I do believe I will put the exact
amount right here and I have had this
foundation for a while now it does last
for quite a few hours I'd say about six
hours looking good
I think when you get to about 8 hours it
starts looking a little not so cute it
kind of breaks up a little bit and I
don't really like that so if I'm going
to like a special event for a little
while and I don't want to have to worry
about touching up and REE powdering I
will wear this foundation I worked for
about 6 hours and I'm good I want to
wear it anymore because it does kind of
start breaking up I also find that
whenever I do like my nose contour I'll
you know put my contour on and I'll
start blending it out and sometimes the
foundation really breaks up on my nose
and it takes a couple times for me to
get it fully covered like the rest of my
face this is definitely a medium to full
coverage foundation I think for me after
I do my concealer and powder it is more
of a full coverage foundation but first
applying it it's like it's medium to
full I think it's more full than medium
if that makes any sense but it's I think
it's buildable as well you just have to
be careful with it since it is such a
heavy duty foundation now and then
thing is I was actually award this to
the track the other day and it was kind
of hot outside it was like probably
almost 79 80 degrees and I was kind of
sweating because the Sun was beaming and
I thought I was sweating my makeup off I
didn't have a mirror on me or anything
to check my foundation I didn't touch up
and I got in the car and you couldn't
tell that I was really hot and sweaty
and gross which I really like that
really impressed me I was like oh my god
you can't really tell that I'm sweating
my butt off I'm gonna sound a ssin there
are 16 shades which is really really
great
so I also recommend going and getting
like a sample especially if you self tan
like I do it definitely took me a couple
times to kind of figure out a color that
was even close to something that would
match me this one is a little bit
lighter it's in the color beige it is a
little bit lighter if I just self tan
this is gonna be really light but it's
better than the other one I had you can
just use a darker powder or bronzer to
help it match your neck that's what I
did mine was a little light but once you
add bronzer and blush and stuff like
that it starts to really match so the
two things I like to apply this
foundation with is of course the Beauty
Blender you guys might use this for
pretty much like anything I think this
gives you more of a full coverage look
to this foundation and I also like to
use the brush which is the flat kabuki
f80 from Sigma this will give you more
of a medium coverage and this one will
give you more of a full coverage I know
some people say that the Beauty Blender
gives them a sheer coverage but for me
it always makes the foundation look a
lot more full coverage so I don't know
what what's up with that but if I wanted
more full coverage I'll use this if I
want more of a medium coverage I'll use
this all now if you have really oily
skin and you want a foundation that's
gonna keep you mat for around 6 hours I
definitely recommend this it's one of my
favorite mattifying foundations I think
during the fall and winter if my skin
starts getting less oily I might have to
cut back on this because it is so
mattifying like it's going to make sure
you stay back for as many hours as
possible but if you think you're gonna
be sweating like if you're at work like
a server or something I know how that is
I used to sweat all the time when I was
a server because I would be running
around like a chicken with my head cut
off this would definitely keep you matte
and you would be looking good for these
summer hours that you're gonna work so
that is it
