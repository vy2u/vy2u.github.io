information will be down below so make
sure you please follow them and yeah so
if you're interested in seeing how I get
this curly hair with a flat iron then
just keep watching so the first thing
you wanna do is just brush through your
hair I have already put heat protectant
in so if you haven't go ahead and do so
pure to my data and I'm just going to
section my hair in two parts usually I
don't section my hair but for the
purpose of this video I'm gonna go ahead
and do it it's just gonna be in two
sections I'm gonna brush through it one
more time just make sure tangles are out
and like I showed you guys in the
beginning of the video I will be using
this new me straightener it's not green
yet
I literally just turn it on before I
started the camera so let's give it a
second I'm gonna be taking probably this
big of section sometimes even more so
this is the first section it's like what
an inch and a half two inches something
like
and if you don't know I did part my hair
in two parts one on one side one on the
other okay so the straightener is ready
when I start doing I'm curling on the
bottom of my hair with a straightener
I always start from halfway and then do
the ends and then I'll go back later and
I'll do the rest of it or just won't do
it at all so I'm just gonna take it
about my hair around and pull down and
I'm just gonna kind of do that and let
it go and then I'll just go and do the
ends again and curl it just like that
and like pieces like this that are
shorter if you have layers or something
like that you can go back up to the top
you want to take your arm like this put
it in here and I do all my curls away
from my face no matter what curl I'm
doing they will always be away from the
face so I'm gonna wrap it and go away
from my face just gonna give you a nice
little curl so I think I'm gonna just do
half way on the bottom side I don't know
yeah I kind of changed my mind when I
start doing this because I changed my
mind so often so again I'm putting my
wrist down like towards the floor
putting my hair in the flatiron clamping
and I'm gonna roll back and just kind of
slide my hair down like that and you get
a nice curl I love straightener curls
because I feel like they last a lot
longer than just like curling your hair
regularly with a curling iron or
whatever I don't know why but they just
do to me so again halfway and I'm just
going to pull down okay so when touching
up the curls you can see the top part is
kind of flat and the curls are on the
bottom you could totally just do that
all over and just kind of have a loose
wave effect but if you kind of want some
more curl what you're gonna do is you're
just gonna take the sections again and
you're just gonna start from the very
top you're gonna just same technique and
we're just starting at the root now and
you're gonna twirl it until you get to
that halfway point where you started and
it just
it more voluminous and not so straight
so again I don't if I made any sense
so see where we ended right there we're
starting at the root clamp it wrap it
around and drag it down until you go to
the part where you started your halfway
point and you're gonna let go you have
your curl I don't usually get to like
precise with this I'll just take random
parts and do it it don't feel like it
all has to be super curled so that's
what it's looking like really nice curls
I love the way straighteners cool hair
so I'm gonna do this side and then I'll
come back okay so as you can see I have
curled this side of my hair already I
haven't done my bangs because I'm going
to show you guys how I do that but I'm
gonna finish up this side of my hair
real quick on camera
all right so pretty much done now I'm
going to show you guys how I do my bangs
so these are out my bangs and I'm just
going to rush through them really
quickly and all I do is I flip out the
ends
that's usually what I do when I'm
curling here with a curling iron - I'll
just flip at the bottom so I'll show you
when you go over the top rope clip and
straighten that and then um I'm gonna
take the ends and I'm just going to put
my hand again down towards the bottom
and I'm gonna flip them away from my
face just like that nothing too crazy so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video go up

giveaway I can't like to see all the
