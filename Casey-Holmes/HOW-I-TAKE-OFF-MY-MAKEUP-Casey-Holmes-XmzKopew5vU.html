sharing with you how I take off all of
my makeup so you're in the bathroom
right now welcome to my bathroom if you
take a look right here you can see
yourself you got to see a lot bigger
items that I have I just I wanted my
skincare items not too frequently like I
don't try out new things every single
month I did you try them out pretty
often by the way sorry the Lighting's
off we're working with natural light I
want to show you guys my current speed
hair routine would love to use and you
had to show you what I've been loving
for my skin and I also written to you
guys people on the on snapchat that I do
have any new as being care routine that
I've been doing so I'll show you my
favorite map and things like that so I'm
going to change because I'm not going to
do it in this shirt up so just over your
children what they do is they just watch
me okay so the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to cut up my hair
obviously because no a hair getting in
the way paying off my makeup I have
found a new product that I really love
I've been using here for a while that
mission it's you guys a while back and
it's by enroll loves little right
something cool in row loss low I don't
know I'll see you guys in real close of
it but all you Facebook pages do is just
squirt it on your hand and songa all
over your face and it's going to pick
off all of your makeup it's a good
cleansing oil it's prison system so if
you have sensitive skin like I do you
really like this product because it
takes off it's not harsh and it does not
break you out some oil removers will
break me out really really bad news
column of course but this one does not
do that so that's why I really love it
someone to pick off these lashes you
know if I film a tutorial honors look I
did and it'll be up Thursday
happy for a heavy I honestly need a new
Jarvis but I'm going to just take it
like to do you squirt it kind of does
support everywhere I mean you just
probably saw going to get them in there
I'm going to put between my hand kind of
warm it up a bit and just put it on all
over this just dissolves all that makeup
is great for if you have the dramatic
look on great if you don't have a
dramatic looking you just need all that
makeup
you have a natural makeup lug this is
just a great ways to do that okay now
what we're going to do is we're going to
rinse it off of our face so when you
rinse off you're going to kind of feel
your skin get nice and soft I'm going to
take my purity cleanser and using this
forever if you can watch me for a while
you see me use it constantly and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to wash my
face twice and that's just going to make
sure that I get all of that excess
makeup off and there's nothing lagging
around trying to stay on my face so I
just like to take this all over again
more gently over the eyes and I like to
make sure I get it right to my hairline
as well
okay so then when I'm done
take my clean towel and Pat my face dry
so just Pat it I don't rub just like
that then what I bought my mirror again
I like to oh it just got really dark
I'm going to use it and just clean up
any other excess makeup it's a great
ironing rubber lash line so that's my
basic like cleansing routine for
nighttime you know taking off my makeup
and all of that so I'm going to show you
what I use for my nighttime is I want to
do a mask or something my favorite ones
have been again these enroll as low mass
as well I love these sheet masks these
are probably my favorite because they
actually stay on your face I haven't
tried this one this is the firmament I
have tried the calming one person to
skin and I tried the darker one which
medicine actually be talked but if I
want to use one are you this or I will
use my glam blow clearing treatment
which we just use the other night that's
in my travel bag so when I'll use the
glam bro is like either if I'm trying to
get ready and make sure my skin is nice
and tight and ready to go as I'm
freaking out really bad this is a great
mask for that I found that this mask
really works for me and I noticed the
biggest difference with it overnight so
as always your participant always loved
it if you're breaking out I highly
recommend this one I'm not going to do a
mask today is actually just it won last
night my skin sounds pretty clean and
I'm going to use a night serum and this
is the junk elephant TLC frame booths
glycolic night serum I probably
butchered the crap out of that but you
want to make sure your face is fully
dried up wait for this on my brother a
little bit and make sure you read the
directions there's a tip and it says
slight tingling maybe experience
particularly those first few days
application boy using with any other
products containing retinol or written
white stuff I just use this as a same
drop health and product and another
he really loved these clinics I
purchased this one this one this one and
then I got this as a PR and this is PR
but the one thing I love about these
products is that you are not going to
lose the top the top or twist up and
twist down so everything like that I get
that I'm going to use the night serum I
do have a day serum that I've been using
as well but I think I'm gonna include
that into a morning routine so you guys
can check that out then but for now
since you're doing like I get ready with
me we're just going to do with my pen
routine so I just take three pumps
rather between the top of my fingers
and then and then I just put it all over
my skin I see circular motions to really
work it in there now the day serum if
you guys are probably gonna like laugh
at me but it smells like bacon strips
like meaningless it's not like bacon
strips like the dog treat it's not too
strong but as exactly what reminds me of
and when you think of nightmare for a
while now but I still kind of feel that
tea more than sensations so I don't
really know why that is like I said I
have noticed a huge difference of the
texture of my skin and helps move it is
and I feel like might order a little bit
tighter when I use these products so I
continue to use them but just keep that
in mind like I still experience the
tingling it's been like forever and okay
another thing I like to do is use the
shovel complex ICEA I just used two
squirts to put it on my ring fingers and
then very lightly massage it underneath
my eyes and the problem looks like I'm
going to handle my under eye so I
promise you I am NOT I am so gentle
right now this stuff is so moisturizing
that you can't tell us really at your
eyes challenges so I just played it on
my legs and underneath as well and then
I just slid it right back here okay
skidding around my senses we're losing
light the last thing is this love our
retro whipped cream it says rehab and
recover it has six where African oils by
like this does squeeze up and then you
just pick it off like that and you're
good
I like that packaging a lot it reminds
me of the was it Kate Somerville five
days to you but what I do is I just put
this on top of everything again and I
really kind of take my time of this
moisturizer because it does take just a
little bit more to work in take it down
in back on my chest I really just make
sure it is worked into my skin and we're
not missing anything you know what I
mean so that is my skincare routine you
guys I really hope you enjoyed it you
can kind of see right now that my
redness is a little bit prominent just
cuz that firming serum is stinging this
a little bit but it does calm down when
I wake up in the morning my redness is
really reduced I just try to keep my
skincare routine
fairly simple even when I do switch out
product but depending on how my skin is
looking out feeling I will do a mask or
a little much and I usually use one of
the ones that I showed you guys but
really quickly before I go if you want
to say I do have very sensitive skin
very oily skin and I do have rosacea
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
I hope you enjoyed this kit and ready
with me and I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
