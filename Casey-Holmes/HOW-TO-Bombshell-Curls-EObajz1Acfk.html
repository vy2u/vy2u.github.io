a tutorial on this hair I've been
rocking it in a few videos lately and
I've actually been doing this tutorial
or this hairstyle a lot this summer and
especially since I got this one I've
just been obsessed with it it's
definitely my favorite wand at the
moment granted I don't like the new me
one inch curling wand as much I did try
it again
not too long ago but it's just not my
favorite but this one is like my
all-time favorite curly one that I owned
it's just so different and this is the
new me reversed wand I know a ton of you
have been asking questions about my hair
would have been using and it's this it's
the new me reverse want it goes from
what like 13 millimeter to 25 or
something like that but it is a tapered
sort of wand it's really nice heats up
so fast and it literally takes me ten
minutes to do this I also just want to
let you guys know that they are going to
be giving away to reverse curling wands
to two of my subscribers which I thought
was so generous of them is so amazing it
was one but once I hit thirty thousand
subscribers they emailed me back and was
like you know what we're gonna go ahead
and give away to love ah in honor of me
you know hitting 30,000 thank you all by
the way for subscribing showing your
love and support being so sweet I just
am so grateful and thankful that all of
y'all are just so nice and if you don't
happen to win the reverse curly one
Naomi is nice enough to let you guys
have a serious coupon code I will link
it down below so go check out the site
it's on any wand that you can use that
code for and it's a really really nice
discount so just go check that out down
below thank you new me for letting me
try out this one it is definitely my
favorite out of like any one that I have
so I hope you guys enjoy this video and
I will see you all in next one bye
I said first I'm just going to brush up
my hair get rid of any tangles I have
and don't forget to always put in and
keep protecting I've already done this
before I started filming this video so I
just kind of I don't section my hair I
just pick pretty much like pick and
choose any piece and I do about this
thick Holly about an inch and I take the
curling wand behind my hair and I'm just
going to wrap it around the barrel and
since this has a tapered barrel it's
going to be smaller on the top and
larger pearls on the bottom I just like
taking bigger sections with this one
because I don't want them to spirally I
just want them to kind of be you know a
little bit more loose
so again just taking a really nice big
section probably about an inch or so
space it's pretty big and just wrapping
that around the barrel and I'm going to
do this all over my head
yes I can't above all this mind controls
in overlord
so make mine a double and hold
I can't let you go
so after I get them finger combing and
touching up any areas on the top that I
won't touched up I'm just going to brush
through the curls and it's going to
loosen them up and at first it's gonna
look like a huge fro like on your head
but I swear it'll look good in the end
and so these are what the curls are
looking like soap bar and I also went
ahead and did the other side of my head
just to save time to this video and for
my bangs I like to crow mine with a
straightener this is to do one inch flat
iron I just like the way flat irons curl
my bangs better than curling wands I
don't know I just like a whole lot
better so that's what I'm doing to my
bangs then I'm taking this red pin wax
like 10 I love this stuff I just love to
spray this all over my hair to add
texture and it holds curl really really
well as well so I just like to put this
all throughout my hair and just play
with it and saw I'm happy with it and
I'm gonna go ahead and quit talking so
you guys can enjoy the ending of this
video and I will see you all next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
