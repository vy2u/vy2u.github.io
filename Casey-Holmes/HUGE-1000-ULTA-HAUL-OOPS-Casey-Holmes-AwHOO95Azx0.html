think that's it if you guys want to see
my Ulta haul then let's just go ahead
and get started I've got things let's
hair care skincare makeup we've got a
lot of it
see this so first off I did stock up on
my Vita Liberata self-tanning mints I
love these these are my favorite to
apply self-tanner with also got this
this was a $20 product and it's the NYX
beyond a basic eyeshadow and pigment
palette you have a matte liquid lip you
have a I shadow palette with six
different shades and then a matte liquid
liner so I don't know this just spoke to
me I think these are so pretty and then
the pictures on the back were gorgeous
as well I stocked up on some more dry
shampoo batiste is my absolute favorite
dry shampoo it's from the drugstore it's
affordable I just find that it really
soaks up the oil you know and it's just
so good I did get a high end shampoo
because I wanted to try this out I love
this brand this is the Kendra volume dry
shampoo it's volume 25 new best friend I
don't know I don't know what that is
but I really love Kendra wanted to try
this out so I did pick up this one if I
don't like it of course I'll return it
you know I just like trying new things
and I figured I hadn't tried Kendra's
dry shampoo so I would test this one out
okay
moving on I did get this for Davis this
is a stocking stuffer
oh okay so I also got this hair mask
from pure ology I really like pirata G I
use the hydrate line I used the shampoo
and conditioner and then I also got this
one which is the superfood treatment
basically it's just like a mask I'm
guessing this is a really small tub this
smells like the beach it smells like
coconut oil and just like I don't know
it just smells very beachy so I love
this I love to smell this I can't wait
to try I think I'm really gonna like
this okay so moving on to something a
little bit different I've seen this
everywhere let me know if you guys want
me to do a video on this and like test
it out and see how it works but this is
the Clinique fit workout makeup
basically have the Clinique fit B mat on
the mat this is like the magnifying
foundation and then we also have the
mattifying moisturizer and then we also
have the post-workout neutralizing face
powder which I would just use anyways
cuz my face is red from rosacea I don't
know I figured I would just test them
out
see they're like good I mean I don't
wear makeup to the gym all the time
unless I'm doing like a wear test or
something and I'm wearing makeup and I'm
going to the gym like it just happens
like that sometimes I normally don't put
makeup on to go to the gym so I don't
know I could test these out and see how
they work see if they're good and let
you guys know I think the packaging is
pretty cool though I can like this
packaging Kim K had this sort of
packaging too and I thought it was
really nice most people didn't like it
but I just something about this
packaging I liked it so I saw these um
in the Saint Tropez area and I was
really interested to test it out it's
the 24 hour instant bronzer and you have
the wash off face and body lotion these
both are medium to dark so I got the
lotion one I also got spray I really
love stuff like this especially in the
winter time like if I want to wear a
dress but there's really no sense in me
self-tanning my legs like wasting that
self tan on my legs for one night I will
just use up like this or if my self tan
is wearing off my chest I'll spray
something like this all over and kind of
help color correct everything I have
like a whole little shelf over here with
like self-tanning products I also have
the one night only oil type thing
whatever it's called from saint-tropez
and I really liked that too so I wanted
to add these to my collection and test
them out because I've never seen them
before
next up I have this julep blank canvas
mattifying treatment primer I'm a sucker
for anything that says mattifying of
course because they do have oily skin
and I haven't tried anything like any
makeup stuff from julep so I figured I
would test this out and I figured this
would be a great first product to try to
see if it works well I feel like
magnifying primers can kind of be hard
to ace so we will see if next up we have
a skincare item this is the philosophy
pore extractor mask what really got me
to get this is because it says on the
side and only two uses see virtually
blackhead free skin now I get bad
blackheads like around my nose
especially in this area it's the kind of
thing where I have to go get a facial to
really get them extracted so if you're
gonna test this out it sounds really
good I've never tried anything like this
it just says featuring purifying white
clay salicylic acid and natural
exfoliants are creamy rich formula
gently warm skin upon contact and helps
draw out impurities helping to scrub
away blackheads and shrink the look of
pores so this kind of
to me like glam glow now that I read
about it but we will see how this works
I do love philosophy I think they have
really great stuff I also got this I
don't think I've ever tried anything
from juice beauty this is another
skincare brand those juice Beauty the
organic solution and it's the stem
cellular lifting neck cream I've been
getting bad wrinkles I've had wrinkles
like this on my neck for a while now
just cuz I exfoliate a lot I feel like
and when I was younger I didn't really
apply enough moisturizer to like my neck
and chest so I wanted something like
this that's specifically for like your
neck and your chest and stuff like that
and it just sounded really good and I
figured how to test it up it's
formulated to tighten and smooth the
delicate skin around the neck and
decollete for a more sculpted youthful
look which is what I'm going for I'm
gonna try this tonight so I will
definitely keep you guys updated a
couple of things from models own I got
these color chrome eyeshadow kids I will
I will be dead honest I thought I got
one but I obviously got two of them so
we have golden light and copper luster
and basically it comes with an
intensifying primer a mixing tray and
the chrome eyeshadows you're supposed to
use the primer and eyeshadow kind of mix
it together to give that really intense
effect who had something like this was
it who was in sports somebody who's
before I had this something very similar
but it's just a little pouch and you
kind of just keep it all together and
this one like I said is the golden
lights color Wow
you're supposed to use the mixing medium
or like the primer or whatever but
that's pretty intense so I'm excited to
try these see how they work I will let
you guys know maybe I'll do a drugstore
first impressions
tutorial using a lot of new drugstore
products because there's I have so much
right now
another drugstore product is the NYX
born to glow highlighter palette I this
I'll swatch it now I wasn't going to but
I kind of want to I did get the other
ones I get the makeup revolution a
highlighter palette and it wasn't the
biggest fan of that so I figured out I
test this out and see if it was good
this is what it looks like you just have
six different pans
and does it look - terrible I will again
save this for a drugstore video and we
will see how this works on its own I
also got these aromatherapy shower
tablets I thought Davis and I would
really enjoy these because we love the
smell of eucalyptus so you know just to
kind of wake you up in the morning I
don't think these are super expensive
you get four tablets and it says you
place the tablet in your shower floor or
shelf when it gets wet but it's not in
the main water stream as it fizzes the
aroma releases into the shower and
surrounding bathroom so I snagged these
they had a few different scents like
lavender and some other ones which I
really like lavender too but I figured
eucalyptus would be the best one for the
shower so got a little packet of these
before the bathroom we have quite a
minute makeup left so I had to restock
on my makeup wipes these are the
Neutrogena makeup wipes actually have
some Mac ones that I got in PR and I do
not like them so had to restock on this
because they take my socks off I also
purchased the anasazi of Beverly Hills
darkside waterproof gel liner I'm pretty
sure I haven't tried this and I didn't
even know she had a job liner like this
like it's a crayon liner but I I don't
know I didn't know she had this if
you're wondering on my sweaters from
it's from my boutique you can see it
down below but it looks good I mean it's
kind of like a standard black liner the
maybelline one that i have is a little
bit creamier i will definitely test the
sound that you guys know because I do
have watery eyes so I'm always looking
for the next best thing when it comes to
eyeliner I also have this la girl fine
line long-lasting felt tip liquid liner
and it has like a smaller fill tip which
is good for a winged liner so yeah that
is it right there it's a nice thin line
so I will let you guys know so I
actually found this one I checked out
and I found this one in the makeup
revolution aisle so this is like the
golden bar chocolate bar I showed a
palette kind of like a spin-off of the
Too Faced one I don't really know what
it looks like the picture on the back
really isn't the best so I'm hoping it's
pretty I could have gotten the one
that's like the brown chocolate bar but
I don't know just the picture on the
back didn't like too
we will see actually toothpaste came out
with another palette which is the
chocolate gold palette which looks
really pretty um I guess I'll swatch it
in this video for you guys - I didn't
purchase it but it came in PR what it
look okay
did they coordinate this okay I didn't
know it had like the melting chocolate I
knew that it had this little bar but
hold on who's copying who I don't know
who came out with it first but normally
make a revolution you know has makeup
inspired by hiring things but this just
came out so I don't know this is what it
looks like it's all shimmers so that's
it right there I will probably not use
this palette a lot to be dead-ass honest
with you these aren't really similar to
each other all they're pretty different
this one's a two-faced one this one's
makeup revolution
I just don't know they look oh no that's
a makeup revolution I don't know I might
keep it and see how it works for you
guys let me know if you want to see a
video with a makeup revolution one I
want to swatch this one as well I'm
really curious I was kind of on the
fence up if I wanted to keep this or
give it away just cuz I am NOT going to
use this palette all the time like look
at the colors they have some matte
shades right here which is really great
you know for transition shades and stuff
so you can make a complete look with
this palette which i think is great I
just don't love the color combo he'll
try I mean they look really pretty they
feel dry and chunky I don't know guys
we'll see we'll see how they wear yeah
I'll try them out for you guys I mean
they do look pretty this green is
absolutely stunning actually this like
olive color I don't know we'll see let
me know what do you guys you want to see
a video let me know your thoughts okay
now this is the makeup revolution bronze
&amp;amp; Glow chocolate bar bronzer and
highlighter so it's just like a little
mini Ono's my broke no it's just cracked
a little bit oh I don't know
okay so this is what it looks like you
have the bronzer and the highlight Depp
is not bronzing me yeah this is probably
gonna be returned that's not gonna
bronze me whatsoever so that's the
bronzer at first I thought I dipped into
the highlight that's the highlight the
highlight looks really pretty huh then
this is the bronzer I think where to go
all right so I repurchase the YSL mom
Perry perfume I love this perfume I have
it over here on my shelf and I purchased
this because I'm almost out of the
bottle that I have which is so crazy I
have not gone through a whole perfume
bottle and so long and that one I am
almost completely out of so that's how I
know I love it had to purchase another
one and I just highly recommend it I was
gonna gift these to people for Christmas
I normally don't give perfumes because
sometimes people censor different but
this is one of those sins where I'm like
if you don't like it like why why if you
don't like this perfume tell me why down
below alright just a few more things
that I repurchase the LA girl Pro powder
this is the HD powder in banana yellow
this is a really really great powder
from the drugstore highly recommend it
it doesn't accentuate pores anything
like that set your makeup really well
and it has that pale yellow tint to it
so it kind of highlights as well great
great great powder I went through a
whole one of these so I had to
repurchase another one also repurchase
the anasazi a dip brow and soft brown I
have not used this in a very long time I
just kind of went to dabble into it and
see if I still really liked it I've been
using the makeup revolution brow pomade
that I am obsessed with which I actually
should have repurchased today cuz I'm
almost out but I decided to purchase
this instead and I'm just gonna test it
out and see which one I like more do eye
makeup revolution more songs yeah I feel
like they're all the same but we'll see
I have the makeup revolution one on now
and I think it's like one of the best I
repurchase this because I really wanted
to try this back out and see if I like
it the Revlon Colorstay foundation it
has a pump now which is so good they're
getting fancy on us I'm really excited
about it so I got the shade gold and
caramel of course I got the combo oily
one and I just want to see if I really
like it you know I want to see if I
loved it as much as I used to if maybe
they reformulated any
I just kind of wanted to test it out
again so I purchased this bad boy that
isn't this like a throwback this is a
major throwback for me so have former
things to share with you guys and I did
get another foundation to try out
because I haven't tried any laura geller
foundations out so let me know if you
have and if you like them this is the
laura geller cover lock creme foundation
so it says create the smooth even
complexion you crave with true full
coverage this vitamin enriched formula
effortlessly blends away discoloration
scars even tattoos while locking out
aging pollutants and environmental
stressors for all day flawless coverage
so it doesn't say that it's mattifying
but I like the fact that it says like
it's super full coverage so yeah I just
wanted to try it out and see how it
wears I got the shade medium and it just
looks like this just a little squeezy to
one fluid ounce it just looks super tiny
and then I repurchase the NARS radiant
creamy concealer in medium dark biscuit
I wanted this to be a little bit lighter
I guess it wasn't paying attention when
I was picking this out but I wanted
something a little bit lighter so I'm
gonna have to return that one I do
really like the NARS soft matte
concealer this one right here I use the
shade medium one custard highly
recommend it I'm wearing it now it's
like one of my all-time favorites
honestly I went back to it a few weeks
ago and I'm like wow why did I even stop
using this product because it's so good
I also really loved heart-shaped tape
but I wanted to kind of just use one
thing that wasn't too light and was kind
of like my perfect color and this medium
one custard is perfect for me last two
things I got the model's own that's just
the eyeliner duo it has a liquid on one
side and a pencil on the other the
packaging is really pretty like this
ombre look yeah I don't know I just I
wanted to try it out I love trying
drugstore products and I just saw this
and I hadn't tried it and I was like hey
let's see that seems really black and I
liked the fact that it was a two-in-one
I don't know it doesn't look bad so last
thing I got was his BH Cosmetics
liquid lipstick in the shade Sirena I
have not tried their little lipsticks
before so I wanted to test this one out
and it's just like a pretty peachy color
I don't think I've tried these I could
be wrong it's very pigmented
so that's it right there oh it's my kind
of color okay guys so that is it for
