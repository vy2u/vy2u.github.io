been a hot minute since my face has been
on this camera it's been like I think
two weeks or so I've had a couple videos
up for you last week of course I felt
that I mattes and then they already
pretty film before I left but it's been
a minute since I've sat in from the
camera I have missed you all so much
I've been thinking of different videos
to film and tutorials and things like
that if you can't tell by my voice I am
still kind of sick I'm still really
congested like in my head but it's
working its way out it's been like
almost a week now so I'm ready for it to
get on out because this past weekend I
was literally in my bed like I did not
get out other than to go shopping I'm
not gonna lie but otherwise I could not
go out and do things because I was just
so miserable I'm kind of better I
figured I would go ahead and show you
guys some things that I got from IMAX
and I did some shopping when I came home
because I did some shopping in New York
those honestly things that I just needed
and half the stuff I can't even remember
so I just put it away
so I got some stuff from my minds I'm
not gonna show you the things that
companies gave me that's the kind of
thing that I want to try out their stuff
before I mentioned it to you guys
because it's new brands that I've never
played with before since I didn't do a
lot of shopping in New York I did do
some old I got that comb and yeah I'm
quickly what I'm saying since I have not
gone on camera
since I months I want to thank all of
you so much for coming up to me whoever
came up to me had any nice things to say
thank you so much I really do appreciate
it my Mets
time was insane I had so much fun and
the love was just crazy icefilms
saturday so if you guys wanna see that
blog I'll link it down below for you so
enough of me rambling we're gonna get
started with the video and also if you
want to know what's going on my hair I
have my Bellamy extensions in and I
didn't curl it with the Bellamy three
and one so I'll have all that
information down below with coupon codes
if you're interested okay so let's start
with the two things I got before I met
so Friday we Nicole and just like walked
around you're kind of explored did the
tourist thing and I saw an English story
I was so excited because I've never seen
the English before and honestly I feel
like I had so many things in
that I wanted to get I just forgot it
all and I only ended up getting two
things so I got this lip liner I needed
this lip liner because I forgot to pack
one so this is an English off precision
lip liner and number 63 just doing
really pretty darker nude shade and it
is very creamy very beautiful definitely
one of my new favorite nude lip liners
it is so nice and it lasts a really long
time and of course I couldn't go to
Inglot without getting the infamous gel
liner in number 77 this was definitely
on my list the guy told me he was like
I'm will be our best tomorrow no it's
like no go ahead get it no so this is
what it looks like I do have it on today
I've worn it the past couple of days and
let me tell you this stuff is freaking
black and I'm not usually a gel liner
lover but this has been really easy to
apply and I'm just loving it I'm loving
how black it is how sleek and perfect it
looks this stuff is amazing and it's
ranked about a lot for a reason so
incline gel liner at number 77 is a
must-have and then at my month's I did
get this little Beauty Blender thing it
comes with a case so I thought that
would be really great for traveling it
didn't come with the iPhone teaching
about know where it went so you got two
Beauty blenders and you also got a
cleanser in here which already took out
but I loved this I love beauty blenders
and I thought this was just like super
convenient it was $40 for like the case
the phone charm two blade beauty
blenders and the cleanser so it was a
pretty good deal then a couple other
things I got which this was an IMAX but
I hung out with my whitening Lightning's
crew and they gave me two more lip
glosses
I love these lip glosses my favorite is
nude if you do not have nude in your
life what are you doing because this is
the most amazing lip gloss ever I swear
to you I've talked about it a lot on my
channel I do have coupon codes for the
glosses and stuff like that down below
if you're interested but I got another
nude because I needed a backup and then
I also got this color in Fiji which is a
gorgeous pink color it's kind of like a
pinky purple it actually matches my nail
I should probably not be able to see but
it kind of matches my nails and it's
super
pretty and it's going to be great for
summer so let me go ahead and swatch
that for you guys that's what it looks
like okay so moving on to something that
I actually got after I met but I saw
every body I believe this was the brand
everybody that I met had like glitter
eyeliner and I fell in love like it
looks like perfection the eyeliner was
just insane so I believe it's from this
brand it's called eye candy I ended up
looking them up on Google and stuff and
purchasing a couple things so I wouldn't
even got this set and the set comes with
listing let me show you I got this set
which came with one glitter and then it
comes with the basics that you need
which is the liquid sugar which this is
what you're going to dip your brush in
and dip it into the glitter to make it
easy to apply the glitter it also came
with this little brush and then I don't
remember which glitter it came with but
I'll show you the five that I've got so
I plan on using all of these as like
glitter eyeliners that's the main reason
when I pick them out so I don't know how
well you guys are in the see these
because you can't really tell but the
first one I got is candy apple just a
really pretty red I got this one because
I thought it would be so pretty to have
like a black glitter liner like just a
gorgeous winged out liner this one's in
the shade Black Bart but you won't be
able to really see but it's a black
glitter this one is called
candy corn which is just a nice kind of
muted gold I would say Oh No
look at that one that one was candy corn
I got two candy corns but these look so
different
okay so I got two candy corns but they
look totally different this one is candy
corn as well and this one looks a lot
more gold so I don't know I don't know I
happened there and then this one is
really really pretty this one's in the
color tangerine twist it's just a really
pretty coral gold color again you're
probably not gonna be able to see it
true to color so that smell came with it
was pretty pricey but I mean like I said
the main reason I dye it was because
ever
ready had this like glitter winged
eyeliner and I needed that in my life
okay so that's pretty much it for eye
Mets and New York now moving on when I
came home I went to Ulta and my Ulta
just got it cosmetics back in like a mid
April I would say so they barely have
anything I store my Ulta never wants to
stock up on anything this isn't
naturally pretty palette I've actually
been looking at this for a while let me
tell you the main reason why I do not
get this palette is because of the
packaging I despise this packaging I
think it is just hideous to be quite
honest with you but the colors on the
inside are absolutely beautiful I'm
obsessed with these they are all met and
then you have this transforming Pearl
shade which you can place on top of them
to make it like shimmery I'm personally
a matte eyeshadow lover so of course I
was going to love this palette first off
I knew I was going to love a sunrise and
sunset because they're just beautiful
warmth is a really great transition
shade Java is a great shade to sand the
outer v and yeah you just have like a
bunch of basic shades in here and I
think this one in the lorac Pro are
probably gonna be my top two palettes
ever for matte eyeshadows because these
are very creamy and beautiful so if
you're like me and you're packaging and
junkie don't let the packaging on this
fool you because the product on the
inside is really great so definitely
give it a try if you've been eyeing it
for a while okay next up is something
again I've seen a lot of people rave
about this is the it cosmetics your skin
but better CC cream it has SPF 50 which
I thought would be great for spring and
summer I got the color tan since I will
be a little bit more tan
it looks just like the D or BB cream
like the pump and everything so I'm
excited to try it out again I've heard
it has great coverage I'm more of a BB
cream lover as long as it has amazing
coverage because I do have rosacea so
it's been a premium cover it up the
Garnier baby cream I swear by that you
guys I know a lot of people have asked
me about it I've used that since like I
think last year and it's an amazing BB
cream like if you have problematic skin
and you're looking for something that
really covers up but it's not super
heavy you need that in your life
humming things so the dealer one is
really nice but the colors kind of off
on me so I'm hoping that this color will
work a little bit better for me all
right stinky with a cosmetics trend
because like I said we just got them I
got the infamous bye-bye under-eye full
coverage waterproof concealer I think
this has been right throughout for like
years on YouTube I've heard so many good
things about it you get huge - I got the
color neutral medium it is very light so
if you're kind of tan like me neutral
medium or a step above would be perfect
for you neutral medium is definitely for
the people who want more of a
highlighting effect underneath their
eyes now this product I will probably be
returning this is the it cosmetics by
light pours pour list finish HD micro
powder this is a very fine powder and it
really does make you look poreless but I
have an issue with the fact that I feel
like it moves my foundation I'm the type
of person who I always pack my powders
on I never rub I've never had a problem
with my Estee Lauder foundation moving
on my skin with any kind of powder but I
had my Estee Lauder on and my pro
longwear concealer on and I wanted to
set everything with this and it just
moved around and you couldn't see my
rosacea and it really annoyed me because
you can't put cream over powder again so
it was like I had this red spot so I
take everything back off and I tried it
twice and it did at the same time but
I'm just not loving this maybe if you
have like perfect skin and don't care if
your foundation mousse you would like
this but I had verse Asia I don't have
time to be putting on powders that make
my foundation move so this little guy
will probably be going back as soon as
possible also got three things from the
NYX matte lipstick line I don't know I
guess these are new shades they had like
their own little dislike everything in
NYX so I got three different shades of
course two of them are nudes because I
can't live without them this first one
is called spirit and this is definitely
more of a pinky nude I like this one a
lot be great with a really really smoky
eye this one is definitely my favorite
color though this isn't the color sable
it's like a tan nude
it's just a really warm nude I like this
one a lot
these are definitely my favorite kind of
nudes and then I decided to get this pop
of color this is called street cred and
that's what it looks like it'll be
really pretty for spring and summer so
that's the color right there they are
super super pigmented I'm more stable on
my lips a couple times I don't know
they're like it's like they're creamy
matte but I don't know if I like the way
they feel on my lips just yet I'm still
kind of trying them out but I like the
color so hopefully I can find a way to
wear them and love them and then the
last thing I got from Ulta was this
Lauren Geller lip gloss this was like a
random buy like this was like this most
random I ever I just saw it at new house
gonna love it it's the color drenched
lip gloss in milkshake this goes with
sable from NYX so well I absolutely love
this nude gloss do you see that right
there super pigmented so going on to Mac
I kind of had a Mac kick I don't know
what it was but I just wanted to try
like so many different things so I went
in store and also purchased some stuff
online so I'm going to show you the
online stuff first and I've already put
some of the things in the palettes so
first off I'll show you the eyeshadows
that I got I got two new ones
to me got the color shroom which is a
gorgeous highlighting color and I'm
wearing that today and I really do love
it it is absolutely stunning and then it
also got the color roll I love this
color right here because it reminds me
of orange by Mac it's just a lot lighter
so it's more wearable I love oranges and
reds anything like that on brown eyes
and this is right up my alley I freaking
love this color like it's gonna be worn
a lot so that is rule right there is so
pretty
if you're really self-conscious about
wearing orange on your eyes I think roll
will definitely be the way to go and to
other eyeshadows I got for some reason I
thought I didn't have this color but I
did so
be going back this is in the color red
brick love the shade I didn't realize I
had in my other palette but I do and
then I had to buy a backup a brown
script because I actually broke mine so
yeah I love Brown script absolutely
stunning just a must-have from Mac I
think everybody and their mom has talked
about this I think I've used this since
I think it was like 2012 I've been using
this so I definitely love Brown script a
lot okay moving on to everything in this
palette everything in here is new I did
have this palette for a while and I just
finally filled it up so let's move on to
the pro these are all pro shades I
believe this one's pro 2 these are all
approach days these are all the pros
shaping powders I got the color
accentuate emphasize and this color
right here is called bone beige it's
just a lighter kind of tan color I'm
thinking this would be good for
contouring I'm not sure it is a little
light but we'll just have to see
probably in the summer time it's not
going to be good maybe in the winter
time I don't like this we will see and
then moving onto these blushes we have
salsa rose which is a pro color style
another pro color and I believe this one
is pro 2 once this blush came in the
belt I knew I was going to love it this
is in the color cantaloupe I'm obsessed
with it I'm wearing it right now on my
cheeks and this is just my color if I
had to have a blush that was named after
me it would be this color so cantaloupe
I know it's going to be one of my new
favorites and these are all so pigmented
and beautiful I love them
i tried to use emphasize today it's a
little too white for me definitely when
I'm tan I'm not not gonna be able to
wear it I'll have to mix them with
something but it is really pretty it's
just super white so just be aware of
that if you're wanting to purchase this
and the extent you ate is really nice
it's not as light so you I can
definitely set my under eye with that
way got all those shades and one
to try some of the shaping powders and
the pro blushes cuz heard a lot of great
things about them and then I did get
this Pro Longwear eyeliner because I've
heard these are better for you if you
have oily eyelids I was gonna get the
black Pro Longwear eyeliner but since I
have my NARS one I just passed on that
so this is in the color power line and
I'm obsessed with this shade what do you
call this like an antique gold I would
say so I think it's a little really
pretty on the water line and smudge
underneath the lower lash line just to
really pop now we're gonna move on to
the things that I got from the MAC store
again I was just roaming around the
store and I was like picking things up
like I don't know why I want to show you
I got three new brushes so first two
I've actually already use these the
first one I got is a 266 brush which
just looks like this this is great for
your brows you can see how angled it is
really nice and then I got this one I'm
obsessed with this brush I see why
everybody raves about it see max 208
which is an eyeliner brush as you can
see I have used it and I love it it's so
amazing when you're working with gel
liner if you're a beginner you need a
brush like this because it's gonna make
it a lot easier because it's so thin and
precise it's perfect so definitely check
out the Mac 208 and then I don't really
know why I got this brush it was just in
this cute package and I love doing fiber
brushes so I was like hey I like you so
it's just a short-handled brush this is
the number 187 and it's just a duo fiber
brush I don't know
I like Mac brushes a lot they're really
soft and really nice even though I do
use Sigma brushes all the time since
they are more affordable I do like Mac
brushes as well so yeah I just want to
pick that up but I want to kind of like
some pink hair ish things I dig at this
Mac oil control lotion and I've never
tried anything like this I did use the
max confined zone for a long time if you
guys watch some of my videos from last
year I always use that as a primer so if
you're gonna have to try this out since
that didn't break me out I figured I
could give this a go like I said it's
the oil control lotion
actually put this on the back of my hand
and just spread it around and it's super
like creamy but once it sets it's not
greasy at all but it still feels really
really smooth so I was just kind of
feeling that area of my hand when I was
roaming around Mac after it's set and I
kind of just fell in love with it so I
figured I would go ahead and give this a
try you know for my oily skin girl I'm
gonna let you know if it works or not
and then I also got this Mac prep and
prime of vibrancy vibrancy eye primer
and this just intrigued me I feel like
I'm always looking for stuff for
underneath my eyes and I figured it'd be
a great primer for concealer I did put
this on the back of my hand it has very
very very fine glitter but you can't
tell you can't even feel it on your skin
it just adds a nice glow underneath your
under eyes so I think I'm gonna like
this a lot I'm all about trying new
things and letting you guys know what I
think because this is a makeup Channel
it's all about trying new things and
finding fun new products and I got this
powder because I've been eyeing this
whole CC line for Mac for a while and
they didn't have the yellow to the
primer so I ended up just getting the
powder because the girl said she really
didn't like this for her redness and she
said that she actually set her makeup
with this so and it looks like a really
nice finely milled powder so I'm excited
to try this out see if the helps with
any redness moving on to stuff from the
newest line I think it's the Playland
collection I believe so I could never
remember the things in them but I got a
couple things from that line and the
first thing is this lipstick called
toying around and I saw this and I was
just like I have to have that I have to
try it I have to have it it is so
beautiful so this is what it looks like
it is just stunning and I figured first
spring and summer it's just oh my god
it's so beautiful that's what it looks
like right there and I'm just obsessed
with it it's so pretty
she's a beautiful coral shade I'm like
in love with this color I think it's
absolutely stunning and then I got two
lip glasses from the collection I've got
the lots of laughs I think I wanted the
nude
from the collection but it's like sold
out everywhere so I wasn't able to get
it but this is the kind of pinky
lipgloss if I hold it back here you can
kind of tell but it's like a pinky lip
gloss it's really really pretty very
pigmented
I love Mac lip glasses if you do not
like sticky lip glosses you will not
like Mac's lip glasses but they will
last a lot longer on you than like a
normal lip gloss will so that's it right
there it's just a really pretty kind of
hot baby pink it's really stunning so
and then I also got to be color limit up
which is an orange lip glass I figured
since I'm not a big fan of orange
lipsticks because I feel like they make
my teeth look super yellow that I would
get this lip gloss and just try it out
so it is a very true orange lip glass
but I think it's gonna look really
pretty in the summer time like either by
itself or over a nude gloss just to kind
of amp it up a little bit okay guys so
that is it for this haul like I said I
just didn't really go shopping that much
in New York so when I came home I just
kind of went haywire and made up for it
so I know I haven't filmed a makeup
tutorial in a while I am filming a
couple tomorrow I'm going to be doing a
few makeup tutorials and also my
routines like eyebrow routine and like
foundation routine I'm probably gonna
combine those into one video for you
guys just to kind of get them out of the
way
and yeah so I don't know if you guys can
tell but I kind of did a bolder brow
today and I'm loving it again I missed
the bolder brows so yeah I'll be doing
it 212 for you guys
very soon this week or next week it'll
be yeah but lots of makeup tutorials and
reviews coming your ways I had when I
was at IMATS I had a few first
impression requests so I'm gonna try to
get more first impressions out for you
