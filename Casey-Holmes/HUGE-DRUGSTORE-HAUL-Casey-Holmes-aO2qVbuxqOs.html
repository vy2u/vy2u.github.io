sorry isn't forever since I've put up a
new video I've been going crazy but if
you guys don't know I haven't been
posting on my vlog channel so if you
haven't seen any of my vlogs from the
past couple weeks then check it out down
below in the description box and go
subscribe and it's just fun to kind of
put up vlogs and I've been vlogging some
more and I have to edit some more but
right now
or focus on the main channel and we're
focused on an exciting thing because I
went to Target last night hold on where
it where's the logo for less so I ended
up going to Tori last night and buying
it like the whole makeup aisle so I
decided to show you guys because then
this stuff is like things have never
heard of I have not been to the
drugstore and so long for anything so if
there's something in particular I should
try and let me know in the comments
below
there is one pallet and then I don't
have in this bag that I did purchase it
was the Laura or not Laura the L'Oreal
nudes palette is the first one it's
somewhere in some bags in another room
but yeah I'm going to show you guys a
couple things I got first off I'm going
to show you some things I got online
from a site these lashes that I get are
like five dollars apiece and I really
really like them I'll leave it in the
description box below
but it's where I get my Koko lashes I'm
wearing Koko lashes right now and
goddess they are my absolute favorite
so I got five backup pairs of these so
that's what those look like I got five
pairs of those I also got these called
Ariel which remind me of the aisle or
ones that I talked about a while back
that I got from Ulta that I cannot find
again I really really like them so I got
a couple pairs of those and then the
last pair that I got a few of are these
Misha lashes which I featured in my get
ready with me video if you didn't see it
I'll leave it down below but I like
these for what I'm doing a more natural
look and I still want lashes so I'll use
these and I like them a lot I think
they're really really nice though oh and
another thing
as I from the website is this la pro
concealer they didn't have a lot of
shades less like in the lighter shades
so I got that one of the lightest shades
which this is a light ivory but it
doesn't really look that light but we'll
see and I got a darker shade which is
nude so I figured I can mix the match to
make my custom shade so I'm excited to
try this out because I've heard this
talked about first such a long time but
I've never picked it up the rest of this
stuff is all that I got from Target so
let's just get into it
Odin on her lashes okay so the first
thing I got is this Sonia Kashuk Sahara
Desert highlighter this just intrigued
me like look at how pretty that is
I have to stop making Miranda references
but this is um such a pretty highlighter
it just looked gorgeous in the packaging
one thing that kind of threw my office
it says do not apply in lip area which
kind of like does I mean I can't
highlight my Cupid's bow like what does
that even mean so I don't know why it
says that but it's just so pretty that I
wanted to see what it was life in the
packaging is just gorgeous as well so
let's swatch it on camera for the first
time so that's what looks like look at
how beautiful that is
and don't look at my desk it's like a
super dirty ooh
that is gorgeous
oh my god that is so pretty
oh my gosh it's just like a golden
highlighter with a little bit of coral a
little bit of pink in there but more on
the gold inside oh that is so pretty I'm
so excited to put this on my face I
can't wait this is random but it's here
I got a necklace from Target I've been
loving this kind of antique gold look
and I'll feel like the silver and stuff
and this is really pretty so thoughtful
okay moving on I have got a lot of lip
products so I'm just gonna go ahead
about them first are these new
Maybelline lipstick so that I purchased
that I'm loving and I'm wearing two
right now so the two that I'm wearing
the first one is a matte one and this is
in clay crush and I really like this
shoe don't mind my self tan rest are
just self tan today so I haven't washed
it off but this is in clay crushed and I
love this so much I used this as the
first color on my lips and it's just
really really pretty
a very nice matte shade I love it look
at that these Maybelline lipsticks are
amazing they're very creamy and very
pigmented they're just beautiful and
then this is from the newest like a
nudes collection I guess that they have
and this is in truffle tease and I have
this one on top of that so there's
truffle tease right there it's really
pretty this is more of a beige nude has
a little more ash into it but I really
like it a lot and then this one is
touchable taupe which is a beautiful
beautiful topi nude I love this color
and wore this today - I wore three
lipsticks today don't judge me
don't judge me then I also got two of
the new covergirl lipsticks they they
look like this they kind of have like
what what is this like rosy packaging
rose gold packaging I don't know what
color this is
oh my oh my my stuff cameras are so bad
so this is what the covergirl ones look
like but this first one is sultry Sienna
this is gorgeous this is like that Kylie
Jenner moggy nude you know everybody
loves it so that's it right there it's
really pretty and then I also got
caramel kiss which I don't remember what
this looks like let's see so then this
one's just a light pink nude something I
wouldn't wear everyday it's a little bit
splotchy but if you wanted to lighten up
a loop color that would be great to have
and then I also got some of these or I
got all of these Rimmel show-off let the
velvet lipstick things and I got all the
colors so the first one is in the shade
Apollo which is just a nude
and i swatched these last night and they
didn't really dry Matt so let me know
what you think of these down below in
the comments because from what I saw
they didn't dry Matt like I would think
they would try they just I mean they
were I don't know they weren't Matt I
don't know let me know what you guys
have experienced with these you guys to
me they didn't dry so I don't know but
this one is in the shade of burning lava
I love this color it's like a brick red
that's so pretty I love that and and I
also got this which is more of a pink
color this is atomic rose that's so
stinkin pretty
so that's atomic rose right there these
are very creamy creamy and pigmented I
like them a lot but they just didn't dry
matte on me which I mean I don't really
mind cuz I love the color so much in the
formula but I just wanna know if I'm not
the only one this one is in the shade
orange ology and it's an orange
straight-up orange and then this last
one is my personal favorite this is in
the men torque matte I feel like
somebody was gonna make fun of me for
not saying that right I just I feel it I
feel it coming and oh I love this color
this is so we great for summertime this
is like a great all year-round color oh
that's so pretty so yeah those were the
Rimmel show-off Lymphoma it's very very
pretty very humid Tim I like them so far
so I'm moving on I've got some NYX lip
products these two things I'm really
excited about this is the NYX simply
nude lip cream this one's in the shade I
love this it's not stable this is in the
color stable and that's what it looks
like right there gorgeous
you can probably see a trend with the
nudes they're like really mommy or a
little bit more on the top side I just I
love my darker nude someone favorite and
then I also have this one which is an
espresso which is again going along the
same lines this one's a little bit
lighter though but I like it a lot so
that one's espresso
okay and then I did get three of the
Knicks and tents butter glosses this one
in tres leches I was not able to find so
these longest time and I found it and I
have it on my lips right now over top of
those Maybelline lipsticks and I love it
which I look at it it's so pretty so I
love tryst like Jace I love the formula
of these it's amazing so creamy very
pigmented this one is in the shade a
sorbet this is the color I would
definitely mix with a lipstick not
something that I would feel comfortable
wearing by itself just because it's so
light but it is a very gorgeous shape
and I like it for the summer time and
then this one is just a fun a purple I
have not seen a lip gloss this color
like this pretty of a purple in a really
long time and I just loved it this is in
the shade a very shrewd ole so I just
love how unique if this purple is it's
very bright vibrant it's very vibrant
and beautiful it's just something
different that I have not seen and it's
absolutely gorgeous but I love that okay
moving on to other things I got two
primers from NYX where's that paratus I
got the waterproof eyebrow primer which
I thought was really cool and great for
summer and then I also got a waterproof
eyeshadow primer I want to see how this
works hopefully it'll be okay for my
oily lids
I'm very oily eyelid so I stick to my
same primer routine but hopefully this
one will be okay as long as it doesn't
make my eyelids a little bit more oily
will be fine this has like a shininess
to is it will just stay I'll try it out
and then I got a lot of things when they
actually I have no more lip product this
is the Rimmel lasting finished color
rush long-lasting intense color bomb in
the shade girl I don't know
oh drags me nude they're about to drive
me crazy and I'll go find that name just
another nude you know and then the day
another mood not those kind of nudes but
these kind of news
and then I also got the NYX tinted brow
mascara I'm all about brows right now if
you guys watch me for a while you know I
love the benefit gimme brow but I also
love the old tub brow gel it's amazing
and it's a great dupe for that but I
wanted to try this next one because it
just didn't trick me I'm all about it
I'm all about finding more brow products
I want to see what it looks like so this
is a bigger size the one is a little bit
bigger than the Gimme brow and the old
two one but I think it'll be okay this
is in the shade brunette
all over NYX I got the NYX micro brow
pencil which a lot of people have been
saying is similar to the Anastasia brow
Wiz so precise blendable and smudge
resistant which is all the things they
want in our brow products this is again
in the shade don't know if I said it but
this is in the shade espresso right
there it looks like a perfect color for
me right now
love it okay and then two more things
from NYX I got the Enix tricks Joel a
gel pencil liner um all very cool they
have cool little pictures on the side
showing you what different wings liners
you can do but this is what it looks
like
I like mixes packaging on all this new
stuff I think it's really chic and
pretty it's I mean it's like the same
old Nick's packaging but I just think it
looks really nice let's see let's do
does this wind up like what oh and its
retractable brownie points brownie
points okay so let's see there we go
that's the swatch right there barely
touched my hand I press down harder
that's what you get very nice I'm
excited to try it things like this kind
of make me nervous though because I do
have watery eyes so the last thing for
NYX is this NYX epic black brow no not
brows sorry
this is the NYX epic breath this is a
NYX epic black mousse liner and what
intrigued me about this is it says an
innovative a fluffy a lightweight
formula packed with the blackest black
pigment you've ever experienced glides
on like butter and dries matte
waterproof
finish this miner is epic flag so mole
about that life so that's what the jar
looks like really cute all right let me
just gonna brush can somebody give me a
brush please okay let me take this
little brush it is really creamy - whew
very black that is like but I am in your
face okay so the next thing that I got
is this Maybelline brow define and fill
duo and it says naturally full brows
define pencil and the filling powder
what oh how interesting that is weird
defining pencil and filling powder okay
so it comes like this y'all don't mind
myself Tanis right now and on one side
you have the pencil what just look at it
it's really nice and creamy I like that
it's right there and then the other side
you have a powder it's so crazy okay
that is crazy that is crazy if this
works out really well I will let you
guys know because that's like a
time-saving product and just a great way
to have everything in one so hopefully
that works out really well it doesn't
look like a lot of powder came out on my
hand well there it goes
there goes right there that's really
really cool so I'm excited to try this
out the only thing that's missing this
is fully but what else are you gonna put
this fully and then the last product I
got is this Revlon brow fantasy pencil
and gel so you have a pencil side and
then you have the gel side so I love
that the instructional grants are really
branching out and trying new things it's
really making me happy so that's the
pencil right there very creamy and then
this one is the gel very nice so I'm
excited to try all these out okay and
then the last thing I got was this
Jergens natural glow instant Sun
flawless natural looking color instantly
and deep bronze and I want to try this
out because it is new and all about
trying a new self tanners so hopefully
I'll really like this it's as it dries
in 60 seconds which it's pretty good so

works out I would definitely you guys

domes are loving the new rug that I got
