drugstore haul I went to Walgreens
tonight and I found so much stuff I did
go in there thinking I was gonna buy all
this stuff but literally when I walked
in it was like heaven came down on
Walgreens and put all the new drugstore
items out so I was so excited and I
wanted to try a bunch of different
things it's been a while since the
drugstore has really came out with a
bunch of different stuff that you know
was exciting to try now the first brand
I want to talk about is went wild and
they had so much stuff out like it's
insane such exciting products I mean oh
it was gorgeous but there was a lot of
different things in the Fergie
collection and also in like just the
regular went wild collection so from the
forget collection I did get this wet and
wild Fergie BB cream it says there's an
eighth one beauty balm I got the color
deep which looked fine I did do a little
bit on my hand just to see the color and
it looks like it's gonna be a great
color for me when I'm nice and self-tan
another thing from wet and wild is this
from the forget collection as well and
it's the take on the day mattifying
powder so this is basically a
translucent setting powder to make your
makeup nice and matte so if you have
oily skin you would probably want to try
this out and then I also got two
eyeshadow palettes for my mouth this
first one is the naked truth that they
had a bunch of different shades like
this reminds me of the Maybelline
palette looks like such a gorgeous
palette I mean you have to match aids in
here you have a matte kind of cream
color and a matte dark brown you can go
this palette for so many different looks
and then I dig it this one it's kind of
out of my comfort zone but this isn't
all it looks for the most part they look
all matte maybe a couple or sheet-like
have a sheen to them but for the most
part they're all mat this is called
poster child and it has really gorgeous
kind of bright fun shades I think this
would be fun for spring and summer so I
wanted to pick it up I mean they're
pretty affordable so I figured why not
just go ahead and get it now because who
knows they might be sold out you know a
couple Issa now now I did only get one
thing from Revlon because I know that
they had that new foundation out in
their new concealers but I heard that
the foundation is definitely for more
normal to dry skin so I didn't want to
give it a chance until I saw more
reviews on it and I've actually heard
that from a couple different people so I
just didn't want to purchase it because
it is pretty expensive and I just wanted
to kind of skip out
but the one thing I did want to try is
this Revlon Photoready skin lines
two-faced illuminator I'm mostly
interested in trying this out with like
my foundation and just mixing it in
because I don't think it would create a
super highlighted effect on the top of
my cheekbones so I'm excited to mix this
in with my foundation and see what it
does I also forgot this product from
went wild this is the wet n wild vicious
varnish high shine lip stain this is in
giving realness and I was so interested
in this because first off it's a nude
whenever I go out and purchase a bunch
of different items especially lip
products I like to mainly get nudes just
because I know I'm gonna wear them the
most but this had a no shimmer or
anything it looks like a nice cream
color so I'm gonna be swatching this for
you guys and seeing how I like it
okay moving on to covergirl I have two
lipsticks this is from their like
pastels collection or something I got
the color cream which I'm wearing cream
on my lips right now the only thing I'm
not a big fan of about these is the
smell but that's something I can get
past this one's called 258 honey ID I
don't know it's Joanne a ye D and this
is like a gorgeous pinky nude so pinky
nudes nudes I want him I also got this
covergirl trublend fixstick it actually
uses a couple times already this isn't
light 5/7 and I like this for underneath
my eyes if I'm doing kind of more of a
natural look and I don't really want to
put back pull more on I'll just put this
underneath my eyes and blend it out it's
super easy to blend out and it does have
pretty great coverage so I do like this
so far I mainly got this item because of
a lot of you can asking my opinion on it
and it's the covergirl bombshell mascara
and I've just kind of been on the fence
about it because the packaging is so
freaking big like it's driving me nuts
just looking at now like is it necessary
for it to be that large it's kind of
ridiculous but you know I've seen the
commercials and a lot of you have asked
me you know what I thought of it and of
course I didn't have it so I'm ready to
try this out maybe in a first impression
Friday and let you guys know what I
think now the last thing I got from
covergirl I have tried this out as well
this is the covergirl true magic skin
Perfector and this is like the
translucent kind of cream powder or the
cream thing
I don't necessarily know how to describe
this if you've seen the Mallee product
that's like this it's kind of like a I
don't know it's like a silicone II
creamy I don't know how to describe it
but Malley has something like this as
well you can find her like on QVC and
stuff I actually did purchase that one
product from Ally and I hated it it left
like a film on top of my makeup and it
just did not look good at all so I
really regret buying that and I don't
really like this it's basically the same
thing it leaves that film on top of my
makeup it doesn't really make me mad it
just feels really weird like it feels
like I'm piling stuff on my skin even
though this is like a clear transition
shade it just adds this weird film on
top of my foundation and I do not like
it okay next I did get a new foundation
from Neutrogena this is a neutrogenia
nourishing a long wear makeup it says
it's a tone correcting complex and it
says 12-hour makeup instantly erases the
look of skin imperfections clinically
proven to make skin tone look even in
just four weeks even without makeup
that's a claim right there it says light
weight natural looking coverage resists
heat and humidity so I did get two
colors because you guys know I do self
tan so I'm always trying to find my
perfect shade and whatever color doesn't
match will be going back
moving on to Rimmel we're all had a
great matte line out so the first thing
I got from Rimmel is this day matte
primer and I'm pretty pumped to try this
out now I have put it on and I don't
notice yet if it keeps me matte I'll
have to put it to the test soon it does
have kind of a different consistency
it's more of a cream and it's kind of a
thicker weird cream I personally didn't
think that this would be a cream product
but it is and like I said I've only
tried it once today and I don't
necessarily know how about it yet but
once I do figure it out I will let you
guys know and then I did pick up their
stay matte foundation this is the liquid
mousse foundation again I don't know
what shade I will be against like
sitting there testing it out in the
store so I will try these out probably
do a first impression and let you guys
know what I think and whatever
doesn't work we'll be going back okay
now I did it to three things from
l'oréal the first thing is this L'Oreal
True Match mineral powder and I got the
color mm buff beige and I'm wearing it
today and I do like it it's a pretty
fine powder I think it looks really
really gorgeous it's easy to blend out
and I think it does provide a little bit
more coverage so I like that and let me
tell you the claim go way up to 16 hours
of fresh true color without oil
breakthrough I haven't had my makeup on
for that one but I will totally do an
update for you guys and let you know
what I think of this product the last
thing I got from L'Oreal is probably not
interesting to a lot of you but I've
been looking for a black glitter and
this one's really pretty it's called
rough around the edges and I just really
liked the shade I also got this from
L'Oreal it's the visible lift CC
concealer and I got it in light it
looked really interesting to me I wanted
to try it I also wanted to try the CC
cream light for your face but a very
light weight on it since I did just get
the wet and wild ones so I just held off
on that and got the concealer and I'm
really excited to try it out because
they had like a roller ball on the end I
believe yeah and it looks like it's
gonna feel really good underneath your
eyes cuz the Garnier one you'll remember
that when it came out I had like the
roller ball I'm hoping this will feel
good oh yeah it's cold this is gonna
feel good underneath eye so I'm excited
to try that out it basically looks like
the little garne one so hopefully it has
really great coverage okay so the last
thing is Maybelline I know Maybelline
came out with some blush sticks but I'm
not a fan of blushes in a stick form or
cream blushes I just don't like them at
all but I didn't cup a couple things
so Maybelline a baby skin instant pore
eraser and I know a bunch of people are
saying this is a dupe for benefits
Porefessional I've tried this a couple
times and I don't necessarily think it's
a dupe I think it's a great product but
I need to try it out a little bit more
before sit here and say it's a complete
dupe for it the benefits luxe like I
love that benefit primer so it's gonna
take a lot for me to you know say this
is exactly like it I don't know if you
guys want to see a review on this after
I tried it a couple more times then let
me know in the comments below and I'll
do that for you I just don't have a
straight answer for you right now and
you
try it a little bit more okay and then
the last thing I got two lipsticks from
Maybelline but oh my gosh they have so
many gorgeous nudes no matter what skin
tone you have you need to go check out
these nude lipsticks because they
literally have one for everyone super
dark nudes super pale nudes I mean hello
I'm a nude junkie so I was like oh stop
I'm so excited I did get two colors the
first one is blushing beige and this
one's more of a lighter nude it's not
super super nude where you're washed out
but it's definitely a gorgeous kind of
peachy nude from what I can see I can't
see cuz alive yeah it's definitely more
of a peachy pink nude which those are
kind of like my favorites too but I do
like more of the brown nudes as well and
this one I got is new to lust and this
one's definitely a darker nude I love
love love darker nudes let me see what
this one looks like because I can't see
right now this one's just like basically
a shade above that one and it's more on
the brown side like it's definitely more
of a darker nude that you could wear
like on a day to day basis so that is it
for my drugstore haul I hope you guys
enjoyed it I love the drugstore and
finding different things so the fact
that all these people came out with so
many new products is so exciting to me
and yeah like I said in the beginning if
you want any reviews or first
impressions on these products leave them

everything that I mentioned in this
video in the description box per usual
