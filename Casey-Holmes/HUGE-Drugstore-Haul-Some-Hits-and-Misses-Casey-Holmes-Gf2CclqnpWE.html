today I asked you guys in my last
drugstore video where I tried out some
new products so I will have rate down
below if you wanna check it out but I
asked you guys if you wanted to see a
dress store haul to give that video a
thumbs up and it got quite a bit of
thumbs up so I figured I would give the
people what they want and do a drugstore
haul I had purchased a lot of stuff and
some of those I have tried out so I'll
give you a real review on it some of it
I have not I personally can't get enough
of drugstore hauls I think they're just
so fun I think you guys know how
obsessed I am with drugstore right now
it's just like one my favorite things I
want to tell you guys really quickly
what I'm wearing before we get started
my bronzer that I have on however my
faces think you look like a garage woman
this is from Physicians Formula it's the
butter bronzer and it's the darkest
shade there are two shades I found them
online so I just got the darkest one the
highlights that I have all over my face
that's making me glow is my spotlight
palette and pearl that I created with
Smashbox cosmetics this is the LA girl
the mofongo this matte flat finish
pigment gloss from la girl and it's in
the shade dreamy this is drugstore as
well love this but anyways if you guys
want to see all of the goodies that I
got and just keep watching and don't
forget to subscribe before you leave so
you don't miss out on any of my video
and let's go ahead and get started with
these products okay
so I did get a little package from
countries which I was super surprised
about I did not know that they sent out
PR but they sent me something and I was
like thank you so much I'm so excited so
they sent over three of these shine
appeal fluid lipsticks and they're
really pretty colors the one to the very
right is going to be great for summer
just so pretty so I'm going to select
this one for you right now this is one
of them so this is one like a really
pigmented lip gloss and this one is in
the shade what a melon
what AM L is the funny name so that's my
color right there
and then the lightest pink color is
called meet you at the barbie and then
this purple one is Mary berry and then
they sent over these Catrice cosmetics
eyeshadow pens wow I've never okay
yeah so these are eye shadow pens they
just look like that I think that's
really really pretty look at that that
is gorgeous so
ones in the shade the shade gold
McDonald you have more of like a white
silver one which is right there this was
in the shade it been in pur liner oh my
gosh you guys you got to look at that
name that ages me I promise you that's
the name right there I don't really know
what that was supposed to meet and then
they have this more bronze one and this
one's called brown to earth so those are
really cool thank you to Catrice for
sending those over and then I got this
elf stippling brush I actually ordered a
few more elf brushes to try out for you
guys but I saw this and I was like yes
got to have it because we all know I
love my sibling brushes and this one
just looks promising it's a little mini
one which I actually enjoy like for
traveling and stuff it's very tiny and
easy to take with you it's super soft so
it's really really soft you could
possibly use it for highlighter if you
wanted to yeah it's just a regular
stippling brush you just want to try it
out and see how it works out for me so
this one I actually tried out in my last
video it's the makeup revolution ultra
eyes contour light and shade palette I
think this is really great has good
pigmentation it's all that shade now
these shadows can be a little bit harder
to blend out they're little choppy so
just take your time with it make sure to
use nice fluffy brushes and you should
be okay but I think for a drugstore
product it's really nice and this black
is super black as well
next up I have this on my face today
it's a physician's formula bronze
booster and I love this this is just a
matte sculpting palette so you open it
up you have three shades you have a
light kind of pale yellow it's really
really pale yellow then you have a nice
acetone and in a more warm tone I've
been mixing these two together to get my
contour shade and then on the other side
you have a mirror and this brush which I
do really like this brush I think it's a
great drugstore addition to this product
not a lot of Josefa brushes that come
with palettes are great but I think this
is worth keeping and worth trying out I
think it's nice but I've been really
enjoying this I think it blends really
well and it does great
are you down to film a couple videos
with me this weekend - yeah next up is
the LA girl Pro coverage HD foundation
this has really great coverage if you
have dry skin or even normal skin and
you love a luminous foundation I think
you're going to love this personally for
me it did not work out because I am so
oily and this was like a oil slick on my
face but I love the coverage that it has
it is intense and luminous and full
coverage but just uses if you have the
coverage of this and made it into a
matte foundation I'll be all about it
next up is something I have not tried
I'm super excited to test it out it's
the Real Techniques base it's the for
miracle blotting cushions so basically
you just get to blot your skin with this
it says to use it dry I'm glad that they
put that there because you know
sometimes we get sponges and we're like
should we use is dry or wet so I like
that I put used dry right there it's
just a simple little added touch that I
really like I said smooth and perfect
with cushion compact because ideal for
liquid foundation or Co what these multi
okay my first impression when I saw this
is I thought it was kind of like the
what is it the Beauty Blender water like
the blogging thing sponge but they spend
these multifunctional miracle blotting
Christian's create smooth and matte
finish use dried Avalon foundation
smooth creases or blue areas okay so you
can blot it this or blah oily areas next
up is a new favorite I actually really
like this a lot it's the L'Oreal
infallible paint brush this one's in the
shade 230 I'm guessing yeah I guess it's
in the shade 230 I've only used one
shade out of here which is this one and
I really liked it it give a nice rosy
tint to the cheek I'm going to have to
be really light handed these two right
here this one I think it's going to be
great this actually reminds me of pinks
women by Mac but these two right here I
feel like I'm gonna have to be really
careful with because they are pretty
pigmented as you can see and I don't
want to be you know looking too crazy
you know I already look crazy enough
sometimes I think this is going to be
great this did blend out really well and
it applied smooth on the skin so I'm
liking it and I like that it's super
compact and easy to travel with
I feel like I'm going to be saying that
a lot in this video because I'm going to
traveling a lot
more I have some meetup coming up so
stay tuned at the Chicago meetup coming
up and I'm really excited about it so if
you want to check that out I will leave
it down below and I hope to see you guys
there
next up we do have the LA girl Pro face
HD definition matte pressed powder I got
the shade soft honey
it says long-lasting oil controlling
powder mattifying finish for a radiant
look helps cover blemishes and
imperfections and it says paraben and
fragrance free and is the mirror and
sponge included so can't wait to try
this out I love powders I love doing
that and I feel like this colors really
great when I'm nice and soft and I got
quite a lot of stuff from la girl so
these next two items are also from them
it is the quads and one of them is
completely matte which I love this one
is in the shade urbanized I mean is that
not the most beautiful polity of
everything I think it's beautiful this
is not as intense as I wish it was but I
mean you can make this palette work if
you wanted to try it out and then the
other palette that I have is this one
right here this is an idolized this one
has some more shimmery shades in it as
you can see and I think these are great
I think that the pigmentation could be a
little bit better so far this is my
favorite shade right here because it's a
nice warm transition shade but I tried
this one out I think it's great so far I
can't wait to try this one out was like
the shimmer shades in it and the really
deep brown in this one it just depends
on how they work I mean you can always
get this one matte palette and then the
shimmery one and mix and match them
together and see how they work but I
will keep you guys updated but so far I
was pretty impressed by that palette I
also got two blushes one of them I'm
wearing right now which the one I'm
wearing now is called just playful first
off I love the packaging of these I
think they're so a sleek and beautiful
I'm just really in love with it and it's
a nice big plastic package and then this
is the color dam right now like I said
it's just playful I think it's the
perfect everyday blush color I think it
is stunning it's like a nude mall color
I love this so much I went on the skin
really smooth it blend it out really
well and then I do have more of a
shimmery one which is called just
glowing it does have a little bit of
shimmer in there so you can see it right
there it's not like super shimmery it's
like a nice sheen I would say so to me
this looks like a nice peachy nude with
a little bit of shine to it I think it's
beautiful very excited
that I'm not going to lie when I saw the
little shimmers in here I thought they
were going to be kind of flaky and
glittery but it looks like they just
blend in with the blush and add a nice
little shine to it super pigmented as
well I'll go ahead and swatch this one -
love it
love those colors this is something I
have not tried it is the jcat cushion
compact and it is in the shade medium
beige it just says it's an all-in-one
cushion compact that is great for all
skin types so that's what it looks like
I'll do a wear test or something on this
foundation to let you guys know it was
really affordable so I'm down to try out
affordable foundation more makeup
revolution products these two I was
going to wear today as you can tell by
the packaging but I opened them up and I
was like hell no the first one is this
makeup revolution blushing heart triple
baked bronzer they look like the Too
Faced baked blushes and bronzer as well
which I do love the Too Faced baked
bronzer it's about to fall out this is
what follow just do it just do it I know
you're going to okay so this is a
bronzer and it first I was like okay
this is going to be really pretty it
looks gorgeous online but I just I can't
I can't put that on my face as a bronzer
that's going to be more of a highlighter
if anything I don't even know if it
could be a highlighter because it's so
dark but it's more of like a copper
shimmery bronzer you see that right
there
that's it at the end so it's a copper
shimmer and I just I can't make that
work for me it's just it's not going to
work as a blush or bronzer so might be
returning this oh I hate that sound
I hurt my she's so bad I might be
returning this I just don't like stuff
like that and then the blush is kind of
that same problem where it's really
really shimmery and if I'm going to put
shimmer on my face I like to wait until
I put a highlighter on I mean it is just
shiny I just feel like if I put this on
my face it's going to look too intense
and really accentuate all the texture
and my pores you can see how these two
right here look matte and really nice on
the skin but this one is just like high
shine more of like a highlighter so not
really down for that this is another lip
formula I'm really liking right now is
from Jake at beauty I think I've tried
some other things from them and I really
like their lip products so I decided
is out is the list Finity and that lip
it's a kiss proof lip color this one's
in the color champagne buzz and then
this one is any color bottles left to
right as a cute so I got just color
because I thought to be perfect for
spring and summer it's just so vibrant
and beautiful and these are pigmented
you guys what I'm so pretty and these
lasts all day long they are so
comfortable where they dry down really
nice and matte again this one is in the
shade champagne buzz this one's one of
my favorite shoes we all know I love my
nudes
look at them so pretty well have this
formula highly recommend it I believe
they have quite a few shades but I just
picked up these two because I have a lot
of lip products as it is and then the
next one that I'm wearing now that I
mentioned to you earlier I did get two
shades as well so again the one that I
am wearing now is the shade dreamy very
very pretty I will say it's a little bit
sticky when it's drying and everything
and right now it has a little bit of
tackiness to it but it's not too bad you
know what I mean like for a drugstore
matte lip color it's not terrible I can
deal with it personally
and then the next color that I picked up
is the shade Bazaar and this one just
looks like a nice pink yeah okay I love
that color so that is bizarre right
there very very pretty I love the
applicators of these and I think the
packaging of these two lip colors are
just so beautiful I love the matte black
in the see-through packaging very very
nice
next step is something I have tried and
I really like it it's the LA girl Pro
powder and it is the banana yellow love
this it is a very smooth powder it does
have that yellow tint to it but it's not
too intense and it really does help
highlight the face but set all of that
concealer as well love this easy to dust
away
next up is what I have on my brows right
now it is the makeup revolution brow
pomade in the shade blonde I really
liked it it was very easy to apply very
pigmented as most of you know I did also
get the elf liner and brow product as
well and I really liked that too so
those two might be my new go-to brow
products because I can't pick which one
I like better I really like both of the
color of this one and blend it out
really well and I just think it's great
so definitely check this out if you're
looking for a new paul made this is a
Catrice anti red base it's the prime and
sign
neutralizes redness long-lasting and
hydrating the only thing about these
color correcting primers is like this
one is hydrating so it has to use a
mattifying primer with it but we will
see if it works out I don't usually use
these products very often because I just
use a full coverage foundation but we'll
test it out just to see if it work I
also picked up the number 7 skin
illuminator it's a natural looking
radiance for a beautiful glow I got this
because I figured I can use it on my
chest I got the shade Bron or I just
need this was comparable to my Natasha
de Nonna body glow which I love and
wearing it on the chest right now you
can't really tell but that's what I love
about it it just gives a nice glow to
the skin
now this one's nice but I'm not like
obsessed with it but I feel like if you
want to drugstore alternatives this is a
good way to go it just gives that nice
shimmer to the skin and I really like it
and it's kind of like a cooling
sensation as well more of an affordable
option I would totally check this out
because it's going to do the same thing
it's just not as intense as the Natasha
been on the body glow ok a few more
things I have not tried this outfit is
the Catrice nude illusion loose powder
and it's a matte translucent powder it
says that it's transparent with a soft
focus effect for a flawless long lasting
matte finish without drying out the skin
the ultrafine formula for wearing a loan
or fixing the foundation I detest this
out especially after my video where I
tried out the powder before foundation
thing which is you have not seen that so
check it out down below I'm just going
to be trying that product out with it I
also picked up the essence the false
lashes mascara I don't know I just want
to try it out you know see if this is
like really intense and nice and then I
also got the LA girl line art matte
eyeliner I did do my liner with this on
the outer half but I did touch it up
with my makeup forever ink liner because
this is not as black I feel like it not
a lot of product comes out on the felt
tips it does work and it is matte it's
just more of like a gray black it's not
as black as I want it to be so that's
the coloring just changed in this video
like it is abundantly I did get the LA
girl Pro concealer again this is in the
shade natural I don't know if I love
this yet I still need to try it out a
little bit more just because I feel like
it makes me a little bit more oily
sometimes when I do my concealer in a
triangle shape the concealers if they
don't work for me will make me a little
bit more oily
and just look a little too greasy and
caked up so let me try this a little bit
more and I will let you guys know I've
only used it once but I do I don't hate
it I'm not obsessed with it I got these
two products right here these are the LA
girl metal with lipsticks I'm not going
to lie to you I don't know why I taught
these cuz I never wear like metal lip
colors I don't know I'm more of just
like a matte person or I'll wear a gloss
this is the first one is mache polish ie
that's not looking to you
oh no nananana yeah that's like a Lucy
chunky kind of formula and I don't even
see the metallic feel in it looks Mac to
me and then this one is the shade
smolder that one has a little bit more
of a massage face
I mean there's like a slight sheen to
them this one's definitely more metallic
but I'm not obsessed with the formula so
I probably won't be wearing mean but if
you like metallics lips you do have some
that one's more metallic than anything
again this in the shade smolder and then
the last thing before my camera dies
this is the LA girl strobe light
strobing powder wanted to see if this is
going to be good and that's not bad
that's a really pretty color it's more
of a gold highlighter but I like that
what this is in the shade 50 watt by the
way but alright guys that is it for my
drugstore haul I hope you guys enjoyed
it let me know in the comments what you
guys want to see videos on if you want
me to do a full face of drugstore makeup
