let's just do a hug okay all right I
missed you haha it has been as so long
as since I've sat in front of the camera
to film free bags because if you don't
follow me and if you haven't followed me
for a while I like for the past month I
moved into my new house which I don't
know if you could tell by the background
is it a permanent background it's just
something I kinda threw together so I
could sit down and film for you guys
this beauty room right now is a hot mess
and it's gonna take me a minute to
really get it all put together and to
really clean my house up because there
are boxes everywhere so just bear with
me for now but I really quickly want to
announce as well that I will be at
beautycon in Dallas Texas I believe the
date is March 14th so if you're going to
be in the area I would love it to meet
you I haven't done a meet-and-greet or
anything since last I Matt's in New York
so I'm super excited I will be doing a
meet-and-greet and a panel and I'm
nervous about the panel but it'll be
okay we'll get it together and we'll get
through it
I'm I get nervous when I get in front of
people and like have to speak on stuff
it just makes me nervous but we're gonna
do it and we're gonna have fun so if you
do want to attend Vedic on Dallas I will
leave a link down below where you could
purchase some tickets and like I said I
would love to meet you guys I don't know
the exact times of anything yet but if
you follow me on Instagram and Twitter
and just my social media I'll be sure to
keep you guys updated as I know things
yeah I got a lot of stuff in front of me
I went online on forever 21 I went
through each category on forever 21 to
find certain things I would love and I
found a lot of items so let's just go
ahead and get started with the haul so I
have a lot of tops because I already
have quite a bit of bottoms and it's not
very often that I shop for a lot of
bottoms so a lot of this is tops but I
have a few accessories and other things
to show you guys okay so the first thing
I got is this adorable little chiffon
top and it has this really cute beading
here but I love this it's kind of a crop
top but not really it's really not that
short but I liked it a lot because it's
something easy to just throw on and have
like high-waisted black pants or regular
black pants and I just thought it was
really cute so this is the first top
that I got oh
also about this which I showed it on
Instagram and I just love Forever 21's
pajama sets and it says I don't get boys
but I get shoes yes yes so true well I
got that and that came with the bottoms
which look like this they're really cute
pink ruffles shorts with little shoes on
them and I just loved this set I thought
it was absolutely adorable okay so next
up I got is just really basic but it's a
nice lightweight top and I love the
color combo it's like a gray with a
green of blue in it it's so pretty it's
just a nice kind of breathable top
that'll be great for summertime and I
just love the color combos of it okay so
the next thing I got was this skirt I
thought this was absolutely adorable
this is like in the length skirt and
it's that army green color it has an
elastic band at the back but has a
really nice smooth front and it just has
buttons all the way down which I thought
was really adorable and I just thought
this would be cute in the summer time
with maybe like a white crop top and
some brown wedges so I phone has been
going off my phone's about to die and
I'm so over having a phone right now
that I'm not even gonna charge it but I
thought this would be really cute for
the summertime and I just love this I
think it's adorable
I'm a huge fan of these types of tops I
feel like I have so many of them but I
just I keep buying them because I love
them so this is a white chiffon top with
a gorgeous ruffle and tie detail up at
the top of the neckline and I just love
tops like this they're really feminine
easy to work with and easy to pair so I
got another one and it's white and I
always love wearing white / cream tops
and then another top that I got was this
one it's a button-down with gorgeous
green stripes to go and down and it does
have rolled sleeves and nothing I love
is that it ties here at the bottom which
is super cute and this will be great for
summertime if you can't tell I'm super
ready for spring and summer because Elsa
froze the East Coast like we are all
freezing over here this top is kind of
different I mean it's not really
different it's a basic top but I love
tops like this just to kind of pair with
anything and it's great for the
transition from like winter to spring so
this is a really pretty
kind of like blue-gray top and buns down
halfway and I like the color of this top
it's really nice it's not a v-neck or
scoop neck it's just you know whatever
this is normal and yeah I like this a
lot it's a long sleeve it's really
lightweight so again super cute to pair
with anything you could layer it up or
you could just pair it with like some
white shorts and roll up the sleeves and
have a cute necklace and it'd be good to
go
this top I saw and I was like oh my gosh
it's just this would be so cute for a
country concert and it has like that
Victorian neckline I love high neck tops
like this and it just has a crochet
detailing all the way around so it's a
really breathable top it'll be great for
the hot summer months and yeah I just
think this is adorable like I mean it's
it's so cute now this song kind of makes
me feel like a lumberjack but I'm really
digging it I don't know why it's just
this plaid top like this and just a
regular applied top and I'd like to I
don't know which is some shorts it'd be
a great top to just kind of throw on and
run some errands in and then this top I
don't know I think it's called eyelet
whenever it's got so many cutouts
throughout I can't remember but this
tops it really gorgeous like dark taupe
shade and I liked it a lot I love the
cutouts in it and this will look really
pretty like a breath of Brac bullet no
really pretty with a brat oh my god this
would look really pretty with a black
bralette and I liked it a lot it's just
make you I loved basic tops like this
there are my favorite this one is again
from the transition for winter to spring
and this is a gorgeous gray top it kind
of has that faux silk in the front and I
love the shape of it it's really nice
and feminine and it does gather at the
bottom and yeah it's a really nice
lightweight top and I thought it was
gorgeous and then I'll have anything
this color so you see how I can sell
that bad boy and then I got a few of
basic tops from forever 21 as well these
are all like crop top but they're a
little bit longer crop tops so this one
is just a gorgeous army green color and
this has the cuffs please last year I
was really big on the cuff sleeves and
I'm back into it this year I just think
it's really cute so I got this
one from forever obviously so this one
has a little bit longer sleeves and has
a little pocket since the burgundy top
with like white stripes and a cute
little pocket so again great to pair
with some shorts then this one's another
one of the cuffed tops and I love this
color I don't know what it is it's like
a purplish gray pink color something I
don't know but I loved it it's just
really pretty oh I also got this
gorgeous cobalt blue top this is like a
really nice quality top for forever 21
it looks like this it goes over in the
front and then it also ties at the
bottom if you guys know me or have
followed me for a while you know I love
to tuck in my shirts so I love it when
tops like this have a like a bottom that
gathers and ties by itself so I don't
have to tuck it into my jeans I just
thought this would be really really cute
for like 4 to July or something like
that with white pants and I just I loved
it so I don't know if this is like a new
trend for spring but I am loving these
type of tops and you'll be seeing me in
these a lot so so I've decided to call
these like summer capes because it's
kind of like the winter capes but in a
summer form cuz they're obviously not as
heavy but this is what the first one it
looks like I don't really think this is
a kimono to be quite honest with you it
doesn't look like a kimono to me but
this is it it's kind of shorter in
length and it's just gorgeous once you
put it on the sides just drape down like
that I love the little detail on the
side like the little fringes and the
front and this is just gonna be gorgeous
with some jeans and it's just easy to
pair throw a little bra let underneath
this and you'll be good to go and it's
just really nice and flowy so I loved
loved that this is another top just like
that but the sleeves are a little bit
longer so this is what it looks like
kind of like a tie guy effect and then
the sleeves go down quite a bit more so
it's a little bit more dramatic but I
thought that was really really cute and
you know so that's that looks like it
looks like somebody just took fabric
folded it and sewed it together which
they probably did I could probably do
that but I don't have time I got one
more that is my favorite and it has
tasks
on it if you guys watched my spring
videos from last year I'll just bring in
summer videos I had a lot of things with
tassels in it because I'm obsessed and I
saw this and I was like yes you're gonna
be my closet so again this is another
one of those kind of summer cape type
tops with just the tassels here on the
end and I just love this I cannot wait
to wear these you could even pair like a
tank top underneath these if you wanted
to if you didn't want sure your stomach
I got this skirt I don't necessarily
know if I'm going to keep it or not
because it's a little too girly for me
but we'll see how I can pair it it's
just this really pretty grey skirt with
pleats in it and it's just not it's it's
definitely different for me but we'll
have to see if I can maybe style it the
way I want to so it was only seventeen
eighty which is not a bad price and it
feels really nice but yeah we'll see if
I compare this and hung it away for me
to like it this is another great piece
for if it's not super cold outside but
it's not like hot either it's kind of
just chilly and this is another kind of
Cape thing
so let me when I first got this I was
like what the hell did I order and then
I finally figured it out but this is
what it looks like
basically the neckline kind of gathers
like this so it's really kind of droopy
and then it kind of goes out as a cape
as well so you just put your arms
through the holes it's just kind of hard
to show I would do a try on haul but I'm
trying to get this video up for you guys
but it's a really pretty lightweight
Cape and I like this a lot I would even
like this for going out just something
that's not too heavy but it's still
going to keep you nice and warm and then
last two things I call these like cacoon
cacoon when you call them cocoon
cardigans this is that's what I call
them out now but there are these
gorgeous like cardigans that basically
cover you like a little cocoon so cute
so not one in this cream shade let me
see if I can show you guys basically you
just put it on like this and it just
covers you and you have like all this
cute arm space I like it a lot
I thought it was adorable again another
transition piece to have trying to take
it over my head
well this fabric is really nice it's
nice and thick and super soft and then I
got that same thing in this kind of
mustard brown color which I love colors
like these this would look great even in
the summertime with like a white crop
top and some light washed denim yes and
then we're gonna move on to accessories
and the first thing I got were no-show
socks and tights which you probably
don't care about but moving on I dig at
these ear cuffs I've been really into
ear cuffs and just different earrings
lately I don't know I got these right
here from bauble bar and I just love
them so I saw these ear cuffs at forever
21 and I was like oh yes love so this is
what they look like they're nice too
gold ear cuff and basically all you do
is you of course put it in your piercing
down here and then clip it up at the top
of your ear and you have this gorgeous
like blinged out ear cuff I thought it
was adorable great to kind of spice up
any look and just add something
different so I'm really excited about
this and I'm excited that they're gold
this is like the perfect
ear cuff I've been looking for something
like this forever and then again why is
it something different that's kind of
trendy I'm kind of late on this trend
but it's the rings that have the chain
attached to the bracelet so I thought
this is adorable it has like little
rhinestones up here you probably can't
see it but I like this a lot it's really
really simple and delicate but this year
I think I'm gonna be more into jewelry
pieces and like having more things on my
hands like rings and such so I'm excited
to wear this it's super super cute and
then I got a couple necklaces that are a
little bit different for me this one's
actually a choker type of necklace and
this is just like an antique gold color
and I liked it a lot it's really
different and we'll just have to see how
it style that cuz I don't know and then
this one's really different I don't know
how I feel about it um I just have to
find something to pair it with something
that's probably a little bit more grungy
but this one again is a really high neck
necklace and it's silver which I'm
trying to branch out to more silver
items so yeah I think that's as well now
this necklace I'm excited about because
it reminds me of a BB necklace that I
tried to get forever ago I guess think
two years ago
I couldn't get it and I saw this at
first 21 and I was like oh my god that's
a very sickly the necklace so basically
it has a magnetic closure and all you do
is you just pop it up like this and put
it around your neck and it goes up to a
choker and has all of these going down
and I just think this is so freakin
adorable like oh my god
this is literally like the BB one I
wanted and I couldn't get like I
couldn't find it anywhere so I am so
excited to wear this baby it is gorgeous
okay so the last two things are shoes
these sandals right here are gorgeous
and I just know I'm gonna be able to
wear these a lot for spring and summer
and they just look like this they have
of course the nude strap and then the
black strap and I just think they're
classic but really really pretty at the
same time you can wear this with so many
different things so I love these little
sandals okay then the last pair of shoes
I bought I actually have to exchange
them because they came scuffed on the
back of the heel I don't know if you
guys can see right there they came stuff
so I'm kind of bummed about that but
these are adorable they are gorgeous
kind of camel sandal and they have a
chunky heel and I just love this for
everyone is really stepping up their
game in my opinion and these are
absolutely adorable and how much are
these does it say it doesn't say oh if
these are only 30 to 90 which i think is
a really great deal okay guys so that is
it for this haul I really hope you
enjoyed it it was a lot of stuff but all
this stuff is affordable because it is
from forever 21 so I really hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did please give
it a thumbs up and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already I'll see you all in the next
