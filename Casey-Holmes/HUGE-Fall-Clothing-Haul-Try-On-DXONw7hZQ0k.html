a fashion haul and I had to go out and
get one of these clothing racks because
I realized I had a lot of stuff to show
you guys and I didn't want to hang it up
in my closet yet so it's all hanging on
this wonderful little rack you can't
even see the whole thing let's just do a
pan right now me okay all right we're
done with the new season it comes a new
hall for me I do like a big clothing
haul every season when I do is I like to
go through my closet like right now I
have most of my stuff packed up from
last fall but I'll go through it and get
rid of things that I don't use it I
think it's a consignment or I will
donate it it just depends but I do one
big haul per season so you guys have
seen a spring haul and a summer haul
from this year so I will link those down
below if you just want to go look at
them if you love watching hauls but I
figured I would do a fall halt and I do
try everything on so you guys can see it
I actually just take a picture of it and
post it like on the side right here so
that's where you guys will be seeing in
them but yeah we've got a lot of stuff
so let's just get going with it our
stuff we're going to talk about H&amp;amp;M I
love H&amp;amp;M and honestly it'll be just say
I feel like fall is the perfect time to
kind of step outside of your comfort
zone and try different things especially
with fashion which I'll be showing you
guys here and a little bit but a chittim
is one of those great places that's more
affordable but you could still kind of
branch out and try different things so
first thing I got is a fur vest and I
think I have a fur vest from last year
but I can't remember it's probably like
store up or something but this is like a
nice little fur vest it's really cute
it's faux fur obviously I would never
wear real fur but this is just what it
looks like it's really nice quality and
I think it would look really cute with
like just a basic outfit was a little
expensive it was $40 but it's nice
quality and I think it looks really good
and then I got this top which is just
like a blushed colored top I thought it
was really pretty could go with a bunch
of different things it's just a nice
basic to have and I liked the cut of
this and the sleeves so that's that then
I got one of my favorite colors for fall
which is mustard and I love
mustard especially on brunettes like if
a brunette wears mustard I just think it
looks so gorgeous and this is like super
wrinkly so I'm sorry there's just a
basic short sleeve top and it's really
long so you can pair of leggings or
whatever and I just love this color for
fall moving on I dig it another basic
top to kind of go with some different
things this is just a nice kind of gray
button-down really nice quality it does
have like the rolled up sleeves as you
can see and this one was 24.95 but it's
not bad I like the way it sits on the
body and it is longer in the back so you
could even wear it with leggings as well
now we're getting to the good stuff okay
so then I got a pair of leather pants I
love leather pants I love pleather
leggings I love anything with fake
leather so this is what they look like
really simple leather pants and they
look a little wrinkled even once you put
them on they're not wrinkly at all they
kind of just like stretch out and smooth
out and these are the first pair of
leather pants that I've found that
actually fit my butt and my legs and
they're not like baggy so love love love
these also randomly I just got two
headbands one that's like a nude color
and I thought this would be cute just
for like puffing up your hair I don't
know obviously this is not cute but I
don't know just to kind of change things
up if I have a ponytail and I could just
kind of put in the back to kind of poof
it up a little bit and I think there's a
really cheap how much really yeah for 95
so I just got a black one and a nude one
and then I've got this jacket and I'm in
love with this army green jacket because
it's that military style jacket but it's
all one color which is amazing like it
doesn't have a crazy lining or anything
so ok makeup so this is what it looks
like again it's just that kind of like
army green kind of cargo style jacket
and I love it I love this this is going
to be a single for literally years
because it doesn't have anything crazy
going on with it it's just a simple nice
jacket so I love to this
this one was 39.95 and I got into size 4
and it just fits so well and the
thing that I got from H&amp;amp;M is this jacket
they actually didn't have it in my size
so I got in size 10 and I actually like
it because it looks more baggy so it's
kind of it kind of looks like that
boyfriend trying like a boyfriend
looking jacket even though a boyfriend
wouldn't wear this but you know what I'm
saying and it just looks really cute so
this is what it looks like just a basic
cream jacket and it goes down in the
front like that it looks really cute
baggy so if they don't have your size
don't be afraid to go up a few sizes
because it still looks really cute so
the next site I want to talk about is
revolve clothing calm and I love that
site it's kind of like one of those
sites that takes a bunch of different
brands it puts it on one side this one
is definitely more expensive it's kind
of like a when you buy it like a bit in
your wallet but I love the stuff on that
side I just I don't know I just found a
lot of stuff that I really liked and
again this isn't collective haul by the
way I didn't even say that but it is
collective so I didn't buy all this
stuff at once um but this shirt I know
some people are gonna be like if that is
so hideous but I could not keep my eyes
off it and I wanted it so bad and so
this is what it looks like it's just a
laced brown and black mixed print it is
a little bit baggy but you could tuck it
in and make it look really cute you can
undo this into like black jeans with
some black pumps and be good to go it's
like a little bit more dressy but so
casual at the same time and I really
liked it so it's just it was different
and I liked it so and then moving on I
got this cute little flannel and this is
probably the best flannel of life
because it feels so good it's so soft
and it's kind of like squishy which kind
of probably doesn't make any sense but
you know how materials can be so soft
that they're like squishy and just I
love it so this is what it looks like
okay maybe if I can get it it's just a
nice blue flannel it is a short sleeve
and it has like the cuffed
sleeves as well which I'm obsessed with
I've been obsessed with cuff sleeves
throughout this summer so I'm glad
that's going to fall but yeah this is
what it looks like really really cute
and like I said super super soft and
then I got this thermal from a three
from three
no free people and I got this one
because I was like huh try it out see if
it's worth it this is a really nice
thermal like it is heavy duty like it
just bounces I don't know if you can see
that but it's really heavy and nice it
does have a v-neck and I got it in this
kind of like oatmeal color camera just
died on me and I literally thought I
didn't film that whole thing and I
thought be like oh and then I also got
this shirt and you know why I bought it
and once you see it it says work bitch
we all know why about this because I
love me some rudy spears she is my girl
so I love it I love that song you know
you better work bitch
and I just like this cute you compare
this with like a blazer and like some
jeans and some cute boots and again a
hat and make it look really put together
like a simple top like this you can just
blame it up a little bit so I just loved
it I love this saying it's a little bit
vulgar but you know what are you gonna
do I don't know and then another thing
that I got from them is this shirt right
here I have no idea it said kiss me on
it if I did I probably wouldn't bought
it but it has like little lipsticks all
over it and in my hair that's why I
bought it because I love the fact that I
have lipsticks all over it because
obviously I love makeup so yeah I really
liked it and again you can glam this up
if you want to or keep it super casual
this shirt is definitely a different
type of shirt it's really really big but
tucking it in a little bit it's so cute
you guys know I like to tuck in my
shirts a little bit just to kind of show
that I have a waist is what the shirt
looks like it's really nice a delicate
lace piece you have this opening right
here in the front and this is a size not
small by the way and it's actually very
very very wide and then in the back you
have this deep plunging back and it also
has like a underlining in it like a nude
underlining this looks really pretty
with a Torrey secret nude bra lit
underneath because what happens is
you're still wearing a bra but the
bralette shows a little bit in the back
and it's lacy so it looks really cute
and I just thought this to be great for
the holidays with the red lip and like
your hair up I just and loved it and
then the last time I got from revolve
clothing is another one my ferrets it's
an off-the-shoulder top like this
crochet fringe sleeve and I love this
the main reason why I'm obsessed with
this top is because this is the type of
off the shoulder top that goes around
your arms and not like under your armpit
because sometimes I find when they go
under your armpit kind of like squeeze
is too hard
this one doesn't do that so it's super
flattering it just goes completely
around the arm and then this crochet
detailing right here is just super cute
great for fall moving on I'm going to
show you guys stuff I got from my Fox
boutique and again you guys know I
mentioned them I think every single haul
video that I do because I love that site
they have super cute stuff and they're
based out in Australia so the shipping
isn't that long honestly I think it
takes about a week week and a half maybe
to get my stuff but I really love their
items so first thing I want to show you
guys is this dress and this dress has
like really pretty flower on them flower
just has really pretty flowers on them
and I just love it it looks super good
on my body as most of you know I don't
have hips what are you gonna do I barely
have a waist that's just like my body
type and a lot of people rag me for it
but what the hell you want me to do get
hip implants like I'm not doing that so
this cinches in at the waist really
nicely and then kind of goes out to make
it look like you have hips and it's
really really really nice really great
fabric it's nice and thick and it sucks
you right in so I love this dress it's
gonna be really pretty for fall when I
want to go out this come on is a little
bit different I love wearing kimonos and
like especially dark kimonos like this
in the fall time because I don't know
it's just one of my favorite things to
wear especially if like it's my time of
the month and I feel bloated I throw on
a kimono and do an all black outfit and
I'm good to go because I'm in mourning
so super long and you have this fringe
detailing right here and also at the
very end and I just love it and I think
these are like flowers or something on
them like a plant but it's really really
cute again when I like in mourning or
something I'm gonna pour it and then
another thing I got is this cute cream
sweater and it's not just any cream
sweater it has of course this gold
sequins on the elbows which is super
cute also great for holiday season again
you can
you compare this with a red lip and just
some leggings or something because it is
more of a high-low so you can wear
leggings and I'll cover your butt but I
love this cute another thing I got is
this dress this is a really nice basic
LBD little black dress it also has this
mesh here in the middle which I'm trying
to see if you guys can see it right here
really really flattering it hits right
in the waist where I need it to to make
it look like I have you know a waist and
then some hips and I liked it a lot I
like the sleeves are not too long
they're too short
perfect for fall and going out and yeah
I really like it okay only two more
things from my box boutique this is a
staple for my fall outfit and it's just
a basic gray sweater dress and I love
this it looks so cute on it's not too
baggy that makes you look like you
didn't put yourself together
this looks really cute with just some
leggings and some boots and even a hat
and you could even throw a jacket over
this and I really really like it again
it's really thick that's one thing I've
noticed about whitefox boutique is that
their fabric is really nice quality
because the sight is a little bit more
expensive but you pay for what you get
um but yeah this is really nice it's
gonna keep me nice and warm this will
you be great for right win false starts
since it is more short sleeve the last
thing I got is one of my favorite
favorite favorite things this is a
jacket it's just a striped jacket you
can see I have the sleeves rolled up
this is how I'm gonna wear it it's with
the sleeves rolled up this again would
look really cute like a white top in
black jeans and some cute booties and I
just love it oh I love it has pockets
it's really long and with the sleeves
rolled up it's just gonna be adorable so
I love this huh really quickly I want to
show you guys three things that I got
from Nasty Gal
first thing is two hats now I decided
this year I would step out my comfort
zone and try some hats on I was actually
looking at Pinterest and I saw a bunch
of girls wearing these and I was like
you look so cute
so I wanted to try them out so I got
this kind of brown colored one and I
just really like it like I think it's
gonna look really cute with the right
outfit this one you can kind of just
like adjust it and I need some hair
extensions to really get some volume
here but you can just adjust it and it
looks really cute and it's kind of
like hiding from people like me I'm just
kidding but I really like this one again
this is from Nasty Gal this is the brand
Brixton and then of course I had to get
a black one and this one's a little bit
bigger which I didn't know on the site
but I actually really liked it so this
is just a black one really cute and like
old-school ish I just I don't I really
like it like Hello so this is just what
looks like again you can kind of adjust
it to make the brim however you want it
to be I love this it's so cute right I
just I love the hats this year like I
was looking at Pinterest and I just I
fell in love and I knew I needed to get
some and then the other thing that I got
from Nasty Gal is this off-the-shoulder
sweater which is again another basic you
can just pair this with leggings because
obviously I will live in leggings for
the fall winter time but I love the fact
that you can wear this off the shoulder
I think off the shoulder is so sexy for
fall especially with sweaters because
sometimes I feel like sweaters can get a
little chunky and not as cute but if
they fall off the shoulder I think it
looks really adorable so it is hi-low as
well really long so it's gonna cover
your butt and I love it it's just
similar staple to have next thing I'm
gonna show you guys is from Zara oh my
gosh so if you guys watched me last year
or like even follow me on Instagram you
know that I love the Moto kind of edgy
style so one of my favorite looks to
rock I just love feeling like a badass
basically I love anything leather moto
I love combat boots I mean anything like
that is my style for fall and wintertime
it's just what I go for I love that look
so when I saw this jacket I was like yes
okay this is for me it's really adorable
it kind of has like these padded
shoulders here at the top so it makes
you look kind of like edgy and then you
have these like flaps here in the front
which is really cool it gives it like a
really laid-back kind of edge and then
you also have the zippers and
which they are silver zippers which I
don't mind I actually like that yeah
this is just awesome if you're looking
for a badass jacket go to Zara because
this is where it's at I got one from
guests the other day too I should have
probably showed you guys that but I got
my from guests the other day that I love
but this one will probably be use the
most ok these next two things are from a
website what is their website ok so
these next things are from the site
beginning boutique I do believe I'm
pretty sure I will leave it right here
because I can't remember this is the
first chart that I got from them and I
love this it has any zipper that goes
all the way down right here and it goes
all the way up towards the neckline and
I just love the pattern like the little
checkered pattern I thought was really
adorable so yes this is a one of the
first items I got I thought it was
really adorable and then this item I'm
so excited about oh can you believe this
it's so cute black jeans and some boots
oh we're not it's so adorable but this
is what it looks like it has like a
flower and some stripe detail going on
and is a high-low so it's going to cover
your butt if you want to wear leggings
with it and then it has this like netted
detail here in the back with a really
pretty zipper and I just think this
looks so clean and chic and put together
and with the right pair of shoes you
can't go wrong
moving on to one of my favorite sites
which is forever 21 obviously I
absolutely adore forever 21 I'm always
always in there like if I go to the mall
I'm going to forever 21 so the first
thing I got was this skirt that is so
adorable and I want to wear this to like
an IMAX meetup or whatever kind of meet
if I have because I just think it's so
cute it's an a-line skirt and it has a
crochet overlay and then a slip
underneath it now this is my new
obsession you guys these pants from
forever 21 I literally bought backups
because I was like oh they're amazing so
these are the pants Oh see you can see I
got two of these right here um hey I
don't know what exactly what their names
are but I will find them and link them
down below for you guys because I love
them they're 1480 apiece this is a size
small the size small does fit me I'm a
27 inch way
and these do with fit me I know they
look like toddler pants but they do
stretch out honey and you also have this
exposed zipper right here but these are
the best pants ever they have like a
cuffed in super cute kind of gives you a
little retro style and I love these I'm
telling you these fit they like I don't
like too many skinny jeans because they
kind of sag a little bit I want my pants
to be like skin-tight but not to the
point where I'm like dying and can't
breathe and these are perfect they're
skin tight but they fit really well and
I love them so I got the gray ones I've
got black ones and I also got the dark
blue this is what the blue ones look
like they're really nice like I love
these for only $15 a piece you cannot
beat these so if you like kind of like
jeggings I guess you could say oh yeah
I'll call these checking's um definitely
check these out because they're amazing
and like this blue is to die for right
another thing I got from forever 21 is
this really cute French top and I love
this because it would just look super
cute with a pair of these jeans in black
and I love it it kind of shows a little
bit of your belly but I love this fringe
like you cannot beat it the detail is
really nice there you go you can kind of
see it there alright next up is my
favorite store ASOS and I love ASOS it's
actually gonna be the last store show
you guys um I just love ASOS like oh my
god
him no I love it but the first thing I
got was this adorable top from River
Island I've mentioned before River
Island is one of my favorite brands I
saw this top and immediately pictured
pleather leggings or leather pants like
with this would be so cute since you
have so much going on with the shark
having like a leather detail at the
bottom would just be adorable so this is
just what it looks like it's really
really cute kind of different but I love
stuff like this because it's just I'm
gonna let my style I like switching
things up I'm not biased to one thing so
that's that and then they also got
another one of these tops actually I'm a
few of these because I love the style
again it has like the cuff sleeves kinda
like that boyfriend style but this is
really cute I like the gray
the kind of salmon-colored together it
looks really really nice and these
shirts are super comfortable if you see
them on the site I definitely recommend
picking them up because I have quite a
few of them and they're just so easy to
throw on and go out the door and then
the last thing I got from ASOS is this
button-up again something you're
probably like oh girl it is so ugly but
mix of different patterns on it kind of
has also an ombre effect going on but
you have like this really pretty stuffed
flower detail and I just loved it like I
don't know something about it just spoke
to me and said you need that in your
life and I was like okay fine I'll get
it okay guys so that is it for my fall
