meet you all so I can't wait but yeah
just make sure you RSVP and let us know
that you're coming but some of the
clothes might have Daisy's hair on them
obviously because you just keep spitting
on them but I'll start off with the
website called necessary clothing and I
really love that site because they have
super cute stuff so the first thing is
this sweater or yeah sweater and I love
anything pleather if you follow my blog
which if you don't you should I've been
hey quitting your foot if you don't
follow me on my blog I have been really
active on it lately and I actually just
did a new post yesterday and I really
liked the way it turned out so I'll
leave that down below you can follow it
you can also follow it by email a lot of
these items will be put on my blog like
an outfit of the days and stuff like
that but this is a first sweater it just
looks like this and it just has like the
pleather detail on the sleeves and then
on the back it does have a pleather
detail on the bottom it's just really
cute has that high-low hem so it does
cover a little bit more of your tush
which is great and then I also got this
other shirt which like a tribal printed
shirt and the front is a little bit
shorter than the back so it's kind of
got that
i lo feel and it just looks really
really cute on i'd like this a lot I
also got this from them it's a pair of
leggings I love leggings especially if
they have pleather I just I buy them all
the time so these leggings are in a size
small if you're wondering and you see it
has pleather all the way down the sides
so when you do wear the leggings they
look like this like you have just the
pleather on the sides and it looks
really really cute so I love these they
fit really well this is definitely one
of my favorite tops that I got it just
looks like this it has the pleather at
the top and these sleeves are more of
that cotton feel and then the bottom is
a wine color so it's just a really cute
kind of mixed texture top and then it
also does open up here on the sides
pretty high so it looks really cute with
like leggings or high waisted pants so I
like this it'll be cute for layering so
that is all I got from necessary
clothing now moving on to Marshalls I
did get three things the first pair of
leggings are actually on my blog on my
most recent post they just have the
pleather on the sides I get a triangle
shape on the thigh and also on the calf
I really love those there's not only
about I think seventeen dollars and then
I just got a pair of regular dark denim
because I feel like you can never go
wrong with dark denim and these just
feel so good they kind of feel like
jeggings and these are from the brand
indigo rain and these were $17 as well
and then I got another pair of leggings
with some pleather on them I believe
that this pair was $20 but this one is
just really simple it just has the
pleather up in me it's just a little bit
different which I like so that's just
what it looks like if I'm moving on to
firm 21 the first thing I want to show
you guys is this jacket now I'm not a
big fan of like full-on denim jackets so
I don't have one in my closet but I saw
this one and I had to have it so it just
looks like this it has the denim jacket
vest type thing and it has a hoodie
material for the hood and for the
sleeves so I love this because it just
kind of has like this distressed parts
on the top and the whole vest is kind of
distressed really so great on it's
really comfortable
and this was 30 to 80 and I got it in an
extra small so I like it it's super
super cute and I think of thee something
just easy and casual just to throw on
also from forever 21 I did get this
basic sweater this is a size small it
was 20 to 80 and I love this because
it's actually a pretty heavy material so
it's gonna keep you nice and warm and it
is a 3/4 sleeve so it's really cute and
I'll go with a lot of things and I had
this pictured with the boots that I
bought and like black leggings I think
it's gonna make a cute outfit and you'll
see the boots here in a minute but I was
excited about this it's actually pretty
affordable for such a you know thick
sweater because this is definitely gonna
keep you warm and then I also got this
sweater that I actually got in a medium
so I got a little bit bigger and this
was 20 to 80 and this is just the print
on it I really liked it they actually
had the sleeves rolled up a little bit
and I love the way that it looked so I
just picked it up I feel like you can
never have too many sweaters in the fall
and winter time the last shirt I got
from forever 21 is this army green top
and it just has like a faux pocket with
some pleather and studs and then it has
like the cuff sleeves which I'm a really
big fan of this is a size small and it
was 1580
so I really like that this seems like it
has pretty good weight to it as well and
then the last thing I got where a pair
of boots that I plan on carrying with
that white sweater I showed you and then
also some leggings and I don't have any
boots like this so these are just like
little brown combat boots I love them I
thought they were super cute and just
plain and they're a little bit
distressed I don't know if you can tell
but these were 3980 and in love that a
zip on the sides which makes it so
convenient last place I went to I was
there for literally like two hours and
no joke and it was hmm I've never taken
the time to actually sit and walk around
hmm until I went this time and I was
like wow I'm finding a lot of stuff I
think H&amp;amp;M just like crayons all their
stuff kind of like forever 21 it's just
not as big they still cram a lot of
their stuff together so
I'll show you what I got the first thing
I'll show you is the jeans and I got
four pairs of jeans three of them are
really affordable and then the one pair
about to show you they were a little bit
more pricey so this is the first parent
they're just regular dark denim they're
the skinny low waist in number and 26
waist and these were $40 but they're
really nice material this is what they
look like and they're a little bit faded
in the front which I really like and a
little bit of distressed part here in
the back I like them they feel really
nice on they're super soft so these next
three were $20 a piece these are these
super skinny low waist and these are
just black jeans I found that this ran
kind of small I had to go a size up so I
got these in a 27 but they're just
regular black skinnies nothing too crazy
and then I got two pairs of like kind of
active washed jeans these are the
divided super slim leg jeans and a size
six and again these were $20 I thought
this would be super cute with an
oversized sweater
like in black and some combat boots so I
really liked it they're kind of like a
darker they're kind of like a light dark
grey they're really cute and then I just
got a pair of regular acid washed tight
jeans from the same kind of brand the
divided super slim leg and they're just
regular acid washed I feel like you can
never go wrong I asked to wash jeans I
just look super cute unless they're way
too overdone and again size six and
these are 28 bucks okay I'm moving on to
the sweaters from H&amp;amp;M the first one this
is like a very lightweight sweater but
it's really cute so it kind of has like
this sheer panel at the top this is the
back as like a sheer panel at the top
and it looks like this like I said it's
really fine but it looks really cute and
it could be great for layering this was
a size small and it was 24.95 I also got
my first crop sweater now I'm not
usually a crop sweater kind of person
especially if they're like super cropped
but this one actually really cute on you
can't tell on camera I don't think but
it's a light peach color and it's not
too shorts just a little bit shorter in
the front then it
in the back and it shows like maybe a
couple centimeters of your stomach if
that and I really liked it so it's a
size small and it was 1295 and then the
next shirt I got is just a really great
kind of basic to throw him with anything
layer with anything I just loved it this
cute little grey shirt and the sleeves
are cuffed on it which I love and it's
very long so you can wear it with
leggings and you'll still cover your
butt so this was 1795 and I got in size
small and it's so soft you guys I feel
like H&amp;amp;M has really soft fabric and I
just I love it and then I did just get a
basic white long sleeves because you
know need it for layering this one was
1295 so it's next where I actually got
in a size medium mainly because they
didn't have size small but it was on
sale for 995 from $25 so I wanted to
pick it up and I actually had black
jeans on the day that I went shopping
and I took this into my jeans and it
looked really cute on so this is what it
looks like again it's kind of like that
light peach color let me move these tags
all the way and it kind of has some like
fringe in the front I guess you could
say it's really cute just like a subtle
detail and that's just how it looks like
it's really cute I like it a lot we have
to word things we have this shirt that I
just fell in love with that is actually
last minute like right before I checked
out I saw it and I was I just had to
have it
and this was twenty four ninety five and
I got it in a size eight mainly because
I'm a more bigger chested on the front
and I hate it when like you wear button
ups and it kind of spaces not like this
and you can see skin it's just kind of
annoying to me
so I got in size eight and it's really
cute it has like cuff sleeves and it's
the softest material ever like it's so
comfy and it's gonna be so cute to layer
with like different jackets and stuff
you know I just I don't know I love it
it's a cute little basic top that'll go
with so many different things so this
wire is one I actually didn't know if I
would like or not mainly because I don't
know I just thought it was too busy for
me but every time I walked in there I
would go past it and look at
and wonder if I would like it and
finally I just you know tried it on this
time since I was trying on a bunch of
different items and I loved it so it's
just this sweater with like a Jaguar
print I guess you could say and it's
really cute it has the cuff sleeves as
well and this one size small Islam and
it was 29.95 and it's pretty it's a
pretty nice knit too so that is all I
got for my fall fashion haul I hope you
