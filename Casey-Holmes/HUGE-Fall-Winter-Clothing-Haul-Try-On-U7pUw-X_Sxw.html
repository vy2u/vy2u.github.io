a clothing haul probably gonna be my
last clothing haul for a while because
I've actually been accumulating this
stuff for I'd say a month now and I'm
actually in the process of looking for a
new house so this will probably be the
last clothing haul that I do for a while
because obviously I'm gonna want to
focus on a house and buying things for
it so I'm really excited but I'm also
excited to show you guys that this stuff
because it is more recent things should
be able to find a majority of these
pieces I'm pretty sure they will still
be on the sites I'm gonna show you guys
all the clothing stuff and then I also
have a few pairs of shoes I know I don't
need anymore
I never go to Target but when I went I
saw these shoes and I was like where
have I been
why have I not been here okay so the
first place I want to talk about is one
that I talk about every clothing haul
it's because I love them and I cannot
stay off their sight it's whitefox
boutique you guys probably talked about
them a lot if you've seen some of my
clothing hauls so this is the first
piece that I got it's just a really nice
long tunic it could be worn as a dress
like with leggings or you can just wear
this as a shirt which is what I will be
doing because you guys know I don't wear
dresses hardly ever but I have like a
little bit of leopard here on the sleeve
which is really cute I don't like too
much leopard going on
but although accents like this I think
can work really nicely but is thicker
and it has this like black stripe here
it's just a really cute kind of casual
top so I absolutely adored that and then
I also got this jacket from them it has
like a fur lining and it is so soft of
course it is faux fur never real
I would never purchase real fur ever it
just feels really good it's really comfy
and then you have the little strings
right here that you can just pull and
cinch it in so you can see that you know
you do have a waist and it's a nice kind
of heavy duty jacket so it's gonna be
great for the winter because as most of
you know it's beginning super cold
recently like there's been a huge cold
front come through and it's freezing so
I need thick jackets like that to save
me this winter so this is another thing
that I got and I'm obsessed with this it
has a bad word but honestly you guys I
love the
I've always learned a shirt that said
this on it and it says Cunha Matata
bitches I just love this shirt is so
freaking cute it's really really soft
you guys like super soft it's not
necessarily like sweatshirt material
like it's not really thick so it's
perfect for layering you could pair this
with like a moto jacket cute scarf I
love it up boys love the hakuna matada
stuff going around I've been looking at
it like on Pinterest and things like
that and I just loved it so I got - I
small and it fits really well and like I
said it's super super soft I absolutely
adore it and then the last thing I got
is really simple from white fox it's
just this long-sleeve kind of crossed
over shirt and it's really pretty it
kind of goes a little bit tighter at the
arms so it really shows off like your
arms and you know it doesn't look too
baggy but I love this it sits on the
chest really nicely and I love the
little detail here in the front it just
makes it a little bit different and
again you could layer with this or just
wear it by itself it's super cute so I
was walking through Target and I saw
these shoes and I was like shut up I was
gonna get a black pair of these Steve
Madden ones but Target literally has a
dupe for them this is from the brand
Massimo would you guys just look at this
this looks exactly like this shoe but in
black like it literally looks exactly
like the black Steve Madden ones I was
blown away these were I think about $35
which is a steal I think these are about
90 something I'm not too positive about
these a while back so if you're wanting
like a dupe for the Steve Madden boots
that look like this but in black you
need to go to Target because they're
exactly the same
I was I was blown away I could not
believe it okay so the next pair shoes I
actually got two colors and just because
I loved them so much and this is these
are from the Sam and Lindy's line at
Target which I really like that line is
actually really really cute but this is
but this is just what they look like
really cute I love the bottoms of these
they look a little bit more edgy and I
love the thick chunky heel and the fact
that they're not too high they just sit
like right at the ankle so love these
ankle booties but the main reason why I
bought them is for the bottoms because
they have a nice
to them and yeah it just gives like a
really edgy look so I loved these so I
just got those in black and these were I
believe in from around $40 as well and
then I also adopted in the brown because
I have nothing like this and this color
so I definitely wanted this in my life
and I just loved it it's really really
cute and different now these last pair
that I got from Target is again Massimo
and these are just so cute like I saw
them and I was like I cannot pass these
boots up so this is just what they look
like they have like a fur lining on the
inside
I do believe these are on sale when I
got them can't really remember they
didn't have my size I'm a size eight but
I tried on a seven and a half and they
actually fit pretty perfectly so you can
either wear the boots up like this or
they have snaps right here where you can
just snap it down and see all the fur
and stuff and it's a really really
comfortable boot super cute and again I
don't have anything like this or this
color and I loved it I loved the kind of
rustic worn look with the fur it's just
so cute so definitely check out Target
if you're looking for like new shoes
because they have really great deals on
shoes okay the next thing I want to show
you guys is from ASOS only got two
things from ASOS the first thing is this
top right here I don't necessarily know
to call this pattern but I really loved
it the color combo I thought was super
cute for layering you do have this open
back detail which I love and it's just a
really easy top to put together and
throw with different pieces that you
have in your closet and then I got this
adorable chiffon shirt I'm a sucker for
chiffon shirts I wear them pretty much
non-stop I just think they're so easy
but this is from the brand warehouse and
this was also from the brand Villa
clothes if you're wondering but this is
really pretty it has a zipper detail
right here it's kind of like a topi
purple shade very very pretty and I love
the detail of this and the arms and it
just looks really gorgeous on so loved
this a lot okay so the next place I want
to show you guys is when
and I love Windsor so much they just
have really cute stuff especially during
this time of year so the first thing
that I purchased was this blue top it
has like a scalloped into it with a
little layering going on but the main
thing about this is the back it has a
really pretty open back again with that
scalloped detail and it's just so pretty
this would like a lace bra let would be
beautiful with some high-waisted jeans
or leggings whatever you wanted to pair
with it $30 it was twenty nine ninety so
I liked it I love the color I thought it
was a pretty good deal and then I also
got another flannel from Windsor because
I liked the color combo of this it's
just the red white and blue with a
little bit of a darker Navy in there and
this is super super soft love this so
much I love flannels is heavier they're
just easy to throw on trunk a scarf on a
jacket and you're good to go so this one
was twenty four ninety which isn't a bad
price especially for how soft this is
it's really really great quality another
thing from a Windsor is this adorable
little lace sleeve kind of sweatshirt
thing it's not really a sweatshirt but
it's very thin so you would have to kind
of layer this with other pieces you
would be freezing if you just had this
and you're in like a really cold climate
so this is what it looks like it has the
crochet detailing here on the arms it
just adds a little bit something to this
outfit and it is a boatneck type of top
which I love I think they're super
flattering another thing that I'm in
love with I saw this I believe on
windsors Instagram and I went straight
to their site and purchased it because I
love this vest it looks like this is a
black and fur vest but I love the detail
right here kind of like that
asymmetrical look to it it's so cute
nice and edgy the fur is not too
overpowering it's just a nice subtle for
a vest you know what I mean so I love
this I love the gray I don't have a gray
and black vest like this okay the next
thing I got is so cute I've worn this my
best friend's worn this we love this
shirt so this shirt has a chiffon and a
crochet mix so you have like a crochet
detail here around the chest and up here
on the neck it is a high neck so it
comes up to about right here super
pretty and the
rest of the shirt is just your fawn and
it looks really nice you compare it with
a strapless bra or like a lace bra light
which is what I usually paired stuff
like this with and it just looks so
classic and I feel like this part right
here the crochet details just make it
look a lot more expensive and I just I
love it so definitely pick this one up
if you guys are interested okay the next
thing I got is again something that I
don't have but I really loved this I
thought it was so cute
pairing it with like a cream top and
some jeans and some boots and you're
good it's a I guess you call it a
cardigan I don't know I don't really
wear cardigans often but I liked this
one a lot because it was different you
kind of have like this suede issue
material right here and then a knit
detail and then a little bit of faux fur
and it's just different I love the
different textures and everything like
that and it makes it really nice and
different so easy to put on a casual
outfit like I said a white top and jeans
and then put something like this on with
some boots it just kind of spices it up
so I loved this really pretty and it is
a little bit thicker so it's perfect
like if you're going out for dinner and
lunch or something like that and just
need something that's not too heavy
now this jacket you guys makes me feel
like a badass and it is a peplum jacket
and this is a love this jacket this one
was a 3490 I got it in a size medium and
it does fit pretty snug on me especially
around my chest area cuz I do have a
larger chest but this is a peplum jacket
let me just zip this up for you hold on
I love the shoulders of this because
they're kind of a little bit poofy so
they really give you a nice shape up
here to go along with these peplum
bottom and you can see it just kind of
stops here and then you have this peplum
and it's really really really flattering
if you don't have much of a waist going
on then it will help kind of create that
waist for you and then flare out I love
this jacket so much it's not a thick
jacket it's more of like if you're going
out for drinks with your girlfriends you
want to chuck this on and you'll look
gorgeous another thing that I got from
Windsor is this top right here I love
this top because I love the details
right here where you have like all of
this kind of open up and then the
sleeves
these are kind of like a high-low and
they're really loose so when you like Oh
put your arm up it kind of falls down in
a really pretty way so I love this it's
really lightweight and it's something
easy just to throw on so love this so
pretty and then this shirt is like I can
just see myself wearing this combat
boots a leather jacket and just being
like BAM with a scarf oh so pretty this
is a oh I have a necklace too I'll show
you that in a minute so this is a ripped
up long-sleeve shirt and it's a high-low
and it also comes up here on the sides
really pretty with high-waisted jeans
and it's just really edgy and that's
what I love about it it is a lightweight
shirt so definitely gonna have to layer
this up but it is stunning I just love
this it was so cute that I was on BCBG
not too long ago their website they were
having this huge sale I think it was
like twenty or thirty percent off I
don't know but it was some percent off
that I was like oh my gosh I need to
stock up on my favorite items right now
so I picked up a few things from them I
love BCBG I know they were really
expensive but from personal experience
these shirts and the pants that I have
purchased from them have lasted so well
and they just look amazing the quality
is just perfect so the first thing I got
I'm so excited to wear this is a leather
front shirt so this is what looks like
in the front it's really sexy it's not
too tight very flattering and then the
back has like this netted detail which I
love super sexy I love like showing off
the back I'm especially with like a
bralette of course I prepare bra lines
with everything I love this top I first
I was kind of nervous because I thought
would be too tight but it's not it all
is so stunning and then I dig it two
pairs of leggings from them I have no
leggings like this so this one has a
really different kind of front to it I
don't know what you call this I don't
know but the front is like super
different has a different texture to it
you have pockets and it goes all the way
down the back is just a nice kind of
legging material loved that and
I also got this pair of leggings which
are just leather details on the side
these never go out of style I wear
leggings every year and if they have
leather detail
I wear them even more now this item I
had been eyeing for a while I went to
the store a couple months ago and they
had this there I tried it on and I was
like no I don't need it and then I
really loved it I just didn't end up
purchasing it and then I saw it online
and I was like just buy the thing like
you know when people say if you can't
stop thinking about it
buy it that's what I did so it's like
nothing special but when you put it on
and pair it with like different tops
like a long sleeve top it looks so cute
so it's just like this sweater t-shirt
kind of thing I love this a lot it has a
high-low detail bigger sleeves it's just
another really great layering piece and
it's super soft and I just love the way
that it looks you compare this with like
a pattern long-sleeved top make it a
little bit more girly or you could put a
long black sleeve top underneath it and
a chunky statement piece it would be
beautiful this is nothing I picked up at
the sale it has like this frill thingy
here I don't know what you would call
this I don't know but it's a cute top it
has the sharkbite bottom here as you can
tell and I just loved this top I thought
was super girly and feminine great for a
night out and of course you guys know me
I love to tuck in my shirt so I would
plan on tucking it in and having all
this peek out and I could just see
myself wearing this with my skinny jeans
and a statement necklace and somewhat
cute boots and a leather jacket but when
I get cold and it's just gonna be
gorgeous
also it got this tough I actually got
this top in a blue grey kind of color
and I post it on my Instagram so I'll
show you guys a picture right now but I
ruined that shirt because I'm an idiot
and I washed it and I had to get it
dry-cleaned
so I ruined it I was really upset about
it because I loved that color but I went
ahead and got it in this light pinky
peach color and it's really cute it has
this mesh detail in the front so it's
really sexy
it's a high-low and it's just a really
nice loose top to either go pretty
casual with it or glam it up and I love
it
I think it's so cute and pretty and I
just I'm so sad everyone the blue-gray
one it was my favorite one and then this
the last thing I got from BCBG that was
on sale and this is really freaking cute
so this is what the top looks like and
you have this kind of cutout detail
right here and it goes all the way down
and then the back has like this little
detail where it just opens up which is
super sexy I also forgot to show you
guys this hat that I got from white box
boutique you guys know if you watched my
last to fall haul
I had another black hat like this but
the rim is pretty large on it and I
wanted something that was a little bit
smaller so I got this one the brim on
this is perfect it's not too big and it
lays really nicely on the head so I got
this one because I thought it was cute
and I mean it's something that would be
good for like a casual outfit or
something so again this one was for
white box boutique I totally forgot all
about that ok the last place I'm going
to show you guys is shop hopes I love
Shaw popes I kick in enough of them and
I just love their clothing this is the
first thing that I got from them it's
this really cute blue top with a crochet
detail here on the bottom really pretty
really feminine something that's super
easy to style and I just love the detail
of the different shades of blue in this
and it was just on them really cute and
I figured I would kind of step out of my
edgy comfort zone and try some things
that are a little bit more girly you
guys know I love looking like a badass
and all black but sometimes you got to
be a girl so if they're gonna hope it
kiff that and then this outfit was
actually paired together on the site and
I loved the color combo and then just
love the way that it looked so this is a
shirt it's kind of like a how would you
say it like a burnt blush color if that
makes any sense at all but this is what
it looks like really really cute a nice
button up the material is nice and thick
and I love it and then it was paired
with this little vest and it has a faux
leather detail with a faux fur lining
and this is the dark chocolate brown
really gorgeous so put these together
and this is what you give well obviously
it looks a little bit better paired like
buttoned up and everything but it's cut
it's really cute
just kind of taking two different styles
I feel like I'm putting them together
and they just work and the color combo
is pretty much fantastic so I bought
both of those on the site and then the
next thing I got actually have this type
of shirt in another color but it's more
of a submarine kind of top so I figured
I would pick it up in this gorgeous like
a darker floral it has a cross over here
in the front and it cinches in at the
waist and then the back has this really
pretty black crochet detail all the way
down just a little hint of sexy again
with the back I love things that show
the back so yeah this is definitely more
fall appropriate and a nice kind of like
night out shirt last thing I want to
show you guys is this little scarf that
I got from shop folks and I just want
you guys if you can think of why I
bought this I want you to comment down
below just just comment down below right
now before I tell you I bought it
because it's the perfect football game
day scarf I saw this and I was like shut
up
perfect so as you guys know I'm a huge
football fan if you don't know I'm a
huge college football fan I am an Auburn
fan so we're giggle to all my fellow
Tiger lovers out there and I just was
like oh this is perfect
I'm going to a game in Athens this year
and of course it's gonna be colder
because it's going to be in a couple
weeks and obviously the weather is
getting really insane and freezing so I
saw this it's a really thick scarf of
course it's the colors and I just love
this scarf I think it is so pretty I
cannot wait to wear it it's gonna keep
me super warm so I got this off of there
and I just oh you guys have no idea I
fell in love when I saw this scarf on
the site and I was like they get me get
me oh and another thing that I got I
keep forgetting I have like shoes here
on the bottom because they're just
sitting on the clothing rack so I keep
forgetting these items I got these shoes
from Windsor as well oh listen myself
enough face so I also got these shoes
from Windsor and they're kind of like
Timberland knockoffs if you guys have
seen on my Instagram when I went to Ikea
a month two months ago I can't remember
I had a pair of shoes like this but they
had a heel I'll post a picture of it
right here for you guys if you want to
check it out
but I wanted to pair that was more flat
so I got these
I love these style boots right now I
think they're really cute edgy fun and I
just think they're badass like I don't
know there's just something about these
that I can't resist so when I got these
items from whitefox boutique I thought
oh you know Georgia you know it goes
back and forth with being hot being cold
I could totally wear these shoes in the
fall time you know just the transition
shoe I'm not gonna be able to wear them
but I love them
I mean maybe one day I'll have to find
like the perfect outfit for fall if I
camera these but I just love them
they're like a block and I just I was so
obsessed with them I loved the strap
detail right here but this is what they
look like they're very chunky heel
they're gonna be super comfortable to
walk in you won't even know you're
wearing a heel and they give you a lot
of height which I love and this is from
the brand lipstick and again it is on
the white box boutique site so if it's
warmer where you live I think these
would be super cute for fall or even if
you had like spring weather right now
you would love these I just love the
strap detail like I think that is so
sexy I don't know it's really simple but
very very cute though that is all the
items I've accumulated at this past
month I just wanted to show you guys
because I know a lot of you do love
fashion hauls I definitely try to do a
lot of outfit post online Instagram I've
just really gotten into fashion and
stuff this last year year and a half and
it's just one of my favorite things and
I love trying different styles and
things like that so I figured I would
show you guys these pieces because they
are pretty different but super cute at
the same time thank you guys so much for
watching
if you didn't like the video please give
it a thumbs up and I will see you guys
in just a couple of days bye
I gotta keep myself in check sometimes
cuz I tend to dream I have will bake
some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
