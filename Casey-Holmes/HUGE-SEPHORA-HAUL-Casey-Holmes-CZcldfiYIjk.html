wait for it I got a big bag I have not
had a big bag like this and forever
props before and she able to mean I was
like can I keep it yeah can I keep it I
went to Sephora the other day because I
have if you guys haven't bought me for
you know like the past month I've been
sick and I was just having a really bad
day because I like how to Sean and I was
just like having a bad day about the
sickness and I wanted to go shopping to
make myself feel better so that's
exactly what I did actually asked you
guys on Twitter I was like should I
should I not and all them were uh yeah
you should and you better filmer haul so
you know I got you men's tissue paper
ever okay so first thing I actually have
on my desk right here because I used it
today actually I have a sample of this
and I wanted it in full-size because I
loved it
I also have the net cream by Tarte it's
amazing but this is a tarte maracuja see
brightener eye treatment and i love this
it makes my under eye area feel so good
I also love the Bobbi Brown under-eye
cream as well but I believe this one's
cheaper I mean I could be wrong but it
might be a little bit cheaper and I just
really like it a lot so I love the look
of this has like the little bamboo of
top and yeah you get that much product
which is quite a bit it is filled up to
the top but I love this you only need a
little bit just dab it in and it makes
your under eyes feel so soft I got this
clinic bag I'm not too sure why I didn't
buy anything Clemmy but she gave me this
bag so I was like okay and then another
thing I got this for a 500-point perk
because I've been traveling quite a bit
and I love caviar caviar is one of my
favorite brands for my hair this is the
caviar anti-aging replenishing moisture
shampoo conditioner also comes with the
lengthening hair and scalp elixir and
the leave-in hair Perfector I don't mind
getting stuff like this just to stock up
until I go on vacation or something and
just toss these in the bag so love this
brand definitely recommend you guys
checking them out
the replenishing moisture shampoo
conditioner is like a God said it's
amazing another thing which just is kind
of boring but I bought a lot of them I
bought five actually just used one last
night I bought five of the Vita Liberata
self-tanning mist favorite favorite
favorite favorite mix to apply
self-tanner I use loving tan self-tanner
so what I have one right now I do have
like a little coat for you guys if you
want to get a free gift with your
purchase it's the self tanner I've been
using Wow for a really long time like
the beginning of next year will be
almost a year and I just love it
bailamos this mitt whether it's just so
good and they always stock up when I go
in store because if I don't have this
mitt I'm I will not apply self-tanner I
won't because this just supplies it so
smoothly and it just looks so good
I also got these to try out because chic
mouth could really had my interest
lately and these are the bozo charcoal
pore minimizing hydrogel masks and it
says it minimizes pores purifies and
refines texture so I just wanted to try
these out I bought two so I was thinking
to myself if I buy it and I love it I
want to do it again and I wouldn't be
able to go to the support because I'm
too lazy to wait till it to come in
sometimes like this time I was too
impatient wait for an online order to
come in so I was like I'll just buy two
and if I don't like it I'll get to them
all so I'm excited to try this out this
is exciting I've been wanting this and
it seemed so many people haul this and
I'm like oh what it in my life I wanted
the Tarte eyelash curler in the holiday
woman I couldn't find it so I was really
excited to get this though it's the
tarte high-performance Naturals holidays
so this is a 5 limited edition gold
brushes you get the best-selling buffer
airbrush finish foundation brush which I
love to actually apply self-tanner on my
hands and stuff you get the concealer
brush eyeshadow brush complexion brush
and a fluffy blush brush but this
packaging for tart is so stinkin cute
but this is even better like I'm
obsessed with it so this is what that
looks like it's a really nice case like
it's sturdy and it feels really good and
it's obviously like rip very cute so you
open it up you have this gorgeous inside
I'm sure you guys seen a million times
just like rose gold and I was really
into these brushes like I saw the
collection and I was like yes I love
these I cannot wait to try them so yeah
I love this for self-tanner
I want to try for foundation so it's
good that I have two separate ones now I
can't wait to try this one cuz I love to
a fiber brushes this looks really pretty
I love it and I'll probably use like
this one for concealer and then this one
for who knows what you can use brushes
for whatever you want to use them for
okay next big thing is really exciting
it's the Kat Von D maybe the loca
palette oh so excited about this it is
beautiful I love the concept of this
palette
hold on so this is what the front looks
like it does have like a little sheet on
the back with some makeup looks this is
so beautiful I love the artwork on all
of her stuff I think it's just
absolutely stunning and she really takes
the time for it and then these are the
colors inside so you just slide it out
which I love and then you have all the
neutrals here in the center and then all
of ours on the outside so love this I
cannot wait to play with it Kat Von D
shadows have amazing pigmentation so
yeah this is awesome awesome also I
cannot wait to play the next thing I got
is I haven't really heard anybody talk
about this I mean I've seen people haul
it but I haven't seen anybody like
review it but it's the glam glow count
Ludwig lip balm treatment and the fuzzy
lip exfoliating lip treatment so I want
to try this out since winter is coming
or like just colder weather in general
is coming and see how this works too for
my lips because my lips get a little dry
and they look kind of rough sometime so
yeah I like the packaging of this - it's
so unique and cool oh my god I'm so
excited about this I've already busted
it up it and then spraying on myself I
think I solved your world right now cuz
I didn't spread this today by sprayed
yesterday and I'm obsessed
it is roses to Chloe and if you like the
scent of roses yeah you will love this
so much the only thing is this
little-ass bottle cost me $70 I guess in
that ridiculous that's all I'm saying
but this smells so good I love the way
it smells oh it's just fresh clean roses
like oh my god I love it
I love it so so so much I'm so
yeah I wanted to just splurge on a new
perfume because I've been using the same
ones for a while now and this one I
think is great year-round but if you
don't like roses you a Belinda so next I
did buy another locket on hand cream I
bought this for my purse because the
airport threw away my big one that I
purchased at the airport so had to buy
another one I also got two of these NARS
audacious lipsticks um I have not seen
these colors I don't think are they new
did they come up with new colors I don't
know but the packaging of this feels
good
like this is different so the colors I
got are Deborah and Leslie I'm so
obsessed with these colors like I cannot
wait to wear them so this one is in the
shade Deborah mhm
oh my god this is just a gorgeous brown
like a hint of burgundy in it it is so
beautiful and then this one is Leslie
another gorgeous one oh my god I love
these audacious lipsticks so much better
than their other lipstick formula it's
like so much better so that one's Leslie
it's kind of like a I don't know how you
describe it like a dark rosy brown with
even like a hint of orange in there it's
different but I like it I also got
another Beauty Blender it's just
something I always do when I go in there
I always just stock up on one more
Beauty Blender and then another lip
product is this C opt a liquid velvet
lipstick the matte lipstick and it's in
the color saloon but another packaging
is just really simple and this is just a
great everyday darker nude shade so
that's it right there just sounds like a
pink undertone to it's really really
pretty I like it's coming off a little
bit more pink on camera but it's
definitely a nice nude color I also got
the Kat Von D locket concealer I got the
shade medium 22 and I just wanted to try
this for underneath my eyes I know it's
like super full coverage and everything
but I just wanted to kind of play with
something new because I've been using
Mac Pro Longwear for ages now and yeah
I've never tried this out someone to
test it out and see then I got this this
is the
girl on lingerie - PO new powder
foundation I didn't realize this was a
powder foundation when I bought it so I
got home and I was testing things out on
my hand but I'll just use this as a
power to set to my face this is in the
shade o for medium beige and the powder
is so silky smooth and when I put on my
hand it made my hair look poreless and I
was like stop doesn't this pasty little
Spacey thing which I probably won't keep
but then the packaging is gorgeous as
well it's just nice and sleek and then
you open it up and you have a nice large
mirror and then you have the sponge that
I just like to keep sponges like this in
here just in case you need it for
something but this is a color it's
really got its so finely milled and so
smooth I just can't I can't stop with it
I just love it go put your fingers in it
at Sephora because you'll be like oh my
gosh
okay the next few things are what I get
Oh two highlighters and lip products so
I got this Stila eternally yours lips
liquid lipstick step because I loved all
of the colors and I was like yes I need
that in my life and this would be an
amazing amazing gift I think these are
just the perfect sizes for the good
lipsticks and it's so many different
shades so you get one two three four
five six shades yes those are amazing I
think that set is totally worth it you
have a color for literally everything
everything it's beautiful
I got two highlighters I've never seen
this highlighter I don't know if I'm
crazy but I've never seen it
it's the Josie Maran Argan and light
metal luminizing veil and it's a creamy
highlighting powder it looks just like
the highlighting like the liquid
highlighter she has but let's be real
momma doesn't use out all the time I
just don't time for liquid highlighter
sometimes like I don't
mix them in with my foundation or
anything I just apply them to my face
and it just takes a little extra time
that I don't want to do so this is
perfect is absolutely gorgeous and it
looks just as setting as the liquid one
I'm not oh my god it's so pretty so
excited to wear this but it just gives
that nice glow you can't even really
tell on camera how amazing it is but it
is absolutely beautiful this is the most
exciting highlighter because I was going
in there and I was trying to find this
and I went to Bobbi Brown I couldn't
find it but I found it in the most
random section of Sephora
with like I guess like hits like the
product hits or whatever like ones that
are doing really well so cute it's the
Bobbi Brown highlighting powder and on
here it says strobing it's about
highlighting the positive which I love
that just looks like this it kind of
looks like her shimmer breaks but a lot
smaller but what I love about this one
is that it opens up all the way with a
mirror because her shimmer breaks only
open up about that much which kind of
bothers me sometimes but just look at
that it is so beautiful it's exactly
what it's called a bronze glow shade and
I just love this color love it it's
right there oh my gosh it's so beautiful
I unfortunately have not been able to
get my hands on the new Mack
highlighters I went into a Mac yesterday
and I was like please tell me you have
it and they did have it they had just
sold out the day before they were like
they hadn't they were stopped and then
they're out so I was like super
depressed because I really want those
