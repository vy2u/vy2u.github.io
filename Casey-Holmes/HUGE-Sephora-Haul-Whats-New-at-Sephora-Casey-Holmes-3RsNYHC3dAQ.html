for you I just got back from vacation
last night actually and I have been gone
for two weeks I haven't been able to sit
down and film in two weeks and it is so
crazy and weird to be filming right now
but I am so excited because I figured
the first video I would come back with
is a Sephora haul I have things that
I've purchased and also some things that
I got from PR so I'll do the things I
bought first and then the PR stuff last
I also want to quickly announce the
speaking of Sephora I will be at the
Sephora and m.i.c in Union Square this
Friday I'll leave all the info down
below in the description box if you're
interested but I am so excited to meet
you guys
I haven't done a meet-up in so long and
I Love New York so I'm really excited to
go back and to meet some of you like I
said I'll have everything listed down
below but it is in NYC this Friday at
the Union Square so for some of this
stuff that I have that I purchased I
have tried so I'm going to share that
with you guys and then I'm gonna mention
some of this PR stuff some of the stuff
I like some of the stuff I don't like
but i'ma let you know first thing I'm
gonna mention is the Canon Austin a
private protected mattifying primer has
SPF 50 it's green tea vitamin C and a
bunch of other little things in here I
don't know but I do know the green tea
and vitamin C but I have never heard of
this brand before and I had read the
reviews and they were really good so I
wanted to give it a shot and it is a
mattifying primer so oily skin I had to
try it out that's what the bottle looks
like it's really sleek really easy it's
just a squeeze bottle and when you pump
it out it does have a tint to it as you
can see it's not a white or clear primer
but I absolutely adore this primer it's
a very soft silicone feel kind of primer
and what I love the most about this is
it is tinted so I was super burnt on my
face so if you see like my scout peeling
I am currently dealing with that right
now but my face was really red because
it got burnt one day and I had put this
on and it really even everything out
believe it or not like it looked so good
to the point where I could just wear
this and no foundation and I would be
fine the color correcting with this and
the foundation just really made my skin
look good and like it didn't look like I
was overly burnt on my face so I really
like
I do find that it keeps me nice and
matte and since it is such a soft kind
of formula it makes your skin feel
really smooth and your foundation just
glides over your face
I honestly can't say enough good things
about it I'm so excited that I got this
and I'm gonna have to check out some
more things from this brand because I
was super impressed by this and then the
last thing that I tried on vacation is
this shadow casino I don't hope that
translucent loose powder now I purchased
a couple loose powders because I'm kind
of tired of using my Laura Mercier
powder which I love that powder but I'm
just you know when you get sick of
products I've just used it for so long
that I want to try some new things I
decided to pick this little guy up it
just looks like this and it does have a
puff on the inside and of course the
sifter which it's a mess right now but I
really love this powder I think it is
such a gorgeous finish it's really
finely milled so it doesn't chunky on
your face it really sinks into the skin
so you can bake with this product of
course the only downfall is that it is a
loose powder so it does get messy but if
you're kind of used to that it's fine
it's not really a big deal it's kind of
just like the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder but I really like this I
don't think that it has a flashback in
photos at least from what I've seen and
then I dig at this which is kind of
random is the shaving cream for
sensitive skin it has green tea and
oatmeal in it and from the brand pro up
pro a so I don't know that's what it
looks like right there and I just wanted
to try something out that's for
sensitive skin and this kind of has like
the lock seat on squeezy tube to it you
know those little lotions that they have
that's the kind of feel that this one
has and I love the packaging of it has
five point two ounces in it so hopefully
it's good for sensitive skin I would
have tried this for like my underarms
and my legs because sometimes mainly my
underarms get super sensitive so maybe
this will help me out and then I did get
a new brush this is the featherweight
Sephora brand brush I think this is like
a bronzer brush and the number 91 by the
way I'm sorry my foundation it doesn't
match that well I have nothing to match
my tan I haven't been this naturally tan
in years
I don't member the last time I was oh
it's so soft it kind of reminds me of a
smaller version of the Marc Jacobs one
that I have
somewhere but is so soft kind of has
that dome shape to it and it is pretty
forgiving it's not really stiff or
anything and it has a really long handle
this is gonna be nice for a bronzer or
even like a face powder like dusting
away your baking or whatever I'm excited
to use this and then I got this brush
it's the RMS Beauty skin to skin
foundation brush basically it's supposed
to be like your fingertips but in a
brush so if you're like me don't like
using your foundation with your
fingertips this might be an option for
you I don't really know how this is
gonna work out since it's supposed to
mimic your fingertips basically but the
reason why your fingertips work best
usually is because the warmth of them
and you're not gonna get anything warm
and this presh but that's what the tip
looks like you can see it has like
little swirls in it so yeah this is
smallest like little foundation brush
ever but maybe I can use a for under-eye
it's pretty stiff first impression I'll
probably have to return this but I will
try it out let me know if you guys want
to see this like as a test it out
Thursday or something okay the other
powder that I try today is the KO Jindo
face powder
again this is a translucent powder same
concept does have a bigger packaging is
this more product okay so the shadow one
you can see is smaller this rochedo one
if I'm saying that wrong I'm sorry and
this is the ko Gendo the coat Jindo has
12 grams and this one has 18 grams and
you would think just because the
packaging this one is bigger but it's
not this one has more product in it this
one wasn't my favorite so far I still
want to try it a little bit more does
look a little bit more powdery on the
skin I feel like this one kind of just
sets and when you brush it away it looks
like your skin but really soft and just
a really great finish but again I have
only tried this one so I need to try it
a little bit more especially when my
skin is not so dry from being sunburned
it will have to try this but it's not a
terrible powder I just prefer the other
one over this one so far okay I never
purchased Dior lip products a day the
last lip product i purchased from dior
was forever ago and it was a lip gloss
which is amazing I think I was like the
Hydra lipgloss or something it's so good
but I figured I would try this out just
to wear like daily you know like a lip
balm or something see Dior Addict lip
glow
and it's in a zero zero one this is the
first year lip pomade SOS intensive care
with custom natural rosy tint its
breakthrough oil gel texture with a high
shake concentration provides the lips
with deep nourishment protection and
instant comfort melts in gel that
transformed into a shiny rosy oil for
immediately immediately smooth plump and
radiant lips I mean doesn't that just
sound good and look at how pretty it is
I figured I would try this out I'm all
for trying things that are gonna hydrate
my lips and it just comes out like a
light pink color again it says supposed
to transform I mean on your lips to a
rosy color but I can't try that right
now because I have a lip gloss on that
I'm going to share with you in a minute
this is the Yvonne she hide your
sparkling shine no more fluid matte
affiant protector basically it's
supposed to be a mattifying lotion or a
face moisturizer I don't believe I've
seen Gbowee have anything like this I
don't think they to cater too much to
oily skin they do have a couple great
mattifying products but not a lot so I
was excited to see this it says it's a
unique concentrated 5 molecule compound
that generates genuine sparkling water
deep within the skin it's twofold
hydrating and energizing technology
creates an effect of intense
luminescence the translucent melt away
and non oily perfecting fluid recreates
the illusion of skin free of
imperfections even from a closed a
refined texture visibly minimizes pores
a velvety matte finish and luminous
moisture it's radiant for skin that is
pure and more beautiful each day so
basically it's like your moisturizer
before you put on your makeup that's
really cute packaging I like that and it
does have a pump so again I will let you
know I'm all about mattifying products
for my face especially face lotions
before I put on makeup I don't want them
to mattifying to where I feel dry and
like the life has been sucked out of my
face
I do like ones that mattify the skin and
help control that oil throughout the day
not anything that's gonna be too intense
I have tried some mattifying products
that like really dry out my skin and I
don't like that feeling I will be the
first to say that I have not found a
talkshow product that I am really
obsessed with I did try a couple of
things but I just felt like they weren't
worth the money but I
saw this and I figured I'll give the
brand another try I know a lot of people
love this brand but I just haven't been
able to uh love it so this is the
balance pork perfecting water gel
moisturizer the moisturizer ideal for
oily skin this water gel delivers
weightless hydration to refresh clarify
and balance oily skin needs some balance
so hopefully that will do it it says to
massage one to two pumps of water gel
moisturizer over face neck and decollete
and upward strokes whoa I thought she
was she had pretty packaging this is way
prettier it's coming off a little bit
lighter on camera but it's like a
gorgeous mint seafoam color to white ooh
that is pretty but it's not about the
packaging whoa
it's definitely kind of runny you can
see that feels really good
I'm gonna rub it all over my body now
this expensive-ass moisture it's super
nothing like intense or anything it kind
of smells just fresh so I'm excited to
try this out I'll let you know
pretty pretty packaging hopefully I can
like this product this is something you
guys have been tweeting me about and
putting on Instagram that you want me to
try so I had to buy it because I think
this is so crazy I don't even understand
this I just saw it and purchased it I
didn't even read reviews I figured for a
test out Thursday it would be awesome so
if the cover FX custom block drops oil
control and it says custom block drops
allow you to customize your favorite
beauty products to have a matte finish
one drop at a time your product is
weightlessly transformed to help control
shine and your skin looking naturally
matte that is so freaking cool I tried
the cover FX custom drops the ones that
you can mix in with your foundation for
a new color or used by themselves
they're really great but I've never even
thought that somebody would come out
with custom magnifying drops like a
mattifying a foundation that's so cool I
will definitely do a test out Thursday
for you guys it'll probably be up next
Thursday but that is like the coolest
thing ever
I'm so excited to try this next up
everything is mattifying I'm sorry for
my dry skin people but summertime oily
I'm looking for new mattifying products
and these are just like all over the so
for what's new page
this is the cinema secrets Pro Cosmetics
super sealer modifying setting spray
makeup prep and set for all skin types
so as you guys know tried so many
setting sprays and nothing has really
just like stood out to me last one I
tried was the bozhe white charcoal
setting spray and I wasn't a big fan of
it but this one is just a clear product
I will definitely try it I've never
tried cinema secrets before I know a lot
of people love their brush cleaner which
I still need to try that I'll let you
know we all know I'm not huge on setting
sprays like I'm not a firm believer in
them I think a lot of it really comes
from primers and everything but I'm
gonna try to get on the bandwagon of
loving standing sprays because I'm just
having a hard time really quickly it
repurchased let me know if you guys
remember this from back in the day but
this is a clinic deep comfort body
butter I used to use this all the time I
really loved it it's such a great body
butter you can see right there really
great for dry skin I actually need to
apply it like all over right now because
I'm pretty dry but I love this yeah I
had to repurchase this just because I
saw it on the site and I was like hey I
haven't tried you in a while and it was
cheaper than La Casita next up I got a
new concealer to try out I don't know if
I've tried anything from amazing
cosmetics before but I wanted to check
this out it's the amazing cosmetics
amazing concealer and yeah I don't know
the packaging is kind of like mmm kind
of like drugstore to me but hopefully
it's good I don't I don't know if this
colors gonna match me anymore because I
didn't think I was gonna get this tan it
seems like a pretty thick concealer so I
don't know I'll have to try them that
you guys know then I also got the
Sephora brand ten art where perfecting
foundation again I don't know if this is
gonna match me because I just got like a
serious tan but this is oil free and
basically it just says that it's medium
coverage buildable and there's a ten
hour wear so hopefully this is good
stuff I really like this pump I think
I've tried the color out before I left
and it was good and now it's probably
just not gonna work so we'll see a few
more things that I purchased I know this
is super long I'm gonna get through the
PR stuff really quickly though this is
the lung
home long-lasting under-eye concealer I
feel like this has been around for a
while but I haven't tried it just comes
and I squeeze you to like this and you
just squeeze it on out let's see if this
is a little bit thicker this is really
light - I should have thought about this
one but this one has like a better
consistency than the amazing cosmetics
one it is too light for me I'm gonna
have to go to the darker shade but like
right off the bat I could tell this one
is much more creamy and blends easier
than this one this one has like more of
a you know drier texture so we'll see
okay the last thing I want to mention to
you guys I forgot I had try this out but
I didn't put it in the beginning of the
video this is AG Vaughn she bronzer in
Oh for it's the powder Mon mine I don't
know I don't know here you go I'll let
you read it this is the one I got I
actually purchased one of these not too
long ago but it was too light for me so
I got a darker shade and I'm just I
don't know I'm not a big fan of it half
dipped into it but it's not one of my
favorite bronzers I feel like you really
have to dig your brush in there to get
the product to show up on your face I
believe this is like the second darkest
shade and the line and for some reason I
just can't get it to work for me it
looks absolutely beautiful on my finger
and like when I swatch it but even there
you can tell it just doesn't show up
that much it gives a really nice bronzy
glow nothing like too intense but I love
deep bronzers they have another bronzer
that I used all the time back in the day
it was a round compact and that's an
amazing bronzer but this one just not a
big fan of will probably return this
because it's just not what I expected
moving on to PR stuff that I'm gonna
just kind of quickly get through I'm
gonna let you know if I like it or not
or what I'm excited to try and just
share some new things with you first
thing I want to shout out is the benefit
KUB KUB Rao products these are the two
that I like the most out of the line I
have tried the pencil I've tried the
other thing that like grows your brows
but these two are my favorite this is
the Gimme brow I love the original gimme
brow they just repackaged it so I knew I
was gonna like this and then this has
been my
favorite brow product I have been using
this over my Anastasio dip brow and it's
just a pomade like this I have another
one in my makeup bag that I've been
traveling with and I love it
I'm not a huge fan of this little guy
when I put it on here and I try to do my
brows I find that it's just not enough
for me it's too small but I do like the
product that is on the inside of the pot
it lasts a really long time have it on
my brows now and I think the color is
very forgiving this is in the shade 4
and since I did go lighter with my hair
I was kind of nervous that would be too
dark but I think it looks really nice
because it kind of matches my roots so
this one is a go for me
it's the cream gel brow and also the
Gimme brow are just my two favorites so
I'm going to quickly talk about to face
real quick they have set out so many
different things so this I'm actually
wearing right now is the Too Faced Born
This Way naturally radiant concealer I
like this so far I haven't underneath my
eyes I feel like it blends so well I
personally love this applicator I feel
like it comes out with enough product
some people might think that's a lot of
product on there but I personally love
it when it comes out on this doe foot
because I can apply a lot I like a lot
of concealers so I like to just put it
everywhere and I think this is awesome
it blend it out so well and it really
does look like your skin I love the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation so I knew
I was gonna love this the only thing I
was worried about is that it would be a
little bit more sheer than like my Urban
Decay Naked concealer which I am out of
I ran out over the week but this is
great I really love it it has really
great coverage so if you kind of feel
nervous to try this because you think
it's gonna be a little bit more sheer
definitely give it a try because I was
pleasantly surprised with how much
coverage this had next is the Too Faced
totally cute palette I guess it's what
it's called I got this in the mail and I
was like I'm so excited to try it one of
the shadows I actually have is a
highlight right now because i swatched
it and I was like I'm putting that on my
face tomorrow so I did decorate my
palette of course it has basically all
the food on it and a dog and some lips
but this is what mine looks like I just
kind of stuck everything on there and of
course I have the pizza one you know was
I'm not going to click the pizza one
believe there is a mirror under here
yes there's a mirror under this little
palette right here or this little
pamphlet and this is what it looks like
it has such beautiful colors this is
what I have as a highlight on my face
right now and I also have underneath my
brows and in the inner corners but all
of these colors are beautiful they are
very creamy I also have this Shea which
is bunny foo-foo in my crease then you
have chocolate donut clover I just
really love all of these shades and
again they are so freakin pigmented I
love them so definitely check out this
palette I love that they did something
where you could customize your palette
as well
these I believe are supposed to come out
mid June I could be wrong I will leave
the exact date down below but it's
called a brow quickie and it's a 12-hour
wear brush on waterproof brow fiber gel
have not tried this I opened up some
packages yesterday and this was one of
them they sent over Universal brunette
and Universal taupe I don't know how
many shades that they'll have in the
line but this is what it looks like they
have they always have like the cutest
Packaging ever okay this is the last
thing from Too Faced this is what I have
on my lips right now and I'm not gonna
wear these this is not my kind of thing
but I wanted to try it out because I've
always heard of the lip injection lip
gloss from Too Faced and I've always
been scared of it because I've heard it
is so intense and very like just sting
so much so they came out with the lip
injection glossy so the original lip
injection is just a clear gloss and then
they came out with these that have tints
to them I have on babe alert which is
just a peachy color these aren't super
pigmented it's just a hint of gloss
still a clear gloss that just with a
hint of color in it these burn like hell
literally I put this on I was like oh
bad you know whatever it was like a
minute or so and then it kicked in and I
was like oh my god no I can't I can't do
these if you love the lip injection
you'll probably love this line with the
colors and stuff in it but I can't
handle that pain this lasts I put this
on forever ago it's probably lasted
about 30 minutes and I can still feel
the stinging next I dig it to little
things from NARS they do have this
Laguna Casino duo I don't know if this
is like a permanent thing if they've had
this and they just send it over to me
this is a bronzer duo with Laguna and
then casino casinos just a little bit
darker if you want some that you could
travel with to have to contour this
would be awesome and then they also sent
over this little palette that I love
because these are like my kind of shades
and this is the long hot summer I shadow
palette this is a very bronze II warm
eyeshadow palette that would be great
for the summer times moving on oh I
forgot to mention that this I also
purchased at support as well it's a Marc
Jacobs marvelous mousse transformative
foundation this I have on right now it
says it's light weight full coverage and
luxurious now I really like this so far
I think I might prefer this with a
Beauty Blender I did apply it all over
my face with a brush but for some reason
my nose is super red some foundations
just won't cover the redness on my nose
with a brush I'll have to go in with a
Beauty Blender and then if it still
doesn't cover it up I just have to
return it because I if I cannot cover
the redness on my nose I'm gonna go
crazy so I had to use a Beauty Blender
to cover the redness the brush didn't do
it this is what it looks like it has 0.6
to 3 ounces in them which is not even a
full ounce but hopefully it does last a
while so far I really like it I will say
if you have dry skin to the point where
it's patchy you probably won't like this
because I've noticed it definitely
cleaned to the patchy dry spots that I
have on my forehead right now since I
did get a sunburn so if you do have
really dry skin just be warned that this
will probably stick to them cuz it's
stuck everywhere on my forehead but if
you have oily skin I would definitely
try it out so far I really like it okay
a couple things I want to mention from
Estee Lauder that I love that they came
out with this is the last thing I'm
mentioning or the last brand I'm
mentioning they came out with these Coco
balm coconut infused lips and I love it
I've been using Coco peach this is like
the coolest packaging for lip gloss ever
so it comes like this you take this top
off and you squeeze this and then the
product comes out this smells so good
pretty good color payoff it does have
that peachy coral color because this is
the Coco peach one it smells like summer
and it's so moisturizing and I just love
this to like pop in my purse pop in my
makeup bag because it is kind of slim
and I just think it looks so cute like
if you pop this out when you're at lunch
people like what the hell
our lips and you're just like this is
the one thing I was so excited about I
showed it on snapchat if you don't
follow me on snapchat you should i'll
leave my name right here sometimes i
show products before i even show it on
my youtube sometimes i don't even show
it on my youtube channel this is one of
the products that i was like i cannot
wait csa edit flash illuminator fluid
powder and zero one heat if you guys
remember a couple years ago they came
out with a highlighter called heat wave
and it was the it was the best
highlighter i have ever like dealt with
it was so beautiful very creamy it was a
golden highlighter and it just looked
beautiful on the skin so when i saw that
this was in zero one heat i was like
whoo maybe it's like a heat wave
alternative because this isn't as golden
as heatwave was this is what it looks
like when you swatch it it looks so
beautiful and it is a beautiful
highlighter as you can see right there
but i will say it's not as like BAM like
this one it's more of a subtle
highlighter and it doesn't have as much
Sparkle and shimmer as I would like so
I'm a little disappointed in it just
because it's not what I expected it to
be I expected it to be kind of like
heatwave amped up a little bit it's not
an ugly highlighter it's not a bad
highlighter it's just not as intense as
I wish it was okay guys so that is it
for this video I hope you enjoyed this
ginormous Sephora haul slash what's new
at Sephora I just had so much PR stuff
coming home and I figured I would show
you some of my favorite things and
things I can't wait to try out and
