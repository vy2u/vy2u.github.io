today I have my Sephora VIP Rouge sale
haul and I'm so excited to share it with
you guys I waited a few weeks to order
anything because I had some things I
needed for filming and then just some
things I wanted to try out so literally
my cart was full and ready to go the
moment daddy sale went live so I went
ahead and purchased all of it
I am Rouge so I think I got 20% off and
then regular vib sale members got be 15%
off so it was still a really great deal
all around I mean it's hard to find
deals at Sephora I have a little bit of
everything in this haul I have some
skincare haircare makeup products a
bunch of different things to share with
you guys that I'm very excited about so
if you're interested definitely keep
watching and don't forget to subscribe
before you leave and give this video a
thumbs up for Sephora hauls and yeah
let's just go ahead and get started and
I have fun packing I'm in the process of
moving the next two weeks next month is
going to be crazy but right now I have
all this sitting on top of a suitcase so
bear with me I got a lot of things that
are mu C in this haul which I didn't
realize I purchased a bunch of moose
products but I did this is a superpower
sunscreen moose its SPF 50 its
water-resistant for 80 minutes and I
love higher SPF I mean there's a limit
to SPS I forget which one it is but if
you go over its kind of like unnecessary
but I always use SPF 50 no matter what
and that was just what I use I'm a firm
believer in sunscreen I always have it
on and there were really great reviews
about this product so I wanted to try it
out they say it's not heavy and that it
sinks into the skin really quickly so
I'm all about that and excited to test
this out and see how it works in an
inside the brand superview next product
is a mousse that I'm loving it because
it's very lightweight and it sinks into
the skin so quickly and you wouldn't
think it would because it's an oil and
this is the Sephora nourishing mousse
body oil I love this and if you're going
to self tan I would recommend putting
this on before you self tan and like
letting it dry it does drive down
completely though I love that it's still
moisturizes the skin but it's not going
to read that film texture on the top
that some oils do so if you're wanting
to use something in the daytime this
would be great because it's not heavy at
all you don't feel it on your skin but
it is very moisturizing so I've been
using this for the past few days since I
got it and I loved it I think it is so
good and
highly recommend it also if you're
wondering this makeup look I did just
try a bunch of different makeup products
it's a full face of first impression so
stay tuned and pre filming some videos
that you will see it very soon next
thing is something I have not tried I'm
very excited to try it out because I
love this brand this is Natasha de
Nona's full coverage fruit complex
foundation I got the shade 42 hopefully
it will match me at some point in my
self-tan process but the packaging is so
adorable I love it's just a white cap
and a frosted bottle and then it does
have a pump so I'm excited to test this
out I will definitely keep you guys
updated
I love foundation so I'm always down to
try some new ones next up is this Tom
Ford bronzing gel I've never used this
before or anything like it so we're
going to see what this looks like it did
just felt and a few hours ago I like
applied it a few hours ago and so that's
why my neck is kind of blotchy and
everything but we'll punch the mist on
our hand to see what it looks likes and
a really cute white bottle of course I
love that what is this what is just
after eat this but look at how dark it
is bronzing gel hope this doesn't make
my hand extra tan because uh look it's
making a I think this is a self
tanner hmm let me get off my fingers we
do not want orange and so oh god
it says mimic a sunkissed glow with Tom
Ford Robin gel gives the complexion of a
healthy-looking touch of color and the
water-based oil-free formula blends
easily without skin your skin's natural
features it's formulated with Tom Ford
skin calming and is using complexes to
calm and comfort the skin the Soleil
inspired since it blend can also be used
all over the face or simply wipe it onto
the places the Sun would naturally hit
your face your cheekbones bridge or your
nose in the top of your forehead I'm
going to try this out on my chest and
stuff and see how it works and I will
definitely keep you guys updated so it
did blend in really nicely okay I mean
you can even see it on my hand and it's
very lightweight drive down completely
dry which is crazy in like a matter of
minutes
so I'm going to try this out and keep
you guys updated probably music want on
my chest in my neck and shoulders and
not my face I'll let you know what I
think of it next up is a makeup product
this is being etosha de Nona eyeshadow
palette and this one is the palette
number 13 this one out of all of them
just kind of drew me in I love her other
palettes so much and I wanted to test
this
that's all it is so bringing all like
these are all the colors I ever need in
my life like this green this color oh my
gosh this is so gorgeous of course of
course they're pigmented and beautiful
so this is what they look like I cannot
wait to play in this palette you guys I
just really love our eyeshadows and
always feel like it's worth some money
so I definitely want to test these out
and I feel like they're going to be
amazing
and I'm going to be mentioning this a
lot to you guys and they are decent
sized pans they are pretty big and
they're going to last you a long time so
I cannot wait to put this on I might
take this to my LA meetup this weekend
so if you're in LA come to my Meetup
I'll leave all the info down below next
up I got this for an Instagram made me
buy it video that I'll be filming a next
week for you and it is the farfalle
unicorn essence I've been trying to buy
this forever now but it's always sold
out on Sephora so I'm super happy I was
able to pick it up this has been talked
about so many times and you know they do
the drops when they go you know so I
can't wait to test this out look at the
inside yet until the video it says that
it's an innovative solution that acts as
a dual purpose serum which infuses the
skin with beneficial skin care while
prepping it for layering moisturizer or
makeup application it contains four
super fruit extracts rich in
antioxidants impact a vitamin C which
helps make the skin appear visibly
younger and healthy looking you can use
it before your moisturizer or use it as
a primer it's continuous redness or
irritation occurs let's hope that
doesn't happen
as I opened up this for an Instagram
made me buy it and I might as well just
pull this one out because I bought this
as well so this is the hourglass vanish
seamless finished foundation stick I
tried this before and I did not like it
when I first tried it but I have only
tried to want so I figured I would pick
it up again and use it for that video
and just test it out one more time to
see if I can make it work pick this one
up in the shade warm beige and afford
the video I did pick up these before
cake and bake liquid and powder and
makeup sponge I just want to pick this
up in general but I mean I see it all
over Instagram too so Chrissy it is good
I also take that two of the black beauty
blenders this is the Beauty Blender Pro
I love this more than all the other
Beauty blenders I just think it's great
I do love my L'Oreal sponges but I
wanted to pick up just a couple more of
these Beauty blenders because they're my
favorite so I just got to one of them's
been put to work the other ones we're
just going to wait on this one they get
a glowing hydration body oil I have not
just yet but I can't wait to test it out
at night because that's what I like to
use oils like this this is the herbivore
Jasmine glowing hydration body oil if
it's jasmine by the oil is a blend of
natural botanical oils that leave your
skin glowing and hydrated with an
intoxicating intoxicating floral press
okay made with thousands of this still
held OH
oh my god I love this made with
thousands of distilled petals of the
night blooming Jasmine variety this
precious oil provides an all-natural
intoxicating scent while increasing
skin's moisture retention oh no about
you I love florals in the moment I heard
that this is amazing and floral I had to
have it looks so luxurious too
oh yeah that just smells like floral
like it just smells like a flower it
doesn't smell like any other added sense
are mixed in with it it just literally
smells like flowers like if you pictured
a flower garden in front of you and you
just smelt the flowers that's exactly
what it smells like so I can't wait to
put this on so next up I did get a new
perfume I was at the PX and I saw this
and I sprayed it and I loved the way
that it smelled and purchased it them
but I decided to go ahead and purchase
it off before when it was discounted and
this is the Chloe love story for fumes
this is definitely in my opinion more of
like a mature scent but I really like it
I don't know something about it I just
really love this is the packaging is so
pretty
you take that bar down oh I love it I
love it I love it I love it so again
this is the Chloe love story perfume so
good and then I also got another one
this is beep in rose a little dipper
perfume or au fait de parfum and this is
supposed to smell like peony lavendar
sandalwood aka my three favorite things
ever packaging is so cute it is pretty
small but I've never tried anything from
this brand so I didn't want to go big or
go home you know oh it smells so good oh
my god it smells so good I love it so if
you're into florals I think you would
really like this I know I went on a
perfume frenzy and then I saw online
that Victoria's Secret came back out
with the summer bombshell perfume so I
bought the big-ass bottle of that
because I used to love that perfume so I
think I'm stocked on perfumes now
--except is something very different
this is the prenup instant
right hair mask now I thought that you
were supposed to apply this when your
hair was dry but you're actually
supposed to apply it when it's wet it
says inspired by a splash mask this
high-powered in shower treatment
performs like a traditional hair mask
but works in under a minute which is
very nice because you know how sometimes
you have to let hair mask like sit on
your hair to really make it work totally
this works in less than a minute and it
says a multitasking mix of moisturizers
include Amla oil and replenishing
Kapooka butter you know words deep
conditioning repair and strengthen hair
it's 360 spray simple application
ensures hair is coated evenly every time
leaving hair looking and feeling soft
smooth is shiny from roots to end as you
need a prenup at least once a week if
you've got chemically treated or colored
hair or your heat tool attic shampoo
with warm water squeeze excess water
from hair spray mask evenly from race to
ends comb through with fingers or Wye
tooth comb and rinse with cool water
immediately for extra date conditioning
leave on for 2 to 3 minutes I can't wait
to try this out first off the packaging
is adorable I hope you guys updated I've
been looking for a new hair mask so I'm
very excited to test this out and just
see what the smell smells like you know
and then I also got this before
moisturizing body oil now I have been
using this and you can see because I
want to kind of test it out before I
came on here and did a haul and I have
to say I'm not obsessed with it like I'm
going to continue to use it but it's not
as moisturizing as I thought it would be
and you can't use it in a sponge or
anything you just have to use your hands
and apply it all over your body I just
don't feel like my body gets a good
cleanse you know I don't feel very clean
after using this and I don't feel like
it's very moisturizing I'm going to keep
just you know using it up but it's not
my favorite and I've only used it a
couple times and I'm down that much
alright next we have another with dry
shampoo fo have been trying the way one
and I'm not obsessed I want to try this
out and just see if I just don't like
foam dry shampoos you know or if there's
something that could be different so I
just got this detox one by dry bar dry
bars really well known for like killing
it with hair products I did repurchase
the smudge proof eyeshadow base because
I'm running out of mind by NARS I love
this stuff I use it all the time and I
also repurchase the larger-than-life
long wear eyeliner this is just a pencil
liner that I really love and it stays on
my waterline all day so lovest I always
have a back
of it and then this is something
different this is Eva Tasha Dona
blackest black eyeshadow and it's a
matte color this is like intense okay
some of her palettes that I have don't
have a nice matte black in here and I
was like oh maybe this will go well with
her eyeshadows because her formula is
really great I really like it like I
told you guys before damn nothing is
black totally this is the blackest black
eyeshadow ever and ice all really good
reviews I'll know about you that is
black what do that oh I might you don't
see any skin through that I think it's
great to have a nice and matte black
eyeshadow that you swear by and that
will blend really well so I'm going to
test this out see if it blends well see
if it works with all my other palettes
and I will let you guys know and I think
the packaging is so pretty and it just
like screams this eyeshadow is bomb so
hopefully it's all alright just a few
more things I do have the Sunday Riley
CEO micro dissolve a cleansing oil I've
used this a couple times so I'm gonna
let you know a little bit of what I
think this is the product right here
very cute packaging I'm not obsessive it
I don't know why I just don't feel like
it really takes everything all like with
this makeup look it's really heavy so I
know I'm going to have to take like the
clinic takeoff the day cleansing balm
that's really going to break everything
down
I feel like this just doesn't break down
my makeup as well as I wish it did it's
not terrible it's really pricey and I
would just prefer to stick with my
Clinique one so that's just my little
update I feel like I haven't had that
much luck with Sunday Riley product yeah
this is just not my favorite just to be
honest with you guys I feel like there's
better affordable options so I just want
to put that out there and last two
things are from a new brand at Sephora
which I actually just got a whole order
in I want us to sale was still going on
when I ordered that cuz I didn't get
enough push in the gel crap so well you
guys know I ordered so much stuff from
the new brand pretty vulgar on Sephora I
will definitely be doing a first
impressions for you guys testing that
out for you because they have some
really cute packaging and it's brand
spankin new and this is also another
brand that is new at Sephora this is
called stellar this is a limitless
foundation I had ordered a foundation
from them before but the color was off
this was in the shade so4 and this one's
a little bit better for when I'm not as
self tanned actually wore this the other
day and I think it's nice
play more of a medium to full coverage
foundation I wouldn't even say it can be
full coverage just a higher medium I'm
more like a dewy look to it it didn't
really last that well throughout the day
all my skin but I'm going to try some
different mattifying primers with it and
see if I can make it work but so far
it's not terrible it's just not my
favorite for my skin type and then I
also got this where I have not tried
it's the stellar cosmic face powder and
glow oh one this is just a loose powder
again with that nice matte black top so
yeah I haven't tried this out I don't I
think this is a highlighter or maybe not
maybe it's just a setting powder but I'm
going to test this out let you guys know
anything ok guys so that is it for this
before a vib Rouge haul I hope you guys
enjoyed it I feel like I never buy
things when it's the vib Rouge time like
I always forget that the sales going on
and I always miss out but I was finally
able to pick some stuff up on the
discount so very excited about these
items if you've tried any of the stuff
out let me know in the comments below
what you guys think and yeah thank you
so much for watching I will see you guys
in my next video
