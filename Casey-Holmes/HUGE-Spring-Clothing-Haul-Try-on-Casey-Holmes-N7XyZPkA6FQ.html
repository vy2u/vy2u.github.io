a haul it's a huge spring clothing haul
asked you guys a while back if you
wanted to see this and a lot of you said
yes so I figured I would show you guys
now keep in mind this is a collective
haul I did not buy all this at once some
of this stuff took like a couple months
to get in just because I ordered it from
Australia or something like that
so yeah most of this stuff I do leave is
still online I believe I've seen a lot
of it so you should be able to pick it
up if you're interested in anything
yeah I'm just going to go ahead and get
started with hope look though I got two
pairs of shoes from HauteLook that I'm
really in love with and they are by the
brand Dolce Vita they're these cute
little strappy sandals I love the fact
that they have a chunky heel and then I
love the detail right here of the wrap
up front and then wrapping around the
top of the foots really cute and then
just zip in the back and I got this off
of the Nordstrom Rack section on
HauteLook and I love the fact that they
have a Nordstrom Rack on there it's
really awesome but if you guys don't
know the bomb is on HauteLook I'll leave
the link down below I think they're
still going on but they were on they
started a couple days ago and who looks
basically like a flash sale side so they
have brands come on for a couple days
and then they scoot them on out so it's
kind of like you have to catch them when
they're on there but I love these shoes
actually bought them in black as well
and I wear these the other night and
they were super cute and I just love
them a lot I always got to get another
pair in black if I really like the shoes
okay next place is five or twenty one
five or twenty ones like one of my
favorite places ever even though I do
think that forever 21 is kind of going
up on their prices which kind of sucks
but I still really like their things and
I do find that a lot of stuff is
affordable so I still shop there I'll
show you what I got on line first the
first thing I got I'm a huge comodo
cardigan kind of fan so I get a lot of
them for spring and summer this one is
super cute it's like a lace crochet mix
not too long of a little kimono is the
perfect length and I think that I'm
going to pair this with like a lime
green strappy tank and like some white
washed shorts it's going to be so cute
for summer this one was 20 to 80 but it
is pretty great quality so I like that a
lot
now I want to go ahead and say I have a
ton of rompers a ton of floral print
just be really obsessed with floral
print ever since probably about November
it's just one of my favorite things I've
been buying it and I used to not like it
at all and then all the sudden I've I've
been feeling kind of girly my style kind
of changes like I'll be girly one
a more grunge the next day and it's just
I don't know I like the mix of two as
well so yeah and also a lot of rompers
because they're super easy to sow in the
spring and summertime and they're just
really cute so this is the first romper
from forever 21 so really pretty floral
print romper and I like that it's
basically black with these cute little
flowers on it and it's super lightweight
too so that's great for spring/summer
and this one was 1780 and this one has
daisies on it I really like the way this
one looks
I like the collar of it so this is the
top of it so you can see has the collar
and then the button downs and then you
have the drawstring in the middle and
you also have little pockets on the
front of this one and you also have them
on the back I've never seen a romper
with pockets in the back so I thought
that was really cute and this one was
again 2480 and this one's more like a
heavy material but it is really nice
quality the rest of this stuff is from
in store on at forever 21 so again with
a kimono I got another one this one is a
really pretty floral print as well and I
like this one because I don't have many
cropped kimonos and this one is cropped
so it's super cute to pair with pretty
much anything and yeah I like this one a
lot and this one was 1980 which I feel
likes a little bit pricey for this item
but I really liked it so I decided to
get it also got some PJ's from forever
21 cause I've never had any PJ's from
them so this is the first pair you have
just these plain grey shorts I got this
one in a medium I got the other ones in
a small so I don't know if I just picked
the wrong one up but yeah that's the
medium and then it comes with this
really cute tank with like little dogies
on it and I like their little PJs
because they're really really soft and
they're really nice and for a top and
bottom they're 1280 so that's really
affordable this is one of my favorites
this one has like burgers hot dogs and
like pizza on it so that's the shorts
and then the top says party all day
snack all night and I like that their
shirts are
nice big boat neck tops so it's not like
up against your neck making you choke at
night I hate when shirts do that to me
at night so love the fact that they're a
nice little boat neck top and then the
last one that I got it comes with these
little Daisy print shorts and then the
shirt just says amour on it with little
daisies in it as well so that's just
what that looks like
okay now this shirt I really love I love
the pattern of it and I love the color
it's just really pretty flowers and like
little birds in there and I love the
burgundy red color and this is going
cute with just like plain pair of shorts
super casual and this one was pretty
affordable
it was 1280 it's really soft so I like
that so next is this sequined kind of
pastel pink top I love the detailing of
this it has really pretty scalloped ends
I just like the color of it it's really
nice I like toss like this for if I'm
going out I can wear just like some
jeans and this does show like maybe an
inch or two of your tummy so it's not
super cropped but it is just a little
bit to kind of make it a little bit more
sexy and yeah I like this one a lot easy
just to dress it up or dress it down and
this one was kind of more expensive it
was 30 to 80 so I was a little bit
frightning I also got this shirt and it
says easy come easy go and I like it a
lot it's just really casual and I like
what it says on so this last thing that
I got from forever 21 is another beaded
top and it was 32 80 again and I got
this one in a large because I like them
to be on a medium so they're not super
tight around my chest area because then
I kind of find that it makes them stick
weird on my body so they only had a
large in this and I decided to get it
because I loved the pattern of it and
again this one does show about an inch
or two of your stomach so that's what it
looks like it just has different kind of
beading and sequins on them and then it
also has it here going towards the back
as well so really liked it I thought it
was super cute and I can't wait to wear
it would just like some regular jeans or
black jeans you know you could do so
many things with stuff like that okay so
next I went to a store called body
central it's in my local mall
don't know if they have these everywhere
but it's a pretty affordable place to
give them stuff
I don't usually pop in there but I
decided to since you know they have a
bunch of new spring clothing and I found
a couple of things so the first thing is
this really cute floral top it is a
hi-low top as you can see I love the
color combination of this because it's
like a nice topi nude with gorgeous bold
floral print like I just I love the
color combo of this top I think is super
cute it's really nice and tight on your
arms but it is a little bit baggy at
your waist and it just fits really
nicely I don't have the tag on this but
I know it's pretty affordable I wore
this in my first spring makeup tutorial
so if you want to see that I will leave
that down below this one I'm going to
use like as a swim cover-up is just a
pretty little chiffon dress type of
thing it just has a cute little strappy
detail here in the back and then the
really pretty chevron print as you can
see and this one was nineteen eighty so
yeah I just figured this would be great
to kind of toss it in the pool bag if I
want to go eat I don't have to come home
change I can just toss this on go get
something to eat and then go back to the
pool and then this top is super cute
this one was fourteen ninety and I loved
the cute little sunglasses on it it just
seems so summery to me the type of
glasses that I like are right here the
kind of cat eye with the round ends I'm
pretty sure it says deja vu on the end I
don't know but I'm pretty sure it does
okay now I'm going to show you guys
things I got from the site necessary
clothing I love that side I'm always on
there shop there for a long time now and
they have a pretty affordable stuff as
well some things can get a little pricey
but for the most part it is pretty
affordable so the first thing I got was
this nude cami but I love it because the
end looks like this so it kind of has
like that crochet end and I love the
fact that it's pointed if you have a
larger chest like I do I would go with a
medium because if I'm a size 26 inch
waist but I do have a larger chest up
top and I've got a small and it was just
really tight and it didn't sit on the
body nicely so when I tried on the
medium it just fit really really well
and look just so gorgeous so that's what
this one
looks like now I've been shopping a lot
to try to find my IMATS outfit and I
have found my outfits so really excited
this is probably the outfit I'll wear on
Saturday and it's really cute because
it's super bold and this is what it
looks like it's just really bright
floral print with those kind of
scalloped edges as well and has cute
little button detailing here on the back
and it's not showing as bright as it is
in person but it is super super bright
and I just I absolutely love this and
then I got the matching shorts to go
with it so this is just what they look
like they're really nice kind of
high-waisted shorts I'm good I ordered a
size small so those should be coming in
these are the mediums and they're just a
little too big so I think the smalls
will fit perfectly and yeah I'm really
excited to wear those fry mattes if you
guys don't know I'm going to Emmet's New
York so I hope to see a lot of you there
I think it's sold out but I'm excited to
go okay next up I have this shirt just a
really simple casual shirt has like the
muscle sleeves you know where you can
see inside but it says always wear your
invisible crown and pretty sure I saw
like this picture on Facebook and I
loved it and was it's on a stair
clothing how to top like that I was like
yep I'm gonna get another really good
thing about necessary clothing is they
have a bunch of different basics and for
spring and summer they have a lot of
bright basics and I think they're super
cute so this is a really pretty coral
chiffon top it is not even coming off as
bright as it is but like I said you guys
to see the pictures of it but it's a
really cute top
kind of high-low as well and these kind
of talks are easy just to throw on and
go out the door and still look who's
super cute this was a romper that I was
considering to wear - I - but I decide
not to but I liked it so much that I
decided to keep it so it looks like this
it kind of has this netted detail here
on the sleeves and in the front and it
goes all the way down it's kind of like
a creamy peach color and then in the
back you just have a really gorgeous
exposed zipper and this fit really
really well so I can't wait to wear it
during spring and summer last two things
from necessary
clothing I got another one of those
little basic chiffon tops in white if I
can get it going there we go
so really cute just simple chiffon top
and white and these are super flowy and
they fit really well on the body and
then I also got a little tank top that's
really simple but it just has really
cute details so it has a zipper in the
front like the two little buttons and
then again it goes down to like a
high-low okay moving on to nesting out I
actually posted a picture of this on
Instagram of me wearing it and I had a
ton of comments wanting to know where it
was from this is what it looks like it's
just a lace kind of top with cute little
tassels I'm a huge tassel fringe fan
this is what it looks like so really
lightweight material and I had a lot of
people ask me how I wore this like with
the bra and I actually got a white lace
bralette from Nasty Gal and that's what
I wore this and it looked really cute
and you couldn't like seeing the bra it
wasn't like stand out since it was so
nude and it was really thin another top
from Nasty Gal is this really cute white
basic top I love the sleeves on this
because you have this like little cutout
right here so makes them a little
different and then you have an open back
and it shows your lower back which i
think is super flattering
I loved this shirt it's really pretty on
and then this top I really shouldn't
have bought because it looks like a rat
ate it but I really liked it
so it's just a simple muscle tee and
then you have like all these different
kinds of cutouts and it just kind of
looks grungy which again my style I like
to change it up be more grunge be girly
you know just switching it up and then I
also got this top from Nasty Gal which
this is probably my favorite top that I
got - super cute cami like this and then
again you have kind of like the fringe
here at the bottom and this looks so
cute with jeans because it looks like
it's super super cropped but with the
tassels and everything it covers up a
lot of your body okay next I'm going to
show you guys stuff I got from Nordstrom
this is from the juniors part of
Nordstrom online and I got this cute
little cream basic cami it just wraps in
the front and also does like a wrap
detail
in the back this you can dress it up
dress it down it's just like one of
those staple pieces that you have in
your collection now this top I plan on
using as another swimsuit cover-up it's
a bright neon orange color and it's not
looking true to color at all on camera
because this is so bright in person but
that's why I love it it has like this
netted feel here in the front and then
it also has an open back so it's really
cute but again I think I'm just going to
use this as a swimsuit cover-up and then
I got this little tank I love these kind
of colors for like when you're tan like
with your dark hair I just think it's
really pretty it's a token blue kind of
tribal print tank and again this one is
hi-low as well just a simple easy tank
to kind of put on and throw over
anything and then the last one that I
got this is my favorite thing that I
think I got from Nordstrom because it's
super bright and girly so this is what
it looks like it's like a bright
highlighter basically it's so lime green
and then you have this crocheted overlay
in the front and it's just a white
crochet overlay so again it's not really
showing up true to color but in person
it is super bright Pizza ordered two
things from Lulu's the first thing is
this simple tank with like little loving
flamingos on it every time I went to the
site I saw these little flamingos and I
was like I want you in my life so I
decided to get them this is a pretty
large tank this is a size small so I
would have probably gone with an extra
small I don't know if they even have
that size but yeah they do run really
large so just be aware of that I got
this cute little top again cream color
and it has this cute little detail here
where you can tie the straps up which
which is nice because sometimes you know
straps like to fall down and then here
on the ends you have this hassle detail
which I'm obsessed with this I would
wear this with jeans because the tassels
are so long but it's like if you wore it
with shorts it would just kind of cover
up the shorts and it wouldn't look I
don't know it just wouldn't look right
to me so I would pair this with like
some jeans and it would be good to go
okay next is stuff that I got from Toby
and
I noticed that I have a huge mink pink
fan I didn't even realize that almost
all of the robbers that I got from
different sites were the brand of mink
pink until I actually looked at them so
like I said these are from Toby I'll
leave all the sites that I mentioned in
the description box this is my favorite
one of my favorite top two rappers I
have two rompers I'm just completely
obsessed with and this is one of them
and it just has like this gorgeous print
on it with puffs of neon orange has the
drawstring can't get over this romper
I'm so excited to wear this it's just
stunning
I think the puffs of neon are just
really what makes it because it's just
oh I love it and then I got this
jumpsuit this is my first jumpsuit that
I've ever purchased and I love this I'm
going to have to get like a taupe or a
nude belt to put in the middle just to
kind of break up the print a little bit
but it's really cute Daisie print and it
is a long jump suit so that's what it
looks like and these look really cute
with the nude heels I showed you guys in
the beginning and yeah it's really
lightweight so it'll be great for the
springtime and then I got this little
duo from Toby as well and I'm actually
going to pair these together so the
camis just looks like this it has little
leather accents right here and then the
rest of its just like a chiffon fabric
and I got these little faux leather
shorts I've been wanting some shorts
like this so I finally got them and they
have little lace accents here on the
sides now this is the other romper that
I said that I had my top two this was my
other all-time favorite romper this is
from the brand princess Polly or the
website princess Polly and this is the
Australian based brand and I'm obsessed
with this romper so this is what the
romper looks like super cute I just I'm
obsessed with the print and I just love
it has like a little bit of floral print
in there some stripes it's a halter top
and this is also from the brand made
pink so I just I love that brand okay
then I got these shorts if you're a 26
inch waist I would definitely go with a
size 6 because these are a little bit
big on me but I love the shorts wide
side keep them this is what they look
like it's just a mixture of polka dots
and some fool
oral print I think this would look
really cute with just like a plain black
cami and then some like heeled wedges or
something and then I got this Daisy
print top this is what the front looks
like I just love it it's all daisies
this is a hi-low top as well the last
thing I ordered from is from ASOS so
this is the last site I'll be talking
about today the first thing I got was
from the ASOS petite collection and this
is a romper and it just has really
pretty sunflowers on it it's just a
mixture of sunflowers and polka dots and
I just I really liked it a lot I was
thought it was really cute this is a
little bit big on me I got a size us six
but it is a little too big so I'm gonna
have to get a belt with it I think I'm
just going to go like a really dark
royal blue belt just to kind of cinch in
the waist but I liked it a lot okay this
is another rubber this is from the brand
pink again I got off of ASOS and this
one just has some Chevron mixed with a
little bit of flowers and has a really
nice drawstring here in the middle as
well this is another one I'm gonna use
as a swimsuit cover-up I believe this
one is from River Island I'm a huge
River Island finned as well yeah it is
from River Island so this is what it
looks like it has cute little palm trees
and it kind of goes from the purple to
like the blue and green and it's just
cute just a nice little swimsuit
cover-up
then I got another rock board this one
is from the brand neat pink on ASOS as
well I like this one because it looks
like we're just pairing a plain cream
top with these really cute shorts this
is actually the back but this is what
the shorts look like so this is just
another easy outfit you can throw on it
looks like you put two different items
together when really it's just all in
one now this one you guys are probably
going to be like why are you wearing
your grandmother's curtain and I love
the way that this looks I think it's so
feminine I think it's really appropriate
this is another thing that I was going
to wear to IMATS but I didn't want to
return it because I really like the way
that it looked and I figured I could
wear this whenever so I love this
I no longer probably hate it and think
it's my grandma's curtain but with the
dark hair and like a tan some really
cute shoes yes so
I know people gonna be like oh my god
this is what it looks like this is from
ASOS as well it's from the brand lavish
Alice and it's just a really nice
form-fitting romper now also has like
these really cute flat details here on
the side and it's just a really
flattering romper and I'll do a little
close-up of the pattern so I couldn't
return this I wanted it so bad and I
love the fact that the shoulders are
kind of pointed I think the kind of
sharp shoulder look is really strong and
feminine and it's kind of like bring it
on I got some strong shoulders I don't
know I love this and then the last thing
whoo we're almost done with this haul is
this romper again from the brand mink
pink got from ASOS and I like this one a
lot because it's very very very
lightweight so it's gonna be great for
summertime and just looks like this with
the drawstring tons of floral okay guys
so we are done with a spring clothing
haul I don't need to shop for any more
clothes at all because I'm set I do this
thing every season where I'd go through
my clothes and I get rid of things that
I don't where I'm either I'll donate it
take it took assignment shops whatever
and I pulled out a lot of my spring
clothes this year and I was like oh my
gosh I have like no clothes right now so
that's why I purchased a bunch of things
because I do that every season like when
falls completely over and it's
summertime I'll go through my fall
clothes and get rid of things that I
just don't use so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this haul I'll leave all the
sites that I mentioned it down below in
the description box and yeah thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed it
if you want me to continue to do the
fashion hauls then give this one a
thumbs up and I will see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
