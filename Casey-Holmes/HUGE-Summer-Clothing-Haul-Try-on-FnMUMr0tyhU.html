a summer clothing haul I've gotten a lot
of stuff recently for the summer time
and I'm really excited to show you
because it's a lot of cute stuff and I
figured I would share with you all some
of my favorite shops lately so yeah I'm
just going to go ahead and get started
because we've got a lot to go through
and if you're wondering this top is
actually a dress but you're not gonna be
able to tell and I'm wearing shorts
underneath this is from forever 21 oh my
by the way I did film this makeup look
if you want to check that out I'll link
it down below obviously I just switched
tops which is not very sneaky but I do
need to do my hair but I wanted to get
this video up for you guys because I
haven't done like a clothing haul in a
while well that's what I did was a
spring clothing haul and if you guys
want to check that out I will leave it
down below but this stuff's a lot
brighter and a little bit more fun so I
definitely wanted to share it with you
the first thing I want to talk about is
shop hopes that I have discovered this
site but within the past month I'd say
because I purchased quite a bit from
them I started following them on
Instagram and I've just been purchasing
from them a lot it's like a boutique
kind of shop they have super super cute
girly things if you're a girly or you
like kind of colorful bright things you
would love this site I will have
pictures of this stuff on on the sides
so you guys can really see the details
so the first thing I got is this skirt
and it doesn't look as bright on camera
but it is so neon and colorful it is
just beautiful it's a gorgeous maxi
skirt like I said I'll have a picture
for you guys and it does have like slits
on the side so it's really feminine and
this skirt does have like a underlining
and it ends right here and then the rest
of this is just sheer so it's really
cute really nice for summer the next
thing that I got is this adorable green
shirt this is like a neon green color
again not showing that true to color but
you will see in the picture of how
gorgeous it is I was expecting this
shirt to be like cotton in a way but
it's not it's actually really nice I
didn't expect it to be this great of
quality so I love this so much it's so
cute and I got it to go with some shorts
that I'm going to show you guys the next
thing is this adorable shirt and I love
this so much because it's really unique
and I'll have anything like this it just
has this really cute cig zag design on
it and then the back just opens up
you can see it just kind of splits down
and I like it a lot especially ones that
expose the back so I'm excited to wear
this little guy now the reason why I
really love shop copes is because
they'll pair different things together
and you can buy those things
individually and they're all really
close to each other so you're not
searching for like a needle in a
haystack it's all pretty much right
there with that outfit so this is like a
rubber type thing but it's super girly
and feminine and they had it paired with
this adorable necklace even if I don't
run this romper this necklace will be
used for the fourth of July I have to
say this is the only site that I've
gotten necklaces from that I've actually
worn or want to really wear soon so like
I got this one from them really quick
someone show you guys I don't think is
on the site anymore but I wore this in
my summer makeup routine video and it's
just like a gorgeous gold fringe
necklace and I love this so I got this
necklace it's super cute really bold
they had this paired with this Romberg
this runner is really hard to see
because it's like got criss cross see
details but you guys will see in the
picture it's really cute and flirty next
up I had my eye on this really gorgeous
like color-block maxi dress it's just
gorgeous it has like some nude up here
with the gray in blue and then cinches
in at the waist and this part is really
flattering how the blue kind of goes
down like this and a die angle is it
dangle or diagonal these diagonals but
how it goes down like that it's really
flattering and then it just goes down to
the ends and again this one does have
like these skirt underlining here and
then it's a really sheer at the end
which you're not going to see on camera
and it has also nude at the bottom I'm
really trying to get into dresses
because if you guys have been following
me you know I'm not usually a dress
person because I just I'm not that girly
I guess you could say I've never been
into dresses this time actually plan on
wearing to a motocross event I'm going
to at the end of this month because it's
gonna be freaking hot and I plan on
wearing this because it's netted so
you're gonna get a lot of air blowing
through I love this top actually got
this in a large because it was only size
they have
and I love this shirt it's just so
pretty and I love crochet tops like this
I've actually purchased quite a bit of
these because I think they're really
cute with a band oh for spring and
summer so definitely pick up a crochet
top because these also look really cute
with high-waisted shorts I plan on
wearing this with a pair of distressed
high-waisted shorts and it's just gonna
be super cute oh this is another one my
favorite tops I've been putting all this
stuff aside because this is definitely a
collective haul so I forget some of the
things that I've gotten but this top is
so adorable especially with some
high-waisted shorts
it's a gorgeous mint top with this
detail here in the center and then it
also has this little fringe tassel
detail on the bottom love love love love
love this top alright next up is this
dress now this dress I kind of I love it
but I don't know when or if I'm gonna
wear it because I'm bigger chested up
top I'm a 36d whenever I wear certain
dresses and they send you another way
sometimes it can make me look bigger
just because my chest is largers but
this dress is a really cute one so this
on the model was so freakin adorable
this is what the top looks like you can
see it just has like a tribal print and
a color-block and this is where it
cinches in right here and then you have
this gorgeous neon coral kind of bottom
this dress is adorable but unless my
boobs get smaller I don't think I'm
gonna wear this and then the last few
things I got from them are shorts and I
love little pretty colorful shorts and
this is the first pair I'm sorry you
guys can't really see the color of these
even if I turn the lighting down on my
camera it's just it's not picking up but
these are a really gorgeous kind of like
pastel mint color and they have like a
crochet detail at the end and then the
last shorts I got are to go with that
other green top I showed you guys but
they're just green and blue shorts I
love the kind of elastic waist that
these have okay so the next place I
ordered from is Windsor and I absolutely
love Windsor I always had to forget to
shop on there but every now and then I'm
like oh hey I have a shop down there in
awhile which is kind of good because
then I see a lot of the new stuff going
along with the skirts trend
I did get this a navy skirt which is
really cute I would wear this as a
high-waisted skirt I think that's how
the girl wore it on the site but it's
just a really nice maxi skirt again you
have like the underlining mini skirt and
it ends about right here and then the
rest of its really flowy and this one
has lace in it so it's kind of like a
peekaboo skirt it's really really
flattering and really cute and for a
casual day you can just pair this with
like a loose white tank and some sandals
and be good to go this is on my favorite
items I got from Windsor just because
it's so cute and it fits my body so well
like a lot better than I thought it
would this is just gorgeous cream and
dress and it does have really pretty
lace inserts in here and as you can see
here at the bottom it has like that
sharkbite bottom so it's kind of shorter
in the middle but longer on the sides I
feel like you could wear a nude bra and
nude panties and totally get away with
this or you could because it does cover
up quite a bit or you can wear this over
your bathing suit but it's such a nice
quality that I feel like I would just
wear nude undergarments and be good to
go this is one of my favorite tops I
like I said I love the netted stuff
right now so this one's really cute it's
a little bit thick so on a really hot
day I am not wearing this but this looks
gorgeous with some high-waisted shorts
so this is just that kind of netted
crocheted top and then again with the
tassels on the end I'm a huge tassel fan
I love it if you saw my last haul you
could see a couple things that had the
little fringe detail okay so the next
thing I got was this adorable little
cami you can see it kind of has these
scalloped ends and a one layer is a
little bit shorter than the last layer
and I love this a lot you can pair this
with so many different things I love
little delicate pieces like this the
next thing I got is this dress actually
got it in blue as well on Windsor but I
got this because I actually ordered a
white version of this on shop lately and
this was like 20 dollars cheaper so it's
kind of like really if you want this
dress and you've seen on shop lately
get it on Windsor because you'll save
you some money but this is what it looks
like it just has a gorgeous lace top
like this and then it's really really
loose and
it has this lace detailing on the bottom
super super cute again you compare this
over a bathing suit or just wear a
strapless bra be good to go you can even
belt it and it'll be really cute because
it is such a flowy item this shirt is
absolutely adorable this is a bright
coral top with a crochet underlay and it
is just so pretty it's kind of just like
a peekaboo thing so you can see a little
bit of your stomach through the crochet
but not bad at all
and I just love it isn't it adorable
last thing I got going along with the
crochet trend is this gorgeous mint
crochet top oh my gosh this is so pretty
again with some high-waisted shorts I
love this so much I love the neckline I
love the sleeves everything about it is
just beautiful it is a little bit pricey
but I mean I just love it okay next up
I'm gonna show you guys things I got
from whitefox boutique or is it boutique
I used to think boutique but boutique so
I'm going to show you guys these items
that I got from them and I think they're
an australian-based brand so definitely
check them out these shorts they're not
very summery but I think they're super
cute with like a black tank they kind of
it feels like a skirt they're so flowy
but these are the first pair of shorts I
got they're kind of like a flannel type
of thing really cute I mean you can make
this super casual I also got this
t-shirt dress that just has this
gorgeous flower is this the lotus flower
it looks like a doughnut I don't know
but this is so pretty I love the pink
and purple together and I love the fact
that it's a shirt dress because once
again you can dress it up or dress it
down you can wear it with heels you can
wear with sandals just for a casual day
and I love this and it's really really
soft so it's super super comfortable so
I got three more shorts from them the
first one are these babies and they have
sunflowers on them
I love these shorts and the pom-poms
it's just all of it it's just super cute
I love it again I'll probably pair this
with a white loose tank and I just think
they're so adorable they fit really well
too and then I also got these shorts
they're a little bit big on me I got the
in a size 8 but they'll work fine I'm
gonna have the elastic band and then
they just have this gorgeous flower and
butterfly print on them and I love the
scalloped ends as well again you can
just pass through the black tank and it
looks like you tried hard when really
you didn't and then this has to be one
of my favorite shorts that I got because
I don't have anything this color
these are super green and I love the
lace detailing at the bottom they have a
few of these shorts and different colors
with the lace trim and I'm telling you
this is so feminine when it's it's how
it sits on your leg it's just really
sexy and feminine and really beautiful
so I love these shorts so much then I
love this romper I actually had this
romper but I've decided to get it again
in order in a different size because my
other one was too small around my chest
area it was like suffocating me so I got
this one in size 10 and this is a
gorgeous black romper that I'm just oh
my god I love this romper
has amazing lace details at the top in
the waist goes in as well and then you
have again that gorgeous lace that will
drape over your legs and I'm telling you
it's so feminine you guys I love rompers
like this and then I also got this item
it is a romper this doesn't look that
great on me um my waist
it doesn't like I don't have a body
that's like a coke bottle waist it
especially fine getting like the first
place I'll gain weight is my waist and
it will just go like this it will be
straight so this one my hips are going
in just a little bit because I have been
losing some weight but this still
doesn't look that great on me I don't
know I'll have to see if I can figure
out a way to wear it but it has a really
cute off-the-shoulder detail and a
crochet overlay and it has an
underlining to it as well so you can't
see through it this doesn't look right
on my body and then the last thing I got
is this top I love their basic tees I've
purchased quite a bit from them that are
just their basic tees and they're really
great quality like this is so soft and
it sits on the body really really nicely
okay now the last thing I want to show
you guys is ASOS and I just I love ASOS
it's one of my favorite places to shop
the returns are
easy buying stuff from them super easy I
mean I just love that sight I've never
had any issues with it so the first
things I got you guys actually saw me
wear the white one of this in my
products I've used up video and they say
this is a beach wear top search was to
wear it over your swimsuit but honestly
you can wear a nude bra underneath this
or just wear a bra left and it looks
really cute which is that's what I'll be
doing but it's a really delicate fabric
and I just love this so much this one's
in the mint color I think it's super
feminine and I got a size us 4 if you're
wondering another thing I got from ASOS
is this gorgeous cami and it's like a
terry cloth kind of feel I don't know it
it's definitely a little bit thicker
it's nice quality again you kind of have
the layering thing going on and it's all
scalloped this is just really cute I
wore this not too long ago and it looked
really gorgeous on and then I got this
crop top from ASOS this is a gorgeous
pink crop top with some rolls sleeves
and this again looks gorgeous with some
high-waisted shorts kind of reminds me
of like the 80s in a way because you got
the roll sleeves and then you were cut
off it's just so fun and cute so I got
this from ASOS as well it's a really
nice material supersoft another top I
got from ASOS is this really pretty
white tank has this sheer panel here at
the top and the buttons going down and
it's just a great simple basic I love
love love this top next up I got this
little duo I love the print of this it's
a gorgeous kind of sherbert orange color
with some little flowers on it
and I love this so much so I got the top
and the bottoms to match and they're
really really cute this has the elastic
band in the back and just a plain front
and this just looks like you're wearing
a romper and you're really not so it's
super convenient when you have to go
potty because whatever you wear a romper
and you have to go to the bathroom it's
like you have to take it all the way off
but this looks like you're wearing a
romper but you're really not so I love
pieces like this I've been buying galaga
than lately and this one is definitely
one of my new favorites two basic tops
from ASOS and we will be done with this
haul this one is a really pretty kind of
it's color it's more like it's a really
nice mix of blue and green
I just love so much super soft material
you guys it's very lightweight but this
the quality is amazing I don't remember
how much this was I don't think it was
that much though but this is beautiful
and the way it fits on your body is just
amazing so I got this stuff and then I
also got this really nice this one some
people would say it's like a puke green
but I actually really like it and I like
the fact that this is open right here so
then I prepare like this necklace with
it and it would just be super cute so I
love this top again you can tuck it into
some shorts or some pants and look
really put together we're like nude
heels with it okay guys so that is it
for this collective summer clothing haul
