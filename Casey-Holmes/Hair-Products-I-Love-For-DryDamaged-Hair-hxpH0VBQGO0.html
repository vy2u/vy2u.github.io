hair products that I recommend for dry
damaged hair I also put some styling
products in here just to kind of show
you guys what I really like to use and
I'm gonna go ahead and dress it you can
obviously tell that I have switched up
my background I now have my vanity in
the background and I don't know if you
can tell the lining
I did get some new lighting I'll put the
name in the down bar and I got it on
amazon.com if you're wondering but I
hope you guys like it I'm kind of trying
to step up my game a little bit I also
ordered the Canon Rebel t4i which should
be coming in very soon
and after that I'm ordering a new
editing system so hopefully my videos
will be better for you guys I just
really wanted to kind of step up my game
because we don't know I did hit 50,000
subscribers so thank you guys so much I
really appreciate it it's just so
awesome hitting 50,000 but I will have a
giveaway video soon for you guys and I'm
also going to do an updated makeup
collection I asked on Twitter and
Instagram if you're interested in a lot
of you said yes so I just look forward
to that video in the near future but for
now I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys
some hair products that I recommend
though the first thing I'm gonna show
you guys things that I recommend when
you get out of the shower I talked about
this one before this is a twelve
benefits instant healthy hair treatment
I actually just purchased my new one
like a couple days ago when I went got
my hair done which by the way excuse it
is like super blonde right now but it'll
die down in a few weeks like I always
say but I love this stuff it's really
been great for my hair I even had one of
the stylist she was washing my hair she
was like that stuff is doing wonders for
your hair my blonde actually is really
nice and healthy for it to be bleached
so this has played a huge part in that I
don't know where you can get it I know
my stylist always has it on hand
especially when I come in and she's
really great at just telling me that she
has it not only paid ten dollars for it
but I'll try to look for it online and
if I find it I'll put it in the downbar
next product I recommend I've been using
this every single day since I got it and
I love it it's the healthy sexy hair soy
try wheat leave-in conditioner I am in
love with this stuff it is fantastic
this stuff seriously makes my hair so
soft it's probably one of the best
leave-in conditioners I've ever tried in
my life and I dig it out Ulta and so for
ten dollars
I don't know how much it is retail
regular retail price but I really
recommend trying this out if you haven't
yet I know TJ Maxx and like Marshalls
has it
JJ max I know for sure I've heard
Marshalls but I am not too too positive
but try to look there if you're
interested in buying this for sort of a
cheaper price or just check out your
nearest Ulta okay next is oil and I
mentioned this I think it was my oddest
favourites I really love it it's the new
me repair intense pure remedy oil it
doesn't have any parabens or anything
like that which is really great but this
is what it looks like it is pricey but I
promise you is so worth it it's probably
one of the best oils I've ever tried in
my life it's better than my macadamia
one that I have and I just love to put
this on my ends like I said in my August
favorites you only need the littlest
amount because it can make your hair
really greasy if you're not careful so
just be careful with it put a little bit
in your ends and you will feel like the
difference in your hair it's so crazy
okay the last product I recommend for
when you guys shower is the gardening
foretaste triple action nutrient spray
this is what it looks like it kind of
has like - I don't know what you would
call that it's like it has like the oil
or something at the bottom and the water
on top you know how oil and water don't
mix but before you spray in your hair
you just shake it up and spray it all
throughout which I love this because it
smells so good and you can definitely
tell that it makes your hair softer
don't garni forties um on the bottom of
most of their products they say like I
don't know if you can see this but it
says for dry damaged hair I don't know
if you can see it but if you have dry
damaged hair look for stuff like this
because it's gonna help repair your hair
and trying to make it more healthy and
stuff but this stuff is amazing it
smells so good makes my hair super soft
and it's great I think it's like four or
five bucks at the drugstore so super
affordable and Garnier Fructis is just
honestly a great light anyway so love
them okay for he protect it I recommend
the got to be guardian angel I've shown
this before I love this so much it's
really great I love the fact that it
says 425 degree he protected because you
kind of know you know how high you can
go with your Heat and this will help
protect your hair from it I don't use
for honor
25 degrees on my hair I use probably
about 325 350 at the most but this is
really really nice and it does protect
my hair and I think this is under six
bucks maybe I don't know I know it's
super affordable that's okay so if you
have really dry hair I don't recommend
you know washing your hair everyday it's
just not good for your hair especially
if you have color treated hair it's just
gonna help strip the color out even more
I recommend a dry shampoo so the one
I've been really really loving lately is
this one
I hate say the name but it's just a dry
shampoo you can get this at Walgreens
and I really really love it it's one of
the best like spray dry shampoos I found
I really like this it does give you some
volume and it really does help soak up
the oil make your hair look really
refreshed so I highly recommend this is
like 647 at Walgreens I do believe and
then also whenever I have second day
third day hair and I've curled my hair
or something or even when it's straight
I like to use this on the ends of my
hair to make it soft again because
sometimes my ends will get really like a
dry feeling and just like not feel as
healthy as the rest of my hair so this
is the got to be oil ishes this is the
dry oil taming mist so this is what that
looks like I love this stuff so you
don't have to put like a real oil in
your hair like a really thick oil you
can just spray this on the ends and kind
of brush out the ends and you're good to
go I'll just make your hair look shiny
again feel a little bit more healthier
and just help you get to you know go in
two or three days without having to wash
your hair I don't recommend put this on
your roots because of course it's the
oil it's going to make your hair looking
more oily I really recommend this just
don't use athletes they'll ask you are
just styling products that I recommend
of course I mentioned this in my August
favorites I'm almost out of it I have to
go pick up the full size this is the red
can wax black tin this is just a wax
spray and I love this I love this more
than like the wax that you get in the
jars and you have to kind of dip your
fingers in I love this because it's just
so easy to use you just spray it work it
with your fingers you know put your hair
wherever you want it and you can go this
is basically like my hair spray and like
it just holds on my hair in place adds
texture it's just all of that in
so I really love this stuff I highly
recommend it I love the smell it just
smells good to me it smells like a salon
but the red can wax Boston is amazing
especially if you're curling your hair
it's a must-have I really recommend you
try then the last thing is a volumizing
powder I always have to talk about one
whenever I talk about hair products this
is the big sexy hair powder play and
this is what it looks like this is a
little bit more pricey than why I prefer
but it's a really awesome volumizing
powder I got mine at Rite Aid because I
like to sticker all their stickers on
the back of stuff um but this is awesome
it just gives you a lot of volume and it
also gives you some added texture as
well and if you don't want to tease your
hair or anything like that I definitely
recommend a volumizing powder because it
will sort of have that same effect that
teasing look it's just better for your
hair choose a powder than it is to just
use you know a teasing comb and just
like tease and break the strands of your
hair basically so I really recommend
this if you're in the market for another
volumizing powder this is one of my
favorites so that is all the hair
products I recommend I hope you guys
