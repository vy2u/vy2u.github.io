a haul and I'm gonna show you guys just
a few things I've gotten recently and
I'm ready to put this stuff up so I
wanted to go ahead and get this haul up
now let's just go ahead and state the
obvious I did dye my hair ombre as you
can tell I did this Friday and I really
really do love it my friend Jessica did
it for me
I'm known her for years and I wouldn't
already for a long time and I hadn't put
bleach on my hair for a year I'd say cuz
last year in January I went completely
brunette so I loved it it's such a good
change I really think it just like
Lyman's up my face my friend Jessica
works at a hair salon near Atlanta so if
you're interested in checking it out
I'll leave the link down below and her
information we did not touch the root up
here this is all the lush cherry shade
and once we did like the golden ombre it
really brought out that lush cherry
color especially in the sunlight so I'm
just really happy about it just go ahead
and get started with the haul I want to
show you guys things that I got from the
toy secrets and an annual sale I did
purchase some other things but they're
already put away so I figured I would
just show you guys these I got these
over the weekend the first three items
weren't from the semi-annual sale but I
just had to have them because I love
them so first off these shorts they are
so cute they're super flowy they're 100%
polyester and I got these in a small I
didn't realize that the flaps were
folded in the hangar because this is
what it looks like but I figured I keep
it just because it has this drawstring
so I'd be able to tie it up tighter but
these are so cute and they just remind
me of spring and summer aren't they
adorable
so got those and then the other two
things I absolutely adore these sports
bras I got one for Christmas and ever
since I've just been obsessed and I want
like every single color no lines they
are the Victoria oh it's the incredible
vibratory secret sports bra
these are pretty pricey but I promise
you if you work out a lot it's totally
worth the money because it gives you
really great support if you're gonna run
or if you're gonna do anything like that
you need good sports bras especially if
you're you know bigger chest up top so
this is the first one I got you can see
it does have the wire underneath and I
love these because they're really
well they have like this class in the
back so it's kind of like a bra if you
feel like it's too tight on the first
class you can go down to the third one
and it'll be looser for you and you know
make you feel more comfortable so I
really like these I get mine in a 36d
that's just my size again I dig it one
in lime-green and it kind of has like
this netted feel to the front now they
do have a few of these sports bras in
these semi-annual sale bins I don't even
know if they still have that going on
but if they do have this to me and
you'll still so sales still going on
they do have these in the bins and they
had the one that I already have and then
this was the only other one I can find
so it just has like this flower print
and these are $20 so it was $30 off and
it's just I mean it's a cute pattern I
really like it and it's gonna be cute
under some tank tops okay now moving on
to fashion items I posted a picture on
Instagram with a beanie on and asked you
guys if you knew of any like good stores
with beanies because I've been looking
for some cute ones and this site
actually contacted me and asked me if I
wanted to pick out a couple things and I
did and I don't have to show these in a
video but I think they're super cute so
I got this beanie because it's literally
me and a beanie it just looks like this
and it says can you not that's probably
my most used phrase ever um just because
I always say that like can you not so
this is super cute the brand is Lauren
Alexandra in New York and I also got a
shirt from them that says East Coast
I'll put a picture up right now I posted
it on Instagram and I absolutely love
shirts like that that just have like a
bold saying in the front and of course I
live on the east coast so I had to
represent I'm really loving these
products that I got from them and I'll
leave their link down below if you wanna
check out their site okay next I want to
show you guys some jeans that I got this
is from the brand standards and practice
and this brand is like really well-known
for their jeans and they have like so
many different kinds of jeans so many
different textures prints and I'm really
in love with this site like I am so
happy with the way they fit the jeans
are so different from anything that I
have I really like them it's a really
cool site so the first one I got these
are just some dark blue jeans and then
they have like the black snake
skin I love it because it's bold but
it's not too in-your-face and I love
them they're skinny jeans I will be
trying these on for you guys the next
one I have so many pairs of black jeans
and I wanted another pair that were kind
of different so these are just little
black jeans with like kind of a chevron
print not necessarily Chevron would be
like a messy Chevron but they just have
a really cool pattern to them now this
pair is kind of different they kind of
feel like leather pants like a little
bit of leather in there I don't know
it's really hard to explain but I love
the color the color is like a dark grey
and these are so nice I love the way
they fit and I'm telling you they just
have like a like a shine to them I don't
know what they call these kind of jeans
but this is a great Jean I like I'm
obsessed with these they're so different
from anything that I have and they feel
really cool I can't get over it and
these are just you know your regular
dark washed blue jeans with a little bit
of fading in the front and I love these
I love the way that they're like sewn
together because they're a little
different you can see this theme right
here and then I also got just a regular
pair of dark wash jeans because you can
never have too many dark wash jeans and
again I really like them super super
soft so it's just what they look like
okay so next I got a couple things from
ASOS a lot of the stuff I've already
worn from them so I'm just gonna show
you guys these two let me just go ahead
and say my favorite brand from ASOS is
River Island like every time I go on
that site and I just scroll through the
clothes every little item that I click
on is usually River Island like I just I
don't know I really like their stuff so
this is a first top from them I
absolutely love how busy it is this was
so cute with a pair of black jeans just
to be nice and casual tuck it in and I
love the sleeves because they're like
that cuffed look and I like this a lot
super cute it is kind of big but like I
said I'm going to tuck it in and I'll be
fine I got a size eight I'm really bad
at like converting sizes from like us to
UK and things like that you don't know
exactly how their size is gonna fit this
one is a little too big but it'll be
fine especially in the summertime tucked
in some high-waisted jeans it'll be cute
and then I got this shirt as well this
is also from River Island and it just
has
like the mesh here in the cleavage area
and on the shoulders and the top of the
back it's just a cute little simple
white top and you can spice this up make
it casual make it dressy so I really
like that okay next I got a couple of
things from Express and I had to return
quite a bit of things just because their
shirts fit really weird which I'll show
you guys here in a minute but this is
the first top it's just a plaid front
with a really gorgeous gold zipper and
it's super lightweight it has a plain
back and I really do like this I believe
this is so on the site I don't think I
got this on sale and then I got this one
I actually got the last one of this
shirt because it was on sale for $10 and
I snatched it up now it's just a camel
color shirt but the score just kind of
like faux leather top with like the
little holes in it and I had a bunch of
different shirts like this come in from
Express cuz I ordered them but if you
can see at the end it kind of flares out
this one isn't as bad as the other ones
but the other ones would literally like
go out like this and that does not
flatter me at all this one was really
nice it's just a little bit flared out
but you can't really tell when it's on
now next is from H&amp;amp;M I did wear one of
my little dressy hoodies I'll put a
picture right here it's just like a red
little hoodie I don't know exactly how
to describe it because it's not like a
hoodie material from the middle of your
waist it just has lace and then it goes
here to the elbows of your arms as well
so it's lace right here on your elbows
and lace right in the middle of your
stomach it's super cute you could dress
it up I just I think it was adorable and
there's only $10 and then I dig it this
one I have another hoodie that is like
this in white but I just love it and I
think it says chaos I'm pretty sure it
does it's just that all black sweater
and it has these gorgeous plates with
just the letters on it and I love it
it's super cute and I also got this this
is when they had a sale I did not get
this for $50 I got it on sale for
probably 20 or so and it's a gorgeous
kimono as you can tell I love kimonos I
have one on now this one's from forever
21 it's a really nice quality kimono
like it's got some weight to it and I
just really love this I think it's
adorable
and then the last thing I got from H&amp;amp;M
actually have this in black but I saw
they had this one on sale and white and
it just
has the kind of crochet up at the top
and then you have these gorgeous sleeves
and it's just a super laid-back top I
have the black one and a small but I had
to get this one in a medium because they
didn't have any other sizes but I think
I can make it work just like tuck it
into some jeans or some shorts and now
I'm going to show you guys some bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks stuff I stocked up on candles
again even though I really don't need to
stock up on candles like I have plenty
so the main reason I went in to back the
body works is to stock up on this candle
these are on sale for $8 at the store is
the Dolce scent I love this because it's
sweet
but it's not too sweet and it just
smells so good I don't have to like open
my patio door or anything because it's
overwhelming which I love that it says
an irresistible Italian treat is
captured in a delectably fragrant pure
blend of pure vanilla bean rich caramel
and fresh cream and all that together
sounds like it would be really strong
but it's not this scent and harvest
coffee which I stocked up on harvest
coffee - they are my two favorite scents
I just adore them because I can handle
the scent like it's not too much so I
picked up two of those and then I did
get two things from the fresh picked
line and usually I don't really find
stuff I like in there but I saw these
two and I really liked them I love the
smell of like lilac and once I saw this
I knew I was gonna love it it's called
lilac blossom and it just oh it smells
so good Blanco lily of valley blossoms
and violets around much like in the
springtime fragrance oh my gosh it
smells so good I love fresh scents I
love kind of flower scents as long as
they're not too much I'm gonna love them
and then I got this one because it just
kind of like reminded me of my childhood
it's called honeysuckle bouquet and it
smells like a honeysuckle bush it says
this scent of early spring contained in
a bouquet of sweet honeysuckle and pink
peony with a touch of creamy vanilla I
got four of the new scents - I got one
of the sense I got two of but they do
have their summer candles back out and I
loved that they had candles I love her
mashter back out I was gonna get
Caribbean escape but it smell so much
stronger than last year I don't know I
didn't pick that up again but this one's
Tiki Beach it says
since as warmest sunrays a luxurious
blend of toasted coconut vanilla musk
and resort glamour it just it smells
like the beach like if you're at the
beach and you have your coconut oil on I
need a vacation yeah I love this scent
definitely recommend it Tiki Beach is
one of my face and then this is one of
the newer ones I don't think they've
ever came out with these I could be
wrong but I've never seen them before
this one's called Tokyo petals it says
ice sake and cherry blossoms an exotic
combination of Japanese ice sake
delicate cherry blossoms and a hint of
berries has that berry smell but it's
not to bury like I don't like too much
of a berry scent this one smells clean
with a little bit of berries I mean I
really really like that and then this is
the one that I got two of and it's
called Sydney Harbour and it says
experience Australia's most beautiful
Harbor City with a blend of salt waters
exhilarating eucalyptus and bamboo wood
visit the lamb down under this one just
smells very very very clean you know I
love those and now I'm going to show you
guys some makeup products that I
purchased and this is just you know a
collective kind of thing I'm going to
show you what I got from Nordstrom first
and the first thing I got I love my
Bobbi Brown tawny blush but I was really
interested in this one it looks super
bright online and it is very very bright
but it is so pretty on the cheeks for
spring and summer this is gonna be such
a beautiful color and it's called
apricot I love Bobby Brown blushes so
much because they're very very pigmented
but yet they blend really well at the
same time I have for this a couple times
and you'd only need like the smallest
amount like just use a very light hand
with it and once you get it on your
cheeks you can just blend it in and it's
beautiful so the next thing I got was
this Mac extra dimension skin finish and
magnetic appeal this is from that
magnetic line they have out like the
nude line I forget what it's called but
I have superb I've got quite a few
things from that collection and usually
I'm not the type of person to buy things
from collections but everything in that
collection I pretty much love especially
the lipstick I have it on today it's
called close for comfort I think but I
saw this one I didn't know about it at
first but once I saw swatches all night
I went looked up some things I really
liked it it's kind of just like a gold
bronze
and I think this was just to be really
pretty on the cheeks and I really like
these extra dimension skin finishes I've
never had them before until this
collection and now I want them all
especially whisper guilt because I've
heard so many people talk about that
shade but I love this this is so so
pretty and the last thing I got from
Nordstrom is this Chanel foundation this
is the matte lumi a long-lasting soft
matte sunscreen makeup foundation I got
the color 40 beige I also got another
color just to kind of see what color I'm
gonna be and I love the packaging and if
you guys want to see like a review or a
first impression on this let me know I'm
gonna see which shade fits me best just
let me know if you want to see your
first impression on this because I'm
thinking about it but it's all up to you
guys if you want to see it or not okay
next things these are also going to be
products I'm doing first impressions on
this one will be up this Friday this is
the Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge
I wasn't upload this last Friday but I
just got so busy I didn't have time I've
been doing pretty good I'm doing my
first impression Friday's until that
Friday so I plan on doing this one this
week I'm really interested in trying it
out and a lot of you requested to see a
video on this so it'll be at 2 this
Friday and then another thing is
something you guys requested numerous
times it's the Urban Decay Naked skin
foundation and the reason why I never
purchased this is because I'm just like
a huge fan of light coverage foundations
because usually I want stuff that's
gonna cover up like my redness or bad
acne or something but I figured I would
try it out I mean I've heard great
things I have no idea of this shades
gonna match me or not I plan on using it
when I'm nice and self tan so we will
see but yep this is in my first
impression board and then this one I
want you guys to let me know if you want
to see a first impression on this
because it's kind of a different product
to do a first impression on it's the Too
Faced bulletproof brows 24-hour
waterproof cashmere clay and bulletproof
brow brush so basically it's just like a
waterproof brow product I got the color
universal brunette which says shade
might be a little dark for me since I
went on break but I'll just use a light
hand with it so yeah it has the cutest
packaging ever you open it up and then
it says bulletproof brows Universal
brunette then you pop that top open and
you have the product on the inside
I think that's really great because
sometimes cream products can draw it
really fast and this looks like it's
gonna help keep that from drying out as
quickly so very excited about that okay
so that is it for this haul I hope you
guys enjoyed it
give it a thumbs up if you want me to
continue to do hauls every now and then
and again thank you guys so much for
watching I'll see you in my next video
