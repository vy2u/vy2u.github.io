thing I wore my 25 questions tag but I
really wanted to film some videos today
for you guys and get them up for you and
one I've been really wanting to do
lately is my well say 25 question tag a
howl that I did and I did I'm just elf
and like I went to Mac and I bought five
Mac lip products but I ended up not
loving them so I'm returning forward and
keeping one and I do have one on right
now which is kind of fading and I'll go
ahead and show you guys that one and
it's from the news shop cook when I
recall it it's like a bunch of different
things collection is called innocence
beware I love nudes and this is
seriously one of my favorite new to um I
don't know I'm seriously just in love
with it because it's not too nude
nothing it's just so pretty
I love this color seriously I love this
color so well by the way that was a
cream cheese though okay so what I got
from elf was the first thing I'm going
to show you is this fan brush I got one
because I've never had one before but
I'm not a big fan of this I feel like
it's way too flimsy and it's not really
gonna put the color right where I want
it I don't know
I don't know I'm half about it but hey
it's something to get me free right so I
did get that it was like three dollars
from Studio line I got this one oh my
gosh I was so excited get this it's the
elf complete coverage concealer I want
to get this for a while and I finally
just got it and it looks like this I got
a medium I love the fact of there's
different shades in there like there's
darker ones and lighter ones it's just
really great and honestly I used a
couple leaves lighter shades yesterday
after I got enough work just to touch up
underneath my eyes and it worked so well
so I love this such an investment I dig
it to elf powders and I got them in two
different colors so they didn't know
what color would work for me and I got
it in almond and caramel or caramel I
say caramel but some people say caramel
and this one is almond and this one is
caramel like that so I mean this one's
just a shade darker and then you got
this you lift it up there's not a mirror
there there's just a mirror on this side
if you see lift it up they give you like
a little puff and stuff so I'm just
gonna keep them in there cuz never know
when you're gonna need it so got those
two I did tried this um or I didn't try
it I decide to try it it's the elf High
Definition powder it's just that
transparent powder they have this
packaging is so oaky it's ridiculous but
it comes a little puff and of course
that's a transparent powder in it I'm
just gonna poke a few holes in here or
like lift it up halfway because I don't
want a huge mess but I want to try it
out cuz I heard some good things about
it and I just wanted to see what the mic
was all about I got this blush I'm
really in love with this blush and it's
called berry mary because you have
squashed it but it is so stinkin pretty
and it's not like shimmery it's just
it's very subtle I mean it is shimmery
but subtle so that's it right there it's
super pretty I'm really in love with it
so I think this is one of my favorite
elf blushes that I got
then I know and one of my homes I showed
you guys I got the tinted moisturizer in
almond I went back and got this one in
sand because this is the only one like
this one matches me the other one's a
little too dark
so that one be great for summer this
will be great for now and then I got
this I've had this before and I really
liked it and it's just the elf
waterproof eyeliner and it does have a
felt tip on the end but seriously I love
this stuff like look at that it's really
great I'm going to show you a couple
things that I really loved that I got at
Rite Aid not too long ago like maybe a
week or two and I'm only showing two
because these are the two that I
seriously am in love with so I did get
the NYC liquid liner I've been using
this I used to mi I don't know if I used
at my tutorial but I did use it it might
get ready with me it is so nice y'all um
it just has a little tip like that as a
brush tip but look at this it is so
black like literally so black and it was
only like 2 or 3 bucks I love this I
love this more than the where's it at
then the elf liquid liner I love it a
lot more than that so this is good I
love it then another thing is my
favorite powder I've been using that it
got not like a week ago
and that's the I showed this in my get
right with me to cover talks 10 face
powder Physicians Formula and
transparent medium and just looks like
that I love this I love it so much more
than the Rimmel one because the Rimmel
one really pulls like shows you the like
kind of white transparent color and
don't like that this one is seriously so
transparent it makes your skin look
beautiful I'm just in love with it see
it blends out so nicely leaves your skin
looking flawless I do have it on today
on top of foundation I'm just in love so
I totally recommend now then I want one
opinion from you guys
I bought this the other week when I
bought this stuff and it's the concealer
101 from Physicians Formula I want to
know what you guys think of this
haven't tried it because I'm sort of
scared it's definitely not a creamy
concealer and this is the yellow light
or yellow yeah yellow light you should
post with the yellow underneath and then
put them medium or the light shade on
top a look it comes out like I don't
understand so if you use this let me
know if you like it because I'm afraid
to try and tell you here's some opinions
on it but I got that it's kind of
expensive for it to be falling at the
Sun I don't know I have like a love-hate
relationship with Physicians Formula
it's just really insane so that was my
haul I hope you guys enjoyed it and I'm
gonna go cuz my fiancee called and it's
like he's waiting for me so I guess I'm
gonna stop filming right but yeah I will
see you all in my next video and don't
