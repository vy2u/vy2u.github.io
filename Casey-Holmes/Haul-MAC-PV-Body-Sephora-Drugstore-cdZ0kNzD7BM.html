a haul I haven't done a haul in a while
so I figured I'd show you guys what I
got and this is a definitely a
collective haul I didn't buy all the
stuff at once it's just kind of
throughout in the past couple weeks
I got this stuff and I have a couple
sites to tell you about ok so the first
thing I want to show you guys is nail
polish I got two new nail polishes or
three can i count the first nail polish
is this orally polished in oak vanda boy
and this is actually what I have all my
nails right now I'm in love with this
color if you could tell like all the
bright colors I'm wearing I'm so ready
for summer it's unreal and this color is
just so vibrant and pretty and I love it
so this is called a cabana boy next
color I have is super pretty as well I
think because I got these two at Sally's
and they were I think buy one get one
free I'm pretty sure and I think I think
it was buy one get one free but this
one's called bubbly bombshell and it is
just a gorgeous like shimmery purple
pink color I thought it was beautiful it
is kind of sheer but I feel like over
this color it would be so pretty and I
love this color it's just gorgeous
so this is called bubbly bombshell and
then I got one more this is kind of
similar to the lat the bubbly bombshell
but it has bigger chunks of glitter in
it and this is called fuchsia and this
is from Milani and I got this one su yes
so that's what that one looks like it
just has more of the chunky glitters in
it the next thing I got I got ride a
this is the prestige I don't know if you
guys have ever heard of that brand but
it's the prestige tow intensity against
all odds'
liquid eyeliner and this is what the
little ball looks like this is about $10
at Rite Aid which is kind of expensive
for just a little liner but this is
obviously in purple and I didn't think
it was gonna be that big of a deal until
i swatched it on my hand and it is so
beautiful and super pigmented for a
purple liner cuz usually I feel like
purple is such a hard color to get to be
like very pigmented and this has like
little shimmers in it as well it kind of
looks like bubbly bombshell but in a
liquid eyeliner form so this is what it
looks like it's just beautiful and has
like a really nice shimmer Sheen to it I
just really liked it so I picked this up
again I don't really know the lasting
power of it or anything but hopefully
it's good and it's called till oh five
around the clock
it's called around the clock next time
when Walgreens and I saw these lashes on
sale and I've been really interested in
these lashes they look so cool and I
just haven't picked him up these were
only a dollar like 49 so I had to pick
them up it's the Ardell double-up lashes
these are number 201 and I just I
thought these looks so cool they're
super super thick and what I'm probably
gonna do is cut them and use them as
half lashes because I love half lashes I
wear those more than I do full lashes
they just look more natural on me and
since I already have long lashes I don't
really necessarily need the full strip
for my eye so I'll definitely probably
cut these up and try them out and see
how they work but they're super thick I
thought these were just cool so I'm glad
I picked those up and then the last
thing I got drugstore wise is this
Rimmel BB cream nine and one now I did
try this out and I don't like it at all
this one's in medium dark and it says
there's a nine in one skin perfecting
super makeup I tried it out once I got
it and I hated it it was way too orange
for me and it just didn't look right on
my skin at all I the reason why I even
picked it up is because it was medium
dark and it would match with my tan like
when I self tan or whatever but it was
just really really really orange so I
don't like this product and I don't
recommend it now moving on high-end
stuff I did go to Mac and they had the
new collection I'll have to figure out
what it is and I'll put it in like a
little annotation or whatever here but
I've got two things from the collection
they had a mineralized skinfinish and
like stereo rose and I wasn't gonna I
didn't pick it up that day I was like
I'll pick it up you know next time I'm
up here and when I left I could not get
that minimized skin finish out of my
brain I wanted it so bad so I got Colt
to go up there after he got off work and
they were sold out like the next day I
was so upset I'm really sad I missed out
on it it was a beautiful beautiful skin
finish but I dig it
two things from the collection and the
first one is this mac mineralize tinted
lip balm and this is in stay warm this
is beautiful it's like a nude pink and
it has gold shimmer in it I don't know
if that'll pick up on camera but this is
such a gorgeous lip balm it is very
moisturizing and I really like it so I
got that and then the other thing I got
from that collection is this Mac blush
and this isn't gentle and this is like
right up my alley this is my color I
love it and it's a pink with a purple
undertone kind of more towards the
purple side oh my gosh I saw this and I
had to have it so that's a swatch of it
right there and I just I love it it's so
pretty
oh I love I knew I had to get it and it
is a mineralized blush if you're
wondering then the last thing I got for
Mac's a pro long wear lip glass now I
have a regular lip glass in Flor
abundance and I really really like it so
I thought I'd try for a longer one and
this isn't patience please and this is
definitely a very sticky sticky formula
but it does stay on for a long period of
time and you don't need a lipstick on it
or under it
I mean you could like I'll put kirinda
nude underneath and put this on top but
that's what it looks like right there as
you can tell you really don't need a
lipstick because it's super pigmented I
like to put lipstick underneath because
it's so thick it's hard to like rub your
lips together like you're like it's so
hard to rub your lips together with this
thing but it really does stay put and I
feel like if you're gonna go for the pro
long wear lip glass I would say go with
a lip gloss first and see how you like
the lip glass in the stickiness like
I've gotten used to it so now I love
them that's why I decided to pick up
more of a long wearing one we gotta
start with the regular glasses and then
move on to the pro longer ones just so
you kind of know how sticky it's gonna
be and then from Sephora I just got a
few things the first thing I got is just
kind of it's not a repurchase but I've
had it before this is the hoola benefit
bronzer and I used to have this as a
little sample but I decided to finally
pick up the full size though this is
what it looks like if you don't know I
absolutely love it this bronzer and Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer on my too
favorite high-end ones NARS Casino used
to be one of my favorites but it's
really really dark for me now that I did
repurchase a NARS powder this is in
beach and it's a lot lighter than I
thought it was gonna be I used to wear a
mountain all the time but I figured
since I wasn't as dark as I used to be I
should just go down to color and this
turned out really really light I just
use this in the center of my face to
kind of keep it highlighted I'm still
gonna get mountain but Beach is still
really nice I don't regret buying it at
all because I like putting it in the
center of my face and then I got two
blushes because I'm obsessed with
blushes and I can't help myself and this
one I saw SML Stefanie she talked about
long time ago in a hall when she got
this and it is actually called Lovejoy
and it is super super pretty I love this
color if I'm gonna wear this I will
definitely skip on the bronzer because
it is so pigmented and it kind of just I
don't know it kind of acts as a bronzer
so that's what it looks like right there
on my knuckles and I really love it it's
beautiful and it's so pigmented and long
wearing
NORs is just the balm and anything so
I'll of the NARS and makeup forever I
like my top two favorite high-end brands
because they're just amazing and then I
got one more blush from NARS this is
called dowser I do believe and this is
just kind of a dusty rose color which is
perfect for every day I think it's
beautiful and this has become one of my
new favorite blushes as well it's very
natural and just very very easy to wear
with any look so that's it right there
let it if you have any blushes that you
recommend that are sorta like DS then
let me know because I'm down for trying
new blushes so that was it for all my
beauty items now to talk about the
websites so I did subscribe to a new
subscription service and it's called PD
body calm and no they did not send me
this I purchased my subscription last
month just so we could put it out there
cuz I know they've been sending a lot of
people's stuff but I actually purchased
mine if you were wondering they didn't
send me it for free if you follow me on
Twitter Instagram and Facebook stuff
like that you know that I love working
out I work out all the time me and my
fiance to the gym we don't work out
together we do our separate workouts but
I love going and every time I go out
shopping at all
forget to buy a new workout clothes and
it's like it's so annoying because I
hate wearing like the same stuff over
and over again like I wash them but I
mean it's just I get tired of wearing
the same stuff but this description
service is so I can get a new outfit
every month so I'll have 12 new outfits
but in the new year which i think is so
awesome I think this subscription site
is more for people who are going to work
out you know you're dedicated to it
because if you're not dedicated to it
you're not gonna be interested in the
subscription and you're not gonna be
interested in paying the $50 for the
outfit so I'm gonna show you what I got
and I like this month I think it was
really nice it was plain but the quality
of these is really amazing like it's
unlike any other outfit I've ever
purchased before and they compare
themselves to Lululemon's which are
Lululemon I don't know what she calls
herself or what the store calls itself
this was the first top and it's just a
spaghetti strap top that goes in like a
little Y and it just looks like this
just a little top and I do like this but
it's super super tight now when I
workout I don't like shirts to be like
skin tight I just don't like that and
this isn't a medium so I'm gonna go on
my account on the website and go up to a
large because I just I don't like super
skin tight things when I'm working out
it makes me feel uncomfortable like
shirt wise pants I don't care but shirts
don't like them to be super super tight
but I do like this it's really great
quality and it's great to wear it'll be
awesome during the summertime whenever
it's really hot so I do like this and
like I said it's great quality I mean
the fabric is just insane I really can't
like to see what they said next month
because I just I'm loving this so far
now these are the pants taste it and I
know they probably don't look like
anything special but I love these and I
mean they're so amazing they are skin
tight and they go they are long pants as
well I feel like you could do anything
in these pants like they don't hold you
back from a certain workout or anything
they're nice and tight so like sometimes
sweatpants can get in the way when
you're running or something and since
these are really tight it's just easy
and I don't know if you work out you
know what I'm talking about but I love
these they make my butt look really good
too
okay and this other side I want to talk
to you guys about is something that I
found out actually through Gregory
gorgeous this video and he put it in a
favorites video I think a while back he
was talking about this survey site and
it's called Opinion Outpost and
basically what you do is you sign up and
you take surveys and you can get free
stuff and basically you get points for
the things that you take surveys on and
you could cash them in for rewards or
whatever and then they'll sometimes send
you out free products and this side you
can actually see new products before
they come to the public before they're
out in the public and all that other
stuff so basically you're taking the
surveys to like get money and products I
think that's awesome and it's just free
to sign up so I mean it's super easy and
I do giveaways and stuff like a ten
thousand dollar giveaway every three
months which is really cool I mean this
is a free site so it's not like you know
you're paying to have to take your
survey and then you're getting paid back
it's not like that you're earning points
and then you could trade them in for
things and you can also train them in
for charities like if you're into
charities and stuff and there's a
certain one you like you could trade in
your points to help support you at the
charity so if you're interested I'll
leave that down below because I thought
it was different and if you didn't know
about it now you do I didn't know about
it I saw his video and I thought it was
really cool so I want to let my
subscribers know just in case you missed
out on it so I will leave that link
below I hope you guys enjoy this haul I
have a makeup tutorial coming up next
and I will have a bunch more videos
coming for you guys also I am trying to
do as many as I can on the weekends so I
can post them up during the week when
I'm at work but thank you guys so much
for watching I will see you guys in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
