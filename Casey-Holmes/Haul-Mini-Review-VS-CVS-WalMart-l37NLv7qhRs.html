really quickly just wanna let you know
that from now on in my videos I will be
putting when I'm wearing down below um
my what's on my nails what I like stuff
like that down below because I get a lot
of questions about it so I will be doing
that first place I'm going to show you
is CBS and these are just a few things I
got from there if you can tell by my
nails I have these like new little nails
or whatever these are just the impressed
nails and they come in a little box like
this and these are the Color Me one so
you can like paint them whatever color
you prefer they come in a little a cute
package like this and they look like
this when you first get them so they're
like kind of a clear white color it kind
of look like mine but you can tell I
paint in mine and of course you can just
peel off that little tab and stick them
onto your nail they're super easy to
deal with what I love is that I have all
of them and I've replaced my middle
finger one and you still have extras so
if one falls off you could totally put
it back on and then paint that whatever
you want so I've been using this I've
been loving them and then I picked up
this Milani nail lacquer and paradise
pink which is just like a really really
really super ultra light almost white
baby pink so that's why I painted these
if you want to see a review on these
nail polishes I will put the link down
below I do have a review on them I also
don't have a topcoat on these and you
can see how like shiny they are the next
thing I got for my nails I don't know if
I'm really gonna like these yet we'll
have to see there's a kiss nail dress
fashion that sticks the ultimate nail
fashion for tips and toes 28 jewels and
these are supposed to last up to 10 days
and I don't know if I said this but
these are so slapped up to 7 days but it
might have been going pretty strong so
we'll see but these are the kiss ones so
they're like a leopard print I don't
know if I'm gonna really wear these
because I don't I don't know if they'll
go with like my outfits like I love
these nails they work really well and
they just look so cute and professional
and they don't chip so that's really
nice but I have to try these out see if
I like them but I'll definitely be
purchasing another like impressed stuff
before I try these out but we'll just
say the next
that was a CVS instant polish remover
and gentle formula conditions and
moisturizes for natural nails baklava
eight fluid ounces this is the one that
has like the little sponge in it with a
solution and stuff I really like it took
my nail polish off like that it was just
really great and super convenient since
I had to travel back and forth sometimes
I don't have my nail kit always with me
just the last thing for CVS is um the
skin effects glycolic I'm gonna butcher
this because I really don't know how to
say it the glycolic or glycolic creme
cleanser this is five fluid ounces now
in one of my videos I told you guys to
leave me your favorite skincare stuff
down below now I think you guys were
talking about this when you're saying a
G name and Walgreens or CVS I don't know
I was at the store and I couldn't you
know and get all how YouTube they look
through the comments to see if you guys
are talking about so I just picked this
up cuz it sounded right I mean I don't
know I guess but if this is what you're
talking about me know I'm excited to try
it out it seems like it's been working
pretty decent I used it last night in
this morning and my skin looks you know
pretty good I will be doing a skincare
routine very soon I did film one but
then after I filmed it I'd like
completely broke out so I didn't want to
put that up because it's just kind of
like pointless I don't know I will be
putting all the prices down below by the
way because I do have their seats for
that I went to Walmart and I picked up
another couple things this was before
I'm at CVS because I wanted to pick this
up before I picked up anything else but
my fiance really wanted to go to Walmart
so I picked up the Neutrogena rapid
clear I don't know if you can return
stuff like faced up to Walmart so I
guess I'm just gonna keep this I picked
up this rapid clearing treatment pads
these stain my face like really bad I
don't know how I like these yet because
they sting worse than the ash drink
that's like ash drink you know it's just
like a little sting every now and then
but these like stain my face and then I
also got this which I've been using
pretty much every day since I got it for
like so it slipped two days or whatever
the Neutrogena rabbit clear acne defense
face lotion it's all free daily lotion
visibly reduces breakouts blah blah blah
they pick that up and I will put these
prices down below as well um and I also
picked up the almond
oil-free makeup white I love these I
swear by them I think they're amazing if
you watched my last video you know that
I got the warm palette from Coastal
Scents and sad news for you guys who
wanted like a review and a tutorial I'm
actually returning this because the
color payoff is horrible I mean it's
just not there I tried a day after I
filmed that video I was like okay I'm so
excited I'm gonna like use these colors
on my eyes today and I went to put my
brush in them and put them on my eyes
and literally like it wouldn't even
appear it was just the color payoff is
not there it's really sad because I was
looking forward to this and it just
didn't work out and I am gonna be
returning it I can't really expect much
from a palette that I only paid like $15
for but you know I heard a lot of people
talk about this rave about it whatever
and it just didn't work out then I went
to Victoria's Secret this is the last
place and I did buy a new bra which I'm
wearing right now and I'm not gonna show
you guys and I've got this crop top I
did not know there were two for 26 if I
did I would have picked up another one
but of course the lady like didn't tell
me cuz he's alone or 1750 so I was kind
of ticked off when I got home and she
did not tell me that things were even -
426 but um this is just what looks like
so it's a really nice huge neck so it's
gonna hang off really nicely and then
you just have the longer in the back
shorter in the front crop it's really
cute on and the bra that I got I'm just
gonna say it's like a hot pink and I
figured it'd be really cute to just kind
of hang this off and have like a hot
pink strap if you don't like bra straps
repelling I think I'm crazy it's like
the only time I'll wear a bra strap with
like a crop shirt so it will just be so
bright and vibrant and I love it so I
picked this up it's super soft I
definitely recommend them and this is
also in a small so yeah I bet it's
pretty much all I've got I wasn't in a
wait until I got my lorac powder from
Outlook or otlet hot look but look I
think it's a good look I don't know but
I just added not to because I just
really wanted to get this up and one
another video up for you guys and the
day that I'm off which is Thursday I
wanted to do like my hair video like how
I style it everyday pretty much what I
do
today last night I went to bail my hair
wet I woke up this morning it was super
like wavy and frizzy and I just took a
one-inch Conair curling iron to it
wrapped it around and it was this is
what I got also one more thing I wanted
to show you guys this cuz you're
probably gonna ask where do your tank
top I got this from what sale right
after I got engaged I went on their
website and um I saw this tank tates on
yours with like a little diamond on it I
thought it was so cute and its really
baggy just great for summer but I
basically got because I just got engaged
and I was like oh how sweet
and it was like five bucks so but I hope
you guys enjoyed this haul and I will
see you all in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
