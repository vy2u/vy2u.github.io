a haul I've gotten quite a bit of stuff
this past week so I thought it was true
you guys if you're interested in seeing
all the stuff that I've purchased then
just keep watching ok so the first thing
I purchased were these Sedona lace
brushes and these were 69.95 this is
what it looks like I really really
really love these brushes I'm so happy I
decided to purchase them and invest in
them and they're super soft very just I
don't know it's amazing what great
quality brushes will do to your makeup
like how much better your application
will be how much easier it is to like
blend out colors and stuff like that so
I love these and I highly recommend them
also with my purchase from Sedona lace
they were having a promo going on you
get a free gift with purchase
so my free gift with purchased which was
I think everybody's was this little pink
shadow then you got a little blue then
also you got this little brown kind of
burgundy color which this one's my
favorite of course because we all know I
love my neutrals and you also got a
travel size eb 13 which you do get the
full size in the little vortex
collection so that's always nice you can
never have too many brushes next we went
to Walgreens I've gotten I got a few
miscellaneous stuff there but I think I
got this Tuesday too so they had like
dollar went wild polishes so if you're
interested I think they might still have
it going on but I did get this one here
this is called I need a refreshment and
I've never tried a simple colors nail
polish so I decided to try it since I've
heard so many things about it and this
is in a dream on very very pretty color
um if you follow me on Twitter or you've
kind of been following me since day one
you know that I am a CVS junkie I love
CVS I go all the time using extra bucks
and stuff like that I just absolutely
love them I went to go get just face
wipes and I ended up spending like $43
which was absolutely ridiculous but it
happened so I did
just my face light switch these are the
all May oil-free makeup remover talents
I love those repurchase them so many
times and I got this lumi I've never
used this brand before so a looming
Finland matte touch deep cleansing peat
mask oil absorbing pore tightening for
normal to oily skin so I did pick that
up I'm excited to try it out and see
what I think of it then they had this
Cetaphil stuff going on it was buy one
get one half off I have tried these I
got these Thursday and I just I've been
you know trying them out seeing how I
like them and I actually really really
love them so the first thing I got was
the most expensive this was $17.99 it's
the Cetaphil derma control oil control
moisturizer and formulated for acne
prone skin and of course if you have
oily skin this is great as well I opened
this box because I get a little nosey
when I go shopping and I had a $2.00 off
coupons gift gift pon a two dollar off
coupon so of course I snag that thing
out and used it on this purchase because
that's $17.99 it's a lot of money
personally I think that's expensive for
a drugstore moisturizer if I'm going to
Sephora purchasing moisturizer I kind of
know I'm going to be spending some money
but going to the drugstore I don't
usually think I'm going to spend more
than like eight bucks but whatever it's
definitely worth it so this is what the
bottle looks like it is so nice I highly
recommend this I actually use probably
about a dime-size amount on my face and
it doesn't make me shiny greasy anything
like that
I am so liking this so far and I hope
this you know just keeps working for me
because this is probably the best
moisturizer I've found so far for my
Olie skin especially at the drugstore so
then for a half off I got this set of
fill all patrol foam wash and that's
just what that looks like I don't know
I'm not a huge fan of the foam but it's
been working pretty well for me so I did
pick that up next I don't know if there
is a shoe show everywhere I haven't
really heard of anybody talking about a
shoe show around them but we have one
kind of close to a town where I live so
that's where I went bought these shoes
they
I buy one get one half off so I bought
these flip-flops I thought they're
really cute or these sandals whatever I
really really like them I thought they
were different and with those half off I
got some black patents flats that I used
for work which are like somewhere that
way because I use them for work like
every day and then I also bought two of
the same pairs of sandals just in
different colors these are 1699 so of
course I bought one and got one half off
so I purchased one in white and in black
so yeah you can never have too many
sandals I feel like okay next I order
from the site called $10 muncom now I
first saw this site like when I was
watching YouTube videos and stuff in
like scrolling around in YouTube they
had like this advertisement for them and
I decided to go check it out so I
ordered a couple things and I am so
impressed I will definitely be
repurchasing more stuff from them but
the first thing I got I just got a
couple because like I said I wanted to
try the side out and see if I liked it
but this is the first thing I got it's
kind of like a smock dress and it just
goes down like that it's like a tan
color and I really wanted to try this
monk dress out because if you own a
smock dress or you've kind of tried them
on if you're bigger chested smart
dresses that are about this long do
nothing for you like they don't like
cover your boobs all like I'm very anal
about stuff like that like it has to
cover my boobs and go like underneath
and flare out because if it just stops
like right here like if a little seam
stops right here it's gonna make you
look bigger and it's just not attractive
so I was excited to see that this small
part was pretty long because this
actually has about right here at my
ribcage which is awesome and yeah it's
just really nice the fabric is super
soft really thick and durable you can't
see through it so I love this and for
only $10 it's amazing by the way this
company does not know who I am they have
not sent me anything I did purchase
these myself and both of these are $10
everything on the site is $10 or less
and then I got this top which I got it
in a medium and it's a little big but
that's okay
I think it'll shrink in the wash but I
saw the small on the model which I also
love to tell you the model size which i
think is so helpful but I got into
medium you have like this stud detailing
on the sleeves and then it also goes all
the way down the shirt and a tee and you
have like a little cute little charm
right there it also goes all the way
around the back and of course it has the
detailing right there goes down it kind
of just has like this faded detail on
the back which I actually like so it's
kind of grungy but so freakin cute I
love it and again this is really really
nice quality super thick and dirt well
not thick but it's nice and durable so I
highly recommend it
and this actually came with is some kind
of tag and it's from the treasure rock
design in Los Angeles don't know who
that is but I love this shirt so take
that up okay now we're going to talk
about t.j.maxx I got some stuff from
there first thing I got were these
shorts I absolutely love shorts like
this kind of like the grunge dirty ish
kind of destroyed look and I like it and
this is what they look like I got them
in a size 5 and this is the but I love
it when t.j.maxx has like the original
price tag with their tag because you can
just see the deal that you're getting
and this is from the brand first kissed
for our first kiss I don't know they're
originally $34 and I got them for $12.99
still okay next this shirt some of you
guys probably gonna be like uh okay and
I only spent 750 on this shirt and I
love skulls if you watch my previous
haul I talked about how I love the
skulls and like the rock to roll stuff
so we're not exactly like rock and roll
but I don't know I like the skulls and
like affliction and stuff like that but
anyways this is the shirt I absolutely
fell in love with this shirt the detail
is so awesome has like little studs on
it and like little crystal thingies I
forget liek all those but I thought this
was so neat and different I just had to
have it and it was only 750 I don't know
how long these are gonna stay on but I
mean I would least get one good we're at
it
we're out of it so I really like this
shirt a lot it's like one of my
favorites I'm so excited about it then I
got this shirt for only eight dollars I
thought it was really cute when I tried
it on like a light blue turquoise and it
goes down it cinches in at the bottom
and it's just I don't know it's really
cute and very flattering I got this in a
size small yeah that's just that shirt
cute not only eight dollars so you know
whatever um next I have like this little
cardigan thing now I took the tags off
because I was gonna wear it for work or
to work one of the day by N and I'm not
wearing it I paid $20 for it which to me
was like ridiculous I didn't think it
was worth the $20 I don't know I feel
like it's just you know a little
cardigan like a little shawl and they
wanted $20 for it oh no but I looked at
the original price tag and it was $58
and I was like if somebody's gonna pay
$58 for this then you are crazy I would
never pay $50 for something like this
just like a little over shirt but it's
really cute you know whatever it just
goes cute over tank tops and stuff so I
can wear it to work all right okay the
next thing is something I was pretty
impressed by I saw this tank top in the
clearance section this was only $10 and
I was like oh my gosh I love army green
I really do I'm like obsessed with army
green so I had to get this tank and what
really drew me to it was I could tell
like just by looking at it the fabric
wasn't just like any other tank top it
was really great quality it's a thick
tank top like something can wear just by
itself and I got it home and I was just
looking at more and I was like okay
that's why I love it so much it's from
Express so Express like has the best
tank tops ever I'm absolutely in love
with this I just you know had to have it
especially only ten dollars I also
bought like this little white tank top
it's just a nice little plain one no big
deal was like five bucks
I feel like you can never have too many
basics I also got this shirt which I was
really surprised it was on sale for $10
because I really liked it it's just a
nice kind of lightweight gray like
heather gray top and it has little
buttons they don't come undone but at
the bottom it just has like a knot and
it is so cute it just sits on your body
so well I'm absolutely in love with it
and I'm pretty sure this was in Excise
small so how cute is that and it's only
$10 so that was great
next I got these adorable shorts I have
tried a bunch of stuff from this brand
it's called indigo rant rain I guess I
know that's what the brand looks like
I've tried a bunch of different shorts
and pants and stuff from this brand
um at t.j.maxx and I'm gonna look them
up because I'm just gonna start buying
stuff from the store if they have any or
anything anywhere that sells it I'm just
gonna start buying them because I'm
absolutely in love with it it's so soft
so durable they fit me so well
um I got this in a size 5 and of course
these are just some like really cute
blue shorts so it looks like and these
are only $12.99 I really like these I
think they're so cute and just like a
great little pop of color I don't know I
don't have anything like this so this
was the last clothing item I got and I
really really love it I'll be doing an
outfit of the day soon with this I don't
really have anything like sailor theme I
guess you could say but I really love
this it was only $12.99 and I got it in
a size small it's one of those like
loose really thin shirts but it's so
adorable so this is what it looks like
it's high it's longer in the front and
the back and shorter on the sides and
then you have just this crisscross
detailing on the back just super
lightweight great for the spring and
summer on the really hot months and I
really love it so I will be doing it
outfit of the day soon with this it's
just so freaking cute okay so I got two
pairs
shoes and one hair product the first
pair of shoes were these I thought they
were just adorable and its really cute
kind of like the Bert red stuff I didn't
even know these are from American Eagle
tell us heart until I checked out and I
was like oh look American Eagle I don't
know why they put a line through all the
names but there must be some reason for
that got him in at eight and these were
only $12.99 I really like these just
really cute basic flip-flops so pick
those up then I got these pair from
Steve Madden which like I said it can
you've never have enough sandals I have
a lot so I got these they're really cute
they kind of have like a beaded detail
right here these were only $14.99 and
they are originally 34 I don't know if
you guys can see that very well but I
really like these thought they were so
cute they're really well made they're
just nice sandals so I like that and
then I don't know where the cap went for
this but it's the catwalk root boost
spray for texture and lift this was like
three ninety-nine and I know catwalks
expensive so I really want to try this
out and especially anything that says
root boobs texturized volume powder
anything like that I'm gonna try so I
can't wait to see how this works with my
hair I don't really know how to use it
it says use it in towel dried hair so
I'm guessing you can blow dry and stuff
with this stuff yeah this is only four
dollars and it was great but that is my
haul I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and like this if you want to see more
hauls in the future because I think I'm
gonna have some more coming we're going

month so you know I'm gonna have to go
