drugstore haul but I also wanted to show
you guys really quickly cuz I just got
back when I got from TJ Maxx and the
first I Instagram these they almost on
the shades I love these they're like a
goldish kind of color and they are just
too cute
I love aviators like ones that fit my
nose these are by Franco's Sarto a bit
new but these are so sleek I'm like in
love so fallen and I got them for 13
bucks so that's pretty cool and then
this was like my bigger purchase and it
looks like this
I'm you guys so I'm getting a new laptop
and a new camera this is gonna be for my
laptop it's a nice cute laptop case from
Tyler bradden
and um just looks like that of course
the insides padded and black so I
thought it was just super cute I love it
so cute
then I just thought two pairs of jeans
jeans oh and I bought some air I don't
think you guys really care about those
deep umm but trying to make sure y'all
don't see all the clothes of that ground
but I bought this pair I'm pretty sure
they're black yeah they should be black
but they look like this just nice plain
black skinny jeans cuz I don't have any
they have nothing on the pockets or
anything and then I bought my first pair
of white pants and these are a white
skinny jeans I'm so excited the way
these in the spring and summer um it's
gonna be kind of hot in summer times
I've done here in Georgia so hopefully
in the spring and they're just really
nice white my name is Allah so or
jeggings whatever so I got those I know
I guess I'll get onto what the whole
point of the video supposed to be about
and it's gonna be my drugstore haul that
I did like this past week I bought quite
a quite a bit of stuff and I wanted to
show you guys because you were asking
about it and seeing what today like what
I thought about my product stuff got a
moment kind of right here for you ready
to go um so the first thing is I did a
tutorial on this and maybe you guys have
seen out enough this will be out before
that or after but it just looks like
this I bought this
from my team and this is a smoky bronze
created for brown eyes
I love this palette and wearing it right
now is amazing and I just oh I love it
it's like five dollars so and I got mine
at Walmart I didn't buy that that's
Drive so the next thing I got is is
Rimmel stay matte powder just looks like
this I got it in transparent I had to be
very careful with this because I'm more
on the tan side so it could like um look
white on my skin if I'm not careful and
I have to use a kabuki with it like I
can't use an elf powder brush because
it's too dense and I'll just like put
like white mark right here so I have to
be very careful with it worth with a
kabuki but you know just be aware um the
next thing is this web la blush that
I've heard nothing but great things
about and it's called Heather silk and
it just looks like that very pigmented
blush like insanely limited I want to be
very careful with this but it's really
really really pretty awesome for three
dollars the next one is something I
posted on Instagram and I raved about
especially on Twitter and it's this
brush and i got this from walmart it's
just an angled contour brush blush brush
whatever i really love it because you
can get in the hollows of your cheeks if
you went to contour and it's really nice
to just dust on some blush on your cheek
i I love this brush it was only nine
dollars at Walmart and I'm gonna go pick
another one up so I could have one for
contour on one for blush but I recommend
this so nice this is a product I used to
use that last not this past December but
the December before and it's the L'Oreal
mascara I don't know what's call think
it's like volume eyes or something like
that but it's the all-black tube it has
like collagen or something like that on
it got it in the black is black and it
just looks like that
I really love this but it has to dry a
little bit more before I can even wear
it because I like more of a dry mascara
than I do
um really wet one so this is gonna try a
little bit but this catch my breath
but this will definitely give you some
thick lashes so this is a really good
mascara if you've ever seen in the
drugstore the only thing that sucks is
you can't you don't know what kind of
mascara it is because it just says
lore'l on it like and the writing on the
bottom is way too tiny I can't even I'd
hit me like a microscope to look at that
thing so the next thing I got is this
rebel lash precision glue I love this
stuff this is a really great lash glue I
love the fact that it has a brush
applicator it's just really nice so I
recommend this if you were false lashes
this these next two things I bought
because um a lot of gurus recommended it
and this one in particular when I SML
used in her foundation routine and it
looked gorgeous on her so I thought I'd
try it out it's the maybelline superstay
makeup and honey beige and it looks
gorgeous on her but on me it doesn't
work I have very oily skin though and I
have to be very careful with what I use
that's why I don't ever use drugstore
foundations like right now I have my
NARS sheer matte on and that's like the
only thing I can really use to put up
with my oily skin so um this is good on
her and this was all right on me but I
feel like it has to be really cold for
me to wear this because that's what my
skin's like not so oily and it's not
even that cold anymore so um but this
does leave a nice full coverage finish
if you don't have as well as skin as me
um so I do recommend this it just it
didn't work for me so sorry the next
thing is something I really don't know
about but everybody literally everybody
raves about and it's the instant age
rewind eraser dark circle thing and I
got mine and honey I do believe did I
get my honey yes I did honey miel um I
think I just have to play with it more
because I don't really see what the hype
is about it um it does blend really
nicely but I don't know how I feel about
it
well just have to see so I did buy that
and I'm still trying it out to see if I
like it or not and yeah I did touch my
hair a lot in this video so far but boo
whatever now this is probably the most
disappointing purchase um and it's back
for sister's formulas the first thing I
bought from physicians there's a heart a
physician's formula that was actually
expensive evidence the bronze booster
in medium to dark and you open it up it
has a little mirror and you have your
little pad right here and then you can
see how like little bronzing balls I
guess um I don't like this it says
medium to dark it does not show up on my
skin at all like there's not even a
sheer coverage like it's just not there
at all so I'm very disappointed with
this I spent a lot of money on it at $14
very very disappointed um that just
sucks so I don't recommend this at all
and if you've been watching me or
watching my youtube videos follow me on
Twitter you probably know that the SMS
MF MSF has been gonna be MSF yeah but
only skinfinish natural um by mac has
been breaking me out so I just been
breaking out with that and then I was
using clean and clear that was like the
worst that was not helping at all it was
actually making things a lot worse than
it needed to be so I no longer use clean
and clear I absolutely hate that brand I
was wondering why I never used it and I
remembered why I absolutely hate that
brand if you love it and it works for
you that's good but personally for me it
does not work at all and I hate it so um
that was breaking me up bag too so those
two together were just like horrible it
was sad but um so I went back to what I
used to use and I've been loving em and
I love these all my whites I've used
these for a very long time and for some
reason I didn't buy them last time
I think it's cuz they were too pricey at
the moment but um again I'm back to
these and I love them they're so great
neither oil freak and then I went back
to the garden experts foliate or daily
exfoliating gel
I love Garnier products I've loved by
the smell and I love the fact that oil
free and this is not a harsh exfoliator
either it's actually really nice on your
skin personally I love this and it
doesn't break me out so these two have
been a blessing thank God because they
have actually saved my skin my skin is
still kind of recovering but um they
don't break out as bad as they work so
it was getting bad there for a minute so
I just cut out the MSF and the clean and
clear and I have been fine ever since
oh yeah that's pretty much my drugstore
ha if you have any information or any
information if you have any questions on
any of these products I will be happy to
let you know I will definitely post them
all in a down bar try to include prices
I don't know yet
because I'd have to go look them up and
stuff but I might include prices I don't
know yet
we'll see but I hope you guys enjoy this
video and I will see you on the next one
