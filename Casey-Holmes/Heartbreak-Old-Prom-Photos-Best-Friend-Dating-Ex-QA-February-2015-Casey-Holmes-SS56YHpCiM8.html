thought was just so amazing and you know
he did so much for me and then you're
feeling because I'll miss her cries huh
and that we would kind of butt heads a
little bit which is completely true
obviously I'm not talking that person
anymore
I really feel for these girls and things
I've read have been so OnPoint trying to
tell myself go to the vodka route if
your boyfriend or whoever does not
defend you let him go to lip all of them

you guys for the Q&amp;amp;A so I want to keep
them going at least once a month they're
just fun to sit down and talk to you

Q&amp;amp;A question you can always leave it in

Taylor Nicole egg said before you find
out who Gossip Girl was who did you
think it was let me tell you I had no
idea if you have not watched Gossip Girl
and you don't know who Gossip Girl is in
the series quit watching right now or
fast forward because I'm about to spoil
it for you
I had no idea that Dan was Gossip Girl
my mind was blown I was like you have
got to be kidding me why is it Dan
Humphrey really
Humphrey but I thought it was either I
knew it wasn't Blair I honestly thought
it was like some random chick that just
got a bunch of stuff about people and
talk put it on the Internet I had no
idea it was one of them so Dan played it
off really good but when you go and
watch the season's over and over again
you kind of get the hint that Dan is
Gossip Girl but you have to really pay
attention
and I didn't pay that much attention so
I was blown away I cannot pronounce your
Instagram name but you said Mean Girls
are clueless definitely Mean Girls all
the way that was just my favorite movie
ever I love love love Mean Girls
oh those cupcakes asked if you were a
cupcake flavor what would you be and why
I love chocolate anything I'm just a
chocoholic so I would definitely be a
chocolate cupcake with not a lot of
icing because I don't like that much
icing I actually had a sprinkles cupcake
not too long ago I was so excited I was
like oh my gosh we have one in Linux
which it's been there for a while now
but oh like oh my gosh we've got one
I've heard nothing but great things
about this place and the cupcakes are
good but the icing was like it was
mainly icing and barely any of the cake
I think you know what I mean
and I do not like a lot of icing so I
would be a chocolate cupcake which is a
little bit of chocolate icing I mean
just just the top of it I don't need
five inches of icing Jasmin and five
said when she shows a prompt pic of you
from high school all in which one prom
and it wasn't even my prom like I've
never went to my high school's prom but
the problem I went to was a friend of
Mines in his high school and I just
didn't like prom I don't know I was like
I'm spending all this damn money to go
here for an hour - and then I'm leaving
I'll show you picture I'm Draya wrote
and asked are you a morning person no I
do like when I wake up in the morning
zone and actually get up and get stuff
done I like it I really do like I don't
like sleep until twelve this Celso EXO
said to drinks you always get from
Starbucks and this one is so easy I
either get a green tea with no sweetener
and both of these I get usually venti
but I always get the green tea venti
because I like suck that drink down I
love it so much so an iced green tea
with no sweetener and then I also get
skinny iced caramel macchiatos jsk inss
pizza or hamburgers pizza all the way I
actually ordered a wall Fox jumper for
Valentine's Day and it has a big slice
of pizza with pepperoni hearts and it
says my date or something like that
get something to do with Valentine's Day
and pizza and I was like yes because I
had somebody send it to me on Twitter
and I was like I'm going to buy that
right now and I did and I loved it so
Pizza all the way it's so good
Emmy Lou who asked trendy wish would
come back honestly you guys I'm like I
know I wear ripped jeans a lot but I
loved like the distressed intense ripped
jeans like I just love them they can
look so sexy if you pair them right and
I just feel like people don't really
wear ripped jeans anymore I don't know
is it them I'm just I don't see it as
much as I used to I used to love ripped
denim like sliced open crazy smiles
Stephanie asks definitely favorite
liquor or mixed drink so for just liquor
I would say Malibu rum just the regular
like coconut flavor or whatever
I made it drink it one of my videos
where it's Malibu rum sprite zero and a
little bit of Crystal Light mix it all
together it is so good you guys mixed
drinks by far I am a total margarita fan
but I've been trying to cut myself to
wean off of them because I really don't
need that many more graves anymore um so
I'm going to sex on the beach or
screwdrivers and I don't like vodka I
don't but I'm trying to tell myself go
to the vodka route just go that way
because me and tequila we need a break
from each other because I love tequila
favorite song of the moment oh my god so
this one is so easy by the way if my
favorites video isn't up be prepared for
a lot of songs this month because I did
do a December favorites with songs oh my
gosh you guys are gonna be blown away
and I have so many so this is definitely
my favorite song of a moment I just
think it's so fun it's definitely again
for the grown and sexy you know I just
say that because I feel like certain
songs just aren't appropriate even
though I know like the whole generation
like the newest generation you know they
don't care they already know probably
with sexes and everything but I'm just
saying I don't want to promote a song
that sexual to my younger subscribers
because I would feel really bad and I
would feel like a horrible friend this
is for the grown and sexy but I mean
don't be offended by it because some
people gotta fit in I was like oh please
come on
song is so I just love the beat like I
love everything about it and if I want
to get hyped up this is my song so not
this one it's called do it by my co
Montana but I love this shoe or bags
definitely shoes shoes all the way I
love me some shoes I used to not even
like killed I think about a year ago I
never wore heels at all and then all of
a sudden this year I just kind of like
grew and like it felt really comfortable
in my own skin and really felt
comfortable like getting really dressed
up and going out so shoes are definitely
a big part of my life like I love
pairing different shoes I love buying
different shoes just I don't know it
makes an outfit so shoes all the way eat
Goldie 10 said who would you say is your
double ganger
I say a young Britney what would your
less what would be your last meal and
what are your Holy Grail makeup products
xoxo Gossip Girl
ha ha ha that's cute um double ganger
which basically means like a twin um I
would say Britney the thing about me and
Britney Spears the reason why I feel
like I got this so much or I still get
it it's just our eye shape and we have
really dark brown eyes so our shapes are
kind of more Jupe as well and the deep
brown eyes it's pretty similar so
definitely I would say her to my last
meal would definitely have to be pizza
yeah pizza because I love pizza and then
what am i holy ground makeup products I
have a few honestly um the one the one
Holy Grail makeup off the top of my head
is as they wanted to wear foundation
that's one not just like I know I love
and will forever use RMB 2014 asked do
you believe in your horoscope if do you
believe in your horoscope if it says
you and someone else aren't compatible
if that makes any sense
PS girl I believe it is the truth boo
boo um I read I read into my horoscope
and I love horoscope honestly I'm a
Sagittarius and I believe I'm
Sagittarius for sure like everything
that you're supposed to be when your
secretaries is what I am things I've
read have been so on point - I read this
one a horse goat because I was talking
to somebody and I wanted to read what
our horoscopes were if our horoscopes
were compatible and it kind of said we
were but it kind of said that we would
kind of butt heads a little bit um which
is completely true does obviously I'm
not talking that person anymore uh but I
I don't know I believe I don't know I
wouldn't like break up with somebody if
my you know horoscope said that they
weren't a good match for me I'll just be
like oh Lord we're gonna see what's
gonna happen but I think it's fun to
read and it's kind of something to
always keep in the back of your mind and
be like oh crap
the horoscope was right that time or it
could be wrong you know you never know
horoscopes can be wrong candid beauty
asked when you have bad days what do you
do to lift yourself up I love music like
I can go in my car and just drive around
this thing music I could be a home
listening to music music will always
make me feel better and I listen to like
music like that like something that's
gonna be dancin hi-def you know ready to
go um so I just listened to music
Elena Shaw asked have you ever been
bullied um never like in school I was
never really played much at all I mean
people say rude things that's just cause
people are assholes
but bullied I would say I would say I
was bullied by some girls that I used to
know because of my ex because um they
were very catty and very just you know
didn't care about me my feelings and
they want to make sure you know I was
hurt and stuff like that so I would
definitely say yes and let me tell you
some
if you're hanging around somebody that
does that do not let them walk over you
like these girls weren't my friends they
were his friends and you know when
you're with somebody you just want to
get along with their friends everybody
can be happy go-lucky such as too many
bows and there's some drama
well I'm Jason if your boyfriend or
whoever does not defend you when
somebody be rude to you're being really
catty
let him go to lip all of them go there
other people out there that will defend
you and definitely more guys that will
not let their friends talk to you like
you're trash that's my tip for the day
make me flawless calm said well you got
via eyelets in my sea Sunday and also
were you a mean girl in high school love
that movie I don't think I was a mean
girl in high school I kind of I'm very
honest there's a difference between
constructive criticism and being honest
and then there's a difference between
being rude and just plain out mean I was
never rude clean up mean I was just
honest and very blunt you know what I'm
saying and I don't know from the VIII
minutes I will be at all the beauty cons
this year though y'all I'm going to
Dallas actually in March so if you're
going to those Beauty cons in those
areas I would be there but I max I don't
know about yet I don't know if I'm gonna
go to I'm s
keeping up with meat or Emmy et tes what
would your advice be to someone who is
trying to move on from a friendship that
ended badly like she was my best friend
and I feel lost without her oh sorry I
know how you feel
trust me I know how you feel I really
it's just kind of going back to that's
so hard that's it's a hard situation um
just try to get your mind off of it if
anything if it ended over something
silly just apologize and be friends with
them again me and Trina for instance we
have had our falling-out I'm just the
type of person where if you pissed me
off or if you hurt my feelings or
something like that I will cut you off
it's a very bad I would say it's a very
bad trait to have because I can hold
grudges like a boss I will hold them
forever um but like when me and her had
our falling-out you know the last differ
you months but then it was like you know
you when you grow up you learn that the
grudges and stuff are not what's
important in life
it's that friendship and that bond
especially that you can build and like
we never me and Trina never knew that we
would ever be as close as we are because
we're pretty close I mean we were like
hanging out non-stop for like four
months non-stop but if it ended over
something really stupid you know just
try to be friends with her and be the
bigger person and say you know I'm sorry
I think it's stupid I want us to be
friends again and if she just doesn't
want to be friends and you don't deserve
something like that in your life so just
keep moving forward keep yourself busy
if you know things don't work out with
that talk like I said if I ended over
something really petty life is too short
this is such a good question I'm Emily
Nicole asks which bring it on movie is
your favorite definitely the first one I
feel like the first movies like a like
series that people create are the best
and the first bring it on is amazing
like awesome Oh Ernest Hall asked what
do you do to get rid of hair on your
face I actually I don't know if you guys
can see when I take pictures with my HD
um camera you can really see the buzz I
have right here I do have quite a bit of
hair right here like peach fuzz and it's
a little bit longer I'll leave it I
don't get any wax on my face just a
little too harsh for me and like for my
brows if I want to remove some hair I'll
use this little Remington shaver thingy
and I'll just kind of go around and like
shake them back out but that's about all
I use if I'm going to remove like some
hair on my face
Anna grace asked what would you say
about your best friend dating your ex
well she wouldn't be my best friend
and I hate situations like that like
those kinds of situations just show you
how real people are and how bad some
people can be they're both that dirty to
get together let them go be dirty let
them go do their thing because you know
what

guys Karen xxs wish to you prefer
Bellamy or foxy logs trying to decide
which one to spend my money on and as
you guys know I was with Bellamy for a
really long time I've actually this has
been the year that I have decided to
branch off and stop working with
different companies I'm not saying that
to bash anybody but it's just a dick
it's just the year to kind of step out
and experiment with different things and
so I decided to start working with foxy
laughs after using their hair and I'm
not kidding you guys it's not just
because I work with foxy locks like
their hair is
amazing I'm wearing it non-stop and how
much hair you get is in saying I use a
240 gram I think it's 24-inch extensions
in the darkest Brown I don't have them
in right now but but I love them and
they don't get dry when you curl them or
anything like that they look so
beautiful they're so soft if you're
going to spend your money I say go foxy
locks and that's I was a felony for a
really long time so I know their hair
and I know their hair really well I've
purchased my own extensions from Bellamy
and I've purchased my own extensions
from foxy locks and for the - I would
say foxy locks okay Mel but Mel the
toast
ask in your videos you often look over
to your right if someone over there
watching you or are you doing a self
check in a nearby mirror absolutely love
your videos and personality well thank
you so much I have a bigger TV screen
right here so sometimes I get distracted
in online that hair that hair is just
not looking cute you know like I just
see everything right here and having the
TV as my view finder is just so much
more convenient especially in tutorials
basically my viewfinder over here so so
I got keep looking over here all the
time sometimes I just have issues haha
just lovely one two three one said you
seem so perfect give up some dirt do you
drink out of the milk jug leave leave
the clothes on the bathroom floor have a
messy car leave all the dishes all over
oh yeah I'm not perfect I'm far from
perfect my clothes are always on the
floor I've had tons of laundry that I
have not been washed in forever like
well they've been washed but they still
pile up like I can never get my laundry
taken care of it's just not gonna happen
I've kind of come to that assumption and
have realized that I'm just not going to
get my life together when it comes to
laundry my house is never perfectly
clean I'm not gonna lie it's not
perfectly clean something spotless all
the time I have three dogs who love to
tear up everything that I own especially
if I really love it they tear it up I
actually bought um a Tory Burch bracelet
as a present and guess who decided to
chew that up
where's yeah she's over there too I
brush bracelet dunzo Allison Marie asked
do you ever think about being a
therapist or mindful
motivational speaker for women if
YouTube doesn't work out in the future
because going to give some bomb-ass
advice thank you I like to think I give
pretty decent advice I can't take it all
the time but I try to give it as good as
possible I definitely use YouTube as my
outlet for advice because I feel like a
lot of young girls need it nowadays I
mean it's hot it's a hard life
especially for younger teenage girls
nowadays I feel like the bullying and I
mean like the cyberbullying and all that
stuff is just so intense and I like I
mean we had bullying in my school but it
was never like so intense and social
media wasn't that popular when I was in
school until like the end um I really
feel for these girls and I feel for the
girls that think they have to have
something perfect like a perfect
relationship at 14 and get married you
know I would even love to have honestly
my own book to be quite honest with you
I would love to have my own book of just
different topics and different things
that have gone on in my life and then
I've learned and that I could give
advice on um so we'll just we'll see
what the future holds okay my camera is
about to die I've gone through three
batteries because I've been filming so
much lately this last question I'm gonna
answer is from Claire 98 et toi in she
said how do you know when it's or when
it's right with a guy and how can you
not ever think it love you love you
honey um oh let me tell you guys I don't
know I am NOT a boy expert I will tell
you that right now I have no idea I
honestly don't know like when it comes
to guys I think you just kind of have to
go with the flow and just go for it
you're gonna get hurt you're gonna get
happy you're gonna be sad I mean you you
never know unless you try and I always
say go for it the last person I talked
to I thought was just so amazing and you
know he did so much for me he was so
sweet and then that's what happened so
um and you know what it sucked it sucked
really bad and I kind of I I really
don't like him for it for what happened
or ever but it's all hard
of talking dating and just figuring
people out or even just being friends
with guys so it's just all part of the
process which really sucks but go for it
you never know to try I say you go girl
and don't ever think it just just go
with the flow just let it happen and
usually that's when the best stuff
happens is when you just let go and let
God and just enjoy your time just be
yourself
have fun don't even worry don't worry
about anything because if he's gonna
mess up or if it's just not gonna work
out it's gonna happen hope you guys
