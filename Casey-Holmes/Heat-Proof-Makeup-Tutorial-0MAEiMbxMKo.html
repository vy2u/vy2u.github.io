kind of a heatproof makeup look this is
basically the makeup I go to and I'm
know I'm going to be running errands
maybe going shopping and I still want to
wear our foundation concealer and stuff
like that but I really wanted to last
all day and have found a lot of nice
long wearing products that keep me shine
free that stay on forever and I just
love these products and I really
recommend them so yes and also I know
you guys can probably tell a new set up
I did get a new mirror and I had got a
new table I showed it in my blog channel
so if you're not subscribed go subscribe
to my blog channel but um my mirror was
too big for my mouth door or my mouth
desk and I ended up just switching it
onto this playing table on half and I
liked it so far and now all my makeup is
in these Alex 9 drawers and so far and
loving it and I've kind of changed my
lining up and everything like that so
let me know what you think of the set up
down below in the comments and yes don't
forget to like the video and let me know
what some of your favorite heatproof
makeup products are down below and I
will see you guys in my next video
ah okay so I'm gonna start off this
tutorial right with some of my favorite
music and my favorite song popped on
Pandora so I was happy I'm gonna go
ahead and take the philosophy total
madness and I'm going to put this mainly
in my t-zone this really helps control
the oil on my skin and it does reduce
the size of my pores then I'm gonna take
the Yves pearl anti Strine mattifying
gel this is a great primer for oily skin
girls and I'm just going to Pat this
again all over my teeth on just to make
sure I stay nice and matte throughout
the day
so now I'm going to take my makeup
forever mat Bell applies to my beauty
blender I love this foundation for the
summertime it's amazing and it really
keeps my oils under control and it does
not feel heavy at all on my skin and it
gives great coverage so this is
definitely my favorite high-end
foundation and then I'm going to go
ahead and take my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre and I'm just going to go ahead and
prime my eyes in a sense you always knew
if you're looking for a long wear
concealer that will not crease at all
during the heat in the summertime this
is definitely the one to try I
absolutely love the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer it lasts so long and it's
hands-down the best concealer I have
used to this day and I just can't get
enough of it so I just go ahead and I
blend it out my finger and then I take
my little brush from Sigma that I always
use and blend it out even more then
taking this color tattoo I think I
forget what this one's called but I'm
gonna take a flat shader brush brush and
just apply this all over the lid and I
just love this fresh kind of makeup look
because it's not too much but you still
look put together and then I'm also
going to take the color Naked 2 in The
Naked basics palette and I'm just going
to apply this into my crease
and all I'm doing here is just taking
that same color tattoo and putting it
back on my lid and just kind of building
it up and it also forgot to mention that
these color tattoos are fantastic I have
really oily lids but these still stay in
place all day for me and what I really
like about him is I can use them as
eyeshadows I can use them as liner
you know smudge it underneath my lower
lash line I think they're just gorgeous
and a necessity to have so I just love
it and then of course I blend out any
harsh edges with my blending brush and
then I'm taking the color wo s and that
Naked basics palette and I'm just
highlighting with it and then for my
brows I'm going to use my Tarte
waterproof brow mousse this is amazing
totally totally needed for summer if you
want your eyebrows to stay in place
because they will literally not go
anywhere and I know my mirrors shaking
like a madwoman in the background but I
love this brow mousse you've seriously
got to give it a try and just remember
to start off lightly with the mousse and
then build up the color because it's
very very pigmented now I'm just
reaching in my drawer to get my brow
mousse from tweezerman and this is going
to help our brow stay in place even
longer
now I have to have a long wear liquid
eyeliner for summer because I always
wear liner and I have to make sure it
stays on so this one's been my favorite
lately it's the Jordana semi-permanent
eyeliner and this is such a fabulous
liner it's super black stays on forever
and it creates a really nice winged out
liner
everything
everything now I'm going to take this
Kohl pencil from rimmel and I think it's
in the color nude this is one of my
favorite eye brightener ever it's just
super natural and gorgeous and I'm just
going to put this on my waterline to
brighten up my eyes even more and then
I'm taking the color Naked 2 again and
I'm just going to smudge this underneath
my lower lash line with the pencil brush
to give some more dimension to the look
then taking the Tarte eyelash curler I'm
going to curl my lashes and I love is
eyelash curler because it makes them so
so curled then I'm taking the Mac
smolder eye Kohl I need a new one soon
and I'm just going to line my upper
waterline just so there's no like bear
skin on the upper part of my eyelid
applying waterproof mascara the L'Oreal
telescopic and then applying this
translucent powder is the makeup forever
super matte loose powder this is great
in conjunction with the makeup forever
math of it plus because this will keep
you Mac I swear by it I talk about these
products most of them all the time
because they're great products and they
do what they say and they honestly last
forever
moving onto products last forever any of
the Amazonian products from Tarte this
is the Amazonian clay bronzer in hotel
heiress and I love this because again it
lasts forever any of the Amazonian
products from Tarte are gonna last you
for a very long time so that's what I'm
using in this video and I got this
bronzer off of Hope look a while back
and then going with the Amazonian clay
again taking the blush tipsy and going
to apply this to my cheeks keep in mind
these Amazonian clay products last for
hours and they're just amazing so
definitely recommend trying them out and
then I'm taking the NYX butter gloss in
creme brulee and I'm just applying that
to my lips don't want to do anything too
crazy and then I'm just going to apply
my scare to my bottom lashes and that is
the whole look so I hope you guys
