a haul video and I purchased quite a bit
of stuff over the past couple weeks and
I figured I would show you guys before I
put all this stuff away so yeah we're
just gonna go ahead and get started
first thing I'm going to start with is
this shampoo and I want to go ahead and
say I did not know this was a
sulfate-free shampoo I'm not a big fan
of sulfate free shampoos even though I
know that they're good for your hair I
don't like them so we'll see how I like
this but it's the caviar anti-aging
replenishing and moisture shampoo and if
you're wondering about my hand I tried
to film this video once and I didn't
work out I'm excited to try this I've
heard great things about this line but
if it doesn't lather really well I'm
definitely gonna return it because I
like shampoos that lather really nicely
in the hair next is something I
repurchase this is the boss Pia is it
Bosca or Basia it's a one or two wash
kabocha alright but it's the makeup
breakup coal cleansing oil and I love
this stuff I'm almost out of mine and I
will definitely be doing a nighttime
routine for you guys very soon I have so
many routine videos to get up for you
but this is like my favorite cleansing
oil ever I have sensitive skin this
stuff does not break me out and takes
off all my makeup oh I can't say enough
good things about it and then another
thing I had to repurchase is my daytime
moisturizer which a lot of you know is
the philosophy take a deep breath
moisturizer I love this if you have oily
skin you will love it as well it's an
oil free gel moisturizer so it really
sinks into the skin nicely but it still
moisturizes your skin which you do want
even though you do have oily skin you
still want to moisturize it now moving
on to newer items I got the AL genis
overnight restoring cream and if you
watch my products I'm used up video
which if you haven't I'll link it down
below but if you watched it you know I
had a sample of this and I absolutely
loved this branch and every time I try a
sample from them
I love the moisturizer so I decided to
splurge being here I feel like is the
one thing I don't mind spending a lot of
money on because makeup starts from the
skin up take care of that skin and your
makeups gonna look ten times better but
it'll have a long-term benefits as well
nice frosted glass jar and it is just so
nice it looks like it's gonna be a
thicker cream which I love thicker
nighttime creams so I'm really excited
to try this out you guys know I'll be
updating you on if I love it or not
because I think I'm gonna love it this
is the last skin care I am
it's the glam glow a thirsty mud
hydrating treatment I've heard so many
people talk about this almost and
everybody's favorites videos and I
wanted to try it out because I'm all
about making sure my skin is nice and
moisturized and opening this up it
smells so good
so like coconut and like the beach and I
love since like that and then I got to
skincare samples I got the sample of
this is this Clinique repair where laser
focus is smoother toy restores and
corrects because I try this out it has a
really awesome reviews and then I also
got this sample this is one of the
samples of forehead but it's a glam glow
bright mud eye treatment and again the
curd great things okay really quickly
I'll mention these I've got some more V
deliver on it self-tanning mix these are
my favorite myths along with this Saint
Tropez self tanning ones I purchased
some from Ulta and they really scratched
my skin like I was putting self-tanner
on my chest and it like hurt to put my
self tanner on so going back to these
guys I think they're the same price and
I just liked him a lot better first
thing I got for my makeup is this Bobbi
Brown
3 pan palette I got this because I'm
going to New York IMATS and I wanted
something like this for my Bobbi Brown
products my two blushes I have from her
and my eyeshadow that I look so I can
just take them along with me instead of
having three little pans and this is a
nice little sized mirror it's just
really cute and it has Bobby Brown on
the front so I like that this was like
ten dollars - it was super affordable
onto makeup I did get the clinic up on
the lash mascara actually have it on
nail I do like it just takes a little
bit more time cuz the wand is
significantly smaller but it is a great
bottom lash mascara it gets from the
base to the tips of your lashes and it
looks so good your lashes look super
super long this is a blush from
Illamasqua and this is called excite and
I'm really excited about this blush
because
time i swatched this and I go to wipe it
off it stains my skin like at this
that's the same because I can't wipe it
off so this is the color excite it's
like a coral orange color it's very very
vibrant you're gonna have to use a light
hand with this but I think it's gonna be
a great long wearing blush and it's my
first Illamasqua product and I'm really
excited to try some more things so if
you have any favorites from Illamasqua
let me know in the comments below but I
also love the packaging of these I think
it's super cute next I got this lorac
perfectly lit oil-free luminizing powder
and this is on sale and support because
so fora is no longer selling lorac in
their stores anymore or they're on the
way of making sure they're moving on out
but you can get Laura at Ulta and like
Kohl's and things like that anyways this
is a perfectly lint Luminizer and I
really like this it's a nice kind of a
champagne shade it's not too intense I
think it'd be a great everyday Luminizer
because it's not something like steals
eyeshadow and kitten or anything so yeah
really excited tries out I'm gonna let
you guys know what you think of it next
thing I got is this cover FX bronzer
this is called a Sun Tan and I don't
want to try new bronzers just cuz I've
been sticking to the ones that I love
which I have no complaints about them
but I always love trying new ones so
this one's like I said cover FX and
suntan it's a gorgeous brown shade with
like some ash in it and it's just gonna
look so nice as a contour I feel like
it's super smooth blends out so
amazingly yeah I can't wait to try this
because it's not Warren Jin it's not red
it's just a nice matte Brown next is
this Becca highlighter this was actually
recommended from a subscriber I can't
remember who but she left a comment
saying I should try out opal I listened
to you and went got opal and I'm
officially obsessed with this too you
guys know I love my moonstone
highlighter from Becca and this equal
one is oh so pretty oh my gosh I love
it's a golden highlight these Becca
highlighters or everything they're so
smooth and they're just so pretty and
then these are new at Sephora I last
time I checked they were all sold out
because I wanted another color but this
is a
ambient lighting blush I'm not a huge
fan of the ambient lighting powders I
just don't feel like they do anything
for me I'm like the one person that
thinks that they don't do anything
because everybody else like loves them
but this one's in the shade radiant
magenta and it's like a baby doll pink
color it's going to look so pretty in
the spring and summertime and I don't
think these are super luminizing in my
opinion I can still wear a highlighter
with these the color that I have looks
more on the matte side so yeah I don't
know if these are supposed to be like
all luminizing or anything but this one
I don't feel like is so yeah but it's a
really pretty shade super super
pigmented and the packaging is really
cute as well if you guys haven't noticed
most of the stuff in this Hall is
blushes bronzers and highlighters I have
problem yeah I got some things from the
Sephora line I haven't really tried much
from the support line but I wanted to
kind of branch out and try different
things
I got a highlighter from them this is
called Stardust I do like this shade
it's like a white gold kind of color I
hope it's gonna look really nice on the
cheeks and not too white and fake
hopefully it's gonna look nice so this
one is called a Magna beam and it's a
really pretty pink blush with a little
bit of peach in there and these are the
kinds of blushes that are gonna give you
kind of a glow there's no shimmer in
them but they have a really gorgeous
Sheen to them so this one like I said
it's called mango bean and then you have
this one this is basically the same
color just a little bit darker and it is
guava glow so if you are trying to
decide between mango Beam and guava glow
guava legit glow is just a little bit
darker than this one and they're
basically the same shape and then this
one is my favorite because it's an
orange color this is called tangerine
tease and it is so pretty I cannot wait
to apply this I'm a huge fan of like
orange coral blushes and then I dig it a
bronzer from Sephora I'm actually
wearing it today as my contour shade and
it is called Lowe's Cabos this was the
only matte one that I saw by Sephora and
I really like this it looks super light
but it's kind of like the hoola bronzer
from benefit it looks really light in
the pan but it comes out a lot darker on
your skin the only thing about this one
is it does have quite a bit of Fallout
and power just
ten starts going everywhere but the
price difference between this one and
the benefit hoola I mean this is
basically the same thing Shh and say
that I'm moving on to things that I got
from Mac I got this blush this was
inspired by SML XO I believe she's the
one I've seen talk about this I have
watched that girl for literally years I
always loved her recommendation so this
is called Lovejoy it's kind of like a
bronzy gold dark plum II color it's a
mix of colors but it's so pretty I'm
gonna have to use a light hand with it
because it's very pigmented so I'm
really excited to try this out I love
Max marelize blushes the only one I
don't like this warm stubble and that's
because it never shows up on my skin so
these next three things are from the new
flower collection I'm not sure exactly
what it's called this is called perfect
topping and it's a really gorgeous
highlighter it is a released product and
I've just been really into highlighters
lately so this one is absolutely
stunning it doesn't have a lot of
shimmer in it but it gives a nice glow
to your skin and yeah I'm excited to
play with this a little bit more and
then the tulip tribes I got from that
collection is this one called a naked
bud
and at first I was I thought I was gonna
return it once I tried it on my lips
I really do like it it's a luster so
it's not like an amplified cream where
it's super super pigmented or anything
like that it's a little bit more sheer
and a little bit more glossy but it's
not as sheer as like a lip balm like
it's not like a tinted lip balm or
anything like that so I love this though
it does have some shimmer in it but when
you put it on your mouth you can't
really tell there's shimmer and it just
gives a nice kind of shiny effect like
you have a gloss on top and I really do
like it I think it's gonna be a great
everyday lipstick and then the last
thing is a cream Sheen glass which I
never tried a cream stained glass before
till today because I did put it on this
is in the color nectar suite again from
that collection it's like a peachy color
with some shimmer in it it doesn't look
like super shimmery on the lips and if
you're not a big fan of super sticky lip
glosses you will like this because it's
not sticky at all at least to me I don't
think it's sticky so that is it for this
video I hope you guys enjoyed this haul

your eye on on Sephora or the drugstore
