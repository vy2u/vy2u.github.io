a few gifts 18 actually that are under
$20 this is for makeup lovers I wanted
to find different makeup products that
you could find under $20 either for
stocking stuffers or you can use them as
a present to somebody I found quite a
bit of stuff so I'm really excited to
show you guys okay starting off with
Walgreens I'm going to show you guys a
couple makeup products the first one is
this little box from Fergie this is the
wet and wild brand when Wilde is really
well known for their eyeshadows and
stuff because they're super cheap you
get really great quality and I saw these
and I thought it was a great deal so
these are $10 and it's like a little
booklet just open it up first off you
have tutorials over here and then you
have an eyeshadow palette with purples
and like a black you get lashes mascara
a little brush and an eyeliner and this
would be a great gift for anybody even
if like they're just starting out or
something
this would be awesome if they love
purple they would love this little
palette and again with the tutorial on
this side I think would be really
awesome gift and for $10 you can't pass
it up one more thing from the wet wild
furry line that I thought was
interesting this was eight dollars and
you get a limited edition to reflect
your palate so this is like a shimmering
palette you can use as a highlighter
blush eyeshadows whatever you wanted to
and it also comes with a little kabuki
this little thing is all scratched up
but it comes with a little kabuki as
well as you can see so I thought this
was really cute tube for any makeup
lover and they just want to try out some
like new highlighters or blushes this
would be a great gift and it's only
eight dollars which is awesome and then
the last thing I found at Walgreens were
these elf nail polish kits and I thought
these were amazing it comes with 12
different nail polishes great colors
might I add I just love the colors of
these and these were only ten dollars
which is awesome I haven't tried elfs
nail polishes but I was gonna pop it
open and see if I liked it but I'm not
opening any of this stuff yeah I thought
it was a great value though I'm the 12
nail polishes for 10 dollars that's less
than a dollar piece you really can't
beat that so I love this I thought the
colors were gorgeous and for any nail
polish lover I think they would really
enjoy this now from a Walmart I found a
few things first off
these sets from Maybelline which I
thought were really cute these were
under $10 they were like nine dollars
and some change and they just looked
like this they have little eyeshadow
palettes with a mascara an eyeliner so
this one right here has the colossal
this is their Lion Express liner and
then you have these eye shadows that are
purple this one's called perfect pastels
so that's one of the gift sets and then
another one is this one it has the
modern metallics quoi which I think I
used to be obsessed with a long time ago
it comes with a great lash mascara and
another little eyeliner which is awesome
and these also do come with tutorials on
the back of these boxes which is awesome
for people that are again maybe starting
out with makeup or you just want another
idea on how to use these products this
one is a great value as well this was I
think nine dollars and some change to
come with the Maybelline mega plush
mascara and an eye liner great value
this would be awesome to put like just
in a stocking or something and it says
on the back very black onyx
so the mascara and the eyeliner are very
black so I thought this was really cute
and then the last oh I didn't even
mention these also from Walgreens for
the girls who love makeup but just need
something to help store their makeup I
found these cute little bins at
Walgreens this one was London in New
York this is a brush holder and you get
a bigger one and a smaller one you could
put like eye brushes in this one face
brushes and this one I thought was a
great deal when you see how mushy these
are seven ninety-nine at Walgreens which
is a great deal and I thought was super
cute they're clear so they'll go with
pretty much any room decoration whatever
and I mean who doesn't want extra
storage right and then this one was I
believe $9.99 yes
this one was $9.99 and this one is great
as well you can also put brushes in this
if you wanted to you could do like
little lipsticks here your everyday
makeup here you could put little brushes
up here if you wanted to so again
another great idea for a girl who wants
some more storage for her makeup she
could do to set this on top of her desk
or her dresser and be good to go and
then it lasts things from Walmart I know
I'm kind of scatterbrained I should have
organized it this is for the girls that
need
she's in their life like makeup brushes
so I chose these brushes to give as
Christmas gifts and these are the ones
I've tried out and stand by so this is
why I'm choosing them this is the Real
Techniques core collection this is an
awesome brush set basically for the face
you get the buffing brush foundation
brush and then the contour brush love
all of them you can use them for
anything I love this set I think it's
around $15 like 14 and some change but
they're awesome great brushes everybody
raves about them because they're so
affordable yet they still do the job and
they do it beautifully and then also
this one which was $9.99 see Real
Techniques stippling brush and this is
great for foundation blending out colors
on your face I mean it's just good stuff
you can ply blush with it bronzer it
does so many things so stifling brush is
also a great one to keep in mind okay
then I went to Ulta and had a little fun
because I love the gift sets at Ulta and
like support and stuff comes out with
but sometimes it is very hard to find
little sets like that that come out in
under $20 it's just hard sometimes so
the first thing I got was this Stila
elegant emerald collection lip gaze trio
I thought this was so pretty I mean
these are very neutral shades but
they're gorgeous
I think majority of the girls would like
these just because they're great
everyday colors so you could pick that
little guy up another thing that they
had going on is these and Mariah Carey
OPI nail polishes you've get two for 15
or split them up as one gift and another
gift this one is one with blues and
blacks it's called oh this is like the
liquid sand stuff I didn't know that so
these are like the liquid sand stuff but
this one has a blue a silver and a black
and then you have the big full-size ones
here and this one has a big kind of
chunky glitter what is that they're like
super chunky it looks like you'll have
like diamonds on your nails comes with a
regular shade and then a glitter shade
so I mean 2 for 15 for OPI and you get
six colors you can't beat that next is
this Smashbox try it kit this was $19
and you get the Smashbox full exposure
mascara the Smashbox lip enhancing gloss
also the crayon
liner photo finish foundation primer and
the photo finish lid primer which will
be your eye primer and this with $19
this would be great for somebody just to
try out their stuff again they could
basically have everything they need to
kind of start out you got your primers
you got your bases your liners your
mascara I think this is a really awesome
set in Smashbox is a very good brand so
I would highly recommend checking this
out I was really excited to find this
because I thought it was just the cutest
set and it's the Too Faced better than
sex
I essentials so in this when you get the
Too Faced better than sex mascara the
Too Faced shadow insurance and also a
little eye shadow and I guess it's
called exclusive I don't know well
actually it's a full-size eye shadow in
here and it's only 15 dollars for these
three items and it's cute this would be
an awesome stocking stuffer I also found
this which I thought was really cool so
that's heart thoughtful treasures little
trio this was $19 as well comes with a
pure mary tjuku oil because with the
Amazonian clay 12-hour blush and
thankful and a lips urgent in energy
this is so cute I love this I think it
would be such a great idea and I'm
surprised that they have this little
mini in here and it's $19 like that's a
great deal in the last gift I want to
give you guys as an idea is this benefit
lip lotto this is three different
lipsticks in here now I don't know the
shades because I haven't opened it and I
don't really want to open it oh but they
have it at the top you have ladies
choice fan game and la-la-land
and from what it looks like on the back
it looks like a full-size lipstick so I
know this is adorable this was only $18
which is awesome
so definitely check this out if you have
a lipstick lover in your life because it
has great neutral shades you can use for
everyday and it comes in a cute package
okay so that is it for my gift ideas
