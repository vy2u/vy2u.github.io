Holiday Gift Guide and I figured I would
go ahead and get this filmed and get it
up for you guys since Black Friday is
around the corner some of the items I
mentioned I don't have some of them I
won so of course I don't have them but I
will have a picture right here of the
items so you can see what I'm talking
about through the video I also want to
mention that I did send out a tweet to
guys asking you what you wanted for
Christmas because I was doing a
Christmas guide and you know I wanted
some different ideas from you all and if
you you're wondering what am i stroking
I'm stroking Daisy she's right here just
to chill in so you guys give me a bunch
of things that you were one for
Christmas and I'm gonna be including
them in this video today so yeah the
first thing I recommend is the
Clarisonic this is a great gift for
almost everybody unless they're really
really young and they honestly don't
need this but I mean for your mom or
your sister or somebody like that they
would really enjoy this this makes a
world of difference for your skin and I
love it they actually have the original
Clarisonic on sale for $100 so I would
definitely check that out because that's
a really good deal I do have the Nia too
and it's been the best purchase of sale
it's been the best purchase I've ever
made and I adore it so I think the
Clarisonic would make a great gift now I
know Olay the brand in the drugstore
they have something like that that's
around $30 so if you don't want to spend
100 to $150 on the original Clarisonic I
would definitely give the Olay one a try
now a lot of you said you wanted a
makeup or like makeup palettes so I'm
just including my favorite ones two of
them are from my November favorites so
if you haven't seen them then these are
new to you but the Sigma warm neutrals
palette this is actually launching this
summer night but it's the perfect
palette for you know girls who love
their neutral shades if they're just
starting out with makeup if they've done
makeup for a while they will love this
they're so creamy
they blend amazingly and I just enjoy
this palette so much so whenever it
comes out you should definitely check it
out there's always a discount code for
Sigma below but force it off does work
for everything on the site because they
always have a temperature
I'll code every month for you guys next
is a Smashbox master class palette
number two and I love this this is an
awesome palette you have a ton of
eyeshadows on this side and then on this
side I even have some liners or you can
use these as basis if you wanted to you
have six different shadows kind of one
that's more of a bronzer and then you
have two highlighters down here so this
is an awesome all in one palette I love
this one it is so pigmented and I think
it's like one of the best palettes I
have ever tried in my life so definitely
in Smashbox masterclass to palette is
just like hands-down one of my favorites
and then you can't go wrong with an
oldie but a goodie which is the original
Naked palette I think this is one of the
best palettes to go to the only downside
is they only have a one a matte shade in
here I'm sorry no make that two you only
have to matte shades in here when you
have more in these Smashbox masterclass
palette but this is like an all-time
favorite for me I think it's a beautiful
palette and I definitely had to include
it now if you know the girl that you're
you know buying stuff for and you want
to get her some shoes I have three pairs
of booties that I recommend and they are
really really affordable and they're all
from Kohl's
because I got them not too long ago so
the first two are actually from Lauren
Conrad's line and I got these they were
on sell for $45 but of course Black
Friday sales are coming up and they're
probably marked down a lot more so these
are the first pair of booties I think
they're so so cute they have like this
wrap around the detail love I also got
them in this color so cute I love these
the girl you're shopping for loves like
simple booties I definitely recommend
Lauren Conrad's line she has it great
stuff and then there's these pair
booties that I really love I got these
on sale for I think $30 and I know I saw
these in the Kohl's ad and they're on
sale for like $20 for Black Friday
and they just look like this I love them
I think they're so cute they're such a
casual bootie and they're very very
comfortable as well and you can't beat
20 bucks for a pair of shoes so
definitely recommend Kohl's and their
shoes because I've been really really
impressed by these next I want to show
you guys some scarves I think scars are
a great thing
I've personally just signed in the scars
this year and my favorite are definitely
from H&amp;amp;M
they're all from H&amp;amp;M yes so I have this
one right here which is kind of a camel
color and it is an infinity scarf I
think simple scarves like this are a
better idea to give us a gift because I
don't know I personally don't like
pattern scarves or ones that are super
busy just because I like to kind of
finish off an outfit with a scarf so I
love the kind of plain and simple ones
and these are like 1295 at H&amp;amp;M so you
can't beat that so that one and then you
have this one which is more of like an
eyelet kind of fabric and it's again a
circle scarf that can pretty much go
with anything and this one was 14.95 so
a little bit more expensive but still
super cute and then this one's one to go
more just around the neck and not be so
low which I love actually have a black
one like this from forever 21 that I use
all the time but this is what it looks
like it's just a nice cream shade and it
really just sits up at the neck really
nicely so it keeps you nice and warm and
I just love this so I think this would
be a great gift as well next I want to
mention a nail polish set and this is
awesome actually ordered it for myself
and I loved it I cannot wait to play
with all the glitters and just all the
colors so it is a sephora formula x-22
kits has twenty two nail polishes from
Sephora's new formula X line and I've
heard that these are some awesome nail
polishes you get the plain shades and
you get ones on metallic you get ones
with glitters and it's just a great
little gift I need to be great for a
girl who loves nail polish I could never
get through this whole set this would be
a complete nail polish collection for
somebody so I think it's an awesome set
to pick up next time I talked to you
guys about new me and you guys know I
love new me I stand by them 100% they
have been a great company and I've never
had a problem with the tools from them
and if you're wondering I did use a 25
millimeter one today and I'll show you
guys how I do this and a holiday look
them doing next week so of course I'm
always trying to ask a new me you know
different coupon codes I can get for you
guys and they actually gave me 3
different packages for you guys for the
holiday season which will be great
because you can get these just in time
for Christmas and give them to the
family member or friend that you want to
give them to and the packages are really
awesome I will leave all the details of
them down below but they're great I know
one is like you can get a curl like a
set of curling irons a blow dryer and
like an oil or something for like a
hundred and fifty nine dollars which it
would be so much more if you bought them
separately so I will leave all those
down below and I know a lot of you have
been asking about the megastar now I
have been working on this for you guys
because they are sold out of the black
one but they did inform me that my
megastar coupon code also works for the
hot pink one that they have in stock so
you can use my coupon for the hot pink
one and you can get it for like $99 and
that's one of my favorite flat irons
ever talked about all the time I know
you guys have seen it but I just want to
let you guys know could you even ask me
for some holiday coupons from nume I
feel like hair tools are always a great
gift to give because sometimes girls
don't really treat themselves and get
really nice hair tools because they
don't think they need it but like
awesome hair tools will change the way
your hair looks and it will just make
everything ten times better last longer
so that's a great gift idea at least I
think so now the next gift idea is
something that I actually want I want a
Polaroid camera they come in so many
different colors they're called um well
they're by the brand huger film or
something I don't know I'll leave all
these products I'm talking about down
below in the description box they're
honestly not a bad price they're about
sixty to seventy dollars and they're so
cute I just love the idea of taking a
picture and printing out of the camera
right then I think it would be great for
scrapbooking which I've tried to do
lately so I just think it's such a great
idea I want a Polaroid so bad so I will
leave a link down below so you guys can
go check out what I'm talking about
because it is seriously so stinking cute
I love it nice is the perfume and I
think this is one that everyone will
love because I've never heard anybody
complain about this perfume and I'm used
it for years
it's the Viva La Juicy perfume and it's
just original Viva La Juicy not the
Lafleur anybody or anything like that I
love this perfume it lasts so long this
by far is the most long-lasting perfume
that I have it's amazing I was great
about perfumes for the holidays as they
come in awesome gift sets so you can
even take that gift set and like give a
lotion to one per
say and give the rollerball to another
and then give the perfume to someone
else so you could have basically three
gifts in one I think perfumes are just a
great gift because everyone that likes
to smell good and I feel like this is
one of the best perfumes this is the
last product I'm going to mention to you
guys and a lot of you tweeted me let me
know that you're asking for Sigma
brushes for Christmas but you can also
get like travel sets they do have travel
sizes of their brushes like the mr.
bunny sets and stuff like that so I
would recommend looking at the travel
size sets because they're basically the
same exact brushes just smaller handles
so I mean if the handle doesn't bother
you then I would definitely check out
the travel ones because they are cheaper
than the full sized brushes so that is
it for my Holiday Gift Guide I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and yeah let me
know what you are wanting for Christians
down below like your number one thing
that you were just wanting so bad I want
to know because I want to go look at it
and see if I get some more ideas because
I honestly it's hard for me to think of
things that I want for Christmas look
Daisy likes the Stars
you like those Clara's baby so thank you
guys so much for watching give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and
all the products that I mentioned will
be listed in the description box below
and I will see you guys in my next video
