holiday party makeup look for you guys
um I love the holidays I love wearing a
red lip to a holiday party because it's
like the holidays all the agents is so
good so I wanted to film this look for
you guys it's pretty simple to do I feel
like this kind of Goldeneye is classic
to do with a red lip it's still really
smoky and really pretty but it has a
little bit of glitter in there as well
to make your eyes pop you know when the
light hits your face and everything so I
really really love this look I was gonna
do like more of an ombre lip but I
decided just to keep it classic and do a
plain red lip and I really like the way
that this turned out I didn't include my
hair I did use my extension switch with
my foxy locks and I use this curling
iron I'm using it a lot lately
ooh so it is that Hot Tools iron I think
it's like a 1 and 1/2 inch and I really
like this I'm using for my hair a lot
but I didn't do a tutorial but if you
guys do want to see like a holiday
hair and makeup tutorial like another
one I will be more than happy to do that
for you guys because this has been my
go-to hair look for a while now it's
just so voluminous and pretty so yeah if
you want to see how I got this makeup
look then just keep watching and don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you
liked it thank you guys again so much
and I quickly want to say I'm sorry I
didn't have a video up Tuesday and
Thursday of last week I was going videos
but they're not up yet so I've been
working I just haven't had time to film
a ton of videos at least last week I was
super slammed so I'm sorry about that
but I will be on track for this week and
next week as well so and then the weeks
after that but this week and next week
are gonna be slammed packed but I'm pre
filming a lot so let me know in the
comments what you guys want to see just
so I can bring them out for you guys so
again thank you so much for watching and
let's just get started with the video ok
so we're going to take the morphe 3 5 2
tee palette today we're going to take
this shade right here
and we're going to take a fluffy flat
brush and put this on our lid and also
drag it up to the crease I wanted this
to be my transition shade but once I put
it on my lid I realized how dark it was
so I started to just focus that whole
color on my lid and then drag the excess
into the crease just so it could be the
transition color but it's
not too dark okay now we're going to
take this shade right here and put this
right into the crease a little bit below
that shade that we had just put on and
this is just going to dip in it up a
little bit and this adds a little bit of
a cool toned look to it this is mostly a
warm toned look but I add a couple cool
toned colors in here just to give it
something extra you know something a
little different maybe not but I think
it looks good so again you just want to
fluff that into the crease now going in
with this beautiful warm shade right
here oh my god I love this color and I'm
taking a blending brush and putting this
in the outer V this is just going to
deepen it up without being too intense
I'm going to put a couple colors out
here in the outer V but we're going to
drag this one going in towards the
center of the lid and then we're going
to take one more shade and put one out
in the outer V but not go in as far so
I'm taking this all the way about
halfway and blending it a little bit
into my crease and then we're taking
this shade right here and putting this
in the very outer corner and then again
we're going to take that same brush we
had just used and blend that out just so
we don't have any harsh lines
now I'm going to take this shade right
here which is a really pretty glittery
bronzy gold color I'm going to put this
all over the center part of the lid and
I'm going to leave a little bit of the
inner corner bare so you just want to
pack this on and take it up to the
crease and they're going to take the
shade right beside it which is just a
little bit lighter and we're just going
to put that in the inner part of the eye
just to help kind of brighten up this
look a little bit
then we're going back in with that
really pretty warm brown and we're going
to put this into the crease this
blending brush I'm using goes to a
pointed tip so it's really easy to get
directly into the crease and not go too
crazy with this color and then we're
also going to take the color weaves in
the very outer V and put that back out
there just to help blend everything
together we're going to take our liner
into a winged liner and then I'm taking
these lashes from velour they're my
favorite right now how beautiful were
they I can't get over it so I went ahead
and primed my face with my Smashbox
primer warm Walmer a primer water and
pore minimizer and now I'm putting on my
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation I
just keep going back to it it's so
beautiful
I tried Estee Lauder the other day with
a Beauty Blender and I hated it so I'm
gonna try it with the brush again
because I was like oh my god I used to
love this foundation what happened but
this has been my favorite for a while
now I think it's just really awesome and
again it just has such a beautiful
finish and then I'm going in with this
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer and I'm
just going to put this underneath my
eyes and in the center of my face like I
always do and just blend it out it's
going to highlight the face and make it
look nice and bright
you
I'm going in with my Smashbox shake the
Mathers palette I'm taking the yellow
toned powder and I'm going to set all of
my concealer that I just put on my face
with this powder it's a really great
palette if you haven't picked it up yet
put it on your Christmas wish list or
something because it's amazing then I'm
taking this bareMinerals bronzer this
was from summer of last year I believe
so I don't think you can get it but you
can use any bronzer you want I've just
been using this one and I'm going to put
this on the tops of my forehead my
cheeks and just anywhere that the Sun
would naturally hit me
then I'm going to take this Kevin a Kuan
sculpting powder in medium this is so
pretty it's a cool-toned powder just
beautiful but it's not like too ashy oh
my gosh it is stunning
and I'm going to apply this underneath
my cheekbones to contour and I'm telling
you you need this in your life
I just started using again and I'm
obsessed the same with this blush this
blush is cantaloupe from Mac I forgot
how much I loved it but now I just I
cannot put it down so I usually like to
put quite a bit of this on I know it
looks a little crazy but I go in with a
duo fiber brush and just blend it out
and it looks so pretty on the skin it's
so warm oh I love it you guys and I
think you will love it as well then I'm
taking the benefit Watts up highlighter
and I'm going to put this on the tops of
my cheekbones if you went into Sephora
lately you can see my picture by the
Watts up highlighter which i think is
amazing I love this highlighter and I
think it's awesome that they have my
picture on display with it so go check
it out and send me a picture if you see
it because I just think it's so cool and
then taking the anasazi a dip brow and
filling in my brows then I'm taking this
shimmery highlighter in the palette of
the smashbox shapematters and I'm going
to highlight underneath my brows it's
just so beautiful then I'm taking my
NARS eyeliner and lining my waterline
with this and then we're going back in
with that shade right there and putting
this up against our lower lash line and
this is going to help smoke out this
look because we're going to take that
warm Brown once again and use this
makeup geek brush to blend this out and
it looks so smoky and sultry and just so
beautiful I love it oh I love this
makeup look I hope you guys love it as
much as I do then after I'm done with
that I'm going to go ahead and put
mascara on my bottom lashes as well and
then it is time to move on to lips so
I'm using a Maybelline lipliner in red
that's what it's called just red and I
just lined my lips with that and then I
took this the balm meets mattes I
believe it's called it's a liquid
lipstick and it's just a red color and I
put that all over and then I was done
with this look so I hope you guys
enjoyed it thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye guys
