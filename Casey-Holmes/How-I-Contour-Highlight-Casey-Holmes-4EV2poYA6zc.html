I contour and highlight I've been having
so many questions ever since I got this
brush on how I contour and things like
that and I figured I would go ahead and
do this video for you guys today and I
do love this brush this is like the star
of the show
it's the NARS eater brush and this is
what makes my contour look sharp blended
beautiful I love it so I'm gonna try to
head this down for you guys I know a lot
of people are having a hard time finding
it I think NARS discontent this
continuing they need to bring it back
but I think they did discontinued it I
found mine on Nordstrom a few months ago
so I'm going to kind of go on hunt and
see if I can find it for you guys first
off I want to show you guys favorite
bronzers and I have three favorite
bronzers that I like to go to the first
one is by benefit this ones who love it
looks super light once you put on your
skin it just creates a gorgeous shadow
and I absolutely love it it's just one
of my favorites obviously since I hit
pan on it another one is this one from
Bobbi Brown I love this to contour and
to bronze up the face I think it's just
a beautiful beautiful bronzer it's not
too dark not too light again that
perfect shade this one's in the color
golden light one and then last one is by
Too Faced and this is their old
packaging I do believe they have a new
packaging for this and it's the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer I have
the one in chocolate it looks like a
milk chocolate shade it is very very
pretty
smells like chocolate is delicious this
blends out so beautifully as well it's
just stunning so the top three bronzers
that I normally go to to contour and
things like that are these three
bronzers they're my absolute favorite
and then when we get to highlighting
I'll show you my favorite ones for that
and I'll show you the blushes I'll be
using for today so today I'm going to be
using my hoola benefit bronzer so I'm
going to take my NARS brush and I'm just
going to put it in the bronzer and tap
it off and then what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to line out my conch
first and then I'll go in and blend in a
little bit I have a couple other contour
and highlighting videos that I'll link
down below that I've done on my channel
so if you're interested in seeing those
and maybe products I use in those videos
you can check that out this is just how
I've always done it and that's just I'm
going to show you today so basically if
you look at my face sometimes you can
kind of see the hollows of my cheeks
especially when I don't have makeup on
you can just see that natural shadow
that I have so I pretty much know
already where to place my contour but if
you don't you can just angle your brush
up on the top of your ear and angle it
down and if you also just like take a
brush like this so if you just take the
brush on the top of your cheekbone and
you roll it down you'll fill that
indention on where the hollows right
under your right under your cheekbones
are so that's where your contour should
go and you'll see it just lines up right
there with the top of your ear as well
so there's different ways you can do
it's completely up to you whichever way
you can find your contour and then I
never go past the inner part of my eye I
don't like going really close to the
mouth just because I think it looks
really unnatural and I don't like the
look of having a line from here to here
what I'm going to do is I've already
dipped it in the bronzer and I'm just
going to start lining out my contour so
I'm just going to put like a buffed out
line here you can see that I'm going to
do the same so you can see over here
with the hollow of my cheek is and it
just naturally creates a shadow so I
just place the contour right in there
and you can see that's how it's looking
so far and then I like to go underneath
my jaw just to really define it and make
it look nice and sculpt it out when I
other favorite places to contour is
right below my lip it always makes my
lip look a little bit more pouty so I'm
going to take this and just place it
right underneath there
so it casts that shadow right underneath
your bottom lip and it just makes it
look more pouty and like kind of rolled
over in a way now I'm going to do my
nose I try to focus the product mainly
on the edges of the brush because that's
what I'm going to use to contour it
do have a larger nose is it's just going
to depend what kind of nose you have on
how you're in a contour I know Wayne
Goss has a really good video from like
back in the day all my different noses
and how you contour different ones but
for me mine is just really thick right
in here basically like the edges of my
nose and right here like a normal one
would but I have a bone right here that
just is wide and it extends out so it
makes the nose look a lot bigger so what
I'm going to do is emphasize that
natural kind of ending right here that I
have and it's just going to make it look
a lot slimmer and you know kind of just
show that I do have a nose and it's not
all the way out to here okay so I'm
going to take the edge of the brush and
go down these sides of my nose it's okay
if it's dramatic so far because we will
like I said blend it out so I go down
the sides and also go right here
underneath the tip okay so next to the
forehead as you can see I do have a
pretty large forehead so I definitely
want to contour it I mainly focus on
contouring the sides here I do bring
into the middle but I don't bring it
very far down because sometimes I can
feel like it looks a little too too much
like a little too much bronzer going on
but first I focus it over here on my
forehead I like to take it back into the
hairline pretty far back just so it
blends nicely down and I do that just so
there's not a line of contour and then
my skin and then my hairline because
that just doesn't look natural so going
to take the product again just dipped it
back into the hoola bronzer start at the
hairline then just buff it down like
this kind of towards my brow I'm going
right here I drag any excess in the
middle of my forehead but again just
kind of focusing it right here on the
outer parts of my forehead again just
buffing it into that hairline so you
can't tell the difference between the
contour and my hair so that's what you
look like it's not like a huge dramatic
difference but once you do it all it it
does make a difference especially if you
wear your hair up like this all right
and then to the
other side again doing the same thing
going into the hairline first and then
buffing it down this brush is awesome
because it just blends everything so
beautifully as long as you use a light
hand with it it's just it just blends
amazingly so again taking excess here in
the center but focusing it right here
we're going to start blending this stuff
out now I am going to take just a tad
bit more product on my brush and use it
to blend out this contour that I have
just because I want to look a little bit
more dramatic and just kind of blending
it out I want to make sure I'm going
upwards not down because that would
defeat the purpose of the contour so
just focus it upwards and I just kind of
blend it out however I feel isn't needed
I mean it makes contouring so easy it
did take me a couple times to figure out
how to contour really well with this
brush but once I got it down I was good
so you can see that one's not blended
out but that one is and it just looks
nice and sharp I find that I don't even
have to go in and clean up underneath my
contour because this brush makes it so
precise that is it's not me I don't have
to add extra product and do that so
again I need a little bit more product
and I'm just going to blend it upwards
and kind of buff it out and you can see
that my contour is basically ending at
the end of my eye which that's normally
where it's going to end for me because
like I said I don't like bring it in and
super far so that's the contour done
super easy literally takes no time like
no matter what I'm doing with my makeup
look I will always do a contour because
it doesn't take me long at all
now I'm going to start blending out my
forehead what I like to do is just take
a little bit of powder whatever powder
I'm using for the day this one is the
NYX blotting powder in a medium dark
it's obviously not medium dark but this
way I'll be using it is a very nice
blotting powder if you are wondering I
really do like it so I'm just going to
take a little bit of that and so
buffing this out just so it's not super
muddy or anything like that and the
duo-fiber really just helps blend
everything out and all the brushes I'm
using there's just that one NARS one but
the rest of them are stigma I'll leave
them down below so you can check them
out because they're amazing and I love
Sigma brushes then what I'm going to do
is take the smaller duo fiber and that's
this one from Sigma so you can see the
difference between the two this one's
definitely a lot smaller and then the
same thing just a touch of powder so I'm
just lending out then those contour
going right underneath my jawline to
just in Coos okay and then that is my
contouring done super super simple
I just I'm obsessed with it so for blush
I'm going to be using one from Sigma
these two are my favorite you have Melo
which is like a gorgeous just neutral
blush and then the same goes for serene
serene is one of my top favorite blushes
ever and I think I'm going to use this
one today so I'm going to be using my
Sigma large angled contour f40 and just
putting it into the product these are
very pigmented so just be warned you
only need a little bit I used to do my
blush I used to just do it right here on
the sides of my cheeks I wouldn't bring
it to the apples but lately I've been
really enjoying doing the apples on my
cheeks just because it really makes my
cheeks pop I really like the way it
looks makes my cheeks look a little bit
more rounded right here and I've just
been really enjoying it I think it looks
really pretty
so what I like to do is start from the
back and work my way forward I kind of
tap it and blend at the same time but I
like to start from the back just in case
I have too much product you can all be
back there and then drag a little bit
onto my cheeks right there on the apples
and blend it backwards this blush is so
beautiful I love it you got to try it
out so that's what looks like you can
see the difference from this side of my
face in this side it's just
really makes my cheeks pop and I love
bringing the blush to the apples of my
cheeks I used to think it made my face
look too round but now I'm like obsessed
with it I love it so again starting from
the back I'm kind of tapping and I do
smile while doing this just so I know
basically where I'm applying it and
again to the apples and blending it
backwards and then I again take the duo
fibre no powder on it and I'm just going
to blend this out I keep in mind when I
did the contour and I added powder you
don't have to add powder if you don't
want to the brush can blend it out
beautifully but sometimes I feel like if
I don't add a little bit of powder it
looks a little muddy and since I do have
pretty oily skin I can use powder to
blend different things out in my face it
will want kick up really bad or anything
now moving on to highlighters I have
three favorite highlighters as well and
I did not plan on having three of each
it just happened that way so the first
one is a cult favorite of mine this is a
mary lou manizer from the balm it's a
gorgeous gold kind of champagne shade it
is so pigmented you literally don't need
much of this at all but it is absolutely
stunning
another one is as becca highlighter in
moonstone this is basically kind of the
same thing as the balm one it's a little
less gold than the balm one so this is
the moonstone one right there it's just
a little bit less gold still really
gorgeous um I prefer more champagne gold
highlighters and then the next one this
is called superb from Mac this is from
their new dimension natural dimension
line I don't know I'll leave it down
below but this is one of their new
highlighters they came out with its
limited edition I do believe and this
one has been like my favorite I've been
using it non-stop and this one's kind of
like it's like it's like a little bit of
gold a little bit of pink it's really
pretty this is like the only kind of
pinky highlight I do like because once
it's on the cheek it doesn't look like
super pink or anything like that so I
really been enjoying this but definitely
the champagne gold ones are the
highlights that I usually go for if I'm
gonna buy a new one I take this Sigma
f-35 if you're gonna highlight I
definitely recommend this
I think this brush made me want to
highlight more just because it made it
so easy since it does have that tapered
end it's super easy just to get right on
top to your cheekbones and not overdo it
I used to do it with a fan brush and I
would tend to overdo my highlight get a
little bit too close to my eye or you
know would just be too crazy so this
brush is definitely my favorite you
wanna make sure you tap off the excess
so just apply to the tops of my
cheekbones I also take it up kind of
like in that C motion around my brow
that just creates a gorgeous highlight I
love it again tops of cheekbones and
around I do a little bit up there I also
like to take some highlight and do it
down my nose just to make my nose again
look a little bit smaller because when
the light reflects off of it it will
really emphasize that high point of your
nose and just make it look smaller
especially since you've got the contour
going on with it and the last thing I
like to do for highlight is just take it
on my ring finger put on top of my lip
just to make that look a little bit more
plumb and I like doing that on the top
of my lips just because it kind of goes
along with the shadow that we placed
underneath our bottom lip and if you
wanted even more you know ba-ba-boom you
could take the highlighter and press it
in the center of your lip but I don't
really feel me to do that now so I'm not
gonna do it that's basically how I
highlight in contour it's super super
easy as you saw and this is just like my
go-to Oh
like I said I'll try to find that brush
for you guys and leave it down below in
the description box so just check that
and see if we can find it it might have
to be on eBay or something I don't know
I did see one on Amazon but there was
like only one left I don't know if it's
still there or not but yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up if you did and I will see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
