sharing with you my highlight and
contour routine using in the new lorac
Pro contour palette and the pro contour
brush now I'm doing a review instead of
a first impression because I wanted to
test out the products and look at the
longevity of everything I would know
what the colors are like and with the
pigmentation and yeah I just wanted to
test it out for a couple weeks before I
did a full review and like demonstration
for you guys so yeah this is what we're
using today this is what the box looks
like of course mine is open but you do
get a little thing that goes over your
palette its palette right here it's the
same exact packaging as the eyeshadows
like the law provide shadows and I'll
show you inside use some moments and
then you also get a booklet which tells
you how to contour different face shapes
and it's just kind of like how I did
with the other video I reviewed about an
eyeshadow palette this is the exact same
thing just basically tell anywhere you
can contour and you draw a line on your
forehead and things like that also shows
you a different face shapes so it gives
you an easier look on what you should be
doing and then you get the contour brush
which is a nice brush it's a little bit
dense but I do like the shape of it it's
pretty thin in my opinion it's just easy
to get right there in that contour line
and really buff everything out so I
haven't set my face makeup or anything
with any powder I just put on my brows
and eyes and lips and my foundation of
course and my concealer I've done
everything but said it and I'm
contouring so you have this huge mirror
right here and then here is the palette
you have a beige highlight a yellow
highlight a shimmer highlight medium
contour deep Cohn sorry dude contour and
light contour you can't really see a
different you have beige highlight
yellow highlight and shimmer highlight
then you could tell the yellow is just a
bit tinted which I mean it's it's the
yellow highlight and then you have the
contour shades which are very very
committed
and yeah they're very pigmented so you
have light contour deep contour medium
contour I like that the medium contour
is a little bit bigger in this palette
just because I feel like more people are
probably going to gravitate towards that
for contouring or bronzing light contour
deep contour do contour is dark okay it
is it is dark so definitely for deeper
complexions it is dark it will it shows
up on your skin like crazy if you have
medium skin tone below I wouldn't
suggest deep contour unless you really
want to sculpt out and really just want
to be like BAM in your face but
definitely for darker skin tones oh my
gosh this would be amazing for you
because the color is just perfect
so and for me personally let me just let
me just show you instead of talking
we're gonna take that yellow highlight
sometimes I like to mix it with the
beige I honestly go back and forth with
these two because I like both of them
but today I'm just gonna use the yellow
highlight and I'm just going to set my
under eye concealer now I like this
yellow highlight a lot because it does
oh I forgot to put concealer on my nose
because it really does highlight the
face and it sets the concealer really
really nicely so I just I mean I really
really like it I'm a big fan of the
yellow powders I know some people think
it's a trend which it probably is but I
still really like them for bronzer and
things like that
I recommend the medium contour firm it
my skin tone to bronze and I will use a
duo fiber brush for this because I don't
want to pick up too much product I want
to be really really light handed with it
and I just don't want to pack it on
because they are very pigmented like I'm
not kidding when I'm saying they're very
pigmented you can stick your brush in
there and then you'll be like holy yeah
it's isn't it so I just like to take
this duo fiber brush just barely tap it
in there tap off the excess and then hit
the higher points of my face now this
palette is $45 and it's going to be at
Ulta exclusively for two weeks
I'll leave the exact dates on the screen
in here but it's gonna be exclusively at
Ulta which we got a little old tub I
think I want to do one side of my face
and then show you
how's that sound good okay and it's like
a $145 value so you're getting a really
good deal I mean these pallets are
really big right now and I mean
everybody's loving them because who
doesn't honestly want an all-in-one kind
of pallet you know what I mean
especially for contouring pamphlets
really handy too because if you honestly
don't know how to contour which a lot of
people don't believe it or not a lot of
people don't watch YouTube videos it's a
really helpful way for the average
person to just figure out how to contour
their face as long as they can figure
out their face shape they're good to go
so I am gonna do this side first and
then we're going to show you the
difference between this side and this
side so like I said I like that bronzer
a lot too just bronze up the skin I put
it right here below my jaw line I like
to put some on my cheeks and then at the
top of the forehead and I'll even run
just a little bit right here by my
temple it's not like bronzer Blanc
bronzer Blanc you don't have same thing
um yeah I just do that and then now
we're gonna take the candy dandy brush
that it comes with and we're gonna take
the light shade now I just pressed it in
there barely and that's how much product
came off so I'm not Coon when I say be
careful tap off the excess and then you
just want to follow I'm trying to just
without getting on my face you just want
to follow from the top of your ear to
the corner of your mouth that's just
gonna give you the best contour line
it's just right underneath your
cheekbone you can actually feel it if
you just fill your face so I'm just
going to take it back by my ear and
carve out
right underneath like that and then keep
in mind it's good to just start out
small and then work your way up and I
just like to kind of go in and buff it
out and like flick it up a little bit
just so it all blends nicely into the
cheekbone you see how that is and you
can see it's like this is good for I
feel like every single day you can use
the medium contour if you want to but I
like the light one just because it's not
super super dramatic you know what I
mean and it kind of has an ashy tone in
the light one so I really really like it
and I think it'll be great for pretty
much anybody this palette can really
work for anybody you know what I'm
saying okay so again I'm gonna take a
little bit tap it off and I'm gonna go
to the top of the forehead I have a very
big forehead so but I embrace it you
know ever since Tyra Banks I like
embrace the big forehead because I'm
obsessed so what I like to do is I place
my contour right here on the corners and
a little bit in the center so that it
just kind of gives the illusion of a
smaller forehead so I'm gonna take this
I'm gonna go right here
and just buff that down and then go
towards the center and with this one
since we did already bronze you don't
need a lot of this but this just adds
that extra shading effect to the face so
you just want to kind of bring it to you
and into the center like that like oh my
god do you see the difference already go
lamb glia glam glam my favorite part is
during my jaw line I always noticed such
a difference in my jaw line so what I
like to do is just go you see where this
kind of shadow is right here I'm just
gonna follow it so just go right
underneath right here just follow that
jaw line and then just blend it out take
your excess and blend then the last
place I'm going to contour is right
underneath my lip so where that
indention is right there just do it
right underneath your lip it doesn't
have to be super dramatic or anything
like that what it does is it kind of
fold it looks gives the illusion of your
lips folding over so it gives the
illusion of bigger lips which I like
last thing I like to do is just go in
back in with that brush and take a
little bit of that medium contour like
I'm talking just a tad bit and I'll just
blend one more time everywhere so just
blend it all out and then that's what
that looks like and you just want to add
some blush okay so now we've got a
little bit of blush on add a little bit
of color we're going to take it the
shimmer highlight and put that on the
top of the cheekbone so I like to take
more of a smaller brush or you could
honestly use this one just flip it over
actually we'll just do that you can flip
this over tap off the excess I like beat
my brush as when I talk about the excess
and then we're just gonna put it right
here at the top of the cheekbone right
above where we put our blush look at how
pretty that is
I'm telling you this is the only palette
I've been like oh yes I'm obsessed with
it it's beautiful like it is it's
stunning I'm obsessed with it that
grunting noise is not cute though that's
what it looks like isn't it so gorgeous
so I put it right there at the top of
the cheekbone and then I also do right
above my brow just like that gives a
glow and then I like to do just a little
bit down my nose and why usually to top
my lip to already have lipstick on you
usually I do all this first so yeah
that's what it looks like I'm just so
obsessed with this palette I don't even
get non-stop now the longevity of this
is amazing it lasts all day for me and
the pigmentation is obviously there it's
beautiful and just I mean you could see
what contouring and highlighting it does
for your face it just creates such a
huge difference this one is more defined
face looks slimmer
this one looks really basic and it
doesn't even look cute it looks like I
did full glam it didn't want
anything else my face yeah I'm gonna go
ahead and finish this side of my face
and we'll get back to it okay guys so
that is it for this tutorial
I hope you guys enjoyed it and enjoyed
the little review I did on this palette
I really loved it there's only one shade
I can't use in here which is the deep
contour maybe for like Halloween
tutorials for like a strong contour I
can but it's just way too deep for my
skintone but everything else I can use
and I just really really loved it I
highly recommend it so I almost forgot
gonna Joe has a big mirror actually no I
did say that I hope you guys enjoyed
