how I contour and highlight I did on
this over the weekend and it was just so
boring and oh I know I was gonna upload
it I'm glad I did it I have a loaded
outfit of the day instead and I decided
to refill it today because I want to add
some music and like you know make it
kind of upbeat and you want to watch it
because I didn't want to watch the whole
thing so I am doing a voiceover at
adding music at least you have a
voiceover to know what you're doing
really quickly I'm gonna tell you what I
have on my face before I even started of
course I have my Revlon age-defying
concealer and medium love this stuff for
underneath my eyes it really just
brightens up everything and it covers so
well I just absolutely love it so I have
that and then I've been loving this to
use on my face like to cover any redness
anything like that and it's just the
timebomb concealer from the balm and
this is a medium I was afraid it's gonna
be too dark but it actually works for I
think so have that on and then I just
have my rocker Republic powder in
cashmere and that's all I started out
with in the video I will show you each
product in the video and the brush I
used all brushes are from Sedona lace
these three are from the vortex
collection you have the FBO one FBO five
and the FBO three these are all from the
vortex collection you can also buy them
individually into the individually
lately lately individually so if you're
interested you can totally buy these
separate and then this one that I used
to contour just your old-fashioned
angled blush brush I think this is great
for contouring don't get me wrong the
dome shape one is two but I like this
more to buff out lines but this is from
the essential kit that I bought not too
long ago and I really love this you can
find this like at a drugstore like I
have this old one from essence of beauty
if you prefer but I really like this I
think it works perfectly fits right in
there
what's amazing I didn't make it darker
for the purpose of this video so you
guys can see kind of what I'm doing I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I will
see you all in my next video
Bop
okay so what I'm doing here is I'm
taking the handle of my brush I'm
rolling it over my cheekbone and
whenever you feel kind of like the
hollow of your face that's where you
want to place your contour and I use
right the top of my ear as kind of like
my guideline I'm using the hoola benefit
bronzer which is just a really nice and
matte bronzer and the 850 brush from
Sedona lace make sure you tap off any
excess and I'm working from the back and
I'm going forward and again using kind
of the top of my ear as my guideline for
this contour
I also like to stop right here at the
end of my eye it looks more natural to
me if you go
kind of like towards your mouth it's
just going like you have a brown line on
your face and it won't look natural at
all so
now I'm just gonna do the same thing to
the other side just find that hollow in
my face and place my contour shade in
there
I also make some funny faces like when I
suck in my cheek
it just helps kind of really show me
where the hollow is so I can place the
color right in there that's why I make
so many funny faces and again I'm
showing you that I'm stopping at the end
of my eye down on for the forehead and
the temples I just lightly dust this all
my temples and forehead just because I
don't focus too much on it I have a baby
so it pretty much covers up everything
but you know when you've got a big
forehead you kind of do a little bit
then we're gonna do our jawline I just
lightly dust the natural shading of my
jawline but if you want a really
chiseled one place your product right
there really heavily and it'll really
chisel out that jawline for you but
personally I like more than natural wood
so I just followed the natural shading
of my doll
now we're going to take our SPO five
which is just a really great dome shaped
brush and I really love this one to just
kind of blend out any harsh lines you
don't want to get rid of the whole
contour completely just make sure
there's no harsh lines you know you put
your contour there for a reason so don't
blend it out completely just try to make
the lines a little less noticeable and
I'm really lightly doing this by the way
then I'm taking a barium more which is a
great blush from Milani I absolutely
love it for the summer time is just so
gorgeous and I'm taking my FB oh three
brush which was like a really nice
tightly packed to look kind of look and
brush but as I wash it it's gotten
bigger and I'm just smiling a little bit
and I'm placing this on my cheekbones
and taking a little bit up to my temples
sorry about my hair I know I'm probably
driving you guys absolutely bonkers then
I'm taking the mary-lou manizer wishes
does the absolute perfect champagne
highlight and I'm using the FBO one
which is just the perfect fan brush for
the highlight I really really recommend
it make sure you tap off the excess and
I kind of just followed the shape of the
brush so I just kind of roll it up right
on the top of my cheekbones
then I also take it kind of down my nose
and I put some highlight on my Cupid's
bow
and then I take this don't shake brush
one more time kind of blend everything
together make sure there's really no
harsh lines at all and that's pretty
much it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
don't forget to subscribe and I will see
you on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
