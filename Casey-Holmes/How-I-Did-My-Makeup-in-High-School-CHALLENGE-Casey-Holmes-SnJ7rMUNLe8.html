relaxing chit chat kind of video we're
just going to do the high school makeup
challenge and I figured I would do the
high school makeup that I wore right
into freshman year and at the beginning
of sophomore year or like pretty much
almost all of sophomore year I believe
it's pretty interesting
you probably won't expect the makeup
look that I do but this was what I wore
a freshman year when you're trying to
impress people I went through a little
phase so I figured it'd be fun to do
this video as junior year and senior
year came I definitely a wore less
eyeliner and just did things a lot
differently and I'll show you guys
pictures throughout the video because I
think you need pictures to realize that
I'm dead-ass serious about this I went
to CVS and I actually spent $100 on this
stuff can you believe that I know I
didn't spend $100 on this stuff when I
was younger now I first want to say I
don't have like the best memory ever but
I found a picture um from high school
where it was showing my bathroom counter
and I saw a couple different things that
I was like yes I remember that I used
that all the time and then as I was
going to the drugstore I remembered my
eyeliner that I was obsessed with and
lipstick and it just kind of came
together we're just gonna walk through
this together I'm gonna kind of tell you
my experience first off I would just
like to say to my parents if you're
watching this I'm sorry for all the hell
I put you through hoop this was the time
where I was rebelling more like middle
school into high school was like my
rough years and my attitude year so
we're going to start with foundation I
used a foundation I could I swear it was
from Revlon I had a red top it wasn't
the Rimmel one um but it was like the
age-defying
foundation I'm pretty sure it had
different packaging than that I'm pretty
sure it was the old packaging of Revlon
age-defying makeup but I remember using
that foundation so much and I felt like
it made my skin look so good now back in
my
and use primer primer was not a thing
that you use so I just went straight in
with Foundation and also a sponge I had
to buy these sponges that didn't have
any so might there use my hands sponge
whatever but today we're use a sponge
because I'm not a huge fan of using my
hands when I was in middle school we
went through kind of like the phase of
seeing emo ish phase but that's what I
all kind of started that's when like
myspace was popping everybody was on it
but I had all my girlfriends in middle
school we were really close we hung out
all the time but we had a lot of fun
together and then when high school came
around we had to separate and go
different ways I was going to a
different high school and so was my best
friend and my best best best friend at
the time that I was like my best friend
all throughout middle school was going
to the same high school as me which was
really nice and then two of our other
girlfriends had to go to a different
high schools I was really nervous I
wasn't really thrilled with meeting new
people honestly like I had my step group
of friends and I was just kind of like
uh you know I'm not going to hang out
with these people very much whatever and
I will say if you're going into high
school don't think like that definitely
make friends do your thing I made more
friends my junior and senior year than I
did
freshman and sophomore just because I
was more open to it but this makeup was
like the scene makeup and I used to wear
this to work too because I started
working when I was 15 and thus I've been
working ever since I remember one time
wearing this makeup to work and somebody
made fun of me and I literally cried my
eyes out but I still wore it because I
loved it and I was confident I didn't
start not wearing makeup until I started
YouTube and I didn't I always wore
makeup when I went out I never didn't
have makeup on which is so crazy to me
now because I like live off of no makeup
if I'm running errands I'm not gonna put
on makeup I'm going to like I'm not
putting on makeup but it's so crazy to
think that back then I was so
self-conscious and I hated being seen
without this eyeliner on like I needed
my winged liner my nude lipstick to feel
good about myself I also used to use a
concealer stick nothing crazy and I
didn't use anything too light under my
eyes because highlighting and contouring
what's up I'm going to use the shade
medium and this is
stick and I would just under my eyes
like this
I would blend it out and then of course
I would get the same concealer on any
blemishes a little light because it's a
habit now but my concealer was not this
light we used to go to all these punk
rock band was so cool to see everybody's
makeup because people like really took
pride in their makeup seeing people or
whatever I don't know I hate calling
people seeing an emo because I had been
called that when I was younger I
remember wearing like hot pink eyeshadow
we took pride in our winged liner so
even though the makeup was super
excessive for my age
and you know just excessive in general
it's pretty cool that I did all that
because now I feel like winged liner is
so easy because I've done it for so many
years I swear the stick up to school and
people were like okay I swear the most
ugly ass extensions to think I had
colored extensions at one point and I
used to glue extensions in my hair you
guys go get the Sally's extensions and I
would glue them into my hair and I
remember getting that glue off of my
scalp was the most terrible thing and it
was the kind of extensions where you can
obviously tell where your natural hair
ended and then the extensions began you
guys it was so bad um Averett powder
back then with L'Oreal True Match I was
obsessed to this it was amazing unlike
other people that I've watched do this I
was not a huge fan of bronzer bronzer
from what I remember I'd never really
used I just used powder a little bit of
blush if I wanted to but I mainly step
to winged eyeliner and a really nude lip
I don't remember and I used to have
black eye shadow like dark black eye
shadow with glitter was my I don't
even remember what kind of brushes I
used I think for the most part I used
what ever came with all the product and
then for blush I liked the L'Oreal True
Match ones too I just thought the
packaging of these were so cute back in
the day and I love that you could see
the color I'm just gonna pop a little
bit of this on my cheek again I don't
really remember what kind of brushes I
use I'm sure I just used regular
drugstore brushes but just going to put
a little on my cheeks with I did not
have that much color on my face the two
eyeliners
I was in high school and middle school I
used these throughout those years I went
through probably like 30 of these no
while this is the only liquid liner
all day wear water-resistant black liner
I always had liquid liner and even in my
junior and sophomore year I would still
do a really thick line on top and a
thick line on the bottom oh so with my
winged liner I always do super thick
wing I've done wings like this I've done
other wings in some of the pictures you
can't really see because I had that
Donald Trump comb-over please tell me
other people went through that phase
when you had like your bangs starting
like all the way over here so in some of
the pictures you couldn't see but I
always did the inner part of my eye and
the outer corner so the one thing I
loved about this eyeliner in high school
is it is a felt tip but it's a more
stiff felt tip and you have a little bit
more control and you can see how black
it is right there so I'm just going to
show you guys how I do my liner I want
to have it to those makeup off that's
one thing I wish I could remember
then I would take it in the inner corner
and I would do a super thick wing here
too and then after I did that inner
corner part I would go all the way under
my lower lashes and connect it to that
outer wing just like oh my god one of
the biggest struggles too when I was
younger was getting these two inner
corner ones even this makeup people
wouldn't want to talk to you people
thought you were just a weirdo and that
you did like super weird things but
really were just a normal kid that just
had different interests
I liked different music and all that
kind of stuff but people just thought
you were weird kid which I kind of was
weird kid but I wasn't as weird as
people made me out to be nice liner that
I used to love is the covergirl point
plus I remember this liner specifically
because of the packaging loved this for
my waterline it was so black and I love
to that it had a smudger if I wanted to
do like a super smoky eye so if I wanted
to do a really crazy smoky eye what I
would do I would take like a little eye
shadow like this this is a Maybelline
eye shut in like a glittery black I
would put that on my lid and do this
winged eyeliner I remember seeing
pictures of me at school with this and
I'm just like oh my god maybe my wing
wasn't this far out but it was still
super dramatic I never filled in my
eyebrows eyebrows are not a thing for me
I didn't really care the next thing is
ice Kara I mean if you didn't use this
mascara back in the day what were you
doing I remember everybody had this just
because of the packaging okay and then
literally for the last thing that I
would do for my makeup pretty much is
the Revlon nude attitude lipstick this
was such a nude lip and I remember
specifically my stepmom one time I was
at her hair salon and she was like you
know maybe you should go with something
with like a little bit more color
because she can't be me clearly see your
lips and I was like no I love this lip
color is my favorite I would be like I
just hate the color of my lips it's just
gross I don't like having color there No
so this was my all-time of favorite nude
lipstick it was nude attitude there was
another one too I believe
wasn't resist a nudist one yeah it was
the nudist of nude you couldn't see my
lips I didn't line my lips anything and
I went through so many of these as well
oh and every time I saw color my lip
color come through I would put more on
because I hated the color of my lips
like I don't know what it was I just
didn't like it so this is my makeup but
going from middle school into high
school for a couple years and it's crazy
to look back on pictures and see but
definitely what I wore sometimes it was
a little bit different sometimes the
wing wasn't as dramatic but for the most
part this is what it looked like I hope
you guys enjoyed this it was fun to kind
of uh look at myself with this makeup
again it was just funny I mean even
though I had crazy makeup I had a hell
of a good time when I was younger and so
it's just crazy to look back at those
photos and look at my makeup and
recreate it for you guys so I hope you
enjoyed this video if you did don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and I will
see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
