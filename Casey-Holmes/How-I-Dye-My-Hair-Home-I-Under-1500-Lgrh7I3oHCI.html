a very what for the past few days she's
been doing this to me so bad you can be
in the video I promise hey guys so
today's video is going to be a highly
requested video and it is how I dye my
hair at home and I've been doing this
for about a year now it saved me a lot
of money and I haven't damaged my hair
anything you guys have seen my recent
videos you've seen how long it is it's
really healthy it's shiny
so what I've been doing is just been
working for my hair and a lot of you
want to know how I diet what color I use
and everything like that so I first want
to say that I am NOT a hair stylist I
just kind of did this on my own and
figured out what worked for my hair but
um if you have any questions about
developer and stuff like that I would
definitely go to your stylist or ask the
stylist that you might know what their
suggestion is just want to put that out
there in my hair stylist you know this
is just what I do and what obviously
works for my hair and if you have any
other questions or something leave them
in the comments it may be if you're a
stylist or something you could help
answer them I've never used a box dye
like in the like at Walmart or something
because I'm scared to use those one of
the girls that I used to work with she
used a box dye and it completely fried
her hair and she had like little hair
sticking up because it just like broke
it off completely I used these bottle
ones from L'Oreal I always use the
L'Oreal preference line I dyed my hair
probably about every three to four
months you guys see my hair and it's
pretty light and it's like a light red
you guys always ask me what color it is
it's the same color it's just faded
anyways the color that you guys are
seeing on me for the majority of the
year is this L'Oreal preference lush
cherry with a base of violet now when I
dyed my hair this color it does turn out
like a really dark brown it has some red
to it especially when I get out in the
Sun and then it also has that violet
base now when my hair fades it's a
really nice kind of light red Brown and
I really like it that color as well I
love this color all around I loved it
when I first dye my hair I love it when
it fades I think it's great so the lush
cherry base violets one I've been using
but when I just dyed my hair a couple
weeks ago I think it was or like a week
ago
I can't remember
I did mix this with another color I
thought I saved the bottle but I threw
it away so I'm going to try to find it
but it was from there like red line like
the red haired line I think it was like
a Auburn or burgundy or something like
that
and the reason why I mix that with this
one is because I still wanted to keep
the base of violet but I just wanted to
add more red into it because for how
long my hair is I use two bottles of
color and one bottle of a developer
that's enough for my hair and I still
have some left over if I could recommend
one color it definitely the lush cherry
it's amazing these are permanent hair
colors that I'm used a I don't use to
make permanent because I you know I know
what I like so I just get the permanent
so it lasts longer and things like that
I'm going to show you guys clips of me
mixing everything together and dyeing my
hair I usually use a 20 developer but
this time I went with a tin because a
lot of you guys suggested it to me since
my hair is already dark and I should
just go with the tin the tin did work
really really well I did use 20 for the
longest time now I'm gonna start using
the tin since my hair is already dark
I'm just touching up the roots and
touching up the whole color oh yeah you
guys will see when I use here in a
second and then I'll come talk to you
guys after I show you what I've done so
the first thing is to put on some gloves
you want to make sure your hands are
protected from the hair dye I get my
gloves at Sally's as well now I'm taking
the l'oreal preference lush cherry color
and i'm going to pour that into my bowl
that i also got from Sally's and then
take my mega Reds dark intense Auburn
and put this in there and at the end I'm
going to put in my developer which is
the tin and this is a salon care
developer just like the basic one that
they have it's Sally's and what I like
to do is put some can music before I get
started and so I have something to
listen to now I'm going to go ahead and
full warn you this stuff is very very
strong I find myself having to kind of
walk around a couple times because it's
just so intense but what I'm going to do
is just mix this color all together and
make sure you mix it really really well
and then this is what it should look
like
now I've already brushed my hair in
sectioned it how I normally would and
I'm just going to start with my left
side and like I stated in the beginning
I'm going to start with my roots I
always do my roots first and then I will
go and do the rest of the hair so I'm
just going to paint this on take the end
of the brush section off another one and
flip this over and then
those roots as well I repeat this entire
process to my whole head so again I'm
just taking this section its tossing it
over and touching up these roots so
after I'm done with the roots that's
when I start doing the rest of my hair
so I always just like start from the
bottom and work my way up I've
personally found that this is the
easiest way to color your hair and to
make sure all of your hair has the color
on it
you
okay so that's basically how I apply it
my hair I just start with the roots and
then I go down and then after I'm done
with the roots on one side I will then
just do the rest of the hair I had more
clips but they got deleted on accident I
didn't mean to but they did but all I do
is after I've completely coated my hair
I'll take my fingers with the gloves and
I'll just kind of go like this and
massage it just to make sure everything
is nice and covered and then what I'll
do is I'll take a bigger mirror and I'll
look and see the back of my hair and see
if there's any dry spots if I missed
anything and then I'll be good to go and
I just let the color sit for about 20
minutes or so and then I will rinse it
out and I do you shampoo a lot of people
say you're not supposed to use shampoo I
heard you're just supposed to use
conditioner like I don't mind using
shampoo people say it like oh phase the
color automatically or something like
that but I've never experienced a
problem with shampooing my hair I
shampoo it and then I put in a deep
repair mask which is the one I use is
from macadamia and it works great for me
I haven't experienced any problems with
shampooing my hair so yeah that's just
basically what I do and a lot of you ask
me how I get my hair so shiny I do have
a full hair care video I will link it
down below
I still use all of those products my
shampoo and conditioner have changed to
a bumble and bumble shampoo but honestly
I don't see like a huge difference but
everything else is basically the same in
the styling products the tools
everything is still the same so I will
leave that video down below I honestly
don't do anything special other than
argan oil and heat protectant before I
blow dry and I also don't you know wash
it all the time I wash it probably two
times a week keep in mind if you have
any questions about what to use for your
specific hair I would definitely go ask
a stylist and just see what she would
recommend maybe at Sally's or something
so you don't have to go spend like $70
on a hair dye for me for the color
developer I have my bowl that I
continuously use because I wash it out
and my gloves it's about 25 dollars for
me to dye my hair but with if I was just
doing the color it's about 13 dollars so
that's how I save money and
I like it I like dyeing my own hair and
I like kind of mixing colors to see what
I could come up with and so far I really
like this color I'm definitely going to
do it again because when I get on the
Sun you can totally see that it's
definitely more red and it still has
that violet base to it so I really
really love it I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I hope and answer some of
your questions if it didn't and then
just leave them down below and I will
try to get that answered for you and
thank you guys so much for watching
don't forget to like the video if you
liked it and I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
