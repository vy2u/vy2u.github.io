all about what's on my iPhone and how I
edit my Instagram selfies this is one of
the most requested things especially on
my Instagram and I quickly want to
address something because it's very
obvious on my face basically if you
could tell my smile is crooked and that
is because I went to the dentist the
other day to get a cavity fill and you
know when you're gonna dentists and you
have a cavity filled you know you have
to have a shot to know in the area well
basically wherever you put the shot like
in my tooth or in my gum it bruised a
nerve on this side of my face so it's
gonna take a few weeks for it to heal up
it's overly embarrassing I know other
people that don't like me are gonna be
like obsessed with this and obsessed
with the fact that my spell is crooked
what can you do it's one of those things
that can happen when you go to a dentist
or get work done on your teeth and
unfortunately that happened with me this
is just the reason why people are scared
to go to the dentist this is just like
be prime reasons so my smiles gonna be
like this for I don't know how long they
said it takes a few weeks to heal it
could take six weeks it could take four
months it could take something I don't
know um but just bear with me I'm I
don't know of ways to help it heal
faster
I sing I've heard doesn't really make it
heal any faster it's just time because a
nerve takes a long time to literally
heal so I've done my research and I
can't find anything to help out so it's
one of those things that you can't fix
and it's just you got to work through it
if you guys have any tips if you've ever
had a prisoner we let me know how you
handle it how you deal with it because
I've never had one before this is very
new to me I don't know if you can hear
the sickness and my voice but I have
this disgusting coal that is going
around and no this video is just I'm
just a hot mess in this video my smiles
cricket I'm sick as a dog I have like
sinus congestion stuff going on I'm just
a mess spend anyways onto the
you guys are wondering my phone case is
from tiny Los Angeles I've mentioned her
before she's not sponsoring the video
whatsoever but I just love this case and
I think it's so cute and if you have a
black iPhone it's just super sleek I
also could like one to say I don't have
a ton of ass on my iPhone just because I
get a little like it gives me anxiety to
have a lot of apps on my phone like I
cannot handle it it's just it drives me
nuts I don't know how people have three
pages of apps because I have to have one
page of apps if I have any more than
that I will go insane I'm going to show
you guys want to have known hopefully
you liked it the main reason I wanted to
this video was just to show you guys how
I edit my Instagram selfies just so you
can see you know different apps and
maybe you can try to edit them that way
too there's kind of like a certain
pattern that I use for my selfies to
kind of keep it along a theme so you'll
see that in the video though but thank
you guys for watching and let's go ahead
and jump on into the video okay so this
is my home screen of my iPhone now like
I told you guys in the beginning I don't
have extra pages because that kind of
stuff drives me insane so I have one
page where I see all of my apps I like
to be able to see everything to see the
apps I need to use whatever whatever so
of course you have the camera and then
we have Twitter here and let's see who's
on here do you see your name anybody see
your name so this is my Twitter I'll
leave a link for it down below so you
guys can check it out as well as my
Instagram and those are my little baby
bees right there if you don't know I
have two dolls and I love them yeah this
one is my Instagram I'll leave these
down below look at Kim look at gorgeous
oh just okay anyway then we have of
course photos luke music weather notes
actually use notes a lot I didn't expect
to use notes as much as I do but I use
it literally all the time then we have
finance which finance is more of a
personal section so I'm not going to
show you that but what's really funny
about finance is I have the Domino's app
and Fitness Pal right by each other like
it's so ridiculous
and then we have navigation so this is
where I keep the apps that the iPhone
comes with which I really don't like
them I wish apple will give you the
opportunity to delete them like the
newsstand no passbook no game center
like I don't want any of these apps but
you can't delete them so I just put them
all in this little folder so they can
all hang out or whatever and I also keep
my iTunes and App Store over here and I
top which is just a voice recorder and
that's what I used to use to do my
voiceovers but not anymore then we have
photography which will get INSAT in just
a moment we have the hunt calculator
SoundCloud Safari Facebook Pinterest
which I love Pinterest it's one of my
guilty pleasures so let's see what's
going on on Pinterest look at that
freaking fridge hello I'm gonna pin that
to my future house cuz you never know
but yeah I love Pinterest I'll just sit
here at night for powers I just I can't
deal with it so I'll leave all my links
down below then we have Poshmark
messenger which is like the app you have
to have if you want messages from people
on Facebook it's really stupid but
whatever and then we have Pandora
snapchat and Yahoo Mail now my snapchat
is a personal snapchat is not a public
snapchat I've had a lot of people ask me
about that I don't have a public one to
give out to you guys this was just for
friends and family so I'm sorry about
that but maybe one day I'll create a
public one if you want me to do that and
leave a comment in the comment box but
for now I just have one for family and
friends and it's just personal so I
don't give that out to everybody so
moving on to the photography folder this
has a ton of different apps so this
folder I have Reap X pic frame wood
camera reflection photo toaster pic lab
square ready vsco cam cream cam rookie
pic gram free pic lane and photo wizard
there's only about 4 apps that I
actually use in this so first off the
one that I use all the time is rookie
and this is the one I've been using for
quite some time now and I really really
really like it
so I'm going to show you guys how I edit
a selfie so what I'm going to so I'm
going to show you guys how I add my
selfies I'm going to take this photo
right here which you can see the colors
kind of off it's super bright I need to
edit it to have more color so as you can
see the colors that's off it's very ashy
and very very bright just overexposed so
we're gonna fix that first thing I like
to do if my color if my picture is not
overexposed like if there's not a lot of
brightness what I'll do like normally
when I'm doing a outfit of the night
post the first thing I will do is I will
go to warm light which is right here and
then I'll take Shearwood which is the
first the second one in the thing and it
just really brightens up the photo so
I'm doing an outfit of the night post I
have to use this because most of time is
dark in my room and you can't see the
outfit so this actually helps a lot and
you can see how there's like little dots
on here I'll take this and just tone it
down so the light link is gone and then
this one you can adjust so you have a
little bit Orla and usually I do about
that much when the picture is dark but
for this photo we're not using that so
going back to the color wheel we're
gonna go ahead and go into mellow moody
this is another thing that I use all the
time on my photos it's just every time I
post a photo I use this one it's called
breezy and this one also has a texture
to it so you just want to click it again
and then take the texture and turn that
off and then this one it just kind of
depends on what I'm feeling you can see
it goes a little bit darker a little bit
lighter whatever so I usually take mine
about 1/2 way like that just adds a
little bit more color and then I like to
go to this part right here and then
slide over here to the vibrance area and
I will adjust this so that the photo has
more color and I love this one usually I
use a lot because my lights tend to wash
everything out so I put it up pretty
high just though you can see the true
color of everything like my hair and my
lips and I don't look like a white ghost
so we're just gonna go ahead and check
that one off and then that's pretty much
where I stopped the only two that I use
most is the one in warm light which is
Shearwood and then I'll go in and use
the mellow moody breezy so those are the
two I used most often and it's a very
very rare that I switch it up so it kind
of also keeps a pattern to my photos the
color at least if you go on my Instagram
and look at my feed you'll know what I'm
talking about so we're gonna go ahead
and save this to camera roll and it
shows you the before and then after it's
really cool and then we're going to go
ahead and exit out of that and then if I
need to use it I will but this one's
cream cam I don't use this too too often
but if I need to I will so I'll just
upload the photo to it and this make
sure you look really airbrushed
and kind of fakin away it just softens
the picture sometimes people overdo this
it looks too done but what I like to do
is I take mine to about 20% if I'm going
to use it that way it just kind of
smoothes out the photo and it's not too
drastic and you can still see like the
strands of my hair my contour you know
the things you want to see so I don't
take my too far I usually go to about 20
or less but we're not going to use that
because we don't need it today no but if
you don't want to use it you would just
click this stay photo and then it would
be done but after I edit that one photo
we're going to go into square ready and
square Reddy's an app where you can
adjust the size so that the whole photo
fit on an Instagram so we're just going
to tap in the photo like this and you
can see that it doesn't fit right now
but you can go to this little guy right
here that has two arrows you can just
click this and it automatically adjust
the picture into the box for you so that
this whole thing shows up on Instagram
sometimes I like to take it in just a
little bit more to have a little bit
more of a white border but it just
depends on how I'm feeling for the day
most of the time I'll just leave it like
this so you can see the whole photo
really nicely and then after you do that
just go ahead and save it to your camera
roll and then it's time to upload it to
Instagram so I'll go in here she is
girl look at her she posted so many damn
fun
so we're going in here uploading the
photo now one thing I do like to do
sometimes if I feel like the photo
doesn't have enough color for me or
enough warmth I'll go into the tool
section and go to warmth and kind of
adjust it a little bit so it's a little
bit warmer I like my photos to be more
on the warm side and cool I used to have
photos that were very very cool but now
I try to do more than warm side just
because it shows the colors and
everything a lot better so usually I'll
click that and then click Next and of
course right in the caption tag my
outfit and then post it to Twitter or
whatever if you're ever wondering what
top I'm wearing more than likely I will
have tagged it in the photo
so all you gotta do is tap the photo
I'll show you right here so like in this
one I posted today a lot of people ask
where I get certain things most all you
gotta do is just tap the photo and it
will tell you where everything is from I
try to do that every single time if I
don't I forget but for the most part I
tag pretty much everything so if you are
wondering I do that as well but that's
basically how I edit my selfies it's
really really easy I don't do anything
too dramatic
I'll leave my favorite apps like I said
down below so you guys can check them
out I can basically delete all of these
like I really don't need them but pic
frame this one I used to use all the
time if I wanted a side-by-side photo so
I never used like these other ones for
anything but I would take this one right
here I would go to style and take the
border off and then I would click
whatever picture I wanted in here so
like this one and then click this one as
well but to kind of change it up a
little bit you could tap the picture and
hit the rotate mirror part and you could
do like a mirror or something and have
it look like that like double the
trouble right there make it look cool or
you could just twist it around like that
which is what I used to do all the time
so I could do like a close-up on my
makeup and then have the full picture on
the other side just depends on whatever
you want to do it's just fun to play
around with these things and just kind
of you know see what you can do I think
this one has filters too but the effects
aren't that great so you can see
they're just a little too much like you
can't adjust these they're just a little
too much so yep that's basically how I
edit everything and what's on my iPhone
let me know what your favorite app is
for pictures down below in the comments
I don't think I'll switch mine up but I
always love looking at different ones so
