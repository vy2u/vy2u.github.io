announced probably in the next video or
video after ok thank you guys for
watching I'm gonna shut up now so we can
get started
bye guys okay so you can see my eyebrows
have like a little bit Foundation and
stuff in them that's gonna be okay
because it'll be covered up now if I was
just doing in my regular brow routine
like not wanting to spend too much time
on it I would take this Tarte Amazonian
clay brow mousse and taupe and I would
just fill them in how they are shaped
now I wouldn't like over draw them I'm
gonna show you guys how I groom them and
how I do my bolder brow because I've
recently gone back to it and I just have
been loving having a bolder brow so
first off my favorite tweezers are from
Anastacio I love these the black ones
came in a kit and the pink ones I
purchased by themselves so what I'm
gonna do
I'm just going to tweeze any excess hair
and with foundation on it is kind of
hard to you know tweeze the hairs
because sometimes you can't see
especially if you put some concealer on
your eyelid so definitely do it without
foundation align if you can't tell but I
can usually see some of them because I
have really dark hairs so I'm going to
be using this brush from Anasazi up
again this came in a kit it's just a
spoolie and brush duo and then I'm going
to using these scissors and what I like
to do is I'll just kind of comb through
them first
and then I just push up the hairs like
so and you will start to see which hairs
are like super super long you see that
right there I will just start trimming
you don't want to get too out of hand
with it because you don't want to be
left or like nowhere else but just trim
any really long hairs my hairs are
usually longer at the ends so that's
what I will be trimming today so just
like that like I said you don't want
your too crazy with it but just trim any
hairs that are just way too long
so I'm just gonna take my powder brush
brush away any of those hairs I know
I've talked about these Anasazi up brow
Wiz pencils before and I'm kind of like
a hit miss with them I love them but
then again I think they do pull out my
brow hairs so I don't use them every
single day I just use them when I want
to bolder brow which is usually when I'm
filming or going out anything like that
the two colors I like to use are medium
ash and brunette again these do have the
pencil side and then they also have a
spoolie on the end this one I lost the
caps too but that's just it look like
we'll also be using today is this
Armistice hacia brow powder this is a
medium brown and this came in a kit as
well here to kit with like all the other
stuff I just showed you guys but these
are the colors in this little palette
so the first one we're going to take is
brunette I like to use this one to fill
out the outer half of my brow so just
place them where I want them to go arch
is kind of missing over here that is
where this hair will not grow back but
I'm going to start filling that part in
with the brunette shade and kind of drag
up to my natural arch and then also draw
a little bit down towards the tail
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to kind of fill in right
where those hairs are starting to grow
in I just start filling that part in
very very lightly you don't have to use
a hard heavy hand with this and as I go
along I just like to brush it out so
it's not super harsh just like that okay
and that's how much I fill in with the
brunette shade now what I'll do is I'll
go in with the medium ash I start
filling in the rest of this brow and
since I'm using a lighter shade it's not
going to be as harsh and again just
using a really light hand I like to stop
about right here
just so I'll fill in the rest with
powder so it's not like super noticeable
drawn on eyebrows and then I also go
underneath here and outline that brow
and I take that all the way in and I
kind of fill in right there as well so
that's just what that looks like I'm
gonna brush through and it looks really
sparse right now because we're gonna go
back in with powder and fill the rest of
it in but I like to use the Anasazi a
brow is is to really outline everything
and give me a good shape now going in
with this powder I'm going to take the
darker shade found it why use the pencil
just then I'm going to take the brush
and I'm gonna go in that darker shade
and then we're gonna fill in the outer
part of this brow just to make sure it's
nice and filled in and we don't have any
crazy hairs going on just like that
very soft short strokes and you can see
the difference right there even though I
have that one area that's just being
stubborn and it doesn't have to be all
the way filled in because then it can
look a little too much but that's pretty
much what I do right there and like on
camera you're still closed up you're
like I see sparse hairs
well yeah but like out back here you
wouldn't even tell you know what I mean
so now I'm going to go in with the
lighter shade and this little duo and
this is when you want to be really light
handed and careful because you don't
want it to be too much in the front so
I'm just going to lightly feather this
and the front of my brow and then I
start down here and I kind of flick it
up
just like so
and I also kind of try to blend that
line upwards as well and have some
people that might look super drawn in
and crazy but to me it looks fine
especially when you're just looking at
me like look at look at the difference
in that art right there I'm going to do
those same exact steps on my other
eyebrow and I'll be right back to show
you guys how I set them okay so I went
ahead and did the rest and my face
makeup so you can see how the brows look
when you have a full face of makeup on
it just looks 10 times better whenever
you have a nice fuller brow to go with
everything else that's going on with the
dramatic lips and the really winged
eyeliner
it just looks all it just all fits
together so if you want to you can
totally take concealer and carve out
your brows to do a little bit more of a
dramatic look as well I don't always
carve out my brows unless I like mess up
or something so the last thing I do for
my brows like to set them in place is I
use this anastacio brow gel this is in
the color brunette I love this color
because whenever you put it over top of
what you've already done it kind of
makes everything look a little bit more
natural and I've been using this for a
while and the first time I got this I
thought it was going to be darker and I
got in male nose like oh my gosh this is
like a golden brown but it's up working
out really really well and it just makes
your brows look a little bit more
natural and also holds all of those
crazy hairs down so that's that one done
but yeah so now I'm going to do the
other one and the last a final step I'm
going to do is highlight underneath my
brow bone and I'm going to be taking the
color shroom by Mac highlighting
underneath the brow bones really gonna
help lift it as well so this is shroom
right here actually just got this
recently shown in my last haul and I'm
going to place this right underneath the
arch that's where I want to focus most
of my color and then I just kind of
blend the rest of it out underneath of
my brow like I said I just want to focus
most of that color underneath the brow
right there at the arch and then drag
the rest of the color out but that is
basic
everything I really loved the boulder
browse like I said I definitely
recommend using the Anasazi Oh
brow Wiz is sparingly because my breath
is so much fuller after I quit using
these I just felt like it kind of pulled
out some of my hairs but if you want to
use it every day just be careful use a
really light hand with it and you should
be good to go
I definitely think they're great
products though so yeah I hope you guys
enjoy to this video again this is just
what I do if you don't like the bolder
brows then you obviously don't have to
follow this routine then I have so thank
you guys so much for watching and I will
see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
