you how I fill in my brows I thought it
would show you guys what I've been doing
lately I've had a lot of questions so I
figured I'd do a video for you and if
you're wondering when I'm wearing on my
face makeup wise I will put everything
down below it's been kind of what I've
been using lately in my last now 3
videos I've been using this makeup look
it's kind of like my go-to right now if
you're interested then go check that out
otherwise I hope you enjoyed this video
and if you don't like bolder brows you
might not like this but I've been loving
the bolder brow
I think big brows are beautiful so
that's why I feel line in and it also
took me a while to kind of figure out
how to do my brows I'm still constantly
learning everyday so if you're not great
at it right away
you know don't be nervous about it just
keep practicing that's what it's about
and I think the concealer really helps a
lot with achieving really nice brows so
definitely recommend that and using
concealer just to clean it up and yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this video and I
will see you in my next one
hi ok so we're gonna be using the brow
bar to go today and we're going to use
the darkest shade in this palette and
also using the Sigma e 15 brush I love
this one for my brows I'm gonna do is
just go ahead and brush through my brows
with a spoolie brush you can find these
anywhere for super cheap and then we're
gonna start creating our arch as you can
tell I don't really have an arch to my
eyebrow so I like to create that with
brow products so I'm also going to
extend the tail of my eyebrow just a
little bit you don't have to do that if
you don't want to and don't worry I know
it looks a little bit messy but we'll
clean it up here in a second and now I'm
going to the beginning of my brow and
kind of lining underneath there and
blending it upwards to you know fill in
those sparse hairs because I barely have
any hairs at the beginning of my brow
and then I'm just going to take that
line and extend it out to the end of my
brow and just start filling it in okay
so now what I'm doing is filling in the
top of my brow and I'm also connecting
it to the arch that I had created in the
beginning just so I can get a nice sort
of rounded effect and it really helps
make my brows look a lot more fuller
than they actually are so I'm just
filling them in and then going through
my brow and filling in little spaces
that didn't have a lot of hair
or just look like they didn't have
enough brow product on there to blend in
with everything else now I'm going to
use am I in 25 or MW 25 concealer from
this matte palette I do believe that's
the color and I'm just going to start
shaping my brows even more it with this
concealer and you'll be amazed at how
much the concealer blends everything and
makes it look a lot more clean and just
looks so much more put together so
concealers like your best friend with
this I definitely recommend it if you're
just trying out with brows because if
you mess up it's super easy to clean it
up this way so I'm just lining
underneath my brow and blending it
downwards just to make the line look a
lot more sharp and then also doing the
same thing with the top of my brow and
also by doing this you can kind of
adjust your arch if you don't want
really mean brows which a lot of us
don't want you can use concealer to help
fix it and make the top part of your
brow look just a little bit more rounded
but you'll still have that arch that you
wanted so a lot of people do this before
their foundation but personally I think
the concealer blends into my skin really
nicely so I always do this after
foundation I've never done it before
because I just think that's too much to
work with so do whatever you prefer and
now I'm gonna comb through my brows just
to make sure everything's nice and
blended and then go back through is
concealer if needed so this is pretty
much what our brows are going to look
like now I'm just setting them in place
with the wax that comes in the kit and
I'm gonna apply that over my brows and
then take my spoolie and brush through
them just to make sure there's no wax
clumps or anything like that and they
look nice and smoothed out and then you
are done with your brows keep in mind
this does take a little bit to get used
to if you've never done your brows
before but you'll eventually get it I
promise if you're having a hard time
finding our arch you can angle your
brush from your nose up and you can see
where my arch is right there you can
also take your brush right beside your
nose like this and this is where you
should begin your brow and then angle it
out from your nose and that's where you
end your brows so if you having a hard
time you can definitely try that trick
and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching
don't forget to like it and I will see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
