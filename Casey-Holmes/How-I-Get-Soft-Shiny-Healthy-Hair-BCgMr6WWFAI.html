updated hair care routine because ever
since I dyed my hair darker I've had a
ton of questions on how I keep it nice
and shiny and smooth and just really
healthy so I'm going to show you guys
the products I've been using since I
went brunette and I love each and every
one of these products some of them I had
I did use when I was blonde but I still
continue to use now that I'm a brunette
because they're just amazing first off
is shampoo and conditioner I'm very
picky about my shampoo and conditioner
it's really hard to find one that
doesn't dry out my hair
so recently I've actually got these and
I really love them I got these at
t.j.maxx they're the joy Co moisture
recoveries got the shampoo so it just
looks like this is joy Co then I got a
little size of the conditioner and just
looked like this I really love these
products because they really make my
hair super super soft and shiny like I
love them I tried another joy joy Co
product I can't remember exactly what
it's called but I'll put it right here
and I didn't really like it it actually
dried out my hair a lot but these have
been really really awesome I love the
shampoo and conditioner they've been my
favorite so far so that's what I use
pretty much every time I wash my hair
another brand that I love that strug
store is the clear line I have talked
about this for a long time and I still
really love these products so the clear
hair scalp and therapy damaged color
repair shampoo and conditioner those are
my favorites I don't like the shea
butter ones I've tried it it way down my
hair it smelt like play-doh it was
disgusting
so I love the damage and color repair
kind is just really awesome and it
leaves my hair super super soft as well
so if you're looking for more of an
affordable shampoo conditioner I
definitely recommend these now only use
one mask for my hair and I purchased
this a while back and at first I was
blonde when I tried this out and I
didn't like it for some reason I felt
like it wasn't exactly what everyone
hyped it up to be but now I'm obsessed
with it I don't know if it's the color
change or what but I actually put this
all over my hair my bangs and everything
because usually I'll just put
conditioner from here down but I will
put this
masks all over and it's the macadamia
natural oil deep repair mask this has
been talked about on YouTube since I
don't even know like forever and it's
really amazing I'm almost out of it I've
used so much of this stuff I don't use
it every time I wash my hair I actually
only wash my hair probably about every
at least every other day I'll wait but
I'll usually wait every two days or
three days sometimes but this I'll use
probably twice a week and it really just
replenishes my hair makes it feel so
soft I just used it today and it's like
ah I love it
and it does smell so so good it is $30
but this little thing has lasted me for
a few months now so I think I'll
definitely repurchase this I'm debating
on whether I shall be purchased this or
just try the Moroccan oil one I'm
thinking of trying that one out but I
really really have been enjoying this a
lot okay so those are things that I use
in the shower now when I get out I still
use this healthy sexy hair soy try wait
leave-in conditioner and bow down to
here on this baby I absolutely love this
I'll just spray this in my hair before I
wide toothed comb it it just makes it
really soft smell good and it just makes
my hair really nice and shiny so I love
this it's a leave-in conditioner and I
do use this every time I get out of the
shower so I use this product in
conjunction with this one so this is an
oil I've had this for a while if you
guys watched some previous videos I
mentioned the new me pure remedy oil I
think was yes it was in the orange
bottle but I loved this one a lot better
I think this one is so amazing it's the
organics by Noomi argan oil and this is
so good I can't even tell you guys this
is what looks like it's a huge huge
bottle I don't even use um probably I
use like a little bit less than a dime
sized amount because my hair can get
really oily really quickly so I don't
want to put like too much oil in my hair
and weigh it down and make it look
really greasy but I love this product I
also have a coupon code down below for
this I think you can get it for $20
which is insane because I'm pretty sure
it's like 50 or something like that so
if you're interested in getting this for
20 bucks I would definitely check the
coupon code down below you guys know
they always like give you guys coupon
codes all the time
and I really enjoy that and I appreciate
it as well because I mean $50 for Doyle
is very expensive but getting this for
only $20 is insane
but this makes my ends so smooth let me
tell you when I go in the shower and I
use this mask and then when I get out
and I use this in my hair in this oh my
gosh so smooth so like silky and pretty
and it's never frizzy at all next just
to talk about heat protectant I use the
Nexus Pro mint heat protectant it just
looks like this nothing too crazy but if
I'm going to straighten or curl my hair
this is obviously what I'll use and it
works I mean I don't notice a huge
difference between heat protectors I
know one that I don't like though is the
Tresemme one because they actually like
me my hair dry and I didn't really like
that this one's really great and you
know you should always have a heat
protectant whenever you're styling your
hair with hot tools so I really like
this one and the last product I have is
a dry shampoo because I don't you know
wash my hair every day that really helps
keep your hair nice and shiny and
healthy if you don't wash it every day
because if you continue to wash it you
know you're just going to dry out your
hair and it's just not going to be good
in the end
so the dry shampoo that I love is of
course the batiste dry shampoo and this
one is the a hint of color deep and dark
brown you can get this at Ulta for I
think like eight or nine bucks it's
amazing I always stock up on these
things I could not go days without
washing my hair if it wasn't for this
dry shampoo I love it so much and
especially if you have darker hair I
totally totally recommend this okay so
those are all the products that I use to
keep my hair nice and shiny and healthy
I love them all so much and they really
have been working so amazingly for my
hair and now that we are at the end of
the video I do have a surprise giveaway
