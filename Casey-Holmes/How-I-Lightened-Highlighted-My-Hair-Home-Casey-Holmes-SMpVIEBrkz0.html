feel like I should be a vampire right
now kosha was probably Robbie for
Halloween is your vampire just doesn't
want the fangs I want to be like all
right let's try see how this looks
that's how we got a creeper over here
hi creep creep tip toe in my John hey
guys so today's video is going to be all
about how I highlighted my hair I really
quickly want to say this isn't that a
tutorial because I have not highlighted
my hair after the first time I've done
it I'm giving my hair a break and I
currently love the color that it is rat
me out so I have not highlighted it but
I'm going to try my best to talk you
through this and just let you know how I
use the products that I have also Louis
sexy little middle finger right here
this is a finger that I messed up um
area Daisy
messed up it's still healing it looks
absolutely disgusting if you look it up
close so I'm going to make sure I don't
show you up close I did have acrylic and
then a gel like gel acrylic I don't know
what they call this stuff the gel polish
on top so that color is still there
because they are not going anywhere in
my hand with a little salt thing I'll
know what you call that thing letting it
breathe its Bajada bainite on it for
quite some time so I'm just letting it
have a break and it's just looking
ratchet today so this is how we're
working it okay so anyways like I said
today I'm gonna tell you guys how I dyed
my hair with this kit this is the Revlon
frost and glow highlighting kit I picked
mine up from Walgreens I've purchased
probably two of them this is a honey
highlighting kit for medium to dark
around hair they also have one for if
you have more blonde hair so they have
two different kits you just have to read
it right here on the top now it does
have like a color chart on the back
right here as you can see I don't think
mine turned out the same exact color
that it says mine are a little bit more
brassy which I like them it's kind of
like a brassy caramel shade
I would say which I like the way mine
turned out but I think if you tone it
and stuff it would turn out to these
colors but like I said this just is like
a color chart to kind of give you an
idea on how your highlights are going to
look so this kit ranges I believe from
about 8 to 15 dollars I can remember off
to top my head I believe in Walgreens it
was like 10 and you can get this at
Walgreens CVS Walmart Target anybody
that carries Revlon and like hair kits
they will happen so let's just show you
what you get inside first off you get
this little thing right here you get
this a little kind of bowl thing where
you're going to mix the developer in the
bleach you get this which this has the
cap you know on like old-school ways I
remember I used to my hair highlighted
this way the high hair cells with the
cap on and they would pull the strands
through and highlight them that way you
could do that if you wanted to it also
has a mixing little guy in here but I
don't use this I have my own mixing bowl
and brush and I definitely don't use the
Kapiti more because that stuffy Hollies
that I want so if you did want more if
we did want more of the highlights like
this that kind of looked like that then
you would use the cap in here you also
get the Revlon frost and glow cream
developer that's what it looks like
probably hard to see because it's super
white you also get the after
highlighting the moisturizing
conditioner and shampoo which I don't
use these but they're there for you to
use if you want to use them I do highly
recommend them and then you also get the
Revlon frosted glow highlight
highlighting powder which is basically
yell bleach a little packet now if your
hair stylist I know you're watching this
video going oh hell no this girl is not
telling these young girls women you know
whoever is watching my videos to
highlight their hair with this kit I
understand I know stylists hate these
kids because they're bad for your hair I
know
I know I know I know but honestly you
know what some people just can't afford
to go to the salon and hell
I didn't want to go spend 100 bucks at
the salon to get my hair highlighted
let's just go ahead and get the
disclaimers over with right now use this
box at your own risk
bleach is a seriously serious chemical
seriously serious I don't want you to
ruin your hair so if you are not
comfortable don't think you can even do
it for a second don't do this like it's
just it's not worth it I did use it on
my hair and I loved it you will notice
your hair be a little more dry and you
can have some breakage and you know what
that's just what happens when you get
highlights I mean even when I got my
hair professionally highlighted and
professionally on grade my hair was
super super super damaged especially
after my last ombre whoa girl I had that
back in about February and my hair was
so damaged and it's just because there
was so much bleach on the hair so again
don't do this if you're not completely
comfortable don't think your hair's
gonna turn out good just don't do it I
would hate for you to wear in your hair
and then you told me that you ruined it
and I just feel so bad so just putting
that out there right now don't do it if
you don't think you can do it and if you
don't think it's gonna look good let's
just get started and start talking about
this so I can hopefully explain it
pretty easily for you I like I said I
don't I did not use this little guy
because first off it's like super tiny
but I already had this since I did dye
my hair you know I've been dyeing my
hair for a while now and I got this bowl
and this brush from Sally's they're
super dirty because they're super dirty
okay this at Sally's and I think they're
really really affordable I can't
remember the price cuz it's been so long
but I also like this brush because then
you can section off your hair super
easily with the end of this and it's
just easy to do so all you do is you
take the powder put it in the bowl the
developer put in the bowl mix it all
together make sure it's nice and mixed
up it should have more of a creamy
consistency not too thick not too watery
after a while it does start to kind of
get a little bit thicker but when you're
first starting out you need to make sure
it's a nice cream
texture don't you have it all mixed up
you're ready to highlight your hair this
is kind of the art aspect of this and I
see it as art because you get to place
this wherever you want like your
highlights you determine where you want
so make sure your hair is sectioned off
how you part it every single day or how
you're mainly been apart it what I did
is my first section was right here above
my ear so I pulled this up and out of my
face so I worked with the bottom section
first I would take foil and wrap it up
just like the hairdresser's do where
they rip up the foil they were like
little long strips and I would just wrap
it around the hair and then toss it back
and let it sit there so this is like the
first section that I had right and you
could see right here where I started
highlighting so some of them are down
here I drug some of them up you know I
just I didn't have a set pattern to them
so basically what I would do is I would
take like a strand like this so I would
either take the hair and drag some
bleach down in like this and change the
heights of them or what I would do is I
would take a piece like this and I would
highlight that hair and I would take
this whole strand and highlight it and
of course brush some of it up to blend
with the darker roots and then saturate
the bottoms and then put it in an
aluminum foil so I had two different
techniques when joining my hair it was
not the same technique whatsoever it
will probably never be the same
technique so I would either like I said
I would either brush it along like this
or take a piece of hair and completely
highlight this one and just blend it up
towards the roots some highlights can
start way down here some start way up
here you just want to alternate those
heights just so it all blends and fades
really nicely and you can see like I
didn't highlight every single hair
whatsoever so like say I did the brush
technique right here where I did two or
three four strikes however much I wanted
and then I wrap it up in aluminum foil
toss it back and then I would take
probably about this much hair toss that
back with it and then highlight again so
I did not hide
every single strand of hair because then
it would just bend to alright for me
when I wanted more of that highlighted
effect so keep that in mind as well now
I did that all the way until I got to
the very top which my last top layer
it's always like this is usually this
section right here so everything from
here down is usually good to go and
highlight it so when I got to this top
section of course I did not want to put
a lot of highlights in the top of my
hair because I want that to be the
darkest part I want all of this to be
the darkest part of my hair and fade
down into a lighter brown or brassy kind
of blonde so when you get to this point
you definitely want to make sure that
your hair is part of however you would
want it parted how everywhere every day
however you wear it most days that's how
you want to put your hair when you're
doing this so when I got to at this very
top section the only thing I wanted to
do was add in most of my highlights
right here like if I was going to add
highlights it was going to be right in
this area just to really frame the face
and kind of warm up my complexion of it
so what I did I would take this brush
kind of section off my bangs like so
then brush it out you definitely wanna
make sure your hair is nice and tangle
free when you're doing all of this
whenever you're dyeing your hair in
general you want to make sure your hair
is completely tangle free and then what
I did is I put most of the highlights
right here so you can see this one
strand right here where there's a
highlight I just lightly took my brush
and went like this and again kind of
faded it up a little bit just brushing
it up and down like that just so it
wasn't a harsh line and then for the
rest of it I just took my brush what
would hey hey hey you're breathing funny
you can't that scares mommy you can't
breathe
okay so with my bangs I just sectioned
it off like this top I cannot handle the
next you guys I can so with this top
section what I did was I was section off
my hair like this and then you can see
one of the highlights right here I
really highlighted this one part and
then of course it brushed it up like
that then for the rest of it I just took
my brush and I went like this that's all
I did I just brushed a little bit like
so and then of course saturated some of
the ends of this hair down here I did a
little bit more than I wanted to but I
kind of just got lazy because I was
really over dyeing my hair so I just
kind of brushed it like so and I was
good to go and then when I wanted a
highlight like I didn't probably like
two or three four like back here I would
just pick a strand and put some bleach
on my finger and run it through it and
kind of brush it like this at the very
top and this one doesn't have barely any
product on it but I would take a section
like this maybe even a little bit
smaller and I would take some bleach on
my finger and go like this and run it
down my hair and then would also kind of
brushed up like that again just to help
it blend so I did that on that side and
of course the same went for this side I
of course wanted some of the lighter
part around my face so you can see the
highlight that I did right here I just
included one there and then I also again
just kind of dragged the brush like so
now for me my hair takes a while to lift
like the bleach is just oh my gosh when
I used to be super super blonde in the
beginning of my channel I would have to
get my hair done every like three weeks
I think it was like it was so bad
because my hair was this dark I was like
bleach blonde on top so my roots were
horrible and I would literally be in the
salon for hours because it takes my hair
so long to lift like to get blonde it
just takes forever so for me I waited
about 20-25 minutes for this color right
here and you can see it's not super
super blonde it's more brassy than
anything which I like the color some
people don't like that look but you can
always just tone it and I'll be fine
no that takes my hair such a long time
to lighten up that's why I just I wait
for a while I wait about 20-25 minutes
and then I got scared and then I took it
out because I didn't want to fry my hair
so also keep in mind whenever you have
your hair in the foil it is wet so it's
going to look darker than it actually is
it should be about a few shade it should
be a couple shades lighter than how it
looks in the foil which I definitely
notice that because I would be like wow
my hair looks super dark but once I blow
dried it and washed everything out it
was nice and light so just keep that in
mind it looks darker in the foil than it
looks
when you wash it all out and blow-dry it
because your hair obviously looks darker
when it's wet just keep that in mind and
if you don't know like if you know how
your hair is with bleach that would
really help you with this kit because
you know how long to do you know if you
should do it or not out if you've never
done bleach before I say go to a salon
because you have no idea how much time
you need a wait
and you're just kind of nervous I know I
would be I was just kind of like hey if
I'm going to set up I'm just gonna dye
it all brown again and I just ended up
loving it and I wasn't dating my haircut
before I put the highlighting stuff in
but then I was like oh I'm too impatient
so I went ahead and highlighted it and
then the next day I did go get a haircut
so the ends were just a tad a bit
lighter but I liked it I got probably
about an inch cut off but I like the way
that it looks now it's not too um bright
esque it's more sunkissed that's what I
wanted the more sunkissed look where the
hair was just a little bit lighter so
that is how I did my hair I really hope
you guys enjoy it like I said I don't
touch the brown in my hair anymore I
haven't touched it for a few months I
think I did was put this highlighting
kit in the ends of some of my hair and
it just lightened up the look I just I
love it because it makes me look like so
warm and inviting
that sounds really awkward and weird but
I just feel so much like summer aid
especially if I have a tan and I love
this color and a lot of you really been
loving it too so thank you so much for
all this week comment I'm actually
waiting for belamis ombre extensions to
come out because I did try
diamon but the color was just not
happening for me so so I'm ready to get

whenever I do wash my hair out I use my
regular shampoo that is a moisturizing
shampoo and then I also use my macadamia
and deeper pear mask and I leave that on
