be a different kind of video now I know
I normally do get ready with me videos
and they're really you know you don't
get ready with me videos and they're
just not how you really get ready
sometimes I mean it really is how you
ready sometimes I'm you know you sit
down do your makeup whatever which is
what most you guys see if you see my
last two get ready with me video it was
kind of different it was a watch me get
ready so you have to see from like start
to finish and this one's another kind of
get ready with me but it's different
when my friends is being featured in it
and it's just showing you guys what we
literally do on girls night like all we
do is just laugh and have a good time
and I just I don't know I wanted to show
you guys this it's a little bit
different but also it's a little more
personal you're getting a little bit
more into my life you're going to see
some bloopers at the end that are really
funny and it's just like how we are it's
just so funny so this isn't going to be
showing you guys full-on makeup hair
glam I will show you guys the outfits at
the end of the video my camera actually
ended up dying because I was filming so
much throughout the day and I was
filming long clips so I forgot to like
turn off but I'm sorry about that we
didn't get to film like the whole
outfits but I will have pictures for you
guys at the end of what we wore and I
think you guys will just really like it
yeah I hope you guys enjoy it I've been
talking long enough I love you thank you
so much for watching don't forget to
subscribe and check out my last video I
did which will be linked in the
description box below and I hope you
guys have had an amazing weekend and
I'll see you in my next video bye so to
start off you guys know me I have to
listen to some music and of course dance
with my little babies usually I'll dance
them for a little bit this is what we do
on the day to day basis and then I had
some laundry to fold so I'm just sitting
here folding laundry and then once again
admiring my little puppies look at
Lily's ears how adorable
then I'm going to go ahead and put up
these towels and you're going to see how
the struggle is not only once
it doesn't take one time not twice but
three times to get these towels up on
that rack it's the struggle and then I'm
going to go ahead and take a quick
shower I didn't wash my hair or anything
I just did a body shower and then I
needed to paint my nails so I'm gonna be
picking out a Polish I decided to go
with a red from julep and it's really
really pretty I like it a lot
you'll see it up close here in a minute
and I needed to also put dry shampoo in
my hair so I'm going to be doing the dry
shampoo first so that it just has more
time to soak up the oil and do its job
no no you all got me feelin so and you
know that I guess so after I put on my
dry shampoo and I'm gonna go ahead and
paint my nails the nail salon was
getting a little bit expensive so I just
wanted to go ahead and do it at home and
I'm using this julep wand which is
really cool it's like an attachment for
your nail polish and basically this
makes it so much easier to paint your
nails it gives you more of a steady hand
and I really like it a lot especially
for my other hand like my non-dominant
hand it is so awesome to use it doesn't
make my nail polish look messy or
anything like that because the wand does
Bend so when you use your non-dominant
hand the one rest between your thumb and
your top finger it's really cool I've
never seen anything like it but I'm
telling you guys it's worth the money if
you paint your nails at home and you're
always like messy with it and you can
get this at your local Sephora or the
julep website and actually if you click
the link in the description box julep is
doing a thing where you can get two free
polishes when you click on the link and
buy it from them so if you're interested
in it I'll leave the link for it down
below and you can get yourself two free
polishes and then after I've painted my
nails and they've dried it's time to
cook some dinner because I'm the hostess
with the mostess so I'm just gonna go
ahead and make me and Terina some dinner
which she will be here in like a few
seconds
oh but fun fact about me I hate touching
raw meat oh it grosses me out so you
will always see me doing this with like
a knife or something I don't care how
much of a struggle it is to
get the chicken to flip over I'm not
touching it so maybe a little weird but
I just don't like it and of course you
guys know if you watched my QA I love
green pepper so I'm making one of these
and also cutting up a red onion because
red onions have been my favorite lately
they're just so yummy
now I'm going to do is just put these
chickens on my little grill thingy since
I don't have an actual grill which I
really wish I did but that'll come later
in life and then I'm going to take the
veggies and just put them in a pan and
just cook them on up
now if you are 21 I really recommend
this drink now if you're not 21 then
obviously don't drink it because you're
not of age but if you are of age you
need to try this drink out just take
some Malibu rum and some sprite zero and
then put a crystal light packet in it
and oh my gosh you guys it is absolutely
divine and you put some ice in it it's
just oh so good drink responsibly and
don't drink and drive I have to throw
that in there because you can't do that
and then terena finally came and look at
all this food she came just in time and
I'm just gonna go ahead and make my own
plate and then show you how amazing I am
at cooking not really but look it's Chef
Boyardee now yeah yeah so then we just
like to chitchat eat and you know take
our time getting ready because girls
nights all about just hanging out and
having a good time
and then it's time for the fun part
which is makeup and hair which actually
takes us quite some time so we just went
ahead and did our makeup and hair by the
way my what's on the carpet back there I
don't know what it is but I have to
shampoo it I think it's like dust but
don't mind it because I just took my
closet door down and I was like what is
this a lie floor oh yeah I hope you guys
