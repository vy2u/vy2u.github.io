a highly requested video and it is all
about self tanning and products I use
what I like to do tips tricks anything
like that I'm a huge self tanning
advocate I have been still tanning for
about two years now and that is actually
my two-year anniversary for not being in
attaining bed I definitely recommend
self tanning I recommend it to my
friends my family anybody who wants to
be tan I'm like you need self-tanner
self-tanner is your friend it is some
work but the benefits are much better
than if you're going in a tanning bed
all the time so for this video I've got
a bunch of different self tanners I have
some that are super high-end some that
are not so high-end so yeah let's just
go ahead and get started ok so let's get
started with the self-tanner that I talk
about all the time it is the Vita
Liberata self-tanner in dark this is a
two to three week tanner so it says you
can get this at Sephora I think it's
about thirty to forty dollars so it is
on the pricier side what I love about
this is it is a red based tan so it
looks a little bit more natural but it's
not too red where it looks kind of
orange or just really unnatural you know
there's some self tanners that have too
much red undertone into it and it just
looks like awkward like it's not you can
tell it's not right it looks like a
gorgeous natural tan it is a mousse form
mousse form is one of my favorite ways
of self-tanning I think it mooses are
one of the easiest ways to kind of get
everything all of your body and whether
everything and I've probably purchased
about ten of these at least I go through
these like water because I love it so
much but I've been trying some different
stuff lately so I would definitely
repurchase it I did try the things that
they set on the back like the way to
apply it to make it last 2-3 weeks and I
did notice that it lasted that long at
all I've soaked hair I want to talk
about is another really well-known one
this is a st. Tropez self tan dark
bronzing mousse I was so excited when I
saw that this came out I had to go get
it I think I've gone for about three of
these and this one is actually full I
don't use this anymore because this
is a green based self-tanner which those
are good to give you more of an olive
tan but I feel like this self-tanner has
so much green in it that it kind of
turns out yellow like it makes you look
you have a kind of yellowish tan which
kind of looks a little bit sick leave so
and it is really hard to also find a
foundation to match it
I feel like personally well how it
develops on my skin it's really hard for
me to find a nice foundation to match
perfectly with it since it does turn out
so yellow on me I think if you're super
fair stay away from this if you're about
a medium skin tone I would try it out
because this one is the dark one they
specifically made this to be super dark
which it does give you a stupid art tan
it's just not the color that I prefer
but I mean you can always try it out I
think they have like little samples of
these or something at Sephora I would
definitely try it out if you can because
everybody's skin is different sometimes
it develops differently on other people
so just keep that in mind also with
these self tanners that things can
develop differently I love this for a
while but I kind of once I started
experimenting with different ones and
seeing the different shades this was the
one that I was just done with going with
another green at based self hair this is
the California tan instant sunless
mousse it says develops rich bronze
color - which I believe - is the darkest
shade I got this off Haute look so and
then I have to go on a hunt for it but I
think I paid like $11 for this and it's
six fluid ounce bottle I'm about halfway
through it now and this is another green
based self-tanner or it's like green
olive I keep saying green because it
comes out looking really green I find
that this one doesn't have as much green
as the saint-tropez so I love this one
so much more gives you this deep brown
olive tan it is absolutely stunning the
only thing about this is that I feel
like if I have some serious dry patches
on my hands I cannot apply this to my
hands because it will look like a hot
mess
so just be very careful with this if you
have really bad dry patches or anything
like that this will cling to them like I
feel like it's more intense than any of
the other self tanners that I have so
just be careful with that but one thing
about this subtalar that is like stand
out
is that you have the freedom to rinse
off within one to three hours Oh with
most self tanners you have to have it
off for eight hours I did have this self
tanner on for I say about four hours and
I went ahead and took a shower and it
looked great so the fact that you have
the freedom to rinse this off after one
to three hours is amazing I recommend
waiting the three hour mark just to be
on the safe side but that's still really
good and this also says it's paraben
free I didn't have high hopes for this
one I get off but look I was just wanted
to try it and it has blown me away
okay the last two high-end self-tanner
which I don't know I've been $11 for
this but I'm guessing it's high-end so
we'll see this is the st. Tropez self
tan luxe dry oil this is definitely
different now I don't think this is like
the rest of the self tanners that are
going to give you like a dark dark color
I don't think it's meant for that I
think this is just meant to give you a
gorgeous bronze glow I really really
like this I do believe this is new I got
it just a couple weeks ago and I've been
really enjoying it especially on my legs
like in this every time I think this is
going to be perfect for when I have a
natural tan I want to put this on top
and it gives that gorgeous bronze glow
because it does have like little gold
specks in it so it just looks absolutely
stunning on the skin now it does give
you a hint of color it's nothing like
super dark and dramatic but it does give
some color to your skin so if you're
wanting to give something that's going
to give you more of a bronzed glow this
is the way to go if you don't want
anything that's too dark I think you
would really like this very easy to
apply I apply it with my hands like with
gloves on and it's absolutely perfect
like I said I think for the summer time
this is going to be beautiful over a
natural tan to just really amp up any
tan that you have make you look glowy
especially for the legs like you're
going on a night out or something this
would be perfect to top your legs off
with and what I also like about this is
that it dries very very quickly do stuff
to allow four to eight hours to let that
color develop for you so first of all I
want to start out with this bronzing
spray this was the first thing that I
purchased from Victoria's Secret that
made me want to go back and buy the self
tanner
so this is a Victoria Secret bronze
instant bronzing tinted body spray with
natural natural aloe and right there you
can kind of see the color that's the one
thing about it that sucks is that the
color kind of gets around the rim but
that's okay oh I love this stuff the
color is perfection it is literally just
a bronze color it's not orange it's not
too red nothing it's just a gorgeous
natural tan what I love chooses for is
sometimes my neck and chest will get a
lot lighter than like my arms because it
will wear off really quickly so what
I'll just I'll take this and I'll just
spray it all over my neck and chest or
my legs if they need to be tan for the
day you let it dry you don't wanna put
your clothes on right away so let it dry
I'd say for about 10-15 minutes just let
go do your makeup or something and this
just gives you a gorgeous tan it looks
it just looks so beautiful I dig it
deeper lon
terracotta spray I felt like that was a
little too red for me it didn't look
very natural and this one is definitely
right up my alley it's just nice and
ron's and i don't think it has a bad
smell at all
I actually kind of enjoy the smell which
might be weird now I'm moving on to the
actual self-tanning products I did get
the self-tanning tinted lotion with pure
avocado oil and these self-tanning two
did spray with 360 continuous
application I do want to quickly say the
thing that I love about all of these
self tanners is that they have a color
guard so therefore you can see where
you're applying your self-tanner it's
not a clear liquid or anything like that
these all have color guards so you know
where to rub in that product and make
sure you don't have any streaks now
moving on I want to talk about the self
tanning spray first I love this I think
it's really convenient especially for
your back only thing I'd say out this is
I feel like it does take a little bit
longer to dry but as long as you wear
like a loose tea you'll be good to go
this is only $15 I believe this one's
around $15 as well actually bought three
of these as a backup because I'm almost
done with this one and I knew I was
going to keep going through them okay
moving on to the tinted lotion and then
let me show you guys the color of this
lotion because when I first saw it I was
really freaked out it's kind of just
like a golden bronze color with gold
specks in it so you could probably see
right there I was oh I really like this
one though because it gives you a
gorgeous gorgeous bronze color and this
is also very moisturizing I'm guessing
this with a pure avocado oil Dez it's so
moisturizing it does not dry out your
skin because some self tanners if you're
not careful you'll ply them and it just
kind of dries out your skin and doesn't
look really great
this one doesn't do that it goes on
beautifully I recommend for all of these
items that - the oil that you use a
self-tanning mitt a self-tanning mitt is
really going to give you that flawless
application you're not going to have
like finger marks or anything like that
definitely try out admit if you're
having some streaking issues and if you
are going to use them it make sure you
still use a glove underneath because
sometimes when you use that mitt it
doesn't mean that that color is not
going to seep through and get on your
palm so make sure you put a glove under
on your hands and then put your hand in
the mitt and then apply it so you can
make sure you don't get any products on
your palms also in a mention if you
watched my video from last summer I did
a self-tanning video I believe and I
included the million dollar tan spray
tanning system a lot of people asked me
if I still love that I love it it's just
you have to have somebody else spray you
and half the time I don't have somebody
around to spread me with the spray
tanning system so I do love it though I
love the color I love the way it looks I
love the self-tanning portable machine
so much more than the ones that you go
into for the versus ball because it's
just so much better like you get such an
even flawless tan and you get to
determine how dark you want to be if I
want to be darker I want to have the
option to go a little bit darker and
with the self-tanning systems they also
spray your hands you don't have control
over how much product is going to go on
your hands I know you have barrier
creams and all of that but let's be real
sometimes the barrier creams just don't
cut it your hands end up getting way too
much color on them and it just looks a
hot mess
so girls girls can we can we take a
chill pill on moment films so that's the
only thing I don't like about spray tan
boosts I actually don't go to them
anymore I did try one
a couple weeks ago I just want to try it
again and see if I could twerk it and
twerk it no I just want to see if I
could go in and maybe try some different
tricks that might help and it just
didn't end up being what I wanted so
definitely recommend these self tanners
I had mentioned to all of you these are
toy secret ones though are so freakin
awesome especially this bronzing guy I
love him because I'm always needing to
touch up my hands or my chest and this
is just perfect
especially for a night out or something
it just makes you look like you have
beautiful skin I mean is oh you need
this in your life it is so good and
really quickly I want to mention an
exfoliator this is also the Victoria's
Secret exfoliates body prep smoothing
scrub I am personally a sugar scrub
lover I don't like sea salt scrubs very
much I find that they dry my skin out
and don't actually take off the
self-tanner as good as I want them to
sugar scrubs always do the job for me
love them so those are all these self
tanners and things that I recommend if
you have any other questions that I
can't think of anything right now off
the top of my head then leave it in the
comments below
so I'm going to go ahead and show you
guys a clip of me a self tanning here we
go okay first thing you want to do is
make sure you shake the can up really
well I'm using the Victoria's Secret one
this is the one I've been using all the
time lately and I'm just going to spray
this on my neck my chest pretty much
everywhere even the back of my neck as
well and I couldn't see right here so
I'm just going to spray this all over
you don't have to be super perfect with
it because what we're going to do is go
in with our mitts and we are going to
just rub everything in so like I stated
earlier you want to use a glove
underneath your mitt just so you don't
get it on your palms and then rub all of
this in and this is just going to ensure
you don't get any streaking any lines
nothing like that by the way I wouldn't
use a white towel if you didn't want to
get it dirty
now I'm going to take my arm doing the
same thing just going to spray it all
over and then rub it in with the mitt
when I don't spray this directly on the
top of my hand whenever I'm rubbing it
in with the mid I'll just take whatever
is left over and drag it up on the top
of my hand just so I don't get too much
product up there and make sure you're
really getting the back of your arms and
you're just getting all over with this
product
so you can see here this is the top is
the tan arm and the bottom one is the
one that has not been self tanned yet
so again just do the same exact thing on
the other side
after that I like to go in between my
fingers with whatever is left on the
mitt and then I'm going to be taking
lotion just to apply a tiny bit to my
elbows and my knuckles these are the
places that I can get really dry and
that the self-tanner will cling to
but the lotion really helps the
self-tanner not cling as bad to those
patches so that's a really great tip if
you're having a lot of problem with that
though make sure you're wearing loose
clothes when you're going to bed just so
nothing's too tight
and you want to make sure you keep this
on for eight hours and you'll be good to
go
so that is it for this video thank you
