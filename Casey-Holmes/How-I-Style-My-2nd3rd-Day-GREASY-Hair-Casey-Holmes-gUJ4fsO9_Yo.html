whole squad in here today I'm gonna be
sharing with you guys how I style my
hair if I don't learn we're up in a
messy bun how I style it when I'm on
second and third fourth day hair fifth
day here however many days I've gone
without washing my hair I'm gonna show
you how style and I wanna wear it down
so if you guys are see how you doing
messy bun let me know in the comments it
takes me less than two minutes I can do
a video on it if you want it's really
simple but I don't know if you guys or
they want to see it so let me know in
the comments if you do so right now I'm
just going to take my hair down and
don't mind this I was leaning on my desk
right here and it made indents in my arm
which is always fun all my dogs are in
here today I'm sorry they start soon on
their bones but dog life okay I also did
film a tutorial on this look that I look
it's a first impression if I've already
put it up I'll link it down below if not
it should be the next video up so this
is about what it did what am I on how
much to the bridge game Saturday today's
Monday this is third day hair it's just
sometimes my curls get a little bit
nasty the hair kind of all flows
together throughout the day so I'm going
to show you guys how to style it with
extensions so it doesn't like all clean
together and look really gross it's
actually pretty simple to do this is
just what my routine is so maybe you
could take something from this and put
it into your routine the first thing
you're gonna want to do is use a dry
shampoo I've always used batiste dry
shampoo I love it I love the deep dark
brunette I'm almost out of this one
though like it barely barely sprays dark
so I actually using the medium and
brunette a hint of color so this one's
actually really great I like both of
these I'm kind of filling this one a
little bit more just coming like this
one gets a little bit everywhere on my
hands and stuff but this one's not as
miscible so I really like it my hair is
pretty dark and you can't tell when I
put this in or you can't tell you know
when I brush it out or whatever so you
just want to kind of section off from
here I do it where I'm the most oily
which is always here and right here at
the back like at the very top I guess
it's the crown of the head that's right
I'm usually the most oily now I don't
wash my hair every single day I think
that's a big factor of my hair
super healthy and strong watching it
every day is just not good for it that's
why I'm showing you guys this routine so
hopefully you can find different
techniques and stuff to do so you don't
have to wash it and your hair will just
get a lot more healthier I dyed my hair
one two three four five times this month
and my hair is obviously not that bad it
is a little bit more dry but it's not as
bad as it could be like it's not broke
it off completely up at the top or
anything so you know I think it's due to
having a really amazing hairstylist and
also taking good care of my hair once
you straight and you want to let to sit
there and do it you know it's magic and
soak up the oil and things like that
and I've already got my curling iron on
Oh homeless hit my face with it have my
curling iron on I like to use the
biggest one from nume this is a thirty
two millimeter they'll be using
extensions and I'm using the foxy locks
extensions which are my favorite all I
use is three webs
I have a two clip left a three clip left
Oh drop that one and A four clip left
these are what I use I use darkest Brown
and as you can see they match pretty
dang perfectly so I love them these are
the 24 280 grams I think okay so like
you can see on this one this is a three
clip weft and like you can't even see me
like Hello
but this ooh this is what the West look
like they're really thick band but I
like that because there is so much hair
on this they all really stay put on the
band and it doesn't like shed like a
crazy person I've had these for like
since January and they still look
amazing and I've put a lot of heat on
these bad boys so I just love it it
looks like real hair it feels like real
hair people wouldn't know you had these
in your hair hair hair hair people
wouldn't know that you had these in
unless you told them I love them some
people don't like the thicker bands but
with this much hair you want a nice
thick band to really hold all of this
hair in place and the clips are really
nice too there you snap really well and
they stay put because I do have pretty
silky hair I would say it's not like a
lot of texture at the root so these do
stay put really well though
so yeah I'm using three West's I forget
how many come in the set let me just
show you guys how much hair I have like
I have so much hair from them like I
mean if I put all this in my head I
would be like a Lilly ghalichi on
steroids and I know they're not put in
it now but I usually keep them in this
which is like a little hanger thing and
it's really nice I just I love foxy
locks I used to use a different brand
and then this year I decided I wanted to
try new brands and just different things
because I feel like if everybody uses
one brand it just gets a little bit you
know repetitive so I absolutely love
foxy locks though I just went on a limb
and tried them I purchased my first set
loved it and then I started working with
them which I just I just I love the
brand I think they're amazing I would
recommend them if I didn't think they
were amazing the last set I used or last
brand that I use was the only brand I
had ever used ever it was my first brand
so this is the second brand I've used
and by far this one is my favorite so
I'm not gonna want to do is I've put my
hair in two sections and you're just
gonna want to brush everything out the
dry shampoo and all of that so I'm gonna
do that now it's the most painful part
because my hair gets so and for those
that say that they can't have their hair
going a few days up washing it because
it's like a super greasy so you wash it
every single day keep in mind you have
to train your hair to really stop
producing so much oil my hair used to be
so greasy after the first day and I
would have to wash it I was one of those
people to I washed my hair every single
day so when I first started I would wash
my hair every other day and then when I
got comfortable with that I would do it
every two days and then every three days
and now it's like I can go almost a week
without washing my hair which is insane
I would have never expected my hair to
be able to do this what three or four
years ago so it's just about all about
training it but once you do it it really
helps your hair so much I'm probably
talking a lot but I just want to kind of
give some tips while you're watching
this because I feel like that's
important
brush it brush it brush so now that we
brushed out we're going to go ahead and
section our hair I'm gonna do my first
section here right above my
years so just take this up so basically
I'm showing you how I put in extensions
and showing you how I like curl it and
style it for second third day here oh
yeah that's attractive kind of look like
it and then I'm going to take the three
Clips left and just wrap my brush
through and make sure there's absolutely
no tangles in it and then you're just
going to want to open up all the clips
they're gonna pick one clip there and
clip the rest in and you're just gonna
take this down and section off another
one right above that not too far up just
a little bit this is kind of great for
everyday too if you need extensions for
everyday because it's like not a ton of
wefts so it's not like it's really
weighing you down or anything like that
so now we're gonna go ahead and take
this four clip left and put this in our
hair all clips on them so you just want
to take it
like that and then just let the rest of
your hair down it cut like an inch or
two off of mine just because they were
there so long so just keep that in mind
when you get these you can cut them or
go to a stylist and get them to cut them
as well
now usually I always comb my hair like I
curl my hair almost every single day and
that's just what I like so that's what
you see here is just a leftover curls
and that's why most of my extensions
have like a weight to them because I
always curl my hair so we're just gonna
touch up the curls a little bit just to
make it more volume eyes and make it
look just more put together so you can
see how long these are my natural hair
stops right right here so it gives me
like an extra inch or two and they were
longer than that they were like it down
to my hips
I'm going to section this side of my
head because this side is thinner than
this one obviously because I put more
hair on this side because of my part so
I'm just gonna take a two click left and
clipped it clipped it and clip it right
in here so I don't even feel like I have
to tease my hair for these to stay in
but if you feel like you're having a
hard time and they're slipping just
backcomb a little bit at the root and
you'll be good so you can see now that
they're pretty much evened out I mean
honestly I could leave it like this
that's one thing I love about these is
they hold the wave really well I could
just leave it like this but I'm gonna go
in and just do a little bit of curls and
kind of touch them up so I'm gonna take
my trusty iron and then we're just gonna
take whatever strands you feel like need
some curl and I like to do alternating
curls so I do some away from my face and
some towards my face just so it really
adds more volume main reason why I add
extensions is my hair will clean
together and it looks like a oily mess
even if I do alternating curls it just
doesn't look as voluminous and pretty
after a few days so that's why I add
extensions just to really add some
volume back in there and to make it look
like I just washed it because it just it
looks so much better when I do this and
I love how long and how full it makes my
hair I have a lot of hair as it is but
these root
really give me some volume and I'm like
I'm obsessed with it and these just
these hold a curl for a while like I
haven't curled these extensions and like
two months I'd say until now they have a
nice wave to them so it's kind of just
like a really easy basic you know
routine but I figured I'd show you guys
cuz a lot of you have been asking me how
I put in my extensions you know what I
do for my hair on second and third day
hair and this is normally what I go to
because when I put my hair up sometimes
it breaks off my hair just because
sometimes I pull it back too tight
that's why I have like hairs growing
back in the front of my head because I
kind of pulled some of them out so I
like to leave my hair down most of the
time and this is just the routine that I
enjoy doing
this is one side done I'm gonna quit
curling this side so you put some
product in it like texturizing spray
it'll just look really voluminous and
kind of beachy so I'm gonna go ahead and
touch up some curls on this side and
I'll be back to show you what I do at
the very end and then this is just what
it looks like it doesn't even look like
you have second or third day hair it
looks freshly washed and I feel like
adding extensions and just really help
make it look more put together it
doesn't look like keynote you're coming
on second third day hair cuz you just
added fresh hair into your real hair but
so to finish off this look I'm just
gonna take a little hairspray hairspray
is like very needed for a second third
day hair so we're just gonna lightly
spray it I don't like a lot of hairspray
I like a little bit just to hold it all
