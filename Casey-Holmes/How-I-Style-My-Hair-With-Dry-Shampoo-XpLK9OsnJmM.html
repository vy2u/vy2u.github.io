dry shampoo and how I style it I did
have wavy hair this morning so this is
what I just did I just kind of went
along with the way of your routine and
curled it what you're gonna need is just
a couple things you need your favorite
dry shampoo this is the bio terra dry
shampoo that I got from Sally's not too
long ago I really like this stuff um it
really absorbs the oil very nicely and I
just I've been in love with it I am
really oily hair and it's been hard for
me to find like a really nice dry
shampoo and this has been amazing
then you want your favorite thermal
spring I love the chief I'm invading it
forever now though I do recommend one of
your favorites whichever one you prefer
I use this Conair one-inch curling iron
you get this at Walmart for like what 20
bucks something like that I didn't use
the clamp I need to take that thing off
then the last thing that I used was this
volumizing powder which is your rock
your hair bombshell baked hair powder
I've been using this a ton lately and I
just really love it scuse my tongue I've
been eating some starburst jelly beans
with char hobo but I'm going to show you
guys how I apply the dry shampoo working
into my hair style you know just
everything like that but before I get
into the tutorial I just wanted to
really ask you guys Fusion of my
subscribers and I love your eyes I also
want to thank you really quickly for
almost getting me to 6000 subscribers I
think I'm like a hundred and fifty away
or something we're a little bit more
I'm almost there I've been on YouTube
for three months and I'm just ecstatic
like it's been an amazing experience
it's been so much fun you know talking
to you guys interacting with a lot of
you it's just been a lot of fun so thank
you so much I've been thinking about
down my hair like a chocolate brown like
a dark chocolate brown I think I've dyed
my hair blonde for more than three years
and I just kind of fill out my hair
needs a break and I kind of just want
something different this natural hair
color down here you guys kind of see it
on camera as a dark brown but it's more
like a dark caramel brown like it's not
really like crazy dark at all and I want
like a dark chocolate brown or maybe a
little bit darker I want y'all opinion
if you think that I should dye my hair
then like this video if you don't think
I should denote this like it just let me
know in the comments
I've been really thinking about it I
posted this picture on Twitter
and I had a lot of positive feedback um
of course she had people that said you
know it's super hard to go from back to
after you go from blonde to brunette go
from brunette to blonde which like I
know this I was a brunette like in
middle school and then I gradually went
to this blonde and I've not had any
damage till the last like a year just
having a lot more damage because there
was a certain point it was like my
senior year in high school I didn't
really take care of my hair like I
should've I curled it all the time then
just kind of damaged and from there on
out it's kind of you know gotten a
little bit worse that's you know the
years go on I just kind of want to give
it a break even though I do love being
blonde which I still haven't decided yet
if I'm going to do it but I'm really
debating it my fiance keeps telling me
no but I told him I was like you want me
with hair no hair I'm just I know I
really want to do it I'm kind of scared
cuz that picture was really kind of
scary to me but a lot of people liked it
but it scared me I can tell you right
now
I won't like I want to puke right now
like whenever a salon might just cry I
might tear up I don't know and some
people you know they think it's just
hair like I know it's just hair but I
mean it took me two years to get to this
color and God forbid I don't like the
brown I'm gonna have to go through two
years of dyeing it again like I said you
can always go back to that color a lot
of people said it was damaging when they
did it I've done the blonde routine I
know what I'm doing I've done it before
and I'll do it again if I have to so I
definitely know what I'm getting myself
into if I got my hair brown and don't
like it but let me know what you guys
think you know of course I think about
y'all whenever I'm trying make a
decision know my channel is it's blondie
but I'm not going to make a whole new
YouTube channel if I do decide to dye my
hair I'm going to stay with its blondie
I've put a lot of hard work into this
channel and I'm going to stay here and
plus I don't like it when other people
make channels and make me go subscribe
to that one when they have one that's
perfectly fine I'll just fill up this
glamour like a funny intro and the
beginning of my videos if I do down my
hair because you know why do you care
anyways what the name is I mean
seriously but let me know what you guys
think and let's get on with the tutorial
I quit rambling and you want I hope you
guys enjoy and I'll see you on the next
video
you see my hair is like a crazy message
just took it out of a ponytail and this
is what I got I got kind of like
creasing still a little bit of curl you
know I got a little bit of oily nest
going on you might not see it but I see
it um so of course what you're going to
need is your favorite dry shampoo I am
taking my ring off because this dry
shampoo is dry and like I said all these
in this by Otero one place so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna put this on
my roots and you're gonna see it come
out the cap because it literally is
leaking so I'm just gonna put it like
right here and on this side you see that
so not directly on the scalp yet just
the root and I'm just gonna go and do
the same and kind of like whole sections
I get most the oil around my face so I
like to kind of focus it mainly just in
the very top of my head cause like my
underneath doesn't really do that
so and I kind of focus it towards like
my um like the frame of my face or
whatever so um I did that I'm gonna put
a little bit in the back I know I can't
see it so I'm taking a wild guess I
always do that and I'm just gonna rub it
with my fingers just all over and if you
get something like on your face like
I've done it a thousand times just I'm
taking a tower or something and wipe it
off
and if you feel like anymore just go in
put some more on that bad boy and just
um do what you gotta do so just rub it
till it's basically all in I do still
kind of go underneath you know no just
rub then it's gone okay then what you
need to do while you're looking kind of
crazy is take care of brush and just
brush it out this is when you can start
seeing the difference in your hair and
like that this stuff really has you know
taking the oil out and I will go ahead
and say I could go three days without
washing my hair and it's really all
thanks to this dry shampoo so now that
I've kind of got my dry shampoo in I'm
just going to brush this all out like I
said you can kind of see I have leftover
curls and stuff then what I'm gonna do
is take my chi ironguard and spray my
hair since i'm gonna be putting heat on
it i will be using this connor one-inch
I didn't mention it in the beginning of
the video but I'm just gonna do it says
that kind of have this wave that's what
I basically stick to I don't try to get
like defined curls or anything with my
hair especially second third day hair I
just take any section and just start
wrapping it around the barrel there's no
like Technic twist this is basically
like however you want to do it and you
can get like big legs like this you
could get on smaller ones with smaller
sections but usually when I wake up in
the mornings I have to go to work like I
am I'm always late always it's a really
bad trait that I have I like to just
wrap big sections to get it over with
I'm a huge fan of doing my hair in the
early mornings because it just takes too
much time
so I'm just gonna put this in it fast
forward and I will see you guys in a
minute
you
okay so you can see that I just kind of
curled it back like waved it a little
bit more just so it doesn't look too
crazy because it still had that way from
the night before but now it just kind of
it's a little bit more defined you could
tell I meant to curl is so after I'm
done kind of tweaking my hair you know
whatever I feel like needs to be touched
up and stuff like that take my favorite
um volumizing powder just to give it
some more
my guys I use this more than I got to me
because it's less sticky so it feels
like really nice and it doesn't make it
like super super super sticky so put
some in my hand like I always do rub it
together and just put it all throughout
your roots and just everywhere
and I like it because it just adds the
natural volume it doesn't add like crazy
and stay in volume for the day like if
I'm going out I'll totally use the got
gv1 but if I want something for
day-to-day use I like the rock your hair
bombshell big hair powder or she could
set it with hairspray whatever you
prefer
I don't like hairspray so I'm not going
to so this is the end of it it looks
like you know not greasy or oily or
anything like that it just looks nice
and um kind of back to what it was
yesterday I mean of course not as
perfect but obvious back to just being
kind of wavy so I like I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you
all in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
