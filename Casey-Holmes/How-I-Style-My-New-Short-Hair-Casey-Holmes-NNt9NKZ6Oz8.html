sharing with you how I style my new
short hair I'm on like third day hair
but I figured this would still be a
great way to show you how I curl it and
things like that and oh please
hot iron hot iron anyways I figured I
would show you guys how I style it let
you know what tools I like to use and
the products there's really not a lot to
it and a lot of products or anything
like that and I have coupon codes for a
couple things well only one thing but uh
yeah I figured I would share with you
guys
so we're just gonna take it out of this
mate and get started so oh I'm loving
the short hair life honestly I don't
know if I'm going to go back to really
long hair for a while
I just really love how effortless the
short hair is what I'm going to do first
is I'm going to brush it out I like to
use the tangle teezer brush I've used
this for literally the longest time okay
so like I said I'm on like third day
hair right now and the reason why so
tangling is because I put quite a bit of
products in it yesterday I'm going to do
is I'm going to take my favorite dry
shampoo this is a batiste dry shampoo I
still use the brunette version even
though I've gone a little bit lighter
with my hair my roots are still darker
so I like to the darker batiste and
spray it Oh
throughout now I'm pretty simple when it
comes to hair I like wave I like volume
I don't really switch it up too too much
but a lot of you requested this video so
I figured I would do it for you and I
would show you guys extensions I bet I
think I might have to do that uh next
month because Rose ate a couple left I
mean shouldn't digest them but she likes
chewed up a couple of my West and when
you have short thick hair you need all
your weft so I'm gonna have to get
another set so normally you want that to
like sit and do its thing but I'm just
going to go ahead and brush it out
because I don't feel like waiting for it
and if you wanted to who does my hair my
color and all that I will leave her down
below she's the best she's in Roswell so
if you live like near Atlanta um you
should definitely go check her out she's
the best I'm not like super crazy where
I have to like section every single
piece off that's just not my
I think it takes too much work a section
like this and today I'm using a hot
tools curling irons this is the one and
a half inch I like to go through the
Strand just a couple times to warm it up
and then I'll go and leave a little bit
of the end out and just curl it up like
that really really simple and I like
this method too I also love Dinu me one
and a half inch the clipless wand
I have coupon codes for that I always
have coupon codes for them down below in
the description box if you're interested
that's what I have been doing I started
doing this yesterday and I really like
it but this curl with the hot tools iron
doesn't last as long as if I were to
curl it with my nume clipless iron but I
always leave a little bit of the ends
out but you can see that curl right
there is just going to create a lot of
volume and wave in the hair I - curls
towards my face and away from my face so
when I'm about to do right now it's
going to be away from my face and so if
you wanted to do it away from your face
the wand faces forward so again just run
it through just a couple times then
start twisting it open the clamp twist a
little bit open the clamp and twist it
towards your head but leave some of that
hair out I timed how long it took me to
do my hair not long ago takes me about
10 to 15 minutes maybe about 10 minutes
to dry my hair like blow-dry it but I
just ordered Dyson because my
hairstylist was like oh my god you need
it it's amazing and I was like damn it
Jessica I decided to order it because
her recommendation on it she was like
obsessed with it and she bought it so I
was like okay I have to get that so
hopefully that makes my hair dry like
you know in a shorter amount of time but
it takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to
blow-dry my hair just depending and then
it takes me about 10 minutes to curl it
so if you want the curl to be going
towards your face make sure the plant is
facing towards the back and again just
do that same process and with shorter
hair it's like so much easier you don't
necessarily have to open the clamp to
put more hair through you could just
slide it down and you can use thicker
sections to a shorter hair because you
could fit more of that hair around the
barrel so I'm just going to keep doing
this to my hair
and let you guys watch and then I'll
come back and show you guys how I styled
Oh
Oh
okay so as you guys saw I use the kenra
super hold finishing spray on the other
side do the same exact thing to this
side cover your eyes because I cannot
tell you I just started using hairspray
out of my hair shorter I don't tell you
how many times I've sprayed myself in
the eye and then what you're gonna want
to do is just shake it out
shake all over so this curling iron
gives you just tons of volume which I
love so you get that big wave and a lot
of volume but if you want your curl to
last I would go with the new me one and
I do like to go in with my brush and
just kind of brush it out cuz I don't
want to be too curled just lots of all
you and then I'll go in and backcomb a
little bit so I'm going to take this
first layer toss it over to the side and
take this next layer there's so much
product in my hair from like yesterday
today you lift this up I'm just going to
take my wet brush I'm just gonna push it
down so I don't really want to tease I
just want to kind of back home just a
little bit and kind of smooth it out
over top I don't get like too particular
with this back combing stuff I just do a
little bit because I'm not trying to do
like a ton this sides always thicker
just gonna have more hair on this side
now the best product that I use hands
down is this living proof full drive
volume blast
I bought the sample sizes I was like I
don't know if I'm gonna like it because
I did buy the dry shampoo from this
brand and I did not like it but I love
this you want texture and you want
volume you need this and oh my god it
smells so good it smells so so good and
this lasts all day long so I'm just
gonna lift it up and just kind of play
with it kind of like I would a dry
shampoo besides looking a little too
perfect
and then literally that is it you guys
sometimes I'll set it with one more
thing a hair spray but I am pretty much
good to go and that is how I style you
guys really easy simple I just like it
to be a little more messy lots of volume
and some texture to it when I have
longer hair I didn't like too much
textures because it got so insanely
tangley I say that a lot but it used to
get really really tangley but now that I
have shorter hair it's not that bad at
all and I just really like the extra
texture and I love the way the hair look
once it kind of falls throughout the day
so that's like my favorite part so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video it was
super highly requested I'll leave
everything down below that I mentioned
and like I said I will leave discount
codes for new me if you are interested
thank you guys so much for watching and
let me know what you thought down in the
comments and let me know if you have any
favorite products or any videos that you
want to see and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
