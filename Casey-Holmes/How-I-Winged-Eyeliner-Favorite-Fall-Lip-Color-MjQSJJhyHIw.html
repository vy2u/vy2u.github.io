show you how I do my winged liner I get
so many questions on it and I figured I
dedicate a whole video to it as well and
I'll show you how to do my lips like how
I applied lipstick what lipstick I used
what color and everything like that
absolutely love it it's only a dollar
and it's like my favorite darker
lipstick that I own so if you have a
favorite drugstore lipstick that's like
really pretty and sort of round this
color range like the burgundy type color
then just leave them in the comments
below because I'd love to check them out
and if you're wondering what's on my
face then I will leave that in the
bottom bar below so hope you guys
enjoyed this video don't forget to like
it if you liked it and I will see you
all in my next video bye
so I'm gonna be using my Mac black truck
fluid line I love this so much and I'm
also using the Sigma eyeliner el5 brush
that I love also and basically all I'm
going to do it first is just line my top
lash line I'm just gonna make sure this
is really nice and black not too thick
but thick enough to where you can see it
then I'm just going to start creating my
wing so I'm following my lower lash line
and drawing a line out and then I'm
gonna connect that to the top lash line
the line that we drew up there and you
just want to connect them both and just
really overlap the color make sure it
looks nice and together and don't forget
if you mess up which mine's gonna be
looking a little crazy in a minute we
will have some q-tips so I'm also going
to drag this line underneath a little
bit of my lower lash lines just to make
sure it all connects together and now
you're done no I'm just kidding so I'm
taking the q-tip which is your best
friend when you're using eyeliner and
I'm just going to clean this up a bit
then I'm taking this L'Oreal hip high
intensity pigment crayon liner I'm going
to line my lower lash line and I'm also
going to line my upper or my lower
waterline my upper waterline whew look
now I'm taking the flash bus volume I
have a whole mascara routine you can
check out I'll link it down below but
this is what the eyeliner looks like
when you're done I love it it's super
simple and just a really quick look so
now I'm taking this wet and wild 5:22 a
lipstick and dart wine and I'm taking a
lip brush and I'm just going to start
putting this on my
I don't have a lipliner at the moment so
I like using the lip brush because it
really helps make the line really
precise and not sloppy so I really like
it I'm just going to be filling in my
lips here and same thing here I know I
know crazy so that's basically it I hope
you guys enjoyed this video let me know
some of your favorite fall looks down
below and I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
