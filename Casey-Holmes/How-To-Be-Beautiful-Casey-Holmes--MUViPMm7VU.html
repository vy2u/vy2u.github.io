bit different no some of you if you
haven't watched my channel before you
probably coming on here like why are you
talking about how to be beautiful when
you look like that you look ratchet
I was just sitting on my couch and this
was something I wanted to film and just
put out there for you guys I just want
to be the little bird in your ear today
that really puts some positive vibes
into you and hopefully makes you feel
beautiful and makes you feel good about
being a good human being and being a
nice person the media just focuses so
much on outer beauty and never
intervening I mean if someone gains
weight oh my gosh they're being
scrutinized if somebody doesn't have the
perfect flawless face they're being
scrutinized and if you're amazingly
flawless it's like you're being praised
for it and nobody is praising people for
having a beautiful soul which is the
most important thing in life I just want
to sit down and just share like a few
little tips that when I meet people what
I think is really beautiful and it's
just I think it's something to try and
something to kind of work into your
daily routine I'm not gonna make this
video like 20 minutes long because I
know probably some of you probably want
to hear me talk that long I just wanted
to give you a few tips to really just
hopefully inspire you and to also
hopefully just spark something in you to
just want to seize the day and make
someone's day or make someone smile or
something so have to be beautiful
without makeup and hair let's do it
first thing is to smile me and my best
friend Andy were talked about this last
night I love when I walk into a room and
I see someone smile at me that's just in
general that's with anybody like when I
walk into a room I smile and some people
might be like who is this girl why is
she smiling at me but I'll just do a
little nice smile and make eye contact
and then do whatever I need to do
sometimes it sparks the conversation
sometimes it does it you never know
whose day you'll make if you just look
at them and just
it just changes the energy in the moment
between you and another person that you
don't know I think it makes someone so
beautiful when they have the confidence
just to walk in and just smile and
either and the person you're smiling at
can either take it and accept it and be
nice back or some people just don't care
which those people are usually going
through something and you never know you
might have just made them their day a
little bit better but either way at
least you tried and putting out that
kind of positive vibe makes you so
beautiful
the other thing that I think makes
someone beautiful is when you take the
high road you know what I'm saying when
somebody makes you feel bad or is just
mean I know I know
like I've girls are so bad about this
with each other it's like a competition
daily I just got I can I can meet some
of the most beautiful people but if what
comes out their mouth is just rude and
gross it's like okay but when somebody
tries to bring you down and you take
that high road and you just let it roll
off your back that is beautiful there's
no need to go and try to fight somebody
or do anything like that just because
they want to insult you because they're
going through something that you have no
idea what's going on everybody has their
own struggles if everybody has something
behind the scenes that you don't see and
it's just so important to take the high
road this is something that I have been
working on and at times I do struggle
but I've noticed when I let stuff go I
feel so much better and I don't want to
sit there and have an argument with
someone over something that's just
irrelevant life is so short and you
don't want to spend it with a sour ass
look on her face being upset just
because someone says something rude to
you you know what I mean you just want
to let it roll off your back and just
let it go and you smile and walk away I
think that is so beautiful and it
reflects such a great soul and it shows
your character and that's so important
one of the biggest things I find
beautiful in men women anyone any human
being is giving to someone who probably
give back to you and it's oh gosh when I
think about how blessed I am and knowing
there's people out there that struggle
daily um it's really why am I getting
emotional it's really heartbreaking so
not everybody can help you the way
you've helped them it's not always good
to go into a situation and think oh I'm
gonna give this person this business and
then they're gonna give it back to me
like at some point it's that's not what
it's about every time I see someone in
struggle I try so hard to find different
ways to help them I don't care if you're
if you're homeless and I give you money
and instead of buying food you go to buy
alcohol that's your decision you never
know you might just change what they did
they might go buy food instead of
alcohol this time because somebody cares
and somebody wants to help them in some
sort of way because you just you want to
give back giving back is so important
the more you give back the more positive
things that will come to you I mean you
can give back in any way you can give up
a seat for an older person or you can
help somebody put their groceries in
their car I mean it's so it's the small
things in life that are so important
that just get missed and it's so sad to
see but when you do see someone just
giving back a little bit and just doing
what they can for someone with no
expectations for anything like you're
not expecting them to come back and
return the favor anything that is so
beautiful and that's that's the soul
that I love I love people with a
beautiful beautiful soul because you
would be so shocked at how the smallest
thing could just change someone's world
and they will look at you like you are
the most beautiful person ever they will
not care about how you look how you talk
what shoes you're wearing how your hair
is colored if your no makeup makeup that
they will not see any of that they will
just see this giving caring beautiful
soul
helping them when they didn't ask for it
and then I just want to give a little
more little tip in here and this one's
like it's so important and it's it's one
of those things where a lot of us are
scared to do it
is to tell somebody something that you
love about them no matter who it is no
matter what you're doing somebody in
your life there's reasons why they're in
your life and there's reasons why you
love them and even if it's just somebody
you met for five minutes tell them
something that you appreciate about them
do you appreciate their intelligence do
you appreciate their Drive just tell
someone in your life whether they're new
or old one thing that you appreciate
about them in just a little conversation
it might be nerve-wracking especially if
you've just met a person it's just small
things like that and it will make
someone's day you know we all get old
and gray and people will probably not
remember what we looked like thirty
years thirty forty years from now but
they will remember if you're a good
person so I just wanted to pop on here
and just you know put some positive
vibes out there for you guys and kind of
challenge you and hopefully this will
make you feel beautiful and it will make
other people see you as a beautiful
person no matter what your hair color is
in color makeup looks like if it's caked
on if it's not caked on you know it's it
doesn't matter about any of that if
somebody sees a beautiful soul they will
think you're beautiful so yeah that's
why I have no makeup no hair done and
I'm actually sweaty and I'm sick so I
hope this brought some light to your day
and I hope that it kind of made you feel
good about yourself and try some of
these things out and let me know down
below what are your tips what do you
think makes someone beautiful and leave
a tip or whatever down below that people
can try if you have anything in mind or
just comment below whatever you're
feeling feel free to share this too I
mean it's always good to spread
positivity and feel free to share it I
hope you guys enjoyed it I hope I didn't
put your sleep but thank you guys so
much I love you all very very much and I
appreciate you more than you know and
