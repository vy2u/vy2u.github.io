get to my winged eyeliner and I've had a
ton of questions about how we do my
winged eyeliner half the time when I'm
doing get rated videos or like makeup
tutorials I always assume through the
eyeliner part because it takes me not
too long but you know it's just kind of
like boring just watch me and sit there
and just do it over and over again but I
figured I'll show you guys in this video
how I do it I had already done one eye
so I'm going to show you on another one
and I'm going to show you my two
favorite brushes and my favorite
eyeliner of the moment to actually
create my winged eyeliner so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and don't forget
to thumbs up if it was helpful
and let me know in the comments down
below what video you would like to see
next and leave it in the comments below
if you see one that you like don't
forget to thumbs up that comment as well
just so I know you guys want to see it
and yes thank you so much for watching I
hope you guys enjoy and let's get on
with the tutorial okay so there's two
different brushes I like to use when I'm
doing my liquid liner I have my Mac
tooten brush which just looks like this
and it's very fine and really easy to
get my winged liner and then a dupe for
that is this Sigma eyeliner 11 brush
it's just a tiny tiny bit thicker and
the bristles but it still gives that
same amazing winged out effect now I
have already done this liner and I'm
going to show you how I did it on this
side so today I will be using the Mac
210 brush and this Jordana liquid liner
these are about a couple dollars I get
mine off cherry culture calm so I'm just
gonna shake my liner and I have my
mirror right below me kind of looking
down sometimes I bring it up towards my
face sometimes I leave it down it just
depends on how that liner is going so
I'm going to take this out
and this is what the brush in the
Jordana liner looks like it's really
nice and thin so this is what I go ahead
and line my upper lash line with so I
just take small strokes I start here in
the middle and I just start working my
way out and then I go in
and I try to keep the inner part of my
eye pretty thin because I like to make
the outer half the wing part nice and
you know pretty thick so I'm just going
to try to keep this thin as I can and
kind of smooth this line out because I
don't want it to have like you see how
it kind of has jagged edges right now I
don't really want that so we're gonna
try to just smooth that out here so
again small strokes really is key and
it's hard to talk and do this at the
same time people try to concentrate and
then going in here to the inner part of
my eye I line right in there and then
get back up
just line it out like that okay so after
I've lined that with this I set that
aside and then I go in with my Mac - Tim
brush and all I do is I just dip it into
the little jar which is why the edges
are always so kind of gross and out
there but I just dip it in there and I
brush the sides off I like to start my
wing where the end of my bottom lash
line is so I just kind of flick it out a
little bit and I feel like that's the
best place to start your winged liner
because if you go too down or too far up
it's not gonna look really good and put
together so I definitely recommend
following your lower lash line just to
help elongate the eye so I'm just going
to drag it out again the smaller strokes
and I'm really light when I'm doing this
as well and however far you want you can
go now don't be scared if you do this
because I'll show you how I fix it
but whenever I go as far as I want I
start to go here and I just start slowly
bringing it in towards the line we
created earlier so just like that and
then I like to go over here in the
middle with my brush and kind of just
connect it all together nice see I kind
of have this crazy you know outer half
going on but that's where the most
amazing cotton rounds come in and if you
can find these I've seen them at
Walgreens and Sally's the to the console
of like this will be your best friend
this is like my secret weapon when it
comes to winged eyeliner lately and
making it really nice and flamed out
like that these are the main key to the
winged eyeliner just gonna wet it and
then I'm going to just clean this up and
I just kind of pull and drag right
underneath that winged eyeliner now I'll
even take the other side and I'll just
kind of clean that up as well
and then after I do that I like to go
back in for Dana brush because it is so
thin I just think it's so flimsy though
whenever I'm doing my outer half of my
winged liner sometimes it's hard to get
it nice and steady and where I want it
so that's why I use a brush like the Mac
210 or the Sigma what is it 11 but I'll
take this and I'll just go in and touch
it up just always remember you want to
definitely connect your wing to the
inner part of your eye and this is what
I mean when I want it really thick out
here and then we're fit in the inner
part of my eye and then that's pretty
much it it's super easy and I find that
these products are really great to work
where it's kind of in the medium it's
not too dramatic and it's not too subtle
so thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed and I will see you in
my next video
