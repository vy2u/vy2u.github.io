all about my winged eyeliner and a
lashes tutorial I figured I'll combine
this into one video just to kind of kill
two birds with one stone so you guys can
see how I do both things I've never done
a false lash tutorial so I'm really
excited about it and I have done
eyeliner tutorial but I feel like I've
gotten better since my last one and I
kind of do different techniques and I
also use different products so I
definitely wanted to show you guys today
if you wanted tutorial on this eye look
let me know I'm thinking of doing it for
a spring look it was super easy three
shadows and I was done and I really like
the way that it turned out so let me
know if you guys want to see that it's
still kind of on the oranjee side which
I want to do in a different orange
tutorial so let me know what you want to
see I might do like a get ready with me
with one that's a little bit more
dramatic and then this one for spring so
yeah the two main stars of this video is
the England gel liner in number 77 I got
this when I was in New York and I loved
it it's by far the blackest most amazing
eyeliner ever and I just started getting
into Jo liner and I feel like I've
already got it down pat so this is by
far the best and then of course my
velour lashes I love these and I did
purchased these my own money if you are
wondering because I know we have some
Curious George's out there but I love
these lashes I purchased quite a few the
two that I always buy I bought one that
were the lash in the cities I think but
I've bought like six of these three of
the girl you crazy and three of the
dolly ups just so I was set and the door
me up and go you crazy or my favorite
but it won't let you guys know I do
finally have a coupon code for you guys
and I will leave it down below it's 15%
off of your order which is really nice
especially with how pricey these are
it's good to have a little something off
so if you're interested in that I will
leave that down below these if you've
been watching my tutorials for the last
month or so or maybe a little bit longer
because I'm the only lashes I've been
using just because I can reuse them so
many times so I did talk to this video
and it's about time for me to stop
talking and let you guys see the
tutorials so let's just go ahead and get
started
okay so I'm going to line my waterline
with the NARS larger-than-life eyeliner
in Via Veneto I think this is a um but I
love this eyeliner because it really
stays on my waterline I do have putting
watery eyes oily eyelids so it's really
hard for a lot of products to stay on my
eyeballs basically and this is
definitely one of the products that
always stays and no matter what it's
perfect so filling in for a really good
eye liner I recommend this one I know
it's super expensive but a promise shoe
is worth it I've already purchased two
of these and I will definitely continue
to purchase them okay so what I'm lining
the upper waterline what I like to do is
just kind of put pull this up and line
that inner rim right there now when I do
this it looks really scary because I
kinda like roll my eyes back because I
want to put myself in the pupil and
stuff like that so I'm gonna do it
off-camera I'm going to show you guys
the difference between one eye and the
other eyes though hold on
okay so right there you can see that
these lashes look a lot more fuller even
if you don't mind the bottom lashline I
think up lining the upper one just makes
a huge difference okay so the aligner
I'm going to be using today is this
Inglot gel liner in number 77 by far the
blackest black eye liner I've ever used
in my life got this in New York
I believe you can order in block online
I haven't really looked at it um but I
want to show you guys two different
types of eyeliner brushes you can do the
angled eyeliner brushes which just look
like this they are super dirty so I'm
sorry but they're both just angled
eyeliner brushes or you can use the one
that Minnie's today which looks like
this this is the Sigma II ten and then
these two are basically the same just
ones more affordable the one to the
right is the Sigma e65 and one to the
left is the Mac 280 so the similar ones
just a little bit more affordable
I like the Sigma E 10 just because I
find it super easy to work with and
sometimes I feel like the angle the
angled brush is kind of get caught up in
my lashes and it's just a mess so we're
not doing that we're going to stick with
the pointy one because I just feel like
it's easy to work with
but I'm going to just dip my brush in
here let's see I'm just going to pack
this kind of on sometime
it on the brush and then I'm just going
to gently wipe off any excess I want the
brush to be coated but I don't want it
to be like clumpy on the brush so that's
why I'm just doing this and I find that
Jo liner is so much more black and
beautiful so that's why I've been using
gel liner a lot more lately now I'm
doing the Ling liner it takes a lot of
practice so please keep that in mind
don't be upset if you don't get around
the back because I promise you to me a
long time to figure out to get it right
I've done some bad eyeliner good
eyeliner you know you just have your off
day sometimes so just take your time
with it don't rush because that's
usually when people mess up the most now
the key to a winged eyeliner is you
really want to line it up with your
lower lash line so all I'm going to do
is take this brush I'm going to follow
that lower lash line out
being very soft with this I'm not like
I'm putting like a lot of pressure on
these this brush because we did put
quite a bit liner on it so if you just
gently start drawing out the line it'll
come out really pigmented but just going
to touch up up just like stuff so there
is the wing of your liner now we're
going to do the rest of our eye and I'm
dipping my brush back into the gel liner
and scraping off any excess for any
clumps I should say and we're going to
go to the top part so I'm just going to
align my top part per usual however you
want to do it I like mine a little bit
more round not so much straight across
so I tried my best to get it a little
bit more round you can do it however you
prefer different eye shapes do it
different ways so I'm just going to make
mine a little bit more rounded to go
along with my eye shape and go into that
wing
now some people find it easier when
they're doing is to do short strokes I
do show short Lawrence tongue twister
I do short strokes and the fist part of
the eye from here in and in short
strokes through from here I like to do
kind of long strokes just because it's a
little bit easier for me so do whatever
works for you
and what you want to do is start off
small and then build up that online so
start with how we get thin line and then
work up to the desired thickness that
you would want
dang almost had a perfect line but then
I messed up right there we'll fix it in
a minute so - that little goof I have
the line is pretty much how I want it
now it's time to fill in that wing so
again you shouldn't do coat your brush
and take off any excess and then what
we're going to do is I'm going to take
it from about here and drag it to
connect it to the line we have on our
lid
and then when I'm doing this you see how
the wing is not as slicked oh well oh
I'm doing this I'll kind of go out here
and touch up and just flick it out a
little bit more okay you see how that's
kind of thick right there don't worry
about it because we'll fix it in a
minute without adding more liner so this
is the basic winged eyeliner that I like
to do pretty simple and then I usually
just go back in and fill this in make
sure everything is nice and smooth and I
don't have any like choppy lines or
anything now to kind of save your lives
with eyeliner I recommend these pointed
q-tips just because they get to that
area that you want them to be so I'm
going to get right in here clean this up
hopefully this is not an easy liner to
take off so when you messed up it's kind
of like you messed up big time so there
we go doesn't look bad we're going to
clean out this outer line right now so
what's nice to do is take little
concealer brushes like this this one is
eyeshadow want to someone say that all
but little eyes like this and I'll take
concealer and literally shake out the
outer half I'm going to do is take any
concealer you want tank I love this Mac
concealer palette is the pro conceal and
correct palette in medium I love this
I'm using it for so long and you can see
I've hit pan on one of the colors and
I'll be hitting pan on this one pretty
soon but I'm going to fix a dark and
like show you just because it's right
there under my eye and I don't if you
need to me too dark or too light okay so
what we're going to do is sharpen out
this line take your concealer and just
drag it up like so beyond and you don't
want to like start stop start stop
because it'll start to get jagged you
really just want to have a smooth even
stroke then I kind of took the concealer
in like so and you can see right there
it just kind of flicks out your winged
liner and there is your wing now you can
see since you did line up with our lower
waterline it just kind of flows out
really nicely put together in this wing
turned out really nice so I'm really
happy because this is a tutorial but so
this way when you put like stuff on your
waterline it all just kind of flows and
connects together you really want to
make sure you line it up and even though
like I have really droopy eyes you can
still do a winged liner because what it
does is it lifts up your eyes and make
you look more awake and I just I love
the look a winged liner with my eye
shape just because when it's so droopy I
need something to really lift it up and
the wing will do that I don't think I'll
ever stop doing wing just because I love
what it does to my eye shape so that's
basically the winged eye right apart I'm
going to quickly do the other eye and
I'll be right back to show you guys well
flashes now we're going to do false
lashes and false lashes is one my
favorite parts of makeup now just
because I've really gotten into it and
it really changes the makeup look and
really opens up the eye so by far my
favorite lashes are from the Lord so
these ones all are called grow you crazy
definitely what my favorites are super
full and I just love how kind of wispy
they are there's full and wispy and then
another pair that I absolutely love are
these that are called doll me up which
are one of my favorites as well
if you're going to buy some I definitely
think those two are best ones to buy now
first thing I like to do when applying
false lashes is I do like to curl my
lashes because mine kind of go down they
just kind of hang down and don't lift up
like I want them to because I don't want
them to be like saggy with the lashes I
want them doing really blend in next I'm
just going to take a mascara any sample
mascara can work I usually use sample
mascaras when I do this because I don't
want to use like my nice ones so I'm
just going to apply this all over my
lashes I'm not going to focus too much
about applying a ton of mascara because
we are going to have falsies on so it
doesn't really matter so I'm just going
to coat my top lashes because sometimes
they can get discolored or look too
light especially after you've applied
eyeshadow and stuff like that so you
want to make sure they're going to be
just as black as your falsies now I have
never used this glue before this is from
house of lashes I actually got this base
off recommendation from Amanda I'm an
ins in zhing and
she says it drives really really fast
and I've been wanted to try it was like
eight dollars I think so I bought two
because last time I tried to buy this it
was out of stock so they'll be kind of
like a first impression for the both of
us but I'm usually I use the dual lash
glue in clear but like I said today
we're going to do something different
and I'm going to just put this on the
lash like so now you probably owe me as
much glue as I put on it but I put on a
decent amount to cover the man just so I
know that they're not going to you know
fall off during the day or something so
I'm just going to shake them for about
15 to 20 maybe 30 seconds I'm sorry look
this eyes like all out of the game but
I'm about to put this one on this side
so just make sure they get nice and
tacky because if you don't let them get
tacky they are so horrible to put on I
think that's the most common mistake
that people when they're trying to apply
false lashes that's like the most common
mistake everybody makes because some
people don't know how to let it get
tacky and then it just kind of goes all
of your eye messes up your eyeliner and
looks a hot mess so just make sure they
get nice and tacky I don't know what
this glue looks like the color at least
when I gets tacky but we'll just wait 15
to 20 seconds duo takes forever to get
tacky I've personally feel like think it
takes so long so the glue is tacky now
I'm just going to apply it I'm using
tweezers to apply it some people like to
apply it with their fingers I think that
is way too hard so I like to use
tweezers and I focus on putting it down
in the middle first so wherever I want
it to sit in the middle that's where I
place the lash first so just going to
and you want to get it as close to lash
line as possible so then I go into the
inner corner place this one where I want
it to go oh yeah this up gets tacky and
then the other side
look how cool that glue looks it's like
a Bluegreen how awesome and then you
just want to let that glue dry and then
we'll go back in later and clean up the
liner make sure it's nice and black so
again we are going to take this lash guy
and so far I'm liking this glue it got
tacky pretty quickly and it was super
easy to apply the lashes with so I like
that a lot so again I just coat to the
lashes nicely as you can see I'm sorry I
gotta get my nails done going today
after this video but just coat them
nicely at least I do I put like number
the line I probably put too much glue on
but I like it like that so you can see
the difference between this eye and this
side is just more full and fluffy and I
feel like it makes any makeup look look
2 times better
I already cut these to my eye shape but
you definitely want to measure out your
lashes to see if they're too long the
lower lashes are super long and so
whereas keto I had to cut so much off my
mosquito lashes but definitely measure
them up and see how much you need to cut
off and always cut from the outside in
don't ever cut from the inner corner you
want to cut any length off on the
outside just so they'll still look
natural on your eyes because you don't
want like super long lashes all the way
here your inner corner it just won't
look natural I would have showed you
guys that but I don't have any lashes
that I need to cut right now
these I've used these numerous times on
you know how many times I forgot to
mention you can use them up to 30 times
and as long as you take the glue off
easily and don't like pull the lashes
too much they'll last you awhile so
again we're going to take this lash and
we're going to set it in the middle
first close to that lash line
go into the inner corner
and then the other corner
so you can see right here you see a
little bit of the glue not much cuz this
glue is pretty much amazing so I'm going
to just take my liner brush again and go
over that lash band and wherever that
glue is just to make sure it really is
seamless with the on liner and there you
have it that is the winged liner and
lashes and that's just how I do it
okay guys so that is it for this video I
really hope you enjoyed it and learned a
different technique or something
different to do with your liner or
