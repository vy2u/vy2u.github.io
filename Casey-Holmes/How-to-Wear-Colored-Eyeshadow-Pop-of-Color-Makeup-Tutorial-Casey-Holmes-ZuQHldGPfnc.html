sharing with you this makeup look this
is a makeup look I had in my spring
must-haves that I uploaded a few days
ago so if you want to check that out and
all the makeup products that I recommend
for this upcoming spring then just check
it out in the description box below I
know a lot of people are kind of scared
to really dip their fingers into color
and wear it on their eyes so I decided
to show you guys how I did this look
it's a great way to incorporate color in
your look and kind of change things up a
little bit without being too dramatic
flower lashline is very colorful we have
a different color on the waterline the
lower lash line
and the eyelashes so thank you guys so
much again for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video and let's just go
ahead and get started and get started
okay okay so the first color we're gonna
take is creme brulee these are all from
makeup geek so I will leave all the
names down below because I don't
remember the names of the other ones but
I'm gonna take this shade and put it all
over my lid and just into the crease
area it's going to be our transition
shade then I'm gonna take this medium
brown color and I'm gonna put this
directly into the crease but I'm only
gonna focus this on the outer half the
reason why I'm putting this into the
crease is just to add a little bit of
definition and depth to the look so it's
not just a completely flat looking eye
you know what I mean we wouldn't have a
little pizzazz in it right so I'm just
going to put this into the crease and
just pull it out really really nicely
now for this look I did want to make
sure that the lid was very simple a
little bit of shimmer but we wanted the
main focus to be on the lower lash line
then I'm gonna take the shimmery shade
which reminds me of steel as eyeshadow
and kin it's not as glittery but it's a
very very gorgeous shimmery champagne
type of color and I really love it I've
been using it a lot lately on my lid I
like it cuz it really just opens up the
eye and it's super easy to work with and
it just looks really pretty so I'm gonna
put that all over the lid and then go
back in with that brush with no
additional product and just blend out
any harsh lines so then I'm gonna go in
with my liner and then these lashes from
Koko I'll put the names of them down
below and then I'm going to be applying
my number 7 beautifully beautifully
matte primer and then I'm gonna apply my
favorite foundation of the moment which
is this L'Oreal foundation I think it's
the infallible matte I should probably
leave these and speak a little faster
but I love this foundation you guys like
I've been wearing it so much I think it
makes my skin look gorgeous and with
this makeup geek face brush oh my god
it's like the perfect combo if you guys
want a drugstore foundation routine with
an eyebrow tutorial involved with it
that's also drugstore like this video so
I know to do that for you guys but this
is a medium coverage foundation you can
see a little bit of my redness is
peeking through but when I put on this
mac prolongwear concealer I do it in a
really large triangle underneath my eye
so it highlights the face but also
covers up that extra redness that was
kind of peeking through and it's just
pretty much the perfect coverage ever
and then I'm taking what's left of this
NARS concealer and putting it on my nose
if you even watched me for a while you
know I pretty much used this concealer
on my nose and that's it I just don't
like it for underneath the eyes just set
everything I'm taking this kat von d
palette and the yellow powder and
setting everything I highlighted and
then I'm gonna go in with this Bobby
Brown bronzer and a golden light and I'm
just going to bronze the skin with my
Mac kabuki brush
Oh fool you didn't except we're gonna
take this shade from the kat von d
palette as well and just do a little bit
of a light contour I don't want anything
too heavy I just wanted a little bit of
definition a two at the face then moving
on taking this makeup geek blush which
has been my favorite at the moment it is
called saturation it is just beautiful I
mean and it's perfect for pretty much
every single look that I do I just I
love it so I'm going to blend that out
after I applied it and then I'm gonna
take a Becca's highlighter and opal
Thelma and the self-tan wrist you know I
should just have a disclaimer and all my
videos like don't mind the self - and
wrist it's just the struggle is the
struggle so I'm going to put this
highlighter on the tops of my cheekbones
the center of the nose lip and a little
bit on my forehead and chin
and then when to apply my NYX eyebrow
gel which again if you guys want to see
a full tutorial on this and the
drugstore foundation let me know by
liking this video
after I filled those in I'm gonna take
this Rimmel eyeliner in nude this is
kind of like a non necessary step but I
just went ahead and did it so what I did
in the last video so I figured why not
do it again now I'm gonna take this
darker purple and really push this
against that lower lash line so we have
a good bit of definition and we can
really smoke this out so just make sure
you press it right up in there right at
the root of the lower lashes and then
we're gonna take wisteria which I
mentioned in my spring must-haves and
then I'm going to smoke out this lower
lash line I'm really gonna drag this
down quite a bit because I want to make
sure you can really really see it it's
such a beautiful purple and it doesn't
look crazy on the eyes like it is just
oh it is so pretty wisteria is like a
color you have to have in your life I'm
not a huge purple eye shadow person but
this is making me love purple eye
shadows now I'm taking this makeup
forever blue liner honestly you can use
anything I was trying to find a purple
liner but I didn't have one on hand NYX
has some really good liners like this so
just check out NYX at Ulta or the
drugstore and they should have something
similar to this but I'm gonna put that
on my lower waterline and then taking
this NYX mascara in a pink I forget the
name of it I'll put it down below I'm
gonna do one coat of this and then I'm
gonna move on to lips and then come back
and do one more coat just so it's really
nice and opaque and you can see it and I
think the pink purple and blue just all
complement each other and really
brighten up this face I just I love it
gonna take this lip liner from Paulo do
I'm not sure you can find this at Ulta
in the drugstore section and I'm just
going to put this on my lips this isn't
the shades gingerbread and it's a really
creamy lip liner and I just love it then
I'm going in with my Too Faced melted
lipstick in melted nude and I'm gonna
put that on top of that and this has
been one of my favorite nude lipsticks
of the moment I just cannot stop wearing
it and then four on top of that I'm
gonna take this Maybelline Color elixir
in a nude illusion and for me this like
brings everything together this lip
gloss is just so gorgeous and I love the
way it feels on the lips so I'm gonna
put that on and then like I said I'm
gonna go back in with that NYX mascara
and top that off
then I'm gonna touch up my liner sing a
little bit and focus focus liner I
didn't realize how jagged my right eye
was until I was editing and I was like
oh man but you know that eyeliner life
might as well leave it so I'm gonna
highlight my brow bone with the same
shade we use on our lid and then you are
done so I hope you guys enjoyed this
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
