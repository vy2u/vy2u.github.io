a tag video it's one that makeup by Ali
came up with it's the I love drugstore
tag I think I don't know it's one of
those but I fell in love with it I was
actually going to film a drugstore
favorites video today but I saw this tag
this morning and I was like oh my gosh I
have to do it because I just fell in
love with it I was a great tag so I'll
put her channel down below and also her
link to her video if you haven't checked
it out but I wanted to do this one
because it was so fun and different and
I've already tried to film this one so I
have swatches on my hand ready to go so
right before I get into the tag actually
I mentioned I did create some playlists
on my home page on YouTube I created
like 13 or 14 playlists I can't remember
but it was a lot but I have them
basically I have a playlist for hauls so
any haul videos you want to see that you
haven't seen in mine
they'll be in that playlist if you like
getting ready videos I have a getting
ready playlist where all my getting
ready videos are so I just want to let
you guys know about that they did create
some playlists for you so if that's the
kind of specific videos you like to
watch then you could go to that playlist
and watch your favorite kind of videos
there so all you do is just click my
name go to my YouTube home page you can
scroll down and on the right hand side
there will be all my playlists right
there I'm going to go ahead get started
there's 8 questions oh by the way I'll
be tagging on specific people down below
but if you're not tagged feel free to
still do this and leave it as a video
response because I would still love to
see first question is what is your
favorite drugstore makeup brand and
that's a hard one I feel like there's so
many different things that I like from
different brands but I feel like
Maybelline's my favorite drugstore brand
because I love their mascaras I love
their color tattoos I love their
eyeshadows I just love it off next
question is what are your favorite face
cheek and lip products so for face I
picked this Revlon Colorstay liquid
foundation for combo oily skin I love
this stuff so much it's been really
really great I've talked about it a lot
lately and then 200 face products I love
I talked about this a 10 as well it's
the Physicians Formula cover tops
Tim powder I think this is so amazing
and it's just awesome every purchased
this like three times I think and then I
also
to shout out this Rimmel match
perfection concealer in light I love
this a lot it's just one of my favorite
concealers to use every day also like I
said talked about this a ton as well now
for cheeks I have some different
products so the first brand I want to
shout out is Rimmel so this one right
here is autumn catwalk and this one
right here is spring flower and I just
think they're really great and I don't
think people usually talk about them a
lot but if you haven't tried them out I
recommend you do I got mine from Walmart
I'm not sure where you can get them
otherwise I know my CVS does it have
them so just kind of look around and see
if you can find anything like that
and then another brand I have shout out
is wet and wild this is the pearlescent
pink blush actually I'm all of them this
is the one I've really used a lot and
that's just what it looks like it's a
really really pretty color and it's just
like three bucks I think so
that's a steal and then the last one is
a duo for cheek products and this is
what I've talked about lately
it's the elf contouring blush and
bronzing powder I love the blush it's
great if you have kind of a lighter skin
tone and then the bronzer is really nice
as well so love this little thing and
it's only six bucks so that's a really
great deal and then for lip product I've
talked about this for so long
even people who privately messaged me on
Facebook and YouTube and stuff have
asked me what's my favorite lip product
and it's always been this this is a
Revlon
what is it color burst lipstick and this
is what it looks like this isn't the
color soft nude and this is just the
perfect nude ever I've never seen a
drugstore nude like this even a high-end
drugstore nude I just this is amazing it
doesn't dry out your lips it's a nude
it's just perfect so I really love this
if you're wondering about a swatch this
is it right there so it's really really
really pretty and I highly recommend it
next question is least favorite product
that one was easy for me because I hate
this eyeliner for somebody that uses
eyeliner all the time and I've used it
for years this has been the hardest one
to work with and the one that I actually
really do hate this is the Milani
infinite liquid eyeliner this is a up to
24 hour wear and it's in Everlast so
this is just what looks like it's an all
black tube with like gold right
and stuff on it but check it's just so
goofy and so difficult to work with I
just like I can't even it's just so hard
to work with I can't stand how much
product comes on the brush
it's just not my favorite so that's
definitely my least favorite product
from the drugstore next question is what
is the best makeup bargain and I have to
agree with makeup by Ali and it's
definitely wet and wild I chose I have a
few cause here and some single eyeshadow
this eyeshadow on top has actually been
my favorite highlight and it's Brule and
it's in the single eyeshadow form but
the other two are really great too but
these all are just so pigmented so
pretty the only thing is I wish they
came back out with the vanity and greed
pots because I feel like these were the
best palette saver came out with the
baked one was really great as well if
you got just picked that up but the
petal pusher palette these are still out
and like there's a blue one and then
there's comfort zone so these are just
really nice they're super pigmented easy
to blend and they just look really great
on the eye and they're super super
affordable so I really recommend trying
these out next question is what is your
favorite underdog product and I
definitely I mentioned this in my last
video so if you want to see it on I'll
link that down below but it's gotta be
this lipstick from went wild in 5-2 - a
dark wine it's so beautiful I love it so
much and this is only a dollar so I
thought that was crazy this is what it
looks like it's so pretty like I said
you'll see it in my video down below if
you go check that out but I love this
color it's super nice it's so so so
affordable and I feel like it lasts
really long on the lips but even if it
does fade throughout the day it kind of
stains your lip that color so it's just
a really gorgeous stain but a lipstick
also I don't know and it doesn't dry out
your lips at all so I love this one it's
just like wet and wild I don't know if
it's a certain type but it's just in the
gray little tube like this so really
recommend trying that out next is a
drugstore product that is overpriced and
I'm gonna have to say a brand with this
- this is definitely Physicians Formula
I know I tell you guys I love that
powder so much and I really do and I
continue to repurchase it because I do
of it but that brand is so overpriced is
ridiculous I've tried numerous things
from them and they've all just
completely sucked
other than that powder I just don't
understand why they're so expensive when
they're not that great at all I've tried
a mascara from there I tried some eye
shadow palettes I've tried bronzer and
they've all just completely sucked so I
think they're definitely overpriced and
I think they're the priciest ones in the
drugstore so I just that brand is just
way too much I think so the next
question is show your best drugstore
dupes I have a few of those so the first
one is actually a blush from Mac and
this is in pink smooth this is probably
a dupe everybody knows about but if you
don't Mac pink spoon I'm a great dupe
for it is this elf blush and pink
passion they are very similar definitely
different textures of course coz elf is
cheaper but you're looking at like what
20 bucks versus $3 so that's amazing
they're definitely good dupes and if
you're wondering these are the two right
there you can't really see them because
they're both really light blushes but
they're really nice dupes I'll put them
on my fingers for you so this one is
pink spoon and this one is elf they're
really really nice so that's definitely
a great dupe if you haven't heard of it
before next is another blush stick this
is a matte blush I think it was limited
edition I could be wrong but I think it
is this is in feeling flushed and this
is about $25 per blush but a really
great Duke for is this wet while blush
and Heather silk these are what the two
look like together and I think this is
an awesome awesome dupe so let me show
you that's wet wrong so this is the dupe
this is wet wild and this one is the Mac
one and they're just so similar it's
crazy and if you're wondering that's
them two beside each other so this is
the wet wild and this is the Mac one
they're very very similar and there's
such a huge price difference so if
you're looking for more of a cheaper one
that I definitely recommend Heather silk
from wet and wild the last one is an eye
shadow dupe this I don't know if this is
Maybelline arrested I mean a
slotter or Lancome I've had this quad
for literally forever you can probably
tell I've pretty much almost completely
cleared out this thing other than these
two that are actually you could tell
they're really worn out but this is it
this color right here is the dupe so you
get all my finger for you so this is
that color from it I used to be obsessed
with this color in high school I thought
it was just the most gorgeous thing but
this Maybelline quad and chai latte I
think this is pretty old too but it's
still a really great dupe it goes so
well with that one obviously the
Maybelline one is darker but they're
very similar in like the sheen and how
much glitter they both have I think
they're just really awesome so these are
both of those side by side top one is
Maybelline and the bottom one is the
Lancome one I stay water whichever one
it is okay so the last question is a
drugstore product that isn't worth the
hype now this is just a personal
preference don't get all offended by it
but um it's definitely this Maybelline
mascara this is the mega plush the
packaging is so cute as main reason why
I even bought it but this mascara does
nothing for me I wish it did but it
doesn't everybody else seems to love it
but I don't know there's just something
about it that I don't like I don't like
the formula I don't like what it does it
just doesn't work for me so that's
definitely the one I think that isn't
really worth the hype so so thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
