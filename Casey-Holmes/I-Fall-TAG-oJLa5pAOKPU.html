tag i was tagged by Miss Jim fabulous
who actually came up with a tag and i
was tagged by missglamorazzi the daily
cupcake and i can't remove else I don't
know who else I me but I'm gonna go
ahead and start i got the questions in
front of me i know i've been really in
today's tag videos i think they're just
perfect so I love doing them so the
first one is favorite fall lip color and
cheating cuz I kind of have three so the
first one is actually what I'm wearing
now thank you guys so much to whoever
recommended the crush um kissable balm
stain from Revlon I'm obsessed with it
oh my god you guys were so right it's
the perfect color so this is what it
looks like and you guys have to excuse
my jacket um I'm cold this crushed one
is amazing like i said i have it on
right now and i think this is definitely
going to be a go-to so that's what it
looks like really really pretty colored
and i don't know if anybody recommend to
this one but i decided to pick it up
it's Revlon lip butter in sugar plum
this is going to be another favorite for
the fall this is a gorgeous color I feel
like all these colors are a lot more
pigmented when they're on your lips but
they still look really pretty so there's
that one and then the last one you guys
have already seen or had this on um in
my winged eyeliner video it's the wet
wild lipstick in dark wine that's what
it looks like and then here's a swatch
if I think those are all the way my
staples for fall I don't know about like
red lips or anything I haven't really
tried super red lips but i'm really
loving like the berry colored lip
products next one is favorite fall nail
polish and i'm going to have to go with
this color i'm really loving it it's the
SE um what is it aruba blue actually on
this on my toes right now and i'm
obsessed with it i love it so much just
is the most gorgeous blue ever so this
has to be my favorite fall nail polish
um next question is favorite starbucks
fall jury but I never tried the pumpkin
spice latte I kind of
have any like willing to want to try it
at all um mostly in a long time when i
get is like a caramel macchiato um you
know just hot so that's my Starbucks go
to drink for the fall favorites all
candle and again I'm not like a huge
bath and bodyworks person I don't know
I'm just not I don't take time out of my
day to go to Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and just
stop so but if I had to pick one it
would definitely be my clean cotton
candle that I have anything that smells
like clean clothes clean cotton favorite
fall scarf or accessory definitely boots
for accessory i mean i have to say boot
but for my favorite fall scarf i feel
like i'm gonna get so much use out of
this I got it from charlotte russe i
wore it in my last video it's just a
scarf with bows on it and in the bows
are skulls so I love this scarf i think
i'm gonna wear a ton this fall and
winter because i just love it so much
i've got a ton of compliments on it like
I said I dig it from charlotte russe i
got some questions in my last video if I
knew the style number no i don't i got
it from the store and if you can't find
it online or in the store i don't know
where else you can get it so I sorry
next is haunted house haunted hayride or
haunted corn maze I love for anything to
scare the crap out of me like I love
scary movies I love anything like that
if it scares me i'm gonna love it so but
for this i feel like i'm going to have
to go with a haunted house cuz hug
houses you're just fun you're going with
a bunch of people and it's just like I
don't know it's fun next question is
favorite Halloween movie and I cannot
for the life of me I think it's called
Halloweentown but it's the three witches
I've always loved the blonde one and
then there's red head of one and the
dark-haired one I love that movie so
much I watched it every year and it's so
funny I just I love and that's
definitely my favorite Halloween movie
but other than that anything scary like
I know there's a bunch of new scary
movies coming out so I really want to go
check those out next question is
favorite candy to eat a Halloween and
that is definitely
candy corn oh you guys I love candy corn
so much even like the pumpkins are
really good too but I'm all about some
candy corn next question is what are you
dressing up for as Halloween um I don't
know yeah I don't know what i'm dressing
up as I never usually know and if I do
dress up it's so last minute and so like
put together but um I don't know why I'm
dressing for is Halloween and what is
your favorite thing about fall I feel
like I love the weather I love the food
um I love anything I loved also that
it's family-oriented like there's so
much family stuff going on and you know
I don't really see my family a lot
during the year so it's good to kind of
get together and eat and like see my
little cousins and stuff like that it's
definitely fun so I definitely think
family and the weather and the food it's
just my favorite i love it i love his
time of year so yep that was my tag if
