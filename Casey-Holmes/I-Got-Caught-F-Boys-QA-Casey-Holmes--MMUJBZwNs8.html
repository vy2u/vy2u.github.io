and I wanted to get into some casual
clothes and film a Q&amp;amp;A video for you
guys because it's been so long since
I've done a Q&amp;amp;A video for you I went and
I made myself some hot chocolate and
it's really hot someone put that right
back down and I had to make hot
chocolates at a coffee because it is
11:33 I would love a cup of coffee right
now but I will never go to sleep if I
drink a cup of coffee right now we're
just gonna be laid-back answering some
questions I can't even remember what
these questions are because I screenshot
them a while back it was like a few
weeks ago so I made like a little folder
of all my screenshots
parlez asked do you have a new boyfriend
and PS you should toast do a town a
house tour Georgia seems so Oh a town
tour Georgia seems so cute and pretty
show us around girl love you I would
never do a town tour to me that's too
personal um and I don't have any
boyfriend oh god no I'm not even close
to having a boyfriend have it I've been
talking to this one guy about going out
on a date of like next week but I
haven't messaged him back because
there's a bug in here stop how did he
get in here anyways like I was saying
before I found that there was a moth in
the house I haven't talked just one guy
about possibly going on a date oh I
guess oh be a date I don't know next
week and he asked me if I was free and I
still haven't text him back that's how
my dating life is going can you say
something in French I can't I can say
I'm pretty sure this ah say I have not
taken a French since elementary school
and I took French all through elementary
school
I'll have songs come on my head at some
points um like during my life that are
French that I remember and I'll just
start singing about loud people are like
what are you doing but um Vanja Zuma
Belle Casey I'm pretty sure that's
correct the correct Wednesday there was
so much I learned and I really wish I
didn't have to take Spanish in middle
school nothing wrong with Spanish but
like I loved French French was my thing
and Spanish I just could not get the
hang up so I loved French it's a
beautiful beautiful language finster
penat said weirdest hat
okay I do this thing where if I'm bored
anxious um just kind of all the above I
do this thing where I go like this to
the back of my hair and I start feeling
the strands like right here at the top
of my head and if there's a strand
that's like crinkly and not smooth I
will find that strand and pull it out of
my head it's just something that I do if
I'm anxious or bored or just kind of
like thinking too much uh it's so weird
habit to have I used to pull my eyebrows
when I got like a lot of anxiety I would
sit there and I would pull out some
eyebrow hairs but I don't do that
anymore I've done the head well I've
done the one on my head for years like
so long I'm so surprised that I have
hair up there but it's not like an
everyday thing it's just if I'm in the
car or something like that from talking
to somebody one girl said if you see a
guy walking towards you do you start
looking from the top to bottom or from
the bottom up ooh
I definitely top to bottom like I like
to look at the face first and then see
what I'm working with for clothing and
stuff you don't have say I don't know
I'm always I always look at people's
face first like facial features are
first impressions to me I guess it's
just always the first thing I gravitate
towards and then as I'm talking to you
my little eyes will just go
just see what I'm working with aha Oh
God
step step up your game set the last text
you sit is the only thing you can shout
during text what is it ha ha for once no
lol that would be kind of weird that's
not too bad

goal of mine I just always thought about
it and it's just such a big thing for me

goal of mine I would love to achieve and

Miss DJ asked the thing you're most
self-conscious about show up that twine
girl southern girls for life I had to
say on camera I feel like some of my
southern accent does come out but not as
much I think it's just because I'm so
focused on filming but it doesn't come
out as much as if you were to see me in
person and talk to me in person my
southern accent just really comes out I
mean I have a little sayings I say all
the time I always say god bless america
bless your heart I'm very very southern
I just think when it comes to filming
videos I I get a little more I know how
I'm speaking but no it's really weird if
you watch some of my like my first
videos I really southern in those I
think I just kind of went a little bit
more of a professional route but don't
worry the southern is coming back into
the channel don't worry I promise you it
will folks say my teeth right now
because I have these tooth here here
they're shorter than the rest of them
they're called something I forget what
they're called but those teeth teeth
really drive me in saying that they're
not the same length as the rest of them
fit crust or thin crust thick crust all
the way I love thick crust pizza you
can't beat it so good hello here's one
if you ever if you have to set your
alarm clock do you only step one and get
up right away or do you set at least
three I oh my gosh if I'm flying the
night before first off I'll get like
three hours of sleep but I will set my
alarm to six different times it's so bad
and when I'm getting up I definitely do
at least three at least three alarms
because it takes me a hot minute look
miss little Johnson when was the first
time you realized in your last
relationship that you two weren't going
to work out um we were together for four
years and I knew we wouldn't work out
right after we got engaged
pretty soon into it you have to leave
your TV on one station all day what
be definitely Bravo I have not changed
my TV station from Bravo unless it's
Saturday is which is super cross so they
only it only changes one day out of the
week and that's Saturdays when it's
super cross time and then after super
cross is over we go right back into
Bravo oh my god
Ava Elise 13s what was the most
embarrassing thing that happened to you
okay well so I met this guy when I was
in Buckhead if he watches this I will
never hear the end of it and this guy in
Buckhead so cute and I was just like yes
this is everything I'm so excited so he
got my number or whatever and we started
texting well if you guys told me on
Twitter you know sometimes I post like
little conversations of me and like if
I'm having a conversation with a guy
it's funny I post it because it's just
funny and most of the guys that I I
think they don't follow me on Twitter
like it's just not something I feel like
they do right away so I was okay I
posted a couple of our conversations on
Twitter and then I get a text later that
says you post in our conversations on
Twitter and I was like Dale you are
looking it up I was so embarrassed like
I I got caught I have not gotten caught
before but I got caught that time and I
was like no oh god it was so bad but he
was totally cool about it a lot I'm
boyfriend Oh Felicia steffeff and I was
chosen to be on The Bachelorette what
five guys would I want to be fighting
for me on the show okay
so let me think about this Chuck Bass
Nate Archibald chef from southern charm
one of the property brothers
whichever one single I can't remember
his name but one of them single so one
of the property brothers
and last one chris hemsworth done could
you imagine
honestly you don't even have to fight
for me they could all be my boyfriend
gabs asked have you ever talked to a new
guy back and forth just for his
girlfriend to text you saying and don't
text my man anymore I've never had a
woman text me and say don't text him but
I have talked to a guy numerous times
not numerous times but I was talking to
him a lot and then found out he had a
girlfriend
randomly his boys are dogs by the way
speaking of dogs I am NOT getting
another one but I have been keeping a
journal ever since I broke up with my ex
about all the dating experiences that
I've had and just like things I've been
I've been going through with these guys
and with my channel I love keeping it
makeup and hair base but I do want to
bring a little bit more personality into
it and be a little bit more personal
with you guys and really big into dating
and relationships right now so um I was
wondering if you guys would want me to
read out of my journal sometimes like
read a couple pages and kind of see a
little bit of what's going on right now
I'm in the stage of writing about a boy
if you don't know what a f boy is go
look it up on urban dictionary because
there's a lot of F boys running around
the world and we just can't deal with
them so we just write it all in a book
put it in the book honey you should call
my journal the bird book for men there's
no women in there only men you guys
would like me to do something with that
journal that kind of read it off a
little bit I don't want to read like the
whole thing because I would love to
tweak it and make it into something in
the future but for now I think it'll be
fun just to kind of read you guys a
little bit of something and I just kind
of want to do some different videos with
relationship stuff so let me know in the
comments if you want to see that and
like this video if you want more
relationship-type videos and fun and
serious you know you gotta have a little
bit of both can't be serious all the
time you know what I mean but answer one
oh ho God speaking of F boys someone
said tell us the f boy story you're so
funny and I feel like we're having a
sleepover and gossiping when you're
telling your stories um oh thank you
Claudia I
that'll be saved for if you guys want me
to read on my journal because lord have
mercy honey
that I've come across quite a few F boys
and I can't deal with them anymore
hey it's Lex asked what got you into
liking motocross and would you date a
guy who races motocross um well my ex
got me a motocross and that kind of sums
that up he got me the Supercross and
ever since I have been addicted like I
love it it's something I truly just
enjoy I stopped things in my day to
watch it if I'm not able to watch it I'm
on Twitter
watching the feed of like who's in first
most of you know who I root for I root
for Eli Tomac and I do root for wil Hahn
I was um rooting with my ex for Ryan
Villopoto I do like Ryan Dungey as well
I think he's a great Rider and I mean I
like I like a bunch of different people
but mainly my number one I have stuck
with since I started loving motocross
was Eli Tomac and for me I don't think I
would date a motocross rider just
because I haven't had that great
experiences with motocross riders um
they're very busy they don't it's like a
weird vibe it's like the ones that I
have met
they are then how do I describe it it's
like I don't know if it's me I mean it
probably is but they are just not
they'll say one thing and do another
look if you have plans they can't make
it or if they make plans they cancel or
it's like they don't want to talk to you
but they kind of want to talk to you
it's like a weird thing I can't figure
them out so like don't get me wrong I
love my space it would it wouldn't be an
issue with not having them around all
the time it's just I would still want
some sort of contact and I feel like
they're too busy for that so probably
not who the hell knows I mean I can't
even text like a guy who lives like 15
minutes from me
okay guys so that is it for this Q&amp;amp;A
video I really hope you enjoyed it and
don't forget to like it and subscribe I
love you thank you so much for watching
and I will see you guys in my next video
