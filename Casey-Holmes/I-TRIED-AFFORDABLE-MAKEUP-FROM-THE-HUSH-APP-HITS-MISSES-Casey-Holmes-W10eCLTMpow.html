to be trying out some new makeup from
the lush app and I've had a lot of you
requests for me to do this video I know
they have a lot of dupes on there but
they also have some other things like
random stuff that I figured I would try
so that is what this video is going to
be on you all requested this and I
figured I would just go ahead and test
it out it took me a while to actually
get on the app and purchase everything
because I wanted to go through like
almost all the pages this is what I
found I believe I have a complete full
face of makeup in here and yeah I'm
excited to open this up and show you
guys so if you're interested in seeing
what I got and how it works out then
definitely keep watching and don't
forget to subscribe before you leave
let's just go ahead and get started
Davis and I were watching scary movies
and shows every weekend and I feel like
I pulled out all my eyebrow hairs when I
checked out you could get like a free
thing so this was the free item I think
I'm just gonna get that away because
I'll never use those we have an eyelash
curler with some little crystals on
there was this free too I hope that was
free too because I didn't need to buy
that yeah so this is a free new user
gift so hello excited
so I dig it I shadow primer this is the
Katie B shadow insurance eyeshadow
primer
it says anti-crease eyeshadow primer I
love that there invoice comes with
pictures on them so you know what you're
looking at I can tell what the price is
and this was nine dollars as you guys
can see you don't get a full tube of
product it looks sticky because I just
pulled it out in some of its like
sticking to the top can you guys see
that this does not feel hot oh this
feels so greasy and like really tacky
okay I'm gonna do one eye with this
primer and one eye with my regular
Smashbox primer yeah ooh that feels
awful okay so it's kind of drying down
okay I'm just gonna work with this
primer it seems like it's drying down
we're definitely gonna have to set this
one but it is really goopy like sticky
packaging is really cheap again this is
nine dollars it's not like two dollars
it's nine dollars
I'm definitely going to see if I like
this or not because nine dollars is not
necessarily that cheap for an eyeshadow
primer oh but it does dry down so let's
just hope it works out
I'm gonna take the Aurora Aurora this
bad habit I shadow pile and I'm gonna go
in with a dream state which is this one
right here and I'm gonna set my entire
lid with this I have knots watched any
of these colors yet though I'm excited
to see how they look okay that yellow
it's pretty pigmented okay maybe not cuz
it's like why does my lid look like it's
so dark now from that primer it looks so
weird I'm gonna go in with awakening and
put this into my crease really pretty it
does have quite a bit a kick up on the
palette but it looks pretty so far but
as you can see there's quite a bit of
powder coming up it's just like dusting
up now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
into mystique the shade we're gonna go
right underneath that first shade that
we used it is just a little bit darker
but looks very similar with a crease
brush just deepen it up very pigmented
how much was this this one was $12 oh
wow
and for me like I totally get some
pallets that have a lot of kick up
actually purchase some new eyeshadow
palettes from flower Beauty that are
beautiful but the amount of kick up that
they have is kind of like oh but they're
so pretty it's like one of those things
where if it's affordable I try not to be
too harsh about it because it is
affordable then again if I'm gonna go
through the eyeshadow and like a few
uses I'm like okay let's take ecstasy
right yeah ecstasy which is that green
and put this all over the lid it looks
super pigmented we're gonna use the Mac
242
you guys know I love
is brush and pick up some of that color
and put this on is there a film on this
yes I need to take this off all right
let's put some a lid that is so pretty
I'm gonna leave a little bit of this
inner part open because I want to put a
different color there do you guys see
how pigmented this is holy shitake
mushrooms I love that color
that is so incredibly pretty I don't
think you guys are getting the full
effect of how beautiful it is but it is
beautiful and this one doesn't have a
lot of kick up or anything
I hope this color combo I'm doing will
look good I'm just kind of going in with
color to think of pretty is that really
deep orange we went in for the second
time and blend this out okay it's not
wanting to blend no come on alright let
me go in with ecstasy actually and see
if I can just fluff this into that
crease to blend it out you can do it
blend I'm taking a little bit of that
same green shade with my blending brush
because I'm just trying to diffuse it
out into the crease so it's not like a
super harsh line because I don't feel
like it really wanted to blend by itself
so that's kind of a fallback but if you
just take that color and blend it into
the crease it will kind of fade up like
that it does look a little messy and but
it is so pretty
okay now I'm gonna go in with Sol even
with Sol little gold over here into the
inner corner
mm okay
I'm gonna take a little bit of
phenomenon on top of that to lighten up
that gold just a bit it's very kind of
looks like a foiled eyeshadow hmm I feel
like I don't actually hate the color
combo it's something different
but I don't hate it and I think it looks
okay I mean this look does not match my
pink sweater dress but I don't think
it's terrible actually
I think it's intimidating because right
now we don't have any face makeup on but
I don't hate it
so our lip color definitely is not gonna
match this makeup look middle line my
eyes I'm going to use this profusion
eyeliner it's a matte eyeliner and it's
supposedly waterproof this is the same
brand as my contour palette that I
really love that it got from TJ Maxx
we will see how this works it kind of
looks like it was opened in a way I
don't know if you guys can see that can
you see like the smudge marks on it it
looks like it got beat to hell and back
oh my gosh and it has the littlest tip
ever this eyeliner it was five dollars
looks very shiny to me doesn't look
really pigmented at all kind of looks a
little sheer like it doesn't want to
actually build up and be a super intense
black line oh my goodness this is not
looking like a good eyeliner profusion
what happened
I'm gonna go ahead do my other eye with
the Milani stay put matte eyeliner I do
really like this one does have a bigger
like felt tip but it's really good see
how much more intense that one is with
like one go around like literally one
dip into the tube crazy and I believe
these are on the same price and then I
did get flutter lashes which I'm super
excited about these were a little bit
more pricey these were $10 I got the
style prestige and I'm excited I haven't
tried flower lashes and so long I feel
like I used to use flutter lashes all
the time whoo
okay this is the Roode mascara obnoxious
volume makeup with an attitude that's
too funny
this one was five dollars and fifty
cents I know you probably won't be able
to see too much because of how dark the
eye shadow is but trust me I always know
when a mascara is gonna be good or not
it's I think the name is super funny so
this is what the packaging looks like
woohoo and it kinda looks like covergirl
LashBlast volume don't mind my hands
okay
rude obnoxious volume I'm about to have
that when I put on these flutter lashes
they're definitely more separated and
like fluttery but they're not voluminous
the essence one that I use it's like 18
hour false lash is much more volumizing
so I would get that one instead and it's
also cheaper than this one so okay so I
actually just put glue on my false
lashes and I'm gonna go ahead move on to
face so we have this beauty creations
poreless face primer this is what it
looks like what does this remind me of
oh the baby skin primer that's what it
reminds me of from Maybelline is that
still out like I have no idea so this
was seven 17:07
this primer was seven dollars I mean I
liked that primer but it wasn't great
for oily skin because
and is that making me pretty oily so
yeah this looks pretty much identical
I always know don't mind my hands by the
way my fingers I just ruined myself tan
I got self attained all over them but
whenever I try primers like this I
normally know it's just not it's not
gonna work out because they are so
greasy like they might minimize look at
your pores but in return it's just like
a wheel slick oh that is strong if
you're kind of sensitive to smells
I would probably pass on this because is
it's very like intense we're gonna move
on next up I got this Pro luxe matte
foundation this is a medium beige this
was ten dollars says nothing I was gonna
show you what it says on the packaging
but is that nothing it does say it's a
matte foundation what that's dirty on
the bottom I did not do that but it
hasn't been used from what I can see
this color might be a little light for
me because I did just self tan and it is
it isn't so light okay so I went and
just wet a sponge and I also grabbed my
Catrice prime and fine transforming
drops these are the darkening ones I'm
gonna use a Beauty Blender today a
normal sized sponge believe it or not
sorry that my self tan is so off like I
used a different one for my hand look at
my hands I don't know what happened you
guys I think I was tired putting on my
self tan and then when I put it on last
night I was running out of my loving tan
self-tanner so whenever you're running
out of it it doesn't get as dark so I
can tell that I need to change it up and
throw the one I have a way because it's
too light for me again this one's in
medium beige with quite a bit of this
Catrice darkening drops in it says that
this is a matte foundation still pretty
light
okay how's like a full-coverage finish
that was just with one stripe on my face
actually doesn't look terrible right now
it's pretty dang good definitely gonna
have to bronze my skin with my bronzer
luckily I'm not going anywhere today so
it's not too important to me I mean
that's pretty nice though
feels pretty lightweight definitely a
matte foundation but it looks good so
moving on to concealer again this is
that same brand Pro luxe and this is in
light/medium so hopefully this is not
darker than the foundation because
sometimes I feel like light/medium
concealers can't be darker than certain
foundation so that's what it looks like
it does have a seal around it does look
pretty like peachy in a way oh let's
just do one eye at a time and see how
this goes a little nervous
it's how I always apply my concealer
does look a little bit darker than the
foundation like it looks really yellow
the concealer is pretty although the
foundations pretty pink it could
definitely be worse it doesn't look bad
it actually looks pretty good over the
foundation so that's a plus just blend
out this inner corner you can't even
tell I have concealer on alright moving
along and there's a lot of product that
comes off the sponge I also don't think
I told you guys but this concealer is
eight dollars again it's the pro luxe
concealer it's really not bad I don't
mind this concealer actually though I
got two powders we have the no-sebum
blur powder this is a natural mineral
and originated mint powder I don't know
that means but this right here was ten
dollars so I also have this H d-flawless
setting powder and it's bright it's in
brightening of banana and it says set
and perfect your makeup to last just on
the super lightweight and visible
finished powder to impart finely milled
color correcting yellow pigments that
instantly diffuse redness Brian
complexion and smooth away the
appearance of just color
raishin non-drying formula designed to
mattify excess oil keep makeup in place
and impart a flawless they love the name
or they love the word in part that
flatters all skin tones without caking
or chalkiness sounds like music to my
ears so excited to try this out you guys
know I love powders that have that
banana tone to them you you get a lot $9
this is quite a bit of product that's
what the power looks like I'm gonna take
my sponge and set underneath my eyes oh
it is crazy on if you guys could see
that so we need to go ahead and set this
really quickly oh that's really yellow
this is a pretty dark banana color so if
you're more on the fair side this will
probably be too dark for you because
it's a little too dark for me it's kind
of darkening up the foundation see let
me take this powder this one again is
that no sebum I should probably look
that up I feel like I've tried saying
that before this has a really nice puff
I'm gonna keep that one and this one has
a little bit of a tint to it as well
probably should use this one instead I'm
just gonna use this one with a brush and
put it all over my skin nothing crazy I
think I want to use this one instead of
the banana powder because it is a little
bit lighter so that banana powder is a
little too dark for me if you're more of
a deeper complexion than I am it
actually might work for you
it didn't look bad on the skin now we're
gonna move on to bronzer contour palette
this is very similar to the Kat Von D
one except it's in a different tin so
this is the contour contouring palette
from Oakland I guess packaging reminds
me of the Naked palette that's what the
inside looks like and then I'm gonna
take this middle shade and try to warm
up my skin hopefully it's not too dark
holy so what I'm gonna do since that was
just too dark and the other one's too
ashy and then the other one is like too
dark for me I'm gonna use this Catrice
Sun glow bronzing powder now that I've
got some bronzer on I'm gonna take that
same shade I was gonna go in with and
contour my cheeks I didn't even really
dip my brush in there
I'm gonna take this blush with she looks
are very similar to Mac blushes this is
a mineral blush from KTP it is in the
shade peaches and it is nine dollars so
it looks so similar to Mac they even
have like the little sticker on the top
oh my gosh I miss going to a MAC store
and like this looks identical to Mac I
miss going to like a MAC store and
getting so excited over Mac products I
mean I do get excited over their
products but like I don't really go to
Mac stores anymore because I just I
don't know holy crap I didn't go back
into my blush here please blend out
first off thank you to me for getting a
peachy blush it goes with this look very
very similar to Mac blushes I think this
is pretty good for nine dollars I love
that color okay we're getting somewhere
alright now we're moving on to
highlighter this is the sorry I'm
looking down so much this is where all
the prices are this is the bad habbit
paradise highlight kit this was $10 this
is huge for $10 so I'm really excited to
see how this works out
resting bitchface sunkissed white sands
in my tie oh these are looking perfect
gonna take my Nastasia 83 actually I'm
gonna mix these two can you guys see
that oh my goodness
that is gorgeous
I really like this one good lord
dang I like it a lot I'll definitely be
using this one in this one the most I
won't really ever use this this is just
too pink coral for me two out of the
four for $10 I don't think it's bad at
all I'm gonna go in with the super slim
brow stick this is a brow poor finding
pet or brow perfecting pencil and this
is by Bonita this brow product was five
dollars joy feels a really good deal
y'all know I've been into brow pencil
lately so this one does have a spoolie
this is in the color
cappuccino Who am I did I water
cappuccino I did all right so I'm just
gonna go in and start filling in these
brows
whoo I'm liking this it is a little dark
I feel like this would be a brow product
I need to use on the outer part of my
brows but it's actually filling in
nicely ooh I like this this is nice
definitely need a lighter color for the
inner part look at how pretty that is
okay I need another I need a lighter
brown color and normally go back and
forth with two different colors for my
brows anyway so this isn't anything
crazy I mean anything on the ordinary I
guess I should say oh this is my bad
brow gonna take a little bit of this
wet-and-wild ultimate brow mascara
because it has a tint and it'll kind of
lighten them up a bit I actually really
love the eye shadow combo that I did
it's something a little bit different I
was a little nervous but I actually kind
of liked it I think it looks cool I'm
actually gonna going with extacy this
one and push this up against that lower
lash line you tap off that brush pusher
right up in here just so it goes along
with the eyelid ooh that is pretty even
though I didn't want to blend out too
well it is a really gorgeous color you
just got to work with it a little bit
more I'm thinking this is like a dupe
for the huda beauty palette that I'm not
thinking of right now I kind of went
into this not really looking for dibs I
just really wanted to try them out and
see if they had good product I'm taking
a mixture of the two orange shades right
here that we used earlier and just
blending out underneath that lower lash
line then the last step I think is just
mascara on the bottom lashes I am going
to just skip the lip product because it
doesn't match oh I kind of like this
mascara for the lower lashes even though
I just got it all over the inner part of
my eye too soon I'm not gonna use this
this is a little too mom for the look
that I have on today so I'm gonna add
something a little bit different but
then I will come back and let you guys
know what I think of everything and we
will wrap this video up okay guys so I'm
gonna give you a quick little recap of
my favorite products I'll let you know
what I like about them so far and what
recommend that you go and check out I
really do like this bad habit palette I
think it looks really good on the eyes
it was a little bit difficult to blend
some of the shades out but for the most
part it was really pretty I love these
colors I think they're different they're
arranged differently and just for me I
think it's really pleasing to look at
and it makes me want to try new things
kind of like all these colors together I
tried something different and I really
like the way that it turned out so I
like this palette I'd recommend it I
think it's really pretty it looks more
expensive than it actually is so it's
good I also really like my flutter
lashes that I have on right now in
prestige and they're fluffy they're
dramatic you know how I am
as well as the Bonita brow pencil this
was very very nice I liked it a lot the
concealer was really good too I think
the colors a little bit off but it was
really nice I'm actually gonna try with
my la girl foundation very soon but this
is the pro luxe concealer in light
medium did it mine
this foundation but I like my la girl
once it looks a little bit smoother on
the skin so this was not terrible I'm no
why it's dirty on the bottom yeah I
wasn't terrible it just wasn't my
favorite not gonna use it again same
with this contour palette I probably
won't be using this too much I don't
know we'll see this didn't like blow my
mind completely but it's not terrible at
all it's very very pigmented so just be
warned does have quite a bit of Fallout
as well I will probably never use this
again just because these kind of primers
don't normally work well for my skin I'm
already kind of getting oily in my
t-zone because this is not a mattifying
primer this is more for like filling in
your pores so I probably won't use this
again if you're sensitive to smells
definitely be warned of this it smells
like oranges it doesn't smell bad just
not bad it's just very what is this
peaches that's what it smells like
like the two-faced peach collection
that's exactly what it smells like so if
you liked it the baby skin poreless you
might like this this bad habit brand I
tend to like some things from them
because that's what that eye shadow
palette is too so I might have to try
out some more bad habit product and
again this is the highlighter palette I
did like these two is what I have on my
face as you guys saw right now
definitely keep you guys updated on this
but I think it's really nice so far as
well as this little Mac blush to dupe I
think this is really great this is
probably gonna be
a lot by me because I love peachy toned
blushes anything like that so I'm
probably gonna use this a ton I would
pass on this profusion eyeliner it was
just bad as well as the rude obnoxious
Volume Mascara if you're looking for
something with lots of volume I don't
think this is a mascara for you and for
these powders I'm gonna have to pass on
this one it's just a little bit too dark
so I'll pass on this one and I'm
definitely gonna keep trying this out
and want to see how it looks with my la
girl foundation and stuff like that this
was $10 and it is tiny so we'll see but
yeah I don't think this will top my
makeup revolution wide but I'll just try
it out let you guys know at the end of
the month I think this site is legit I
think you can find some awesome things
there I would probably try a bad habit
for anything as well as this Pro luxe
brand I think they have really great
stuff let me know if you guys have tried
anything from this app and what you love
about it thank you guys so much for
watching stay tuned for my shop miss a
try on haul coming soon very very soon
I'm so interested to try that up stay
tuned for that video it's coming soon I
think you guys again so much for
watching and I will see you all in my
next video
did you ever know somebody left the city
