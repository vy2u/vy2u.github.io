sweet all the nice things you guys say
to me every day is just amazing and it's
just been an awesome ride so far coming
up in January to be my one year
anniversary on YouTube I'm not sure
exactly which day but it's like the
first couple weeks of january i'll have
to figure it out I'm so excited I can't
wait to give these prizes away so the
first three sets of prizes will be
international and then the second set of
three will be for us hawaii in canada
only because that's the only place where
new me ships but i will personally be

bottom bar so please check it before you
just randomly start entering so the
first place prize for the international
giveaway is the lorac Pro palette now I
don't even have this palette I'm
actually really jealous I was like I
want this so bad but I decided to give
its way to you guys instead it's a
gorgeous palette everybody has raved
about so much on YouTube this is what it
looks like it's gorgeous and you get a
little behind the scenes I primer love
it so first place winner will be getting
this second place where we'll be getting
my cult favorite palette talk about all
the time use it almost every day and
that does he make appellant I know a
bunch people talk about this palette for
such a long time but I personally love
it so much I felt like I needed to give
it away because some people haven't had
the chance to pick up this palette so I
wanted to give one away to you guys and
let you see why I love this palette so
much it's just gorgeous you get an eye
primer and you also get a little brush
on the inside of this palette so this
will be the second place winner for the
international giveaway and then for the
third place you will be getting this
benefit sexy stowaways this has a ton of
different stuff for you to try out and
I'm obsessed with it i think is a great
thing so you first get the hula benefit
bronzer that gal brightening face primer
alabama blush Porefessional primer it's
potent eye cream bad gal lash you get
some bean chacha hit la la which is what
is that again ooh la la lives is an
instant under eye brightening boost and
then you also get to try to stay don't
stray i shadow primer i love this little

try out different products so again
these are the three prizes for the
international portion of this giveaway

this is open to Hawaii US and canada
only I'm sorry for Alma international
loves that's why I had to go buy makeup
for you guys because I wanted at least
everyone to participate this last three
set surprises will be from New me and it
is the curl Jam set I personally have
one and I love it it's a curling wand
and you get three barrels you get the 32
millimeter the 25 millimeter and I think
it's the 15 so you get all three sizes
which is perfect and you just switch out
the barrels on 11 so that's great at
like saving space and that set also
comes with a hair straighter so you'll
get basically three curling irons and a
straightener all in one thing so three
winners will be getting that you can
pick a pink zebra one and a purple zebra
one I think that's the only two colors I
have but it's a great set so if you
