today I have a different video for you
I've been seeing this video go around a
lot not so much recently but within like
the last month or so and I figured I
would give it a go because you guys know
I love a full glam makeup look if I do
something it's usually smoky and sexy I
also love my more natural looks now
there are a lot of similarities to both
look but there's also a lot of things
that are different and just compare
gonna do this video and share it with
you and honestly looking at it like in
the viewfinder is so funny to see like I
kind of wish I did my full face like
vision I think it's so cool to see the
difference and just see you know what
different makeup techniques can do to
your face I do want to quickly say the
real life side is not like an everyday
makeup look or make up probably about 3
or 4 days on the week we all know if you
follow me on snapchat I'm a real big no
makeup person - I love no makeup just as
much as I love a full glam look but
sometimes I want to put makeup on but I
don't want to do this side and spend the
extra 30 minutes you know doing this so
I really hope you guys enjoy this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you do like it and subscribe before you
leave and if you want to see how I got
both sides of my face then let's just go
ahead and get started okay so what we're
going to start off with its eyes first
and this time is going to be my
Instagram side first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to prime my Instagram
side because if I'm just doing like a
day-to-day makeup look I don't prime it
I just use concealer just because this
is expensive and I don't feel like
wasting it I'm going to take some tape
you guys know I do this all the time for
my makeup tutorials and just my glam
looks took up some of my self tanner and
I'm going to angle this from my lower
lash line up to my brow I like to do
this to get a sharp line instead of like
having to go and clean it up and all
that what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to kind of leave this
side bare because you're going to see
how much work I put into this side one
this side when I'm doing like a
real-life makeup look like something
more natural I do my foundation first
and all that because I don't really
focus on the eyes much so what we're
going to do is we're going to go in with
this japonesque palette this is the
Decimus oh this doesn't what a nice
matte shade is that with this cream
shade right here
honestly I I'm doing a natural makeup
look it's because I want to wear makeup
but I just don't
going to really focus on blending my eye
shadow next up I'm going to take this
shade right here and blend this into my
crease because showing this palette
because I got it towards the end of last
year I didn't do a favorite video last
year because I had to do a 2016
favorites so I just kind of skipped it
but I really do like this palette for
just some easy staple shades next up I'm
going to take this shade right here with
this Sigma and I'm sorry this is the
morphe you buy one for and little bit
smaller I'm a blending brush I'm going
to use this to go a little bit more into
my crease and not go above that first
shade that we put on then I'm going to
go in with this super deep shade right
here and focus this more on the outer
half we're still really blending it in
there then what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to take this brown and
then Natasha Genova palette and go back
in and top it off a little bit more we
get a little bit deeper now I'm going to
take the Too Faced glitter glue so it's
the back of my hand so I'm just going to
take this one from Mac this is the 239 I
would prefer the I think it's the 217 no
not 217 I came out with it I'm going to
go in with it to save glitter glue pack
this on in the inner corner here just
kind of let go - well if you guys just
probably seen it a few toriel's because
I love doing this I love making my inner
corner kind of bright and then I'm going
to go in with a glitter
I'm going to go in with baseline she's
pretty I'm just going to Pat this on
look at that
oh maybe kind of careful since this
brush is thicker okay so now I'm going
to go back and I'm going to take this
dark brown with a small blending brush
again I'm just going to lightly start
here and blend the edges of it
just so we get like more of a faded look
okay the next thing I'm going to do for
this side is I'm going to take the tape
off sharp line and I'm going to take my
favorite matte eyeliner this is me
makeup for ever matte liquid liner and
I'm just going to do a winged liner for
my Instagram side
okay so for the Instagram side I'm going
to use these lashes from eyelure there
is the lux gilded lashes these are
amazing
okay so Walters lashes dry I'm gonna
move on to state and I like to use my
same primers that I know work really
well just so my face makeup lasts a long
time throughout the day so I'm going to
use my Smashbox primer water for both
sides and then on top of it I will put
my cane and Austin and mattifying primer
on has SPF 50 - I love this stuff
case I'm going to use two different
foundations for each on my face now for
my everyday makeup sign I am gonna use
me wet and wild
so to focus foundation I really do like
this I think it's awesome it's
affordable then for my Instagram side a
I'm going to use my feelin Styles matte
finish foundation because I'd love this
in photos as well so this looks really
great in photos also especially if
you're really using flash but if I'm
doing more of a day-to-day makeup look
then I'm going to use more of an
affordable foundation so I didn't use up
all my high-end so I'm going to mix
desert beige and a little bit of golden
beige as well this slide this is pretty
dark touch of golden beige I just did a
forward view on this by the way so if
you want your cut out I will put a card
in the video and also leave it down
below so I'm just going to one I don't
so you can see this still has coverage
which is what I like if I'm going to
wear makeup no matter if it's Instagram
or real life I'm going to wear something
that is going to cover my redness you
know what I mean because otherwise I
wouldn't wear makeup if I don't want to
cover it and now on this side I'm going
to use the Fiona Stiles matte foundation
in Oh 5 I need to get more shades of
this but I really like this one this one
is great for when I've just dealt and
hopefully these colors aren't too all so
I'm going to kind of look a little off
right now I'm looking below II from my
skincare today I did a mask that was
like a hydrating mask so I am glowy
next up we're going to do a concealer
and on my everyday side I'm going to use
a more affordable option which is the
Maybelline butter skin on the other side
when I want more full coverage finish I
will use this heart-shaped cake with
this I use these two in my wet long
videos because I was going into a
meeting and I went in warm full coverage
finish whenever I combined these two I
just use the Tarte shape tape here in
the inner corner to cover
darkness and on my nose is it really
locked in and stays on my nose and then
I'll take the better skin and just put
the rest of it like that on my face to
highlight and then I do desire my
forehead with the better skin on both
sides so then I'm going to take the
Loreal sponge and I'm going to build out
this side first even when I do realize
makeup I really do focus on my
foundation just like my base I want a
good-looking base and then my eyes I
could really care less about so that's
why I still kind of do the same
technique with concealer like taking it
in a triangle underneath my eyes and all
that I still want it to look good and be
that highlight contour just was more
affordable product of course for your
real-life makeup you don't have to use
this much concealer but personal
preference makeup washes off I'm going
to take just brush from Kat Von D get
right in the inner corner right here
since I can't go over my eyelids really
quick I'm going to apply the false
lashes okay now my dark false lash on
I'm going to let that glue dry and then
we'll go in and touch us our liner alibi
looks so weird looking out at you guys
and I see lashes the Sun adult is so
weird okay so what I've been doing a lot
lately is taking this wet and wild
cushion contour I've been obsessed with
this you guys are you thinking it's so
good I've been applying this in both my
real eyes and my Instagram side so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take
this anyway dual ended brush and it has
a little dome shaped right here you can
get these brushes at CVS and just let me
dip it in here and four on the line just
is that for to my real life side I'm
just going to lightly contour my cheeks
you see that I'm barely touching my face
I've been doing this recently on my real
life side because this way I could put
powder all over my face and set the rest
of my face but I don't have to add more
contour on top of course for the
Instagram side I do those do the same
thing on the other side of my face but
on this side we'll set it with a contour
powder after we've picked our face and
everything but that just so good doesn't
like oh my gosh okay and now it's time
to set and modify the face so I'm going
to use the same product on both sides it
is the flower beauty powder and lo1 I
just love this stuff you can get it at
mark I've already gone through one whole
thing is if I even bake the real live
side because I'm oily and I like to make
sure everything is locked in it doesn't
matter from running errands going for a
lighter look for a date night at always
fake choice so going in with brows I've
everything to use the work with my brows
is upon me just because I find it easier
I feel like even starting out with brows
I think Palmes are just so much easier
than pencils and once I really got used
to my pomade I just feel like it's so
much easier so all I'm going to do I
fill in my brows the same exact way I
always just give them a little bit more
fullness the top extend them out just a
little bit kind of go back in here my
eyebrows are honestly number twins
they're always like I hate each other
okay and then what I've been using to
set my brows recently there's no rhyme
or reason to this it's just something
I've been using I've just seen it and I
needed to you know use it up the to face
to brow quickie brush on brow fiber
cream one thing I used to do to this
side of my face is I used to use like
the benefit gimme brow but I for the
past week I don't know if it's been like
a year or two years I've had a problem
with where when I get stressed I pick my
eyebrows with my fingers but I will
pluck with my fingers hairs in my
eyebrows because I'm stressed I feel
like when I use the gimme brow just
doesn't do it justice but I use it a
little bit lighter too and adds a little
more fullness to the brow and then well
do one more time is just run through it
with Louie I'm going to dust away the
bake I'm going to take this essence to
shape your face palette and I'm going to
use that same brush that we did use and
put it in the dark color sheer and just
kind of lightly go in here and carve it
out a little bit more with that you can
see like this one has just a little bit
more definition but you still see a
contour on this side then for both sides
I'm going to use the Maybelline master
blush Studio I just love blushes this
color so I'm just going to use this
color blush to put on my cheek so they
just tell it lightly and I really like
it
this brush is terrible remember why I
don't use that side that brush I try to
go extra light-handed on this side if we
have a strike now coming up brush once
now I will use highlighter on both sides
as well just because I like highlighter
a lot so I'm going to use wet and wild
precious petals highlighter I'm going to
go a little extra on this side because
obviously it's the instagrams side then
on this side I'll just kind of just a
little bit besides definitely much more
intense than the Sun and then the next
thing I'm going to do is I am going to
take that same bronzer that we use so
I'm going to use a fluffy blending brush
I'm just going to buff this into the
crease just a little bit of definition
this just adds a little bit of something
I just think I like to do I like to do
it on both sides as well because even if
you're not wearing false lashes and make
sure natural lashes with a lot thicker
and that is - oh hello that is to align
the upper waterline on each eye now you
can see right here or I haven't lined it
so I'm going to do that now this is like
the ugly face that I make sooner not
your thing you do it I'm saying is that
same went wild mascara because I've just
been loving it recently and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to finish
up the lower lash line on this side so
I'm again going to take that eyeliner
I'm going to use the deepest color in
the japonesque palette and we're going
to push this up against that lower lash
line and we're going to kind of wiggle
it right down it
I do connect it to my wing and then
we're going to go in with a pencil brush
and I want to take this tone right here
we're going to blend out the edges of
that to finish off the lower lashes I'm
going to take this wet-and-wild skinny
mascara I saw you would think I was
sponsored by went well because it how
much should I use from them by swear I'm
not and then really quickly a mess fix
the liner on the top for both sides of
any of the same lip liner just because
it's a good neutral liner a lot of times
I'll wear a lip liner that doesn't match
lip color especially if it's just like a
neutral shade so I just like to same one
this is the wet and wild filled up liner
in Bair's comment this is such a smooth
lipliner okay so for my lips i've been
loving two different kinds of lip color
so for inside my face i like a lighter
nude and for the deeper side I usually
like a darker nude so I'm going to use
obey this is by pur cosmetics it's their
Velvet Matte lip color looks like dude
so pretty and I'm going to put this on
my lighter side
this actually matches that like lipliner
perfectly and then on this side I'm
going to use the shade in a sense which
is a little bit more of a deeper nude
okay it's a lot deeper sometimes when I
do lip colors like this - I'll do like a
ombre and I'll put something like this
in the center of this and make it really
um braids and pretty okay guys so that
is this video I hope you enjoyed it I
think it's super fun to like see how
different it looks like side by side
I've never really looked at it before
but it's interesting to see the size and
see how different they are and just keep
in mind
makeup is fun I think you should totally
have fun with it I think it's you know
it's something that you wash off at the
end of the night so it really doesn't
matter just have fun I'm just I really
like I'm diggin Instagram so I like I
wish I'd do my whole face like this
right now I hope you enjoyed it don't
forget to give a thumbs up if you did
like it and subscribe and I'll see you
all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
