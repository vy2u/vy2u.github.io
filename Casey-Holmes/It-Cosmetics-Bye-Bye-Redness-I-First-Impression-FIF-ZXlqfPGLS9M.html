a first impression on the it cosmetics
by by redness I've had so many of you
guys requests for me to do this and I
wanted to pick it up a canvas see this
is $32 it's pretty pricey
you only have 0.37 fluid ounces in it
you don't get an ounce or anything like
that I know so if you would like to use
this as foundation it says it's a
neutralizing correcting cream I don't
take it as it is a foundation I mean if
you wanted to you could I'm going to
read to you real quick what it says here
on the side the reason why it cosmetics
created this product is to truly cover
redness and correct it without having to
use a red or yellow product that still
requires makeup over the top it
cosmetics infused and micronized red
canceling pigments into a concealer
cream that also that's also infused with
anti-aging skin loving benefits so
basically is supposed to really help
counter crack that redness you know I
don't want to put like green on top or
anything like that and I've been really
interested in it I just find that it's
really pricey and if I use this it's
probably going to be something that I
would use under my foundation now it
does come in only one shades it's kind
of a tan color let's see if I can get
this off without putting it all over
myself so it is kind of like a tan shade
maybe akiza under your foundation I
don't know but we're going to see how
well this covers up my redness I am
gonna just use my fingers to apply it I
don't know how they say to apply it but
I'm just going to use my fingers just
because that seems the best and yeah
we're just going to say this really
helps I don't think I'm going to do an
update throughout the day what I'm going
to do is I'm going to apply it we're
going to kind of see the difference in
the redness without any foundation on
and then we're going to see if we could
put the foundation on top and it still
look really nice or if we could use less
foundation stuff like that and then I'll
let you guys know what I kind of think
of it at the end of the video so this is
my skin up close you can see they do
have rosacea mainly right in here my
nose right here in the center of my
forehead and down here on my chin um
I've had this for a really long time so
it's nothing new to me and I usually
just use a full coverage foundation to
cover it up it's not
think I'm embarrassed about I mean it's
just skin but you know when I do put
foundation on and stuff I want to make
sure all the redness is covered up
because I don't want it to distract from
other things on my face you know what I
mean so I like for Morales to be
completely covered if I'm using makeup
so this is what the little it cosmetics
thing looks like and I'm just going to
take some on my finger and it does look
a lot put it on the back of my hand I'm
just going to see how this works okay
let's just start applying this and you
don't need a lot of this stuff maybe a
brush is the best way to do it I just
like a brush it kind of feels a little
bit more dry um so it might be good for
oily skin it doesn't feel moisturizing
at all did cover up that redness pretty
well I can kind of see a little bit
through but I mean it looks good it's
just correcting it we're going to do
half of the face I'm not putting this
all over I'm just putting it where I
have redness which is obviously the
center of my face you're on top of my
lip have a little bit here my nose as
well put some down the side of my nose
house a lot oops
so you can see the difference that it
has in the face so far I'm liking it I
think it looks really nice if I wanted
to do like a natural look one day I
would totally plop this on and put like
a BB cream on top that doesn't have that
grade of coverage so this would be
really nice to have to just apply a head
and then go throughout the day or just
apply and I have any other makeup on
just this stuff so you can see I put
that on my redness kind of blending it
and I kind of have like little spots
over here as well so I'm just going to
put some over here to see the covers of
that did alright just have like little
acne marks and redness right in here
okay so this is what it looks like with
it done on this side and not on this
side you can see all the redness rosacea
everything over here and then you have
over here which doesn't look like it has
a lot of redness on it I think it does
look really good I think it does
counteract the redness very very well um
I'm excited to see how the foundation is
gonna look like my foundation is gonna
look over this because it is pretty
light and be way too light for me to
wear as a foundation but I do like it I
think it looks really really good and I
think you had severe redness you would
like this as well and you would want to
probably press it in more because I feel
like when you move products like this
around like that it kind of just moves
the product all over but if you really
pressing it in the skin you have really
severe redness it will help cover it up
even more now we're going to go ahead
and do this to the other side and I kind
of like dotting it on my face and then
blending it out just what I'm preferring
right now even with like regular
foundation I mainly focus it on the
center of my face because I don't really
have any products like this that I used
for redness and I never liked the whole
green concealer thing because it didn't
work for me but this is working pretty
nicely
if you are lighter you could probably
use this as a foundation this is really
nice and it seems really mattifying so I
like that and that just like my actual
skin tone but not my self tan okay so
that is it with the stuff on I like it
it's very natural I think it does cover
the redness really really well and I
think it looks really nice I don't have
like a crazy breakout that I could
really test it on you know rosacea is
pretty intense though so I'm not not a
lot of things can cover it unless you go
to like a full coverage foundation but I
feel like if you wanted to wear a
lighter foundation but you wanted your
redness to really be covered up this
would be the way to go I like it so far
so I'm going to take my Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation and we're going
to see if we can put foundation over top
of this I'm going to use a Beauty
Blender because I don't want to use a
brush to smear it all around so I'm
going to use that today I'm just going
to even out the skin doesn't look like
on camera it's much darker but it is oh
what did I get foundation in my hair so
so far it looks like it's totally fine
for you to put foundation over top of it
so if you're a much tanner and you have
that redness you could totally do this
because it looks really nice it doesn't
look cakey or anything like that okay so
that is it with the foundation over top
of the by my redness and I like it I
think it looks great it doesn't look
cakey I kind of feel like this is
definitely more oily skin like I said
but what I'm gonna do is do the rest of
my face makeup and I'll be back to give
you guys a conclusion on me by my
redness okay so I've done my complete
face makeup if you want to see a
tutorial on this look I will leave the
video down below because I just did it
yesterday so far I have to say I really
do love this I was thinking that it was
going to be more on the super greasy
kind of side I thought it was just gonna
be really greasy that's just what I
thought but I feel like this is great
for oily skin I've seen a lot of people
with dry skin
and loved it and you know I guess it
just works for everybody if you have
really dry skin and you tried this let
me know what you think of it like I'm
talking really dry skin it just it
doesn't feel really greasy or anything
like that and it doesn't feel very
hydrating at least I don't think so it
covered up my redness really well and my
foundation I didn't have to use as much
which is awesome even though honestly
with the Estee Lauder I don't have to
use that much anyways but it's even
better if I can use less than when I was
already using so I love that and of
course I applied it with the Beauty
Blender and I think the best way to
apply this is with a brush it just like
sinks into the skin really quickly so if
you just use a brush to kind of stipple
it in it works perfectly and I really do
like this I think I'm going to be using
this all the time now before my
foundation just to make sure that
redness is completely covered up because
as you guys saw in my before-and-after
it was just completely gone it looked
really really really nice and it looked
very natural as well so I do like that
didn't look like I was wearing any
foundation or any like concealer type
things on my skin
so I love this I definitely think it's
worth the 30 some odd dollars I didn't
use that much of it today and like I
said I'm not using this as foundation
just using it to counteract that redness
and I think this will last me quite a
long time so that is my complete review
and first impression on the it cosmetics
bye bye redness if you found it helpful
