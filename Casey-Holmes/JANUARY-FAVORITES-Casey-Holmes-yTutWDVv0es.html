oh my green tea really quickly I want to
mention this NYX I forgot what it was
called for a second hey guys so today's
video is going to be a my January
favorites and I have a ton of stuff to
show you because they didn't do a
December favorites I just did a yearly
favorites which if you guys didn't see
that I only get two down below for you
but I have a lot of stuff to show you
guys and it's it's gonna be a minute but
I love all of these products so much I
highly recommend them and if you guys
can tell by my background it's getting
more and more sparse as the days go on
it's signed to buy the house yesterday
and I'm moving on Friday so I'm trying
to pre film some videos of a film and
holds a haul after this one but I'm just
pre filming videos so I can have some
stuff up for you guys but I'm moving
Friday and I am vlogging actually I have
a vlog the past two days I haven't put
them together or anything I'm gonna
combine them I don't know if I'm gonna
combine them as in like a week's worth
of vlogs or just like a couple days
worth so I have been vlogging so just
stay tuned so I'll leave my vlog channel
name down below if it's still active I'm
pretty sure it's selective but I'll
leave it down below the first eyeshadow
palette I want to mention to you guys is
this Too Faced - semi-sweet chocolate
bar palette I love this palette look way
more than the first chocolate bar
palette because it's a little bit more
warm I'm a sucker for warm eyeshadows
and these are perfect right when I
opened this palette I knew what peanut
butter was gonna be my main be and it is
I love this so much and there's just
such gorgeous colors in here I've used
almost all of them and I love it because
you can do so many looks with this
palette I have seen that some people say
that this was a pigmented but I have an
issue with who mutation whatsoever and
I'm very picky about that so
I look oh my gosh I just cracked my
black shadow I guess I need to be more
careful with it the next I shadow this
isn't really like a palette but I have a
deep palate full of them
this is makeup geek eyeshadows and I
just got on this train and not too long
ago and I love these makeup geek
eyeshadows I got hounded in my last
affordable slash drugstore makeup
tutorial because I used in these shadows
but these shadows are more affordable
they're about five dollars apiece unless
you wanted the fold I shadowed these are
about ten so it's a little bit more
pricey but these are about five dollars
apiece which is a good deal because
they're very pigmented super buttery and
they're going to blend very very well so
very hard to find eyeshadows in the
drugstore that do what these eyeshadows
do so these are more affordable I love
them and I think they're beautiful so I
will have a lot more tutorials coming
for you guys you can see most of them
are warm shades love this great great
shadows I used a Korean stand in my last
videos if you want to check that out I
will link it down below
next up are shadows from the makeup
forever
I have been loving these so much and the
main ones that I've used are this one
that looks like it got completely
butchered because it did I dropped it on
the floor and Lily was gone she took it
and she was outdoor don't worry I
sprayed it though with alcohol but this
is the eye shadow I love this I had it
on my Instagram not too long ago but I
was using this with the Mac Pro
eyeshadow in fashion fix so it was
really nice cool to an eye I loved it
I'm gonna probably do a tutorial for you
guys soon but I loved this these two
together were so beautiful and then the
other one that I've been loving and I
haven't done a video on because I know
if I film if people are going to be like
you've already done this like a million
times but I love it it's the oh by the
way this color was one 300 and this one
is one 648 so it's a really pretty like
gold champagne color and I love this so
much to go all over the lid it looks
beautiful
I'll use the Too Faced - palette to kind
of warm it up with some warmer shadows
and I just love it so let me show you a
swatch of this 1301 real quick look at
that so beautiful
I love these shows okay and then the
last pallet is what I use for my
eyeshadows today if you guys do want a
tutorial on this look let me know I just
wanted to kind of play around with color
and some different products so I used
the morphe Jaclyn hill palette and I
really do love this palette I love the
color selection and I just think it's
really great I have the other morphe
palettes but I feel like this one has a
better pigmentation and I just I don't
know I love all the color they're very
warm and I know Jacqueline loves her
warm shadows so I saw this and I ended
up really really loving it I love the
green I love the oranges I love me some
oranges they're my favorite love the
purples I just it's a all around a
really great palette and very very
pigmented like I said so I used on my
eyes today so highly recommend it it's
beautiful and it's I think it's pretty
affordable as well okay now we are
moving on to bronzers the first one wait
a second I got the wrong one
so the first bronze are caught well this
is a contour shade I'm using this is a
NYX blush in taupe I love this I got
this off of cherry culture comp a while
back and it's just a really nice
Ashley blush but this is great to
contour with it just creates a really
nice shadow underneath the cheekbone and
I I just I love it so that's it right
there I've never been able to find it in
store like an altar anything but you
could probably find it online an altar
or something but I got mine from cherry
culture calm and then this is the same
kind of thing but just from Mac it's the
Mac mouth this is Maleficent in a sculpt
this is just their sculpting powder in
sculpt but I got it when they had a
little collection out and it's pretty
much the same exact color it's a little
bit more warm than the next one just a
tiny bit more warm cuz this is that one
and this is the next one you can see the
next one is more cool but they both
create a really nice shadow underneath
the cheekbones so if you feel like this
is a little too cool tone for you I
would definitely try sculpt from that
and then for bronzer I have been loving
this BH Cosmetics braum bombshell
bronzer in the color diva and it's just
a really nice warm
toned bronzer I like it a lot
and it blends really well it's a nice
pigmented bronzer right there as you can
see just really beautiful I've just been
going through it a lot and then a
high-end one I've also been going to I
got this I think in January I think it's
beginning or something this is the girl
on Terra Cotta bronzer in number five oh
my god it's so pretty so it's very
warrants a very very very very very warm
bronzer you can look orange with this in
an instant but I love this if you just
use a light hand with it I just use this
matte kabuki I got this from a CCO of
had a ton of people ask me about this
brush but I got in from CCO back in the
summertime of last year so I don't know
if they still have it but you can use
any kabuki honestly but I just use it
with this and just put it on the top of
my forehead cheeks and my jaw and I love
it and but I'm not kidding when I say
can make you really Orange so that's it
right there
but it's so it blends so so so well and
I just I love the color that it gives
and if I'm feeling like I'm looking a
little pale well I should put some of
this on and it looks gorgeous really
quickly I want to mention this makes the
conceal correct palette I've mentioned
before in my haul or something that this
is a great dupe for the Mac Pro and
conceal palette it's literally the exact
same concept as that but I just really
love this a lot of course I'm using me
more yellow signs for my skin when I'm
self-tanning and I just really really
like it it's a really thick concealer it
covers up a lot covers up redness really
well and it's also great it like carving
out your eyebrows and things like that
and I just I think this is a great
palette and mix hit this one on the head
it's beautiful so definitely check this
one out if you've been looking at the
Mac Pro conceal I would just pick this
one up and just use this one cuz it's
awesome okay moving on to eyebrows if
you've been watching the my last few
videos you've seen this guy pop up a lot
this is the NYX eyebrow gel in the color
chocolate it's more of like an ashy
brown color but I really love it it's
easy to work with but it does kind of
quickly so you know you kind of want to
work fast with it but I never feel like
I put too much on with this product I
just I love it I can build it up and it
looks beautiful even though it is a dark
shade it doesn't like make my eyebrows
with like sharp easy you know and it
lasts all day and when it dries it dries
to that gel finish so you don't even
have to set it with a brown gel if you
don't want to it's kind of like an
all-in-one product but I love this a lot
having my brows now and a little bit
does go a very very long way next up I
want to talk about this Make Up For Ever
eyeliner I have been loving makeup for
ever did to me some stuff in December or
the beginning of January and this was
one of the products this is the makeup
for ever matte liquid liner and I love
this love it like love it there has
never been an eyeliner that I have found
this like this it dries so Matt and I
believe I heard Jacqueline talk about
this too but it dries really really
matte it's so black look at that and I'm
telling you this thing doesn't budge and
I also love the tip on this you can see
it's really nice and pointed so it's
easy just to line your eyes and get a
nice winged out liner I love this look
dry it dries fairly quickly too
but that's it right there nice and matte
look at that it is so gorgeous
best eyeliner I have tried I will
definitely be repurchasing this when I
use it up because it's the Holy Grail
the Holy Grail that's amazing
I also want to mention this brow product
as well forgot to mention it with that
next one this is a Loreal brow stylist
plumper at the brow gel mascara I love
this because it reminds me of the
benefit gimme brow what color is this
this is in medium to dark this kinda
reminds me of the benefit gimme brow it
has more of a small wand right here see
if I could swatch the color for you but
that's the color right there and I just
like this for days that I don't want to
wear a lot of makeup and I don't want to
wear you know a lot of brow products
I'll just run this through my brows and
it kind of just enhances them makes them
look a little bit fuller without being
overdone and looking like I have a lot
of makeup on you don't I mean so I love
this I've been using more than my
perfect product and I love it I've also
been using it Deloria for you oh you
guys what was wrong with me what is
wrong I think I'm just like I have so
many things on my brain I cannot cross
this life
I can't cross this life this is the
Lancome oh are you ready for the but
Jiang get your butcher knife out because
I'm about to butcher the heck out of
this it's the tint Idol ultra 24-hour
makeup but this is awesome
this isn't the shade up and wearing
actually have samples that I've been
using that are what I've been wearing
but I love this product it lasts all day
and with this primer which I've also
been loving is the number 7 primer it's
a mattifying one you can get this from
Target these two together you will not
be shining it all and this lasts so long
on my skin sometimes when I wear a
sailor wear water wear sometimes when I
wear it estee lauder double I think
we're good now sometimes when I wear
Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation and
if I wear overnight you know it just
happens sometimes it will wear off on
the sides of my cheeks
this one doesn't wear off and I don't
remember touching this up at all with
this primer these two together are
awesome I love them this primer isn't
it's my tip to you for this primer if
you are using it it's very very math you
have any sort of dryness on your face I
do not recommend this primer at all what
I do is I put it in my fingers and I
start rubbing it as fast as possible for
like literally two seconds and then I
press it into the skin because if I keep
rubbing it it just kind of pulls up the
skin and then creates like these little
white flakes you want to focus more on
pressing it into the problem areas that
you're having where ever you're getting
oily put this primer there and I swear
to you you will stay mad for ever
it's it's intense but if you don't apply
it right you're gonna hate it
so make sure you're just pressing it in
to that skin and you will love it and
it's also hypoallergenic which is
amazing so the first lip product I want
to talk about is by Kat Von D now I lost
it my lolita liquid lipstick which I am
NOT happy about I remember one day
putting it in a door
I don't know where I put it but I'm not
happy about losing it because lord knows
it's been sold out forever but I ended
up getting this lipstick a while back
and I just started using it and I love
it
this is called Lolita it's her what are
these called I did kiss lipsticks which
they have really cute packaging it's
just a nice studded packaging and this
is Lolita it is not the same color as
the liquid lipstick let me just go ahead
and say that it's a completely different
shade definitely more on the pinky rose
side but I do like it I like it a lot I
think it's really really beautiful and I
like to pair this with by beauty's lip
gloss in rambutan which is a gorgeous
nude color I think I've mentioned
rand-new tan before but this is where
I'll top it off with and it just gives a
nice kind of rosy nude color I like it
it's very very beautiful but just keep
in mind this low deal this lowly is
completely a different color than the
liquid lipstick Lolita let's just
continue with the lip gloss I have been
loving this bite Beauty lip gloss in
Coco I'm in love with the Coco is it
beautiful
it's a gorgeous literally a Coco shade
like a like hot chocolate that's the
color that it is that's it right there
these are very pigmented and they're
really smooth on the lips I don't really
care about lip glosses me and sticky or
not sticking out that I really don't
care
these are at a bit sticky but not much
at all but Coco has to be one of my
favorite lip glosses I would love to
pair this one with my lime crime
lipstick that I'm not show you I think
it would be a beautiful combo but yeah
these by beauty glosses are where it's
at and I love them one more by beauty
product this is in the color glace this
is the matte cream lip crayon and I love
this so much so so so much that is place
right there's a gorgeous involved with a
little bit of brown in it very creamy
and I love the packaging of this - it's
just really nice and easy to carry
around in your purse and I just love us
a lot it lasts for a really long time
it's the last lipstick is this one by
Mac and this is in the shade Verve I've
never heard of anybody talk about this
and I just saw it online and decided to
pick it up and I loved it and it is just
beautiful you guys it's
super super pigmented it is a satin
finish that is a verb right there it's
definitely a mommy brown but more Brown
than mom I love this color I love colors
like this this is my thing
Brown colors anything like that I have
it on right now it with lime crimes
Kashmir I put Kashmir all over which
Kashmir is definitely more of a gray
that's it
right there it's a very very beautiful
color but it comes off like a little bit
dead on the lips so the live ended up I
put Verve on the outer halves and also
around my lip line just to kind of
deepen it up and give it more ombre look
and it's like the perfect combo I love
these two together so much I really love
Verve by itself it's really beautiful
with just a natural eye I did like a
winged liner and lashes and then this
lipstick and it looks really beautiful
okay only a couple more beauty products
to show you literally just two more
things this is the D or capture total
dreams skin perfect skin creator that's
a lot this is what it looks like this
was a recommendation from a subscriber
it took me a couple times to get it
right but I got the right one
and I love this y'all it is very
expensive but skincare is something that
I will spend the money on because I do
have sensitive skin have rosacea all
that other stuff you've heard me talk
about before and this is beautiful I put
it on right after I get on the shower
and before I put on any moisturizer I
put it on it's just so soft and
luxurious and it feels amazing and it
really does tone down the redness in my
skin it doesn't like tone out all of it
but it really really helps calm
everything down so I haven't noticed a
big difference or pores or anything like
that but with the redness I have noticed
a really big difference with it and I
feel like you guys have too because
you've been complimenting me more on my
skin and I have been using this and
absolutely loving it and then for hair
product this month I will be having my
hair care routine coming to you either I
think it's gonna be next week because I
have one more video to get up for you
this week I think after this one so this
is the living proof style lab instant
texture mist and I love this product
this is more this is the example size
I'm definitely gonna get the full size
whenever I run out but it is
thicker consistency and I love this it
smells really good
oh it just smells like the salon you
know so like whenever I curl my hair and
brush through it I will just spray this
kind of like all over and run my fingers
through it and it kind of makes it more
PC and not so perfect looking if that
makes any sense it doesn't look so put
together and that's what I love about it
and it lasts all day and what I love is
I can still brush my hair like I mean
you don't go crazy with it but if I mess
up a certain area I can still wear my
brush through it and it looks fine even
the next day it looks really really good
so I love this I'll definitely purchase
the full size and then for fragrance
this has been an all time favorite of
mine this month and at the end of
December because it was a gift
this is eat by Burberry perfume and oh
if you're not careful this will be like
who really intense and strong but I love
this I have no idea what it smells like
it just smells really mature and sexy
and feminine this is like a date night
perfume I love this I'm not going on any
dates unless it involves pizza but this
is like a date night perfume and it's so
gorgeous I love the bottle and it smell
lasts a really really long time I just
oh I forgot to mention these lashes
really quickly these are the Carlie lash
from velour I posted about these on my
Instagram because I love them and that
was the first time we using them they
were they like blew me away so these are
the lashes that Carli bybel paired up
with the Lord to make they're so
stinking pretty like these are sexy
lashes they will make your eyes look so
flirty and feminine and they're really I
love lashes that are intense and really
fluffy like this and these are just
perfect I'm actually gonna order back
ups I did purchase these myself
and these are just beautiful I'm not
kidding they're absolutely stunning and
you need these lashes in your life like
now it is time for the fun part which is
music but I feel so so for music I
didn't do a music favorites for my
yearly favorites and I kind of felt out
of place I was like I'm really sad that
I didn't put music favorites in this but

got a lot of music to talk about so sit
back and be ready and if you don't like
me lip-synching to my favorite songs

favorite song right now if I want to get
pumped up this is the song I listen to
