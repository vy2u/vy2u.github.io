be sharing with you my January hits and
misses we actually don't have too many
hits I do have a few things but not too
much and I do have some misses for you
guys so I'm really excited to share them
with you today these are my favorite
videos to film and I do have more videos
coming for you I promise I have a
drugstore Valentine's Day look that I
want to do I also want to do like a full
face of first impressions because
there's been so much makeup that has
come out that my drawers are full I'm
also gonna share with you guys my music
favorite why do you wanted to see like a
yearly music favorites but if I did that
we would be here for days days if I went
through my playlist yeah I figured I
would include some of my favorite music
in here as well you know I like to do
that every month also don't forget to
let me know down below what your
favorite was for the month so I can
check it out and see if I should try out
some new product subscribe before you
leave if you're not subscribed already
and if you want to see all my hits and
misses for the month of January then
let's just go ahead and get started I
honestly don't know who I am with
straight hair my hair has gotten so long
that now I can blow-dry it and it blow
dries like this straight but I don't
like straight hair on me I just don't
like it it's flat
there's no life but I was too lazy to do
my hair today so we're just working with
straight hair today I'm gonna kind of go
through these things pretty quickly at
least my hits because I don't have too
many hits that are new I just want to
kind of touch on some things that I've
been really loving this month and then
I've been going back to first thing is
one that actually came out in December
and I mentioned this in my yearly
favorites because I got it a little bit
before December and I've been loving you
know this is the NARS natural radiant
long wear foundation this looks so
beautiful on the skin it wears really
well I would not say it's a like 24-hour
type of thing I think for me it lasts
for a good 810 hours and then it kind of
starts breaking up on my forehead it
does look really great on the skin it
doesn't accentuate pores texture it just
looks really beautiful and it has a full
coverage finish to it I just really
enjoyed this foundation it's easy to
work with
I like applying it with a Beauty Blender
also I want to mention my Real
Techniques the face and body sponge I
don't have her right now because I lost
it going from Georgia to here back to
Georgia to here I lost it somewhere
along the way but my Real Techniques
face and by sponge you guys have been
like going in on it because it's the
biggest sponge ever I need to go
purchase another one because I really
miss mine the face and body sponge from
Real Techniques is just like their
regular face sponge but it's bigger
because you can use it for your body it
gets your foundation on in no time it's
amazing if you want to check it out I'll
link a video down below where I used it
because I swear in the comments that's
all you guys talked about and I was like
is there really that noticeable then
it's like ginormous but I guess it is
I do really quickly want to shout out
the two-faced peach perfect a mattifying
loose setting powder this has become one
of my all-time favorite powders I feel
like if I feel like my foundation is
just looking a little too thick or
something this is like a magic powder
that really sinks into the skin and
makes it so smooth and seamless and it
just makes everything look so much
better on your face I swear to you this
is a great powder I love the smell of it
I mean it does taste like peaches I've
mentioned that before but I just want to
quickly shout out again this looks great
in photos I was taking a lot of photos
in January and that looked amazing and
photography so highly recommend that if
you're oily so as something else that is
new that I have not tried before I think
this is actually my first dose of colors
I shadow palette that I've ever tried
but it's the sassy siennas palette from
dose of colors and I mean when you see
it you're gonna be like well duh
of course you like it because it is all
warm tone shades and this is such a
really great palette these are very very
pigmented I will say I have them on my
eyes today but I also used a couple
shades from this Hood of Beauty rose
gold edition palette just cuz I wanted
to keep it all matte so that inner
corner shade is from this but most the
other ones are from this palette right
here these blend really well they're
super pigmented and these are just my
colors I love these kind of colors for
spring for summer for winter for fall
it's compact
super pigmented I'm very impressed with
how these blend because they are so
intense but they blend really well it's
amazing I also tried out Burt's Bees in
the month of January and I love their
blushes first of all I'm a huge
drugstore makeup kind of person I love
trying it I love finding new things
I get so much joy out of finding new
drugstore products that are amazing and
these are just phenomenal so these are
the Burt's Bees blushes we have Behr
peach and toasted cinnamon these were
with me all throughout January when I
was traveling you can see they're nice
and dirty I love it if I want more of a
bronzed look I'll go with toasted
cinnamon if I just need a peachy glow up
with this one I actually have a little
bit of the peach on right now and the
formula is really nice it's really
smooth there's an accentuate texture
it's matte so I mean these are perfect
okay and then I do want to mention the
Wet n Wild ultimate brow mascara this is
awesome it does have a tint to it I have
the shade blonder over yonder I like a
lighter brow I don't really like a
darker brow and especially right now
since I still have like lighter ends do
you like to keep more of a lighter brow
I still use like my blonde brow products
it's just my favorite so I really like
this one because it does have a tint to
it it reminds me of the honest Asya the
brow gel I used to use a while back
keeps my brow hairs in place and it also
gives them a really nice tint so I like
to apply and then I'll take a clean
spoolie and just run through it and it
gives a natural kind of tinted look adds
like little highlights to your brows and
it looks a little bit more natural
speaking of new products from went wild
I really like their brushes I did a full
video dedicated to trying these out and
I took them with me traveling once again
this month if you want to purchase these
in a bundle you can do that now I really
like them they're really soft they're
great for drugstore I don't think
there's anything wrong with them I do
think that the price is kind of high but
then I think about Real Techniques and
Real Techniques in their sets for like 4
brushes is pretty expensive just keep
that in mind but I like these brushes a
lot I think they're really pretty and
they blend everything out really well so
this month has been a very stressful
month for me I'm telling you I don't
think I've ever been this overwhelmed
and stressed in my entire life it's
really exciting I've got a lot of good
things coming for you guys and of course
I'm working on rosy days and try and
just to juggle everything that you can't
stay and everything that you are seeing
some really trying to organize my time
as best as possible so I love bats
I love lush back balms
I really have to set a good bit of time
to take a bath and a lot of times I just
don't want to do that I did I want to
take a shower and be done with it and I
bought these not long ago if you guys
saw my Ulta haul you probably saw these
and they're the aromatherapy shower
tablets these are the eucalyptus sage
and I actually have one left so I need
to go for just more I love these because
they're so menti and they just they make
you take a deep breath and enjoy your
shower just a little bit more and relax
and these are pretty affordable as well
they're just the older brands and I just
like them a lot they are very strong
very minty they last a couple showers as
well I just put them where water is
gonna hit I'm not where they're getting
like completely soaked it just kind of
fizzes when it gets a little bit wet and
it just fills the bathroom with a super
nice minty fresh scent and you breathe
it in and you're just like yes this is
what I needed so I love these if you're
stressed and you want something quick
for when you're taking a shower and you
get a little bit of like a relief this
is the way to go
highly recommend them I love them I'll
be repurchasing more of these and to go
along with that it also have been loving
this bliss hot salt scrub this also has
rosemary and eucalyptus I love
eucalyptus I think it works wonders for
me and I like to use this whenever I'm
bow shave my legs or if I'm self-tanning
and II took foliate this is what I'll
use and this is a very strong scent as
well and just really helps you relax
love it these two are my go-to as if I'm
feeling stressed pop this and shower use
this as well and then another product
that I tried out that I love is this in
RO
lust leo I say this wrong every single
time and every time I do a video talking
about it I always say I say it wrong
every single time but I never fixed
myself so I'm sorry but here you go this
is what it looks like
and this is the hydrotherapy memory
sleep mask I'm a huge fan of sleep masks
if I can just throw it on go to sleep
wake up in the morning and be fine not
have to wash it off again saving time I
love it and this is really great because
it's very very moisturizing and it's
like super moisturizing to wear I even
still kind of feel it on my skin the
next day not just the moisturized
feeling but I still have that kind of
film and I
love that and this smells like a spa it
is so good it doesn't break me out it's
kind of like a jelly as well a little
bit of this goes a long way I like to
use on my face and on my neck and chest
just because you know trying to keep
this smooth yeah I like this a lot I
find that it's really nice and soothing
and my skin just feels really great
after I use this product so now we're
going to move on to products I don't
like first thing that I tried out that I
was not a big fan of is the Maybelline
24-hour foundation this one's the super
stay one like the revamped one did a
full video showing you guys how this
wore throughout the day and personally
it just doesn't work well for my oily
skin makes me super oily shows a lot of
texture and it's just not my favorite
long wearing foundation it's just you
know it didn't work for me I used quite
a bit of it you know I tried to make it
work it just wasn't working so
unfortunately this Maybelline foundation
was a Miss for me if you did miss that
video miss miss then I will link it down
below for you to check out another thing
I did not like is the covergirl vitalist
healthy concealer this made my under
eyes look soo dressed
Oh drew you do have fine lines
underneath my eyes and I do moisturize
them really well I have a great
under-eye moisturizer but this just
brings out all the bad things that you
don't want to show with your concealer
so this just isn't my favorite shows a
lot of texture sings into those lines
and unfortunately it was just a Miss for
me and whoo right off the bat once I put
it on and blending it out I was like not
gonna work okay so like I told you guys
I tried out some Burt's Bees now this
first Burt's Bees item is just because
it's not what I like but this might be
something that you like this might be
the kind of formula you're into so just
keep that in mind when I mention it to
you this is a Burt's Bees suede splash
lippy the packaging is adorable I do
really like that I like the detail of
the color on the outside but this
formula is just not my favorite it's not
something that I feel like it's worth
spending your money on it's more of like
a sheer formula but this is why I
normally do like liquid lips because I
need my lip product to stay on all day I
can't keep going in and touching up
it's just really important for me to
have something that's gonna last and
this just didn't last on me at all it is
more like a glossy kind of balmy formula
which if you like that and you like some
pigment then you're gonna like this
product but if you want something that's
more long wearing this is definitely not
for you I would recommend passing it and
then the other Burt's Bees product is
just not good not good at all to me the
bloomin desert trio these colors are so
sheer I was very disappointed in this
palette it is just not good at all they
look pretty when you swatch them but I'm
telling you honey when you play around
with these they're just it's just not
there they're not good all kind of
shimmery the colors looked so pretty in
the pan and I thought they would have
more pigment but they're just they're
not good to work with when I tried this
out I was so disappointed in the formula
I was just a point of hut looked just
not my cup of tea
okay next up the wet and wild cushion
foundation I love wet and wild but this
was just not for me because of my skin
type I am so oily so with this product
you can build it up just a little bit
but for the most part this is a medium
foundation I do not like the way this
wore on my skin I could run my finger
like this on my face very lightly and it
would just kind of smear and move around
I think it's just because it is a
cushion foundation it's gonna be more
glowy and dewy and for me I just I
couldn't work with it you know I do like
the fact that they have like the color
on the bottom I think that's awesome it
just didn't sit well on my skin I have
oily skin I need something that's gonna
lock down stay in place this was not
that it was just it was moving it was
moving quick - so now we're gonna relax
and move on to music favorites I don't
know if I mentioned this song in my last
favorites video this song is like one of
my favorites like every time I hear it
it is just amazing so it's every little
thing by Russell Dickinson dhikr sin
it puts me in their booty shoes Alabama
it still and be like kissing me like my
last
also woman amen
by Dierks Bentley first off Turks can do
no wrong ever I always loved his music
and this song is really good so again
it's called woman amen
of course gods planned by Drake is one
of my favorites she said do you love me
I tell I only partly I only love my bed
and my mom sorry
this one the middle if I said that's a
really good song very very good song
finesse with cardi B Bruno Mars
lemon with Rihanna love it I love
Rihanna's part so that is gonna be it
for my favorites and misses for the
month of January I hope you guys enjoyed
