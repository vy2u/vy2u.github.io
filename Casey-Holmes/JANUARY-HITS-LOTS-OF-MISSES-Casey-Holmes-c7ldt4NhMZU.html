to be doing my January hits and misses I
have cut so many products to share with
you guys and I have a lot of misses
unfortunately I really really do so so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
I hope you had a great start to your
year and that your January was awesome
my January was really great really busy
it's been a great 2017 so far
also don't forget before you leave make
sure you hit that subscribe button down
below so you don't miss out on any of my
video let's just go ahead and get
started
Before we jump in I do want to share
with you guys I am wearing is the new
Urban Decay liquid lipsticks using the
Vice ones I'm wearing the shade naked
this is the first time that I'm wearing
it so I can't tell you if it's like
amazing or not just yet I think I'm
going to do a wear test video on this
you guys know I've been loving and doing
wear test instead of first impressions
because I feel like first impressions
are fun and they're really great but
sometimes your opinion changes the more
that you wear something to either hate
it and then begin to love it or love and
begin to hate it so I think I'm going to
do wear tests on these because you know
I love my liquid lipsticks so let's just
talk about foundations first I did a
full aware test on this foundation this
is a wet and wild photo focused
foundation and cream of days I love this
foundation it's like five or six dollars
super affordable I actually enjoy these
spatula as well but it just really looks
good on my oily skin and it lasts for a
really long time as well and it does
cover my redness amazingly it's about a
medium to full coverage finish and it
does have more of a satin matte kind of
finish it's not completely matte or
anything like that does have a satin
look to it and I just really love it
again I have very oily skin large pores
this is like since we've done it all it
wears beautifully I did a full wear test
if you want an in-depth review so I will
leave that down below so next up this is
no surprise to you if you haven't
watched me for a while this is the Sonia
Kashuk soft focus satin matte foundation
it is exactly what it says again really
nice ombre glass bottle I range from the
shade zero to two zero five oh five is
when I'm really self-tan and zero two is
when I'm super fair and they all match
me perfectly
they don't have a
a lot of shades in this foundation so
that does suck I feel like Sonia Kashuk
does not ever really have a good shade
range in their line if you can find your
shade I highly recommend checking this
out this does have a pump it makes you
look flawless and airbrush and I love
applying this with a Beauty Blender is
just so beautiful you guys and I never
have to blow this sometimes maybe like
once or twice I'll have to blot with
this but I never have to blow this
foundation is amazing and I highly
recommend it next step I have fallen
back in love with this foundation is the
Clinique beyond perfecting oopsies okay
another one right here
it's the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer this covers
everything now this does not have a
matte finish to it you do have to set it
but it does last all day long and I
think it has a gorgeous natural look to
the skin but it also doesn't wear badly
on oily skin so if you get oily and you
have to blot it does not look bad when
you do that you can just apply a little
extra powder and you'll be fine but you
will probably have to blow with this if
you have very oily skin like I do
especially throughout the day I feel
like the longer you wear it the better
it looks and I just still back in love
with this you guys know I used to rave
about this all the time and now I'm back
on that gravy train also think I'm going
to start a series where I try out
products I used to love kind of like
that one like Estee Lauder Double Wear
instead like that and I can't come up
with a title yet I've been trying to
think of a title to call it let me know
what you think I should call it down
below and also read some product
recommendations of course I'll go back
and look as well in my videos but let me
know down below HC alright let's talk
about sponges for a minute this one by
L'Oreal is so good I love it I do wet
mine and bring out the excess water it
gets super big I love it for concealer I
love it for foundation I just think it's
great eight dollars can't beat it well I
think that stuff's as you can see right
there that's after me washing it I don't
like my nails didn't dig into it so it's
just kind of confusing out no light
broke up like that but for me as long as
it still burns off foundations I'm good
I'm not too high - oh that kind of stuff
also been loving in this next one now
this one is a little bit more dense than
the L'Oreal one again I do have a full
in-depth review on a bunch of different
drugstore beauty blenders don't you want
to check that out there's a card right
here I love the shape of this I just
love that flat end for your eyes and
courses for your foundation there's a
little bit more stiff but it does the
job gets everything branded out and I
really like it so this is the NYX
blender for an eyeshadow palette one has
really stood out to me these past couple
months is the persona identity palette I
love this palette because it has
everything that you need in a palette at
least for me I love neutrals I stick to
my warm tones sometimes cool tones as
well and I think this has that perfect
mixture of the perfect amount of shimmer
shades and the perfect amount of matte
shades and this Brown right here the
deep dark brown is super intense but it
blends so easily so easily if you wanted
to do a really deep brown smokey eye
this is the color to go to because
you're going to be able to blend those
edges and in a good amount of time you
want to mean we're not going to be just
an hour blending out an eyeshadow have a
cream shade a transition shades a warm
color some more cool tone colors and I
really really like it and it has a
mirror so if you want to check this out
I'll leave a link for down below I am 6
munches on new papers right now I just
checked my text messages my emails and
an opportunity came up that you guys
will see I'm like a week and a half or
so that I am just over the moon about
the next thing on my series you guys is
this essence to shape your face
contouring palette I got this off of
OSes website whenever I go into ultra
and check out the essence section I
don't normally find a lot of things but
I find a ton when I go online so just
keep that in mind this is the shade
ReadySet peach I don't ever use this
blush I'll say that but I love this
contour and then this powder highlighter
or whatever you could use this to set
your under eyes you'd use this eyeshadow
or as a matte highlight if you wanted to
it's really creamy and pretty and then
this is a gorgeous cool toned bronzer
that is great to contour with I love it
it is a little more difficult to burned
out before the price I think it's worth
it I mean if you just take your time and
don't apply too much product just go in
with a light hand you'll be fine next up
is this Maybelline blush palette and
this is awesome
I love that you have different options
in here and to me I think these are very
pigmented and beautiful this highlight
shade is gorgeous as well
I forget what point was it that may
brain came out with they had a
highlighter in it whatever that is that
was before this one this highlighter is
way better than that one this is like
super pigmented I use it on the Facebook
live and I was
holy crap the show you how to use the
most out of the blush palette is this
one right here just because it goes with
everything and I love it but these two
shades are just as beautiful everything
is very pigmented go in with a light
hand and it just just going with
beautiful and you'll be able to blend it
out easily so this is the Maybelline
master blush color and highlight kit in
number 10 next up is this Wet n Wild
mega cushion contour I love this this is
in the shade cafe in Slade and I showed
you guys how to use this in my Instagram
vs. real life video and I love it it's
so great for a daytime look great for a
dramatic and nighttime look like I
showed you guys in that video it's not
too bronzy and it's not too ashy like
for me it's just the perfect shade so
what I'll do is I'll do my foundation
concealer and before I set anything I'll
put this contour on and what I'll use is
this anyway professional contour
highlight brush and I like to use this
in and just lightly fluff it into my
contour line and then I'll set my face
with whatever powder that I'm using and
if I don't want to do too much makeup
for the day I'll just leave it because
this does define the face and you can
see it it looks gorgeous but if I'm also
doing a really dramatic look I'll set it
with a contour powder make it a little
bit more intense and I just want it I do
not think I'm gonna like this product
but I love it you guys are probably
guessing all of these things that are
mentioning to you because I've used them
constantly in assessment another contour
palette everyone talked to you guys
about that I broke is this NARS Tahlia
did I mention this last month Jenna
making employment I think others I'll
think of this I really like this time I
think I mentioned it last month now that
I'm thinking about it but if you're
looking for a high-end contour palette
that is awesome
typical way to go this is the wet and
wild and mega slim is skinny mascara I
love this for my lower lashes I have it
on right now
it just flops them out but it's not too
dramatic you know what I mean like it
doesn't clump up your lower lashes or
anything like that makes them look
fluffy they're separated but they're
coated with mascara it just looks really
nice and I like the wand because it's
nice a little not necessarily little but
it's skinny and it just gets right up to
the root which is great if you're using
like a nude waterline and sometimes it
gets on your lashes at the root this is
a great way to go in and cover that up
and yeah it's affordable and everything
love it
next up is two more white wild lip
products this is the wet and while the
gel lip liner in a bear to comment I
love this I have been going through it
like crazy you see that I have a little
bit more left I mean this came with a
lot of product because I've used it
every single day and I still have a lot
left it's a very creamy lip liner as you
can see you use it as a lip color by
itself you can use it under lip gloss to
kind of keep the color all day long or
you can use the add of course with lip
liner and it's just so easy to work with
it is literally a gel lip liner it is
awesome it feels very moisturizing and
I'm very impressed by listening it was
pretty much every single lip color that
I use next up is the wet and wild mega
liquid catsuit lipstick in rebel rose
this is hands-down my favorite color out
of the line I did another full video on
this with swatches and everything that I
will link in the card and I love these I
think they last so long once this dries
down it doesn't go anywhere on me I feel
like it's a very comfortable drugstore
lipstick and I was so impressed by these
still using them still loving them I
think they're amazing so definitely
check this out in rebel rose it's my
favorite color because look at it okay
last thing I want to mention or notable
mark this this is a nose contour saver I
don't know too much about it I know JD
waiti was behind this if you don't know
JD lady 180s you should check her out on
Instagram she's like the nose contour
Queen and if you collabs to make this
brush it is life-changing for your nose
contour I'm telling you I'll just line
with the skinny part right here and now
blend it out with this little fluffy
brush but it's the perfect fluffy brush
because it's not too big at all it's
like that perfect size and it's just
pinch and I really like this it's the
last thing I mention to you guys is the
best perfume I've ever had okay that's
okay I don't know about that I mean it's
really good so my top 5 this is the YSL
Mong Perry perfume I believe and this
smells so good Oh everybody complements
me when I wear this it's such a great
girl perfume it's a little bit sweet but
not really it's just that perfect flirty
perfume that you just want to eat up you
know what I mean get a lot
compliments when I wear this and I just
am obsessed with it I last for a long
time which is great for me because I
find a lot of perfumes don't last too
long on my skin but this one does I love
it this one
why is not one beauty usually will last
on my skin for a long time so those are
the brands I like to really go for okay
hey let's get on to the message there
always is the Maybelline Dream cushion
foundation this did not look at my skin
at all like it didn't cover anything
I like the L'Oreal Christian a lot
better than this one this just did not
stay on my skin very well it would move
around even when I said it it just
looked very all I didn't like the
concealer that they had with this too so
unfortunately this is a no-go for me it
was just over an hour ago it wasn't
looking good so yeah not a big fan of
this another myth is by L'Oreal this is
the infallible total cover you guys can
check out my school video that I did
talking about this and you can see why I
don't like it I wanted to like it but it
just didn't work out so unfortunately
this was a must for me this month as
well another thing that was in this for
me is this Becca powder this is the soft
light blurring powder in golden hour and
I know it's not a translucent powder but
to me I don't know it's just I don't
know if there's other shades in this to
me I thought this is going to be a like
setting powder for my eyes and
everything because it's a blurring
powder and when I set I like to bring it
down underneath the flick you off when I
say I like to bring my powder down like
this and then normally that will help
blur out my pores and just mattify
everything this oxidize on my skin so
bad and it really looked cakey I just I
couldn't work with it another thing is
if you do bake with this it will stick
to that sticky foundation and concealer
which is good but when you try to dust
it away and blend it out it doesn't
blend out flawlessly and it you can kind
of see the line where you put everything
so not a big fan of this to me I think
you could just go ahead and buy the
flower beauty powder I think this is
just amazing I mean I can't shut the
hell up about it kind of big fan let me
know if you guys like it how you like to
use it I've tried using it as a face
powder I've tried using it to bake and
nothing works and I'm so grateful that
they sent me a PR packages a bunch of
their stuff I do love a lot of Becca
products but that one just didn't work
for me and fortunate last but certain
certainly not least we have the urban
decay be slick complexion primer
I love urban decay so it's awful awful
awful awful I did a full snapchat like
conversation about it I showed you guys
up close the problem that I had with
this doesn't matter if you moisturize
don't moisturize warm it between my
fingers put it directly on the face this
just doesn't work for me what I do with
this product is I put it directly where
I'm orderly I knew trying this out that
I was gonna have to put it where I get
oily with you right in here also I put a
little bit down here because sometimes I
get really oily there too and at first
and you put it all on your face it looks
really good it's nice and modified it is
a little bit more difficult to blend out
your foundation on top but if you just
work with it you can do it the problem
that I have with this though is like
literally an hour later there was white
marks all over my face and it it looked
really weird it kind of looks like how
white powder would look if you didn't
brush it away but that whiteness was not
going away no matter how much powder I
tried to put on top of it how much I
tried to blend it wasn't going nowhere
girl I looked a hot - Emma this is just
not my favorite I can't make this work
for me at all and I'm very oily it works
for mattifying purposes but then wants
it completely dries it just shows up on
the skin which is weird because even
when I apply foundation on top somehow
it shows through and you could just see
white areas on my face it was the
weirdest things already kay I do love
you though you know I got my love food
that is all of my menses a lot of you're
asking for some music favorites so you
know I got you obviously the very first
one and I'm assessment is Ed Sheeran
shape of you I love this song
- another what I really like is that we
don't talk anymore feature in Selena
Gomez but this is the one what do they
call this the lash remix this is good
okay another one I'm loving is issued by
Julia Michaels I post this on my
snapchat had a lot of questions I tagged
your on Instagram and when my stories
and this is such a good song I love her
voice another one I'm really loving is
don't want to know by maroon 5
I need to go to be to the song honestly
a little it's my gran I don't want no no
no no so those are all my music
favorites for the month if you have any
suggestions to actually listen to I love
all different kinds of music so you can
leave them down below in the comments so
