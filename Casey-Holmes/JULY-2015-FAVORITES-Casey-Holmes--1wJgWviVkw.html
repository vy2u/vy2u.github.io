my July favorites and I know it's been a
while since I've been on this camera and
let's pause and have a story time for
like five minutes and let me update you
because if you don't follow me on my
Twitter or Instagram you have absolutely
no idea what I've been doing so I not
haven't posted a video since last Monday
I am so sorry last Friday I found out I
was going to LA on Monday and it was a
very last-minute trip and I was like
going bananas and I had no idea what I
was gonna pack what I was gonna do I had
to find a pet sitter so I was super busy
I couldn't even free film and then I was
in LA for a week Friday when I got back
this past Friday I had plane issues and
so I didn't get my luggage until
yesterday which is Tuesday and it was
just a whole big mess but also my
boyfriend is in town and I mentioned
this in my last Q&amp;amp;A I believe um and he
is leaving on Sunday to go back to
school so I'm just spending time with
him and just trying to make the best of
what we have right now I really am so
sorry I hate leaving you guys like that
that's why I make sure I update you guys
on Twitter and Instagram so you know
what I'm doing where I'm at and I've
been making sure that I kept you guys
updated so if you don't follow me on
social media I will link them down below
in the description box but today we are
doing my July favorites and I'm so
excited about it because I have quite a
few favorites I may not have like a ton
of stuff but these things I really do
love and I have some songs for you so
let's get started
the first thing I wanna mention is kind
of random but shoes I have two pairs of
shoes the first ones are these from
Vince Camuto
I just love fringe booties and I can
even wear these into the fall time I
just I love them so again they're Vince
Camuto and they're kind of like wedges
but they're not wedges because they're a
heel but they're really really
comfortable and the fringe is just
adorable and I love them I think they
look cute with pretty much anything I
mean these are amazing
and then as most of you know I have been
working out
lately these past couple months I have
just been going crazy in the gym with my
trainer and I just really quickly want
to say thank you guys so much for all
the positive comments you sent my way
talking about how you can tell I've
toned up and how happy I look thank you
so much because one of the biggest
things that I really needed to work on
was working out and getting back to
feeling good and just feeling good about
myself and I'm I'm finally there and
it's just getting better with working
out so thank you guys so much for all of
your positive feedback I want to talk
about these shoes because I love them I
do have quite a few pairs of Nikes just
because I've collected them over the
years and I love my peen I he's just my
favorite brand today they're not
sponsoring me for this video I wish they
would but they're not but these and
Nikes are my favorite I got them before
the Nordstrom's semi-annual sale is that
what they call it I can't remember but
I'm a what card member or something so I
got to look early and I got these on
sale they're the Nike Free 5.0 the Nike
Free TR Flyknit I don't know these are
awesome
I absolutely love them so if you're
wondering where I got them from and they
get them from your drone just like look
up Nike 5.0 on Nordstrom and see if they
have them but I love this like a knitted
look at that it has I think it's really
cool and I love these for when I'm doing
weights or even squats because my feet
don't go over the sides of this shoe
sometimes I have that issue where I have
such a wide foot that it will just like
go over the sides but I don't have that
issue with these they're really really
lightweight probably should return to
the bottom but these are my favorite
workout shoes at the moment highly
highly recommend them other random thing
before we get on to the makeup is this I
did not expect like this as much as I do
but I think it's amazing it's the
Victoria's Secret bombshell a hair and a
body mist I mainly gravitated towards
this because it did say hair mist and
like I said I've been working out a lot
so I need I don't wash my hair every
single day like right now it's greasy
and I just watched it yesterday um but I
sweat so much at the gym that I'm just
like ooh usually I have my hair up in a
bun for a majority of the week
but this is great even when I have my
hair in a ponytail for the gym I can
just take it and spray it I'm
this has like some sort of oil in it
because I can see it right now
so I wouldn't put like a ton of this in
your hair because it would probably make
it really oily if you have a naturally
oily scalp as it is which I do but just
a couple sprigs in the ends just really
makes a huge difference and when I'm
working out sometimes my ponytail wit me
in the face and I'm just like so moving
on to makeup this is the main reason why
I had to wait until my luggage got here
because all my favorite maker products
where in my luggage and I was like fell
one time I don't put it in carry-on I
don't have it so this is one of my
all-time favorite palettes right now I
think it's amazing this is the elf made
form act palette so it's an all matter
neutral palette and I love this it has
warm tones cool tones it's very
pigmented I did use this in my last two
get ready talk through video so I will
leave that down below if you haven't
seen it I absolutely love the way that
the look turned out it was beautiful
these blend really well again they're
very very pigmented and I just love them
that's just from one swipe like that's
amazing so this is one of my favorite
shades as well I think it's just it's so
worth the money I've had a lot of people
ask me where I got mine and I purchased
it off the line I haven't seen them in
stores or anything but I'm pretty sure
this was like five bucks I can't quite
remember because I did make a pretty big
elf order but that palette is a
must-have you gotta have it in your life
so last month I think I mentioned to you
guys I was obsessed with Estee Lauder
Double Wear again which I love that
foundation we all know I love that
foundation I think it's beautiful but
this month I went back to the toothpaste
but Oh better than sex
no the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation I love this foundation you
guys I think it is beautiful on the skin
it looks like skin it's not as heavy as
a double wear but then again it doesn't
last as long as the dead wear but that's
not what it's intended for it's not
intended for the longevity like the
double wear has I love it right now I'm
mixing vanilla and honey just because I
have a few shades but my shade when
I'm a nice and self-tan which is not
right now I actually need to self tan is
warm and beige so every other time you
see myself tanned this is a shade that I
use and I just I love it and I love love
love it with this makeup peak foundation
stippling brush and the Beauty Blender
so my two favorite ways to apply its
foundation I just think it's so insanely
beautiful okay so the next thing I want
to quickly mention is the Becca
cosmetics the champagne pop highlighter
that Jaclyn hill did a collab with Becca
to make and I do think this is an
amazing highlighter I have seen it
everywhere and it's everywhere for a
reason because it is stunning
I really do love it it's like the
perfect shade it's just it's stunning I
think it's gonna be beautiful for any
time of the year I just love the glow
that it gives to my skin I mean you need
this highlighter in your life if you
were a highlighter junkie even if you're
not a highlighter junkie and you just
want one really good highlighter Becca
has amazing ones in the champagne one is
amazing so check that out also speaking
of new items I have been trying out this
Urban Decay brow tamer it's the flexible
hold tinted brow gel usually I use the
Anasazi brow gel in brunette I
absolutely love it having no issues with
it but I've just been trying out this
one and I really like it they are tinted
I usually use the warmer brown one but I
love the packaging of this I think it's
really sleek and pretty and it's great
for travel it's really really simple but
what I love about this is I like the
fact that it's not too strong of a hold
I do have crazy eyebrows but sometimes
when I put different brow gels on my
brows it looks a little crazy and
sometimes it gets a little flaky and
these do not do that so I highly
recommend them they're awesome again
they're the Urban Decay brow Taymor's
and there's the tinted kind they also
have a clear one as well if you don't
like tinted brow gels
I like tinted brow gels because I feel
like if you don't feel in an area as
well as you did other parts on your brow
you could put a little bit more of that
brow gel right there and it kind of
blends in together
but it's just personal preference
whatever you want to do
the most exciting part of anything this
month is these new cat Bundy liquid
lipsticks the moment I saw her post on
Instagram that she had these new colors
out I went I just went straight to
Sephora on my phone and I purchased
these so let's just talk about the
favorites my top two favorites are these
two this pink one is called melech alia
I am not too sure this is what it looks
like
I have these two right now mixed on my
lips so this is it's a darker baby pink
shade and usually I don't like these
kinds of shades but I really really
really love this one and like I said I
mixed it with this one which is called
bow and arrow which I knew I was gonna
love the moment I saw it I was like yes
if that is my kind of color I love it
because I feel like Lolita is great for
people who really want to get more into
the brown mobs that are like really bold
this one is not too bold I feel like
this is a great everyday darker nude
it's not too intense and then we have
these two which I love as well this
one's a little bit lighter so I just
used this in the center of my lips well
not right now but earlier I used it in
the center of my lips and it looked
beautiful blend it out with everything I
like mixed so many colors earlier but
this is in reclaim or equ IEM it's like
an Ashley lilac pink and then this one's
gorgeous too is called lovesick again
these all dried matte if you don't know
about these Kat Von D liquid lipsticks
they are just amazing you see this one's
like more of a darker pink I love these
liquid lipsticks I already have a few
from her and I think they're just so
amazing and these colors are stunning so
if you have not seen her new shades go
check them out right now
also for a new lip products I am so
happy Urban Decay came out with a matte
lipstick oh this is actually I'm going
to talk about the liner first this is
the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on lip pencil
in 1993 this lip pencil is so amazing
because it is it really is very very
creamy but so long wearing it's just it
feels so good on the
it's not tugging or anything so it
really helps you get that sharp line and
what I love the color
the color is just perfection and then
the lipstick 1993 is amazing as well it
is a matte shade and it matches of
course the liner but that's I love
darker nudes
and that is stunning and it is matte but
it's creamy so it's not gonna dry out
your lips like as much as we kept on D
ones and yeah it's just awesome and I
love the packaging interesting urban
decay is killing it right now
I mean I've received some new products
from them that I'm just obsessed with I
also did get this from them they did
send this to me for PR this is the urban
decay naked smoky palette I have not
used it yet if you guys have want me to
do a kind of get ready chitchat video
like I did last time with new products
but with this one let me know in the
comments and I will do that I haven't
even touched this palette it's just
sitting there waiting to be used so let
me know in the comments and I could do
maybe like a first impression
chitchat get ready video and show you
guys how I'm loving it and then really
quickly I want to mention this NYX matte
liquid liner this is awesome this is so
good I'm running out of my makeup
forever matte liquid liner and I saw
this one and I was like okay I'll give
it a shot
the only thing I don't really like about
it is the brush tip I'm not a huge brush
tip kind of person but look at how black
this is girly it's so black it looks
shiny right now but once it dries matte
I mean there is no shine whatsoever a
very great liner it's from the drugstore
you can't beat it
I love NYX I feel like NYX has been
killing it - NYX and elf have just been
prime then I really quickly want to
mention a lash glue over the weekend I
wanted to wear false lashes but of
course I didn't have my duo lash glue
because it was in my bag but I went to
Publix and pick this up because it was
the only one that they had and it's the
ardell lashes grip eyelash adhesive and
like I said I I was really nervous about
this is the clear kind which I usually
do like dark tone duo lash glue I was so
nervous about this but let me tell
you once you let this get tacky it stays
on your eyes and your lash is not going
anywhere and the clear does dry pretty
clear so I like this if you're looking
for a new lash glue definitely try this
one out I think it's so good and it
lasts for 24 months that's a long time
but that is actually all of my makeup
favorites from the month I want to show
you guys these up close that's how they
all look matte I'm just in that kind of
girl can you tell that is so beautiful
oh I love it so we're gonna go ahead and
just move on music favorites because
that's what we got left in music
favorites are my favorite parts of these
videos so I of course have to do this I
don't know if I announced this last
month or if I just made my Spotify
public after my favorites video but my
Spotify playlist is public you guys have
been going it am on my Spotify sending
me tweets and just going crazy so thank
you guys so much I'm glad you enjoy my
music taste I I take pride in music I
think music is a really big thing I have
a few new different things if you follow
me you can see when I add new songs to
my playlist my workouts workout is
probably my most used playlist and my
current favorites also so if you ever
want to know like my current favorite
songs you can just go to current
favorites and it'll show you all of them
all eyes on you by Meek Mill okay first
off meek or Drake meet or Drake let me
know in the comments who you who do you
prefer I I mean I heard back-to-back and
I was like I've always been a Drake fan
so I'm sorry meek but gotta go a drink
but this Meek Mill song all eyes on you
with Chris and Nicki is just phenomenal
so you know you know I love it
moving on um this one is called on to
something goodbye actually Monroe this
is country and I love this song
okay so this song is called strip it
down by Luke Bryan I also mentioned this
in my getting ready to talk through
video I'm so obsessed with this song you

is country but it's amazing
chairborne
oh so I've been loving 679 by Fetty WAP
I mean a little I mean obviously I've
been loving this song is just so good it
just makes me so happy when I actually
just found but I've been wearing it out
and probably in a hat next month but I
love it it is called Jordan Belfort and
it's by West Walker it's just when you

hell but it's so good just give it a few
