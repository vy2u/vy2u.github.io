you my hits and misses for the month of
July I have so many hits and I have
quite a few misses as well so I can't
wait to share them with you so the first
thing I want to talk about that is a hit
is off the shoulder tops I have been so
obsessed with them this month it is just
insane so I figured I would show you two
of the my favorite this is one I
actually just wore in my last video that
I filmed but this is from Nasty Gal I
love ones that cinch at the waist like
that it is kind of see-through so you
have to wear pasties or whatever but it
is so cute it has those long sleeves so
you can wear this into the fall and
winter if you wanted to it has this
ruffle detail which is just so pretty so
I got this one from Nasty Gal it's one
of my favorite and then this one is new
but I had to share with you guys because
it's adorable I got it from intermix and
this is what it looks like isn't it just
adorable it's wrinkled it has little
tassels all the way in the front and the
back I just love this one it's so cute
it fits so well and yeah again it is
from intermix
it is pricey I don't want to discuss
price but it is so cute on I just love
it then I want to quickly talk about
this this is kind of random but one of
the things you probably don't know about
me unless you watch some old vlogs of
mine is I get a Brazilian wax the main
reason why I do that is because I hate
shaving my bikini area I get the worst
razor burn ever like in the worst
ingrown hairs it just sucks so I began
resilient watch this since probably 2014
or so it's been a while maybe even 13 I
can't remember when I first got it done
I've been getting them done forever now
and I will not turn back but one of the
things I've been really loving is these
bliss ingrown eliminating pads even
though I do get waxes sometimes I do get
ingrown hair but this honestly has my my
bikini line look really good I'm so
shocked at it there's fifty pads in here
yeah and I've used so many I use them
every time I get out of the shower I
just take one pad and wipe it on my
bikini area and honestly you're good to
go I love it
I know Sephora I used to sell bliss but
I don't know if they still sell them now
I also love to their facial hair remover
I need to get some more of that because
I loved it for mustache because we all
go to stash let's be real
I loved it for the top of my lip because
it didn't hurt and it got all that hair
off just can't find it anymore if you're
like me and you just get ingrown hairs
really easily I would definitely
recommend this because this has
literally been a lifesaver and I swear
by it I just I love it so much the next
product I want to talk about is a candle
and I actually have diffusers as well
that go with this I really love it it's
by the brand nest this one is cedar leaf
and lavender and I also have the ocean
one ocean mist or something like that
I'll leave them down below love the
candles I mainly just really love the
sense the candles are really nice and I
do love two diffusers but I wish it just
made the whole room smell really good
like I don't know if I should buy
another diffuser to help really get that
smell to be nice and potent but let me
know that your diffuser tips down below
in the comments because I'm a new
diffuser user I'm new to diffusers so
let me know your tips and what I should
do because they're just not smelling up
the whole room like I want I just want
the whole room to smell so good so
moving on to hair care I wanted to try
something new this month as you guys
know I use high-end mostly all the time
pretty much all the time unless I'm
traveling and then I'll go in and I will
get a drugstore shampoo and conditioner
just because there's really no point if
you're traveling to have a high-end
conditioner and shampoo you know what
I'm saying like I'm not going to go buy
one I'd much rather buy drugstore but
barne reached out to me wanted me to try
their shampoo and conditioner over the
years I have used Garnier and I love
them so I knew I wanted to try these
products out so the ones that I
purchased I went to Target to get these
by the way and I got the big size this
is the Garnier Fructis fortifying
shampoo sleek and shine three-day sleek
for frizzy dry unmanageable hair and we
all know Georgia the south mmm it's
humid it's humid and gross and there's
no helping that but I really like the
shampoo and conditioner I don't wash my
hair often I wash it probably once or
twice a week I have been using this and
I love it I can always tell when a
shampoo is good because if I'm in a
shower and my hair is soft after I rinse
out the shampoo I'm like yes this is my
kind of party and that's what this does
to my hair so after I rinse out the
shampoo my hair is nice and smooth and
just I don't know when I feel the
silkiness after I shampoo my hair I just
know it's going to be a good day like
that's when I know I've got a good
shampoo so I love this this smells
amazing the same with the conditioner it
leaves your hair really nice and soft
these are very affordable I think they
were like five
six dollars at Target today it was
actually hair-washing day and I used it
and you can see it's just really shiny I
don't have any frizz going on and since
I went lighter with my hair sometimes my
hair gets a little bit more frizzy but I
didn't even take a straightener to my
hair like this is just the shampoo and
conditioner blow-dried like I don't even
know how to do a blowout I'm not that
talented and I think the reason why this
makes my hair so shiny is it does have
argan oil in it from Morocco and it also
has apricot in it so it really just
makes your hair so shiny and soft the
argan oil just does wonders argan oil is
so good for you then I've also been
putting in the sleek and shine leave-in
conditioning cream I love leave-in
conditioners like they're my favorite if
there's like a nice creamy leave-in
product from a brand I will use it
because that's just one of my favorite
things to use on my hair this is really
great because it has the same argan oil
and everything in it and it really gets
into the strands and smooths it all down
so your hair doesn't get really frizzy
throughout the day and I love the
packaging of this I don't know why but I
feel like this packaging is just so cute
I don't know but I keep this on my
little mirror where I keep all my hair
products and I'll just put probably I
would say I put about a nickel size
amount and all I do is I put it from my
ears down I never put product near my
root because my roots do get really oily
very easily so I always put product from
here down and then I also use this on
the very very ends of my hair where it's
really dry and brittle and this is the
anti-frizz serum from them as well this
is a pretty intense product I wouldn't
put this like all over your hair if
you're like me and your hair gets super
oily I would just focus this on the very
ends of your hair and you only need a
pea-sized amount like a little bit of
this stuff goes a long way and then I'll
also take just a little bit right here
around the edges of my face because
these pieces sometimes get left out so I
like to come in here and put a little
bit of that serum on my hair as well and
that's all I do it's what I did today
and I absolutely love it
I haven't had to straighten it or
anything and I've been outside running
errands before filming videos and it
just looks so good so I highly recommend
it if you're looking for more of an
affordable brand I definitely want to
try it out for you guys because I know
not everybody wants to go out and spend
$30 on a shampoo it's ridiculous I know
that and this is super convenient you
can get it at any drugstore so thanks to
Garnier for partnering with me and
letting me try these products out I
wouldn't mention these products to you
guys if I did not think that they worked
and I
use them on myself I highly recommend
them if you have a problem with frizzy
dry damaged hair that's what I've got
since I've went lighter and honestly
these are amazing next thing I quickly
want to mention is a body spray or
perfume I've been using and it's by Joe
Malone it's the peony and blush suede
scent I have purchased the body butter
of this before is a long time ago and I
loved that just because I love floral of
a peony and the roses I love it's all I
just don't want it to smell too mature
you know what I'm saying so this is like
perfect for me I don't think this lasts
forever I mean let's be real I don't I
don't think it's like a super long
wearing perfume mmm but I feel like you
could drench your body in this and it's
not too much like it just smells so good
I love it so if you love florals and
peony smells you would definitely need
to check this out okay and then I think
that is it for fashion body hair and
everything so now we're going to move on
to makeup thank for makeup that I want
to talk about that was like a standout
product to me this month is the
maybelline superstay better skin skin
transforming foundation I love this
foundation you can see I've used quite a
bit of it it just looks so beautiful on
the skin it minimizes look at your pores
it keeps you nice and matte throughout
the day the powder I don't have the
powder on me right now it's in my purse
but that's amazing with this as well
it's amazing with any foundation I love
that better skin powder it's a medium to
full coverage I love it with a Beauty
Blender I love it with a brush speaking
of brushes one of my favorite brushes to
apply it with is this it brushes for
Ulta and it's the airbrush essential
bronzer you can just blend this in so
quickly it's amazing I love this new
favorite drugstore foundation by far it
doesn't oxidize on me it doesn't rub off
throughout the day
it's very long-lasting and one of my
favorites and it has a pump you can't
beat that and then to go on with that
I've obviously been loving the better
skin concealer if you guys want to see
these two products in action and the
powder I will leave that video down
below for you guys I did a full video
showcasing these products because I love
them so much and yeah I actually went
out and bought the medium shade in the
concealer and I really like it it's full
coverage blends out very nicely and
looks great with any foundation I love
it next up is a
blush that I purchased over the month
this is the Amazonian clay 12 outer
blush in risque and I believe this is
the newest one coming out for their Fall
collection I saw a bunch of stuff online
at Ulta for Tarte and I purchased all of
it mainly like the new lip products they
had but I also purchased two blushes and
I really like this one I have it on
right now it's nothing too intense it's
just a nice pinky neutral color as you
can see right there I just love this
because it's one of those colors I can
go with any look and these 12-hour
blushes are phenomenal they last for
such a long time so this is one of my
new favorite colors I love it look at
that color it's just so pretty next up I
want to talk about a translucent setting
powder this is the Kat Von D lock-it
setting powder in translucent C you get
0.67 ounces comes in a jar like this I
think it's very pretty very sleek it's
not too in-your-face and I just really
love this powder it sets the face really
nicely it doesn't put out too much
product so I like that because it's not
too messy I love translucent powders
even if they are messy but it's nice
that this one isn't and it lasts on a
skin for such a long time and it just
really sets that concealer and it never
looks cakey so shout out to Kat Von D
because this is awesome I've also been
trying her concealer out I don't know
what I think of that yet but I will keep
you guys updated next up I want to shout
out this honest Asya Beverly Hills
Kristin lip gloss I purchased this a
while back I believe this has been a
color I've been topping over everything
I love it it's just so pretty I don't
have it on right now because I just did
a dupes video but I mean this could
possibly be a dupe the lip the product I
have on my lips could be a dupe for this
but this is what it looks like it's very
pigmented and pretty use it by itself
where you can use it on top of lipsticks
it's amazing and it lasts for such a
long time it's not sticky and it feels
really good on the lips next up we have
this essence contour powder it has a
bronzer and a highlighter and I love
this this is amazing the contour powder
is perfect it's really light you can't
even see it on my hand when I swatch it
but honestly you will see it on your
face it's one of those patters where you
have to apply it to really see that
contour and the highlight shade is
beautiful as well I really enjoy this
highlight shade I think it's gorgeous
especially for the money you can see it
right there
has a really nice Sheen to it okay so
these eyeshadows are launching August
first and they are from NARS
I love these they sent them in PR and
these are my two of favorites in the two
that I think you should have in your
life this one is in PR it's like a
silver green and this one's in earth
shine I used this one in one of my
videos it was a pizza highlighter video
and this is what I had on my eyes and I
loved it so pretty I definitely want to
film that look and then this is in a get
ready with me that you guys will see
very very soon or if you've seen it now
I don't know I have so many videos to
edit
I feel like swatching them doesn't
really do any justice they are so pretty
but once you put them on the eyes
they're even better especially if you
use fix+
I just am obsessed with them so they're
the two right there the pygar one this
silver green is going to be so pretty
for fall I used it with a deep brown lip
color and I just loved it last thing I
want to mention is this Tarte TARDIS
contour palette I've been using this a
lot but mainly for one shade and it's
the three and four shade I do like this
blush I've used it before I haven't used
these highlight shades yet but I love
this color because it's the perfect
mid-tone Brown I think it's amazing this
is a great palette to travel with you
have so many different shades and you
can do so many different things with
this you can use as eyeshadow you can
use all over your face whatever you
wanted to do I love the packaging as
well I think it's amazing with the
really big mirror the powders in here
that I've tried are so nice they're very
creamy they blend really well I think
this is great for light to medium skin
tone but if you're medium to deep skin
tones I would definitely go with the one
that make up by Shayla collabed with
Tarte to make it's like this but it is
deeper for obviously deeper skin tones
and I've heard it's amazing and just as
great as this but I love this one
your light to medium skin tone you would
definitely enjoy it and then I really
quickly want to shout my extensions I
know you guys have heard me talk about
this so much snapchat and Instagram I'm
just obsessed with the color that's what
made me go lighter with my hair this
month you guys know I take a little bit
lighter and it's my foxy locks
extensions and honey spice they are
absolutely amazing you guys know I love
foxy locks I always have a coupon code
down below in the description box if you
want to free gifts with purchase
I don't promote any other hair extension
rain because this is the extension brand
that I'm up
and then I think it's worth your money
they're very thick they last a long time
they hold a curl they just look
absolutely amazing and they're a hundred
percent worth every single penny that
you spend on them I love all the
information down below I don't have any
in my hair right now but she's just so
good
all right let's get to the mist is the
first one is this tart sponge I don't
know what is this like a shape sponge I
forget what they call this I got this I
had such high hopes for it I thought it
was going to be absolutely amazing but
this is such a dud this is such a stiff
sponge I did not enjoy applying my
concealer with it whatsoever I didn't
even enjoy baking with it it was
terrible
even when you put it under water I've
tried this wet and dry both ways are
just terrible even when you wet it it
doesn't expand or anything it's just
such a stiff sponge this just was a
no-go for me I don't like it and I don't
like the tip at the bottom I just I
don't like anything about this so sorry
tart but that was terrible this is the
revolution by makeup revolution Pro
illuminate powder and I had high hopes
for this just because I love makeup
revolution but this highlighter didn't
do anything for me it doesn't really
have that great of a sheen to it and
it's very chalky and it looks really
pretty when you swatch it yes but when
you feel it it just separates and it's
just chalk and it just doesn't blend
very well it's just one of those
products that I'm not very impressed
with so I would have to pass on this
this is a Miss for me okay so that's all
the hits and misses and now we're moving
on to my favorite part which is music
and I think I have something to show you
I can't remember but I think I have
something to show you I know oh my god
okay I love this song called catch and
release you guys it's so good one of the
main reasons why I love Spotify is like
sometimes when I'm filming like a
tutorial or something I'll just put on a
random playlist and that's when I find
some of the best songs and I'm obsessed
with this song day to day I'm buying the
sea and find how far
just something about that song it gets
into my soul and just puts me in such a
good mood so definitely check that out I
also love what they want by rest what
they want next one is mother and right
by two chains it's the remix I love this
songs like my song when I'm going to the
gym right now if I just need to get a
little groove on because I have my
pre-workout this is it
my dog is no big affair something ooh
would it really get my favorite thumbs
this one's from little boozy birds
it's called you was right something
about this song as well it just makes me
like hyped up y'all shut our Robert oh
yeah I should just home
yeah fantasy on my phone
oh yeah find a bag this is what I want
to mention to you guys the first time I
had it playing was on my snapchat and I
was showing like my protein I was using
this song is called heaven and it's by
Jake Owen it's one of my favorite songs
it's been around for a little bit but
it's such a good song I highly recommend
it if you love country if you haven't
heard it where have you been but still
check it out good
maybe see black tea in
I can take you all
I've been listening to a lot of Pandora
where it's KITT more radio on Pandora
and I love it and honestly I just cannot
get over the song magic it's just so
good it's from his while one CD and it's
just amazing maybe that was smoked in
English this is you
I know I've mentioned that song like
last year but honestly when it comes on
just like oh okay guys though I'm sorry
for the crazy ending this is terrible I
know I'm so sorry I cannot find the
footage right and this video but I hope
