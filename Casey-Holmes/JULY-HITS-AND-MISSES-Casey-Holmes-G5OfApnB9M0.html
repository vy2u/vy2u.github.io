to be doing my July hits and misses I
don't have a ton of products but I do
have some really great items right here
to share with you guys and I do have
some misses to share with you as well
we're just going to go ahead and get
started with this video if you like
these kinds of videos it definitely let
me know down below in the comments and
let me know what your favorite was for
the month you can always looking for new
products don't forget to subscribe
before you leave so you know let's just
go ahead and get started okay so the
first favorite I have to share with you
guys is this blush trio from on Sophia
this is the peachy love blush trio first
off the packaging is just gorgeous and
then the shades in here are even more
beautiful I love them so much I love
peachy blushes I just think they
complement any look so well
unless it's a cool tumbler these lend
out so well and they're so easy to use
and if you put too much on you can blend
them out they do less on the cheeks for
a long time and I just really love all
three of these shades like I'll either
mix them all together I'll use two and
two you know it just depends on my mood
if I absolutely adore this blush trio I
think it's amazing it will say if you
don't want to splurge on that this
number seven peachy velvet powder blush
is really gorgeous as well to have for a
nice peachy tone it kind of hands me up
like one shade in here but it is still
really pretty I'm wearing it right now
it's a little bit more affordable so if
you're interested I would definitely
check this out this is pretty pigmented
so you want to go in with a light hand
next up you guys have seen this a lot I
did not think I would use this as much
as I have but I've been loving it
it's the Tarte clay play palette it just
looks like this to open it up you have a
nice mirror and then there are all your
shades right there you have contour
shades eyeshadows all of that I have
just been using this so much my
favourite shade to contour in right now
is desert which is right here perfect
actually tone just looks so good I made
the cheekbone they are very pigmented
again go ahead with a really light hand
and just build it up another thing I
noticed I actually dropped this when I
was in Boston and all of the shades fell
out but none of them broke by figured
out that these are all magnetic so if
you wanted to take these out and put
them in your own palettes or whatever
you totally could but yeah they didn't
break and it chopped really hard it
dropped so hard oh so surprised since
they're talking
I chose I do want to shout this amount
because I think it is so beautiful and I
love the girl behind it she's so sweet
this is the viola boss Nicole Concilio
palace how pretty is this packaging it's
insane you have a really big mirror and
then all these shades right here it is
what I have on my eyes today I just
think it's so stunning you have some
really beautiful shimmers in here
gorgeous Max and I can do a complete eye
look with this palette I was actually
having a really rough makeup day like
I've tried building two different things
today and it just didn't work because it
was with foundations and stuff but this
is the only thing that I really enjoyed
playing with for my eyes because it was
so easy to use everything blend it so
well and they just look stunning so I
highly recommend checking out this
palette I don't think I've mentioned
this to you guys but I have been loving
the hourglass vanish stick foundation
it's what I have on my face right now I
like to wear this when I'm just self
tanned like I just put self tanner on
today I feel like I always tell you guys
that but I really I always like self tan
before ourselves sometimes that's a good
idea sometimes it's not this shade
always matches me so when I do Sultana
always know to go back to the foundation
I definitely figured that out again
today but this is the shade warm beige
it's just such a gorgeous foundation it
looks amazing on the skin I will say
since I do have oily skin I do get
pretty oily with this fairly quickly but
all I do is I just pull out with these
Palladio rice paper sheets and I'm fine
which go but it doesn't accentuate pores
and makes you look seamless and smooth
contact amendment it does last for a
really really long time as well that
stuff for makeup are these Maybelline
Color tattoo eye crumbs these are so
good I can't remember what video I used
a different eye croman but I did buy
three more shades I bought tacky cool
which I have underneath one of Nicole's
eyeshadows because I want to see how it
look this is definitely more of like a
cool toned green put Nicole's eyeshadow
on top you can see it's like a little
bit more lime there from definitely like
a cool toned green it's not as vibrant
as this right here
but it is really pigmented and pretty I
also bought the shade bronze Sheen and
beige luster you're the type that likes
to wear makeup to the beach and pool or
something I feel like you can put this
on your lid put something in the crease
and you would be fine and it would stay
all day because
see you said they're not going nowhere
they are not going anywhere so I highly
recommend these I just think they are so
beautiful I also find them easy to work
with so here the three shades I just
purchased aren't so stunning I love them
so much okay so this is definitely
leaking but it's one of my favorites so
kind of like the hell going on I closed
it I really like this cleanser this is a
drum elephant jelly cleanser so this is
what it looks like right here it says
it's a jelly cleanser that creates a
luxurious mochi lather gently and
effectively melt away all traces of
makeup debris impurities from the day
this does take off all your makeup I
even use this whenever I was taking off
my makeup but I didn't use like eye
makeup remover first I just went
straight in with it and I wash my face
twice and it took everything off
everything off it was so awesome I
really like this for some reason it is
leaking right now I don't know why
because I have it closed so this
packaging could be a fail in a way if it
doesn't stop leaking because it is
completely closed but it just like
leaked all over my desk the products on
the inside is really great and I love
drunk elephant they always have good
products great for sensitive skin though
and this is something that you guys have
been asking me about because I was
struggling with a back break out so bad
this month it was so bad that I went to
a Nordstrom to try on some clothes I
turned around to my back now I was just
embarrassed like I was there was no one
I was in the dressing room so nobody was
around me the smell like I was wearing a
backless top that day but like I just
you know how they have those like
mirrors that go all the way around I
just looked and I was like oh my god
this is like embarrassing and nobody
even can see it right now and I was
starting to feel like really
self-conscious about it and really
bummed out because I love wearing like
off the shoulder top like this and it's
kind of I don't know I hate back knee
back knee sucks ass I dealt with it for
so long but finally I asked you guys
again like what do you recommend I want
to try some new products out and a lot
of you recommended this it's the pan
also be decided on the bill acne phony
wash its maximum strength and has
benzoyl peroxide 10% it says it clears
existing acne blemishes and help prevent
new voters from forming
quickly penetrates pores killing acne
causing bacteria on contact this stuff
works okay this works within a week of
me using it I'm telling you it was like
painful painful breakouts that I had and
this is clear everything up so well my
back is still healing so you can see
like red spots but for the most part
there is no like whiteheads or breakouts
at all so right now I'm just in that
like healing process and this has
seriously helped me so much I don't know
if you guys remember but I mentioned
that like vibrating silicone brush that
I use right back I still use that with
this and it is just so so good I am so
happy I try this out I got mine at
Target you can get at Walgreens if yes I
believe that this used to be something
that would be prescribed but now it's
over the counter is what it looks like
take a screenshot go get it if you're
struggling with acne because this will
change your life
okay the last product is for hair this
is the igk texture spray and this is so
nice - it smells Oh smells like summer
it just smells amazing and what I love
the most about this is that it's not
heavy and it's not sticky it just gives
you some nice added texture all it does
is adds some grit to your hair and make
it a little bit PC but not too intense
it doesn't like way down the hair make
me feel greasy anything like that it's
been really enjoying this the can is
really cute and I'll just use this after
I've cooled my hair just so it has some
grit to it especially if I have clean
hair I will spray this all over just to
kind of add some texture to it and hold
the curl a little bit more let's get in
to the missus so the first miss I have
is literally just because of the smell
and I feel like this doesn't necessarily
like get the grease out of my hair I
feel like this makes my hair more greasy
which is crazy because I love every
other dry shampoo from this brand I just
hate this one it is the sweet and
delicious sweety dry shampoo from
batiste I kid I stand this metal oh my
gosh I don't even know what it reminds
me of but it just oh it's one of those
smells that made me nauseous throughout
the day and I really feel like it didn't
even make my hair look refreshed or
anything I felt like any
thing is they may look ten times worse
if you are a straight-up brunette you
need to use the Burnet batiste dry
shampoo because it doesn't give you a
white cast but right now since I'm a
little bit more blonde I do like a
little bit of white cast because it
lightens up my roots just a bit for
those wondering all of my roots is my
natural hair color so all we do is just
add highlights in but I love this like
clean and light fair one I love the
coconut exotic tropical one this one is
awful I do not like it this is another
product from igk but it's the prenup
instant spray hair masque I just I did
not see a difference with this I don't
like the spray of it either she's like a
really thin aggressive spray if anything
I would wish it was like a mousse or
something like that a little bit lighter
and when I use this I did use quite a
bit of it and I did exactly what it said
to leave it in for 2-3 minutes and then
rinse it with cool water which I never
do that but I did it cuz it said to I
feel like it made my hair more dry like
it was harder to brush out my hair I
could just use my regular conditioner
and I would have been fine and this is
supposed to be a mask so I'm not
impressed by this if you tried it let me
know how you like to use it I even tried
spraying into my hand and putting it on
my hair that didn't work either so I
just know the six sends it to now this
is the biggest myth of mist it will it
is amiss this is the biggest myth of the
first I despise the smell of this I
despise it and I always you know I saw
it back in my collection l but I haven't
used that because it's so easy I'm a
self tanning junkie I live for it this
is a st. Tropez itself can't express
broadening this and you can do it like
where it's one hour you have like two
hours and medium tan three hours of dark
pan this works tan wise I brought this
with me to Boston and I was like okay
I'll spray the night before because I
needed a little something on my chest
the rest of me was tan been even my
chest to be a little more tan in my hand
so I just sprayed it on there but let me
tell you if you do not have ventilation
when you are spraying this part you are
going to regret ever spreading it on
your body and if you hate the way some
self-tanner smell you haven't tried
yes I am not a fan it does work but I
cannot get past it I should not use this
on my body
no no so that was a way to end the
services I don't mean to be so
aggressive but that's not so bad but
anyways so now missions you guys my
favorites now this month I have been so
into 90s country and stuff like that
like older music I don't know what it is
and when I was flying home recently I
was watching Lizzie McGuire and probably
like the only 12 most 26 year old that
is sitting there watching Disney Channel
shows where I look really weird probably
around other people but there's
something about watching Lizzie McGuire
that makes it takes me back to a point
in my life where I felt like everything
was just so easy and it was fun like I
wanted to be like her I had the same
phone as her I mean it's one of those
things where I remember being a child
and watching it I don't remember a lot
of stuff but I remember like I genuinely
enjoyed that show and it's when I look
for - and it just brings back a lot of
emotions
I was literally emotionally attached to
that show so I feel that way with like
90s country and older country music when
I listen to it it just takes me back to
the kid and like all the memories with
those songs like singing it with my
parents and it was just it's just it's
just crazy to think about it now that
I've explained all of that to you guys I
know that was incredibly long I'm going
to show you some of my favorites one of
my favorite artists and I was younger it
was Alan Jackson and Chattahoochee was
the okay so if you don't like
boulder country music you probably won't
