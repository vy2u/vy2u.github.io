my June favorites and I actually have
quite a bit of new stuff to show you
guys so I'm really excited I have a
bunch of newest song favorites which is
always my favorite part of your favorite
videos so yeah if you want to see what
I've been loving then just keep watching
ok so the first like standout products
of the month for me are these NYX Avant
pop palettes I'm so in love with these I
think they're amazing the pigmentation
is perfection and they blend out so well
this one's I'm not even gonna try to
pronounce this this is the shade of the
more neutral one I knew I was gonna love
this just with the colors of it I mean
the colors are so beautiful and they can
be used in so many different ways you
have some cool tones you get some warm
shades a few nice matte shades in here I
mean you can do a whole look with this
which I did do a smokey eye with this if
you want to check it out I'll link it
down below I loved the way it turned out
like it was one of my favorite looks
like a dental month what am i go to
looks is putting in this shade in the
crease this on the lid this a little bit
in the outer corner and the mist under
under the brow bone and that's just been
kind of like my go-to look with this one
so I love love love it and then this
other one is called surreal my heart
which again I really love the colors are
beautiful these shades are just perfect
for summer and let me just show you like
how pigmented they are they're soaking
with it so definitely check these off
you see them in Ulta that's where I
found mine they were just like in a
display of front nose like um who are
you I need you so I got them so now I'm
just gonna show you guys my lip products
I've been loving I have quite a few I
went to Mac and got like so many
lipsticks I was gonna do a haul but it
was just the whole full of only
lipsticks that's all it was so I decided
not to do that but the two I have been
absolutely loving which I don't have one
of them right now
but you guys probably know what it looks
like it swirl which is the same exact
shade and the lip pencil I love it I'm
wearing constantly this one is the one I
worn
last video and this is called antique
velvet which I mean I know I know these
are like fall colors but I mean I
couldn't resist
I couldn't resist so antique velvet
definitely one of my favorite um I also
have one from Too Faced melted Chihuahua
I still have no idea where my other one
is so I did buy one I know I said I
gonna buy another one but I loved it so
much I just had to go buy it again
so this one is melted Chihuahua and
that's what it looks like so very
gorgeous everyday kind of pinky mauve
color it's just stunning and then the
last lip product that I have just been
loving is this NYX simply nude lip cream
and espresso OH
oh my god I love I love I love these I
love these so much so that's this price
are right there these are very very
creamy when you're applying them to your
lips if you give it like 10 to 15
minutes it will dry completely matte and
it will not move from your lips all
night once it's completely matte it's
not gonna move so I love this it does
take a little bit to dry but I don't
care because I just first off I love the
formula how creamy it is when you first
put it on and then I'm not paying
attention throughout the day and it just
dries matte and it doesn't go anywhere
so yeah I love these I also love sable
oh these are so good I love them okay
another product I've been loving is my
lorac Pro contour kit I think this is
just such a great palette I love
everything about it the shimmer
highlight the yellow highlight the beige
highlight contour shades I love
everything about it I've been using this
deep contour one as an eyeshadow because
it's just way too deep for my skin tone
but I love this for my eyeshadow like a
crease color or whatever I think this is
just a great great palette I love how
thin it is it does have that NARS
packaging so obviously it's like really
dirty but I love this a lot I did a full
in-depth review and tutorial if you
wanna check it out I'll link that down
below as well also for contouring I've
been doing this some days I don't
remember every single time but I put
makeup on but I've been doing this like
probably for a while now I've been
taking it this Smashbox
contour stick and this is in the shade
contour and it's a really nice contour
stick that's what it looks like so what
I'll do is I'll just draw a little line
where I'd morning place my contour and
then I take this brush from morphe
actually I'm not gonna blend this out
with all that lipstick but then I just
take this brush from morphe it's C
number in five one two and I like this
because it's small and precise and it is
dense but it's not too dense so it's
perfect we're just getting a right in
there and blending this out before I put
it on my contour powder so if I'm going
for like a really long wearing look I'll
put this down first and then put the
contour powders on top and it lasts like
ridiculously long especially if I'm
going on I know I'm gonna be sweating I
like to have a cream contour just to
kind of lock that contour in place and
make sure it doesn't move so yeah that
little contour stick from Smashbox has
been one of my favorites lately and it's
just it comes in a set of three but I've
only been using this one this is my
favorite thing I discovered this month I
have had this in my drawer for a hot
minute now something about it I did not
like the ambient lighting patterns I did
not I have not been a huge hourglass fan
to quite honest with you but when I saw
that they can own bronzers I was like
damn
anyways when I saw that they came out
with bronzers I was like hold up I need
it in my life so this is the radiant
bronze light bronzing powder and when
you look at it you're kind of like yeah
I don't know how that's gonna be a
bronzer I mean you see like swirls of a
lighter shade in there and in the darker
shade to me I was like this is probably
gonna be super shimmery and look really
crazy boy was I wrong this is one of the
most and sanely beautiful bronzers I
have ever used in my life I am not
kidding I am so obsessed with this
product and makes me look like I went to
the Bahamas for like 3000 weeks and I
came back and I was just like a bronze
goddess this has been
my new favorite go-to bronzer it lasts
all day it is so smooth it blends like a
freakin dream I love this like it makes
me want to go back and try some ambient
lighting powders and see if I like them
again because this is beautiful it does
have shimmer in it but you cannot tell
on your face at all you see no shimmer
on your face it just gives you this
bronzed warm glow if there's anything in
this whole entire video you need it's
this get it okay next pick up product is
actually by NARS this is something I've
had for a while now - this is the NARS
dual intensity blush in jubilation I
would never use these as blushes I would
only use them as highlighters you can
see this side is more peach and this
side is more gold what I like to do is
just mix the two together if you're
wondering that's what they look like
just side by side but once you mix them
together you get the most beautiful
highlight ever and it's an amazing
amazing dupe before Estee Lauder's heat
wave I have it on the tops of my
cheekbones now it's a very shimmery very
beautiful and long-lasting but heat wave
is no longer in stock from what I know I
don't know if they're bringing it back
there's so much controversy with it some
people say they are some people say they
aren't I don't know they should bring it
back because it's amazing this is heat
wave if you're wondering and if you mix
the two things together though you will
get heat wave like it looks so similar
and beautiful so check this out I love
it I think it's great I love NARS I'm
such an arse fan so this was perfect
next product is actually from ELF and I
dabble back into this this month and I
was just like yes so pretty so this is
the elf blush palette in light and I
mainly use this for one shade in here
because I love it so much
first I have to say though the packaging
is pretty legit like that's a huge huge
mirror and these powdered blushes are
phenomenal they are very pigmented very
creamy easy to blend as well I mean they
are stunning but the color that I have
been obsessed with is this one right
here and you can pop these out and like
make your own
customizable palette if you want to like
switch out you know different ones I
also have the dark palette but I just
been reaching for this one so this is
that shade right there I think it is
just so beautiful this is a perfect
everyday color it's a very very warm and
I just love it like it that's my kind of
color right there so yeah check out
these elf blush palettes I think they
are so amazing I think they should come
out one more colors of these because
they did a really really great job on
these blushes so hopefully we'll see
some more soon so the last blush I want
to talk to you about is this urban decay
blush and video I was debating on
getting these because I didn't know if I
would like them or not I heard such
mixed reviews and a my sapporo i asked
if you guys like them what should i do
and a lot of you said yes try them out
so I decided just to get one and see how
I likes it the formula first off the
packaging is just adorable the detail
that they do what their packaging is
just amazing but this is what the color
looks like it's obviously very basic
something I would use every single day I
didn't want to buy like a hot pink blush
knowing I wasn't gonna use it everyday
but I really do like it it's a very it's
right there it's a very smooth powder I
do like it though you see it's really
pretty it's just a really gorgeous
everything color again blends very
smoothly and it just looks beautiful on
the skin
I wouldn't say does this date last eight
hours last hours I don't know about
lasting eight hours but for me I love
the color and I love the texture and
just how well it looks on the skin and
how it blends this is a matte shade and
I really like it um I don't think I
would purchase any other ones because
there was no other blushes that were
kind of like wow in my face I wanted to
have them this was the one I wanted and
I really really do like it so if you've
been looking at video I would definitely
check it out okay and really quickly I
showed you guys in my Sephora haul that
every purchased the Smashbox pore
minimizing primer and I was like oh well
maybe you'll be good with the photo
finish primer water yes yes yes these
two duo yes they are everything they are
made for each other I love this combo I
will just spray my face with the primer
water and then put this on top and it's
like a smooth beautiful canvas and I'm
just so in love with it I mean these two
are just like my dynamic duo I love them
so I had no hopes for this guy I thought
this was gonna be complete crap and it
turned out to be amazing and when I was
4 I actually got the travel size to keep
in my purse I'm really in love with this
no other spray has ever made me see a
difference but this makes me see such
huge difference in my skin especially if
I don't use it and then I'm really
quickly gonna tell you guys some little
brushes I've been loving I am back to
loving this makeup geek face buffer
brush for foundation this is amazing
especially with Estee Lauder Double Wear
is so beautiful I don't know what
Marlena did with this brush but she hit
the nail on the head with this one
because it's the perfect foundation
brush like you need this in your life
and especially if you have Estee Lauder
Double Wear which I know a lot do you do
you wouldn't love it with this it just
it blends so well into the skin so check
this out so good I'm on the links for
things down below if you wanna check it
out I've also been loving this one from
morphe I don't know if I mentioned this
last month I don't think I did maybe I
did I don't know if I did I'm sorry this
is a more feet and before 6 - I love
this it's more of a rounded stippling
brush I like this for multiple reasons I
like it for bronzer if I want to do like
a light you know light dusting of it I
like to blend out products I'll apply
blush with it it's just a great
multi-purpose brush and I heart it it's
very good
so buxom now has customizable palettes
and this is the one that I picked and
put the colors together for and can you
just obviously like these are my shades
like yeah if I had to create a palette
this is along the lines of what it would
look like I have one two three four five
matte shades and one super shade you can
see they're nice and warm and just so
pretty and I've been using this non-stop
I think it's really cool they came out
with a way that you can pick a palette
customize it with six shades which I
feel like is a lot and then
just throw it in there and me get two I
think that's really cool so yeah these
buxom palates definitely check them out
highly highly recommend them the
eyeshadows are amazing actually use
these in my video it's on Saturday which
was like a get ready with me for going
out cuz I went up Saturday night and I
used this palette so that video will
upbeat up within the next few days I
think but yes I love I love it okay I
also want to mention my extensions as
most of you could probably tell I got my
hair cut off a lot I got like two inches
cut off as much people I probably like
that is not a lot of hair but to me it
was I wanted to get all the dead ends
and like fried ends off and now my hair
is like so freakin healthy it's
ridiculous
but I did cut some my extensions to this
length because I didn't feel like you
know messing with you know trying to
blend them really well so I'm actually
wearing my foxy locks extensions
and they're the I forget what grams and
stuff they are I've had them for so long
that I just forget but I leave what kind
of use in the description box below but
I just love them they give my hair so
much volume and I just I love them and
you can't even tell I have them they're
just they're so awesome I only use like
two or three wives that's it because
there's so much hair on them that
there's no need for me to use a whole
entire packet on my head because I would
be like what am and if you want to see
me like putting them in my hair I'll
leave a video down below where I did
that it was like a to how I style second
third day hair so if you wanna check it
out I will leave that down below for you
