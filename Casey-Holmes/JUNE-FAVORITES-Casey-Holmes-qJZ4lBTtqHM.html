to be sharing with you my June favorites
yes June I cannot believe June is almost
over I know everybody says that about
every month but like actually June has
been the craziest month of my life I
think this is the most I've traveled in
a very long time and like a span of the
month I travel for two weeks straight
came back for like four days went to New
York I'm back for a few days and I leave
for LA in like two days
so it's been such a crazy month but I'm
so blessed I've had such an amazing time
so like I said I'm gonna share with you
guys my favorites for the month I am
doing a first impression right now so if
you haven't seen it I'll link it down
below because it should be up before
this one it's on the covergirl clean
matte BB cream so definitely check that
out and down below first thing I'm going
to mention to you guys is makeup brushes
and this one right here has been amazing
amazing amazing I love it so much this
is a great dupe for the NARS brush
that's like this I forget what it's
called it's like a different kind of
name but it looks exactly like this and
I actually got this from Ulta for $20
which is a deal compared to the other
one that Norris has then honestly I felt
that NARS won this one feels exactly
like it and it blends product so well
and what I love about this brush is that
it's a multi-purpose brush you can use
it to set your face you can use it for
bronzer you can just for blush anything
you want to use it for this brush is
perfect for that because it's not too
big it's not too small it's very fluffy
and it just blends so well I highly
recommend checking out this brush from
japonesque I believe they have a few
more brushes that I want to go back and
check out because this is so good that
I'm like anymore and then this is my
favorite highlighting brush right now
it's the Anastacio eight to three a two
three not eight to three I don't know if
I mentioned this to you guys a couple
months ago but if I didn't I'm itching
it now and if I did I'm mentioning it
now because it is so awesome I love this
highlighting brush it's like that
perfect shape where it just fits right
on the top of your cheekbone and just
blends highlight so well I'm obsessed
with this highlighting brush I
definitely think it's worth the money
this is just so easy to apply it and
buff in
to the cheek definitely check out this
brush if you're looking for a new one
it's so freakin good so freaking good so
now I'm going to mention to you a couple
hair products I have a ton of questions
from you guys all the time asking me
what my hair care routine is and I just
have it really done a hair care routine
because I use a lot of the same products
I just switch up different things
depending on what my hair looks like so
I went lighted with my hair as you guys
know and one of my favorite shampoos
this is been my favorite shampoo for a
while I think it was like the first time
I went
blonder last year I use a shampoo and
I'm just obsessed with it this is the
bubble and bubble BB hairdressers
invisible oil to sulfate free shampoo
and it has six but I like oils to help
soften silken tamed ypres detangle and
protect this is such a great product if
you have really dry ends if your
coloring your hair a lot if your hair is
very tangling my hair gets so insanely
tangley insanely timely my hair gets so
tangling and this is just amazing it
honestly feels so good when I wash my
hair with this it doesn't make my hair
feel dry when I'm shampooing it and then
when I blow-dry my hair I just blew dry
my hair today and it's been kind of
frizzy and just because I've been going
lighter with it but it looks good to me
I think this looks pretty good
so I love this definitely check it out
if you have dry damaged hair color
treated hair anything like that you just
want a really nice shampoo that's like
worth the money this is just such a good
product I enjoy it so much it has a
great scent so going on to just a couple
more things for my hair I'm going to
quickly shop them out you guys know I've
been using this for years honestly I
don't even know when the first time I
started using this was it's the kinder
platinum blow dry spray this is just
amazing at giving you a nice shine to
your hair and it does help your hair dry
faster when you're blow-drying it I
can't stay away from this product like I
just love the way it makes my hair look
whenever I don't use it I can tell that
my hair is not as shiny I highly
recommend this if you want to cut down
drying time and add some shine to your
hair this is definitely the product for
you and then another one that I've been
incorporating into my routine is this
kenra platinum revive complex leave-in
fortifier basically it says that it
hydrates perfects and protects the
formula combat dehydration 495 95% less
breakage after the first use provides
thermal protection
up to 450 degrees and improves the
appearance of dry brittle ends totally
agree
it really just smooths down my hair they
also have a frisk control that is
amazing I just can't find it right now
because it's all packed up but that's
amazing - I've just been using this when
I'm home and I love it it makes my skin
feel so smooth
they don't look frizzy it just it's just
perfect one more thing before we go on
to makeup are actually two more things
one thing is a body product I actually
got this in Alice in Charleston
Charleston the Victoria's Secret
seduction of fragrance mist I'm obsessed
with the way that the smelled is amazing
the only thing I don't like is that it
does not last a long time at all like I
don't smell this for a long period of
time I need to see if they have a
perfume of this if you guys know if they
do let me know down below but this
smells so freaking good
like seduction I totally get it it's it
oh it's so good it just smells amazing
and honestly I could drench myself in
this for my skin I've been using a new
exfoliator I've been looking for one
because I feel like the cake Somerville
one was breaking me out I don't know
what happened it was good for such a
long time and then my face just started
randomly breaking out but since I
switched over like my exfoliator I have
been doing really well my skin hasn't
broke out at all so this is the Dior
instant gentle exfoliant with pure lily
extract and it's for all skin types and
this is Dior so it is very pricey but
honestly I feel like skincare is
something you should save up for because
you have your skin for the rest of your
life and you want to take care of it
when I look for exfoliators I look for
something that is going to completely
exfoliate my skin but not be very harsh
because I do have sensitive skin as well
so this is that perfect combination it's
a creamy formula but it does have like
gentle beads in there that just
exfoliate the skin and it doesn't your
take me at all and when I had done my
Sephora haul
I had like peeling all over the tops of
my forehead I was just a hot mess from
like here back to my scalp but I used
this and it took off all of that dead
skin and it made it so smooth and it
even made it feel hydrated that's what I
love about this product it just made my
skin feel so good and I felt like I had
my skin back because it was so dry and
nothing no none
make up I put on look good on my
forehead but this helped within a couple
of days to just exfoliate that area and
to get all of that dead skin off so I
really like it I don't use it every
single day I just use it every other day
every three days it just depends on
what's going on with my skin but I
really love it it has a fresh scent and
I definitely think that it is worth the
money alright moving oh hello
moving on to makeup I want to mention a
couple different things first thing I'm
just going to quickly mention the
anasazi a bloke it and that glow I have
been wearing this out this month I mix a
lot of these shades together mainly
these three I love them so much I've
used them on my eyes my brows my face
I've used them on my body absolutely
everywhere I love them they're very very
pigmented and they're perfect for summer
because they just have that golden glow
on the stasi a glow kitten that glow is
definitely a must-have product and then
another thing I mentioned this last
month it's the desert dunes baked
bronzer in warm melange this is from
Kiko cosmetics eye I still really love
this it's amazing but I also wanted to
include this highlighter I took this
with me on my cruise and I loved it
this is the Kiko desert moon highlighter
in Desert Rose I have been so skeptical
of highlighters like this because I'm
usually not one that likes the beaded
highlighters I'm like this so gimmicky
like why would you even want to use that
I don't get it but I got this and I was
like what the hell I'm gonna try it and
honestly you guys it is such a beautiful
highlighter it just gives you the most
gorgeous glow of your life you
definitely want to use a brush with it
so I like to use the honest Asya one but
once you take this and like add it onto
your face it just gives the most
gorgeous glow to your skin I already
have like so much highlighter on but
honestly it's it's so beautiful trust me
when I say this is amazing if you just
want that everyday glow nothing too
intense just something very pretty and
kind of looks natural kind of not
because you could tell you have a
highlighter on it's so beautiful the
beads are gorgeous formula it just
slides over your skin it doesn't like
accentuate pores or texture anything
like that it's so nice it
a pretty large package but this is so
good
moving on to brows I have been using the
benefit Cabral this is the pomade I'm in
number four the shades are very
forgiving I thought I was going to be a
lighter shade since I did go lighter
with my hair but four does work out for
me it matches my roots fairly well so
definitely check this out I've been
using it over my Anastacio pomade this
is just what it looks like on the inside
and it does have a little brush here on
the end what I mainly use this for is if
I mess up and I need to go on with
concealer that's what I'll use this
brush for but it's not my favorite to
actually fill in my brows so just
figured I would mention that to you guys
this formula is really good and it stays
on for such a long time so benefit cut
brow is one to try I know everybody's
been talking about them but if you have
to have one thing from the line and you
love brow pomade this is definitely the
product that I would suggest the only
kind of out of order none of this is in
order at all as you can tell but I have
been loving this primer this is the Cain
and Austin prime and protect mattifying
primer it has SPF 50 in it and this is
such a great smoothing mattifying primer
for those with oily skin and even think
if you have normal skin you could use
this it's not a mattifying primer where
it's going to like suck the life out of
your skin and really dry everything out
it just smooths over your pores filled
them in and gives you just this nice
matte base to put your foundation on top
and it is it's just the best
I am so obsessed with this I'm so happy
that I decided to try this out because
I've never tried anything from this
brand before but this with my Smashbox
primer water I just love this I mean I'm
gonna use it with like every primer for
the rest of my life but that with this
is just so good this does kind of even
out the skin tone as well so that's a
bit that's even a better plus I just
have a tip to it as you can see right
there it's more of a thicker primer but
you guys is so good is that silicone
base that it gives it's just oh my god
it's amazing please try this out I
highly recommend it I got it Oh -
Sephora I don't believe they have this
in the store so been using the Too Faced
Born This Way concealer mine's like
super dirty right now but this one's in
lye
medium I'm also using the shade medium
right now just because I'm a little bit
more tan but this is a great concealer I
mentioned again in my last video that
this does have really great coverage if
you think that the Born This Way
Foundation doesn't have that much
coverage definitely give this a try
because I was thinking that this is
going to be a little bit more sheer
because that foundation is like a medium
to full coverage and I think my Urban
Decay Naked skin concealer is definitely
more full coverage it brightens up that
area it does have a scent to it it's not
terrible just know it does have a scent
but once you blend everything in and you
set your concealer you'll be fine you
won't even notice that it has a scent
the Too Faced natural radiant Born This
Way concealer is awesome I do quickly
want to mention my translucent setting
powder that I've been using it's the
shadow or shishito I'm sorry I need to
read the comments again and remember how
to say this if they're translucent
setting powder and I love it is such a
finely milled powder and it's really
just melt into the skin makes everything
look beautiful and when you dust it away
it just leaves a nice smooth flawless
finish currently obsessed with this I
wanted to kind of switch up with my
Laura Mercier powder and try something
new so I have been really loving that
and I just would quickly want to shout
out this meat matrimony matte eyeshadow
palette from the balm I took this on
most of my trips and I really liked it
it's just the all matte eyeshadow
palette which is super useful I mean you
could do so many different looks with
this palette I love the shades that they
have in here you know you have a lot of
good transition shades you have a lot of
good dark matte shades in some other
shades to kind of put all over the lid
and to highlight with so this has been
one of my favorites it's a good palette
to use either by itself or with other
palettes that are more shimmery it's
good and the mirror is pretty awesome as
well okay then the last things I want to
mention makeup wise are these newest
Smashbox liquid lipsticks guys I have
decided that these are my ABS no not
today I have decided that these are
definitely my favorite matte liquid
lipsticks I have put these to the test
these are all I've been using all month
I even switched it up and started using
the Too Faced what is it the melted
liquid lipsticks and I do like those but
I like these better I like the way they
wear better I like the way they feel
better it's just such a great formula
there's so many different colors that I
like to like I can't
just pick one so I'll list them all down
below the two that I have right here
that I absolutely am obsessed with are
driver's seat
look at how pigmented that is and I love
this applicator right here - it's so
awesome it holds just enough product to
put it all over your lips you don't have
to keep going back into the product to
get more so I love that and this one is
also babe alert this one actually went
through my washer and dryer so shout out
to it for lasting through that this is
more of a pinky tone I love it so so
beautiful what else on my cruise there
was a couple nights where I forgot to
take off my makeup just because you get
a little too rowdy and you forget to
take off your makeup so I would put
those on and literally the next morning
it looked like I just applied lipstick
it was the craziest thing I was like
okay these are awesome
it says they're eight hour wear but I
think you can wear them for even longer
than that that they're just so good I'm
not just saying that because I'm
collabing with this brand I'm saying
that because it's literally the best
liquid lipstick that I have tried I
would not steer you wrong I highly
suggest you guys go trying a couple
shades out I'll leave my favorite shades
down below because I have so many so if
you guys are wondering what's on my eyes
right now it is the lorac pro number 3
palette I absolutely love this I am only
used it once so I'm not going to tell
you to go buy it right now now but it is
what I use I love it I think I'm going
to do a tutorial on this look but I just
want to shout this out just in case you
were wondering now I'm going to mention
to you guys
music favorites I have quite a few
favorites just because I didn't mention
any last month always if you guys don't
follow my Spotify I will leave it in
this video right here just so you can go
check it out and see what I'm loving
throughout the month I've been loving
really really from Kevin gates just
because it really just pumps me up and I
like to dance and I've been doing lots
of road trips and listening to music on

good mood and this song does that for me

album what was it last month I've been
listening to all of it and I love all of
it this song is my favorite

wouldn't be surprised if Davis knew the
words that another one I've been loving

like as a fan but I'm really enjoying
this song
every time I start doing the music
