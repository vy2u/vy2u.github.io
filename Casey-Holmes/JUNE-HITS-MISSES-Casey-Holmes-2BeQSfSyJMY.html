June favorites actually play tune hits
and misses I do have quite a few misses
and a lot a lot a lot of his so I missed
last month because I was moving of
course you guys know I moved from
Georgia to New York and it was a process
I didn't even wear makeup really two
weeks and then I got here got the whole
setup goin and I have been just playing
with makeup ever since so very excited
to share with you guys my favorites I
have skin care I have some brushed up I
have brushes got a lot to share with you
and I see so I'm going to share with you
guys everything is that I have for you
again like I said you do have quite a
few minted and I also have some song
favorites and don't mind the ponytail I
had to blow-dry it today you know when
you watch them blow dry your hair it's
kind of like that's it I'm done styling
it don't forget to subscribe for you
leave saying I miss out on any of my
videos and yeah let's just go ahead and
get started so the first thing I want to
talk about is what I've been
highlighting my buzz a with and it is
these two products but this listing two
oxygen own aglow this is the body glow
in medium and I think I've mentioned
this before on my channel I really do
like it's the only thing I don't like is
the packaging right here sometimes
products will get cut up back in the
nozzle like where you can't reach it and
when you go to square out it like worked
everywhere no matter how much you point
it down to just somehow comes out like
this so that's the only thing I don't
like about it I do like the color this
is actually what I have on my chest you
see right here it shines really bright
and then the shoulders are like BAM so
shoulder one is the Marc Jacobs do you
drop these are definitely more intense
that I like these for my shoulders so I
do like it this one for my chest because
I don't like a lot of shine on my child
I just like a little bit to make it look
nice and glowy which Natasha's another
one is great for but if I want something
that's super intense I will go with the
Marc Jacobs lines next up I just want to
shout out is the body shop japanese
camilla camilla cream I probably said
that wrong as you're going to roast me
but if I spelled it moisture body cream
now I really like this this is something
that I got from the PX
I've used quite a bit of it like I'm
almost out I love the smell of it it
just smells so refreshing and like
pretty and I'm gonna know how to
describe it it just smells really really
good and it is a really nice moisturizer
it doesn't leave like that sticky foam
on you but you do feel nice and hydrated
so that's why I really like this is my
daytime moisturizer I really quickly
want to talk about my skincare products
that I have been loving this is my
skincare routine right now I'm going
back and forth with what makeup remover
that I like I'm still really like
obsessed with the Clinique take out the
day cleansing balm but I'm out of it so
I need to go purchase another one but
I've been using the cope re coconuts
remover it's just like a I don't know
cleanse off oil but it's like coconut or
something it's nice for some my favorite
these products have not changed for the
past few months and I love them I just
repurchased these two products cuz I'm
completely out of this guy this was
actually said to me in PR I'm going to
be honest when I first tried it I did
not think I was going to love it I stuck
to it and then has really worked so well
for my skin so first things I want to
talk about that I actually repurchase as
well is the drunk elephant C firm add a
serum and also the TLC Fram booth
glycolic night serum and then the tight
these are amazing together I used to
never be your serum kind of person but I
really feel like these have changed my
skin this one is supposed to firm in
brian which i hunterson agree with and
then this one is supposed to refine and
retexture if you have texture you need
this in your life I am not kidding a lot
of you have noticed the big difference
in my skin and that's because I am
strict on my skincare regimen and I have
to use these products as well as these
but I feel like no matter what else you
take from this video these are a
must-have if you're struggling with your
skin going to really want these because
they change the way your skin feels the
texture your pores everything just
glides on a lot smoother I highly
recommend these products I stand by them
a hundred and ten percent or so
travel-friendly they never accidentally
open up and spill everywhere because you
just twist it down twist it up when
you're ready to use and then for my
cleanser I've been using this
Dermalogica
special cleansing gel I really love this
because it doesn't strip
my skin it doesn't make it feel dry it
actually makes it feel a little more
hydrated and I really like that it's
like a moisturizing cleanser and I don't
use it as like a makeup remover I do my
makeup remover first and then cleanse my
skin with this and I just really like it
I think it's a great cleanser and I have
just been really enjoying it and
enjoying it so much that I purchased
another one so they did get this is PR
and normally when I get PR stuff I'll
just kind of switch over and like try
different skincare item that I have that
was sent to me as well but I had to
repurchase this because I just feel like
I can't be without it and I feel like
it's really helped with balancing out my
skin so I love this and therefore
moisturizer I love this active moist
moisturizer from Dermalogica is this
great because it really gets in there
and moisturize your skin but it's not
super greasy or anything like that you
can wear this under makeup I've even
used this in the night time it's oil
free lightweight 100% agree with that
and it is great for combo skin which I
completely agree with so I love it this
is a smaller tube when I purchased this
the other day I did get you bigger tube
just so I wouldn't run out of it those
are my skincare items my must-haves for
every single day like if I go without
them I noticed the biggest difference in
my skin and I actually with my skincare
while we were moving and I was so upset
because my skin was a hot mess it was
trying to use new products that I had
and it just wasn't cutting it and my
texture was really bad and I was
breaking out but when I got back on
these four products I noticed the
biggest difference and I just my skin so
smooth and its really calmed down the
redness is kind of toned down I mean I
still have the rosacea but it's really
common another thing I think it's great
to add to your routine is this one this
is the philosophy take a deep breath
night I love to take a deep breath
moisturizer I believe that's the
oil-free moisturizer from not mistaken
because I used to use it all the time
and actually still have it as like a
backup item in my drawer but this is
different this is a oil free to talk to
find gel balm so love the fact that it's
oil free and it is literally a gel you
can't really see it too much but it's
just a jelly so like you'll dip your
finger in here and get some product off
you need the littlest amount because it
does go a long way when you let it sit
in the jar it just smoothes out because
it's not a jelly consistency and we'll
do this every
but I do maybe once or twice a week I'll
use this product and put it all over my
face instead of like my moisturizer and
it really does hydrate the skin and make
you glow like your skin looks so
beautiful the next day it is just insane
it's kinda like an overnight mask and I
love it I feel like this does hydrate
really nicely and helps smooth out the
skin and keep everything up to date and
it's kind of like a nice little
treatment at night and this smells so
good highly recommend this again is a
philosophy take a deep breath and night
all right the next thing I want to
mention is for your brushes I have been
using this for quite a few months now
but I don't think I've ever talked to
you guys about it but I just love this
because this is a best brush cleanser I
think I've ever used and it's like like
a spot cleanser so it's the brush bath
purifying brush cleaner from it
cosmetics you can get this at Ulta and
this is great because it doesn't dry out
the bristles of your brushes sometimes
the kind of leaves the oily feel if
you're not careful if you use too much
then I will have like that oily film on
there so the lowest amount goes a long
way and it really does take out all of
the color in your brushes I've been
cleaning my brushes with this and I love
it because perfect to use right before I
film because it dries very quickly and
all of the color is completely taken out
of the brush hairs so I love this I
think this is great I like it better
than like the mask
brush cleaner and that sa water one
which is pretty much the same thing
because this one does not dry out the
bristles it conditions them and cleans
them at the same time really quickly I
just want to shout out this guy this
thing makes me so bronzed and I'm just
oh I love it so much and I quickly want
to say I used to really love the dark
one but now I'm an ultra dark kind of
girl like I feel like I've told you guys
so long this time I'm an ultra dark girl
but I tried dark the other week and I
did not like it I felt like I got no
color and I did all that self-tanning
for no reason but then I went back to
ultra dark and I get really nice and
still tan so I guess I'm really used to
the ultra dark I recommend this one if
you want something deep and bronzed and
lasts a long time and by far my favorite
and no reason so praising why I'm
mentioning this to you is because I
tried out a new self-tanning product
this month that I saw all over
I don't want to round it out it's also
bad they were on HSN when I was there it
was tan Lux and I tried it out and I was
so with streaky
so streaky girl I've been self-tanning
for a very long time and it's I mean it
has really good ingredients and
everything great benefits for your skin
but it doesn't have like a color guard
or anything like that and I try I try
hard I really tried to make it work and
I just became streaky every single time
my hands were so orange I looked awful
so bad to the point where I was at the
nail salon with ratchet up hands it
shows like who's I hate it knows like so
I went back to this and I was like I
will never ever leave you again this is
my favorite I do have a code for you
guys if you want to get a free knit with
it but I highly recommend it it's the
best of the best hands down now we're
going to go ahead and move on to makeup
first foundation I want to talk about is
e Natasha Jenner on a foundation as the
full coverage foundation foundation
foundation this is wearing now I
absolutely love it I love the color of
this this is in the shade 42 medium this
is great for when my self tan is not
fresh it's more you know dying down
getting to this shade where it's fading
away a little bit this is perfect for
that and I love the packaging it's just
the frosted glass bottle you can
probably see right here I just used so
much of this I love it with a brush I
level to the Sun this last so long on my
skin it just looks really beautiful
doesn't emphasize texture pours it lasts
so well through the heat I just I love
this foundation but again this is a
Natasha de Nona foundation X full
coverage product open up a foundation
again but I felt like open so much
foundations was the one that I worked my
Miami Meetup and a lot of you love this
and we're asking me what I was wearing
on my face and SP when lost photo focus
it's literally the best drugstore
foundation for if you're taking pictures
anything like that it's just one of my
go-to for meetups I wasn't me just and I
know you guys have heard me talk about
this so many times but I just want to
quickly mention it again to let you know
I'm still eminent and I also really love
this is the maybelline superstay better
skin and the
last such a long time on my skin as well
I feel like this definitely last a lot
longer than this cover roll one that
I've also been loving but I really love
the color of this the sand beige perfect
for when I'm a little bit darker than
this and it just is such a nice full
coverage finish it has natural matte
finish it's nothing too matte it's
nothing to do it's that perfect in
between and I love how it blends out I
like to use it with a brush now I'm a
brushed for a hole right now I don't
know what happened to me but I've been
loving brushes instead of beauty
blenders and yeah I just really love
this I love it so much such a good
product I can go quite a few hours
without belonging listed products
because it sits so well on the skin and
it doesn't have like any of my oils come
through like crazy now from an oily skin
girls who want to look a little bit more
glowy but you're little scared to I
think this is the perfect foundation
this is a full coverage foundation from
cover 50 vitalist healthy elixir
foundation I have multiple shades and I
just love this I think if you want to go
more of the dewy route but you're just a
little nervous too if you get oily in
the t-zone I think this is great because
it's not too dewy for me this lasts a
lot longer than other dewy foundation
I'm normally not a dewy foundation kind
of girl that's why I was nervous to try
this at first but I ended up really
loving it and this doesn't last as long
as like the Maybelline or the Wet n Wild
but it does last quite a long time I
would necessarily wear this out in the
heat I don't think it would last very
well in the heat I would probably go
with the better skin but it is so
beautiful and it looks great and video
and all of that I just I love this
foundation next up I want to talk about
this highlighter from Maybelline this is
the master chrome by face studio
metallic highlighter is exactly what it
says is the metallic highlighter this is
in the shade molten gold I don't think
they have any other shades out right now
maybe they will but this is really nice
the only thing I will say is a little
bit of a chunkier formula it looks
really beautiful on the skin and it's
really like a high shine metallic glow
but it is a little chunky as it looks
like I mean it is so gorgeous but
sometimes on the skin it can just have
little chunks that you have to go back
in and really blend out but I do love
this a lot I think it looks absolutely
stunning and it's probably one as well
mom has really great highlighters so I
can't say the best but up there was like
a top 5 favorite highlighters from the
drugstore speaking of being bronze I
have been loving this bronzer and I did
not think I was gonna love this I say
that all the time but honestly sometimes
I feel many products thinking like okay
you're so overhyped I'm not going like
you that was this product too but I love
it this is a Marc Jacobs Omega bronze
tantastic bronzer it's the perfect tan
this is women edition and I'm really sad
about it because this is the best
browser that they have it's absolutely
stunning it's what I have to bronze my
skin now that perfect tan color is blend
so well it's so smooth on the skin it's
not too warm so super orange it's not -
actually it's literally that perfect tan
color this is perfect and it's exactly
right I just love it you get a lot of
product get a nice big mirror now this
isn't like necessarily the best thing to
travel with I mean I have because I
don't care I pack whatever I want to
travel with I mean honestly I don't ever
I haven't had an issue with anything
breaking and I stuffed my stuff in my
makeup bag but I travel with this and I
love it wasn't them does it say it is
lipstick it is slim so you could just
like get it in the corner or something
yeah I really like this a lot
one of my favorite bronzers as well as
this drugstore one this is the lobby
London tan time bronzer I did a full
video testing out a bunch of Lottie
London products and this is one of them
so if you want to check that out I will
link it down below but this bronzer is
more of a warm toned browser so if you
don't like those I wouldn't recommend
this it kind of reminds me of Matt give
me Sun not you know not as on feel like
this is a little bit more pigmented than
the Mac give me Sun and I just really
like it I like the tone it has a little
bit of a terracotta feel to it very
beautiful great pigmentation great price
point you can't really beat it so if
you're looking for more of a warm toned
drugstore rahzar
this is the way to go I want to mention
this blush because I have had this in my
drawers for forever I feel like and I
hadn't used it until this month and I
have been loving it this is a benefit
gala for Nia blush and I just love this
coral sheen it's nothing too intense to
accentuate pores or anything it just
looks like a healthy glow on the skin
like this is the perfect summer blush
has a really nice smell to it and I
don't know I think this is like the
cutest thing I haven't really been the
biggest fan of benefit blushes for what
I can remember like I don't remember
really obsessing over a benefit blush
before but this one is definitely my
newfound love and this is great because
it's a nice buildable formula so you're
not going to like whoa crazy aunt is
blush actually have it all now it's just
a little wash that I have on so I like
that you can build it up and it's just
stunning okay next up is this Coke a
cosmetic the setting powder this is in
trail isn't really love this powder it's
very finely milled it's a really nice
soft focus powder the only thing I do
not like is that you barely get any
product honestly any product like I know
it's drugstore I know it's affordable I
need a little bit more product than this
okay but it does create such a soft
focus finish to the face and like I love
it so much like I think it's one of the
best powders from the drugstore and it
doesn't have a flashback or anything I
just I think it's awesome right got a
shout out these eyeliners you already
know if you watched my lobby London
video these are amazing we have the a.m.
to p.m. liner boom look at how black
that is thank you so much this stays on
your waterline like no other this does
not run on my eyes at all so I have
switched to this one I love it it is a
pencil sharpened liner kind of took me
forever to figure that out but it does
sharpen like a pencil and then we have
this felt tip liner which is just so
good this is probably going to replace
all on high-end liquid liners because it
does the exact same thing this is what
it looks like it's a salt tip I mean
honestly and it dries down to a matte
finish you don't have to continuously
shake it or anything so you just go
ahead and apply it onto your eyes those
over glitter shadows it goes over any
eyeshadow that I put on perfectly it
just smooths right over drive down match
easy to work with on crease the best and
I've used it a lot of times and the fill
tip hasn't like worn down you know how
sometimes felt-tip can kind of get a
little wonky after a few uses that is
not the case of this one
and then let's talk about a couple tools
I have been loving the cake and baked
sponge so much that I left it in the
hotel Oh a few weekends ago but it has
to have it again so I repurchased it got
it on rush I think is amazing the blend
out your concealer and to bake it's just
awesome I love it because I can get
right up there to my wing and clean it
up which is what I did today and it
looks really nice and sharp I just enjoy
that it doesn't mess up your liner or
your eyeshadow and then my brushes
you've probably seen this brush three
thousand and five hundred times 2005
everyone this is the it cosmetics
heavenly loves flat top buffing brush I
know that these expensive but Wow Wow
this is amazing it really does blend out
your foundation so well I love the thick
handle it's easy to travel with I like
that the bristles are dense but they're
not too dense they have a lot of room to
kind of wiggle around it's just one of
the best brushes I'm pretty sure this is
the brush that got me on to using more
foundation brushes and in the last but
not least thing that you probably
thought I was going to forget about the
Natasha de Nonna sunset palette you
already know this is my this is
just is just so good I love this I love
these colors you guys I know that you're
like getting onto me if we're using so
many warm tones but I just can't help it
it's summer it's warm for bronze but I
just I love this palette I think it's
great of course you know I love the
formula I think the colors in here are
just beautiful they all work so well
together you can do so many different
looks with this palette I give this one
two thumbs up and if it gets worth it
all right this talks about the misses
the first miss is this Maybelline fit me
blush in the shade nude I don't like the
formula of this I haven't tried any
other colors other than this one but
this is not show up on my skin really
well it's really dry and pretty sheer so
to me it's just not it's just not one of
my favorites I don't know like it looks
okay swatch there but using it with a
brush it just doesn't look as beautiful
on the skin so this is unfortunately a
Miss for me didn't even show up on my
skin tone which is partially my fault
because I picked a bad color but I'm not
obsessed with the formula either had two
concealers the first one I hate to say
it I hate to say it but this could treat
little camouflage high coverage
concealer with a complete
so for me I had these smokiest of smoky
eyes on now link that video down below
and I use this concealer underneath and
when I do when I have a really intense
smoky eye I need a full coverage
concealer to last this was really full
covers when it first went on it is a
little bit more I know it it makes you
look a little bit more dewy throughout
the day if you do what I do and take it
like a triangle underneath your eyes and
I don't like that it makes me a little
too oily throughout the day but this oh
my gosh you guys I have really bad
darkness like right in here this were
also that I apply I reapplied this twice
that day how'd you wear that makeup look
all day long I reapplied this twice and
it just wasn't cutting it it would not
stay here and cover up my darkness so I
ended up going in with a heart-shaped
tape and it lasted all day long all day
long says this waterproof I don't know
how this isn't even stay on without
water but yeah I'm not obsessed with
this and it does have a really intense
smell and it did sting my eyes a little
bit when I used it so I'm just going to
pass on this it wasn't my favorite and
then I did not like this Revlon use fix
fill and blur concealer I just think
this is way too damn expensive this
should be like three dollars if that is
notice any difference with a filling in
my lines or anything if anything it sunk
into my lines you made it was 10 times
worse it just wasn't my favorite and by
the way this light color is so yellow it
just it doesn't work I'm just not
impressed by this especially with the
price tag don't think it's worth it so
guys we are at the end of the product
favorite school or that long that was so
long but I missed a month so you know I
had to hook you guys back up with a
favorites video but now I'm going to
share with you some of my favorite songs
so are you ready because we got some
good ones we got some good ones and if
you are still here leave me your
favorite emoji down below in the
comments I want to know are you still
here
are you still kicking it with me getting
ready for the song favorites okay let's
start off with some country first let's
just ease into this with some country I
don't know about you guys I had been
obsessed with Shania Twain all over
again there's just something about her
that right now I'm it's bringing back
childhood memories of how much I love to
this woman I
remember all the music videos that would
come on TV and I just I can't get enough
of her I started listening to her old
songs and I was like oh god I remember
this like so vividly so all of her songs
like honey I'm home and a man of mine
don't be stupid whose bed have your
boots been under are just my favorite
okay but she also came out with a new
song so it's like 2017 Shania Twain and
it is called life's about to get good
alright and let me tell you though
so I said a little slow
so I love all her old stuff like the
most but her new songs pretty good too
also been loving smooth by Florida
Georgia line
a plant is act like you don't buy Brooke
Eden
this girl has a voice she is going to be
on and pop it in your radio before you
not like this is what I think this is
the song that took her off but she is so
good like her voice is insane
so those are my country favorites and
