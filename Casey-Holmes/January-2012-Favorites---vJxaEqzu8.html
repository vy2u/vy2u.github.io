my January favorites these are one of my
favorite videos to watch and these are
of course my first one this is of course
my first one I've ever done so I'm
excited to do them um so let's go hang a
star the sun's going down which you can
kind of see the blinds where did it go
like you can see the blinds are kind of
getting all like lining and stuff I
don't know that isn't my game sense but
I don't care so I'm going to start with
face products and I'm going to go ahead
and just do powders the first one is you
guys should probably already know the
NARS um powder and mountain of course
I've hit pan as you can see um this is
my second one I gotta go buy my third
one
it's my holy grail powder I don't have a
Sephora near me so that's the reason why
I went and bought this other favorite
and it's the mac mineralize skinfinish
in medium dark blue just looks like that
um I love the NARS powder because since
I don't work foundation it gives me more
coverage and stuff so it looks really
good and the men are my skin fish one
it's still really good but it doesn't
keep me as mat and like I said isn't
supply as much coverage as the norsu so
um I do still love the NARS when I get
to go to Sephora I'm definitely going to
get it but um the Mac has been really
good ad for an alternative for bronzers
it's definitely been casino I love this
bronzer super dark but it's really
really pretty and not too much um excuse
me I'm sorry I'm still sick for blushes
I have two from Mac and one from NARS
and the one from NARS is in this Dan
Mari palette that I got and it's sin I
love sin I think it's the most gorgeous
color ever um it's just a nice kind of
Mavi color sorry about the sun going
down guys can't control the Sun but um
sin definitely one of my favorites it's
just a go-to blush for me and then um
another one is from Mac and this is
dolly mix I love this blush it just
makes your skin look so nice it is a
sheer tone shimmer but I find that it's
not too shimmery like I hate and
this palette oh my god I hate super
orgasm I hate it I hate it um but I do
love the sheer tones shimmer ones for a
Mac I find that they're not too shimmery
and it's like a fine fine glitter in
there so I love it and then this one you
guys have seen um in my haul and like a
makeup tutorial and it is love rush I
cannot get enough of this blush I'm
wearing it today seriously it's the most
amazing blush I've just been like in all
of it I just love it
um so we're going on to concealers I
before I bought this other favorite I
was using this one like a religion or
like my religion like a religion I don't
know it's the remote perfection
concealer and minds in 3:35 light/medium
seriously you guys if you do not want to
go spend a bunch of money on a really
good concealer I recommend this more
than anything it is gorgeous and it
covers up redness makes your skin look
flawless I mean it's amazing so I do
recommend that but if you want more of a
high-end one and I personally love this
when it covers up dark circles just
brightens up your eyes and it's the
MaxLite cover-up and I'm a 10w30 um I
know I just bought this bag I've been
using this every single day it just
makes my skin look so nice and um it
brings in my eyes so well because when I
get up in the mornings for work
especially this week I've needed some
concealer because I've been so tired and
just like exhausted so I recommend this
one from Mac OH
cannot breathe um for mice Kara's it has
been the covergirl lash perfection and
this is in a very black and then over
top I use this of juice extreme I think
I explained this in my makeup tutorial
but this covergirl one is really great
at getting close to the root and
lengthening and separating your lashes
and then the Estee Lauder one the dogs
are messing up stuff downstairs I swear
every time I film video they have to do
something but this one is really good at
making your lashes very black and thick
and just like BAM so love these two
together they're amazeballs
and then um four lipsticks I have Revlon
soft nude which is just a new that I
cannot get enough of it's just gorgeous
yeah you can't see but it just looks
like that perfect nude does not wash me
out nothing that's why I love it so much
and then I have been in love with cream
Cup just a nice pink lipstick with a
blueish kind undertone I don't know it's
very gorgeous though I'm obsessed with
this lipstick it's gonna look really
great
um it's that one if you can even tell
don't look so amazing in the winter time
and then the last favorite for some
reason I I have not done a tutorial on
this but every time I do my makeup in
the morning there's at least one color
that I go to in this palette if it's um
the black um if it's the highlight if
it's black out or no not black out if
it's busted verb
um not verb what's it yeah verge really
nice too but T's oh my gosh so hey I'm
talking about the Naked 2 palette I keep
going back to this no matter if it's
doing a whole look from this getting a
few colors from it I really do love it
um I do have to admit the black out it
is really good but I just keep going
back to max carbon um because it's so
much easier to blend out and for some
reason it just looks better to me I
don't know um so blackouts really good
to like line my bottom lash line but to
use as like an eyeshadow eyeshadow I've
been loving carbon I can't get enough of
it it's just my favorite black that I
found so yeah I hope you guys enjoy my
January favorites it wasn't much but
that's just basically but what I've been
going back to and stuff and another
thing you guys been asking about the
Paint Pot that you use um been using
this since July June July way back when
in the summer time like right in the
very beginning and it's soft ochre from
Mac it just looks like this it's lighter
than painterly um but once you put like
I shadow on and stuff it just kind of
takes away the color anyway so yeah um
that's it I hope you guys enjoy it and I
will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
