my January favorites and I have quite a
bit of stuff to show you guys that I've
been loving for the month a lot of it is
new items and yeah I'm just really
excited to show you guys so I'm just
gonna go ahead and get started the first
thing is this sponge it is by Real
Techniques and it is their miracle
complexion sponge and I love this I got
also a while back I did a first
impression on it and if you want to see
that video I'll link it down below but
it's about six or seven dollars it's
literally like the best dupe for the
Beauty Blender and it's so accessible at
Ulta I know you can get it online as
well at Ulta calm but I've been using
this non-stop I don't think I've even
touched my Beauty Blender this month
just because I've been so in love with
this guy so next is a set from Tarte
that they're actually launching February
4th and I love this set so much that I
wanted to show it to you guys and share
my thoughts on the products in here with
you just because I think they're amazing
this is by far my favorite set from
Tarte that they've had like on QVC
because every now and then they'll have
like sets on QVC at a really great price
and I'm literally obsessed with
everything in this bag like I love it so
I definitely want to show you guys in
the set you do get the pink bag on QVC
and it's fifty nine and ninety five I
believe and it comes in five different
shades so I'm going to show you guys the
products that come in it and what I love
about them so first off is this primer
this is a Tarte CC which is the colored
clay primer the color I have is deep it
is too dark for me but the thing that I
use this for is to do like a cream
contour so to prime for my bronzers and
I love this I even love this by itself
like if I just want a natural-looking
contour I will just use this and it'll
be good to go I have seen a few people
uses in their right shade and it's
really canceled out their redness and
stuff but since this one's a little too
dark I just use it to cream contour and
I love it and I don't know if you guys
have seen this new colored clay line but
they have this new foundation I think
they call it like a found sealer which
is like a foundation and the concealer
in one I want to try that out so bad but
so far I'm really
this colored clay line it's really nice
and everything stays on very well so
yeah you get a primer in the scent and
then the next thing I was actually
really surprised to see this this is the
Amazonian colored clay liquid foundation
I have it in the color medium and you
wouldn't think this was a foundation at
first I thought it was like a powder
foundation but no it's a liquid
foundation so this is what it looks like
I've been a little messy with mine
because I used a bigger brush too I like
this a lot I have like a little sifter
here so you don't get too much
foundation coming out of the pot and it
doesn't get really messy at all you can
see this is like the stopper for when
you tie it on for when you twist it on
and like stops the foundation right
there so you can even take your
foundation off the top of the lid but I
really like this this is what I'm
wearing now I did do demos on different
products in this video so you'll be
seeing them in the corner and the first
time I ever wore this which I'm showing
you in the demo I forgot to put a primer
on and I never forget primers anymore I
don't know why I forgot about it but I
was so nervous because I was going out
that night that I was like oh well I'll
just see how it wears and it does have a
dewy finish so if you have oily skin I
would definitely set it but I didn't
notice this making me nasty and greasy
throughout the night I did get a little
bit shining right here but that's it
that's without any primer I didn't have
a mattifying primer on or anything so
that's really good it stayed on all
night it looked flawless my blush my
bronzer and my highlight we're just so
great I mean I'm really loving this
product I think this is like a new
favorite foundation and I love how it's
packaged I just I love it all wearing it
now and I feel like it just gives you a
nice airbrushed look so I use this brush
that comes in the set to apply it as
well and I really like this it's like a
little mini kabuki it's nice and dense
but it's also angled it's really easy
just to kind of Pat it on and blend it
in as you go and it's a really
lightweight brush so I really like that
to a part as well and then you guys know
the main reason why I love this set is
because there's so many face products
and I'm such a face product junkie that
I'm like yes I love this whole thing but
this is the new blush they're coming out
with this the Amazonian colored clay
bronzer blush in pink bronze this is
such a cute packaging but this blush is
literally
right up my alley it's bronze it's pink
everything I want to blush this is it it
lasts all night and it looks beautiful
on the skin as you can see in the demo
love this blush is perfect I have no bad
things to say about it at all you also
get their really well-known torques like
camera lashes mascara I've been really
enjoying this really nice it gives you a
lot of volume and make sure lashes look
really nice and full now this eyeliner
has to be my new favorite eyeliner and
it came in the set as well it's the
Tarte colored clay eyeliner in black
this eyeliner sets very quickly I used
it in the demo to line my upper lash
line and smudge it out and then went
ahead and lined both eyes and smudged
out one eye or when I went to the other
eye it was kind of hard to you know
blend it out because it set so quickly
that's a really great thing I feel like
you can just do one at a time you know
you'll do you can line one eye and blend
it out at that same time and then go to
the next die but I love this for my
waterline it doesn't smudge it lasts all
day I wore this again that night out and
I didn't have to touch up at all and it
looked really awesome so this one has to
be right up there with my NARS eyeliner
because they both stay really really
well and I have very watery eyes oily
eyelids all of that and I had no
problems with this one and then this is
the last thing that you get in a set
which I didn't do a demo because I
didn't wear a red lip but if I wear a
red lip is as well I'll top it off with
is the Tarte true love lips Sergent lip
gloss I actually have it's washed right
here for you this is so pigmented I love
this it's a really pretty kind of like a
pinky red color with some shimmer in it
and if you have like a matte red lip on
you could put this on in the center of
your lips and it would make your lips
look really nice and plump so I think
this is a gorgeous shade like I said
it's very pigmented and it doesn't have
a bad smell or anything I mean it smells
fine to me it kind of smells a little
bit like matte but yeah you guys if you
want to check this out I think it does
it goes live on February 4th for that
59.95 price leave the link down below
not what I used to set that tart
foundation since it is kind of dewy is
this NYX blotting powder and I think
this is new it was set up with the other
new NYX products at Ulta and I love this
this isn't
medium dark and it does have quite a bit
of Fallout but it makes you so matte and
it keeps you map for a really long time
so this is like my new favorite powder
right now I've been using it non-stop
I'll use it at home when I set my makeup
and I just bring it along with me just
in case I do need to do a little bit of
touch-ups okay next is another
foundation this is a Neutrogena skin
clearing oil-free makeup I love this
this is perfect with my it cosmetics bye
bye redness which I'm also been using a
ton this is another favorite of mine I
like to take just a little bit of this
and apply it over my redness and then
put any foundation over top just to make
it look extra flawless this has like a
medium coverage and it's not exactly
what I want without the by by redness
but it leaves your skin so beautiful
these two combined it leaves you kind of
like a natural satin finish so it's not
super matte unless you want to set it
like I do but it doesn't make me really
it just it looks really great on the
skin I'm in the color honey beige and I
do have a NARS pump on the top of this
okay next is a blush this is the Milani
blush in Luminoso this just makes your
skin look so healthy and glowy you don't
have to have a highlighter with this and
I just I love it it's super smooth it's
very pigmented and this has been raved
about a lot on YouTube just because it's
so amazing I also have one from Sigma
you guys know I love the blush called
serene by Sigma and I've been recently
trying this one out a lot more this is
called mellow and I'm in love first of
all they are super smooth they blend
like a dream I have a demo of this as
well and it's what I have on today it's
just like a darker natural color and I I
love it I have nothing bad to say about
it Sigma blushes are awesome I love how
compact it is and it's just great I love
this shape been using it a lot this
month okay next I want to talk about a
highlighter this is a newer purchase
that I made in January and it's from the
Mac magnetic natural line I'll leave
what it is right here because I can
literally never remember the name of it
but if the highlighter called superb
I've been using this so much I also have
this on my chopped the top of my
cheekbones today and usually I don't
like
pinkey highlighters this does have a
little bit of pink in it but it doesn't
bother me at all I think it looks really
nice and I just I'm like obsessed with
it this is my first extra dimension skin
finish I also got the one in magnetic
appeal but I use that as a blush and it
wasn't used a lot this month like this
one was the recommend this highlighter
if you can still get your hands on it
I know Nordstrom might have more Macy's
might have some online so definitely
check that out okay for eyeshadows I
have two little things I have this lorac
pro mini palette that I got this set
from Ulta and I'll try to find the set
on the Ulta website and link it down
below for you because it came with a
bunch of great products but you have to
match stage you have a dark matte Brown
which is expresso you have a light brown
which is called light brown and then you
have like this beige color which it's a
shimmery beige I have light brown in my
crease today with beige as my
highlighter and then have another shadow
that about to shove you on my eyes as
well but I've been loving this palette
it's literally been my go-to it's so
little so easy to work with so the other
shadow I've been using this is like my
everyday kind of look if I'm not doing a
tutorial or something I've also been
using this bobbi brown eyeshadow the
camel I saw Jacqueline Hill talk about
this in her last favorites video and I
had to go get this shadow because I love
the shade and I'm like obsessed with it
now I love the way it looks on my brown
eyes especially mixed with the colors in
here it is just so pretty
I love it like I can't get enough of
this color okay next is an eyeliner this
is the L'Oreal 12 hour and fallible
super slim liquid eyeliner this is an
amazing dark matte
eyeliner the felt tip is really really
thin so it's easy to get a nice flicked
out winged eyeliner and drag it in and
it's just been my go-to I definitely
recommend this liner over any other
drugstore one that I tried because it's
awesome like it's everything I want a
liner it's got a thin thin felt tip so
it's easy to work with and the pin is
really thin as well so it's kind of like
you're just drawing on your eyes okay
next is my brows and then we got lips
and then we're done so I've been using
my Anastasia brow Wiz in medium ash
down a couple shades just because I went
a little bit lighter with my hair so I
want to go a little bit lighter with the
brow products and I've been using this
Sigma medium brow powder and I love this
I'll line up my brows with my Anasazi
eyebrows and then fill them in with this
powder I use the liner shade basically
on the inner part of my brow and then
the darker one for the outer half and I
love it this is just an easy product to
work with I love the fact that they have
two different shades in here so you
don't have to go reach for a darker
powder you just have it all in one
little set so this has been a go-to for
me and I think I'm gonna do my brow
routine with this and the Anasazi abroad
with because my brow products changed
quite a bit because I like experimenting
with different stuff but I think I'm
liking this the best so far so we'll see
okay for lips I've been loving my
Jordana liner lip liner and tawny this
is just a gorgeous darker natural shade
it lasts a long time on me and it
doesn't tug at my lips or anything and I
believe it's like a couple dollars not
even so been loving that on the two
lipsticks that have been really great
this month have been the NYX butter
lipstick in a snow cap these are new
that came out this month as well I do
believe this is like a gorgeous pinky
nude shade I have to say when you do
apply these you have to kind of build up
the color at least I feel like you have
to to really get a true opaque shade but
once you do it's a gorgeous color I love
the way it looks I love the way it feels
on the lips and I think it's a great
shade and this is the only one that I
picked up from the butter line because
none of the other ones really appealed
to me and you guys know I'm a nude lip
junkie I can't get enough
speaking of nude this is from again that
magnetic nude collection from Mac this
was the lipstick in close comfort and
this is going to be gone soon because I
can't stop using it it's like my go-to
right now I just I love it it's this is
like a color that they need to make
permanent because it's a perfect nude
it's not too dark it's not too light
it's right there in the middle a nice
kind of brown nude and then favorite lip
gloss of the month is another nude I
never experiment but this is the whiting
lightening color your smile lighted lip
gloss and nude and I've seen a ton of
we'll use this and I was just like I
don't know it just looks like a new
gloss right but this lip gloss is
stunning this is a swatch of it right
there it is so pigmented you can use
this by itself or you can top a lipstick
off with this and it's just like such a
gorgeous nude I have this combo on my
lips right now and I think I have coupon
codes for this I'm not sure I know I got
coupon codes for the doll smell that I
mentioned in my last favorites video but
if I have a coupon code for this I'll
link it down below I think it's like 70%
off your purchase there just check down
below and I'll have some info for you
guys and then I have two kind of random
things the first thing is this
Victoria's Secret number two night
jasmine limited edition perfume I got
this at the semi-annual sale and I just
love the way it smells it's like a sweet
scent but it's not too sweet it's like a
very mature sweet scent and I love it if
you have the opportunity to get this I
would definitely pick it up because I
got the body spray at first and I loved
it so much that I was like I have to go
back and get the perfume and I think I
got this for like eight or ten dollars I
can't remember but this has been
definitely my go-to perfume for the
month the last thing I want to talk
about is a website that I've been using
and they did not contact me you tell me
to talk about them anything like that I
found them through YouTube and basically
it's called Ebates I know a lot of
people use it but I never understood the
concept until about Christmastime
because I wanted to mention them in my
last favorites video but I had so much
going on that I forgot
but Ebates is an awesome site I use that
for Christmas and like in January when I
was shopping and I have like over two
hundred dollars in my Ebates account and
basically what it is is you shop through
their site so you go to ebay comm and
sign up it's like it doesn't cost
anything and you shop different sites
from them and like Sephora I think it's
always eight percent cash back which I
love Sephora so I'm always like yes I
have to go and get my a percent cash
back and at first you think like oh it's
not a lot of money but it adds up really
quickly and you're basically shopping
through them to get money back I mean I
also
when I saw over $200 in my little money
that I got back or whatever and it was
the first time using it so I mean I love
that site now I will not shop without it
and I want to mention it to you guys
like I said they didn't tell me to
mention them they're not paying me to
mention them or anything like that but I
just think it's a really cool site and I
would definitely check it out if you're
like me and you online shop a lot and
you want to kind of save some money as
well so that is it I hope you guys
enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up if you liked it and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel for
more videos and I will have a
Valentine's Day and makeup tutorial
coming to you guys next so just stay
tuned for that and I will see you guys
in my next one bye
