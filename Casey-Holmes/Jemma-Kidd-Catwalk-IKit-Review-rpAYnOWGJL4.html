pilot review for you guys and it is on
the Jimmy K catwalk I kit um I always go
into target but I always skip the gym a
kid and like pixie sections and um I did
go by the Jimmy k1 a couple days ago and
I saw this and I decided to pick it up
because it seemed really interesting and
I looked at the colors and they were
just right down my alley so I had to
pick them up so go ahead and get started
this is the box that comes in and of
course as a sticker that says how to
guide inside and then on the back it
just tell you what the palette contains
how much and then up here is just like
some little sentences they decide to put
together and then on the inside is your
kind of how-to guide this tells you all
about it pretty much and then over here
you have your basic paper tutorial which
i think is really great because if
you're not like really good with makeup
and stuff or don't really know where to
apply certain colors then this can help
you and totally navigate you through
this palette so I thought that was
pretty cool so let's get onto it this is
the palette and you can see it looks
just like the box is just shinier and
without the sticker and then on the back
you have a diagram of all the shadows
inside and it also includes how much is
in it in the little pans so first off I
love how big this mirror is it is huge
I'm just like obsessed with it it is
like a ginormous so I love big mirrors
because I'm doing my makeup I like to
kind of resort to smaller mirrors to
just look at that resort to smaller
mirrors to um you know just get closer
up to my eye instead of like looking at
my faraway mirror you know that's like
the final version and this you kind of
have to work with and get the you know
what I mean like that's like the final
look this is your working look you know
what I mean like when you're working on
your makeup you look at this I don't
know you know what I mean so I love the
fact that it's a really big mirror and
I'm gonna go ahead and go through all
these with you this is your prep and
prime your basic eye primer and then
down here you got to highlight shadows
you have Vogue and Elle then over here
you have oh no I'm sorry
this one's Ellen this one's vogue yeah
this one's about
and then this is in season uber game
Zimmern and black this is a liner and a
shadow a period Vanity Fair vintage and
editor so they're really pretty colors
they all work so amazing together these
colors are just ones that I gravitate
more towards when I'm doing my everyday
makeup or like doing a really nice smoky
eye and what I love about this is you
can do a nice daytime look or you could
totally let's just smoke everything out
and make it a dramatic look so I love
that all these colors work together and
they're just oh so pretty and so
pigmented so um I'm going to show you
the highlights real quick so they're
just your basic highlights you have one
kind of a white highlight and another
one's kind of just more of a champagne
color and then they do this they're very
pigmented and really nice to like blend
out like they're not hard at all to
blend out especially especially the
black it's really nice so of course you
have and season autogain shimmer and
black so that's those very pigmented
then we're gonna do the top row and then
let's see which one okay this one's
editor vintage and Vanity Fair so yeah I
really really really love these colors I
do have them on my eyes today definitely
one my favorite palettes I also like the
fact that doesn't have a bunch of face
stuff in it because I find when
companies you know put a lot of face
products in especially little products
like lip glosses and stuff I never use
them like they're just not my type of
colors you know and it's very rare that
they put like a really nice nude it so I
like this is basically an all eye
palette it's just really really great I
love the colors I can't stress enough
how much I love this palette it is $26
but I feel like it's worth it especially
for me because these are just the colors
that I gravitate towards and use pretty
much every day so I really really love
them and I totally recommend it so if
you have this kit or your going to pick
it up and you do get it let me know how
you like it um and let me see some like
tutorials like do video responses I
never get those actually I've gotten
like a few but I think they're really
cool like show me you using this I don't
know I think it'd be fun so we can all
kind of see you know it's great to have
other viewers see other ways you can use
this palette and how different people
apply the shadows which colors they use
together and all that stuff so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial of
this little eye kit and I'll see you on
the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
