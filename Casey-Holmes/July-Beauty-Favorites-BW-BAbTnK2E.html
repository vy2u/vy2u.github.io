favorites and we are finally through the
month of July well not finally because
I'm not really happy about it because I
mean summer is almost over
but you know it's another month and
we're getting close to fall so I'm kind
of excited for fall but anyways so of
course a new month means a new favorites
video which are my favorites to film and
I thought I would just show you guys
some of the makeup parts I've been using
this month I haven't been using a lot of
different things actually a lot of this
is Mac so sorry I've been using so much
Mac stuff lately I've just been on a Mac
binge I guess I don't know it's been
crazy
but I do have a couple other drugstore
products in here and some body products
that I want to show you guys so I'm just
going to get started with the makeup
first and the first thing I'm going to
talk about is something I have been
using literally every time I do my
makeup this month this kit is going on
my brows and then is the brow bar to go
from whitening lightening I talked about
this before I do have a coupon code for
them down below if you're interested for
70% off but I have been up sets with
this I was using my Tarte brow mousse a
lot and then I kind of just felt like I
mean to use this more so in the
beginning of the month I started using
it and I was like why did I ever stop
using it I have it on my brows today and
I've been using this dark brown color so
much that it looks like it's about to
hit pan like I'm not even kidding and I
use this lighter shade as well if I need
to kind of fill in a little bit more
with my brows but I don't want to go
with the dark brown color and then of
course the wax is what I use to set my
brows with I lost my tweezerman brow
mousse which I'm really upset about
because I love that stuff but I have
been using this and it's kept my brows
in place amazingly because they like to
go wild and just have a party on my face
to go along with that I have been using
this concealer palette from Mac this is
the pro conceal and correct palette in
medium I have talked about this a lot on
my channel ever since I got it I have
just been using it so much I used the NW
25 to really make my eyebrows nice and
sharp and to do that I use my Sigma 815
flat definer brush you guys all know
Sigma
doing a 20% off coupon code until Monday
so I'll leave that down below if you're
interested but I thought it was till
Friday and then I guess they extended it
till Monday I don't know but anyway so I
use this for my brows even with the
powder so I going with this first and
then I'll just dust off the powder and
then go in with this concealer and align
my brows I've also been loving this
darker pink shade over here which is in
c35 I've been using that to contour my
nose more I feel like it just blends a
lot better than a powder does and then
I've also been using this one to conceal
on my face as well so this palette has
just gotten some love this month okay
really quickly I want to talk about a
couple other brushes first one is a
snack 1 2 9 which is a blush brush I
have been using this a lot for my blush
lately and I really like it it does shed
but I just love how fluffy it is and it
just blends really really well so this
is a Mac one tonight and then this has
been my all-time favorite brush this
month so ever since I purchased it
online
I was waiting by the door for this to
come in because I was ready to use it
and I've been dying to have this brush
in my life if the Mac 134 brush this is
an expensive brush I'm not gonna lie to
you it was expensive I don't even want
to tell you the price but um it's the
one 34 and do you see how big it is oh
it's so Muffy it's really soft it's huge
and I love it you can use it for powder
I've been using it for bronzer lately I
haven't specifically been just
contouring my cheeks at all I've just
been bronzing my face with this brush
and another favorite which is the Mac
mineralize skinfinish and give me Sun
which I've had for a good couple years
now and I just felt like I needed to
really start using it more so I love
this and I also was using Lagoona but I
have found that I love this bronzer a
lot more I feel like it blends a lot
better and it just looks better on my
skin so Matt give me Sun with the Mac
134 has been great of course you can use
any kind of bigger powder brush you want
to use last brush is this Real
Techniques brush from Samantha Sherman
my writings coming off and this is the
expert face brush I've been using this
from foundation quite a bit these past
couple
and I just got a really like it I think
it's such a great little brush it's
dense but not too dense so it still
blends out your foundation really well
and I think it's just awesome even if
you want to kind of blend out your
contour and blush you can go back in
with this brush and do that as well so I
really like this brush it's been really
good and then of course I have to
mention this I've been using my Beauty
Blender a lot this month of course for
foundation as well and a lot of times
for concealer underneath my eyes I still
use my Sigma F 86 brush for my under
eyes but I use this to just kind of you
know do the finishing touch and really
set it into my skin moving on I'm going
to show you two blushes I've been using
a lot of course Alpine bronze from Mac
this was limited edition so I'm sorry
but I love this blush is so pretty such
a bronze shade and I think it's awesome
so been using that a lot but the one
I've been using even more than that is
this one by Mac it's called honey
jasmine I think this is a permanent
color I've been seeing it in the permit
like section of Mac it might not be I
might be crazy but it's really gorgeous
it's a peachy orange and it's a satin
finish and I feel like it just makes you
look even more summery I don't know if
it's even a right way to say it but I
just feel like it really warms up my
skin and makes me look healthy I really
like this blush I think it goes with a
lot of different looks too the next is a
blush that in the actual using as a
highlighter and I don't remember who I
saw using this as a highlighter but she
did and it looked gorgeous on her
and it's the L'Oreal Paris visible lift
colorless blush then the color rolls
gold lifts and this would never be a
blush for me especially if your oily
this would not be a good blush but as a
highlight it is beautiful it reflects
the light really well I got this towards
the beginning of the month and I've been
using as my highlight lately and I
really like it so go check that out if
you haven't yet and it has a cool
texture like when you press down on it
it's kind of like spongy feeling I don't
know
I'm gonna talk about two new liners I'm
using you guys know I love my liners and
the first one is a liquid one and this
is from Jordana this is in the pin form
it's the fabula now this is so good you
guys I am obsessiveness so easy to work
with and it's so easy time your upper
lash line with this and make a really
thin line I didn't think it was going to
because it had such a big like tip on it
it's super black as well which I love
and it lasts all day I personally love
these Jordana liners like any liner
I've tried from Jordana I've really been
loving and I totally recommend them cuz
they're like a couple dollars and I got
mine at Walgreens because I finally
found where Jordana is in Walgreens so
that's where I got mine and then I want
to mention this Sigma eyeliner and boost
is the extendable or extend wear
eyeliner I've been using this on my
waterline like my upper waterline and
sometimes my lower waterline and I just
love it it glides on beautifully it
stays on for a very long time and I
think it's a really really great
eyeliner and for me it's hard to find
ones that don't smudge this one doesn't
smudge on me at all either so and this
one goes on a lot smoother than the
covergirl ink it eyeliner that I
mentioned that doesn't smudge this one
goes on a little bit creamier but it
still has that awesome staying power so
I recommend checking that out and I
forgot to mention this brush this is
Sigma tapered blending 825 I recently
purchased this the beginning of this
month or something and I have the black
one that's the e25 but I saw that they
had a white hair brush and I wanted to
try it out so I'm really really like in
this brush a lot it's gorgeous and it
blends like your crease color and
everything so so well okay the last
makeup product is actually a sample that
I got from Sephora it's the YSL baby
doll mascara I hate that I like this
because it's so dang expensive but it's
a great sample to have and I really
recommend this it's so good my lashes
look amazing I can't even tell you guys
I just love it it holds the curl all day
and I'm like oh I don't need to like you
because you're so expensive but I love
that I got a sample of this and I'm
I purchase it I don't know I have a lot
of mascaras I need to use before I
purchase this but it's a really great
one and if you can get a sample of this
I would definitely recommend you trying
it out so this is a self tanner I'm
using for a few weeks now and I really
love it I have gotten compliments on how
tan again I use this I walked in the
work the next day and the girl was like
you are so tan did you go there spray
tan did you go get this I like no I'm
just using a new self-tanner and it's
the million dollar tan cabana tan
extreme this is the lotion no no I have
tried to spray wasn't a big fan of the
spray I thought it was kind of hard to
apply but this lotion is where it's at I
love it I definitely recommend gloves
because if you seen my names in my
previous videos they were really dry and
I forgot to wash them off and it claimed
really back to my knuckles this is such
a great self tanner
it literally lasts for so long I haven't
self tan in like a week even though I
really need to go back and sell tan
again because it's starting to fade but
I mean do you see how dark my chest and
stuff is and that's for like a week
that's amazing and I love it it is a
clear self tanner so it's like a white
consistency like lotion but as long as
you use gloves and you act like you're
putting lotion on it'll go beautifully
and you won't have any streaks I haven't
had any problems with streaks or
anything like that on my body so I
highly recommend it and I will have a
coupon code for you guys if you are
interested down below speaking of dry
hands I repurchase this and I'm thanking
the Lord that I did it's the it's the
soap &amp;amp; Glory righteous body butter and I
have had this before and I mention it in
a product I used up video and said I
loved it and I don't know why I just
didn't repurchase it I think it's
because I was trying different lotions
and stuff but with my hands being as dry
as they have been because I've been
washing them so much I was like okay I
need to go back to this and I have been
using it a lot and I literally just got
this like a few days ago but I know I
love it so I wanted to mention it in
this video and just show you guys how
much of use of it it just sinks into
your skin so amazingly and
like that gross feeling on you and it
leaves you smelling so good I just I
love it
you can get a Sephora and then I want to
mention two hair tools and I am done for
the video so the first one is my new me
25 millimeter one now you guys know I
always use the 32 millimeter one all the
time
it gives me those really big waves if
you don't know what they look like I
will link a video down below where you
can check it out but I have been using
the 25 millimeter one a lot this month I
just love the kind of tighter curls it
gives and then when I sleep on it and
wake up in the morning it really does
give that gorgeous kind of beach wave
effect so I really like this and then I
want to mention what I used with my hair
today
it's the nume megastar flat iron this is
by far a ten times better than my studio
when I used to use I love this
straightener it just glides through my
hair it makes my hair so shiny my hair
is not tangling at all and it looks just
so good I cannot say enough good things
about this though since this has rounded
edges you can curl your hair very easily
with this and it's just so convenient so
I love this and I will have coupon codes
for both of these down below you get
$115 off and I forget how much off this
one but I know it's a good decent amount
you're gonna get off so I'll leave those
coupons down below if you're interested
and I want to show you guys how long my
hair has gotten because every time I
straighten it I'm like oh my god you see
how long that is no extensions are
nothing this is all my hair oh my gosh
it was gotten so long it needs a trim
but I'm pretty excited about how long my
hair is right now so that was it for my
favorites this month I hope you guys
enjoyed it I know it wasn't a lot of
different things but I have been using
these products so much I just can't get
enough of them and I will leave all the
links down below and also coupon codes

stuff and the million dollar tan all
that I will leave everything down below
