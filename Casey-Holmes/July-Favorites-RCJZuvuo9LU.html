it did kind of say distributes a mega
thing yes yes yes yes yes done in nasty
hey guys so today's video is going to be
my July favorites and I decided to go
ahead and get this video up for you guys
I know it's a little early honestly I
have so many other videos that I'm
working on that I want to get out for
you next week so just keep an eye out
for one of them is that Kim Kardashian
tutorial I told you about in my last
video so yeah that's why it's a little
early but I figured it better early than
never
okay so the first thing I've been loving
are these shoes I do have two fashion
items for you this month but these shoes
are amazing they're from Zara and if you
follow me on instagram you've probably
seen them a couple times
that's from Knoxville Thank You
Tennessee but I really really love these
they're so adorable like I said they're
super comfortable and I love like the
laser-cut detail of them they're just
super cute so these are my first
favorites so the next pair of shoes look
like this and I absolutely love these
shoes I love the chunky heel and a laser
cut detail and I actually got these off
an app called the hunt which I know a
lot of you heard about I heard a lot
about it as well
I was super interested in it and I
actually loved it it's perfect if you're
a Shopaholic like myself and always
looking for different outfits because
sometimes you go to different sites and
they don't have the links to anything so
what you can do is take a picture of it
or screenshot it and you can just post
it on the hunt and people will try to
help you find those items I actually
found this on like I'm gonna call it the
explore page I can't I don't know what
you would necessarily call it but it's
like a random collage of different
peoples finds and this is one of the
items it had like seven finds I think it
was so I went to one of the random web
sites and purchased this because I just
loved it so I'm gonna see if I can find
the site for this and put it down below
and if you guys are in
like I said I'm on that app so go follow
me at Casey Holmes I'll leave the link
and everything down below so make sure
you download it and come follow me and
me and the hunt did partner up so we
could give one of my followers $100
Sephora gift card so go down below
follow me I'll have all the contest
rules down below if you're interested in
winning under gift card to one of our
favorite places right okay moving on to
something a little bit random but
necessary and the woman world this is
the Bliss fuzz off facial hair removal
cream now I've never mentioned anything
like this on my channel but honestly I
love this I decided to try this out I
was a little nervous because let's be
real I've tried in there and stuff and
it just was not good like oh my god it
just burned and then he would take off
the hair but anyway that's a different
story this is perfect for your upper lip
if you just have some fuzz you want to
get off
so I'll just apply it wait about three
minutes literally all you need is three
minutes so you know don't leave it on
there for ten minutes now because you'll
be burning and literally it leaves your
upper lip super smooth hair free it does
sing a little bit the sensation goes
away within like a few minutes so I love
this it's your if you're interested in a
hair removal cream or your face
this one is perfect I'm interesting like
a ton of random things in the beginning
of this video but there's just my
favorite okay so the next one is a Mac
brush this is the Mac kabuki brush I
think this was from my collection I
don't know which one I actually got this
at ICICI Oh in Tennessee when I was
visiting Amanda but literally this is
the softest brush of life like I can't
deal with it I love this brush it's the
perfect size and it blends bronzer like
a dream that's what I use it for and you
can also use it to blend down like your
breath your blush and stuff like that
but this is perfect if you guys can find
this at your CCO I definitely recommend
picking it up because it's amazing okay
so one more random product and then
we'll be heading on to makeup this is
the matrix by Lodge Hydra source hydro
steel spray for dry hair now this
product I kind of thought at first okay
it's probably like water in a bottle
it's not gonna do much for me I'm sorry
about my nail
so haven't got a fix I've really been
loving biologic products lately and I
really like this for when I get out of
the shower and right before I blow dry I
put my hair products in so this is
actually the first thing I'll apply I'll
just do three sprays on each side
because I do split my hair in half
before I blow-dry it and this stuff
makes my hair super soft at the ends and
it just doesn't feel crispy or dry or
anything like that I just I love it and
it smells the same at the biologic amp
whose and conditioner so of course I
freaking love that smell
I do have fine hair it's just really
thick so I do like this but I would
recommend for if you have hair like mine
I would probably recommend about two or
three sprays if you have thin and fine
hair I would do like maybe one and a
half sprays like one or two sprays
because I feel like it's super smooth
that it could possibly get your ends a
little too greasy if you're not careful
so just spray it and brush it through
and it distributes it really nicely and
I just love it okay the next product
we're moving on to makeup now this is
the hourglass and mineral veil primer
it's oil free and has SPF 15 in it and I
love this product I actually had two
samples of it from Sephora it was like
two-point perks and they're a pretty
good size and I used two both of them up
and I was kind of like iffy on buying
the full size because it is pretty
expensive but I figured since I use
those up I would go ahead and just
purchase the bad-boy and I really like
it it makes my makeup apply so smooth
and nice and I just I love it it keeps
everything on all day and I like to use
this with my Smashbox photo matte primer
and it's like the perfect combo I
haven't been using anything else lately
but I really like this and I definitely
think it's worth the money otherwise I
would have never spend the money on this
thing it's really really good okay
moving on to newer items I have this
NARS eyeshadow in Himalaya I have been
using this non-stop this month I got it
probably that in the last month and
literally this has been what I'm using
non-stop so this is that color it is so
pretty you can see I've been ruining the
design because I can't keep my hands off
of it and I literally will use this
at anytime look a nighttime look if I'm
going for more of a side for my finger
you guys if I'm going for more of a
daytime look I'll use this color all
over the lid and a brown script in the
crease and it is beautiful you guys know
I love Brown script so so these two
together are just absolutely stunning
and if I'm going for more of a nighttime
look I'll also use brown script in the
crease but then deepen out the V with
like either a super dark brown or a
black and it just looks beautiful you
see that I mean oh my gosh they're so
pigmented this is my first NARS
eyeshadow that I've ever had and at
first I was like I want all of the
colors because the new shades are
beautiful but I ended up just going with
this one because I didn't know how often
I would use a single hi shadow and since
I've used this so much I bought five
more the struggle
check these out you guys Himalaya so far
is by far when my favorites now for
eyeliner I do have this Maybelline eye
studio gel liner in a blackest black
this is just what it looks like in this
cute jar I've heard so many things about
this for the longest time and I've been
looking for a new gel liner and I think
I'm going to stick to this one for a
while because I really love it I have it
on my eyes today and I just love the
fact that it stays put I don't
I think they claim that this is
waterproof I don't think it's waterproof
but it is pretty difficult to get off
but it is very very black it's the
blackest drugstore gel liner I have
found and by far the easiest one to work
with so this is amazing I highly
recommend it I look at my hands to just
look so like ratchet like this hand has
this ugly thing on it but the nails are
done and then this one there's now not
done and so like I'm screwed either way
right I did not know elf had polish
palettes for like the longest time until
I ordered from them like a few weeks ago
maybe a month or so ago and these are
amazing they have two shades they have
one palette in light and one and dark
and you also get this huge mirror wait
where am I at Heather but you get this
really huge mirror as well so it's
perfect and the blush that I really love
from this palette is this one right here
it's the only one I've really used
anyways but it's just a gorgeous like
rosy pink makes you look super healthy
and just I love it I had this
in my last video which was my drugstore
vs. high-end video I'll leave it down
below if you want to check it out but
you can see how creamy and pigmented it
is it's beautiful and I felt like this
lasted for so long so definitely check
out these elf palette blushes and if
you're interested these do like pop out
I don't necessarily know why they pop
out but they like pop out like the Bobbi
Brown blushes and eyeshadows do okay
I've just a few more things to show you
guys I have been using a new brow
product I've had this in my drawer for
ever I think since Christmas time and I
just broke it out within the past month
and a half this is a two-faced
bulletproof brows and Universal brunette
now this is a different kind of
packaging but I love this so you just
open up the lid and then you have this
like little casing over the top of it so
you just pop this open and then you have
your product here on the inside so this
is what universal brunette looks like
and I think it's the perfect shade for
me and this is just great I love the
fact that you have this over the top
just so the product doesn't dry out
quickly and you get a ton of product
with this so I definitely recommend
checking them out this is like one of my
new favorite cream products ever it's
just so easy to work with and I love the
shade so much okay so the next thing is
this Dior lip gloss this is in the shade
or it's a liquid lipstick or whatever
what's it called a fluid stick and this
is in the shade 219 whisper beige first
off look at that packaging hello hello
oh so fancy I kind of cried a little bit
whenever I bought it and I'm just
kidding but it was really expensive and
I'm kind of like cringe but once I got
in saw the color I was like yes yes yes
yes yes so once you open it up it just
pops up like that ready to go and then
you have this off an applicator at the
end I really really enjoy it and I want
to show you guys just one swipe of this
that's one swipe of this product and it
is just so amazingly pigmented the color
is perfect I actually have it on my lips
right now over a nude lipstick now when
I first tried this on I was kind of
taken aback because
it literally feels super cooling on the
list and it feels like water like it
doesn't feel like I having sticky lip
gloss whatsoever it's very very creamy
and just be careful with it you don't
want to apply too much because then
it'll kind of get everywhere you don't
need a lot of this at all the color is
just so pigmented and I love the formula
of this and it stays on for a really
long time I've had this on for probably
like 30 minutes to an hour which I feel
like is great for a lip gloss the last
thing I want to mention is actually my
thumb case this is from a time los
angeles i believe the girl that Reznor
her name is Ashley I'm pretty positive I
love this phone case you guys I've
gotten so many compliments on it it's
just like the cutest thing if you're a
makeup addict I feel like you would love
this as well and another thing that I
really love about it is that it comes
around the corners of the iPhone so if
you drop it face-first it's not going to
crack as easily so this has saved my
life like seriously and it's just super
sleek so I love this especially my black
iPhone is just like blacked out if I
have this laying somewhere in my house
like I can't find it sometimes because
it's all black and I'm just like where's
my iPhone she doesn't know I'm
mentioning her but I love her site her
tops are super cute I've been following
her on Instagram for forever now and her
website so I'll leave the all their
links down below so you guys can check
them out because they have really cute
stuff if you're into makeup okay guys so
