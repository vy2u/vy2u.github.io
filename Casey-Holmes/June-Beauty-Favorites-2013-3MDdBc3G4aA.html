my favorites video and these are my
favorites to film so of course I'm
excited to film it for you so the first
thing I'm going to talk about is makeup
of course it's my favorite thing and
really quickly I want to mention what I
have on my lips it is a line crimes list
stick in a contest fluorescent and this
is such a beautiful color now I dig in
few things from Lime Crime and I
actually did blog post on it and it
swatches and a little bit of a review on
there so if you want to see that then go
check out my blog down below I posted
just the other day anyways I'm really
loving those even though I just got them
I think they're amazing amazing
lipsticks now moving on to some more
lipsticks that are pretty amazing
these Milani ones in the gold tube I
actually just did a video using two of
these I used fruit punch in new cream
I'll do a close-up on these but they're
so pretty they're so creamy and very
bright I have the colors nude cream
fruit punch in rose hip I've been trying
to get my hands on Flamingo pose but I
can't find it anywhere my CVS has been
sold out every time I go in there so
these are the ones I have right now your
creamy they smell like watermelon and
they look really really amazing on lips
eye so far I think this is the best
drugstore lipstick formula I've ever
tried I think they're like only five or
six dollars they're pretty inexpensive
okay another thing I want to mention is
this matte blush and right below I have
it on today I love this color I think it
was just so pretty this was from the
temperature rising collection and it's
just so pretty it's kind of like a coral
pink color it's very pigmented and just
so pretty on the skin I think it glides
on very very smoothly and it blends out
perfectly next thing I want to just
quickly mention I think I shared this in
my last favorites but it's this Tarte
brow mousse and it's the waterproof kind
and the color I have is in medium brown
I absolutely love this I think it's dope
anything I haven't tried with the pool
or anything because I personally don't
wear makeup when I go to the pool but
through sweat and everything
that I think this is perfect it lasts
all day on me and I love the way it
makes my brows look and the little duo
brush thing that it comes like excuse my
wrist they look worse on camera but the
little duo brush that it comes with is
amazing as well
I actually got mine when they were on
her look and I think it was about twelve
eight to twelve dollars I think so
really really good price the next thing
I want to mention is this stay matte but
not flat powder foundation I love this
it's so good it's just a perfect
foundation it's perfect but over the
Guarnere BB cream which I won't mention
here in a minute but it is a little
light for me so I just use this in the
center parts of my face but it's still
really good and this is in the color
soft beige and I don't ever find this to
be cakey it really just makes the skin
look nice and flawless now speaking of
the BB cream I of course love this I did
a whole video on it and I will link that
down below if you're interested the
Garnier BB cream I have the light to
medium in the medium to dark I think
this is great covers amazingly on my
skin my redness it's just really
camouflage when I use this excuse my ol
under control and applied with the mix
stay matte but not flat powder it's a
perfect combo I just want to mention my
mary-lou manizer from the balm and I
mentioned this in my last video and I
think I've come to the conclusion that I
do like this more than my soft and
gentle skin finish from Mac I use this a
lot more I think it's just such a
beautiful color it's liars my skin tone
a lot more and I feel like it doesn't
make me look shiny in a bad way the balm
likes to come on foot look a lot - I
think I got this for eight dollars so
I'll leave a link down below where you
can check it out but it's just every
once in a while you just have to catch
them when they go on their next I just
want to quickly talk about this it's
nothing crazy but I think it's the best
gloss this is a Rimmel stay glossy gloss
it's in clear and if it's up
you up to six hours shine and I really
like this I like this four colors like
I'm right now I don't like to go out and
buy lip glosses for each color and
that's kind of wasteful and just not my
thing so I like to take clear glosses
and just top them over the lipsticks
because half the time I like the way my
lipstick looks anyways so yeah this was
in seduce me and I use it for colored
lipsticks and I know some people
probably grossed out value use it for
different colors but it works so I love
this little gloss next thing is this
covergirl ink it eyeliner oh my gosh you
guys if you have a hard time with
eyeliner smudging on your waterline and
just getting all over the place you need
to try this out I was complaining in my
other video and English products I've
used up how I couldn't find eyeliner
that really didn't smudge and this one
is perfect and used to use me L'Oreal
hip liner I can't find it anywhere not
even on Amazon so I was so happy I found
this they claim that it's waterproof and
smudge-proof I agree with this much
proof part not really with the
waterproof I don't feel like it's really
waterproof at all I can't looking shower
and it kind of comes underneath my eyes
so I don't necessarily biggest
waterproof but it definitely stays on my
waterline a long time during the day and
it doesn't smudge or get gross on the
outer half of my eyes next I just want
to shout out my little tweezers thank my
lash tweezers I use these anytime I put
on false lashes they're the week's bye
Georgie and I got these all public as
well obviously I buy a lot of things on
the hook like but they had lashes on
there and these actually came with a set
that I got and I bought these I think I
like these a lot better than tweezers -
I don't really know why they're a lot
thicker but I just like them a little
bit better than tweezers and then
speaking of false lashes my favorite
brand of the month is these gypsy lashes
and I heard
because I watched Chloe Morelos video
and she used these as she used the ones
in number 96 and I was like I have to
look at some of those were like you
perfect wispy lashes ever and I need
them in my life I love my niece trick I
love 9:06 I think those are my two
favorite but I have a couple different
numbers and these lashes are just great
they have a really thin band and I feel
like they apply amazingly and you can
keep reusing them so they're great
quality lashes and I think they're like
2 bucks or some apiece I'll put the link
where I got them down below the last
thing I want to mention it's not really
a makeup item but it goes along with
makeup and it's these little q-tips
they're called face secrets double-ended
and they just have a pointy side and a
flatter side and I love the pointy side
for getting my wing
nice and flicked out it's amazing I know
you can get these pretty much anywhere I
got these specific ones at Sally's and I
love them I'm gonna keep your gorgeous
thing down for makeup because I think
they make your winged liner look ten
times more amazing this is like my
all-time favorite exfoliator because it
is so amazing this is the Bath and Body
Works aromatherapy stressful really and
eucalyptus spearmint and it's a sugar
scrub and this is so good it's sixteen
dollars and me and Coleman will go
through these things like crazy you
think they're perfect they exfoliate
your skin but they keep you so smooth at
the same time I just I can't get enough
this stuff if you have a chance to try
it definitely go back and buy works and
have them to do a demo on your hand
because it makes your skin so smooth so
for skincare I have been loving the Mac
cleanse off oil this is another product
into the blog post on and I hate wipe
your mascara because I think it's such a
pain in the butt to get off and I asked
in gray which is mrs. Lynn Rossy if this
was the product she was talking about
coz I remember she was mentioning this
in a video but I didn't know for sure if
it was exact one and she said yes and I
knew she said that it really took off
for waterproof mascara so
right out and she was right this is
amazing and it really does take off
everything on your eyes and you don't
have to tell apart or anything it's like
the warmth of your finger will dissolve
the makeup with this oil and it's
perfect and the next thing I have to
hair products the first one is a new
favorite hair product that is the kinder
platinum blow-dry spray I heard about
this for so long and I never purchased
it because I tried purchasing it online
from Ulta but they don't ship these or
sell them online so I had to wait so I
went into an Ulta store and I had to
remember to get it cuz half the time I
didn't remember to pick it up but I
finally remember the last time I went to
Ulta and I love this I think like
halfway through I use this every time I
get out of shower before I blow dry my
hair I spray it all over and make sure I
get it everywhere the roots the ends
everywhere and I can just tell the
difference with my hair on how shiny and
smooth it is when I blow-dry it it's
just so many thing I know it's
protecting my hair from the heat and I
love it I definitely recommend you guys
trying it out it is expensive I do have
a travel size in store
so if you don't want to buy the full
size but I think you should go ahead and
try the full size of it cuz it's so good
I'm almost done I promise and the next
thing is this kinder platinum still
getting mint this is a strong spray I
love this I got this from xoxo LC when
we did a swap last year and I love this
stuff especially on second and third day
hair when your hair is looking a little
dull and just gross you spray this
little guy I like to spray and my ends
on second and during third day hair just
because my hair gets really greasy at
the roots so I don't really want extra
shine up there but using this you know
about Midway and all the way down my
hair oh it's so good it smells amazing
too and I think this is such a great
product so definitely check it out if
you're looking for a new shine spray
okay so now I'm going to talk about the
hair I've been wearing now most
is my hair actually have two tracks in
these were curled with a smaller one so
they're really crazy right now but this
one was curled with the bigger one and I
have two other tracks in my hair now the
reason I love these is because they're
so thick and like I said I only use
three tracks at the most to get the
volume I one sometimes I'll just use two
to get extra fullness here on the side
but if I even want more hair in the back
then I'll use this one and I just love
it it looks just like regular normal
hair and it gives you so much volume and
I love it I've been loving wearing my
extensions all the time so I'm actually
going to be doing a giveaway with
Bellamy and they're gonna be four
winners so check the bottom bar down
below if you want to enter one winner
will receive 160 gram 20 inch Bellamy's
one winner will win 220 grams 22 inch
Bellamy's which is the kinds that I'm
wearing and one layer where we'll see
the Bellamy side-swept bangs and one
other winner will receive the Bellamy
Cleopatra bangs so check that out down
below if you're interested in any of
that there's different ways to enter you
guys know it is not a favorites video if
I don't mention new me because you know
I love their curling irons what I called
my hair with today the curl Jam set
thirty two millimeter wand you can get
the thirty two millimeter individually
which as most of you know this I mention
it a lot I always have coupons for them
down below you can get $115 off of the
individual ones and they're really great
I use them all the time and recently
they have launched a new straightener
now you guys know I don't straighten my
hair all the time I always usually curl
it especially in videos but in my real
day-to-day life when I'm going to work
and all the stuff at the time it's gonna
be straight or put up in a messy bun I
absolutely love love love love love this
one that I forgot the name of it so I'll
put it down here but it is amazing why
don't you ask me in my video with the BB
cream when I straighten my hair with
because it was so smooth and
tiny and looked really really healthy
and I used this one and I love it it has
the curved edge so whenever you want to
curl your hair it's a lot easier
other than nice to do it has square
edges so it's really hard to get a nice
curl so on second day hair I'll use this
as well to just curl my hair and use any
random pieces that need to be curled
I'll use this it kind of has that NARS
packaging feel it just glides through my
hair and it looks so good and still
shiny and it stays straight for a long
period of time and I can go two days
with my hair being straight after using
this because it keeps it straight for
that long it's so good but definitely I
recommend it this is a pretty expensive
one like $200 but I do of course have a
coupon code for it I think you'll get
$120 off and they were nice enough to
give that to me to give you guys so I
will definitely put that in the bottom
bar if you're looking for a new
straightener I like this a lot better
than the vintage ones that newbie sales
I think this just glides through a lot
smoother and of course the coupon code
will be in the bottom bar below and I
have another giveaway I asked a newbie
if we could do a giveaway this month
because I talk about all the time and
they agreed so we're going to be giving
away a magic wand and an argan oil and I
will put the rules for new me down below
as well I have a section for the Bellamy
giveaway in the section for the new me
giveaway and you can enter those with
you want that's pretty much it for my
favorites guys I hope you enjoyed this
