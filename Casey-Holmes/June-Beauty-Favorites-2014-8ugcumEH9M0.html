eat my June favorites and I'm so excited
to film this for you guys because I have
quite a few new products to show you and
I want to quickly say I'm sorry that
I've been gone for a little over a week
and a half and that is because in the
beginning of last week I did try to film
two videos on Monday and they both did
not turn out how I wanted them to so I
did post a picture on my Instagram of a
really pretty like blue smokey eye but
rifleman and I also tried selling a
favorites video but all of the footage
just was ranked and I didn't like it so
I figured I would wait til I get back
and not stress about it so I went to LA
in the beginning of last week and I was
working with Smashbox and the rent when
I got back from LA I got back on
Thursday my plan actually landed at 8:25
that next morning I left to go to
Tennessee to a motocross race which was
so much fun and it has been a minute
since I went to a like supercross
motocross race and I just love it I love
that environment I have so much fun when
I'm there so I just wanted to enjoy my
time and I figured once I got back I
would get on these videos for you guys
so yeah let's just go ahead and jump on
into the favorites video the first thing
I want to talk about is my hair I don't
know if you guys can really tell a lot
but in person I can tell I highlighted
the ends of my hair and I've been
looking online on some YouTube videos
about what the best highlighting kits
were and this one was the best one that
everyone recommended which is the Revlon
frost and glow color by color silk it's
a honey highlighting kit for medium to
dark brown hair you could do it the
old-school way put the cap on pull your
highlight through to get the kind of
old-school highlights but I wanted more
like biologic hair I just wanted to line
the ends to make it look a little bit
more sunkissed and it also brought a
couple pieces up here and just like
highlighted them just to kind of lighten
them up I was over my hair and I knew I
needed a haircut so I went ahead and did
the by Lodge on bracing and then I went
on my haircut today so this is what I'm
left with and I really loved it it was
so easy today just
Sibley shouldn't developer and you were
good to go and literally I had no
pattern of doing it I could do a whole
video if you guys want me to I'm gonna
plan on touching up a few pieces and
kind of bringing it up a little bit more
in the back but if you guys want me to
do a video on that I can within like the
next couple weeks I want to get my hair
and break liked this video if you want
to see how I did this look definitely
recommend this if you want to do like
the biologic thing and like I said you
guys want a video and how I did it then
just like this one and I will try to get
that down for you guys I'm gonna mention
another kind of random thing as well
this is the door misty or blooming the
bouquet oh where has this been all my
life this one is so floral and so
feminine like I cannot get enough of
this oh my god it just smells so good I
saw this on Sephora and I saw the
reviews I really really go by reviews on
Sephora and then I have 5 stars are
close to 5 stars so I'm going to order
it online and this one had really great
reviews and I read all of them they said
was really floral very feminine and I
was like well I love that kind of scent
so I'm gonna try it out this is
definitely one of my new favorites and
the bottle is just adorable so miss
Steeler blooming bouquet you need it in
your life okay also for hair I want to
mention this this is a living proof full
thickening cream body boosting volume
creating and naturally moving is what it
says on there this is actually like the
sample size you can get from Sephora
this stuff works and I am not even lying
this is supposed to make your hair feel
thicker a little bit more volume eyes
and oh my gosh I put about a quarter
size amount in my hand when my hair is
damp
rub between my hands and I literally
just do this with my hair and I kind of
just like put it all over roots to ends
and once I blow-dry my hair it's super
volume eyes I don't even have to
straighten it because my hair is already
like naturally straight it has a little
bit of wave to it but not too much this
makes it still volume eyes to the point
where I'll just put it up in like my
little poof that I've been wearing
lately you guys know I pull my bangs up
and I just kind of leave it there and
literally I don't have to use heat on my
hair for a couple days just because it's
so volumize and
the way that it looks so I highly
recommend this if you need some volume
in your life this living proof thing is
pretty amazing I kind of thought that it
was just one of those things everybody
hyped up just to hype it up because I've
heard about this for so long but never
purchased it but it does what it says
it's definitely a hight product for a
reason so I would definitely check this
out quickly three skincare products I
want to mention this is the clinic take
off the day cleansing balm you guys this
is so freakin good as you guys know I
was using the bozhe makeup break-up coal
cleansing oil for a while and I really
did love that the cleansing oil from
them is by far one of my favorites it
takes off all your makeup but I think
this one is better for your money so I
feel like I don't use as much product
because all you need a little bit of
this and it will take off everything on
your face I love the way it feels it
feels really really smooth once it's
taken off your makeup and it just kind
of feels like you're massaging your skin
it's so awesome again it is a cleansing
balm but once you like work it into your
hands it goes into like oil it just
takes off all of this makeup now this is
something I mentioned in my Mac haul and
this has been beautiful this is a Mac
prep and prime moisture infusion serum
hydrant and oh my gosh I ran out of my
day time serum so I got this to replace
that and it is amazing I'm about down to
here with it and it literally makes your
skin feel so moisturized but not greasy
though I love this I think it's been
doing great things for my skin when I
get summer in the outer portion on my
face just get super dry and putting
makeup on it it's just like a hot mess
because then it starts looking a little
bit cakey
you know clinging to the dry patches and
it just sucks so this saves my life
we're putting on makeup and literally
made everything just moisturize and
smooth so when I put my foundation on
top of my dry patches it was perfect my
skincare item is this Bobby Brown extra
eye Repair Cream and this is so good if
you can watch my channel for a while you
know that I love her other eye cream I
can't remember what it's called but it's
just her other eye cream that's like a
step down from this this one is supposed
to be like
bad-boy gold version of her eye creams
and I love this one so much
I'm not kidding when I tell you guys
this is the most moisturizing under-eye
cream I have ever used in my life it is
absolutely absolutely perfect and it's
just like a thicker cream you can use
this for daytime nighttime I've used it
for both all right two bronzers I want
to talk about that are new the first one
is this bareMinerals bronzer called the
beaches waiting this actually came in a
kit and I loved the kit it came with
this little brush this bronzer that is
absolutely humongous I also came with
this cute coral lip gloss but I haven't
played with the lip gloss yeah I've just
been using these other products so I
will find that kit and link it for you
guys below because I highly recommend it
this brush is amazing to highlight the
face it just gets right there on the top
of your cheekbone and it's just so easy
to work with it's a little bit thicker
of a fan brush and that's why I love it
but this bronzer it has just been
absolutely amazing it is a shimmery
matte bronzer so you have the matte
shade right here and then these two are
shimmery
where I have to do is I just took like
this little kabuki brush from Mac and
just kind of dusted it on all the shades
and I applied it to the tops of my
forehead just to kind of bronze and also
contour the forehead to make it look a
little bit smaller and then I will drive
it on the cheekbones and then down my
neck honestly you guys this is just the
most beautiful bronzer ever things look
great on almost everybody if you're
super super fair it might be a little
too much but if you like a light to
medium skin tone up to I would say a
good tan you would like this a lot I
think it's just beautiful to bronze the
face with and it might be shimmery but
it doesn't come off like super shimmery
on your face so so pretty
the next bronzer I'm going to talk about
is one that I got when I went to is
Amanda this is the Estee Lauder bronze
goddess bronzer just a soft matte
bronzer I'm guessing it's called bronze
goddess I have no idea this is a huge
bronzer as you can see this is the last
quite a while I do have this as my
contour today and you open it up and it
comes with this brush right here which I
haven't played with but it seems like
right quality so I like don't want to
throw it away but this is the bronzer
right here this one does have more of a
red undertone its prominent coming off
on camera so a hand warmer right
undertone which is really nice it's a
little bit more natural and even though
it says Mac there is a little bit of
shimmer in here but when you put it on
your face like you don't see it at all
so don't be scared by the shimmer in the
bronzer because literally I have as my
contour and you couldn't even tell that
there's shimmer in it whatsoever okay so
speaking of Estee Lauder I have to shout
out my Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation this has been a lifesaver for
me this month now I went back to this
because I was using my L'Oreal too much
a lot for like a month and a half two
months straight and I wanted to switch
it up
so I decided to use this I actually
don't have it on today I have this
Chanel foundation on I'll leave the name
of it down below but I wanted to use
this again because I remember and I used
to love it when I was visiting Amanda we
would go out at night I would put this
foundation on at around 7 o'clock at
night literally I would forget to wash
my face because stuff happens sometimes
you can't always wash your face
I wouldn't wash my face in the next
morning Amanda was like what foundation
do you have on because it looks really
good and I was like Estee Lauder Double
Wear I love this foundation Rick you
have rosacea or anything you want to
cover up this is amazing because it will
cover anything you wanted to cover on
your face I remember in my review I did
say that I didn't like to apply this in
my Beauty Blender this was back in like
November December or something like that
I said I didn't like to use this my
Beauty Blender that's actually the way I
prefer it now because I can use a light
amount because the Beauty Blender just
sets it on the skin really nicely it
makes it look flawless so this where the
Beauty Blender has been my absolute
favorite I've been wearing my golden
smokey eye tutorial so much this month I
will leave the tutorial down below for
you guys but I used the colors tempting
Carbon Brown script this highlight shade
shroom I have been using those shades
all the time every
or something if I just want something so
treat in smokier that look is what I
will go to so I will leave that soil
down below for you guys I just I
couldn't get enough of it I had to keep
using it people were commenting on my
Instagram like these looks look the same
I'm like because it's the same I just
can't stop wearing this eyeshadow so
love that look that I did again I
believe it down below for you guys
once you quickly mention a highlighter I
have been really loving this is a bobbi
brown shimmer break in beige heard about
this from my girl Amanda as well we go
shopping together a lot we talk a lot we
talk every day so we're always talking
about new products and things we want to
try out and she recommended this on her
channel and I was like alright I'm going
to try it because this girl's obsessed
with shimmer break I know she knows her
highlighters so this is just the most
beautiful highlighter ever do you see
how it just shines it's just like a
gorgeous neutral highlighter I love it
so so so much I've been starting to get
into these shimmer brick highlighters
because I was a little nervous because
these shades are a little bit darker so
I was like it's probably gonna be a
darker highlighter I don't want to try
that out but since I got this one I've
been purchasing a couple more and I've
just been loving them but beige has been
one of my favorites so I had to mention
it in this video we are almost done next
up is just the lip combo I've been
wearing and it is actually on my lips
right now so the first new item is this
Mac lip pencil in whirl this is so good
I mentioned this to you guys in my Mac
called said that this is the color
College inner wears so this is just a
nice and Molly nude very very very
pretty I love it it's very creamy as
well so I've been loving that lip liner
with this Too Faced melted long wear
lipstick this one's in the color melted
nude now when I first watched this on my
hand at a Sephora I was like that is way
way way too dark for me I'm not gonna
love it and then I kept hearing people
rave about it and I was like oh just
gonna go purchase it and see how I like
it and literally you guys I love this
the color is perfect on my lips
I don't know why I thought it was too
dark especially since I'm
more of the darker news I don't know why
I thought this almost too dark because
this is like the perfect shade and it
really does last a long time on your
lips I have heard some people say that
it's moisturizing I don't think it's
moisturizing I think it can be a little
drying so I always top it with a lip
gloss and I do like to put like maybe a
chopstick or something underneath
because it is a long wear lipstick so I
mean I kind of expect it to be drying
because it is a long wear lipstick so
it's gonna want to stay on your lips
longer the packaging is super cute I
mean you can't really beat this I kind
of want to try the other shades so if
you guys have tried to other shades of
these let me know if you like them so
the lip gloss I've been topping over
that I actually got this from me Mac
alerting aquatic collection and this is
in the color peach stalk I also
purchased the lipstick and peach talk
and I just love it this is a perfect
peachy nude lip gloss and I'm just
obsessed with it oh all three of these
on my hand don't look like they'll go
together very well but I love the combo
I think it looks great and it's just
like a nice darker nude I know I always
talk about nudes I love my nude
lipsticks so I feel like I'm always
trying to find different combos to show
you guys okay guys so that is it for
this video I really hope you enjoyed it

always interested in trying out new
