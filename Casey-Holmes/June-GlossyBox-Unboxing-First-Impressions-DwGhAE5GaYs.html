a glossy box unboxing and first
impressions now I know glossy box is
kind of huge when it first came out they
contacted a bunch of girls to kind of
show everybody it wasn't really what was
gonna be in it but was kind of just like
an example of what's going on but I
personally decided to order a classy box
now they are $21 a month what is this I
guess you would call this the dilla July
glossy box with the June I don't know we
had to figure it out but um I'm gonna go
ahead and open it for you guys I haven't
even opened the top part yet so it's
just like a tear off little thing which
is pretty convenient my Mel lady like
stuffed this in my mailbox sounds like
woman okay so I opened the box and this
is what the top looks like has um okay
they're calling us to July 2012 alright
so that was answered and it just has
some cool things I'm not gonna go
through this because I know when I watch
subscription things and they go through
the little cards of everything in it I'm
like oh get to the point so this is a
box it's a nice sturdy box I know you
guys have seen it it has the cute
detailing and then this is the top and
this box is called summer simplicity's
so woohoo who doesn't love anything
summer themed I love everything summer
themed okay so just going to untie the
flow this is really cute um something
alright let's fish the card alright so
the first thing is this perfume Organic
so it's an organic perfume um right
right no it's not what is this okay this
is called urban organic it's a sweet
lemon sorbet with bourbon
tangy lemon peel blah blah blah let's
just smell it let's not even worry about
this it's really tiny sample
uh-huh I would never wear that ever ever
ever ever so again I did get the urban
organic one please excuse my nails I
would never purchase this ever I don't
like the self sorry all right
and we also have a a hava a hava I don't
know what is this
a velvet cream wash it's a body wash
with healthy dead sea minerals it's a
pretty good size this is three fluid
ounces that's good alright that I can
work with that smells good
it says hibiscus and fig I love the
smell of hibiscus holy cannoli I love
that smell so yeah I'm definitely gonna
be trying that out see how I like it
that's a really really good size next is
this Wella Professionals and rich
moisturizing treatment for fine to
normal hair okay mines like open to kind
of that's not cool but I guess it's just
a little treatment for your hair it
smells really good and it's a good sized
sample 0.8 for fluid ounces it will give
you enough to kind of decide whether you
like it or not this is the smooth shave
cream daily essentials um for a smooth
shave hey this is what it looks like
let's smell this
even though probably half ya'll don't
care what shaving cream smells like and
it's not coming off alright oh hello
no it's like anything we'll see I'll try
it out and this is a good size as well
two fluid ounces alright now we have
this weird color it's an eye shadow from
ice Goldilocks way note maybe it's
called ice I don't know but it's from
Oprah Oprah it's kind of a gold shadow I
guess with you it this is a cream shadow
um I've never seen an eye shadow that
it's like a lip gloss kind of thing just
I hope this is an eye shadow because I
would never wear this on my lips
I'm not a fan honestly that's the color
of it I don't really like this color
I'll never wear it um so that's neat and
then on the bottom there's just this
skincare stuff which I do love skincare
from vbeaute and it just has a
nourishing repair eye cream and everyday
cream and an intense brightening agent
which that's really cool and these are
actually pretty nice sized samples so
these will be great to kind of try all
in all so they're paraben free fragrance
free gluten-free nut-free oat free
dermatologist tested not tested on
animals so that's really good
I mean I like certain things about it on
the eyeshadow I probably won't wear I'm
excited to try this and definitely this
shaving or not the body wash and this
and skincare stuff so oh no I didn't
like two things out of it so but this
month you got one two three four five
six little samples so otherwise I like
it um uh let me see do I think it's
worth twenty dollars I don't know if I
feel like it's worth the $20 I'm not
gonna lie I will stay subscribed I think
they just took out my next payment for
my next box so I'll stay subscribed and
see you I have in my next box and kind
of see if it gets any better if not I
might unsubscribe we'll just have to see
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
little glossy box unboxing and review
unlike this video if you're into seeing
more unboxings and first impressions and
stuff like that and I will see you all
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
