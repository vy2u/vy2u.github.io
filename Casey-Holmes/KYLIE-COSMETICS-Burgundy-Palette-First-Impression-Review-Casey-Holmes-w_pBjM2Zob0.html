I bake
hey guys welcome back to my channel
today I'm going to be showing you a
little tutorial on this look it's really
easy and I'm also going to give you like
my first impressions review on the new
Kylie cosmetics a burgundy palette I was
super excited to go online and get this
because these are my kind of colors like
stop it this is what they look like
they're absolutely stunning they're warm
they're gorgeous I just I knew just from
looking at them at least had to try them
out I did see a lot of reviews on her
first palette which were kind of like
mmm everybody had different opinion
about the palette but I haven't seen too
many reviews on this one just because I
wanted to buy it and I wanted to kind of
get my own opinion first before I like
watched anyone's videos again like I
said this is the only palette that I
purchased from her love that she did the
teardrops to kind of match the palette I
think that's really creative and it has
a nice little touch to it
I also love the eyes this packaging is
really nice okay it is cardboard but
it's not like flimsy cardboard it is
really nice this one does not have a
mirror it does just say Kylie but one
thing that I did figure out while
filming this and like playing with it
tossing it around being so excited is
these actually pop out and they're
magnetic so if you wanted to take all of
these out and put them into a magnetic
palette with a mirror you totally could
personally for me I don't really mind
that there's not a mirror in here I mean
it's nice to have a mirror in the
palette but if it doesn't have it and
the eyeshadows are good I really don't
mind because usually I'll have another
mirror somewhere else you know I'm
saying
so this eyeshadow palette was $42 and I
also did get a lip kit I really wanted
to try this one out this one's in the
shade pumpkin and I'm going to talk
about this lip kit in just a few moments
after the eye shadow palette so it is
$42 but you get nine shadows if you kind
of do the math on that it's about four
or five dollars a piece just really not
a bad deal I did see it with her last
palette that there was a lot of issues
with like the formula of the shimmery
eyeshadows I don't really remember the
mattes remember seeing that the shimmery
eyeshadows were the ones that people are
complaining about the most so when I got
this palette was kind of nervous I
didn't know what to really expect but I
really liked it I think this is a really
great pot I'm just going to go ahead and
say it I did pay for this myself just
going to go ahead and
you that this palette is definitely
worth the money I think it is so much
fun if you love warm colors like this
you would love this palette it is just
so beautiful the one thing it is missing
for me personally we all know we all
know that I get a little specific when
it comes to palette but for me the only
two things I wish we're in here or a
black and a vanilla shake but it's
totally fine because they do have this
deep brown in here which I love for this
palette and the reason why I like to
have like a vanilla shade and a palette
is to set my primer so that when I go in
with these shadows it doesn't stick and
doesn't not not blend as well
so that's why then it kind of sucks but
you can always take your face powder or
vanilla eyeshadow and just set your eye
so that's what I did today I used one of
my Natasha de Nonna
I showed us and I just set the lid and I
was good to go the mattes in this
eyeshadow palette blend so well you guys
they blame so well and they look so
beautiful I don't know she like amped up
the formula of these but they are
absolutely phenomenal I just I love them
I think they are so stunning so here are
a few the matte shades this one is when
my favorites I absolutely love this
color in a matte shade and then you also
have this orange right here you guys
know I just love these colors I'll show
you right here that's barely me doing
anything like I said these blend really
really well and now going into the
shimmer shades this one is the one that
I have on in the inner corner of my lid
and I really like it again it's so
pigmented look at that I mean holy crap
it's beautiful so with this one I did
apply with a brush and then with my
fingers the fingers did put a little bit
more product onto the lid but I liked
using my brush as well it was just
convenient for me I didn't mess with
this shade or this shade today these
were the only two I didn't really mess
with very much I did use this one as my
highlight underneath my brow it's not a
super light highlight but I do like it I
think if you're a little bit more fair
you're not really gonna like it as a
brow bone highlight because it's gonna
be a little bit too dark but I think if
you're medium to deep skin tones I think
you're I don't know it's like you off
but I think you're really going to enjoy
the Shay to highlight it's a little bit
different it is a little bit different
it's kind of like a topi type of
champagne highlight
if that makes any sense it's different
but it worked I mean if you could see my
brow bone that's all I have underneath
oh yeah fixed brow hair all I have
underneath my brow bone and that's
what's poppin and shinin and looking
good I like this a lot if I get a little
more fair I probably won't be able to
wear it as much but for now I do like it
this would also be great like in the
inner part of the eye I do want to dip
my finger into this one because it just
looks so beautiful
kind of right off the bat is not as
intense my opinion with these two this
one right here this gold color right
here is definitely more intense than
this one but this still is very very
pretty
I feel like this shade has a little bit
more shimmer to it and really pops that
out you more I just really like this
palette I had so much fun using it today
it really made me excited and these are
the kind of looks that I love something
like a sunset very blown out I don't
need a winged liner I love colors like
this one to really go low on my lower
lashline and smoke it out just so it
pops really nicely and then I want to
quickly move on to the Kylie lip kit and
pumpkin
so I have not purchased a lip kit in a
while last time I had my lip kits were
back when I did my first Kylie cosmetics
video and I did really like them then
they are a little bit drying and some of
them were patchy in that video you can
go check it out I'll link it down below
this one I actually have right now mixed
with candy Kay but I put pumpkin on
first this formula feels different it
feels a lot more moisturizing and it's
not as drying as the older formulas I
know she's learning as she goes and like
switching things up trying to make it
better and I feel like she's making in
this formula a lot better this feels
really good on the lips it feels
completely different than the other ones
that I have purchased from her this one
feels like the Smashbox liquid lipsticks
and you guys know I love those so this
is pumpkin right here I did buy the one
with a lip liner because I really love
this color I think it's absolutely
stunning the reason why I mixed it with
candy K is because I kind of wanted to
tone it down because it didn't really go
with the look so I didn't mix it with
candy K but that's what it looks like
right there and when it dries it's just
a gorgeous warm orange like a really
deep brown orange and I love it it's so
different I don't have anything like
this in my collection I think it is
stunning
it was really easy to apply again and
like I said it is so comfortable on the
lips I haven't really been keeping up
with the updates of her cosmetic line so
I don't know she's really amped up the
formula but to me it feels like she has
and I really like this if this is her
new formula I want to order it more
shades so this is probably a super quick
video I just want to pop on here show
you guys a little tutorial and talk to
you about this palette because I was
really excited to get it in I did
purchase it not sponsored by anyone you
guys know I'm honest with my reviews I'm
not gonna tell you I like something if I
don't like it because if I spend my
hard-earned money on it and I don't like
it I don't want you to spend your
hard-earned money on it and you not like
it so I mean just because don't work for
me don't leave it's not gonna work for
you but you know what I'm saying
you know I'm try and look out for you
let you know what I think so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and if you want
to see the little tutorial that I did
then let's just go ahead and get started
okay so the first shade we're going to
take is Beach and we're just going to
put this into the crease and bus it all
out just make sure it's nice and blended
because this is going to be our
transition shade
next we're gonna take penny which is a
really nice orange toned eyeshadow and
we're going to put this a little bit
below the beach shade that we just put
on this is just going to help deep it up
a little bit and give it a little more
dimension and as you can see these eye
shadows are blending out so well they
were just so easy to work with
now I'm taking Burgundy my favorite
shade in the palette it is absolutely
stunning and this went on the lid so
well you guys I love these kinds of
colors this really makes brown eyes pop
green eyes will pop blue eyes will pop
it will just look gorgeous on everyone
then I'm taking the shade I think it's
Dubai yeah taking this show you Dubai
I'm going to put this on the inner part
of the eye this is that gold toned
eyeshadow very very beautiful by the way
Kylie does have the names on the back of
the eyeshadow palette so if you're
wondering I am reading them off of the
back
I'm going to go back in with burgundy
with a more dense brush and I'm just
going to put this back in that outer V
and make sure it really pops this look
is so easy to do once I put my lashes on
and everything I just use a burgundy
eyeliner on my waterline and then I
really smoked out that burgundy on the
lower lash line as well I didn't show it
but I just really smoked it out and it
also took Dubai in the inner part of the
eye and connected it with the burgundy
on the outer half of my bottom lash line
as you can see it's just really popping
because I dragged it down pretty low so
that is the eye very very very simple
and then the lip is the pumpkin lip
liner and then the pumpkin liquid
lipstick and you'll see here at the end
I did like the way it looked I just
don't like the lip color and this eye
look together it just didn't sink well
for me so that's why I did put candy
Kate on top but it is a really beautiful
matte orange and I absolutely love it so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you all in my next video bye
