first impression on this foundation it's
the Kat Von D lock-it
tattoo foundation and a lot of you have
been requesting this so I figured I
would go ahead and get this up for you
guys and it is FIF if you don't know
what that means its first impression
Friday I used to do these a lot last
year and I kind of quit doing them so I
brought them back and I'm going to start
doing them every other Friday anyways
this is going to be a collab with what
would Lizzie do and she actually has
already tried this foundation out but
she's gonna do a review on her channel
so if you're new to my channel I have
very very oily skin and she has oily
combo skin so if you want to check out
her review on this foundation I will
link it down below I love her channel
she's so funny so I definitely recommend
you guys checking her out and I will
leave everything down below for her
channel I said this is the Kat Von D
Lockett tattoo foundation I am very
excited to try this bad boy out I got
the color medium 54 I'm hoping this will
be the shape for me it's looking pretty
close in the bottle it's my skin if
you're new to my channel as well
I don't self tan my face so that's why
my face is a lot lighter than my body
and uh as you can see I'm breaking out
lately I don't know what the problem is
this is what the packaging looks like I
just took the little thingy off and it
is a pump which is great the packaging
is like to die for so let's just go
ahead and get started I'm going to use
my Beauty Blender today because I use it
for literally everything and if you want
to be where my sweat shirts from I'll
leave it down below in the description
box okay so I'm going to just do a
couple pumps on the back of my hand so
very it's probably too much but it's a
very thick foundation it's not really
runny it's going very slow like a slug
but let's just see how this works
oh yeah it's thick whoa Lord that was
way too much to throw in my hand oh look
at that
oh okay so we're just gonna dot this I
don't know how fast this dries it's not
enough I should work it in quickly dang
you see that Wow
oh yeah I put too much on the back of my
hand because a little bit of this stuff
goes a very long way this is a thicker
foundation you can feel it kind of
sticking to the Beautyblender a little
bit to blend it in but you saw how quick
it was just to get my whole face covered
like I put way too much on that my hand
way too much like I probably need this
much just for my forehead so you can see
from my forehead and my actual face
because my face is pretty much just like
my forehead how it has redness and stuff
like that um it covered it up crazy good
I feel like I put too much on but we'll
just have to go with it cuz that little
dot just covered out my whole forehead
perfectly yeah I used way too much on my
face face think I might take it off and
go back in because I used way too much
yeah I think I'm going to go I'm going
to take this off real quick on the
bottom half of my face and redo it
because I put way too much on you could
tell I have what a great first
impression person I am right oh by the
way I did prime my face on my benefit
Porefessional and my Mac primer
these two babies I use all the time so
quickly quickly quickly I'm going to put
this back on I'm just going to do the
Porefessional because supposedly Kat Von
D's must be really good this one it's
supposed to be really good at keeping
you Matt because it says it's full
coverage 24-hour wear transfer resistant
that's a big deal
oil free fragrance free and I mean it
might be oh no it's not like foundation
to me so yeah a little bit not as much
as I had Oh such a difference Wow
and let me tell you it's hard for me to
get foundation nice and covered on my my
nose to get nice and covered with
foundation this just went right on okay
so you can see the difference from this
side of my face in this side of my face
I really like it so far I do think it
kind of situates my pores and not gonna
lie I can see my pores that maybe with
powder and stuff it won't look too crazy
you guys probably can't tell on the
camera but it's literally like a perfect
match to my neck
perfecto okay so let me wipe this off
rig it on my sweatshirt so that's what
the foundation looks like on it looks
really good I'm liking it so far um like
I said when I had to redo it a little
bit does go a very long way so just take
a little bit at a time and put it on
your skin and it gives you it literally
is full coverage I can't wait to try
this out with my Sigma f80 I'll update
you guys when I do it FIF update decided
to include my FIF updates in my current
my monthly favorites videos so that way
you can I don't have to do a separate
video for just two products you know
what I mean um so in my monthly
favorites just keep an eye out I'll try
this out with the f80 foundation brush
and I'll let you guys know what I think
of it but I always use the Beauty
Blender so that's why I used it today
and so far I really do like it um I can
just see my pores which I'm not really a
big fan of but it looks very flawless
maybe after I put powder on the pores
will kind of go down or something but
yeah so far like its I'm going to do the
rest of my face makeup and I will be
right back to give you another update
okay so I've got the rest of my face
makeup on and if you want to check out
this look I did do a tutorial and I
uploaded it last Saturday so I will
leave that down below if you're
interested it's like my go-to oh sorry
it's like my go-to fall makeup look so
definitely check that out below if
you're interested in seeing how I got
this look it's really simple and it's
just that's why it's my go-to as you can
see you can't kind of see my little acne
spot right here that's coming in which I
didn't put extra concealer on it because
I was like it's really not a big deal to
me um but I mean for the most part I did
cover up everything I feel like if I
would have put just like a tiny bit of
foundation over top it would kind of
camouflage - even more but I didn't feel
like doing it I was like I even wore
about it I washed my face it is a matte
finish I meant to mention that after I
put the foundation on but I forgot it is
very matte and I did set it with powder
obviously because I set everything with
powder and yeah so far I do like it my
blush and bronzer went on really great
and I'm really happy with it so far
and one other thing it does say on here
transfer-resistant but I actually
changed into a white sweatshirt and it
went on the white sweatshirt so I don't
agree with the transfer-resistant part
of this but I agree with the matte
finish
part of it so we'll see it's supposed to
last for a really long time says 24
hours I'm not going to sit here and do
this for 24 hours is now 304 if you can
see my little Daisy back there she's
cute right
so it's 304 and I will update you guys
in a little bit on how the foundation is
way hi guys
so I'm back for an update it is now 851
and I did blot with this foundation I
actually put on the Urban Decay D slick
mattifying powder which this is just
like a translucent powder so it's not
going to add any extra coverage it's
just going to mattify you I did feel
like I get it a little bit shiny
throughout the day while wearing this
foundation which you know honestly I'm
so early I'm not even surprised but if I
wasn't like excessive it was just
shininess that I didn't want to my face
cuz I like a completely matte face which
some people might not like but that's
that's just how I like my face to look I
love the matte looks and they do have
very oily skin but honestly overall I do
still really love the foundation the
only thing I will say is it definitely
looks like you're wearing foundation
it's not like one of those kind of
products that you could put on and be
like oh your skin so beautiful today
have you changed your skincare like no
it's like yeah you're wearing a full
coverage truck I totally totally think
that may be the biggest mistake some
people might make with this foundation
is like what I did earlier and apply a
really heavy coverage like that like I
did on the first half of my face but
when I went back in with us
our lair it still gives you amazing
coverage so you don't need a lot this
foundation at all like having a metaphor
I'd say three hours and then I had to
blot but yeah I do still really like it
so far blush and bronzer still going
strong I think the coverage is just
fan-freaking-tastic it is now 853 and
I'll come back in just a few hours and
finish up this video for you guys hi
guys so it is now the end of the night
is actually 12:20 you can see that right
there and I'm just going to give you a
little rundown on the foundation first
off I want to say I do like the
foundation a lot it holds up really well
it doesn't get sloppy throughout the day
which I love and it started off as a
matte finish
I have very oily skin so I did get shiny
throughout the day which is why I did
read powder with a translucent powder I
can't wait to try this with my Sigma f80
brush and I want to see how it applies
with that brush as well so the run
through all the claims it has for the
full coverage part it is very full
coverage 24-hour wear I wouldn't be
surprised if it was 24-hour wear because
I've worked for a while and it hasn't
broken up the whole longevity of it is
pretty amazing transfer resistant I
think it does transfer I don't think is
transfer resistant and digging on my
white sweater earlier matte finish it is
matte right when you put it on for about
three hours on me at least and then I do
get a little shiny but it's not like
excessively oily and gross so I love
that about the foundation it still kind
of keeps a little bit of your oils at
bay and you do get I should have
mentioned this in the beginning you get
one fluid ounce which is you know the
normal amount that you usually get in
the foundation so I hope you guys
