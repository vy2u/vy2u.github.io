wanna say I've been wearing my hair a
lot like this lately I love it but I
need a haircut like this side is so long
just like this side and I really need a
haircut and I like the fact that I have
some of it back and yeah I don't know
I'll be having a new hairstyle very soon
yeah okay so this video is all about the
Kat Von D lock attaching foundation now
if you guys oh my god you can see Daisy
over here let's give you a sneak people
what she's doing she's laying with her
legs out she's so ladies like I can't
even so if you guys have not seen it I
did do a first impression on this
foundation and I will link it down below
and I did mention this in my favorites
video which is probably gonna be up
after this one and I had to say I love
this but I definitely wanted to do a
separate video because I still wanted to
say some things about it and let you
know my tips and what I think about it
for very oily skin first off this is a
very full coverage foundation and I was
told later on in the month of November
that I do have rosacea so if you have
rosacea this will cover up that redness
really really well I have a lot of
redness here in my cheeks and it's
covered up very nicely with this
foundation the only thing about this
foundation is that it can be so freakin
thick and cakey it can be just it could
be just too much sometimes if you do not
blend this foundation in it is going to
look major
cake face and disgusting it took me like
a couple times to see which ways I like
to apply it but I'm going to show you
some brushes and let you know what I
like to do with it
now this foundation I'm in the color
medium 54 first off I love the pump it
has not broken me out at all I know some
people have had that problem but the one
thing I will say if you have a very oily
skin like I do you will definitely have
to blot and powder with this thing I
probably about four hours I will become
so shiny it is ridiculous and it looks
disgusting like I'll be disgustingly
shiny where I have better hurry up and
block my face red powder and honestly
whenever I blot in powder it's okay like
if the foundation doesn't rub off or
anything just that excess
that I have on my skin needs to be off
otherwise it's just gonna look like a
slick nasty gross oily face I don't know
it's just disgusting
if you have oily skin just be prepared
put them blotting sheets in your purse
because my oil just seeped through and
it was disgusting and it's really gross
after a few hours but as long as I keep
track of how my skin is looking
it'll be fine and I'll look okay
throughout the night and like I said
that when you bought the foundation does
not come off this does last for a very
long time even with blotting so I love
that I don't believe it's transfer
resistant I've mentioned that before by
the way all these brushes are dirty
because like I would use a brush and you
can only use it about two times and then
you have to wash it before using it with
this foundation again because it's so
thick that these bristles will stick
together you can't really blend it out
nicely so I just kept using different
brushes and I figured out different
brushes that I like to use with it so
first one is Sigma f80 this is by far my
favorite it covers a really nice area
because it's so big and this has been
hyped up on YouTube for a long time but
for good reason it is awesome it just
makes the foundation go onto the skin
beautifully and I love it it's a good
brush next one is this Real Techniques
buffing brush I recently discovered this
one for the foundation and I love it it
blends the foundation and amazingly as
well actually all these brushes do so
I'm just going to kind of take you
through what they what the names are but
I highly recommend this one it is
awesome again it is the Real Techniques
buffing brush and then I'll use these
two stippling brushes this one's from
Real Techniques as well and this one's
from Mac it's the 130 the real technique
one is just a lot bigger than the Mac
one but I love both of them I think they
work very very well for blotting I like
to use the Maybelline Dream matte powder
that is by far my favorite powder to
blot with of course you wouldn't take a
look at issue or blotting paper and get
that oil off of your skin or else you're
just gonna put powder on top and it's
going to get even worse throughout the
day so take that blotting-paper block
off that excess oil and then you can
read powder if you feel the need to I
always read powder because I'm an old
mess so the one I like to use is like I
said Maybelline Dream matte powder or
this Mac prep and prime transparent
finishing powder this isn't
also one to keep like almond go and I
love it I mean it's transparent you
can't go wrong and the mainland dream at
one is like it's so silky you won't even
tell you have that powder on your skin
so all now I just wanted to give you
guys a quick update I love the
foundation but man do I get oily
throughout the night if I don't blow out
my skin if the longevity of it is
amazing it has amazing coverage it's
definitely one of my favorites I just
have to be cautious of what my skin's
looking like for after about four hours
or so so this is about thirty-six
dollars I hope you guys enjoyed the FIF
I did on it and also this update I
figured I would give you an update and
kind of give you some tips and let you
know the brushes that I really liked to
use with it so yeah I hope you guys
enjoy this video thank you so much for
watching and I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
