a a makeup look inspired by Kim
Kardashian and it was actually on
Pinterest the other day and I saw this
photo of her so I'm really excited to
show you guys how I got this look I
think it's a beautiful way to wear green
eyeshadow she looked absolutely stunning
and flawless and just not harsh at all
she didn't have a super strong contour
or highlight it was just very soft
feminine and pretty and a pop of color
you could also switch off the green with
maybe a purple a blue
anything you wanted to do if you end up
recreating this look and then hashtag me
at kcal 91 so I can check it out on all
my social media sites linked down below
in the description box also I'm really
guys know my skin is breaking out so by
August so bad like I can't even deal
with it I used a different mask the
other night and my skin has been
freaking out ever since so I'm really
sorry about all the breakouts I'm having
right now it's just it's this struggle
and you know I got to keep it real I
wanted to feel the tutorial for you guys
so we just had to keep going we had to
keep going on with the show so if you
guys have any other celebrity of makeup
looks you want me to recreate then send
me some pictures on Twitter Instagram
anything you want or you could just let
me know in the comments below what
celebrity you would like to is see you
next and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel so you don't miss out on any
videos and let's just go ahead and get
on to the tutorial
okay so the first thing we're going to
do is apply tape to the outer corners of
our eye and this is just going to give
us a nice sharp edge and we can be as
messy as we want to be so first taking
the lorac pro 2 palette I'm gonna take
the bottom shimmer shades which I think
was snow in beige I'll leave them in the
description box below but I'm gonna
place this all over the lid it looked
like Kim had a really light green all
over her lid but I personally didn't
have that color or at least one that I
really wanted to use so I decided to mix
these colors together and use them and
when we take in the 120 palette from BH
Cosmetics and that green right there and
I will just be putting this into the
crease and this will kind of be our
transition shade so you don't want it to
be too dark of a green just a nice light
medium green and you just want to take
this color all the way from the outer
corner of your eye all the way to the
inner corner
then I'm taking this darker green and
the palette I'm going to be using a
pencil brush I did use this one but I
ended up switching because I needed a
brush that's more dense so I'm taking a
pencil brush and putting this directly
into the crease and I'm also going to
drag a little bit in towards the inner
corner of my eye but I really want to
focus this on the outer half of the eye
doing more of a cut crease kind of look
and then I'm taking this palette from BH
Cosmetics because I liked this green a
lot better it was a lot darker and I
just liked the tone so much better so
I'm gonna go back over where we placed
that second green shade and then what
I'm gonna do is I'm just going to blend
this so it's not super super harsh you
could tell in the photo she has a little
bit of a darker green on the outer half
of the eye to add just a little bit more
definition
then I'm gonna take soft brown for Mac
and I'm gonna place this right above
where we put our first green shade just
so everything flows to the brow bone
really nicely and we don't have any
crazy lines or anything like that and
then I'm just gonna take my blending
brush again and go back over these
shadows just to make sure there are no
harsh lines then you can go ahead and
take off the tape and you can see a
really nice sharp line and I'm going to
be taking the NARS eyeliner and lining
my upper waterline and then taking the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner I will
be doing a winged out eyeliner as well
it looks like Kim had the winged out
eyeliner in her photo
it wasn't anything too dramatic it was
just a nice clean eyeliner look with a
little bit of a wing
then I'm gonna take this concealer
palette and just clean up the outer
edges and make sure it's nice and sharp
I also did apply false lashes I applied
to followers girl you crazy and I will
leave them down below went ahead and
applied primers and then for the
foundation i'll be using Estee Lauder
Double Wear in four in one and if you
guys are interested in any other
products or colors that I'm using in
this video I will like I said have
everything listed in the description box
below for you to go ahead and check out
so taking that mac prolongwear concealer
I'm gonna place that underneath my eyes
and the center of the face just to
highlight and I'm gonna take my beauty
blender and blend all of that out then
taking in the NARS concealer which I
love to use for my nose I'm going to
place this in the center of my nose just
to help highlight and contour that since
it is a little bit bigger or a lot
bigger whatever you prefer taking the UH
Nastasia contour kit and the banana
shade if there's any shade I feel like I
can recommend from anastacio it's
definitely this banana powder because
it's just perfect and I use it all the
time so I highly recommend it and I just
placed that banana shade all over the
concealer wherever I place concealer I
put that color and then for the rest of
the face I took a duo fiber brush and
put my translucent powder and set
everything in place taking this bronzer
from Laura Mercier it's in the color
bronze zero two I'm just going to bronze
the face and kind of help it match my
body a little bit more since my
foundations looking a little light and
in the picture of Kim she had really
nice bronzed skin nothing too much but
you could tell she had a nice bronzer on
and then she might not have had a super
strong contour but I think she still did
a little something so I did take the
benefit hoola bronzer and just lightly
had a slight contour just to help shape
the face a little bit more and I also
put some underneath my lip and also
contoured my nose
taking Melba from Mac Kim had a really
pretty just natural looking flush to her
cheeks and I figured Mel Belt would be
the perfect shape for this and I just
adore it so I'm gonna apply that to the
cheekbones and then blend it out with a
duo fiber just so it's nice and soft
then I'm going to be taking a
highlighter I don't know if she used
anything too intense from the photo I
couldn't tell so I just used this one
it's not anything too crazy but I could
tell on her lip she had a very nice
highlight so I made sure I put some on
my Cupid's bow I went ahead and did my
brows I will leave the brow product I
use down below and then for the
waterline I'm using a nude liner from
Rimmel this will just really help open
up the eyes and it kind of goes along
with your lid as well and then I'm going
to taking the darker green shade that we
used in the crease and I'm going to be
placing this right underneath my lashes
and right there in that lash line so I'm
gonna be pressing it with this brush I
think this one's from Mac but Sigma does
have one called the e15 which is the
flat definer and it works just as well
and then I'll take a pencil brush and
just blend that out so it's nice and
soft and it doesn't look super harsh
underneath there
you see how it all just flows the nude
flows with the lid the green on the
lower lash line goes with the crease I
just love it and then I'm going to be
applying a mascara to my bottom lashes
and for lips her lips were very very
natural in this photo so I'm just lining
mine with stripped down from Mac this is
just gonna help my lips look a little
bit bigger and then for a color she had
a really pretty natural shade on I don't
know if it was her lip color or what but
it was just something very glossy and
pretty so I'm taking this sexy mother
pucker lip pencil I guess from soap &amp;amp;
Glory and I'm placing this all over my
lips just for a nice flush of color and
then taking this whitening lightening
color smile gloss and coral I'm going to
top it over that and then you are good
to go I really hope you guys enjoyed
