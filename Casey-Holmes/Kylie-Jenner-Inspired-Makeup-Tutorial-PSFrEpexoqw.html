a Kylie Jenner inspired makeup look I
follow her on Instagram and she
literally wears a red lip and just a
nude eye all the time with winged
eyeliner and I absolutely loved it so I
figured I would do a tutorial for you
guys and let's just go ahead and get
started first thing already moisturize
my lips with this Nivea lip butter I
love this stuff and then I'm going in
with my makeup forever matte velvet plus
with my Beauty Blender because Kylie
always has an amazingly flawless face so
this is gonna help us achieve that look
okay next I'm going in with my prep and
prime highlighter from Mac this is in
radiant rose and I'm going to be
applying this all underneath my under
eye area and I'm just going to take it
back to my temples as well it's just
gonna really highlight underneath there
and brighten it up then I'm going to
take my favorite brush this is the f-86
from Sigma I use it literally all the
time and I'm gonna just blend out this
radiant rose underneath my eyes and this
brush just really helps get a nice
airbrushed finish to the under eye area
it's really amazing and I can't
recommend it enough
and also to top that I'm going to take
the same brush with my mac prolongwear
concealer and and c20 and I'm just going
to top this over it just to make it look
skin tone colored I don't know the
radiant Rose really does lighten
underneath there so I want to put a nice
skin tone color on top
been taking the same brush again and
with this makeup forever super matte
loose powder talked about all the time
just going to set my under eye area and
my face
and I also forgot to get a clip of this
but I did go ahead and pry my eyes with
my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre this is a
great primer for your eyes especially
for this look because it really just
makes your eyes get a nice flawless
canvas and I'm gonna go ahead and take
the brow bar to go by whitening
lightening and Kylie has really gorgeous
bold eyebrows now hers are definitely
more arched than mine so I kind of tried
to help create that a little bit but you
can definitely tell in her pictures when
she does her eyebrows the outer half is
a lot darker than the inner half of her
eyebrow and it just looks so natural and
beautiful and that's what I'm just
trying to achieve here
and then this is a palette i depotted a
bunch of wet and wild shadows in but I'm
just gonna hit take this one specific
shade and it's just a little bit lighter
than my natural skin tone and I'm just
gonna apply this all over the lid since
Kylie doesn't really put a lot of color
on her lids when she does this look and
we're gonna also take soft Brown by Mac
because I just wanted to add a little
bit more definition to my eyes so I'm
just lightly applying this to my crease
putting most of the color on the outer
half
now I'm going in with my Maybelline
master precise and I love this as well
gives you a really nice winged out liner
and Kylie when she does our liner she
does do the wing but she does not bring
it in all the way to the tear duct she
actually stops like right I'd say about
I don't know one third in like she does
not go all the way to the tear duct
so you'll see I'll go ahead and I do the
wing and the night stop right about
let's see right about here right there
is where she stops her eyeliner so she
doesn't take it all the way in she just
likes to take it in a little bit to make
it look natural but then wing the rest
of it out
now the Jenner family is really well
known for their amazing lashes even if
they have false lashes on or just
natural lashes they have amazing lashes
so I'm just going to take the L'Oreal
telescopic shocking extensions and apply
this all over I do have really long
lashes so I don't have to add anything
extra but if you want to have kind of
more of that natural lash that that are
really long and nice and full I
definitely recommend individual lashes
it will help you achieve that
now I'm taking some of the mascara on
the back of my hand and I'm taking a
eyeliner brush now I don't want to put
eyeliner down there or a shadow because
it's just a little too harsh so I take
just a little bit of this mascara and
run right along my lower lash line and I
get it really really close to my
waterline because I want to look as
natural as possible and this is gonna
help make the lower lash line look a lot
fuller you know then it actually is so I
love this little trick it works really
great and I'm going to go ahead and take
the Mac my line skin finish and give me
Sun and I am gonna add a little bit
definition to my face mainly applying it
in the outer parts of my face and where
does someone actually hit so that's all
I'm doing with this
ok so now we're going to go ahead and
take off that lip balm and I'm gonna go
ahead and take the Maybelline lipliner
this is in 50 red this is a true true
red it is beautiful and I love this lip
liner now it looks like I'm going fast
when I'm doing this but I swear it took
me so long because I fast forward this
part but I'm being really careful in
outlining my lips I want it to be as
sharp and as clean as possible and I
really just want to be very very careful
with this step because trying to take
red lip liner away or red lipstick away
is a lot harder than just taking your
time and putting it on so I am sort of
shading it in to because I don't want to
take the lipstick all the way up to the
creases of my Cupid's bow so I am
filling it in just a little bit and I'm
gonna be taking this wet and wild Fergie
lipstick this is in Sarah Gina I'll put
the name down below it's a gorgeous
gorgeous red even though I think Kylie
usually has a Mac red I think this one's
just as great so I'm just gonna put this
all over my lips and like I said I don't
really like to take it up towards the
Cupid's bow because sometimes it can
make it look not as sharp so I'm going
to go ahead and take an eyeliner brush
with some lip product on it and I'm
really just gonna shape out my lips make
sure it looks really nice and clean and
it doesn't look at smudgy anywhere on my
lips because her lipstick looks
phenomenal like just so gorgeous so
making sure you get that nice sharp lip
and don't forget you can always go in
with concealer if you do messed up and
I'm gonna go ahead and take my Tarte
eyelash curler so I'm just gonna take
this and curl my lashes just to get them
nice and flared out again cuz I felt
like they were a little droopy and
Kylie's are really nice and flared out
and just amazing so I hope you guys
enjoyed this this is the final look I
did add a little bit of eyeliner on my
top waterline just to really make the
top line look really nice and black but
that's all I did I hope you enjoyed this
is a nice classic look and if you try it
out send me a picture love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
