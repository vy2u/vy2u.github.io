with you about the Kylie cosmetics
liquid lipsticks and before you start I
just wanted to say I did buy these
myself I was online if you follow me on
snapchat you were with me I was waiting
and trying to get through it took me
forever the other two times before I
think was like two or three launches
before I didn't even try because I was
like I don't feel like doing it but this
time I found out what date and what time
she was doing it because I look at her
comments and I find out there because
people usually tell each other so
luckily one day I was on the site on the
dot and I was able to pick up five
shades and I accidentally picked up two
extra so I'll be giving away twenty-two
and true brown K which is when I'm
wearing right now but stay tuned until
the end to see how you can enter that V
I ordered those two by accident because
I didn't realize how many I had in my
cart cuz I was rushing so much to try
and get through and get these so I could
review them for you guys so I got the
colors true brown k I also got court k22
Dulce K and Kandy K which KD K I've
heard is like one of the most popular
ones personally I'm a dulce K girl
that's my favorite and 22 but I'm going
to show you guys swatches I'm gonna
review everything for you in this video
so when I was checking out I put
everything in my bag and it took
probably I would say like seven minutes
for me to get completely through I put
everything in my car in about two to
three minutes I know that's crazy but I
was just sitting there selecting all of
them
I forget what shade that I had in my
basket I'll leave it right here
but as I was checking out and it was
refreshing and taking forever to process
that one immediately went out it took
like less than a minute for that one to
get out of my basket took a few minutes
to get these it was a little bit
stressful and I know a bunch of people
want these liquid lipsticks and lip
glosses so I totally get why the site is
just slowing down and kind of crashing
you know she has a lot of fans so you
can't expect it to work perfectly every
single time you just kind of got to be
on your A game and go through and do the
process but it took me a while to
actually want to do the process because
I knew it was going to be difficult so
that kind of sucks but keep in mind what
you want before you go and order and
just know exactly what time that they're
on the site
get there a few minutes before because
otherwise it's just going to be mayhem
so when I got all of my Kylie cosmetics
in the mail they came in this box that
you guys all know I was hoping I got the
signed ones because she was signing the
ones that were going out and I was like
oh I hope I get one but I didn't I
didn't they're just plain so they came
like this and they had them wrapped in
this little thing they just had them all
laying right here there was I think four
in each box so I had gotten two boxes in
the mail so the thing that I did not get
in this packaging is the little slip or
like the little what do you call like
the little card that she wrote on or
it's printed on but whatever and it has
the lips on it I didn't get any of those
in my boxes which is a real
disappointment because I was excited to
get them and I didn't get a card at all
I know that's like such a little thing
but it is part of the packaging and I
was looking forward to it so I'm really
bummed that I didn't get that in any of
my boxes so that's kind of like one con
for me I was just I was really looking
forward to it I know I'm a loser but I
wanted it for the video and I just
wanted to keep it because I love the
design that she has but I do like the
rest of it the packaging and just how
simple it is and I just think it's
really cool I don't know I really like
this and before we keep going with this
video one of my friends actually did
send over the glosses so if you guys
want I'll do a review and try on with
these if you're interested I'm really
excited to try them because I really
like all of these colors and so far they
look beautiful on everybody that I've
seen so if you do want to see these on
give this video a thumbs up and let me
know and I'll give you a full honest
review and we'll see how well those work
out looking on her site and she's gonna
sell her ear and rain um liquid
lipsticks separately with no lip liner
and they're gonna be $18 but these are
$29 each with the liquid lipstick and
the lip liner and what one did I not get
coke okay coke okay was the one that
actually just like disappeared out of my
cart and I was like hey I'm going to go
through each shade let you know what I
like what I don't like and everything
like that the shipping did take quite a
long time mine took around like two
weeks I was really looking forward to
getting this video up sooner but it just
wasn't happening because they weren't
here long enough and I wanted to do a
full review
instead of a first impression because I
just wanted to wear them and contest
them out before I came on here and told
you my thoughts so the first color is
candy kay like I said I did do swatches
so it'll probably be in the side panel
here I love the boxes that she has I
think these are slow sleek and beautiful
I love the design I feel like this is
her and I just love everything about it
it's just a lot of detail a lot of
people are kind of joking around about
the Kylie's tips which says Lions look
with line lips with lip liner fill in
lips little color and everybody just
kind of like uh-huh okay but I love the
detail I actually have not kept these
out of their box I've been putting them
in my purse as I've been going
throughout the day and I just I love
them I think they're such a staple and
they're just beautiful so I probably
won't throw these out so again like I
said they do come with a lip liner and
then the liquid lipstick I know a lot of
people want her to really separate these
so you could just buy the lip liner or
the liquid lipstick but personally I
like the fact that she had the combo
because for some of these colors I
didn't have a lip liner for that color
like true brown kay I didn't have a lip
liner that would match that perfectly
same with 22 so I personally would have
purchased these together but I totally
get the fact that people want them
separate just in case you run out the
just in case you run out of the lip
liner first or the liquid lipstick you
know you can you don't have to purchase
them all together so I totally get that
I hope she does that in the future
because I think it would really benefit
a lot of people and I do love the
packaging of the liquid lipstick I think
it's really sleek and pretty I love the
black top and then of course the
see-through too I just think this is
really nice and she does have the name
on the bottom as well one of the things
I don't like is how much product comes
out on the wand I don't know if like the
stoppers are just not stopping enough
product but it's like clumping up and it
looks like it just wants to drip off so
I'm gonna put that back in there it's
the only thing I don't like about this
packaging but everything else I love I'm
pretty sure this is just hard plastic it
feels really good I think it looks
really sleek I've seen some people say
that this is cheap but I don't think
this is cheap I think this looks really
nice so love that and I also love the
lip liner this is a lip liner that you
are going have to sharpen so just keep
that in mind make sure you have a
sharpener
but I also love that she has the color
on the end as well the lip liners are
really nice and smooth you could
actually use this as like a lipstick if
you wanted to if you didn't want to go
over it with the liquid lipstick that's
because they blend out really well and
they look really nice on the lips so I
love this so much and I really do like
Kandy K it's like a pinky nude a little
bit of a darker pinky nude on my skin
tone and I like it a lot I love the way
that these dry I know she's changed her
formula a couple times if you follow her
on Instagram she updates you like on her
Kylie cosmetics Instagram she'll update
you and let you know if she's you know
changed and packaging if she's changed
formulas and I know that she's changed
the formula this to be thinner you know
just not as thick on your lips and for
it to dry a little bit quicker and I
know what the lip glosses she has also
changed the wand on that so she's always
just trying to tweak it and make it
better which I appreciate I'm glad I
didn't get these the first go-around
because I saw just a lot of negative
reviews on the site and on YouTube but
these I think feel really comfortable it
doesn't feel like it's just completely
drying out my lips it feels like a matte
liquid lipstick and I like that it's
something that I'm used to if you're not
used to a liquid lipstick and you try
these out you'll probably think it's dry
to me it feels good it kind of feels
velvety but a little bit more of a matte
too velvet if that makes any sense it's
just really smooth and it doesn't go
into like my fine lines or anything like
that and crack on me so I like this a
lot the one thing I will say is I cannot
build these up if I tried to build them
up then they will get uncomfortable so
if you just put on one layer you should
be good to go and it will be the most
comfortable for you I like candy Kay
it's not my personal favorite but I know
it looks good on so many different skin
tones and it is a pretty color onto my
favorite this is Dulce kay this is such
a beautiful shade again the same
packaging the one thing I've noticed
about these darker shades is they come
off really quickly here in the inner
part of my bottom lip especially Dulce
Kay when I wore this out for a long
period of time it just started to wear
off in the inner part and it really
bothered me and I just couldn't seem to
get it to stay on that's the only
drawback with this one I feel like I
constantly have to try to put more in
the inner part of the lip but otherwise
I love
this color this is my favorite color of
the bunch I have a second favorite but
this is definitely my go-to I love the
darker taupe II nudes I think it's
beautiful and the formula on this one is
really really great so don't say k is
definitely one that I recommend and then
another one that I recommend is 2222 is
beautiful I feel like so many people are
scared of this because it is more of
like an orange color but it doesn't make
your teeth look yellow whatsoever makes
them look really nice and white and I
feel like once it dries down it just has
this warmth hint and I think it's just
beautiful I did do a tutorial if you
want to check it out I'll leave it right
here you kind of see a little preview
but I did a really bold orange makeup
look and I thought it looked beautiful
and I did use this lip kit in it and it
was one of my favorite looks that I've
done in a while so have some faith for
2222 is beautiful just try it out it
looks so good on fair skin tones all the
way up to the darker skin tones I just
love this color I think it's so unique
this one and don't say Kay are by far my
two favorites and the ones that I would
recommend if you're gonna pick some up
okay this one is called Kourt K this is
more of the purple color and I don't
like this one at all you'll see in the
demo that this one is so patchy and you
just couldn't help but it to be patchy
like if you tried to apply more again
start and get thick and dry and kind of
crack it was very uncomfortable and it
was still patchy so this is the one I
had the most trouble with and I just
don't like it as much and I pretty much
regret buying this because I was looking
forward to it I love the darker purple
colors I'm definitely in love with the
lipliner I think this is beautiful so we
great for the darker colors that I have
maybe for a Mac or something but this is
a no-go I would suggest not buying this
until she changes his formula and like
updates you that has changed because it
is the patchy us one of the bunch and it
does not look good at all so that's just
my opinion I was pretty excited about
this one but it just it just did not
work so that's kind of a bummer and then
the last one is true round K this is the
one I have on now I love this one this
is completely opposite from cocoa K
because this one is not patchy at all
my first saw she was coming out with
liquid lipsticks I was most
about this one because it was like in
the colder months and I love darker
colors like this and this is the most
true Brown like literally true brown
that I have ever seen in a liquid
lipstick it's so beautiful such a bold
color and I think it's great and the
formula feels really good you don't have
to apply a couple layers of this because
it's not going to be patchy at all only
thing is again it does kind of wear down
here but it doesn't look terrible you
can just tell that you know you have a
line there which kind of stuck I love
this color though I think it is
beautiful I think so many different
people can wear it's bold it's fun and
it's the best Brown liquid lipstick I
have seen so moving on to the longevity
of this these liquid lipsticks lasts
forever when I had 22 on and I did that
tutorial I was eating drinking talking I
was just doing whatever and a little bit
did come off here in the center but the
rest of it was super intense and bold
and nothing was moving these do stay on
really well through eating drinking
kissing whatever and then whenever you
want to take it off makeup remover takes
it right off like that so I do love that
I think they are definitely worth it
because they stay on for so long and
that's what you look for in a liquid
lipstick and I don't find that they get
super uncomfortable throughout the day
if you have to keep layering and
building and building on your lips it's
going to be uncomfortable but if you
just touch up where a little bit has
rubbed off for maybe like eating
something I know I was eating like a
burrito remember then you should be fine
it's not going to be very uncomfortable
and I do have a few lines on my lips I
don't have really intense lines I just
have you know normal lines that
everybody has on their lips and I didn't
find that it cracked or anything like
that it hasn't like rubbed off I don't
know this was a quick video yet but I
just want to come on here and let you
guys know about these liquid lipsticks
let you know which ones I think you
should skip on which the ones I think
you should buy I really like the formula
I had high hopes and they really met to
my expectations on one that did it was
this one was just horrible
sorry it was and the shipping I wish was
a little bit faster and again with the
packaging I wish there wasn't so much
that came out on that wand but I think
she's just going to keep working with it
and trying to make it better which is
great it's great that she's listening to
