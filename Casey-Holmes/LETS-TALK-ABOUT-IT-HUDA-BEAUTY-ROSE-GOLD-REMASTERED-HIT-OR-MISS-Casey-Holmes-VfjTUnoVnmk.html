video it's going to be all about the new
Hooda Beauty rose gold revamped palette
I do have the old one here and we have
the new one and we're gonna see what's
different if this one's better if I like
this one more honestly I didn't even
notice this was discontinued for a while
until people had told me in one of my
recent videos the very first video I did
with this I think it was my Instagram
hype - makeup look that got a lot of
views I got a lot of like backlash for
not loving this palette not loving the
texture of these having to use my finger
I just wasn't a big fan of I never was
and then I started using my fingers more
because I wanted to use the shadows
because they're pretty and then now
she's revamped it so I'm very interested
to see how this palette performs if it's
the same as this one
but it's supposed to be 10 times better
like the mattes are supposed to be
better the shimmers all of that the
packaging is different it has a mirror
there's just a lot of different things
going on with this powder talk about all
that today because I asked you guys on
instagram if you wanted a comparison
video and y'all were like yes and it's
what we're here for I'm bringing it to
you today I'm actually filming right now
well duh filming you today the day that
you are seeing this and I'm putting it
up because I'm very interested in this
palette if you are new here don't forget
to subscribe before you leave and hit
that post notification bell so you are
notified every single time I upload a
video I try to upload it three times a
week at least two to three a week so
yeah also let me know down below what
videos you guys want to see next because
I am pre filming some videos and when we
going out of town very soon you can
follow me on my blog channel to see what
I'm up to it while I'm gone but I do
want to pre film for you guys I have a
favorites video that's gonna go up
makeup tutorial a first impression so
yeah just let me know what you guys want
to see you down below I'm thinking of
also doing a spring haul and like a
morning routine or something I got a lot
to film in a short amount of time so
definitely interested to hear your
thoughts so if you want to see what I
think about this new revamped huda
Beauty rose gold palette then let's just
go ahead and get started you put my hair
up first because I got a new bandana
it's green first rose gold palette that
I ever got I did purchase myself from
Sephora and I purchased it because it
was super hyped up on Instagram I needed
it for a video I didn't buy it just
because I absolutely had to have it I
definitely bought it for the video no it
is a beautiful palette and it's become
one of my favorites throughout
my time here on YouTube because I think
that video was like a year old maybe two
years I don't know but I will say a few
months like before the end of last year
I did get put on the PR list which I'm
super grateful for because I do love a
lot of her products and being on PR list
is great because I can just try a bunch
of different things for you guys and see
what works and what doesn't work even
like products that I wouldn't normally
buy like if it just doesn't draw my
interest then I could still try them out
and let you guys know what I think cuz
sometimes they'll work and sometimes
they don't know this is what the to look
like of course this is the original rose
gold palette it had the clear front
which I have to say I did not mind the
clear front I do like seeing all the
colors I felt like it was easy to pick
through I also loved this on the end -
because I store my palettes like this in
my drawer so I can see what they were on
top take a good look at these shimmer
shadows and they look completely
different in here so this is the new
revamped one right here and I'm gonna
just open this up it's completely
different packaging than this other one
I don't know if you guys have seen it
yet if you follow trend move you've
probably seen it this is what it looks
like I think she looks absolutely
gorgeous I really love the detail in her
packaging because like her highlighters
and stuff like you get that glow on them
and it's just super cool I think it's
very unique so again this is a newer
package with hooda on the front and then
you still have the rose gold remastered
here on top you get this sleeve in here
which is super pretty as well and then
then this palette you get a mirror and
then these are the shades again so I'm
gonna hold them up side by side so you
guys can see what it looks like they are
a little bit different actually quite a
bit different you don't get as many
mattes in this new palette you see the
old and the new she took out one mat two
mats so she took out two mats yeah she
definitely okay so the bottom row is
pretty much all the same the second row
you still have like that hot pink in
there a little bit of a mauve shade a
mauve shades a little bit more pink now
and then the darker tone and this
palette is definitely more purple in
this one and then she took out like this
matte shade which kind of sucks because
I did like having that in this palette
and this one looks like this shade and
she she changed up a couple shades in
that and you can see there is
differences again this is a remastered
palette it's not identical so I'm gonna
try to use shades that are pretty much
the same in both palettes and we'll see
what the difference is and how they
perform this one is discontinued by the
way you
I believe cannot get this you can get
like dupes of it but not the exact
palette I wish I can remember how much
it was but I cannot remember at all I
could just want it maybe like 48 dollars
and I looked at some comments on certain
pages and like I feel like the they're
very back and forth some people are
pissed some people aren't because they
spent money on it and then they decided
to redo it guess that I did purchase the
first one and spent my money on that and
I ended up enjoying it hey if you want
to be better be better you know what I'm
saying like change which you want to
change because she has her name on it so
it officially hits shelves on May 22nd
I'm not seeing a price anywhere
sorry about that guys once I figure out
the information I will definitely put it
in the video it's 18 eyeshadows before
ready to layer textures eight buttery
mattes eight melted metals one wet and
dry jet-black
Oh wet and dry jet-black and one
highlighting pressed pearl says the
newly formulated metallic shadows are so
blinding which makes it every
instagramers dream come true the creamy
molten formula allows you to apply it
easily with a brush with a brush or with
your finger as a final touch for a more
amplified finish the black truffle
shadow can be used for a wet sharp
winged liner or dry for an intense smoky
look moon dust pretty is the ultimate
highlighting shade for the lids inner
corner of the eye or on the cheekbones
for an extra glow we are totally trying
that out today it says this transformed
palette features Beauvoir 18 talc free
eyeshadows with smoother textures you
design shades for a softer color harmony
and the most insane metal fondant on
your lids okay so we're just gonna get
right into it I'm gonna use a primer
because I always use primer for
eyeshadows I never not use a primer and
I'm gonna apply this all over my lid
this is the Smashbox photo finish shadow
primer so like I said I'm gonna try to
keep most the color similar just so we
can see what's different if it's better
even though you can't buy the old
palette I think if you have the old
palette it's good
to see what is different and if you
should buy this remastered palette I
think it's really helpful so that's what
we do on let's get in let's get into
this cuz I'm talking away to damage so
on this I I'll do the old this one I'll
do the new so for the old I am gonna
take this shade right here this is the
shade bay you can see how pigmented that
is I'm gonna set my entire lid with that
and then for the other eye I'm actually
just gonna take a powder so I'm gonna
use the Marc Jacobs powder that I've
been using recently it's the perfecting
coconut setting powder and I'm gonna set
the other lid since we don't have
anything to really set with in this new
palette usually if I have nothing to set
the lid with I'll just use a powder
because I don't like having a sticky
base when I go in with eyeshadows
alright now we're gonna go in with
transition shades in the old palette I
will be taking a sandalwood and I'm just
gonna use a fluffy crease brush so I'm
gonna clean my brush in between each dip
with the pallets because I have this dry
brush spray so I can do that taking
clean brush going in with sandalwood
left this into the crease I really
should just brought out more eye shadow
brushes for this but you know here we
are it's really not bad just an easy
transition color so I'm gonna clean my
brush again and I'm gonna go in with
sandalwood again which is in this new
palette it's the same exact name looks
like the same exact shade I'm gonna take
my clean brush with that color
definitely has more fallout just FYI I
don't know if you guys can see the
powder on this one and we're gonna put
that into a crease
I'm so interested to hear your opinions
on this palette you guys let me know
down below in the comments what you
think about this remastered palette like
are you mad that she came out with it
again or because you purchased the last
one or are you totally okay with it
because she's probably a perfectionist
like the rest of us okay
so there's a new there's the old do you
think it looks a little bit softer
blended a little bit easier if you guys
can see next up I'm going to take this
shade this is in the shade henna and
again very pigmented have a dog hair on
mine and I'm gonna put this into the
crease she using a Mac 217 I love my Mac
blending brushes I use them constantly
I've had them for years and I just can't
get over them so I love my Mac brushes
so we're going to build it up right here
in the outer V and then take the rest of
it into the crease
so that's what henna looks like on this
eye then I'm going to clean the brush
again and we're gonna take the same
shade henna and the new palate that's
right by sandalwood this one right here
so we're really gonna work this out
I definitely feel like this side is
blending better than this side what do
you guys think so far to see I was able
to blend this like I went into this
palette once to pick up color and I
blended it all here into the crease all
throughout the lid and you can see how
different its blending I promise I did
the exact same thing on this side so it
definitely is blending better in my
opinion like I feel like it's the amount
of shadow you have on your brush goes
farther than the old one okay so I'm
gonna take this brush right here and I'm
gonna go in with man-eater and it's the
same and the other palette as well and
I'm going to toss this like in the
crease like right in the middle just for
a nice pop of color right there so I'm
taking it right here in the center and
just kind of going back and forth I'm
letting the brush follow that socket and
we're just lightly blending this out so
again just like pop it in here and go
back and forth
next up we're going to be taking like
the hot pink shade in these pallets this
one is doll wait no this one in the old
palette is named flamingo and it's doll
face in the new palette the Mingo does
look a tiny bit lighter like a more pink
swoon kind of look and doll faces a
little bit darker but just FYI I'm gonna
take flamingo and the old palette I'm
gonna put this one right here up front
in the front of the eye look just to add
some lighter pink in there don't worry
we will clean this up I just kind of
want to add different colors in here and
see how it looks
hopefully I don't put money in this
video we will find out
so again just take that right in there
and blend it back
all right now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take two Mac 217 brush is I'm
gonna clean these off and we're gonna
use them one for one pallet one for the
other so well I'm not going to stand
alone with my Mac 217 and we're just
going to touch up this outer half and
make sure it's all nice and blended some
being super light with this I just want
to look nice and faded no harsh lines
you know then I'm gonna take the other
brush and take sandalwood in this
palette and do this the same exact thing
again we're just extending that out and
blending these edges kind of my opinion
this eye looks better I don't know what
you guys think also gonna go in with
henna and touch up this outer V area
I'm just deepen it up and I'm gonna do
the same exact thing with the other
brush and the other palate so we're
gonna go in with henna
this little wet wall pencil brush clean
it off and we're gonna go into the black
and they're both called black truffle in
both palettes so of course we're going
to take this one which looks pretty
black to me and we're just going to
create a nice deep outer V here so we're
gonna kind of follow the shape of the V
go up into the crease and then kind of
drag it out we're going to get this
looks super black
it's very pigmented this one is
definitely more pigmented and more black
I'm using a pretty stiff stiff brush
this one does look a little bit patchy
over here now what we're gonna do is
clean a brush and we're going to just
blend that out I'm not gonna put any
extra product on the brush right now I'm
just gonna go in with a clean one I'm
for real going in for y'all like I'm
cleaning these brushes every single time
okay now kind of back actually kind of
dust it away I never noticed that you
guys see it's like a light hint of black
and there's really not much on my brush
I've never noticed that about that
palette all right we'll do the same for
this eye
okay this one definitely has more
product on the brush than the other I
did know I feel like they're kind of
blending the same I'm gonna go in again
with a clean blending brush and I'm
gonna take henna we're gonna blend out
the edges of the black so we're just
gonna try to make a look a little bit
better cuz I probably just effed it all
up with this black I feel like more than
anything I kind of had to just cover it
up with henna and really put a lot of
that eye shadow down to make it look
blended but it's definitely not blended
maybe next time I'll have to use it with
a fluffy blending brush instead of that
stiff wet and wild brush let's move on
to the fold I shadow I want to see what
they look like so I'm gonna put some
concealer down because that's what I
like to do for really intense eye
shadows like this we're gonna carve out
our lid so I will be using the mac 242
to apply concealer and apply the fold I
shadow so first we will take the
concealer I don't want to go too much
over that pink because I do want it to
show through you know okay so just like
that and then I'm gonna show you guys
what it looks like whenever you use your
brush first with the fold eyes shadow
oh that got really southern I'm gonna
show you guys what it looks like first
when you use the brush with the fold i
shadow x' and then when you use your
finger that's fine is what I'm gonna use
so in this palette it's this one right
here I'm gonna use the brush first I
know you're not supposed to use the
brush with these eyeshadows but I'm just
we're gonna see we're gonna see today
what the difference is you know so we're
just going in with the brush first I'm
digging my brush in here and that's what
I'm getting pretty much nothing now I'm
gonna take my finger looks like that
much better right that was the thing
with this pallet you had to use your
finger the only thing like I don't I
will use my finger for my pallet but the
only thing that I just don't like is I
like to be very precise I guess you
could say and like when it starts
getting up here above where I carved out
my lid that's what I'm like oh I can't
fix it with a brush because literally no
product gets on this brush you know what
I mean like it's so hard to really touch
it up and make it look clean
that's that I'm gonna clean my brush now
and we're gonna carve out this other eye
and then now we're going to go straight
into trust-fund in this palette so this
is what trust-fund looks like in this
palette and then Trust Fund in this one
so you can see the difference between
this guy and how much smoother this one
looks so that's the new that's the old
come on bring it home dad oh geez Louise
okay it's sad with the brush right it
looks the same as the other palette I'm
using my brush I'm swirling a lot into
this one now I'm gonna use my finger
and don't like that my brush didn't pick
up a lot of product with that normally I
don't have a problem going in with
concealer and then going straight in
with the eyeshadow that's probably what
I do because before the concealer dries
I like to go ahead and put that
eyeshadow on so it sticks to it and it's
really nice and pigmented I think
they're the same so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to finish out the rest of my
makeup and I'm going to apply just a
line on my top lash line just go ahead
and get a good look at what it looks
like right now I gotta clean this up but
this is what it looks like so far for
you guys in just a second okay guys so I
just finished up my face and I did my
lashes as well I did add a little bit
highlighter cuz I got a little crazy
because I was trying out this new
Smashbox kit that I got this makes me
look super bronzed and I'm I'm loving it
and the foundation I have on today is
the huda beauty foe filter foundation I
have the shade 3/10 on it is a little
light for me without bronzer but once I
put bronzer on and everything it's fine
it works out and so yeah I have the
shade 300 in for when I'm not s elf tant
and then I have three tin for when I
have a tan going so I love this
foundation it looks really good
heart-shaped 8 kkw mixed on my under
eyes so we're gonna do is move back on
to eyes I'm gonna go in with black
truffle and I'm gonna push this up
against that lower lash line okay and
then again we're gonna spray the brush
this hood of beauty foundation honestly
like everything is been looking so
flawless on my skin I've been loving it
and then I'm going to take my pencil
brush and I'm gonna take the sandalwood
shade and we're going to blend that out
I have to say I do really like the fact
that the new palette comes with a mirror
for times like this when I want to be
like right up in my eye
okay there is also a moon dust in the
old palette so we're gonna use this to
highlight the inner corner and
underneath the brow it's pretty but it's
nothing like too intense you know what I
mean okay in the inner corner that looks
good so again we're taking a moon dust
right here like with my with with my
finger okay there's something different
that Munda shade is like this would
apply with a brush amazingly it really
would because just the texture of it is
a little bit different than the other
ones I don't know what it is I'm excited
for this okay it does have its pretty
chunky I don't know if you guys can see
like the chunks on the brush it's
definitely there though I'm gonna very
care carefully put this in the inner
corner it is kind of chunky wow that is
a that's an inner corner highlight right
there it is different than the one in
the original - this one's more of like a
pink this one's definitely more gold so
this one is a bit more brighter so it
looks like gonna make this brow Wow
whoo that is pretty like this I was
pretty but this I is like super pretty
I'm going to apply this shade to my face
right because she says you can yeah so
you can use moondust to highlight your
face and that's what we're gonna do I'm
gonna take my honest Asya highlighting
brush that I always use I'm just gonna
put this like right in the center of my
cheek because it's super pigmented i
feel like it would accentuate my pores
but that's really pretty it's actually
took just up tiny bit down okay this is
like the Smashbox highlighter I did dust
off quite a bit of it because I knew I
was like I put it on and I was like oh
that's intense that is really pretty
well I am full glam today honey we I
play no games
see it does have quite a bit of Fallout
let me just show you guys that's moon
dust right there that's it on the brush
I love this is like a center of your
highlight I would I would call it like a
popper like this pops your highlight
seriously I will say I feel like you
would go through this in no time if you
use it as a face highlighter and an eye
shadow and you know what I thought it
would really accentuate texture but it's
it's really not bad at all like wow okay
if you're like me and you like to
highlight your brow bone with colors
like this and you're in a corner and you
like to kind of match your brow bone
highlight to your face highlight you're
definitely gonna go through it in my
opinion because it's such a soft shadow
I mean I could be wrong but that's just
what I'm thinking so far babe wait come
here for a second
which side which I do you like better
makeup wise like what I looks better to
you makeup wise I used two palettes that
are the same well they're not the same
ones re-mastered ones the old one I used
one on one eye one on the other
the same exact same saying I do too I
think so I like this I a little bit more
I feel like the Matt's blended out
better on the outer corners yeah I agree
on this left side it's a little darker
farthering well I can't see cuz my
lashes but this one right this one yeah
angry I like my right eye better too
okay thank you this is the final look I
want you guys to let me know what you
think what should I do you like better
do you like my right side better which
is your left or do you like my left side
which is your right let me know what
you're thinking I definitely like this I
more I like the highlight shades better
I do feel like the shade trust-fund
pretty much worked the same you couldn't
really use it with a brush in my opinion
at least with that shade I don't know I
was super excited to see if trust-fund
applied it well with the brush that was
like what I was most excited for
especially the mattes too but I
definitely think it's the same I don't
know if I could tell you to buy the
remastered palette if you already have
this one I think just go with your gut
if you want to have the newer formulas
and have the mattes blend out a little
bit better if you use it all the time I
would definitely get this palette but if
you don't really use this palette much
it's not your favorite
you could probably pass on it you know
it's definitely gonna be up to you let
me know what you guys think down below
in the comments I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video and me going back and
forth I cleaned my brushes a lot today
thank you all so much for watching and I
will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
