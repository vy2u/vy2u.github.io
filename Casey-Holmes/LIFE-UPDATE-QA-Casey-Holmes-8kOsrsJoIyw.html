in a chill outfit I just got done
blow-drying my hair I did a light makeup
alone very bronze right now I'm very
bronze but yeah I think it I would do a
Q&amp;amp;A for you I did like a little poll on
Twitter and a lot of you wanted me to do
an update soon a so that's what I'm
going to do today for you hey so I'm
Justin start answering your questions
giving you guys like a life update and
things like that beyond follow my vlog
channel you probably don't know too much
about me but if you want to know more
I've got a vlog channels that you should
check that out I'll leave a link for it
down below
Eddie asks what would be my dream
vacation and that would be just to go in
Bora Bora honestly I really want to go
to Bora Bora
so that Emma Elizabeth asks would you be
up for getting another puppy is so what
kind and I think this year we might get
another dog it depends on what's going
to go on with Davis and that's moving
and if we're going to stay somewhere for
a certain amount of time but we really
do want another dog just here but it
would be like Davis and dog you know
that I mean all the dogs are his dogs
that you know they love me more so
Courtney asked what is your favorite
thing to work out at the gym arms legs
at Sarah is definitely leg blending my
favorite but then after that I would
have to say probably AB the absence hard
to I used to never train ABS so my new
trainer has been making me do as though
it's good great is there a launch date
for your collab with Smashbox and well
if you sold like Ulta and Sephora stores
also if you didn't live in Georgia where
do you think you'd be living it isn't
being sold in ulties and Sephora and I
do know a date that wait can I promise
you I'm working so hard stay tuned this
is the month to look out for I will tell
you that keep a lookout make sure you
follow me on snapchat snapchat is going
to know where it's at most the time
Instagram my facebook those are that's
the first line of social media that I'm
going to go for and also if you didn't
live in Georgia where do you think you
would live I don't know somewhere maybe
in the south maybe in like Tennessee or
something like that I also love to live
in Colorado whoo what video changed it
all for you what made you think wow
YouTube is my career damn I don't know
that's a really good question I wish I
could remember that I remember putting
my job though because I really hated my
job and I'd love the people I worked
with but I hated what I did when I
worked like what insurance or whatever
and I remember
the day that I was sitting there I was
like I can't do this anymore I was
making good money with YouTube but it
wasn't my consistent you know what I'm
saying so I knew taking that leap
leaving my job for YouTube was going to
be a stretch it's a scary scary thought
but I knew once I quit that job I had to
work my ass off on YouTube I had to
invest in my camera equipment things
like that really make it a full-time
thing and taking that leap and quitting
just made everything else blow up I mean
I had more time to work I was able to
create different content and like post
more there's getting back in the gym do
you have a meal plan if so what do you
eat I I don't really have like a meal
plan I was eating like subscription
meals for a while there and then I just
that's a different story in itself I
mostly eat like chicken and rice and
broccoli I know that's like so bland and
so annoying but like last night I had a
burrito - so I mean I can't really like
cook I don't really have like a meal
plan I don't really meal prep in the
mornings I've been having like an
oatmeal with a half of a banana and then
I have a smoothie after I work out I
have a couple snacks during the day
because the avocados toast it could be
like breakfast sometimes I have
breakfast for dinner sometimes to have
my vegetable soup that you guys know I'm
obsessed with and then I sometimes have
my chicken rice and broccoli I'm kind of
like a creature of habit when it comes
to food like I can eat the same thing
over and over and over again so that's
why it's just weird but then there will
be that one point when I'm like alright
I'm done I need to figure out something
ciarán I think then I always see you
blog so many and Larry protein cookies
do you like them also do you feel like
you need to work out after eating them
so you don't gain weight or are they
just good for a midday snack as well I
love Lennie and Larry cookies but the
only time I eat them is if I'm craving
something sweet and half the time
already have two cookie unless I might
go full and you know at that time of
month I gotta have the whole cookie but
otherwise I normally eat them if I have
not ate at all that day like if I am
just hungry I don't have time to cook I
need something that's really gonna fill
me up then I'll have one of those
protein cookies but I don't have one
like everyday you know what I'm saying
did you travel anywhere with Davis where
would it be
we've been talking
I went to Europe he's already been to
Europe but I have not so I think it
would be super cool to go together and
him like show me some things
tell me about things cause he eats he's
so smart he remembers everything yeah I
think we really wanna go to Europe
Europe would be really really fun with
him I think someone said have you and
Davis talked about marriage
yes we have we've actually talked about
marriage then around October 2015 we
talked about for a very long time
someone say what do you think should be
the best Valentine gift for my partner
and what are you planning for Davis
Valentine's I love you like a CEO thank
you so I'm not getting Davis anything
because he'll be at Ranger school for
Valentine's Day I sent him two cards
like to open when letters for
Valentine's Day for him to have and what
I would give my poll would I get Davis I
don't know I've become more crafty
lately I would just give up like you
know open win letters I think that's so
cute I don't know if your guys like down
to that but I think Oakland win letters
are so fun just lift them up on
Pinterest and you can get some ideas
someone said what is your favorite song
right now that's perfect because I do
have a new favorite song so I just
discovered the other day it is Lady
Antebellum you look good
if you had to choose between never
wearing false lashes again our never
being able to use brow products what
would you choose I would choose no
falsies I would need some bro Katie said
you're such an amazing person to have
out there for girls to a substitute love
how genuine you are with everything and
true yourself have any travel plans when
you move to New York get ready for that
military lifestyle haha it's crazy yeah
I've heard
venez cruising I think I'm prepared but
I think you're not prepared until you
get there I'm very excited I don't have
any plans when I'm up there this year is
going to be the year that we find things
out see where we're going to live we're
going to live there for a long period of
time because something could happen they
just leave we're really on the fence
right now who is it going to be
permanent this year when we move out
there or if it's gonna be temporary for
me and you'll know more about it as your
goes on if it hey girl this is so random
but what kind of deep do you have I'm
buying in your car and love yours
praying for Davis oh thank you the Jeep
that I have is the Rubicon 2015 Rubicon
and I love it and then literally right
underneath this so it says I want to
know about your new car what is it I'm
really talked about my newest car a lot
of you do know it is Cadillac someone
asked if I saw if I was going to go back
to being a Burnett anytime soon and I
don't know like I love the lighter hair
I feel like I don't know it just
lightens me up a little bit but I might
go back to being a brunette at some
point what is one thing you like the
most about Davis and now that you're you
are successful and somehow accomplished
most of your goals in life what's your
next step thing I like the most about
Davis physically it's just asked and his
teeth and face that booty though one of
those three my next step I don't know my
next step is got to be a no-kill shelter
like that is my ultimate goal I mean you
guys have heard me say it a thousand
times but literally that is my goal a
lot of you guys are asking about Davis
so that's why I'm answering in this
video something you get a little bit
faster
when I talk about him but this is my
channel so if you don't like it you'll
have to watch but most of you are
interested in my relationship this one
says what's it like getting someone in
the military is it hard having a
long-distance relationship
and one thing I will say is like when I
when I first started going through this
Ranger school process if you don't know
Ranger school it's a whole ordeal you
can look it up on Google but you don't
get to talk to them at all you get to
talk to them through letters you don't
know until they call you at the very end
of the month if they pass the phase or
if they have to recycle then after you
hear from them you don't hear from them
again just through letters so it's like
everyday you don't get to talk to this
person like if you've been with this
person all the time and they're like
your best friend and then they leave you
have no contact it's hard some people
don't get that I think it's quite
interesting too because some people will
say that they don't think I'm as
independent now because I'm sad when I
don't get to talk to Davis or something
what it is is I don't get to talk to my
best friends I'm an independent ass
person and still running a business
running a household taking care of my
dogs I'm so independent if I wasn't I
would have someone here doing all of
this for me it's just sucks not talking
to the person that you love all the time
think of that one person that you have
your best friend your mom your dad
whoever it is and then automatically
getting cut off from them and not being
able to talk to them it is hard heavy
arm distance relationship it's kind of
not because then again when you get
together it's amazing it's always worth
it in the end and you also can kind of
do your own thing
when you need to do it you know what I'm
saying you still have control of your
schedule and then when you guys get
together you can take a break from
everything and get back to normal so I
didn't ask if I was a Christian and yes
I am so into where you get your creative
inspirations from I swear every time I
watch one of your vlogs I instantly want
to start a project or redecorate my room
well if it comes to household stuff we
can all just blame HGTV on that okay
that's all I watch HGTV and right now
army wives
are all I've been watching but HGTV has
many this is why I'm renovating my house
because I keep watching a damn show and
I just I'm thinking like okay I can have
more space in my bathroom if we do this
and this and I'm going to do this I love
it if I could do an interior interior if
I can be an interior designer I totally
would I find it so fascinating and fun
with every project I know I just
couldn't be that creative with it you
know what I'm saying whenever I do
little projects like the craft projects
that you guys have seen on my wall like
my
I'm just starts rolling when I'm in
Hobby Lobby or something I go through
each aisle and I just kind of think like
Oh what would I do with that we want to
do is that and if I really like the idea
then I'll try to execute it three months
excited for in 2017 I'm just excited to
see where we end up I'm excited to see
if we move for good I'm excited to see
this house renovated if you guys don't
know I'm keeping this house that's why
I'm renovating it excited to see where
Davis and I are at the end of the year
collab things like that I'm just super
pumped for things and just to see how
they work out and a lot of you are
asking me when do I want to have babies
I don't know don't know eh I pray that I
can have babies but B got to get married
first and then I'll have kids favorite
food when you're drunk lol -
cheeseburgers favorite food when I'm
drunk
don't really eat after I drink now
because used to I was go to IHOP at
Waffle House and girl I saw it - I saw
it um but if I did have to pick one it
would be Waffle House for sure so that
is it you guys I hope you enjoyed this
