mind the way I look I know I look
terrible have like flakes of dry shampoo
in my hair because I've been using a
white dry shampoo oh look a hot mess
haven't brushed my hair but I'm getting
ready to start my day no go out and take
some photos and run some errands and I
figured I would show you guys how this
foundation wears now I don't know if
this colors gonna match me perfectly I
am at my lightest right now this is like
my natural skin color and I did buy a
foundation to match that hopefully it
matches if not we'll just have to like
bronze the neck a little bit or a lot of
it I figured instead of just sitting
here and letting you know what I think
about this product I figured I would
just show you taking throughout my day
and we will do another wear test on it
I've tried this quite a few times since
I purchased it and I don't really like
it I feel like it looks very cakey I
feel like it doesn't wear very well I
mean it looks disgusting around the nose
area I first it looks really beautiful
but as I wear it personally it does not
look good on me I'm just gonna show it
to you guys and we're gonna watch and
see how it works together I'm gonna try
this one more time on camera the
lightest shade that I have is 305
natural beige that we don't know it does
have just a little squeezy tube which I
kind of like some people don't like that
but I think it's kind of nice and it is
more of like a mousse foundation it's
pretty thick it is gonna be matte so
just keep that in mind if you're one to
purchase this product I'm going to show
you guys two different ways to apply it
I'm going to show you with a beauty
sponge I'm also going to show you with a
brush but first I'm going to use my
regular primers I've been using my
regular primers with this so this what
I'm going to do today first step is the
Smashbox primer water and then we're
going in with a brand new bottle of my
Cain and Austin mattifying primer which
I love I just got this new bottle in the
mail thank God I was running so low my
other one I've seen a lot of mixed
reviews on this foundation it's
definitely I don't I don't know I feel
like I've seen a couple good reviews but
mostly reviews I've seen people have had
a problem with it right now I'm going to
take the brush first we're gonna do the
brush on the left side this is the it
cosmetics CC perfecting brush I really
like this brush and I'm just going to
put this on okay it's not terrible I'm
gonna put it on the brush now I'm just
showing you both ways to apply it now
this is pretty fast drying so you have
to work quickly with it and it on me it
is pretty full coverage I mean look at
that look at
signe look at this side again I'm going
to take it on my forehead cover up some
of this redness that we've got so when I
had dry patches last week on my forehead
this looked terrible I feel like if you
have any dry patches on your skin you're
not going to like this product because
it is going to cling to them I think
this product is really more for people
with oily skin or maybe even normal as
long as you're not super dry and use a
hydrating primer I'm telling you when I
first put this on I love the way that it
looks but it's just the way it wears
throughout the day that I don't like and
believe it or not this color is not
terrible I mean it's a little off but
it's not terrible so thank God because
it looks pretty dark on my hand you know
what I'm saying this is before and this
is the after really nice full coverage I
like it with a brush now I'm going to
take a spine we're going to use the
japonesque one and put this on my face
this way so you're gonna kind of see the
difference in how it applies at least I
could see the difference I feel like a
brush just looks better a brush really
blends it in you don't have as much
texture and you use a sponge on if you
can see but it kind of sits in one area
doesn't necessarily blend out so I would
not use a sponge with this product use
your favorite foundation brush that you
have based on here's what it looks like
they say it's a natural finish I believe
on the packaging let's see it says the
coverage is high I agree with that I
feel like some people don't agree with
that but I definitely agree with the
high coverage and it says the finish is
natural which I don't agree with I think
this is very matte very very matte and I
don't know where they get natural from
because there's like no shine on my face
I'm going to go ahead and really
honestly truly so while those lights
warm back up I'm gonna quickly finish
the rest of my face get ready for the
day and I'll come back and show you guys
an actor when my full face is completed
okay so I'm back I look a little bit
more like a human I want to show you
what it looks like right now so you can
see kind of up close and personal don't
mind my brow this brow is such bitch it
looks really good right now like once
it's set
chillin sinking into the skin I brought
us a little bit so it matches a little
bit more probably needed a little bit
more bronzy this is what it looks like
right now and it is total 144 p.m. so
when you guys see me next I'm going to
be a little bit more presentable after
that I'm gonna put on false lashes and
stuff in a little bit yeah we'll keep
you guys updated lip color is the
Jordana sweet cream matte lip lip in the
shade Sandman toast I'll see you guys in
just a few hours so I'm in my car right
now actually at Starbucks I figured I'll
give you guys a little update on this
foundation so going in it does oh I got
my scare on my lip I want you guys to
see like the texture how bad looks it
was Matt for a while but like it goes on
to all of the texture that I have if I
have even just a little bit underneath
my eyes something that's you know kind
of natural to have a little bit of
texture underneath here it kind of just
accentuates it and in natural light it
just looks terrible it's starting to
kind of cake up around my nose I have to
actually go shoot an outfit here in a
few minutes and luckily we're not close
up in face shot so you can't see this
kind of stuff but if we were doing face
shots it would really suck I mean just
see though how my texture looks it's
kind of accentuating my pores it looks
really good
in the beginning I feel like it always
does every time I try this foundation I
get so excited about it and then it just
goes south from there and it's been like
what two hours I don't remember the last
time I talked to you guys but that is my
update for now I just can't I can't deal
with this and right now as you can see
it is 4/16 I'm gonna get some coffee go
take some pictures and then do my
errands for the day and then I'll be
done and yeah I'll just take you guys
along for the next few hours wait till
you see how this kicks up around my nose
it looks so bad it is finally the end of
the night I just got done watching the
Alabama Clemson game I was a little
distracted for a few hours
it is 109 right
now and I really want to show you guys
how this foundation wore in the
beginning of the day it was like it
wasn't doing as bad as it normally has
like the past few times I've tried this
it's gotten cakey like this within like
probably six hours and it took a little
bit longer this time but I want to show
you kind of a little bit of what's going
on so this is what my skin looks like
you can see right here where everybody's
talking about getting cakey around the
nose it definitely gets cakey around the
nose we're getting up close and personal
right here you see how it's just oh God
looking at myself that close-up is hard
really quick I'm gonna take a blotting
sheet we're just gonna see how it looks
after I block this is you know normally
what I would do I haven't touched my
face in a few hours because I was
watching the game I'm going to take the
Pilate of blotting sheets and just pull
out my face oh it looks worse
normally this makes me look better this
is just the problem that I have with the
foundation it just it looks good for the
first two hours and then it just gets
cakey and there's no saving it look at
how oily I am ooh and it starts breaking
up on your forehead you see how it's
breaking out there there's just a lot of
problems with this foundation right
Daisy Daisy is literally right here
watching me guys I'm gonna show you
clear it's separating up here on my brow
rows did Paul my face right here but she
didn't touch my face over here and this
is just naturally fading away and it
just shows so oh my god looks it just
looks terrible you guys it just it's not
a long wear foundation didn't they say
it was 24 hours
honestly it might stay on for 24 hours
but it's gonna look cakey staying on for
that long let me know if you guys want
more reviews like this where I take you
