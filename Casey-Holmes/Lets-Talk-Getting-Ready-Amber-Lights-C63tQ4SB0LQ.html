getting ready and showing you guys new
makeup look that I had in my first
impression video that I uploaded Friday
and I also wore this look in another
video and I had so many requests to do
the makeup look and it's a pretty simple
look I just used you know shadows from
my Mac palette since I hadn't used it in
a while already primed my face with my
benefit Porefessional and my Mac prep
and prime skin refine zone
and I've also primed my eyes with my
NARS primer that I am obsessed with so
we're just going to go ahead and get
started with the eyeshadow okay so like
I said I did cry my eyes on my NARS
primer but I am going to put a base on
I'm gonna use my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre now the difference between the
NARS primer and the Mac Paint Pot is the
Mac Paint Pot doesn't have the best
creasing power like the NARS one does I
feel like the NARS one is just a
god-sent for oily eyelids but the Paint
Pot I like it because it evens out the
lid so the first color we're going to be
taking today these are all max shadows
that we'll be using and I'm gonna be
using saddle so I'm just gonna put this
all in my crease with a sigma brush I'll
have all the brushes I used listed in
the description box below
now we're going to take a flat shader
brush and we're going to take the color
amber rush or amber lights I'm sorry I
love this color I'm gonna place this
color all over my lid I love this color
it's like gotta be one of my favorite
colors from Matt okay now I'm going to
take this small taper blending brush
from Sigma you can see that it has a
pointed end which is going to make it a
little bit easier to get into the crease
oh my shadows look busted because I
dropped this so many times by mixing
these two more of Swiss chocolate than
anything then I'm going to place this in
the outer V and into the crease
you
I know it's looking messy now but it'll
come together I promise so into the
crease and the outer V it's kind of work
it in there
taking my original blending brush I'm
just going to blend out these lines
you
okay now I'm taking my Mac palette
and once you clean up these lines and if
you don't want to do this you want like
a clean edge from the beginning then you
can like really try to be precise you
could add tape you can do whatever you
want to do but I just find that this is
easier especially if you haven't done
your foundation and stuff and it's easy
just to kind of select some concealer
under there and clean it up a bit so it
still looks a little messy but we're
gonna come back in a minute and fix this
up today I'll be using my Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation in 3wn Thani I
have done a floor view on this if you
want to check it out I'll link it down
below I'm gonna apply it with my email
kabuki f-84 from Sigma my f80 is quite
dirty so we're gonna be using this today
and this color might what do you know it
might be a little light for me but I
have a sample of a darker color in my
purse and I really just don't feel like
going to get it so if it's a little
light will just bronze it up baby it'll
be okay
that's a little light but that's okay
rather be a little light than a little
too dark oh my the way I have people ask
me all the time since my face doesn't
match my neck if I go out without makeup
on yeah honey I go out all the time
without makeup on honestly I have
nothing to be ashamed of and if people
want to judge me for having a lighter
face because I don't self tan my face
then that's their problem not mine I'm
watching out for my skin so it really
doesn't bother me and don't be
embarrassed to go out without makeup on
sometimes you just gotta go out without
makeup on and if people want to judge
you screw them out time for a concealer
today I'm going to use a darker
concealer just because the foundation on
camera it looks like completely opposite
like so light but in person it's really
not that light one if it's cuz I have
like a shadow casting down here I'm
going to use just NC 30 today another
question I get all the time is hot why
you so much concealer in volleyball blah
blah and how it doesn't look cakey since
I do use so much personally i I think
one thing that really helps with making
sure your eye under eye concealer
doesn't look too cakey is making sure
it's properly moisturized
if your under-eye is not very
moisturized you know things are gonna
look cakey down there just like your
face if things are not mooster eyes it's
gonna cling to those dry patches right
so get a good eye cream and I use the
Bobbi Brown hydrating under eye cream
and it has changed my undereyes life I
mean I think that's a really big part of
my concealer not looking cakey and also
even though I do apply quite a bit it's
not a thick layer it's like a thin layer
of concealers okay now I'm going to take
my NARS translucent crystal powder I
have been using this quite a bit this
month since of my products the body
forgot it video I've done and I love
that video um it's really helping me use
my stuff up and I plan on doing it what
I plan on doing is doing my thought it
forgot it in the beginning of the month
showing you guys you know the products
that I'm going to you
and then the very next video I'll have a
getting ready of all those products and
then you know throughout the months
you'll see them in certain videos and
then at the end of the month I'm going
to do like a full review what every what
I do I regret buying it things like that
now I'm going on to my NARS powder this
is in mountain I'm so surprised I have
not even hit pan on this yet because
last time I had this I hit pan on it
quickly and I've been using this quite a
bit this year and I haven't hit pan yet
bronzer time I'm going to take the Too
Faced chocolate chocolate Soleil bronzer
and my NARS Ida eita the little flat
brush and watch contour if you guys like
to see an updated contour and
highlighting video I'll do that for you
guys just let me know but I know there's
so many and I personally watched Jaclyn
Hills video of how she contoured with
this brush because it kind of took me a
few times to figure out how I really
wanted to contour with it and after I
watched her video I really found that
her technique was the easiest so I
basically do it like that okay that's
done now we're gonna move on to blush
this isn't the blush that I used that
day but I want to use it I'm it's honey
jasmine from Mac this came out in a
collection all about orange collection I
think it was and I love this color I'm
using it in a video I'm talking about
this week so I saw it and I was like I
love you because I used to use it a lot
I'm just gonna blend this stuff out with
the duo fiber okay for highlighter i'm
using my becca highlighter in a
moonstone I've been really enjoying this
packaging is quite hideous but I like it
the product that is
so just apply it it's like it's like a
great highlighter for day to day cuz
it's really not too much at all now
we're gonna do brows I'm just going to
do my brows and come back because it
does take me quite a minute to do my
brows so I'll be right back okay so for
liner I'm going to use L'Oreal carbon
black linear intense and the Kat Von D
liner and just gonna do a traditional
winged liner okay so I've got my liquid
liner on the thing with that look that I
did in my FIF video I hope I'm in focus
with that FIF video excuse me man I
actually had a pretty thick liner and it
had lashes on so that really made a
difference with the look but I'm gonna
go ahead and line my upper and lower
waterline with this NARS eyeliner in the
imminent oh okay now to finish up the
eye shadow going to take a little bit of
saddle one last time and just blend this
into the crease I'm a huge blending
person but I don't feel like it's
blended how I want it I'll go back and
they'll blend blend blend blend blend
until I'm completely satisfied take this
brush this is a sigma domed utility
brush and I'm gonna go in with this
shade which is Brun there I'm going to
put this on the outer V tap off any
excess apply that right on the outer
half flip it into the crease just so it
doesn't look choppy or any shape I'm
going to take an EU 25 and blend that
out and I'm gonna blend this too much
into the crease because it still won't
Brown script to show because yeah I'm
not going like all the way into the
crease I'm just kind of keeping it out
of here I'm blending it out
you
and I'm just going to go back in with
that original shade the amber lights
amber lights why do I keep calling it
Amber rush is there something called
amber Tasha just came off my mine so I'm
taking amber lights again I'm just going
to touch up the inner part of my eye
just to make sure it really pops I love
that eye shadow okay for today's
highlight shade I'm gonna take Sigma's
eyeshadow in elope this is a nice matte
cream shade my favorite to highlight
with tap off any excess I'm putting this
under the brow mainly focusing it right
underneath the arch just to kind of lift
it up a bit so focus it on the arch and
then I kind of drag it out underneath
the rest of the brow now I'm going to
put some mascara on you could put any
much scare on I'm using my favorite pair
of lashes I've just been really loving
lately it's the art Dell I got the multi
pack from Sally's it was $15 which is
ridiculous but I paid it anyways and I
got the demi whispies and these are
awesome I love them they are super light
they're not hard to apply which I love
so I'm going to apply these bad boys and
I'll be right back okay false lashes are
on and now I'm going to smoke out the
bottom lash line a little bit I'm gonna
take a pencil brush and the color I'm
going to use is Swiss chocolate from my
Mac palette where's the beaten-up one
there they're all beaten up they look
like crap
you
okay now I'm gonna put mascara on my
bottom lashes and the last thing to do
is lips and I'm going to be using
favorite lip combo so I'm gonna use my
Revlon Colorstay lip pencil in nude
which is my new favorite for a month and
a half two months now then going in with
one of my favorite drugstore lipsticks
this is wet and wild
Fergie daily and this is also the lip
coma I did use in that video top it off
I'm taking my Mac Fleur abundance lip
glass so I hope you guys enjoyed this
