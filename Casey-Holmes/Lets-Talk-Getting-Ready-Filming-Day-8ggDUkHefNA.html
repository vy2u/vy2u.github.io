another getting ready video I got a lot
of positive feedback from my last
getting ready video and I was like you
know I'll do it again because there was
so much positive feedback thank you guys
so much for all the nice things you said
too by the way um so I was figuring I
have to film today so I might as well do
another getting ready video and this
time I'm using more high-end products I
mean the guy can get started huh clip my
hair back I did curl my hair with my new
me one inch clipless curling wand okay
so today I'm actually going to be
finishing up this and well this is the
makeup for ever matte velvet plus
foundation and I have this big light in
front of me something like blinded but
and this is in number 40 and I just want
to use this up because I have just like
a little bit left I don't know if you
can see because that light but um I have
a little bit left so I'm gonna take this
Sigma F 88 brush I love this brush for
foundation it's one of my favorites and
I'm just going to put this all over my
face I think this is the foundation I'm
gonna get the full size up cuz I think
it's gonna be great for winter so this
might be the one I get lot C I just love
like I said in one of my other videos
you can just totally tell the difference
between high-end foundations and
drugstore foundations like when they're
on your skin it's just it's insane how
different they are
and if I'm a little different or if I
cough a lot or something I am getting
kind of sick
I like rarely get sick but ever since I
started dating Colton every time he gets
sick he like passes it on to me so now
I'm going to take this dermablend
concealer this isn't stable you've seen
this so many times in my videos because
I use it literally all the time apply a
little bit of this on my cheeks just a
tiny bit cover up any extra redness pick
through using that same brush just going
to put that achieve some blended out I
just love this foundation it looks so
nice you guys we haven't tried the Make
Up For Ever matte velvet plushy ship
because it's really nice peleg little
toothpaste on ìlet sorry and in the
camera it looks Arden the viewfinder
doesn't look like my neck matches my
face but I think it's just a lighting
because it does match but bronzer will
help that going to do my under-eye
concealer I use this all the time the
Rimmel match perfection concealer and
light I'm gonna use this today and I
love this stuff I love it it's so good
so placing that underneath my eyes a
little bit of triangle good blend up my
fingers
under-eye concealer is on just going to
blend a little bit like with the tip of
this brush and then I'm gonna take of
course the Make Up For Ever HD powder
love this stuff
a lot of your tongue maybe I won't be
using that because I really don't feel
like getting that the left emotional
brilliance powder haven't used this in
forever so that's what it looks like
showed in a hall or I didn't show it all
because I didn't get it in my bag but
I'm gonna be using this to set my under
eye concealer and also just go ahead and
set my face stuff go take it and Pat
away oh crap I just like poured a
buttload that's the only thing I hate
this does not have a sifter at all so
it's one of those things that just
pisses you off when you try to work with
it maybe that's why I haven't used it so
long peg powder brush and I'm just going
to put this all over this is a great
matte powder if it had a sifter it'd be
perfect and if you have the makeup
forever powder does anyone else think it
smells weird I think it smells kind of
weird I might be the only one but it
smells weird okay I'm going to take my
Chanel seletun a Chanel bronzer is what
it looks like and there's the back case
you're wondering about names and stuff
this is what looks like it's like a
cream bronzer but if you have oily skin
I've said this before don't be scared of
it because it's not going to like be
super creamy on you but this sort of
goes on and it sort of dries to a powder
it doesn't look like a cream at all it's
very natural very very pretty for this
bronzer i'm using this crown brush
contour breath will art contour blush
whatever i'm gonna use it for bronzer a
little bit of this stuff does go a long
way so every time I swirl my brush and
the product I will tap off excess and
then I'll just start applying it where I
would usually like apply
contour buzzing you're so red you guys
see that um
the ALP is where I usually apply my
contour so right here and I'll just drag
it up the side of my face and go to the
top of my forehead and it's just a
really nice natural bronzer like I'm
obsessed with it can you tell the
difference
I love it so again tap off excess and
just kind of contour with it okay now
I'm just going to kind of buff out that
contour just so it doesn't look too
harsh with this crown brush brush I
don't know what it's called doesn't have
a name on it but it was like a big
breath roll brush you can use any sort
of big dense brush and it'll work fine
so there we go that's better right yep
okay and I'm gonna go ahead and do blush
and for today's blush I'm going to be
using the NARS day in Moorea palette
this is sin it's one of my favorite
colors from NARS I'm obsessed with it so
this is the color I'll be using and I'm
just going to apply that on my cheeks
this is one of the colors that I would
go out and buy the full size of because
I love it so much especially for fall
and winter it's really pretty
okay now for eyes I'm gonna zoom you
guys in okay so I'm going to take soft
ochre and Mac going to prime my eyes and
I have it for Mac's shades that I'm
gonna be using today I'll go ahead and
show you them um we have Omega saddle
which I used to talk about all the time
got expresso and antiqued which is a
really pretty color especially for a
fall so those are the Paris colors I'm
using today and the first one I'm going
to take is saddle from Mac I'm gonna
take a blending brush
and just uh put this in my crease like a
transition color oh you guys diseases
okay and then we're going to take
antiqued so we're just going to take a
flat shader brush that counts like that
this is a sigma e55 and we're going to
take antiqued chisel of pillar and i'm
gonna apply this sort of from the middle
of my eye to the outer part to the outer
v so just sort it in the middle you know
applied all the razzle will do so apply
this color kind of lightly all over the
lid I always end up changing my mind
like right when I'm doing something then
I'm gonna take an angled brush like this
nice Bush taking expresso from Mac I
take that angle brush and just deepen
out that or V then we want to blend
blend I know I keep looking the
viewfinder but I'm trying trying to see
if I'm in here I think if you guys can
see what I'm doing because last time you
guys really wanted me to zoom in more
I'm not gonna zoom in really closely I'm
like when I do face products because I
kind of feel like that's pointless but
everything else like eyes and stuff I'll
zoom in on so it looks like I'm gonna
take just a little bit of Omega okay so
just a little bit over Omega and I'm
just gonna kind of take this right above
where saddle ends really quickly gonna
take brulée from line wild see this is
like one of those videos that you just
do it as you go but I like those kinds
of videos right so this is Brule it's a
nice matte cream color from wet and wild
and with this right underneath my brow
this is a gorgeous highlight great for
drugstore when while is so pigmented and
it's definitely worth trying out if
you've never tried them before putting
this in my inner corner it's more like
the inner part of the lid too
to brighten it up some alright and now
we're going to take the L'Oreal hip
liner talk about this a lot so it looks
like going to line my waterline now
taking my favorite liquid liner this is
the Rimmel exaggerate liner that's what
it looks like I've been completely
obsessed of it and of course what am I
gonna do I'm gonna do a winged liner so
really quickly going to take this pencil
brush taking expresso from AK gonna
smudge this underneath my bottom lash
line then we're gonna curl our lashes
and apply some mascara I'll have a nice
carotene video up soon if I don't have
it up now but have it up now I'll link
it in this video because there's no
point you seen me do my mascara if I've
already done a video on it so oh okay oh
these are the finished eyes your nice
simple kind of smokey but that's what I
like for lipgloss I'm just going to use
NYX sugar pie it's just a nice nude
color
and that is it so I hope you guys enjoy
this little gang ready video if there is
the finished face I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I know I probably
didn't talk as much because I was like
concentrating on stuff I needed I was
wanting to do for makeup but I hope you
guys enjoyed this and I will see you all
in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
