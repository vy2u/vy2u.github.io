a let's talk getting ready video this is
kind of a new video I'm gonna try doing
and if you do like them then please let
me know and I will continue to do stuff
like this I am using like a new bronzer
today and I'm not doing too crazy but
I'm going to show you guys my favorite
fall palette I really wanted to do this
video to show you guys that the first
thing I'm going to do is apply my
favorite foundation at the moment this
is the Revlon Colorstay and medium beige
since I'm not really self-tanning a lot
lately I'm kind of like so I need to
step up my game and now that we are in
HD you can really see that my skin is
very red and it's very not perfect so
for all youth out there who think I
don't need makeup or something that even
out my skin tone I do and so I'm just
taking the foundation with the Sigma f80
8 brush and we apply this all over my
face I think I'm gonna start looking for
a high-end foundation just to have
because I do I like the way high-end
Foundation's make my skin look and how
flawless they make them look and
everything but this is a great drugstore
foundation I've said that before it's
really great but I'm gonna do comparing
the wit and the liquid very very soon um
I kind of have an idea on what I like
and what I don't like and which one's
better and all that so I'll be showing
you guys that very very soon ok so that
foundation did pretty good job at
evening out my skin tone but I still see
redness being fair so I'm taking the
dermablend concealer and sable I'm gonna
apply this on my redness I got
completely hounded in my video where I
just used this concealer and powder the
whole point of that video was to show
you guys what I use when I don't wear a
foundation that's how I get a nice
finish my even skin tone without
foundation um and I use this concealer
and I got a whole lotta you just should
use foundation because you used it all
of your face I really only
apply it right here in my cheeks where
it's really really red and then like if
I have any acne which I had some on my
forehead and I of course put some up
there but I have to blend it out you
know what I mean so it looks like I'm
gonna apply it all over my face but I
don't know it's personal preference I
wasn't trying to get a rise out of any
of you like I did I didn't expect it to
be as big of a deal as people made it
but the whole point of that video was
just to show you guys what I do when
don't wear foundation so that's all I
didn't like it I know a lot of you
didn't um but it's just what I do so I
liked it I haven't really been using my
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
because it's just so expensive and I
don't feel like using it up so I'm just
going to take this one by remov and
using it pretty much every day and I'm
just going to apply this underneath my
eyes triangle motion a lot of people
asked why I applied this so heavy in
that video this is not a heavy concealer
at all and it's a really kind of sheer
concealer - it's not really full
coverage at all it just brightens up
underneath your eyes is what it really
does I just apply in the triangle motion
because it's just my preference I like
it that way I swear I got hounded in
that video completely completely hounded
but it's okay everybody has their own
opinion but I felt like I would address
why I used concealer in that video okay
so now that we got our concealer on I'm
gonna take the Makeup Forever HD powder
put that right where I put any concealer
this powder is so great at just setting
your concealer it makes it matte you
should have a nice little flawless
finish
I think I'm just gonna place all over my
face so I'm gonna take a big cutter
brush - oh I have one right here I keep
forgetting our brushes right here
and I'm just going to kind of put this
all over so just Matt it's nice to get
Sloat this one okay so I'll finish my
face later but we go ahead and put eyes
I'm using my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
a lot of you asked me if I liked panel
II never tried perrolli soft ochre was
what the guy gave me at Mac like a year
and a half ago when I pop this and I've
loved it it's just a really great Paint
Pot like the primer it just it's just
perfect
he's my colors on all day and it creates
a really nice base for me so I love it
okay so my favorite favorite palette at
the moment especially for fall I think
it's just such a great palette is the
Maybelline eye studio limited edition
Palaces limited edition it's out right
now
this is in cozy cashmere so this is what
it looks like it's such a gorgeous
palette I'm obsessed with it the colors
are so pigmented and the colors are just
perfect for fall I'm obsessed with this
I'm going to show you kind of a darker
look that I would use for this and if
you guys are interested in seeing like
an everyday what would be a great
everyday fall look that's nice and kind
of light but really pretty let me know
and I'll do that too
but I'm just gonna take the large shader
brush and I'm gonna take that little
champagne kind of color I'm gonna apply
this one all over my lid see just one
swipe and it is so pigmented she's loved
it
so all over the lid and I'm also gonna
put some underneath my brow now I'm
going to take just a fluffy brush
whatever blending blush brush you want
to use I'm gonna take this like plummy
color right there on the end and I'm
gonna put this in my crease and do it
really lightly too you could totally
just build this color up so I'm just
lightly going to blend this in my crease
just kind of doing swell emotions and
work on my way in just like that so now
I'm gonna take just an angled shadow
brush I'm gonna take this color it's
like a dark brown color with I don't
know specs of what would you call it I
don't know if I'm taking this one and
I'm putting this in the outer V very
lightly so just like that and I'm going
to kind of just work it right there and
that outer V just to deepen it up you
don't want to take it in too far
so
just like that and then I'm just gonna
take that same blending brush that I use
I'm just gonna sort of blend that color
a little bit so it's not super super
harsh okay now I'm going to take this
color it's like a orange a burnt orange
color I guess you could say right - yeah
so I'm going to take a pencil brush put
it in that orange putting this
underneath my lower lashes and I'm just
going to kind of connect it also to this
little way to that B so now I'm just
taking it under this has a nice pop of
color I like it
so put that underneath just to sort of
smoke it out get that blending brush
just kind of blend a little bit hey so
now I'm just going to line my eyes this
has been my favorite liner for the month
I didn't like it at first but once I
started using it I was like oh my gosh I
love it so much it's just on my favorite
so I'm gonna show you up close this is
the Rimmel exaggerate liner is there a
felt tip liner but it's literally one of
the best ones ever it's so black it's
just the bomb I don't know if you guys
can see that but so I'm just gonna do a
winged liner because it's like my
favorite thing ever I always do it okay
okay now I'm gonna take my favorite
pencil liner of the moment this is the
L'Oreal hip liner this is what looks
like just a regular liner you know
whatever works for you plan it to my
waterline
I have a trio of my Sierra's that I love
but I literally lost a mascara like it
just disappeared from a makeup
collection I don't know where it went
but it's the l'oreal collagen mascara
it's like the all black tube like it's
completely black and then i use the
covergirl LashBlast volume and in the
lash perfection with it but since i
don't have it i'm gonna use them in the
same way I would have used with the
other mascara I'm just gonna use the
turbo and replace the back though
I'm gonna just curl my lashes and apply
some mascara okay so now that you've
done that I'm going to just kind of blot
my face again this is the Maybelline
Dream matte powder
I'm obsessed obsessed with this I'm
going to buy a new one soon I'm running
out so I'm just going to apply this on
my face and I'm actually going to be
using a new bronzer today it's from
Revlon I don't know if you guys have
tried it before but it's the Revlon
Photoready bronzed and
that's what it looks like I feel like
I've tried this before I feel like if
the bronzer will be a lot better if it
didn't have like this color because this
color kind of makes everything look very
orange but I kind of focus my brush down
here on the lower half so I'm gonna take
my brush focus it in there just going to
kind of put this where I put a contour
still I like this bronzer for everyday
use and I'm just going to blend really
quickly
then I'm applying one of my favorite
blushes at the moment this is RHIB
rimmel's lasting finish blush and spring
flower this you could also use instead
of like using a contour or something
because it's so pretty and this color
kind of acts as a contour shade but I'm
gonna use it because I love it so just
playing this on my cheeks a lot of
people say this isn't really pigmented
but if you'd like a darker skin tone I
wouldn't say it's gonna show up very
well on you but if you could have like a
lot of your skin or something like that
you would really like this I think it's
really great and I've used it a lot um
my crowns starting to go away on it so I
love it and then I'm just going to top
everything off with a lip gloss it had
somebody asked me why I don't wear lip
products a lot and that's because it's
just not a priority for me so I'm just
going to take this NYX lip gloss and
sugarpie I just dropped a long chair and
I'm going to apply that eyelids just to
give some shine and that's pretty much
it I love this palette so much if you
haven't picked it up you really should
because I feel like you will be upset
with it so hope you guys enjoyed this
video like it if you liked it and I will
see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
