talk getting ready video in a very long
time so I figured I would do one today
my mom got me this new Mac palette
yesterday it's super cute it's the
quilted top with the bow from the newest
collections
this one's called fabulousness 5at smoky
eyes I do believe or smokey eye and
these are the colors so they're just
more of that purple toned kind of
shadows and they're really pretty so I
figured I do a getting ready video with
them today so let's get started of
course I'm using my foundation Make Up
For Ever foundation in number 35 I love
this stuff so you can kind of see now
today um how it applies on my skin it's
probably gonna be a little too dark for
me because I didn't want to self-tans
for this video I'm probably gonna self
teen after so it might be a little bit
dark but it'll match me afterwards so
I'm just gonna apply some applying with
theme f82 from Sigma cuz all my other
brushes are completely completely dirty
so just going to put this all over
I have some new products coming in the
middle tomorrow and then I have to fill
a hall um Thursday so be on the lookout
for that video because I'm gonna have a
bunch of new things and I'm asking you
if you want first impressions on
anything and then I think probably at
the end of the month I'll do another
video that's gonna be completely
dedicated to the FIF so that month so
I'll update you on how I feel about the
products I used throughout the month and
all of that so that will be like not in
a favorites video but it'll be just
another video for the end of the month
for my channel so I'll update you guys
on how I still feel about the products
and all that stuff that's exciting
I'm loving if I have so far and I've got
quite a few bit of products to try out
so that's awesome and there you have it
so that's the foundation part I love
this foundation taking the Rimmel match
perfection concealer and light trying to
use this baby up so I've been using this
a lot more lately just gonna apply this
underneath my eyes and I'm getting close
to being done with it but it's still
taking me forever like this could see
other last a hot minute so it's like a
baby right now but I'm just gonna Pat it
in I still love this concealer though
you know just when you use products
you're ready to use them up that's how I
am right now because I have my mainly
insta Adrienne Y rewind which I love but
I just I need to use some of this stuff
up cuz I word a bunch of things and I
don't want to like miss out on any of my
stuff I've been using and this has been
my new favorite brush to like blend out
concealer like either down here or just
Pat it in this is the f-86 tapered
kabuki from Sigma I love this awful nice
so I could just like put it where I want
with my fingers
take this brush and just Pat it in and
it blends it perfectly so I love it
um you know makeup forever standing
powder got it use this baby I'm gonna
take that same brush I'm gonna set my
under eye first and then I'm gonna go in
with my bigger powder brush and just put
it all over my face
I've been using this powder up like
crazy like I barely have any product
left look at this but look at the bottom
like that's how much product I have left
I've been using it up so I did order
another powder not this one but I order
a different one
but I might end up ordering this one
again because I love it to set my
foundation with so now we're going to
contour hoola benefits bronzer it is rat
chia I had the sample of it taking this
at 25 and I'm just going to contour my
face okay so now we're done bronzing I'm
going to use one of my favorite blushes
I just kind of went back into since it
is getting to be the colder months so
this is my NARS dannemora pal I got last
Christmas and I'm taking today which is
one of my favorite colors for it's the
winter time for blushes it's just this
really pretty sort of purple color as
you can see just going to pop this on my
cheeks
kind of prime Matt Picht pot soft ocher
per usual so again this is the palette
from Mac blue I got powder all over it
already
this thing is gonna get a super dirty I
can retell but I'm gonna go in with this
lighter shade on the end and let apply
this all over my lid
this is such a like pretty color I don't
think the camera is picking up hell it's
like a purpley pink tone like it's a
pink with a purple undertone it's really
pretty more of like a lavender I'd say
it's gorgeous gorgeous which course
going in with a color right next to it
I'm going to take a fluffy crease brush
and I'm going to take that one put it in
my crease
then going in with which one do I want
I'll go on with this color right here
playing this on my outer-v
it's like my favorite way to apply my
makeup nowadays just a crease color like
color out of the way I'm done you wanna
me
take a fluffy blending brush you know
the drill
blend Lublin
gonna take this kind of darker color
right here going to make this no I'm
going to put this sort of like right
here so it's sort of on the lid but kind
of transitioning into that outer V part
I'm just gonna put a little bit there so
you kind of a gradual effect
now I'm going to take this like a violet
to color which is really pretty actually
views out all my lid one day but this
one right here I'm gonna line my lower
lashline with this it's gonna be like my
pop of color or pop up even more color
and apply it under there my eyebrows
look hideous please don't mind them
so that's it for this pallet really cute
I like the colors together your
pigmentation is really great so of
course a win for me
I'm taking my favorite liner of the
moment this is a maybelline line
stiletto liner look like that going to
do a winged liner per usual
I think what liner like when I was
younger I used to wear a lot of black
makeup because I went through this
little stage but I used to wear a lot of
liner like black liners and stuff like
that and I think that's how I learned to
do liner so well because I used to do it
a lot like intense and then I died down
and learned how to do it normal so I
think that's how I learned so well it
wasn't just like one day I did a random
leave liner and it was perfect mine was
more of I did way too much makeup and I
toned it down and that's how I learned
I'm gonna take Mac smolder liner ow
which needs to be sharpened I can't find
my other like L'Oreal hip one like went
missing in a day taking the covergirl
clump crusher mascara me likey this a
lot and I'm just going to apply a little
bit of that on my lashes these colors
are really pretty I'm really liking this
eye shadow usually I'm not a purple fan
but I'm really loving this one
I'm gonna apply my lip stuff now I'm
applying the Rimmel lasting finish lip
liner this is in natural I've been using
this a lot lately and I mention it in my
November favorites I love this taking
max creme de nude I love this lipstick
it's so good
thump eyes all over Pat it then taking
Revlon's peach petal gloss again patting
this one too and that's pretty much it
