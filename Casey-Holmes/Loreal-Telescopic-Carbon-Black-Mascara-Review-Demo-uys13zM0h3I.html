on my new favorite mascara and it is the
L'Oreal telescopic carbon black mascara
I love this I picked it up from the
drugstore I say a couple weeks ago and
I've been using it ever since it's the
only mascara I've been using and I
really love it I saw Carli bybel use
this like all the time in her videos she
swears by it so I just decided to go
pick it up and I absolutely loved it now
I have to tell you when I saw the brush
this is what looks like the brush kind
of scared me because it is so tiny but
that's what it makes your lashes like
seriously because it's so tiny it gets
right to the root and you can just lift
it up and it really helps like make your
lashes longer and they also separate
very well but then like I'll show you in
the video I apply one application and
it's really great at lengthening and
separating but when I apply my second
application it's really great at
creating volume as well so if you like
to see a demo on this mascara then just
keep watching okay so I'm going to show
you guys the difference that this
mascara makes it's so amazing so I'm
just going to go ahead and just start
applying it this is just so you guys can
see what it does on its own without any
help
I mean I'm obsessed with this mascara
just see how long it makes your lashes
and how it curves them up so that is my
one application you can see it just
makes it really nice and the lashes are
really long and I just love it it's so
awesome so I'm just going to do another
application and as you can see this wand
is super tiny so it's really easy just
to get right up to the root of the lash
and just wiggle it up and then your
lashes just like are up and out and it
makes your eyes look more awake so I'm
going to do one more application
okay so that is the second application
for the top lashes I just love it so
much I usually will stop if I'm doing
everyday kind of makeup I'll stop with
lactation but if I've any false lashes
or anything like that I will always do
two applications and I'll show you
really quickly on the bottom lashes the
bottom lashes I don't really like this
mascara port I mean I do but you have to
be careful because sometimes it can
apply too much product and they get
clumpy really really easily so I just
I'm very careful with the bottom lashes
okay so as you guys can see it really
made my lashes very long dramatic and I
love using this mascara I want to use my
half lashes because it just works so
well with the half lashes and they just
blend in beautifully this mascara also
holds its curl all day long like my
eyelashes never fall down or anything
like that they stay nice and up and make
my eyes just look more awake and that's
why I really love this mascara I feel
like it's totally worth the money it's
my new favorite now I haven't touched
any other mascara since I purchased this
one because it's just been my go-to and
I love it so if you have been debating
on getting this I definitely recommend
picking it up let me know what your
favorite mascaras are down below if you
have this one let me know how you like
it and thank you guys so much for
watching don't forget to like the video
if you would like more kind of not first
impressions but more product reviews and
demos and I will see you guys next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
