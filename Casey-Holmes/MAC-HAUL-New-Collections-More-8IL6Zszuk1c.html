freaking me out what are you doing what
that was violent excuse me
I'm sorry you're not tall enough didn't
boo what she might not like to em hey
guys so today's video is going to be a
Mac hall and I've purchased quite a bit
of stuff from them the past couple weeks
I'm telling you I'm on a Mac kick I've
been on the Mac kick ever since I went
to IMAX like what a couple months ago a
few months ago it's been a while some
for some reason that has my heart lately
so I did pick up a few things from newer
collections and just things that I
wanted to pick up in general so I asked
you guys last week on Twitter if you
want to see a haul and you guys are like
duh if you want to know what makeup I'm
wearing i will leave it all in the
description box below the eye look is
really similar to the prom mat makeup
look that I did and then this is just
lady danger and this whitening
lightening lip gloss in Summer Sun which
I do have coupon codes for this if you
want check that out the description box
so let's go ahead and jump into
these products have literally been
sitting here for like a week and it's
been killing me I'm not gonna lie though
I've dabbled into him so the first thing
I got was a snack a prep and prime
moisture infusion serum and I was
watching I don't remember her name but
she is really really knowledgeable with
Mac and she had mentioned this and I was
like this sounds so intriguing to me I'm
all about moisture even though I do have
oily skin I do look for a lot of
products that have a lot of
certain them but since this is a serum I
figured I would go ahead and get it for
the daytime I want to try this out the
bottle is absolutely adorable it's just
a gray a glitter bottle and I have used
this a couple times and I'm really
loving it my face
I've been putting high SPF on my face
and reapplying it over the weekends
while I've been out at the pool in my
face always gets burnt I don't know what
is wrong and then when I have the
rosacea involved with it it's just like
I look like a tomato face and then the
rest of my body is just like tan it's
been hard because my skin's been really
dry from so much sun exposure so this
has really helped to bring some moisture
back into my skin and so when I do apply
my foundation and concealer and
everything like that it doesn't look
patchy or flaky and then this was
actually a recommendation from one of my
subscribers in the comments I can't
remember what video it was but she had
said that she worked at Mac and the
vibrancy eye primer was getting
discontinued and she recommend this one
which is the fast response eye cream and
I've never tried this before but so far
I've been loving a lot of Mac skin care
so I figured I would try this out that
you guys know what I thought of it
moving on to collections I did get 5
things from the Mac alluring Aquatics
collection I was really pumped about
this collection but when I actually went
to swatch everything and got some stuff
off the Nordstrom I was a little bit
taken back I feel like I'd ever could
turn another bronzer just because it was
super light but I will just go ahead and
show you guys what I got
so the first thing is the thing that I
wanted and no matter what if I didn't
get anything from this collection I
wanted this lipstick as a lipstick and
enchanted one this is a matte nude it is
a pinky nude as well as you can see it's
a little bit darker but that's what I
love about it you guys know I've been
really into these darker nudes and not
so much the lighter nudes like creme de
nude or Miss I don't even own a Miss
just because I feel like it's a little
too new for me but this one is beautiful
and literally my my new lip combo has
been the Mac stripped down this lipstick
and then the whitening lightning gloss
in nude or whatever nude gloss I want to
wear for the day but it's usually that
one to be honest with you that's usually
my lip coming out and I love it's just a
nice
juicy darker nude and then the next
thing I was actually really excited
about this is a lipgloss in peach stock
and yep this is my favorite it's just a
gorgeous peachy nude again it's not too
light at all it is so beautiful this is
everything I wanna look gloss so I've
been wearing this a lot too with that
lipstick and stripped down from Mac okay
moving on to bronzers I did get the
refined golden I also got golden but it
was so light like it blended into my
skin so I decided to stick with refined
golden and this is a bronzer with some
gold Sheen into it and when I put it on
the skin it's like you see the shimmer I
don't know but it's not too intense I
haven't been able to play with this much
it's a little bit more on the orange
side but it's not as orange as an
excellent about to show you but I'm
always kind of cautious about bronzing
with glitter in the bronzer so I
definitely want to try it out though I
do know this is a permanent shade and I
just want to see how I like it it's
really creamy and smooth which is
another thing that I love about Mac then
the other bronzer that I got is this Mac
extra dimension bronzer in Delphic so
this one does have a little bit of
shimmer in it there it is right there I
do like this one a lot it comes out a
lot more pigmented than I expected at
least a little bit better than the blush
if you like but I really like this color
a lot and again I'm just gonna have to
experiment with it and see how I like it
it is really beautiful but I just kind
of I'm always iffy about bronzers with
some shimmer and I know a lot of people
were disappointed with the blushes in
the collection but I actually liked them
even though this one's more of a mauve
color I still really liked it I thought
it was super pretty I did with the other
one more than this one but I figured hey
I would pick this one up
so this one is see me hear me it's not
as pigmented as I would like I feel like
I really have to build up the color but
it's just a gorgeous Bobbi pink colors
it's actually really really nice so I'm
excited to wear this one I'll probably
wear it more in the winter time but I
think it's really gorgeous I'll probably
even pop it on you know for the summer
time as well with like a really nice tan
Mac Pro Longwear lipliner in high energy
and this is a lipliner that I'm wearing
right now with the lady danger lipstick
and it's just a gorgeous red with like
an orange undertone so pretty when I
swatch this on my hand the other day and
went to wipe off all the makeup
everything came off other than this lip
liner like it stay to put for a really
long time so I love these problem where
lip liners I think they are totally
worth the money another lip liner that I
got this is actually one that I
mentioned stripped down in my may
favorites and I said I feel like it was
a really Kylie Jenner color but when I
said that a lot of you in comments let
me know that she actually uses world for
Mac so I figured I would give it a whirl
and picture the hub and this is just a
four just kind of I think it's a mommy
nude last time i swatched it yeah it's
like a mommy taupe nude like very ashy
but it's it's really pretty it goes
along with enchanted one really nicely I
think it would be a really great combo
so I decided to pick that up because
Kylie Jenner wears it and the last thing
I got was this Mac Pro Longwear eyeliner
in black and I wanted to pick this up
because I have you smolder before I
didn't really like smolder just because
it will just kind of smear off and kind
of get out of here and the edges of your
eye but I have heard that this is
actually really great before if you have
watery eyes and things like that so I
definitely want to give it a go it is
super creamy so I'm very excited to try
this out I want to see if they will top
my NARS one which the NARS one is pretty
much the best one I've ever found
so hopefully this can be a little bit
more comparable to that as well it get
two brushes I would purchase the mac 242
because I could not find this in my
collection the other day when I was
doing the copper and blue makeup look I
wanted to use this brush and I couldn't
find it anywhere so I decided to pick it
up again because I do love this brush
for pigments it's just so easy to apply
them and it doesn't like to make the
pigment go everywhere then they also got
this Mac brush in the number 211 this
actually reminds me of the Sigma e o
fives and it's just really nice it's a
little bit shorter than the Sigma ones
and not as thick and it has a lot of
flexibility to it so I plan on using
this for eyeliner I'm really excited
about it because it is a little bit
shorter so you're gonna have a little
bit more control and I've never
this brush so I'm excited to try it out
if you guys have been seeing my recent
tutorials lately I've done a close-up on
my Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre you can
tell that I'm hitting the brim it's
about to die so I decided to get a
backup of my soft ochre Paint Pot which
is personally my favorite if you are
going to get started with makeup I
definitely think an eye primer is
essential and I think it's good to spend
a little bit extra money on a good I
prime err this one is perfect it evens
out the lids and it just leaves like a
really nice canvas for any eyeshadow
when put on top now I have had a lot of
people ask me why I use two different
primers and the NARS one is really
awesome if you have oily eyelids so I
like to apply that one down first but it
doesn't have any color to it so that's
why I go in with my Mac Paint Pot in
soft ochre on top and just do a light
layer to even out the lid I've noticed
that if I just use this paint pot it
will crease on my eyes because my
eyelids are so oily so that is why I use
two primers and I have not had any
issues since using those two together my
eyeshadow lasts all day
and does not crease so if you are having
a really hard time with that I would
definitely recommend that combo because
I swear by them okay so I did get two
eyeshadows the first one I got is deep
damson I have had my eye on this little
beauty for such a long time and I
figured I would go ahead and pick it up
now it's just a gorgeous deep plum color
and I figured for a smoky eye this will
be so gorgeous I love this deep plum I
swear every time I saw somebody use it I
was like yes I need this in my life I
also got to the eyeshadow in kid and it
is a really pretty eye shadow
let me see it's really light it's like a
nude shade with just a some taupe in it
so it's not like soft brown it's not
really warm or anything like that it's
more on the cool side and I just wanted
to try it out okay I'm gonna show you
guys z2 waterproof brow products that I
got so they came out with the fluid line
brow gel creams which are waterproof and
also the pro long wear waterproof brow
set which is like the arm Estancia brow
gels but this is waterproof and I want
try it out so this is the color quiet
brunette and I really like this color
because it's not too dark of a brown
it's just that perfect middle shade so
that is what it looks like right there
really excited to try this out has great
color payoff and I like the fact that
the one is a little bit shorter so it's
easy just to get all of the hairs and
you know not like get it up on your
forehead and by accident because stuff
happens and then for the fluid line I
got the color deep dark brunette which I
figured this would be the best match for
me if anything that is too dark I'll
just use a really light hand with it but
that's what it looks like right there it
looks a little bit darker on camera but
in person is more of like a chocolate
brown it's really really pretty and it's
not too dark so that's the color that I
got and I will definitely let you guys
know what I think of it the last two
products I got were lip glasses
the first one is pur and I don't know I
was just searching the site and I saw
this color and I was like why do I not
have this in my life it's a very unique
color I do not have anything like this
it's like a peachy pink with like a gold
Sheen in there it's a very very very
fine glitter but it is really gorgeous
so I wanted to pick this up because I
love shades like this and I knew this
would be right up my alley and then the
last one I got this one's really pretty
this is a color razzle dazzle err and
let's see this is a really gorgeous like
muted pink this is like the perfect
everyday lip color it's not too pink but
it's not too light it's not too dark
it's a perfect in-between shade and I
just love it and this thing is really
really pigmented like that's just one
swipe right there gorgeous so again this
one is razzle dazzle err okay guys so
that is it for my Mac haul I hope you
