today I'm bringing you an exciting video
I asked you on snapchat if you do want
to see this and a lot of you said yes so
I figured I would do a full video
dedicated to the Mariah Carey and Mac
cult this is not Mariah Carey Matt
calebrage I figured I would do a V on
the Mariah Carey a Mac collaboration
this has to be one of the most beautiful
packaging collaborations that I have
seen from Mac that was a really big fan
of The Nutcracker collection that came
out I loved the packaging of this but
this takes the freaking cake and if I
had a picture Mariah Carey makeup
packaging it would be something like
this very glam sparkly just gorgeous on
this video I'm going to show you guys me
applying the stuff and then I'll let you
know what I like what I don't like you
know what I think you should buy we
probably shouldn't buy and just let you
know my opinions on this collaboration I
don't know if I have all the items but I
have enough I think don't forget to
subscribe I'll have a link down below in
the description box to be the first one
you see in the description box and yeah
if you want to see all these products
then let's just go ahead and get started
so this is the eye shadow quad that she
came out with with Mac it's called I'm
that chick that you like and it has four
eyeshadows in it you can see that this
packaging is a nice like matte gold and
then around the trim right here you have
that gorgeous glitter going around it is
just so beautiful and then it has Mac
Mariah Carey on here and you open it up
and these are the four eyeshadows that
you get now when you look at this at
least when I first looked at it I was
like okay they're all shimmery this one
is more of like a shame when you put it
on your eye though it doesn't look like
a shimmer eyeshadow these two are
definitely on the shimmery side this is
a match and this is a sheen so this one
does have a little glow to it but you
cannot tell when you put it on your eye
looks like a matte eyeshadow and then
this one is a really great matte
eyeshadow as well now be the first one
to tell you I have not been an avid user
of Mac eyeshadows just because I have
found other products that I love that
are either cheaper or just better
quality than the Mac eyeshadows these I
did like they blended really well and
you could create this nice smoky look
with this full palette you can also do
like a light look as well just put this
in
the crease and then this as your
highlight or you could go even more
dramatic put this all over the lid blend
out in the crease with this highlight
with this you know I see this more as a
smoky palette but you can use this on
days where you want like a really soft
look as well you could just throw this
in the crease and this is a highlight I
still feel the same way now as I have
for the past few years where I feel like
Mac eyeshadows now are just a little bit
more dry than what I want they are
really nice and they're pigmented and
they blend really well but I just feel
like there's better things on the market
like you could barely see that one right
there when you put it on your lay that
looks a little better even when you
swatch it it just looks like a chunky
chunky sheer hot mess if that even makes
any sense oh you can see right there
it's chunky it's a little bit sheer I
mean it we on the lid very nicely like a
shadows are just not my favorite now if
you wanted this eyeshadow palette from
the collection I would definitely say
get it with a brush I feel like they
apply really nicely and I love the way
that my eye look turned out it was
really simple easy you know I just did a
quick look with it and everything
blended out really well but would I go
out and buy this palette not necessarily
unless I was a huge Mariah Carey fan and
I just love these kind of eyeshadows or
if you're a really big Mac lover then
you would really like this palette I
feel like now this one right here is a
gorgeous highlight shade I ended up
highlighting my brow with it as you can
see it is just gorgeous and I also ended
up applying it to the tops of my cheeks
because I didn't like another product
which you'll see in a little bit they
also came out with these false lashes I
was going to put them on but they're not
my style as you can tell my lashes I
have one right now are really dramatic I
don't know how much these are I'll have
it on the screen somewhere but these
from eyelure are like think like twelve
to fifteen dollars and they're amazing
they're so thick and fluffy and if I
remember correctly these eyelashes used
to be expensive so I will go with I'll
or lashes instead I'll have everything
linked down below that I'm talking about
if you like natural lashes like this
kind of wispy you would probably really
like this I'm actually going to include
this eyelash set in a giveaway very soon
so stay on the lookout for that next up
is the blush and this is a basic hot
pink blush you can't even really tell on
camera how hot pink this is
is the classic hot pink you think of a
hot pink blush this is it
what is this remind me of it doesn't it
kinda reminds me a pink swim but it's
more of a hot version of it remember
when everybody used to love pink spoon
like let's take a moment to the
beginning of YouTube when we were all
like pink glue pink spoon I remember
everybody loves pink spoon back in the
day but including myself this is
definitely more of a hot pink version of
that so this is called you've got me
feeling it's the powder blush and I love
Mac blushes I think they're amazing they
blend so well they look great on the
cheeks I really do like this color I
didn't think I was gonna like it but
once I blended it out I love the natural
pinky flesh that it gives I think it
looks really gorgeous and it actually
goes with it I look very well so I like
it a lot don't be too intimidated by hot
pink blushes if you use a light hand or
if you use a heavy hand like I do and
you blend it out it does look really
nice and again it has that same matte
kind of gold packaging which i think is
so cute I'm moving on to the thing I did
not like this is the my me me the extra
dimension skin finish and this is what
it looks like I think my thing is I'm
not the biggest fan of extra dimension
skin finishes just because they're not
as pigmented as I want them to be I
don't know I just don't really like
extra dimension skin finishes now this
is a gorgeous like copper color and I
was using it as a highlight when I first
started filming this video looking a
little bit more pigmented now that I'm
likes watching it with my finger that's
it right there I think for darker
complexions this is gonna be gorgeous
gorgeous has a highlight I did have it
on my face as a highlight it just looked
like a warm sun kissed kind of highlight
that makes sense I personally like
lighter highlights and I also tried to
use this as blush topper that was not
working out very well for me so this is
just not something that I would
gravitate towards or spend my money on
just because I don't like the formula
and I don't necessarily like the color I
wouldn't use this color a lot but I feel
like you have tanned deep skin tones
this is gonna look gorgeous on you you
might have to take your brush in there a
little bit to get that color payoff on
your brush but this is gonna look
stunning
on your skin okay the next thing I want
to talk about is this lip liner this is
the lipliner in a so dramatic as they
prolong wear lip liner I love the pro
long wear lip liners from Mac I think
they're amazing they're really really
soft and creamy you can see right there
it's more of like a taupe Brown I really
like it it's gorgeous again really
really creamy has that gorgeous
packaging as well I like this but I
don't like it with a lip color that I
used it with but I do like the lip liner
I think it's worth it if you like this
kind of color you're going to love this
lip liner because it's creamy blends
easily and then moving on to the
lipsticks
oh the packaging of these lipsticks you
guys is just can I have this for
everything
honestly like look at that you pull this
out of your purse somebody is bound to
be like girl what is that to wear the
lipsticks look like you can see that
butterfly detail and it also has her
signature on it as well goes from
lightest than the lightest new to a
darker new so the lightest nude is
called
bits of bubbly the medium toned nude is
called lipstick machism and then the
last one the darker shimmery color is
called I get so oh oh see okay I'm a big
Mariah Carey cam I have no idea what
that means
I get so ooc out of control
I get so out of control maybe I don't
know this is a frost this one is a cream
Sheen and this one's a cream cheese so
you have to cream jeans and a frost I
put the lip liner on first that is in
this collection and then I went on top
of it with lipstick machism and certain
ones called frou
it's just called machism I don't know
then I put this on top and I forgot how
much I don't like cream Sheen formulas
because they're really sheer so it
looked really patchy and you could see
the darker lip liner underneath the
lipstick the color is really really nice
I think they're gorgeous
but if you want more of a full pigment
lipstick I would not go for these
because they are more on the sheer side
and they are glossy as well and the
packaging if I was going to pick one it
would definitely be machism
because this is the kind of color that I
would go for more on a day-to-day basis
I would even use it by itself this time
I'll use a lighter lip pencil Oh can't
onto the lip glosses I have one that I
really liked and honestly I'm not the
biggest glitter lip
Glaus person I love a matte lip you guys
know like with lipsticks are my thing I
love them but I've got a new favorite
pretty sure these are lip glasses you
can see the tops have that glitter
effect to them and these are very very
shimmery the gushed shimmer in them but
okay you can kind of feel them on your
lips as well when you start rubbing them
together this one's in the shade dream
lover this one is my favorite and the
one that I'm going to keep for myself
and then you have two more colors I
think this color is going to be gorgeous
for the summertime like a really intense
bronzed look this one's in the shade
little Miss Monroe and then the other
one is called butterfly bling oh I love
that
those are the shades right there they're
really pretty very sparkly but they are
kind of grainy so if you rub your lips
together you are gonna feel it texture
of these dazzle glasses the grainy
feeling actually doesn't bother me too
much just because there's so much gloss
in it that it kind of takes away from it
feels like more of a cream on my lips
and I don't really focus on rubbing my
lips together and feeling these sparkles
in it so I really like these but if you
don't like that you won't like these the
last thing that I am actually very
impressed with I did that because I put
it on my chest the last thing I want to
talk to you guys about that I actually
love a lot is you touch my body loose
powder again gorgeous gorgeous packaging
and you open it up and you have a puff
and it's like a tinted shimmery powder I
put this on my chest and it just it
doesn't necessarily like look like
shimmer I mean right now yes because
I've put like ten layers on but it makes
your skin just look healthy and glowy
glowy it like gives you that JLo glow
but not needing a lotion you know what I
mean and I really really like it I see
myself uses a ton this holiday season
New Year's summer is no scent to it is a
little bit tinted but I didn't notice it
making my skin look a little bit darker
it just has that golden tint to it so
that is all that I got from the mariah
carey matte collection I am so grateful
that they were able to send this to me
and PR honestly when I got it
I was like oh my gosh see I'm really
grateful they sent it to me of course as
always when I do reviews I'm not going
to shy away from how I feel
and when I think about certain products
so that's why I was honest with you guys
but all in all I do think this is a
great collection and something you
should definitely check out something
that you could have as staples I love
the fact that these are neutrals they're
gorgeous they're shimmery they're glowy
and me this collection screams sexy like
creating a sexy makeup look and like
luscious lips oh the super sparkly lips
to make them look extra glossy and the
shimmery skin the smoky eye is just a
sexy collection and I love that because
when I also think of where I carry I
think of sexy and like touch smell funny
so now I'm gonna go listen to like all
her songs over again and I'm just gonna
go through a cycle you're just going to
go through one of those cycles like I
did with the Selena collection I ended
up listening Selena like for days so
