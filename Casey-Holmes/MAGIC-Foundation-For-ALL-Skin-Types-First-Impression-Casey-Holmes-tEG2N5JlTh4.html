a first impression for you and it's
going to be a a foundation first
impression on the Charlotte Tilbury
magic foundation and I've heard so many
things about this I haven't really
watched any reviews I've watched one
from bunny but I didn't watch like the
final result that she had with it but
I've heard a lot of things about it and
a lot of people told me to pick this up
and try it out for first impression and
I feel like this is such a crazy cool
foundation that I wanted to do a full
video on it by itself because I'm pretty
sure make sure they say this works for
all skin type basically it says it's a
full coverage Demi matte long lasting
foundation enriched with hyaluronic acid
mushroom extract and the concentrated
power of vitamin C says for application
apply for fallish coverage apply with a
magic complexion brush don't have that
Baba so basically it's saying with a
brush nothing about a sponge so we will
try they did send me one and I purchase
one I purchased one from Nordstrom
before I knew that they sent me one I
think the color that they sent me was a
little light but we shall see this is in
one fluid ounce which is normal for a
foundation so I have the shade 6 medium
here don't mind my hair I haven't even
done it yet and then I also have the
shade I don't think the shades are on
the box I think they like call in the
bottle then I have medium 7 I think this
is the one that I purchased so I'm just
going to rip off this packaging and just
see what the packaging is life in the
color first off I do like this packaging
I think it's really pretty and it just
looks really elegant ok so this is the
product you twist it off oh no that's
not what you do you don't twist it off
don't do that pops up it has a pumps so
this is what looks like just pull off
the top and the top doesn't click you
just gotta kind of press down hard to
put the top back on so let's see what
colors we got so again this one is
medium 7 so tone the back of this
product I think I'm going to be medium 7
and I have a Beauty Blender and I also
have a brush many of my artists brush
just to see which way I like to apply it
best and I have applied all my primers
and stuff I applied the benefit
Porefessional
you know Matt rescue the Smashbox primer
water you guys know I just like can't go
a day without this and then it also
applied the soap and glory one heck of a
block primer which is just a mattifying
primer so you can see I'm breaking out
right here
gotta love it so I guess for the first
go-around I'm just going to use a beauty
blender and I'm going to go into medium
seven
so far it looks nice but it doesn't look
like a lot of coverage with the
Beautyblender see you can kind of build
it up maybe it does have a nice finish
it's definitely a doing that and it's
not too mad or anything has a little bit
of a sheen back to the hairline okay so
you can see some iroh's Asia is still
poking through with the Beautyblender
I'm really hoping that the brush covers
it more you can still see my breakout
right here not a fan of that it just
kind of like evened out the color these
birds are loud they need to stop so so
far it's okay it's not like one of my
favorites right now but I'm gonna go
ahead and use my artist brush this is
the Oval eight I'm just going to put
this on like I normally would
mmm no I don't like it with a brush has
even less coverage this is supposed to
be full coverage yeah a full coverage
zooming that what am I doing wrong
this isn't right okay let's try
different brush we'll try this makeup
geek foundation stippling brush sue this
help
I don't really like it right now it's
like I like the finish of it I think it
has a really nice natural finish but I
don't like the coverage I kind of
expected more from it I even think I
would say I like the Beautyblender
better to apply it just because I feel
like it just looks more flawless but you
can see my rosacea is still popping
through see if we can come up with this
Beauty Blender
I do feel like the blender gives it more
coverage a hundred percent and I feel
like I like the finish better with a
Beauty Blender and I do think it is
buildable okay so that's what the
foundation looks like I've built it up
trying to cover my redness and just some
of it is not going away like on my nose
which is like a really big test for a
foundation see it just keeps popping
back up so I'm just going to finish
blending this out and then leave it
alone because it's just not going to be
covered up so I could do like the finish
I like the doing that look I think it
looks more natural but I feel like this
is kind of I don't know like it makes my
pores look a little bit more visible and
I don't really like that and I don't
like the fact that I could still see my
rosacea so that sucks like look you
could see like the texture on my skin
here I don't like that so I'm going to
finish up my makeup and I want to come
back and give you guys an update let you
know what I think after applying
everything and yeah I'll see you in one
second okay so I just finished up my
makeup and I do like the way it looks
after I've put concealer blush
everything like that on everything was
really easy to blend and it wasn't
difficult at all and it doesn't look
cakey on my skin but I do like the way
that it looks I feel like it looks
really flawless it has a nice matte
finish it's not overly drying I still
see a lot of texture here on my cheeks
but then again with these bright lights
things like that really just like show
up you know what I mean so I'm going to
go throughout my day
right now it is 325 you can see it right
there and I'm gonna go run some errands
do my thing and I'll be back to let you
guys know how I feel about this
foundation hopefully I don't have to
blot a lot it is very humid today in
Georgia is nasty it's like the sticky
kind of humidity and it's just not good
oh yeah I will see you guys in just a
few hours hey guys so I am back with an
update
it is currently 618 I did change tops
because let's be real when I go out into
the real world I don't dress up a lot
I'm usually in leggings
and the top this light is just the
thyroids update you guys on this
foundation as you can kind of see oh no
if you can it's a little shiny here in
my t-zone and on my nose and right in
the center of my forehead it's not on my
chin right now because I was eating
something earlier and I got it on my
chin I like ruined my foundation right
here so I had to put a little more on a
little shiny right in here and all I'm
going to do is I'm just going to apply a
little bit more powder I would blot off
the excess oil but I need more blotting
sheets which is why I'm about to
actually go out and run to Ulta so I'm
just going to take a little bit of my
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
just so you guys know I have not even
touched my face with a powder since I
left the house I've just been running
around doing things and eating and but I
have not touched my face at all not even
to blot or anything like that even
though it doesn't have like that super
full coverage finish I was expecting I
do really like the finish of it when I
apply my concealer and all of my other
face products so I feel like if you have
combo skin and you have some dry patches
but you still want to mattifying
foundation I think this would probably
be a good one for you um because it's
not like suck your face dry matte you
know what I'm saying then again I have
not seen any dry skin people try this
but I'm pretty sure this foundation is
supposed to be good for all skin types
let me let me let me see this is what it
says it says that problems can transform
into perfect looking skin before your
very eyes the hyper-intelligent formula
dispenses evenly over your skin it does
not sit in imperfections magic
foundation is a miracle in a bottle that
transformed every skin type into
flawless Wow
every skin type into a flawless poreless
perfection Wow every skin type dry oily
combo normal normal you if you a normal
skin I'm so jealous of you
she says her chemists worked for five
years to create this hyper-intelligent
formula that is totally full coverage
but yet weightless I totally agree with
the weightless part the formula
dispenses evenly over your skin it does
not sit imperfections creating your
flawless second skin whether you suffer
from acne redness discoloration or dull
tired magic foundation will give you a
perfect looking skin every day so as we
saw in the beginning of the video
you did kind of see some of my rosacea
peek through you know what I'm saying
and I felt like with a brush it was much
more sheer I don't know if he'd be
different I think she has a brush that
goes along with this foundation so I
don't know if that would make it look
different but not everybody is going to
want to go out and buy the foundation
and the brush you know so I think it's
good to try different foundations out
with a more affordable brush or a Beauty
Blender whatever and personally I liked
the Beauty Blender better and I thought
it covered much better I will try it out
with a different foundation brush the
artist one was not my favorite for it
the makeup geek foundation stippling
brush was not my favorite for it so you
have a pretty high-end brush and a
pretty affordable brush and I didn't
like either of them with it I like the
Beauty Blender better I'm gonna go and
I'm gonna run to Ulta and get a couple
things that I've had my eye on and then
I'm going to come back later do some
things around the house and update you
guys on this foundation and it will
probably be my last update so I will see
you in just a few hours 6:24 let's go
makeup shopping hey guys so it is the
next day and I know you're probably like
what the heck Kacie not how this is
supposed to go um but I didn't get to
film it ending it - my first impression
but I didn't want to throw all that
footage away because you know I still
wanted to use it was my first impression
of the product but I want to say ah this
is hard because I feel like in this
video I've been so up and down I love a
foundation the foundation is not full
coverage bla bla bla so I'm going to
tell you what I think about this
foundation now I'm wearing it again
today I wanted to try it out with some
different products as well and last
night I had to really blot and powder my
face a lot I mean a lot
I was so shiny it was terrible I was
really surprised about how shiny I was
too because throughout the day I was
doing okay and then as the the hours
just went on it was just getting worse
and worse and it's the oil that looks
gross that's like sitting on top of your
skin it was just bad so I had to blot
and powder a lot throughout the night it
did last for a really long time like
none of my redness peaked back through
or anything like that and I do think it
has a great finish
like for me I would not purchase this
foundation again I'm actually gonna
return the one that I got from Nordstrom
because I don't see myself using this a
lot especially since it's about to be
hot and really humid it was really humid
yesterday so that probably had effect
with the foundation but today as I've
been filming another video I've had to
blot my face and powder so many times
and I'm not really sure why because I
didn't have to yesterday as much as I
have been today I think if you're oily
you could also use it just depends on
what you want in your foundations if you
want to stay extra modified I would use
a really intense mattifying primer and
hopefully that would help I personally
don't like super intense mattifying
primers because then it just looks
really balled up on my skin but for me I
just felt like I had to really work with
my makeup all night and I wasn't that
impressed by it especially for the price
tag so that is my conclusion on this
foundation was up and down I really
loved the finish I loved the way look
throughout the beginning of the day like
after for about I would say four to five
hours I loved the way it looked and then
after that it was just like no no no no
no no but I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and if you did like it don't
forget to give a thumbs up if you've
tried this foundation let me know down
below what your thoughts are what your
skin type is I would love to hear it and
I will see you all in my next video bye
