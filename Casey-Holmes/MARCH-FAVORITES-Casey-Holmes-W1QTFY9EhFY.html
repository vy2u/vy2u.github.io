to be my March favorites and I've got
this month right last month for February
favorites I said it was March favorites
but now I was really confused this is
March favorites that was February I was
on a whole nother hot mess that month
I'm gonna show you guys some of the
things I've been loving for this month I
don't have a lot of makeup favorites but
I have quite a bit of like makeup random
things so hopefully you guys like it I
want to go ahead and shout out this
bronzing spray this is the lorac
tantalizer body bronzing spray I love
this so my foot too more detail in my
spring must-have switch if you guys
haven't seen Ally get down below but
this is a great way to kind of just have
a really quick bronze tan if you don't
have enough time to self Tate or
something like that this would be great
it is waterproof but as long as you have
soap and water it will come off um it
doesn't like stay on permanently so I
love this if I'm having self-tan mishaps
which I probably should have sprayed
before this video this was just a
product that I had no idea that I had
and I discovered it and I was like I
love you yes I'll go ahead and start off
with makeup and just go ahead and get
makeup done this has been my favorite
lip gloss at the moment I love pairing
this with a matte stripped down this is
a Lancome lip lover in three one four
and I love this I've mentioned this
before but I actually just found this
again because I tend to put makeup in my
clutches obviously when I'm going out to
touch up and then I forget what's in
them and I just start hanging them up
and then I'm looking for makeup products
and I'm like okay I'm not going through
all these cross pipes to try to find one
lip gloss the one time that I switch up
my crossbodies I find all my makeup
products though I love this it's such
cute packaging you just press this
button and it pops up and I love it it's
just so pretty
it's not sticky and on it's just really
nice and smooth on the lips so I've been
loving using stripped down like all over
my lips and then topping this off with
it and it's a nice kind of darker glossy
nude and
one of my favorites so Lancome lip lover
in three one four I was about to sing
that one song hey everybody from the to
go through was it three of three or two
or two favorite is honestly oh I did not
think I was gonna love this foundation
as much as I do this is a L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte Demi matte
foundation I love this paired with the
number seven beautifully mapped primer
these are just amazing you guys I love
it right now I have fresh press know
right now I have fresh beige on and I
just I love it that's giving Dimmie
matte finish so it's gonna give you a
matte finish but look a little bit more
natural and it is more of a medium to
full coverage finish I don't necessarily
like building this up but I do like to
go ahead and apply it all over and if
there's some redness peeking through
I'll just put my concealer on and I'm
usually good to go so love this
foundation so much it lasts so long on
me I use this when I went out Saturday
and I did get a little oily and I had to
powder but that's kind of normal for me
since I do have super oily skin but it
lasted all night long so love this so
much okay so next is the blush that I've
been wearing for make a peak all the
time it is in the shade in effectuation
and this is just beautiful like it goes
with so many different makeup looks and
I just absolutely love it to death it's
really easy to blend it's like a neutral
peachy color like it's just stunning so
that's it right there
I just I adore it I also want to mention
this makeup brush from makeup geek it is
the face buffer brush this has changed
the game for me when applying my
foundation I absolutely adore this
foundation brush it's really dirty
because I've been using it this with the
L'Oreal foundation or even with my Estee
Lauder foundation it is just so good it
blends everything in like a dream we
just go in circular motions and it's
like everything just looks flawless on
the face i I can't say enough good
things about this I have not touched my
Sigma f80 brush since I got this bad boy
and I have also not applied foundation
when my Beauty Blender since I got this
so I think it's a little pricey but it's
an awesome foundation brush and I
we recommend it okay so I only have one
more make up product I told you guys
didn't have a lot in makeup wise in this
video this Me Too Faced better than sex
mascara this mascara is perfect if you
wear false lashes all the time on the
days that you don't wear false lashes
you want your lashes to look like you're
wearing false lashes this is the mascara
for you I just love this it makes my
lashes look super fluffy and just I
don't know it looks so amazing and it
looks like I'm wearing false lashes what
I'm wearing this I just I absolutely
adore I used to talk about all the time
and I'm back to using it it's a little
pricey but it's definitely worth the
money that you spend on it at least for
me it makes my lashes look bobomb okay
so the next thing I want to talk to you
guys about is skincare I just have a few
skincare items to share with you the
first thing is actually something I got
as a sample from Sephora it's the
bullsháá or vitalizing black hydration
gel and this stuff is great I've been
using this for the daytime and I really
really like it it makes my skin feel
super soft but it's still kind of like
tightens the skin and it makes it feel
like I'm not gonna get as oily
throughout the day it really helps
mattify the skin for a long period of
time and i think i was i was going
through a point earlier in the month
where i was having a really bad break
out due to a serum that i was using and
this helped me get back to like clear
skin I was using the face wash as well
that kind of goes with this line but I
left it in Dallas when I was there for
media con so I love these I think they
really helped clear it up my skin and
they also help control the oil as well
next is it tarte maracuja maracuja right
I think that's right neck treatment and
I love this I've actually been using
this for quite some time you can't even
you can't even see it's barely in there
but it's actually almost gone and I love
this neck treatment so much because when
you put it on I feel like it kind of
blurs any imperfection imperfections
that you have and it just hydrates the
skin so well and I don't know I really
really love it it just keeps my skin
hydrated for a long period of time I use
this the morning and a night and it's
just one of my favorite products ever I
love the fact that you're supposed to
specifically use this for your neck so
whenever I apply it I just put a dab on
here
down my neck and chest and kind of go
upwards like this so yeah I love this I
purchased it from Sephora a while back
and it's definitely one of my favorite
hydrating products
speaking of hydration and my legs have
needed some serious hydration like they
were so dry that I had scabs on my knee
from like just dryness not even I didn't
fall it was just from being so dry so I
have been using this combo for my legs
oh my god my wrists are so bad but I've
been using this combo for my legs and
has been doing some wonders so I will
get out of the shower and I will use
this lush strawberry fields forever
massage bar oh it smells so good it's
the best smelling massage bar I feel
like lush hats it is so amazing all the
other lush massage bars just kind of
smell like earthy if you know what I
mean like I just don't like this smell
this smells damn good I love it so oh so
I'll put this all over my body it kind
of just like melts into your fingers if
there's one thing that you need from
lush it's definitely this massage bar
shop it feels forever so after I put
that all over my legs I will then go in
with my luck suit on supple skin oil and
I love this actually a sample of it and
used it all up this month and then I've
been using more of this as well and this
is just a really great oil to put on
your skin I don't like to use this
during the daytime I only do this
routine at night because very oily I
like it because I'll wear loose pants at
night so that it doesn't rub all over
the place and it really sinks into the
skin and hydrates it so yes I love this
for the night time not in the daytime
since it isn't oil
but man this stuff is good I love luck
suit on in general I also use their body
butter and it's just amazing like they
have amazing scam products if you're
having a really really hard time with
your skin being very dry L'Occitane is
the place to go and get you some good
skincare I also want to quickly shout
out my hair this hair is just giving me
so much life so I am wearing my foxy
locks extensions I'm only wearing three
tracks of wearing a four clip left and
two two clips and I mean this is just
so much hair and it looks so good I just
I love my foxy locks extensions
especially when I'm running on third day
hair or fourth day hair like I am today
because sometimes my natural hair will
tend to cling together as I go on not
washing it but this just I mean they
look so good every time I put them in
I'm like I just want to show you into my
head sometimes because I just love how
thick it makes my hair I'll leave the
set that I use down below okay so it is
now time for the best part of video oh
my god I totally forgot about gifts and
memes and stuff in favor edits of the
month so let's just go look at my
favorites on Twitter and see oh this one
