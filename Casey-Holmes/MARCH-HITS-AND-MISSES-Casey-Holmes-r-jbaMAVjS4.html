today I'm going to be sharing with you
my March hits and misses I do want to
quickly say I'm feeling a little under
the weather I think like I can't right
here so I'm probably yelling at you
right now I think it's the pollen the
pollen is really bad right now you have
some to do with it my throat started
hurting so bad at the lake yesterday I
think being at the lake and like in
nature kind of did some of it but yeah
I'm feeling a little under the weather
some sorry's I'm yelling at you if I end
up coughing sneezing all the above
because I just is so congested right now
but I had to fill my March hits and
misses because it is a new month is
April 2nd and I wanted to get this up
for you guys I also want to say thank
you guys for all the sweet comments on
my last video I know that video was
trending and sometimes those videos will
bring out a lot of like people I feel
like if you leave a negative comment on
a video like that it just shows what
kind of person you are because if
someone else is happy you should be
happy for them I found it kind of sad
that I have to delete a lot of comments
but that's just how the cookie crumbles
here on YouTube you get a lot of
interesting comments and you know what
it is written yeah I'm going to be
starting actually tomorrow I'm going to
meet my wedding planner so you guys will
see that on my blog tail so go check out
my blog channel and subscribe if you're
interested also before you leave don't
forget to subscribe to this channel it
is a right down here and also hit that
Bell and get notifications this month is
the month that I'm having my Chicago
beat up and I'm having another meet up
right after that the next weekend so I'm
going to go ahead and get started first
thing I want to talk about is this hair
you guys when was the last time that we
saw extensions in my hair I cannot even
remember this makes me want to grow my
hair I'm not even gonna lie like I'm
really wanting to grow this Mane out
especially for the wedding at the end of
the year Oh should I just kind of give
it away
putting these extensions in made me
really want to just go ahead and start
growing my hair out so I think this I'm
going to do I'm going to take one of
these ours to Nami bracelets off because
I don't like it when they jingle so I
don't like given aging more videos in
real life I don't mind but in videos
Buzzbee I absolutely love these they're
so so thick I have really thick hair as
it is I've got a lot of it and I need
think extensions to really blend in with
my hair and I just I've always loved
this brand you guys know I talked about
them forever so if you want to check
them out I'll leave them down below
there's
also a little coupon code Fox pkc I
believe but you can use that checkout to
get a free little gift so that's just if
you're interested but I have to say I am
going to start wearing these a lot more
because I missed them and they just make
me feel so much like a little sexier of
luminous too nice low de terre okay so
also I love this bracelet this is by the
Styles collection and actually ordered a
bunch of necklaces from them and I'm so
excited to wear them because they're
gold they're like dainty there's some
they're a little bit of a choker but
they're very layered and I love them
I've seen them everywhere I don't know
if it's supposed to completely screw and
all the way I mean it still kind of goes
like this but one of the sides will
unscrew and then you pull the whole bar
out and that's how you get it on and off
your wrist but I really love this and
then this is also another little
addition to the Alex and Ani bracelets
that I have I have this one I also have
an army one and then I have an Auburn
one and they were all gifts to me from
Davis's family this is from Davis's
mom's whenever we got engaged she got me
this and it's so cute it has a little
meaning behind it and I've never seen
one with a little crystal in it so I
love it if you want to know what this
bracelet is I'll leave it down below you
can see what the meaning is and
everything but it's so cute I love it
and yeah I do know pretty much it for
like fashion jewelry stuff and if you're
wondering this top is from Alice and
Olivia now I did not think I was going
to love this as much as I do because I
have a hard time finding facial self
tanners because as you guys know very
sensitive skin have rosacea so some
things like this can really make it
flare up and big on trying out facial
self tanners and this one is by far my
favorite and I totally agree with all
the claims we follow me on snapchat
which if you don't you should taystee
homes 35 I showed you guys this and told
you like all of the different claims
that I have so this is the Josie Maran
Argan liquid gold self-tanning face oil
it's a hydrating glow treatment and
basically this is just like a really
nice self-tanner for your face it had a
lot of claims on the Box saying like it
was very hydrated a lot of consumers
said that over a few weeks there was
even more hydrated and still had a
really nice glow to it I agree with that
100% now I have tried the josie maran
argan oil
I've tried there's like one for more
sensitive skin and the regular one I
cannot remember what they're called
because I haven't used them in so long I
was a little nervous to trust out
because the left those broken me out not
why it was probably just too heavy for
my skin so when I got this I was like oh
yeah a self-tanner and the oil mixed
together this could be a hot mess but it
was amazing and it gives your face the
most gorgeous glow it doesn't last for a
long period of time I will say that this
is something that I would apply probably
twice a week to keep a gradual tan
throughout the whole week it's not
something I was gonna stay on your skin
forever because you're always washing
and exfoliating your face so of course
it's going to come off but I do love the
color that it gives whenever I felt and
my body now and I have a really nice
dark tan I do like to put this on my
face it is a little dropper as you can
see so now I'm going to talk about one
of the foundations that I have recently
went back to that I'm loving I'm wearing
it right now and I'm in love with it
it's the Maybelline Dream matte mousse
so I have two shades the shades that I'm
wearing right now is light beige medium
zero so this is the one I'm wearing now
and it matches pretty well and then the
one that I wear when I'm nice and soft
hands like this is my next day
foundation for self-tanner this is a
natural beige medium 2.5 but I love it I
feel like it looks so good on my
textured skin the way that I applied it
today was just with this pure powder
foundation brush just a nice big brush
to buff it in I just love the way this
looks in the way it wears and the way
product looks on top of it is just
beautiful it doesn't look cakey it just
looks smooth and it's full coverage at
least on me it covers all my redness and
it's just phenomenal okay the next step
is the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
then cleaning out my makeup and donating
a lot of things just a get ready to move
in the next couple months you know I'm
not trying to bring up you know the
whole Sephora up to me in the whole
drugstore you know something I'm trying
to donate a lot of stuff and keep some
stuff going to need to use for work and
things like that and I came across this
concealer and I was like I'm going to
used to love that why don't I use it so
I end up using it again just such a
great medium to full coverage concealer
you can build it up to be more full
coverage but for me it's definitely more
medium on the first go around I like to
use this with my heart-shaped 8
concealer because this is so full
coverage and I'll do this right in inner
corner of my eye then I'll put the Urban
Decay Naked skin here on the outer parts
and then highlight the center of the
face with it and it's just so good it
blends so well another concealer that
I'm loving right now is the NARS creamy
matte concealer of the one that's in a
pot just came out nice
and it is so good it's in my car right
now because I took it to the lake so
it's pumped out all the way downstairs
in my car one of my favorites actually
meant to mention it last month it's
great for if you have pores and any
texture it just glides over it and melts
and some skins to full coverage
concealer it's the first like concealer
that I'm incredibly obsessed with
because if you're oily it doesn't make
you even more oily it doesn't make you
know your makeup take you throughout the
day or anything like that it just sits
so beautifully and it's just crazy how
it's so full coverage but it looks like
skin it's insane I just like to apply it
with a brush I'll just play it wherever
I want it and then blend out with a
Beauty Blender and I'm good to go such
an amazing product I would highly
recommend it okay so next up is kind of
like my brow routine so I've been using
this elf brow brush lately and I love it
it's a great dupe for my Sephora Pro
brow number 20 you can see that they're
both dual and did the only thing that's
a little bit different is that Sephora
one's a little bit wider but I mean it's
pretty much the same ordeal and this is
only like a couple dollars I think read
been using this with my makeup
revolution
brow pomade out of this one and the elf
gel cream one this one's my favorite I
don't know I just like the color a
little bit better but both the formulas
are really great so this one's in the
shade of blonde and you can see I have
been putting this to work it is so good
I have it on my brows now it's really
easy to work with I feel like it doesn't
look too harsh to just make my brows
look nice and full and you know like I
said it's just so easy to work with I
love it so actually I kind of feel like
my hair is what's making me not hear
that's how you notice it next up is this
a flower Beauty liquid liner I've had so
many of you tell me that your Walmart
doesn't have flower Beauty anymore which
is awful I'm pretty sure they have an
online site so I'm going to look and
leave it down below for you guys
supposedly they're getting replaced with
a different droste or brand which is the
drugstore brand that has been trying to
find but it can't find it any of my
Walmart's but supposedly they're doing
replace with that which kind of sucks
but it is what it is is a really great
liner it is a felt tip liner now this is
a longer felt tip so if you're not
really experienced with salt tips I
think you might have a hard time with
this I would try to cut it but I'm a
little nervous to do that you know what
I mean
just to cut it down like in half but
this is what it looks like and then that
is the liner there it's really nice and
black and it does dry matte which is
what I love in a liquid liner
I need my liners to dry matte because I
don't like a shiny liquid liner though
this is perfect again it's from the
drugstore and there's a lot of Walmart's
do not carry flower beauty any more I
will link down below where you can get
this because I'm sure Amazon has it or
that they have a website so I highly
recommend it is really really good and
I'm going to miss seeing these in
Walmart not gonna lie
gonna miss it I actually have a lot of
flower beauty products pretty sure and
what do you do this is going this is the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer and
this is the darkest one they do have two
shades and this is the darkest one I
notice you guys can tell but I have been
putting this baby to work I love it so
much it's the bronzer I have on now and
I honestly have nothing bad to say about
it I feel like it blends really well and
it smells so good even though I'm super
stuffy I still smelled it it is a pretty
intense smell personally to me once I
put it on my face I don't smell it again
it's just when it's in the pan and on
the brush and speaking of breath I've
been loving this to bronze my face I
know this is more of a newer product but
I have recently been in love with it and
I can't forget a lot more than my Tom
Ford one this is the Mac one for 0s I
like it because it's pinched right here
but it's still really fluffy and has a
lot of movement to it so I can really
bronze but my forehead nicely and my
cheeks and not give drugs are absolutely
everywhere no this is a Tom Ford one you
can see it's not as pinched as the math
one so I like that I have a little bit
more control with this cutter and I'm
just really enjoying it so thanks to Mac
for sending this week and then also for
contour I've been loving this more feet
m-52 3 brush a little bit different I
know when you see it you're probably
like for contour what I like it because
it's really fluffy and again has
movement there my vagin see it's not too
thin not too 6 but it just blends
contour so well I used to apply my
contour today and it's just really
precise but it blends everything so well
and it grabs the perfect amount of
product you know what I mean it's just a
great brush to work with and I really
like it I love finding new brushes to
contour with and just use a makeup and
I've actually been using this brush with
the flower beauty which is called lift
and sculpt contour palette this is a
really great contour palette from the
drugstore now this sounds like
crazy amount of fallout but to me I
don't mind that kind of stuff as long as
the product actually works
I don't mind tapping the bread shawl for
blowing on the palate it doesn't bother
me I know some people that does so it
does whether you're going to absolutely
hate this this does have a crazy amount
of fallout you just kind of gotta go
into it with an open mind and notes
going to have a lot of fallout but it is
going to perform really well this is the
contour it's really nice it's that
perfect kind of warm and ashy bronzer
this blush is beautiful I have both of
these on my face today this blush is a
great everyday color it's really not
showing up as well as it should
I mean it's really beautiful once you
put it on your cheek so that's the
contour that's the blush and then this
highlighter is really really blinding as
well it is so nice the powders are very
smooth easy to blend and I really like
them I think they're great I also love
the packaging it is see-through so you
can see what's working with and I don't
know I really like it I've been going to
it a lot and I think it's a great
product this is their flower pot blush
and sweet piece this is just a great
everyday color as you can tell these are
like the kind of colors that I like
right here kind of paint cut them all
again love the packaging of this and
that you can see it I love the rose on
here as well and this color is just
beautiful it's a little bit more
involved than the one in that palette
but it's still that same formula very
very creamy very easy to blend and
doesn't accentuate texture pores
anything like that so this product I
used for foundations oh don't hate me
this is the LA girl Pro HD powder and
this is the banana yellow one
so good you guys it's really going to
take a high-end powder to like sweet me
completely off my feet to be fit between
this the flower beauty loose powder I
mean you can't beat it it's so good I
love that this is that banana shade I
have to say I remember I used to be all
about banana colored powders you know
that yellow toned and I kind of just
like didn't care anymore I was like I'm
just going to try whatever loose powder
that I want but now I'm back on that
tinted yellow train and I just love it
it sets your makeup so beautifully this
is super affordable I believe la girl is
even insulted out I'm pretty sure yeah
this is just greatness that your makeup
with it does not accentuate texture it
doesn't rub off any foundation or
concealer all of that works at you
it doesn't take it off it mattifies the
skin and it doesn't look too powdery at
all I have it on now so I used to bake
with and I really loved it lots of
drugstore products this month because as
a lot of you know I've been on a
drugstore kick and I've just having so
much fun with the drugstore that it's
been hard for me to try a lot of
high-end products but I also have to
shout out these little drugstore goodies
these are DJ cat lips infinity matte lip
these are kiss proof and I 110 percent
agree with that these are mats they're
not going anywhere they're not drying
they feel so good on the lips I have one
on now which this is in the shade
bottles left to right I love this color
it's not really red and it's not hot
pink it's kind of that perfect mixture
between the two the nice bright lip and
I think it just makes any makeup look so
fun it doesn't sink into my fine lines
it doesn't crack around there or
anything it just looks so good the
formula of these is amazing I love it
they're compact this one is actually
stayed in my purse for a while this
one's in the shade of champagne buzz oh
I love this this is like my perfect
everyday nude color it is just gorgeous
and these lasts so long
eating drinking whatever you're doing
these lasts forever
okay so that's three misses for the
month and they are all drugstore as well
so the first one is this sponge just
actually came in a set that I bought
from Walmart and I'm just not a fan of
this I feel like I've tried this before
because this little rim right here I
remember this sponge somehow but I guess
I just didn't pay attention to it but I
don't like this because it doesn't blend
as well as I thought it would I don't
know how to explain it it's just a
really weird texture with blending out
your foundation it takes a lot longer
and it just doesn't make everything
blend and sink into the skin as well as
say my L'Oreal sponge this is what I use
today I'm obsessed with this Oriole
sponge if they ever get rid of it I'm
going to be upset like really upset I
would say save your money on this and
just go ahead and buy this pink one from
L'Oreal because I just I don't know just
the texture of this one it just doesn't
blend as well as the other ones that I
have now if you've watched my facebook
live you probably knew this is coming
because this was ported Facebook live is
always so interesting because obviously
you know I can't edit it we're just
sitting there talking about makeup and a
lot of the times I'm trying new products
with you guys on there if you haven't
liked my facebook you definitely show
I'll leave it down below it should
notify you every time I go live I try
this the last Facebook live and I am NOT
putting this on my lips I know I should
probably try stuff out before I say it's
amiss but let me tell you I was so
excited about this product this is the
long-wear lip cream in the shade pink
bouquet that's what it looks like
I even tried shaking this up and it
doesn't mix or anything I guess this is
just a bad batch or something I don't
know but you see this color right here
but look at this color like what is that
just the oil look at that to me like the
oil comes out and the actual product
doesn't so I'm not impressed by it it
kind of just grosses me out and it's so
separated that you can't even shake it
up to mix it all together so I don't
have to say this one's a pat and then
the last thing is not something that I
hate it's just something that can work
out for me and my skin type so I'm very
very oily in my t-zone and I need a
concealer that's not going to add more
oils to that and really build up on it
unfortunately this concealer just makes
me so early that I can't use it it's the
LA girl Pro conceal HD high definition
concealer it has really great coverage
if you have more normal to dry skin I
think you would love this I think some
oily skin girls love it as well but for
me it just didn't work out it is a great
product but like I said it just makes me
more oily and it's a little bit of a
hassle okay so now we're going to do
music favorites I'm sorry I'm like I'm
slowly drifting away because I feel like
my sickness is just getting worse look
getting to my eyeballs right now look in
my current favorites I do have a sci-fi
is kcal 91 you can follow me if you want
to if they are all open to public okay
so first off I would like to say I know
I said Ed Sheeran song last month wrong

interesting last set policy was bombing

few times you're going to be like that
dude don't worry I have to mention I
love this song by Brantley Gilbert
