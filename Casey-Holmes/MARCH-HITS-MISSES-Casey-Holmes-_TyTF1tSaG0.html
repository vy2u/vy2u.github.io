my March hits &amp;amp; misses and oh are you
not excited the dogs are in here today
we're having like this serious windstorm
outside so if you guys hear like windows
rattling it's because the winds going
like sixty miles an hour but a girl's
got to work so I'm excited to share
these products with you guys I don't
have a ton of new stuff I have a lot of
misses this month was definitely about
going back to old favorites and finding
my love for certain products because I
did have so many misses and this month
that it made me go back to certain
things that I know I loved and that I
wanted to use soap you guys are excited

definitely keep watching don't forget to
hit that subscribe button before you
leave and to hit that post notification
bell so that you can be notified every
time I upload a video so yeah if you
want to know what I've been loving for
the month of March then let's just go
ahead and get started so the first and
most exciting thing that happened this
month is my collab with Palladio
dropping I am so glad you guys are
loving these colors loving the formula
all of that I have Georgia on right now
I did a full video showing you guys
these colors the swatches telling me
about them in the formula and all of
that so if you want to check that out I
will leave it down below but I have been
wearing these so much I haven't been
able to tell you guys but now I can
finally let you know I wore obsessed in
my February hits and misses so if you
want to check that out I'll leave it
down below you guys are going bananas
over that color
there are $10 apiece available at
Sally's Beauty also at Palladio beauty
comm and I'm so excited because we're
having a meet-up in Georgia this
Saturday which is gonna be so fun and if
you want to come i'll leave more info
down below but i'm really excited to
meet up in georgia and just go back and
really celebrate this launch and you
guys so like i said i'll leave all that
info down below but thank you guys so
much for all the love on this collab it
means so much to me and i hope you love
them just as much as i do another thing
that happened this month i was really
exciting is I got hair extensions and a
lot of you asked what kind that I got so
I got the microbeads and they just like
micro beaded in a weft if that makes
sense actually Davis did this one
because I wanted to add one more and I
tried doing it by myself and I did awful
and then Davis
and I was like I have microbeads but
it's not like those individual strands
it's actually a weft so I gotta like dig
through here to find this so I don't
know if you guys can really see but
there's a weft and then they micro bead
and then they microbead my hair and some
of the extension hair my hair stylist
and I actually logged it so I'll leave
that down below whenever it is up so you
guys can check it out but it has been so
much fun having extensions literally I
can wake up look completely ridiculous
but my hair looks fabulous every time I
wake up and I'm just like this is what
it feels like I've just been really
enjoying having extensions I'm thinking
I'm gonna do like an update on my blog
channel kind of just saying my
experience how I felt that the first day
pretty much the second day and just like
my experience throughout the last couple
weeks is what they look like and I'm
really happy that I went to her and did
it because I was a little nervous at
first I didn't know how it was gonna
feel I didn't know if I wanted the
permanent aspect of it oh my gosh it's
been so great and now that I'm used to
like washing my hair and blow drying it
the first time I washed it I was like
this because it was so heavy I was like
oh my god am I gonna be able to do this
for like the next month and a half but
now I'm so used to it and I just I do
blow dry my hair in a specific way and
all that but I have been loving them
highly recommend but the reason why I'm
also talking about this is because I
could not get stuff done and any amount
of reasonable time without this for
blow-drying my hair ok got this Dyson
when it first came out I bought it
myself and I used to hold my hair and I
was like okay I mean it's like a basic
blow dryer get my hair done in like what
10 minutes which is good but I got
extensions I was like oh my god doesn't
take me forever to blow-dry my hair and
it really doesn't it takes me about 15
to 20 minutes so an extra 10 minutes
with all the hair that I have added in
takes more time for me to brush on my
hair than it does for me to blow-dry my
hair because I'm so gentle about it and
I go in sections I never used to do that
before but yeah I love this because it
really does dry the hair in no time it
doesn't really tangle my hair either
anyways I'm going on a tangent this has
been a May
if you have a lot of hair if you have
hair extensions and you just feel like
your drying time is just way too long
something like this is a great
investment another thing to do with hair
are these invisible elegant hair rings
oh my gosh you guys in love with these
me and my best friends have actually
been talking about these like how much
we're obsessed with them because we all
randomly like came on to him and one day
my best friend sent a picture to our
group and was like have you guys ever
tried these things they're like just
rubber like elastics it just looks
really weird people tie their hair with
it and I was like oh my god I love those
I just got some so this is actually my
second pack I'm obsessed with them they
don't tug in my hair or like pull my
hair out at all but they keep like my
buns in place have I talked about this
before in a video I think I talked about
in the video you guys haven't seen yet
I've been using this all month even a
little bit over a month and they are the
bomb okay moving on to a makeup remover
I have went back to my clinic take off
the day cleansing balm I was using
something different from origins I
believe it was a jelly-like makeup
remover cleanser I used pretty much all
of it up and it was nice like I started
using it and I was like well I'm not
obsessed with it but I'm gonna go ahead
and use up the whole product and I did
and then I finally went back to this and
I'm just like oh my gosh this is it
nothing can top the frickin Clinique
take off the day cleansing balm nothing
can I've been using this for years
it's a balm at first and then when you
start rubbing it into your skin it kind
of turns into a oil melts it all down
see you later
you're good to go I love this stuff
takes up absolutely everything it's one
of the best and I will always go back to
it alright let's move on to oh one other
thing that is not make up this Sonia
Kashuk quick clean dry brush spray I
actually filmed a video with this well
not with this but this was included it
wasn't my dollar makeup video I think it
was in my last video the dollar makeup
where I tried different things out but I
tried this out and I really liked it it
spot cleans very well after you clean
your brushes they're nice and dry ready
for new eyeshadow and it's just nice to
have this on the desk and just quickly
spray it it doesn't cause a lot of mess
or anything like that and it doesn't
leave your brush
is wet so I like this I will definitely
be repurchasing it again it is the Sonia
Kashuk quick clean dry brush spray and
you can get this at Target so two
foundations that I've been really
enjoying that I kind of went back to I
love these foundations they're staple in
my drawer so first one is one that I'm
wearing right now it's the Too Faced
Peach perfect comfort matte foundation
absolutely in love with this as well as
the peach perfect powder you guys
already know I love the powder and
foundation from this line I think it's
great makes my skin look really nice and
right now I'm wearing the shade warm
beige I love that it's a pump and it
doesn't accentuate pores your texture
it's just such a great all-around
foundation so highly recommend this if
you're oily another one that I went back
to is the clinic beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer this has such
great coverage I like to apply this with
a brush I actually have a video coming
soon featuring this foundation even
though I've been using this foundation
for so long I've put this foundation in
so many videos I love it I remember when
it first came out I remember the first
video I ever did on it it's just been
one of those staple products that I know
I could go to if I want full coverage if
I don't really want to add concealer
anything like that this is just a great
quick all-in-one product and I love it
the shade 17 nettie is perfect for me
when I'm just nice and self tan also
don't my my nose I was gonna go get them
done today but since I almost had my own
Wizard of Oz moment at the gas station
after getting a Diet Coke I decided to
stay home so sorry a new eyeliner that
I've been loving is the the balm Schwing
black liquid liner oh my gosh I saw this
on someone's Instagram videos and I just
saw the like most perfect winged
eyeliner and this is what gave me this
nice wing today I really like it if I'm
gonna use liquid liner this is a really
great one to use it's matte it's super
black and it has such a nice felt tip
like it's super pointy if you guys can
see right there look at that it is so
nice I can't believe I did not use this
for the longest time like they always
send it to me and PR and I'm like I'll
get to it but I saw that person's video
when searching for it and I was like
where have you been all my life okay
next up is a new highlighter it's the
anasazi Omri Z a highlighter this is
such a gorgeous you see my leggings okay
I think you guys
this really in any of my videos that
I've been using it a lot off-camera and
like if I'm going out on the weekends or
Davis this is where I've been using the
highlight as well it is just so pretty
it's not what I have on right now either
because I used a different highlight
palette but I love this one so much it
is very intense but it's very very
smooth as well it doesn't really
accentuate your pores it just really
makes your cheeks pop so I'll just use
my own style to a23 with it you honestly
don't need that much product unless
you're wanting a blinding highlight and
sometimes I'll just blend it right on
the center of my cheekbones and it just
makes a highlight pop another thing I
went back to is the Laura Mercier matte
radiance baked powder in bronze is 0-3
oh my gosh why did I ever stop using
this is the real question I have no idea
why I quit using it it is so beautiful I
can't say it enough it just looks so
good on the skin it looks like your skin
it literally looks like you went to the
beach and you came back and you're just
so bronzed it's smooth blends out so
easy oh so good when I'm a little bit
lighter I'll use the shade bronze of a2
but when I'm more tan I will use bronze
on three last product I have for you is
this essence brighten up banana powder I
really like this because it has a banana
tint to it I also like that it's pressed
because I use it specifically to
brighten up any look when I did this
look today I said like my concealer was
just a little bit too dark after I did
some powder so I went back in with a
more precise brush put this underneath
my eyes it helped highlight a little bit
more and I took it down the center of my
face and that's what I like to do if I
just feel like my powder took something
a little bit too dark or whatever love
this it kind of just looks like a veil
of your skin doesn't kick up or anything
like that it's just simply to brighten
everything up and I have been loving it
for that what if you also people
wondering I'm still been using this
freaking thing non-stop
let's talk about the most expensive ass
perfume I've ever purchased in my life
okay no I did purchase the Tom Ford but
luckily I decided to try the sample size
first now I have an issue with this
perfume and there's a reason why I
haven't returned it yet okay let me tell
you this story real quick before we you
know before you talk about the product
that we talked about the story so let me
tell me how much of this okay let me
tell you how much I bought the Tom Ford
what it was it the the white perfume
love the smell of it but it don't last I
don't even have it anymore because I
need long-lasting perfume so this
perfume for this travel size is 175 now
before you come for me okay
I believe in nice perfumes I believe and
just if it's good and it's gonna last
spend the money
this had five stars okay how many
reviews did I have and it says the
floral scent the key notes are rose
tuberose
and jasmine I love rose and jasmine
don't know about the last one okay so I
read this and I was so intrigued the
perfect fragrance for good girls who
dared to turn bad and sexy to be warned
wherever they want to be kissed the good
girl gone bad a de Parfum will last
until the end of the night okay that
sold me right one of these reviews as
Killian fragrances are not inexpensive
but they are well worth the splurge in
my opinion the good girl gone bad is one
of my very favorites among any brand if
you love fruity florals it's well worth
the sniff I was like okay I can do with
that and then she says I typically I
typically get 8 to 12 hours of wear dr.
tada it says it's been my signature
scent for over three years now I
purchased both the large and travel
sized men love this scent I received
multiple compliments every day is sent
in super sexy and then like any scent on
the market so that kind of sold me I was
like ooh I hope Davis to think like I
smell super sexy you know I want him to
like love the scent I will say even
though it's expensive you get a really
cute travel case and then three refill
and this little compact thing is not
like scent bird okay this is got some
weight to it this is like a jewelry
piece it's magnetic you take it off you
have the scent okay I check this out I
smelt it I sprayed it and I was like oh
it smells kind of musty to me just kind
of smells a little weird I was just kind
of taken back cuz I was like men love
this scent really I don't see how they
love it so I put it on and I went into
the room and I said Davis will you smell
this he smelt it he was like oh my god I
love that no I was like this is one of
those
Onix that has gotten in between for me
I'm trying to figure out if I can like
this set but when I spray it it just
does not smell good on my skin it just
smells like when I spray this it just it
gives me like what does it give me I
don't smell any florals in this and
that's probably because I have a
specific type of floral scent that I
like I mean there's a lot of really
great reviews a lot of people love this
product it is expensive but it does last
a really long time I will say that but I
don't know something about the set man
I feel like I got to return it but I had
to tell you guys that little story time
I feel like every time I don't like
something Davis really likes it and then
I try to make it work because I'm like
why do you like it let me know if you
have this review I want to hear you what
you love about it and what you think it
smells like because I don't know maybe
it's me
okay believe it or not I mean using this
product from my misses section for years
and I went back to it because I kind of
quit using it because I found cheaper
alternatives and I just don't love it as
much as I used to and I think it's this
color and it is the beauty blender the
og beauty blender I don't know what it
is but I just don't feel like this
blends out my foundation and stuff as
well as my Real Techniques face and body
sponge know maybe you two used to the
sponge that's the size my face I mean
that's probably what it is I'm used to a
sponge that's besides my face that is so
squishy and so easy to apply that I have
to go back to this this is how big it
gets this is dry look at that I feel
like for me I prefer the nude and the
black Beauty Blender over the pink I'm
just not a big fan of the pink anymore I
feel like there's other more affordable
alternatives like the Real Techniques
ones the Sonia Kashuk sponge but I just
prefer this one so much it's just so
much more squishy and I just blends
really easily so I'm sorry Beauty
Blender it's nothing personal but I just
don't like the pink one anymore next one
is from a video you guys will be seeing
very soon it is the Becca soft light
blurring powder in pink haze I was
really excited to try this because I
read the bio and I was like oh my gosh
it's getting really good really excited
and I just hate the pink tent I hate the
pink tent it is so pink
I put it on my face and it does brighten
but I don't notice it's smoothing out my
texture anything like that and I feel
like it's hard to blend like if you're
not able to blend this quickly it's just
gonna you're gonna see where you put the
pink you know what I mean
this is just not my favorite I want to
know if you guys have tried it that
doesn't even show you how pink it is
like it is bubblegum pink can you tell I
don't think so
next up is another fragrance that is
pretty expensive
it's these Chanel body oil I love the
smell of this I've had a perfume this
smell and I was like ooh I love it it's
just one of those classic scents so I
wanted something that was gonna last all
day it was like a body oil moisturizing
I was all for it so I got this is the
chance by Chanel and I don't know it
doesn't last long at all it's not even
strong like it's not as strong as I
thought it would be I have another body
oil that is pretty potent that I really
like a lot and for a chance Chanel
perfume this just doesn't last that long
especially with it being a body oil you
know sometimes you can layer with this
kind of stuff and it'll last all day but
I don't smell this much longer after I
put it on I'm gonna be returning this
wasn't the biggest fan it just wasn't
what I expected and then another thing
that I got from Sephora is this touch
and soul medalists cream shadow palette
I want to see how much this was because
I'm feeling like it wasn't that
expensive but it could be I need to see
how much this was before I kind of go in
on it $42 this is the touch insult
medalist high shine bouncy cream shadow
palette this was $42 you guys this
packaging is drugstore packaging this is
plastic this is this is cheap plastic
watch this this is not $42 I was
thinking this would be more around like
the $25 range
no not high-end packaging at all first
off now that I know it was $42 I'm
pissed because I purchased this forever
ago but anyways I got it and I was like
these colors are so beautiful packaging
sucks but it's beautiful because
honestly this packaging doesn't look
like something you buy at Sephora I went
in to use these shades and I was like
what in the world first off my
aren't bouncy and they're really not
that pigmented this one's about to come
out the pant honey I don't think you
guys can see that but it has been lifted
since I got it I don't know if I just
got a bad one but I did try using these
with my fingers and whatnot over I
shadow by themselves this white one that
I expect to be really intense like you
can still see like I don't know if you
guys can see but you can still see my
skin through that it's a very light
sheer product when you go to blend it
it's gone you know it's one of those
just I don't get it hey guys so that's
all the hits and misses all the products
for this video and now we're gonna get
on to the best part the song favorite I
don't even know if I have a lot of song
favorites but we're about to figure it
out because I have been listening to
different stuff I feel like so we will
see one of my favorites this month first
off is a podcast so I've been traveling
down to Georgia a lot and I listen to
different podcast it really helps with
the drive that helps me kind of get my
mind off things it's kind of not good
when I decided to stop and stay at a
hotel because I get really scared but
I've been listening to murder podcasts
there's something about murder podcast
that I like the storytime about it I
cannot listen to people talk in a
podcast for an hour I just can't do it I
cannot listen to people just like jibber
jabbering about nonsense one of my
favorites that really got me on to these
kind of podcasts is up and vanish by
Tenderfoot TV which is based in Atlanta
which is so cool this up and vanished
one is definitely amazing because
there's a new podcast rattling a monster
yeah listen to that the best part about
up and vanish is it's a story that is
like in real time like they're trying to
figure out this murder and so many
things happen you have to don't google
it until you listen to the whole thing
do not google the story until you listen
to the whole thing cuz you'll ruin it
for yourself but it is so good to listen
to and it's so interesting to see how
things work with that podcast so
definitely recommend up and vanished
I've also listened to Atlanta monster so
my other favorite podcast is my favorite
murder with Karen and Georgia they're
funny I do have to skip like to like the
20 minute mark sorry guys I do have to
skip to there because I like the
storytime part of it or
it's like the up and vanished one where
it's like real-time I'm obsessed with it
so I kind of just get forward quite a
bit to get to like the story of
everything they tell a lot of really
great stories sometimes it's gruesome
and like if I'm eating in the car and
I'm listening to a story and it's
stressing me out like I'll have to stop
eating because I'll get nauseous like
it's pretty graphic stuff but it's like
interesting to listen to it and see how
people get caught and different things
like that so yeah highly recommend those
podcasts if you like murder my street or
just like story times if you're
travelling like I do and you go into a
hotel you're gonna be so paranoid so
paranoid you'll you'll be looking around
like I look at the closets I look
underneath the bed I look in the shower
if my shower curtain is closed first off
why do hotels do that why don't you just
leave it open it looks better that way
anyway so you scare me closing it all
right moving on those are really great
podcast highly recommend it
I really love Taylor Swift I love her
music I feel like every song she comes
out with even bad blood when I first
listened to it I was like the hell is
this but then I loved it it just like
grew on me and girl me she like cast a
spell and now I'm obsessed with her so
no matter what song she has I really
love them I love all the new songs from
her recent album because they're just
different and I love the lyrics I always
love her lyrics oh yeah delicate is one
of my newest favorites I like this one
gorgeous
another thing too is I've been listening
to my throwback playlist on Spotify
which I do have a public Spotify it's
just kcal 91 the same as my Instagram
and I've been really enjoying like older
songs that I used to listen to so um
here's one right here
oh I got one okay so I was going back to
Georgia and I heard this song in my
throwback playlist and I was like oh my
god I used to love this song and for
obvious reasons
oh my god you guys have you seen the
music video for oh my god what was it
for
was it walk it for walk it like I talked
it migos a Drake first off I love that
song but the music video you have to go
watch it it is so funny oh I've been
listening a lot to sugar this is a month
of me going back to what I loved
sugar song by Maren Morris oh my god
the vase but I hate this
that was born yesterday you have got me
wrong this makes me want to put a lot of
makeup on I don't know why you busy part
another subtle like is dogs working
cause you hear it constantly
the last song I'm gonna mention in this
video is by Jake Owen and it's called I
was Jack you were Diane I love this song
I can only imagine how amped up a
concert would be with that song like if
he is playing that that's like a closer
you know like a finishing off the good
concert closing song anyways this video
is incredibly long I'm gonna go ahead
and get off now I hope you guys enjoyed
