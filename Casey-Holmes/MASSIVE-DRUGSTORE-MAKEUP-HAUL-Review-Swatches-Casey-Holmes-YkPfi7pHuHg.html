a huge drugstore haul I have been going
absolutely insane past couple days and
that is because the drugstore has put
out so many different new products that
I just can't resist I actually just did
a full demo review on some new
wet-and-wild products I have them almost
all over my face it's pretty much I mean
so many different face products lips or
wet and wild and everything like that so
if you want to check it out I will leave
that video down below it should be up
for this one I did film it um right
before this one so that's why I'm
wearing the same exact thing and don't
mind this right here I don't know if I
got scratched or something
there's like a perfect line right there
and I don't know where it came from I
just noticed it and I was like hey
what's going on so anyways I want to
show you guys what I got and there's a
ton of goodies I've tried some of this
stuff and I want to I want you guys to
let me know what you want to see like
what videos I just did a grouping one of
like you know first impressions but I
kind of want to do like a drugstore
foundation routine now because I found
new products that I love to use together
and yeah so I give this video a thumbs
up if you love makeup hauls especially
drugstore hauls and leave a comment down
below
what you are most excited to try from
this video because there's a lot of
stuff out I mean there's a lot of oh
yeah I can't keep up so the first thing
these aren't new but I wanted to get
them because I've been really trying to
find really good drugstore brushes
lately and it's just my mission to put
together a pile that I can share with
you guys that I think you guys should
try so I got two real technique brushes
I did not know Walgreens carried Real
Techniques but they do I just got the
base flawless core brushes and then I
also got the your eyes enhance - starter
kit so want to try these up again I used
to have them and I don't know where they
went
I also got this L'Oreal infallible
mechanical eye liner and it says Matt
magic so it's going to be a matte eye
liner it has a gel green a gel green it
has a gel cream formula and I got it in
ultra black so I cannot wait to try that
for my waterline because I love anything
this is a product I want to do a first
impression on it's the revlon colorstay
two-in-one
if the makeup is a compact makeup and
concealer and the concealers a little
bit lighter than the foundation but I
really want to try this because you just
looked intriguing the packaging is a
little noxious but I just want to try it
out I haven't really seen any videos on
this and it's from the color stand line
and usually the color stay line is
really good so hopefully that's really
awesome another thing that I got this
isn't makeup but this is the L'Oreal
perrea perrea this is the L'Oreal Paris
transport and sweat-resistant sublime
bronze wash off body makeup lotion and
it's a medium so it's just a body
bronzer you can rub on it kind of like
the Sally Hansen stuff and I just want
to try it so I thought that was really
fun and I have some I have another ball
to go to and a cocktail party to go to
next month like right behind each other
not right behind each other but like
right after each other so I might do get
ready with me and stuff and I wanted to
use this for my legs because homegirl
has a huge bruise on her leg and luckily
nobody saw it on Year's Eve because I
had a longer dress oh this is new and
this is really fun and interesting I'm
actually gonna trust probably tonight
this is the Real Techniques deep
cleansing gel for makeup brushes um I'm
excited about this this is really cool
so it's a makeup brush cleanser from
Real Techniques so it's drugstore and
how much was this Real Techniques isn't
cheap I will say that but this was oh my
gosh well this is $8.99 so let's be real
that's not bad at all compared to some
other ones you know I'm talking about
and then I got new things from
Maybelline and let me just tell you
Maybelline killed it I'm not sponsored
by Maybelline or anything I've never
really I've ever worked Maybelline but
y'all they've been killing it and these
new products I'm obsessed with and you
need them and you like these next three
things you have to have in your life so
the first thing is what I am just
floating around right now this is the
foundation I have on it's a little too
light for me the color I'm wearing right
now is natural beige but it also got
caramel the one in between these was
little too red looking and these looked
more yellow neutral so I wanted to try
them out this is the dream velvet soft
matte hydrating foundation
I love this I want us to date night the
other night with Davis and he thought it
literally did on my skin it was smooth
it stayed matte for a really long period
of time I did have to touch up but not
as much this just looks so good it's
full coverage and it makes my skin look
flawless I've been using this over my
Marc Jacobs one that I've been using a
nice don't get me wrong I still love it
but this for being drugstore is freaking
phenomenal this is amazing and it's a
squeezy to travel friendly I'm obsessed
with it I haven't really reviewed like
the flashback issue I haven't really
been able to test that out yet but I
will test it out and let you guys know I
will update you but so far everything
else the coverage longevity everything
it's just flawless and it absolutely I
love this you need it in your life my
desk is such a mess right now okay the
next thing you have to have in your life
is this master contour from Maybelline
it's the face contouring kit I got the
one from medium to deep these are very
pigmented and very intense especially
the contour so just be careful with it
but it blends out really really easily
it does come with a brush which I won't
use but um I love this this highlight
you guys is everything I'm obsessed with
this highlight like I love it when I put
this on the other day I wanted to film
the video right then and just be like
dope with this now because this
highlight is all you need in your life
but the contour blush and highlight all
three of these in this palette is
absolutely beautiful
I adore every single one the contour is
great if blends really easily is more on
the warm tone side so just be aware of
that the blush is beautiful it's just a
pinky golden blush it's kind of like
NARS orgasm and then this one honestly
this highlight shade reminds me of opal
from Becca
it is stunning and it's so pigmented oh
and then the last thing I tried from a
lane that I'm just so happy with is the
master fix setting and perfecting loose
powder sets mattifies blurs and smooth I
hundred percent agree with that I use
this to set my face the other day and it
was beautiful it was flawless I think
it's even better than Laura Mercier
translucent powder it's so finely milled
and I don't know I
love it and they have the sifter right
here on the edge it doesn't give out too
much product I love this I mean I will
probably continue with this powder over
high-end ones any day of the week
because first off it's less than half
the price and it's just flawless like I
cannot get over it so definitely check
out the master fix setting and
perfecting loose powder it's so good it
is translucent and it lasts for 24
months if you're wondering I just saw
that in the autumn school so 24 months
this I also tried and really enjoyed
with the Maybelline foundation it's the
covergirl trublend face primer for oily
skin this is different it has like a
lotion e you know as a lotion
consistency to it but once you rub it in
it just really sets and mattifies the
skin and it dries it doesn't feel like
you have a lotion on your face it really
sets and sinks into the skin really
quickly and it feels really good it
doesn't feel greasy or anything like
that and I really did enjoy that primer
Maybelline foundation goes on great
anyways but with that primer it went on
even smoother and just look just so
Follis so I really like that covergirl
face primer and I didn't think I wasn't
like it let me tell you they also have
one for dry and I believe combo skin if
you guys are not an oily skin girl like
myself I've tried so much of this stuff
that I'm just like oh I love it
because this is another thing that I
love this is the covergirl true naked
nudes palette says shades like a leading
$50 eyeshadow palette the shade is real
covergirl I see you and this is
beautiful this one is in the shade nudes
nice oh they have names on them how cool
they have names on the back if you are
wondering they're right here um but this
is what it looks like guys these are so
freakin pigmented like I'm not like
don't mind my pinky actually I'll put
the pinky in the black like these are
intense highly pigmented they blend
really well I love them you can just see
how gorgeous they are on my fingers like
these are absolutely beautiful adore
them so much there's so many good things
out right now like the jokes or is
killing it
raising their prices but they're coming
up with a better product so I mean it's
kind of like give-and-take you know
since I love all of the new Maybelline
stuff I was like hey maybe I'll like
this it's the master fix we're boosting
setting spray I says it locks in makeup
for long-lasting finish and it's
translucent and oil-free so yeah I just
wanted to try it you know honestly I
don't really have high hopes for these
kinds of things I got one from when
Walden used it today it's so good but I
don't know if they really make your
makeup last longer but hey at least it
feels good on the skin so something to
try all right let's talk about something
that I tweeted the other day and it is
these Maybelline vivid matte lipsticks
now let me just say I've talked about a
lot of abling things that I like let's
talk about these I love the colors let
me just tell you right now this one is
in five which is more than nude 10 which
is the pinky r1 and then 50 which is
what I am in your face Dork I like these
I like the formula and I like the
texture they don't dry like a matte
finish they're like creamy matte but the
only thing I don't like is the fact that
they taste like fragrance and I don't
like that it gives me anxiety when I can
taste fragrance in my mouth I don't know
why but I start to think I'm like I have
a reaction or something like that I just
start getting a little bit of anxiety so
I don't like that I'm going to try these
out one more time yeah they have a they
have a fragrance to them just just be
full warned I am gonna try not one more
time and see if I can deal with the
fragrance like because I could taste it
but it just sucks because I love these
colors and I love the formula that I
just I wished it was fragrance free I
really do
oh my god they're so beautiful that 50
is almost black like it's a really deep
purple color and yeah I love the colors
and the formula if you can deal with the
fragrance I would definitely check them
out because I think they're great but
the fragrance part is what threw me off
and I'm not a huge fan yet so if I don't
like them I'm going to return them but
I'm going to give them one more go
because they're so cute and the
packaging is just adorable
let me talk about things I do like
so I love the L'Oreal infallible Pro
matte glosses I picked another one up in
3:18 I have 318 and 316 well right now I
have two 3:18 I just got another one for
backup because I have one in my purse
and I know it'll never come out of there
um but I adore these I love the doe foot
applicator
I love the application I love the
longevity I love every freaking thing
about these glosses if you love the
color that you see on the stand I
definitely recommend picking them up
they're not a dry matte formula at all
it is a matte gloss so it doesn't last
super super long but it does last a
really long time on me and I love the
colors and the formula perfection killed
it L'Oreal these I haven't tried yet but
I'm really excited to try them now I've
heard that these aren't sorry I'm on a
focus now I've heard that these are not
the best for the foundation just because
they're a little too dense but I've
heard they're great for setting your
under-eye and applying under-eye
concealer so I'm side by two to put my
concealer on and then to set with so
yeah I think they're adorable they're
just like little sticks fun jizz and I
just like them a lot how like honestly
who wants to pass it up and it has a
really nice chip like you get right in
there so if you guys want a first
impression on this let me know and I
will do that for you guys I mean I kind
of just felt it as a purse impression
but I didn't apply anything so let me
know if you guys want a review on this
because I'm really excited about these
okay next up our L'Oreal I got so much
definis ridiculous so next up I got
three L'Oreal eyeshadows I got number
200 oh that is nice just feeling into
that that is a nice eyeshadow right
there beautiful
so that's 200 this one is in cafe 203
that's fitting for every these off oh
all right well this one's really
pigmented too
now I just done my finger into it these
are really soft and nice so gorgeous oh
hi that much is my sweater this is a
gorgeous color damn these are intense
I like these if you see a color you like
with this packaging like this eyeshadow
get up because these are phenomenal and
then I did get like a dark navy this is
number 209 waar it says noir says snore
I don't know I don't go too deep into
the names like that I just say the first
part of it usually this is actually a
black it looks like a little bit Navy
but this is good that is probably the
blackest drugstore I shall ever seen in
my life - this one let's check out my
finger that is and it's soft and it
feels so good look at that black sari Oh
a few more things and then I'm almost
dead I swear I'd notice like 30 minutes
long so L'Oreal has these new little
blushes and a bronzer this bronzer is in
just bronzer oh it's number 200 and I
just want to try that because I think
they have stuff like this don't they I
think this is like a line or something
but I've never tried them before so I'm
going to give them a go that's that
bronzer it's very gold in don't know if
I'd use it as a bronzer or blush but it
is really pretty actually maybe I don't
know that might be a nice bronzer oh no
we'll see I'll play it and see but it's
very very golden I think that would be a
gorgeous blush and in my opinion that's
what I would probably use it for then I
did get a blush and medium rose this
just looks like a shade I would wear
most often so that's what it's like it's
like a Mavi pink very very pretty has
like a glow to it I'm excited to try
that out and then I did get this new
shade from the revlon matte balm i love
these i think these are great and this
color just stood out to me this isn't
the clerks - i can't talk this isn't the
color 265 fears that's my kind of color
right there and I also did get Seamaster
concealed by Maybelline I have not tried
this yet so I wanted to pick a tube of
it so I wanted to pick up a tube of it
so I want to pick up a tube and try it
out so I'm really excited about that and
then I did pick up this covergirl
plumpify mascara I tried it once but I
had so much lash glue on my lashes that
was kind of pointless because it's all
clumped together but I will try it out
let you guys know the
is ginormous just FYI but hopefully
hopefully it's good
hopefully we'll like it I hope you guys
