a makeup tutorial on this look right
here I absolutely love it it's just a
dramatic cut crease I did a different
technique to really make this lid pop
out at you actually pretty easy to get
it's a little bit tedious sometimes like
if you mess up a little bit you gotta go
in and fix this here and there but for
the most part it is fairly easy and I
think it's such a gorgeous classic look
this whole eye look is used with this
palette and then I'm wearing a liquid
lipstick so it's a matte one only shine
I have going on is my highlight because
I couldn't go without the highlight I
hope you guys enjoyed this all Matt -
the highlight to follow makeup tutorial
with a red lip and if you do like it
don't get to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel I upload it
three times a week Tuesdays Thursdays
and Sundays so make sure you subscribe
so you can get notified whenever I
upload a video and yeah if you liked it
give it a thumbs up let me know in the
comments and if you want to see how to
get this look then let's just go ahead
and get started okay so my eyes are
already primed and ready to go I'm gonna
take this shade right here and I'm just
going to set my lid so that all the rest
of the shadows that we put on glide on
smoothly and they don't catch on to that
primer then I'm gonna take this color
right here and I'm gonna put this into
my crease with a fluffy blending okay
with a fluffy of a lending brush and I
like this color a lot it's light enough
to go really up high towards the brow
and it blends out very very well so I'm
just focusing this a little bit above my
crease really kind of towards the brow
leaving a little bit for highlight and
just making sure I blend everything out
I do want to say this eyeshadow look
starts to look messy at a certain point
but I promise you just stay with it and
there will be fine promise you because
when I was doing this tutorial I almost
quit and I almost started over but I was
like no suck it up go ahead and finish
it and honestly I love the way it turned
out so just keep that in mind when
you're doing this it looks a little
messy but it will turn out okay
so now I'm going to take that warm brown
and I'm putting this into the crease
below that transition shade and also
fluffing it into the outer V then I want
to add a little bit of warmth so I took
this orange color and I just topped it
right over that Brown because I just
wanted more warmth into it and I just
wanted to be a little bit more rich so I
just wanted to put this on top of that
Brown we had just put on taking that
black we're going to go ahead and carve
out our crease I don't have as much lid
space as I wish I could so I'm gonna
fake that and I'm gonna go above my
crease with this black I'm just going to
carve it out and I'm using an elf brush
I think this is the eyeliner brush or
something like that it's a really good
brush to do this with and then I'm going
to take a pencil brush and I'm just
going to what blend this apps I think
I'm using the brown color in the puppy
but you can blend this black with
anything just make sure you blend it out
then I'm going in with a fluffy blending
brush with no product and I'm just going
to blend out the edges just so they're
not super harsh because my right eye
which is what you're seeing now was
pretty harsh and I needed to go in and
blend out those lines the best thing
about this Urban Decay palette is it
does blends very very easily that's why
I love it and it's just so much fun to
work with so now it's the best part I'm
gonna take concealer you can use
whatever you want
this Tarte one did not crease on me that
could be because I have a bomb-ass
eyeshadow primer underneath but I
figured I would tell you if my primer
and concealer they did not crease I've
always been scared to do this but I've
been trying it out lately and I've loved
the way that it looks so it just makes
your cut crease really pop that's why
you can be a little bit more messy with
the black because you're gonna go in
with this concealer and you're gonna
carve it out so you can see right here I
messed up and went over the black a
little bit but that's fine because you
can just take the brush that you used
with the black and just go over that to
really sharpen it all out but the
concealer is great because a you get to
have a nice base for the matte eyeshadow
you're gonna put on and be because it
really cleans everything up and gives
you that sleek bomb cut crease look I
have obsessed with this technique I
think it's the easiest way to go
so again I'm doing the same thing on the
other side and I'm going to take this
vanilla color in the palette and I'm
going to set that concealer and once you
do this this is like the cherry on top
of the cake it looks so good it doesn't
look super messy and at this point you
can just go in and clean up any edges
you can blend things out and then these
should be good it's a pretty easy
technique to do it does take a little
bit of practice and it looks a little
messy when you start but it is such a
great technique now I'm going in with my
eyeliner this is the makeup forever
matte liquid liner and I was gonna do a
subtle wing and then it just got intense
so I was like alright you know what
we're just gonna we're gonna work with
it so um I got a really intense wing
going on and now we're gonna move on to
face I did use my velour lashes and
fluff and wispy you guys might love them
and I'm using this Smashbox Studios skin
a foundation with the Real Techniques
diamond sponge
I love the diamond sponge if you want to
see this sponge in action with some
other weird ones I will leave it in a
card in this video so you can check that
out I love the coverage that this gives
and I love the foundation
so now I'm going in with a tart shape
tape concealer again and I'm just going
to put this underneath my eyes and down
the center of my face to highlight we're
going to take the flower Beauty powder
and elbow one and we're going to set
everything and let that fake and then we
move on to brows and I just went ahead
and filled in my brows to kind of save
time with this video I did use the
benefit cut brow and I also use the
benefit 3d brow tones to highlight them
and set them in place
after that we are just going to just the
way the baking while I do this I like to
Dustin it over the rest of my face that
I did where I did not have powder just
so the whole makeup look is set then I'm
going in with my Neutrogena Healthy Skin
bronzer in number 30
I love this you guys already know of
wearing this thing out I filmed a new
drugstore video today and I found
another bronzer that I really love so I
can't wait to share with you guys and
this visitors formula bronzer is great
for contouring it's way too dark for me
to bronze with but to have it as a
contour it is absolutely amazing and I
think if you have darker skin tone as
well I think you would really love this
bronzer it blends out very very well and
to apply the contour I am using this elf
brush I don't know what it's called but
it's from ELF
then I'm just gonna go ahead and blend
that out and for blush I wanted
something nice and neutral so I went
with this Tarte risque blush it's one of
my favorites I think it does it so many
times but it's a great matte blush and
it just adds a nice rosy pop to the
cheeks
then we're gonna blend that out and
apply highlight you already know it's
gonna be wet a wild zoos boozy brunch
it's a great highlight you guys get your
hands on it if I can find it online I
will link it down below it's the best
affordable highlight ever I love this
stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and apply
that to my face and then we're going to
highlight underneath the brow but we're
gonna use the shade from the urban decay
ultimate Naked basics palette Brittany
is the shade that we use all over the
lid underneath our brow just to
highlight that area it does have a sheen
to it
so I don't know why they say it's matte
but it's definitely not fully a matte it
does have like a sheen to it
I'm gonna take my eyeliner and I'm gonna
line my eyes then I'm gonna stop about
half way that way it's really gonna open
up the inner corner of the eye and then
I'm gonna take any matte black eyeshadow
and I'm going to just trace that liner
on my lower lash line again keeping it
more from the center of the eye all the
way out to the outer corner not going
into the inner corner keep that inner
corner nice and bare it makes your eyes
look a little bit bigger a little bit
more open and I really liked it for this
look so I'm going to use that warm brown
color with a pencil brush and blend this
out just so we don't have any harsh
lines make sure you connect everything
to the wing of your winged liner because
go a lot cleaner and I did go ahead
after I applied mascara and touched up
my lash glue my eyeliner I'm using the
duo clear lash glue so I always always
always have to remember to go back over
my eyeliner so I did do that now I'm
taking this candy apple lip liner from
Palladio I'm just going to line my lips
and then I'm taking boss a little of the
same boss liquid lipstick from Smashbox
this was the Lily collab and I love this
it is the perfect red you guys you want
a perfect red this is the perfect red so
I'm just applying this all over my lips
letting that dry and then you are
completely done with this look so I hope
you enjoyed it thank you guys so much

a thumbs up and share it if you liked it
and I'll see you all in my next slide
