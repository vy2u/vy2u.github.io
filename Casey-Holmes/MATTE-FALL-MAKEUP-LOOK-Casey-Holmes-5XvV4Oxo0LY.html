be filming another fall makeup look I
promise I will do a my eyebrows are
crazy I was kind of feeling a dramatic
fall look I kind of looked up some inspo
and I have this tartlet toasted palette
so I wanted to play with this as well
and yeah I'm just gonna do something a
little bit dramatic in here anyways if
you want to see this kind of dramatic
well this okay kind this dramatic fall
makeup look then let's just go ahead and
get started so when you use the tartlet
toasted palette and the first shade that
I'm going to take I'm going to use the
shade s'more right here and I'm just
gonna put that all over the lid to set
our primer using this Smashbox blurring
concealer brush I have two of these I
have one for eyes shadow and then one
for a concealer also if you're wondering
where this top is from it is from my
online clothing boutique and called
Rosie day so the look that I saw online
was pretty dramatic it was mostly matte
which I have not done like a full matte
fall makeup look yet so that's what I'm
gonna do
I'm gonna be using the shade latte and
warmth these two I'm gonna mix them
together and throw these into the crease
anyways I've just been super busy with
that online boutique I'm filming some
videos now just doing pre filming and
trying to make sure I have content up
for you guys because I'm pretty much
down in Georgia most of the time running
it helping to you know make sure
everything is good to go and at some
point I hope you back up here for the
most part but I'm definitely coming back
in for just because I really need to
film videos I know that like me not
filming all the time is temporary but
yeah bear with me for this month this
month is busy with there's so much going
on and you will see why just go with us
so I'm gonna take this dark purple right
here with the flat brush this is the Mac
242 and wow that's pigmented and I'm
just going to take this on woah
that is pigmented it is on my lid and
drag it up to the crease on the eye I
feel like it doesn't look as purple
could just be me okay so now that we
have that on I'm gonna take a another
brush I'm gonna use the shade cozy to
blend that out in the crease it's just
- 17 so I'm going a little bit on the
lid and in the crease - belén this out
because we can always touch up the lid
color but I wanted to see if this will
blend nicely into the crease these
colors are really pretty together I mean
I love warm palettes I think we all know
that actually gonna go in a little bit
with that purple and try to also throw
that in the crease to help deepen it up
a little bit more alright I'm going back
in with the - transition shades warmth
and latte I'm just going over this I to
blend the edges one thing I will say
it's like the purple is pretty but it's
not like what I expected I figured it
would be more purple purple on the lid
to me it's just looking very muted so
I'm just gonna stop there
okay and now I'm gonna go in with liner
it's gonna use my makeup forever ink
eyeliner and I'm gonna do a wing because
I love winged liner
so right now I'm just cleaning up the
edges of the eyeshadow so we just have
that liner my adds sunset here in the
inner part whenever we do our face
makeup just to add a little bit of
something but for the most part this is
what we got going for us so I'm gonna
take a quick break from eyes and we move
on to face cuz I'm gonna apply lashes a
little bit later but I'll do that when I
do my brows I'm going to use my regular
primers and I'm finally gonna try out
this Catrice HD coverage foundation it
says it last stuff it lasts up to 24
hours and it's mattifying with a second
skin effect so I'm fair enough that I
feel like I could dry it so what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna use smashbox
primer water my skin so dry right now
you guys because I ran out of
moisturizer I've been so bad and
actually not when I was in the door like
I ran out of moisturizer so when I was
in Georgia I went and got some Jergens
but it does not moisturize my skin like
my locs eat on one and my skin really
needs moisture so now I gotta figure out
a way to go get some luck seat on body
butter and get my skin back to normal
okay so like I said I'm gonna use this
foundation right here I'm gonna use the
shade warm beige just gonna mix it up
real quick I don't know if I should
apply this with a brush or a sponge but
I'm gonna try a brush first I'm just
gonna kind of press it in and my redness
in the areas where I'm really need
coverage I find that if I don't press in
right here at my cheeks I don't get as
much coverage so when I've been using a
brush I've been trying to do that so I
kind of do it for my forehead as well I
don't really use a lot of product on my
forehead because I don't really need to
grease also has these transforming drops
so you can lighten or darken a
foundation I love these I have a dark
main one by NYX I have like a warm one
and Olive one so I love these and I
can't wait to try them out so I am going
to use this wet and wild highlight and
conceal stick so the first thing I'm
going to do is apply a little bit of
tart shaped tape and a light
'i'm just around my dark areas right
here and then also my nose because i
like to put this so my nose and i'm
going to use this brush to blend it out
it's really hard for me to use anything
else because this is just so full
coverage and it lasts all day long i'm
just gonna put this right underneath
here and then i am gonna take a smaller
brush so many's it cosmetics blurring
concealer and i'm gonna go right in here
into the inner corner with this
concealer because we really want to
right in that area up since we are doing
such a dramatic look you don't want this
inner corner you see that darkness right
in there you don't want that to be there
so we're just gonna go in and take any
excess product in that inner corner just
to really brighten it up that's done and
now I'm gonna take the wet-and-wild
dual and did contour stick looks like
this in the packaging I've had this in
my drawer forever so I thought I would
use it and we have the contour side and
then oh this is a very light highlight
size so I'm just gonna use a little bit
of this since we did pretty much conceal
with the concealer here so I'm just
gonna put this here my forehead whew
that is highlighted
do you think you it blends pretty well
not the best I feel like but it's not
bad I just feel like it looks a little
bitch drying on my forehead but so the
highlights definitely too light for me
but we'll just go in with the contour
now I'll just blend this out
I will say I think I like the cushion
contour a little bit better from wet
wild this is it bad it just takes a
minute to blend out I don't think I
really like that I like it better with
like a stiffer brush cuz it blends it
out easier try that out it's not my
favorite at least the highlight side is
not my favorite I don't think I'll use
the highlight again on me but the
contour isn't bad so now I'm just gonna
set my face with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder stuff is so nice now
we're moving on to the Smashbox contour
palette this one's in the shade
light/medium they also have a medium
dark as well but I'm gonna go in with
the warm tone shade and I'm just going
to bronze my skin with this such a nice
warm tone bronzer for all over the face
it's just one of my favorites blends out
really well I've been using this for so
long now it's really nice look at that
well Ron okay and then I'm going to take
the more ashy side and I'm gonna contour
with this we are contoured or sure I'm
just gonna go in and blend it out we're
just a serious blending right here just
make sure everything kind of melts
together I'm gonna just a little bit of
this underneath my eyes just to brighten
up a tad bit more so really nice powder
because it brightens you up but it
doesn't like you see how much brighter
this looks it brightens you up it
doesn't make you look cakey at all like
I love this powder now we're going to
highlight I'm gonna use this hourglass
metallic strobe lightening palette I
have not tried like hourglass
highlighters I'm sorry kidding but there
we go I haven't tried hourglass
highlighters in I don't know how long
and they only really had those
highlighters that were like kind of
subtle right I mean those are the only
ones that I remember I could be wrong
but i swatched these when I first got
them in PR and I was like oh my god
these are really pretty so this is what
I'm gonna use today so I'm just gonna
use this with my highlighting brush from
Smashbox because I want to see what it
looks like
I definitely if the highlighter is more
intense for our glass but for me it's
not that intense I am going to go in
just a little bit with my spotlight
palette in pearl pop this on as well now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
off camera I'm going to do my eyebrows
and then also put on false lashes and
I'll be back and we will finish up this
all make up love I cannot get my brows I
like them okay we're just gonna move on
so now I'm going to use some of these
cargo cosmetics swimmable eye pencils
and I'm just going to use the black one
in here this is like a gift set from
cargo
it's a really nice eyeliner now we're
going back into the toasted palette and
I'm gonna take the purple with this flat
definer brush I'm gonna push this up
against that lower lash line connect it
to the wing we're kind of going a little
bit far underneath our lashes so I'm
gonna mix cozy and warmth and we're just
gonna blend out the edge of that
you know the mixture of sunset and
candle so this one's sunset this one's
candle I'm going to mix the two and put
those in the inner corner whoo
that is pretty it's kind of glittery but
it's really nice like I think it's
candle that's pretty glittery then I'm
gonna highlight the brow bone with that
same candle color so I'm gonna put a
little mascara on my bottom lashes this
is the wet and wild bottom lash mascara
so I went in and filled in my brows just
a little bit with my makeup revolution
brow pomade I think I'm gonna go back to
pomades
even though I do like brow pencil just
brow pomade czar my thing I can do it
like quicker make them look a little bit
better and then for lips I did put on
cowboy by L'Oreal just because I feel
like it went a little bit better was a
little more warm toned yeah thank you
all so much for watching I really hope
you enjoyed it and I will see you guys
in my next video
