we're actually going to be trying out
something super interesting and I'm
hoping that this works I mentioned this
in my Sephora haul and I just wanted to
try it out on camera with you guys this
is a cover FX custom blot drops oil
control and basically it says custom
block drops allow you to customize your
favorite beauty products to have a matte
finish one drive at a time your product
is weightlessly transform to help
control shine and keep your skin looking
and naturally matte and you're just
going to want to shake it well add
desired amount to any product mix and
apply also can be worn alone under
makeup or over makeup as a touch-up
product throughout the day over makeup
throughout the day that's interesting so
I wanted to test this out with a new
foundation that I just got and this is a
L'Oreal infallible Pro glow so it says
it's a 24 hour wear I've heard so many
people talk about this I figured it'd be
the perfect foundation to try with this
to do like one side with just the pro
glow one side with cover FX mixed in to
see if it does help mattify way I see
people using this is putting it in their
favorite foundations that are just a
little too luminous and a little too
glowy
because they still love the finish of
that foundation they just want something
that will last better if you have like
oily skin or something so we're gonna
see if these two mixed together the only
shade I could find a Sun beige so we're
gonna make it work you know we just got
to make it work I know this videos about
this but I just have to say I love the
packaging of this I think it's so pretty
and sleek and I'm actually gonna do like
a first impression style test it out
Thursday so I'll be going throughout the
day giving you guys updates letting you
know what I think if I'm still matte or
not if it does make it matte we don't
know yet I will be keeping you guys
updated throughout the day and the times
and all of that so that should be fun so
this product is $42 you get one fluid
ounce and it has three point like two
stars it's not exactly 3.5 so I'm gonna
give it like a three point two so this
is what the packaging looks like it's
kind of like a light green it's really
sleek and pretty and I have liner all
over my fingers so I'm sorry and I'm
just going to go ahead and do one side
of my face with this foundation and then
we're going to mix them after I do that
like I said I've heard so many people
say great things about the foundation
but I have her
like it is luminous and it is definitely
for people with normal to dry skin but
you know being oily I know you guys want
me to try stuff like this out just to
see if it could work I'm gonna do this I
would just the foundation we're gonna
kind of so you want to think about this
right off the bat to the strong smell to
it so if you need my channel I have very
oily skin wow this looks really pretty
on the skin it's hard for me to try too
many products if they're not mattifying
it's just really hard for me to work
with them I also have really sensitive
skin I have rosacea as most of you know
wow that covered really well honestly
it's not like to do either I'm actually
impressed by that
but I'm always down to try new things so
far just like with first impression I
like this one better than the matte one
it looks more like skin this is a great
way to kind of see if the foundation
will last longer and if you'll stay
matte a lot longer that's why I wanted
to kind of play with this but what we're
gonna do is we're just going to take a
couple drops like that it does have like
a squeezy pump thing I don't know what
you call this but I love stuff like this
because I just like to play with it and
then when you twist to close it
automatically twists the top down so it
doesn't like to spill everywhere which
is awesome that's what it looks like
it's just like a clear gel looking thing
I'm just going to mix the foundation of
course it doesn't like alter the color
anything since it is clear it is thicker
now it was pretty runny but now it's
pretty thick even though I did just
swirl it over my hand it was pretty
pretty thin so I'm just going to put
this all over my face okay so we pretty
much have the same coverage I need to
mix up a little bit more I want to see
if this is like a little bit buildable
since it is more of a matte finish so I
have to say right off the bat you don't
see a ton of different by the way I
think that's color matches pretty well I
got lucky with that one I always set my
makeup with powder shoe you know what I
forgot I forgot primer I got too excited
but I did use a moisturizer that is
mattifying so now that I'm looking at I
do see more of a satin finish over here
there's still a little bit of a glow but
there's definitely more glow over here
and like in my nose area I'm going to go
ahead and finish rest my face with my
concealer on everything like that we'll
come back and see if we see a difference
with if it's mattifying and then we're
also going to see you throughout the day
if this side can stay more matte than
this side so I'll be right back I'm
gonna go put on the rest of my face okay
okay pause for the first time ever
filming videos I realize I have lipstick
all by teeth so don't judge me just love
me okay now back to the video so I'm
officially done with my makeup I've been
done for like 20 minutes I've been
taking selfies in my real life but I'm
officially done and I have to say like
right off the bat right now I don't see
a huge difference between this side and
this side so like I said we are going to
go throughout the day and see if this
side stays more mad than this side
hopefully it helps like with the
longevity of it staying matte and I
don't have to blot as much on this side
so that is kind of like the key thing
now this side blended just as well as
this side so even though this one kind
of had a little bit more of a satin
finish it did blend very very well
sometimes I feel like with satin
foundations products will sit there for
a couple seconds and then they'll be too
hard to really blend out that was not an
issue with this side whatsoever its 306
I'll listen to Pandora before I got back
on here and really quickly I do want to
say I have on on-demand lipstick with
the on Nastasia Kristin lip gloss if
you're wondering I'm going to go ahead
and go throughout my day I might
incorporate my blog camera in this we
will see and I will see you guys in
disagreement hey guys so right now it is
five-o to try to show you
Cannell uc-davis like looking all my
stuff but it's 5:02 and so it's been
about two hours now I just made it to
Atlanta I always seem to update when I'm
in Atlanta looking at the foundation
right now honestly it doesn't look any
different I feel like I could totally
add a little bit of powder just because
I'm a little shiny I'm gonna try go a
little bit longer without doing that I
actually have to pee really bad so I'm
fidgeting I'm sorry I was in later
traffic and then I have to pee so
anyways I'm a little shiny but honestly
I still don't see a huge difference
between one side the other maybe this
sign is just a little bit more matte
than this one but it's not by much at
all honestly that's what we're doing and
I will see you guys in just a couple
Albert hey guys so it's now 6:18 only
been at Phipps for an hour um but I have
to say I only blot once
and I you know I haven't had two pounder
which is crazy but this is really
setting on my skin really well again I
don't notice a huge difference between
the Matt coverfx drops and the original
just like lore'l foundation another
thing to keep in mind I haven't used a
primer at all I usually use a mattifying
primer when I use any sort of foundation
but I did for this one I mean I probably
could use a little bit but I'm still
trying to go strong and see which side
gets the most oily so other than the
fact that I did a lot once I literally
just took a tissue to my face like this
I just don't see like a really big
difference and all I think both sides
look equally great I'm starting to think
that the cover FX drops are not really
going to make a difference because I
haven't so far I still have a few more
hours to go we'll see I'm gonna try to
not blah or anything for the rest of the
night and we'll see what side gets a
little bit more oily but honestly
there's on that big of a difference so
maybe you could save your money and not
worry about it going to our next stop
and then we'll be headed home and if I
don't get some food I'm gonna be hangry
I love being hungry does anybody do that
to themselves like you'll go shopping
and you just don't eat it's not a good
combo so on to the next one all the
skyline looks beautiful hey guys I'm
gonna do a quick update it's 8:02 I
really need some powder on my face like
it is so Willie again there's not a
difference between the sides I feel like
both sides are equally as oily this one
is not matte or anything like that so
let me show you the time it's not really
an update and I'll show you the time
right on a busy but it's 8:02 and I'm
gonna put some powder on I should blot
but of course I don't have any of a
blotting stuff and if you're wondering
where I'm at I'm at Taco Bell hey guys I
want to try the Cinnabon delights is
what I want to try oh my god I love this
powder by the way you guys like if you
haven't had a chance to try this powder
you really need to it's amazing
that's all powdered up looks much better
now I've needed a powder for a hot
minute but like I said not a huge
difference with each side I think this
is kind of just like a gimmicky product
you could try it on without foundation
um like before your foundation but I
would much rather just mix it in with my
foundation just a you skip a step of
applying it and then applying foundation
and B I feel like mixing it in with the
foundation kind of like should work you
know
I'm gonna do this I'm probably gonna do
one more update for the day and then
I'll be done so yeah I will see you guys
in a few hours
hey guys so I am currently filming a few
videos right now but I wanted to end
this video because I didn't end this
video on the day that I filmed it
because after I ate those Cinnabon
delights girl uh was sick as a dog and I
did film a clip at the very end of the
night when I was so sick but like it's
so low energy and it just I look
terrible honey I look terrible I want to
say I didn't notice a huge difference
with the cover FX mixed in with like a
luminous foundation I mean maybe if you
put it in with your mattifying
foundation but it's just not as mad as
you want it to be maybe it'll work but
honestly it didn't work for me
I personally won't use any more and I
feel like I'm going to return it now I
know a lot of people probably want me to
try it out as a blotting thing because
that's what you can use if we can use it
to blot or whatever might try it out and
just give you guys an update in my June
is it gonna be June is your life and my
July hits misses I will update you on
that in that video but to be a hundred
percent honest and real with you that's
not something that I would take with me
on the go to touch up with I would much
rather just use my Maybelline powder
that is a lot cheaper than that then to
use that specific product just for
blotting since it obviously didn't work
mixing it with foundation I would much
rather save that money and carry a
powder with me it's much more convenient
and easy I don't have to look to you
know powder my face I just wanted to
come on here and quickly say that but
for me this product was kind of a bust I
did like the L'Oreal foundation it's
just a little too luminous that's
something I'm gonna have to try and more
of the fall and winter months when it's
super cold outside so yeah that was my
first impression of the cover ethics
matte drops I'm gonna return mine I'm
gonna try the blotting method before I
return it to let you guys know if it
does work in my June keep saying June
and my July hits and misses just so you
know if it does work or not so I am
going to try it out this next week
because next week I'm filming my July
hits and misses anyways
so it'll be good for me to use it from
here on out until I film that video and
since I'm filming this right now I just
got done a filming my DIY pizza
highlighter that's going to be in my
next test
Thursday so this coming up Thursday
Dibble look out for this because we're
gonna see if it worked and all of the
above so Pizza highlight coming for you
