my Jennifer March April May favorites I
I still cannot believe it is June it's
so crazy so anyways I am here to show
you guys all the products I've been
loving and I'm also going to share with
you my music favorites so I'm really
excited I'm in a great mood I'm sorry
for the minimal makeup I didn't really
put a lot of effort into it if you've
been following my blog channel you know
every time I wear makeup this month it's
usually with this look it's a really
minimal foundation well it's not minimal
but it's lighter than what I would
usually do especially for the eyes so
this is just when I go to look so I'm
sorry I didn't put a lot of effort into
it but I promise you I will be doing
that more in this month I feel like this
past month if I don't have makeup on I
don't have enough time to put a little
bit extra makeup on you know I'm saying
so yeah if you guys would see all the
products I've been loving then let's
just get into it
ok so first I'm going to talk about
lashes in the first pair of lashes I've
been loving are these Koko lashes and
Goddess these have to be my favorite
from the brand I mean they're just so
beautiful and every time I wear them I
get tons of compliments so this is what
they look like they're just super fluffy
and pretty and I'm just in love with
them and then the last ones I've been
really enjoying our Ariel these ones are
a little bit more spiky but I promise
you they look so gorgeous on lash just
feeling really good so if I had to
recommend one though it would be goddess
cuz they're beautiful okay so the next
product is something I kind of bashed
when I first got it but now I'm like
really loving it it is these Smashbox a
photo finish primer water and I have
never been a believer in all of these
sprays that are out you know like the
Urban Decay send sprays and things like
that they never worked for me but this
one is just so nice I have been using
this and then I'll spray this all over
my face and then I'll go in with my
makeup forever step one a face mattifier
and I will put this on in just the areas
that I'm oily and my foundation goes on
so beautifully and lasts all day
like it it doesn't take a lot to get
this on your face and I've used quite a
bit of it so I'm just I'm so in love
with it it's it's really good stuff so
if you've been thinking about it getting
it I would definitely recommend it
because I think it's cool and I think
they have I know they have smaller
versions of you make up forevers primer
but I'm not sure about this primer water
if they do get this water size test it
out see if it works for your skin and
then I would move on but for me I have
just been enjoying this like crazy I
only spray it before my makeup I've
never spray it on after my makeup okay
next up is a new foundation that I've
been using over Estee Lauder like I'm
obsessed that I'm obsessed with it I
don't know if it's out yet because Too
Faced did send this to me and we'll be
doing a video with it the next video I
plan on putting up is a get ready with
me so you'll be seeing it in that video
in action but this is the Too Faced Born
This Way absolute perfection foundation
and this is oil free I'm wearing it
right now and the other day I went
shopping and I wore this foundation with
this minimal makeup and I had so many
compliments I even walked into Sephora
at Lenox and they were just
complimenting my makeup and I was like
love this foundation it is so beautiful
on the skin lasts all day and I'm
telling you it just looks flawless with
a Beauty Blender like I'm obsessed I
can't so it does have a pump and there
are quite a bit of shades in the range
the one that I am when I'm nice to self
hand is warm beige and it's just
beautiful it's I mean it looks like
beautiful skin and it covers amazingly
for me it is full coverage and I just I
love it I do have to set my face with a
powder later on throughout the day I
don't
I thought only time I set my face when I
first do my makeup is underneath my eyes
where I put concealer but throughout the
day I do have to take a powder and just
kind of touch up a translucent one but
that's all I have to do and I'm good to
go so I love this highly recommend it I
even wore sunglasses and didn't really
have hardly any sunglass marks because
it just stayed on so well then moving on
to the peridot
I have been sending with it is this G
Vaughn she matte translucent finishing
powder I love this so incredibly much I
keep this in my purse which is why I
haven't shown it in a video lately just
because it like lives in my purse it
goes with me everywhere because if I
need to powder I will use this and it
just gives me a really matte but smooth
finish it's just it's so beautiful it
doesn't look overly matte and cakey and
gross
it is so worth somebody that you spend
on it not even kidding so I just keep my
puff in here which I should probably
clean I should figure out how to clean
that I don't know but I keep my puff in
here for when I'm on the go and then it
already has a little bit on here so I
just like to scrape some of it off or
tap it off and then put it on my face
and just Pat it in and it's it's so good
I love this I would never tell you buy
this expensive of a powder if it wasn't
amazing okay next up is a bronzer I've
been using I've been using a new contour
palette but I'm gonna tell you about
that real soon I'm not gonna tell you in
this video but I will post a video about
it very soon I don't know if anybody
else has talked about it but it's coming
for ya and I'm really excited about it
so but this is a bronzer I've been using
a ton lately I went back to this this is
the Smashbox bronze light skin
perfecting bronzer in Sun Tan matte it
is just the most beautiful warm bronzer
ever it is completely matte it's so
smooth and just I mean so stunning on
the skin it blends like a dream that's
it right there
blends like a dream and I I just love it
I love it I love it I love it
so very soft like I said really easy to
work with I would check out Smashbox
bronzers if you are wanting to pick up a
new one I actually love the packaging of
this I love the screw on top okay now
for an eyeshadow like I told you guys
I've been doing this look at unlight
leaves it's basically what I've been
wearing every single day if I wear
makeup but this eyeshadow when this came
in from makeup geek I was like that is
mine that is my shade this is in desert
sands and it's a really pretty mustard
color I mean it
stunning but this reminds me so much of
Bobby Brown's camel it's just a cheaper
alternative and it is stunning stunning
and if you have brown eyes so pretty I
feel like with my dark hair tan skin and
dark eyes this really just I don't know
it's something about dark features that
I feel like it just looks beautiful I
have it on right now and I just I love
it it looks so it doesn't look like you
have eyeshadow on you know what I'm
saying and I've also been loving this
brush to apply with hands-down best
blending brush ever I need like ten of
these maybe even 20
okay that's excessive but I need a lot
of them this is the morphe m51 3 this is
a really great dupe for the Mac 217 and
the thing I love about this more than
any of the other blending brushes even
the ones from Sigma everything is it has
a tapered end so I I have not had a
white-haired a blending brush that had a
tapered end ever and I feel like this
just blends perfectly it takes the
product right where you want it so I
like to go right above my crease with
this makeup geek desert sands and I'll
just put it right above the crease so
easy just to get right into that crease
and blend it out it's a nice per size
blending brush but not too precise it
puts the product where you want it
instead of blending it all over the
place you know what I'm saying I have
been using it every time that I wear
makeup I love it and actually have an
affordable makeup tutorial coming for
you guys really soon I'm so excited
about that I filmed and this is
definitely in that video so you'll see
it in action but I just oh my god I love
it it's amazing you have to have this
brush in your life or mascara I have
been going between these two I adore the
L'Oreal miss manga mascara I think this
is amazing is what I have with my lashes
right now I love this house kara I
always go back to it but for high-end
I've also been loving at the benefit
roller lash this gives you a false lash
effect and it's just it's really great
I've never liked a benefit mascara
before and I'm
that's what this one so it definitely
definitely definitely check this out if
you don't want to splurge go with Lori
Oh miss manga because I mean my lashes
look amazing and they always stay cold
like this but I've been going back and
forth with both of these and I love them
okay so the last category is lip
products and I only have three if you've
been watching my vlog channel I've had
quite a bit of people ask me about my
lip color and it's gonna be one of these
two so this one I used to talk about all
the time
it's the lorac Pro I have hair just all
over this so this is a lorac pro matte
lip color and pink taupe again I used to
wear this all the time and I just found
it again and I started using it so that
pink taupe it's very beautiful a great
everyday color and it doesn't dry out
your lips it's just stunning and it
smells like MAC lipsticks which is
amazing and then I've also been using
this bite Beauty in glaze this one's so
pretty as well this one has kind of more
of a glossy feel to it and there's a
little bit darker but they are both
beautiful for everyday and they both
last a really long time so I love these
I love the stick form and I just again
keep these in my purse and touch up on
the go and then the last lipstick I
actually have been loving all of the
Maybelline lipsticks that I purchased
from Target I did a drugstore makeup off
if you haven't checked it out I'll link
it down below but I got like three of
the Maybelline lipsticks and I love all
of them and I can't find two of them I
think they're in my purse because I have
been using them non-stop but I have this
one on my desk and I love this one as
well this is touchable taupe and it's
just a topi nude and it is so beautiful
I freaking love Maybelline lipsticks I
think they're amazing they look amazing
on the lips they feel amazing if they
last for a really long time and I just
love it they're affordable you really
can't beat it so these new like nude
Maybelline lipsticks are so good the
other two I think that I think the other
two are one of them that I have is a
matte nude and then the other ones
news like this as well so I will try to
find them and if I can't I'll leave
their names down below but touchable
taupe is a really really nice way as
well okay and now I'm going to move on
to a self-tanner I have been loving this
still the loving tan self-tanner a lot
of people ask me when I go back to if
you've watched me for a really long time
I was addicted to beauty Liberata
I still love Vita Liberata but for me it
doesn't last as long as I wish it would
I have to do this probably once a week
whereas with vanilla Parata I would do
like 2 to 3 times a week which is kind
of excessive but I just like a really
dark tan so I love this one this is the
deluxe bronzing mousse and ultra dark I
only use ultra dark I will not use
anything less because I don't feel like
there's a point in self-tanning if I'm
not going to be dark so this one's
really great but my all-time favorite is
the 2 hour Express if you are on the go
and need a self tan like ASAP the two
hour Express is amazing I used it right
before I like to shake he moves is fun
and I didn't have enough time to do it
the night before so I did it earlier in
the morning and then took a shower after
about two hours and I had a really nice
tan so I'll leave a picture right here
so you can see how tan I was but I loved
it it saved my life something because I
needed the tan with some shorts because
I haven't been on this done at all so
far love these they're amazing if you
have the time definitely get this one
the deluxe bronzing mousse if you don't
have a lot of time or you just don't
want to wait 8 hours for your Tay to
develop definitely get to our one I've
mentioned them quite a few times within
the past few months and I just love it I
have coupons and stuff for you guys down
below if you're interested ok so the
next thing I want to talk about are
perfumes I'm mentioning too because if
you can't find this one this one's just
as great so this is the flora by Gucci
oh my gosh this is like a light mint
green color it looks clear on camera but
the it's like a it's like a light green
type of shade I'm very nice this smells
so good oh my god I got this like last
summer it smells so good I got the wrong
bottle at first I got one I was like a
pinky water but this one with the blue
Green type of thing it is so good if you
can find it you need to get it again it
is four by Gucci if they don't have that
anymore then I recommend this one this
is Dolce by Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana and I really
enjoy this one I would spray something
but I have to leave after this video but
I love this it is so good and I think
the bottle is just adorable like how
cute is that
umm but this is really great I had it as
a mini spray in my purse for a long time
because I would just spray myself with
it when I was out and about but then I
loved it so much that I just got three
full size so Dolce it by Dolce and
Gabanna it's amazing now I told you guys
I've been loving vlogging and i'ma
vlogging a lot so I have been using this
a camera this is a Sony I don't know
what this is I got this at Best Buy I
don't know it's a Sony and it's one of
these it just looks like this it has the
flip up screen and if you watch my vlogs
and you hear the Wiggles it's this these
things I don't know how to get them off
if you know how to get them off please
let me know because they annoy me too
but I actually took a phone screen this
is not the glass protector but you know
like the protectors you could put on
your phone that are just like flimsy I
have that on this because I want to
protect the screen so that's why that
looks like that just so it protects the
screen but I love this it's so fun to go
around I like to hold it like right here
half the time which is probably not good
for it but I hold it there all the time
and I just love it so this camera from
Sony for vlogging has been amazing and I
love the quality of it okay and then the
last thing I'm going to show you guys
our shoes these shoes have been worn out
by me I believe these are from Windsor
or shop hopes I cannot remember where I
got them from I'm thinking shop hopes
but it might be Windsor I'll go look and
see if I can find them but these shoes
are amazing they're the brand I can't
read them I read more them so much d
blossom collection deep de blossom
collection and I love these I wear them
with the laces tied around the center
because I just like boots better like
that I think
they look more casual and fun so ya been
wearing these non-stop aren't they
adorable you can see how the wearing em
in they're so cute and they go with so
many different outfits now it's time for
the favorite part and it's music I made
sure to charge my beats so we could have
the beat because so you taking it back
to the old apartment days right like we
had the beats pill and we would just jam
out and a lot of you ask me where I get
this case I got my case from case if I
actually have another one coming in
because these aren't that protective I
hate to say it they're not that
protective but they're cute and they
make a statement but yeah I have another
case coming in from NC I'm really
excited about anyway he's moving on
we're gonna talk about music so first
one I actually saw the his name is
Michael ray he is a country singer and I
actually saw him when I went to Valdosta
to fork it Moore's concert he like
opened for him so I love this song so
much even before we saw him in concert I
was obsessed with this so it's called
kiss you in the morning by Michael Rea
place is hanging on slightly raised how
it keeps you in
okay my next favorite is flexed by rich
homie Quan and I don't really know the
words to it but I just love the beat of
us moving on I also I'm loving a lot of
country lately
this next song is how I feel about like
love and stuff like that I'm not being
unrelated being single and happy this is
how I feel about love and past
relationships and things like that it's
called love by jana kramer and it's
really really good it's something you
want to listen to all the words because
it's a beautiful song and I saw her
performance shaky boots and it was it
made me love her she's just such a damn
good performer she puts on a show so
again this is love by jana kramer I
still believe in fairy tales
I still believe in picking flour
the reason why I love this song so much
is because you hear so many different
songs nowadays I talk about exes and
like I cannot stand the song girl crush
by Little Big Town I I just can't stand
it I don't like what it's saying in the
song I don't like anything about it but
this song it's so empowering because
it's not talking about a certain text
it's not talking about being depressed
it's saying that she has gone through so
many things in life with love she's been
in in in and our relationships just love
it because it's not pointing out a
specific person it's just saying love
you know I went through how many things
that have tested me to not believe in
true love and to not believe it's out
there but she still believes in it I
think I think it's a beautiful song and
she did such an amazing job with it
hands down one of the best songs with
the best meaning in my opinion okay
let's move it on some fun um I've been
loving these skill racks and Diplo with
Justin Bieber where are you now oh my
god I love Islam
it's so good
okay this song is different this is by
Keith James and it's called not my day
I'm obsessed with this song again it has
a really cool meeting I just I love it I
love it so much you have to listen to it
it's so good not my day
Keith James
this crashing burn by Thomas Rhett I
love this one too it is so freakin good
the world keeps spinning
