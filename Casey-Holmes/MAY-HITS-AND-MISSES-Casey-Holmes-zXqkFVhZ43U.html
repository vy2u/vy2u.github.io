be sharing with you my May hits and
misses
I did not do an April hits and misses I
caught the wrath I promise you I know a
lot of you we're like where is your
April hits and misses I just got too
busy I got too busy I had other things
to film and they were just way too close
together my March and April hits and
misses would have been like back-to-back
almost like maybe a few videos apart I
wanted to wait until the next month to
combine all my favorites we've got a lot
of hits to go through and actually not
that many misses so really excited to
talk to you guys about all these
products and just random things that I
have so yeah if you wanna check out my
hits and misses definitely keep watching
and don't forget to subscribe before you
leave if you're not already and hit that
post notification bell that way you can
be notified every time I upload a video
and I think that's it let's just go
ahead and get started a snap wait really
so let me talk about my first favorites
you guys probably already know this if
you've been watching my videos I have
been loving bandanna I've been growing
my collection
slowly but surely I just got some new
ones in so the one I've been wearing a
lot in my videos is this red one I'm
just gonna play around with my hair this
summer and just kind of see what I can
do with bandanas I also want to start
tying them on my denim so just wait just
like I got ideas I just want to start
playing with bandanas more accessorizing
with them I don't know just something
about them right now I'm feeling it it's
summer I have a red one right here I
also got this one from Target I thought
for a Memorial Day or fourth of July
this would be so cute Tim I have this
green one that I got from Free People
which is like one of my favorites
because I love this color and then I got
this one from it's not sure what seller
it was but they have a lot of really
cute patterns and this is one of the
ones that I got I just thought it was
super cute see this is like really thick
I don't know how I'm gonna make this
work like I look like this is what I'll
probably tie around my denim because I
thought it was gonna be a different type
of fabric you can also use things like
this to tie around your ponytail or
something and moving on to skincare I
have been loving quite a bit of product
so the first product you would have seen
a lot this month is the Dior my seller
milk no rinse cleanser I'm obsessed with
this product it's great it's like you
wake up and you need to go to the gym
but you don't want to wash your face
completely like you just want something
to cleanse it really fast or if you
haven't wear makeup all day and you
don't feel the need to completely rinse
your
face and wash it with water you could
use this and that's why I do a lot of
the times I'll use it before the gym or
if I haven't wore makeup all day this is
how I'll cleanse all you do is put it on
a cotton pad wipe it all over your face
it just cleanses it's moisturizing it's
great for sensitive skin it doesn't
write me out it doesn't make my redness
flare-up I just love that it cleanses
the skin and you don't have to rinse it
off lazy girls unite I will say I don't
take off my entire makeup with this like
I wouldn't use it for this right here
because a it's expensive and B I feel
like I would have to use a lot of
product to really get all this off but
if I had just some brow products and
some primer on I would use it to get
that off I really like this a lot so so
so much it's just really easy to use I
have been loving which if you guys saw
my Sephora haul you saw this but is the
belief moisturizing eye ball this is so
good you guys this is very moisturizing
for your under eyes this makes your
under-eye concealer look like 10 times
better I'm not kidding when your under
eyes are nice and moisturized everything
just looks better your skin just looks
better when you really take care of it
it all starts from skincare and I love
this product at first I was like I'm
gonna use this only at night then I
started using it in the day and I was
like dang my concealer looks good so you
know now I use it day and night it's
good because a little bit really does go
a long way you don't need a ton of this
to moisturize your eyes and it really
keeps your eyes hydrated for such a long
time so one of my favorites absolutely
love it if you're looking for a new eye
cream this is good I've been using a new
cleanser this month and I have been
enjoying this so so so much this is the
origins checks and balances frothy face
wash and it says it's a gentle face wash
that cleanses both dry and oily places
broadleaf kelp extract discourages
excess oil production wheat protein
bounces Andra protects dry prone zones
and skin fills comfortably refresh after
cleansing never tight pulled or parched
I 100% agree with that my skin feels so
good after I use this it doesn't feel
like I put a lot of cleanser on my face
because I usually cleanse my face twice
to make sure I got everything completely
off and it really doesn't feel stripped
at all I mean this is such a great great
product do you use this day and night
mostly in the nighttime though because
sometimes I'll use an exfoliating
cleanser in the daytime and I've just
been really enjoying this it does kind
of get a little frothy it's really
nicely great for sensitive skin doesn't
we break out I feel like if anything it
just really plumps up the skin keeps it
nice and moisturized I really do feel
like this helps kind of balance my skin
and it's just awesome my skin's are
looking so great using this I have been
using this mask for the past couple
months I don't use it all the time but I
do use it quite a bit when I just really
need something to clean out my pores and
this is so good this is the purity from
philosophy the made simple pore
extractor you're supposed to do is when
you put it on you kind of put it on in
circular motions let it completely dry
it gets super super hard kind of like
the glam glow masks but a little bit
harder than that and you only have to
leave it on for five to ten minutes
which is perfect cuz some masks you have
to leave on for like 20 minutes like I
want to show you but this one's really
great I really feel like it just cleans
the pores pulls everything out and gives
me a nice clean slate again it does not
irritate my skin I think that is key and
it gives me a really gorgeous glow as
well so highly recommend this I have
been really enjoying it last mask is
something that Lancome the what did I
just this last mask is something that
Lancome gifted to me and holy any more
of these these are the lancome genifique
hydrogel melting masks this feels so
good you guys if you just want to relax
and like even if you just use this
product and you want something to really
just plump up your skin and give you a
gorgeous glow on your face to feel super
hydrated and just like you got your
together this is such a great mask I
actually left this on longer than you're
supposed to I left it on probably for
like 45 minutes you can eat you know it
says you can use it for 10 to 30 minutes
and just depending on what you want but
I left it on for a long time so I'll
watch a Riverdale I couldn't get up you
know and this made my skin feel so good
it was very very cooling my skin once I
took it off felt plump the next morning
it's all super refreshed as well and I
have been loving this they only sent me
a few I'm almost out but I think this is
totally worth it I have a feeling that
genifique name that sounds very
expensive so I have a feeling this is
expensive it says globe plump smooth
it's a full on face mask so you don't
have like a separate mask here in here
it's all one and I'm
really enjoying well I'm looking at
right here this other thing I want to
mention is the are no laws low multitask
I see our masks I have been using this a
lot to smuggle it comes with six I only
have two left I've been really enjoying
these if my eyes just need a little
pick-me-up this is where I'll use I love
using it before makeup tutorials because
I really feel like it just plumps up the
skin it gets everything ready I've been
really into skincare lately taking good
care of my skin washing my face every
night not playing myself you know so
I've been really enjoying this and I
feel like it's been a great addition to
my before makeup routine okay so this is
a SPF for your face that I really love
if you have oily skin you're going to
love this too so this is a kula face
mineral sunscreen it's the cucumber
matte finish and it has SPF 30 if you
have oily skin and you want a good SPF
for your face but you find that all of
them are super like greasy I know how it
is I'm the same way a lot of them also
break me out this is the way to go this
is such pretty packaging you can use
this underneath makeup which is great I
mean SPF is good year-round but what I
really love about this is that a it
doesn't break me out Mb it is matte so I
love it it's a nice light weight SPF
actually from the Sun can't go wrong
with that I'm just really enjoying it
and I wanted to mention it to you guys
had to mention this this is the Sonia
Kashuk quick clean dry brush spray I
have mentioned this so much the past
couple months I actually just got the
full-size so say hello so what I like to
do is take a brush spray it and now like
do circular motions on a towel to get
the color off and it is dry like that
you don't have to worry about anything
you can use the same brush over and over
again and switch out the colors and
clean it with this not gonna affect the
eyeshadow whatsoever I really been
enjoying it it's from Target
it's affordable good to have a spot
cleaner like this because you never know
when you need that same perfect brush
that you use for your perfect eye looks
this is good takes all that color out
it's amazing I want to talk about my
face makeup real quick because I have
been loving this foundation again I kind
of just like Saul back in love with it
you know I try out so many things that I
have to go back to it to some points
Foundation is so good it's the Jota Jota
really it's the huda beauty foe filter
high coverage foundation this is a
completely full coverage foundation
there is nothing that's gonna peak
through through this look so great on my
skin I don't know what it is recently I
think maybe because I'm taking much
better care of my skin
I'm drinking lots of water it just looks
really good on top of my skin and on top
of all my primers and I could really
pack this on believe it or not and it
looks dead like it doesn't look but have
it all right now been really enjoying it
again this is a staple for me you guys
know I love full coverage foundations
and I have very oily skin this is good
doesn't break me out it doesn't have
like that powdery matte finish if you
know what I'm saying like when it's
super matte or full coverage it kind of
has that little thickness to it this
does not I find that looks just great on
my skin I am or underneath that I have
been really loving these Smashbox so
chill coconut primer water is smells so
good and it's just perfect for spring
and summer you guys know I love the
primer water can't be without it I
literally do not do my face makeup
without this product so I just wanted to
mention the so chill coconut 1/2 because
is delicious another primer I want to
mention is Smashbox reduce redness
primer you can seriously see the redness
go down and that's why I use this
product if I'm going to the gym and I
don't want a full face of makeup but my
redness is just a little bit too kicked
up for that day I will put this on top
of it and it just takes it down a few
notches and does it make it look as
pigmented and as in Tim it's a very very
green primer and it looks like this but
once you put it into your skin I swear
to you you won't see it at all
another thing I like about this is it's
very poor filling it's not an oily
consistency either it just really works
so well for me like makes my skin look
very smooth does it make me like a
greaseball throughout the day I've been
really loving this especially the other
night I used it with this hourglass
foundation the combo of these two is
just so smooth and insane you guys I
love this one is like the only stick
foundation that I'd go back to over and
over again but I tried it with this
primer and I was like wow another thing
I'm in loving is from k'kaw so I tried
out her concealers and brightening
powders in my April I tried them out in
April and I have been loving them this
one's in the shade 6 this is my like
perfect shade I don't know if you guys
can see in the tube I've used quite a
bit of this stuff
I love the applicator of this it's like
a nice rounded tip and it really just
applies it perfectly underneath the eyes
I like this paired with chart shape tape
because tart shaped tape is more full
coverage so I like it better to come
my dark circles but then I use this one
to brighten in my face you guys know I
usually use two concealers to do that it
doesn't look cakey on the skin
whatsoever it's super smooth and very
brightening that's what I love about it
this thing this is so brightening this
is our brightening powder and this one's
in the shade 3 I also have I think is
shade 4 where it's more of a peachy
shade I love this product so much it
really just brightens up your face I
will say you don't have to buy this I
mean if you wanted a dupe you could get
this essence brighten up powder
basically the same thing this is a lot
more brightening though it just has a
little bit more kick to it but if you
wanted something more affordable
you could definitely try this one out
it's a great product so I like to take
this morphe brush and normally I do this
before I have blush and bronzer on but I
just want to show you guys how like look
at how brightening that it that is
insane it's such a pigmented powder the
powder is so soft and like not cakey
whatsoever I just I love it I love this
powder so much and I love it with this
morphe brush - I really like products
like this for sometimes like if I go in
with my setting powder for underneath my
eyes and it kind of deepens up my
concealer because it kind of just takes
it all away sometimes it'll oxidize and
then you don't really have a highlighted
effect anymore this is a great way to go
back in and add that highlighted effect
to your eyes it's also great if you want
something like super glam in your face
I'm highlighted and contoured this is
good another powder has been this Marc
Jacobs perfecting coconut setting powder
this is so nice I have this on my face
as well today it's just a really smooth
powder I absolutely love the packaging
don't mind how dirty mine is it's
because of this net I have to dig my
sponge into there but I do love the net
packaging I think it is really nice and
yeah I just really love this powder it's
very very smooth and I have been using
this like I've been using this like
crazy I do want to quickly shout out
this Too Faced natural face palette this
is so pretty personal it smells
delicious but I use every shade in this
palette ok hold on no I don't use Tropic
like it's hot very much just like a
shimmery bronzer but I use all these
other shades even this one I used it in
a tutorial the other day and it was
actually very pretty with a light
these two are really beautiful
highlighters this one's definitely a lot
more gold than it looks like when you're
just looking at it I love this blush
this is my kind of color this blush is
really pretty too and I've also been
using this to bronze and contour I did
travel with this as well I traveled
really really well even though it is a
bigger face palette you pretty much have
everything you need in here and it's
just been awesome to use I've been
really enjoying it you guys have seen in
my Instagram followers pic my makeup
this is the makeup revolution soap X
ultra eyeshadow palette this is great
again it's a collab with a youtuber I
love all of these shades so much these
are just my kind of shades you do have a
mixture of mattes and shimmers in here
they are very very pigmented as well
they also blend really well with each
other so I've been really enjoying this
I think it's a great palette again if
you want to see that video I'll link it
down below I used mainly these shades
right here which some of you were like
why are you using those shades again
those were definitely so pretty great
for spring and summer and you have a lot
of great shades to kind of take this
from spring summer to fall winter you
can do a lot with this palette I also
want to shout out this eyeliner from
Marc Jacobs this one's in the shade
brownie this is their gel eyeliner I
love this color for brown eyes there's
just something about it it really
reminds me of Costa reach from matte use
that eyeliner and so long I need to get
it I need to order it because they still
love that eyeliner this just really
makes brown eyes pop just different than
a regular brown eyeliner kind of has
like a little bit of a gold hint to it
but not really it's just a nice like
lighter brown okay moving on to the mrs.
I only have three this month the first
miss is this pixi by petra matte liquid
lip I wanted to love these so bad but
these just do not last on my lips at all
like if I'm gonna wear a matte lipstick
it needs to last all day long that's why
I created those Apple audio because they
literally last through anything they're
so so so good they don't really dry down
that quick like my pull audio ones take
a little bit to dry down but these take
longer and I don't know they just don't
last throughout the day so a little
disappointing but the colors are
beautiful just not my tea so T these are
just not my thing so pass on that also I
cannot I don't like this I didn't like
this at all this is the origins original
skin pore perfecting cooling primer with
willow-herb first office is way too cold
for me
the packaging of it I think it's too
loud I normally don't care too much
about packaging but I just don't like
how loud this is because if I'm doing my
makeup in the morning I'm like it's also
very very cooling I don't feel like it
makes my pores look smaller I don't
think it makes my makeup look any better
if anything I feel like it makes my skin
look a little bit more textured so pass
on this not for me but I do love origins
face wash so go check that decided to
try out this product this is the Lynnae
I'm gonna guess that's what's called eye
sleeping mask and it says it's for all
skin types it is so pretty I mean this
is a very luxurious bottle this is a $48
this feels like it would be like 75
it feels amazing it's like a frosted
glass you open it up and then you have
this little rounded tip to really just
work it into the skin very luxurious and
not too too hot I mean it is a high
price tag don't get me wrong but it's
not as high as what it feels like this
feels very very luxurious but once I got
this this is just so much more
moisturizing it is more expensive than
this one by like $10 this is just so
much more moisturizing than this one so
that's why it's a Miss for me it is
still a really great product but for an
eye mask I expected a little bit more
from it a little bit more moisture and I
got that from this that's why it's a
Miss for me it's not a bad product at
all I just preferred the belief one over
it you know song favorites are my like
absolute favorites and I think it's
y'all's favorites too because it's just
such a casual part of the video that we
just hang out talk about music and what
we like I have to say two of the songs
I'm gonna mention to you guys I have
worn out and now if I hear one of them
online so I'm having to kind of take a
moment and take a step back from playing
it so much but I still love it let's
start with Taylor Swift so I'm really
loving all her music from her reputation
album and this one called don't blame me
I am like so obsessed with it
another one of my favorites from her
reputation album is I did something bad
this just is so good to me and I don't
know I just I feel like making a music
video for the song would be just so fun
and the Tristan narcissist
this song from Kenny Chesney Kyle get
along I haven't really been the biggest
kanae-chan fan for the past few years I
don't know I just had them in my thigh
but I really love this song
another song diamond loving I'm loving -
from Thomas Rhett first off this song
the lyrics are just so good if you love
Thomas Rhett and you follow him his wife
and all that it's just such a good song
like it's so cute and I just love it I
love like when people write about their
lives you know and like you could tell
that they're writing about their lives
this is really great it's called life
changes by Thomas read
another one from him is one that's not
super country but it is pretty good
leave right now I really like the song
if you like
you guys know I'm a big Drake fan I feel
like everything he comes out with I love
it all like there's nothing that I don't
like from Drake of course I love nice
for wedding next one that I love is I
like it with cardi B cardi B her new
album is so good very explicit but so
good I just love her personality I've
also been loving the song never mind by
Dennis Lloyd
this song in the last song that I really
like this month is 2002 by Anne Marie I
think it is so cute
it's just such a good song and so cute I
love it so much so that is all of my
hits misses for the month of April and
