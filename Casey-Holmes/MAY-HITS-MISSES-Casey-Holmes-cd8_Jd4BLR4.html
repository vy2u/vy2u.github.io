June hits and misses and I know I
haven't been on here in a while I still
have some pre-sewn videos I need to get
up for you but I had to film my April
hit earth my April but I had to film my
hits and misses because I've tried out
some things that above and some things
that I'm just like not so much and if
you've been wondering where I've been if
you don't follow me on my blog channel
or I think I've mentioned on my main
channel a couple times I'm not sure but
I have been traveling so much these past
couple weeks like it's insane
I went to Davis's graduation that was a
week and then right when we came back we
had to go to LA a couple days later
because if you guys don't follow me on
snapchat or Instagram I am doing a
collab with Smashbox and I am so excited
about this it's my first big clap and
you guys are going to love it love it
love it love it I cannot wait oh it's so
exciting they will be out like next year
around summertime so it is a while till
it comes out but the time will pass and
you need time for good products am i
right it's gonna be a little bit time
but I am so excited for it and it's just
so much fun I've just it's so surreal
being out there and like picking out
different things and you'll see it I
can't go into too much detail I can tell
you is that is with Smashbox and it's
gonna be legit so I did that and I came
home I've been home for about four days
and then this Thursday I am leaving to
go on the cruise to Alaska with Davis so
really excited about that that's gonna
be for a full week when we come back the
next day we go to a wedding in a
different state and then we go from
there straight to Charleston South
Carolina for another week so it's gonna
be hectic insane but like I said I do
have some videos pre-filmed even though
it's really hectic I'm gonna try to stop
cram sessions stuff in and upload for
you guys and if you don't follow me on
my blog channel I have been vlogging a
lot so you should check that out I'll
leave a link for it down below just
vlogging about my life different things
we're gonna vlog the cruise we're just
vlogging everything we're kind of taking
a break these past four days because we
just want to like get our lives together
and kind of relax but we did block his
graduation and the LA trip which I still
have to edit we won't be vlogging these
next couple weeks
so no that was a long intro but I
figured I would kind of cut you up and
if you can't tell I did go lighter with
my hair I did this yesterday well I
didn't do it my hairstylist Jessica did
and she is the best hair stylist ever
I'm obsessed to her I wanted to go a
little bit lighter so we made it a
little bit more ashy a little bit
lighter on the ends and I loved it and I
hope you guys loved it as well I haven't
even had time to self tan so right now
I'm more fair than I have been in a
really long time but I'm actually really
liking it I'm not even a light I just I
haven't even thought about self-tanning
I've brought it with me every time I
travel but I'm just like I don't have
time to sit there and do it you know cuz
at the end of the day I'm just so tired
so I'm rocking like kinda a little bit
of Sun kind of not let the bronzer you
know that good thing so do you want to
see all of my hits and misses for the
month of June then let's just go ahead
and get started really quickly before we
get into the hit I want to mention what
is on my lips because right now I'm
really loving it but I haven't used it
all month to tell you if it's a hit or
miss whatever but right now it is a hit
I got these in the mail these are these
smashbox always on liquid lipsticks and
this is in the shade stepping out i'm
wearing it right now
i love it it is so pigmented and I also
love the packaging of this so I do
really love it I just haven't been using
it all month long but I'm gonna take
these when I go on my cruise and to the
beach because it's been so windy lately
that I haven't been wearing gloss
because my hair gets caught in it with
lipsticks are the way to go for me and
I'm excited to take a few more colors on
my trips but definitely check them out
so far I'm really loving it okay so next
up I want to mention this this is kind
of random but since I've been traveling
it's been like a necessity I decided
when I got back from New York that I
wanted to buy a beauty blender case
because I was tired of my beauty blender
just like rolling around with my makeup
brushes so I really like this some
people probably don't think it's a
necessity but I kind of think it is
because first off you can hold two
Beauty blenders in there I know they're
super dirty got to clean that it is like
a mesh material so instead of it being
in my brush case where it's enclosed and
like say the Beauty Blender is a little
bit more damp it's gonna hold that
moisture in where the mesh here lets it
breathe out that way the Beauty Blender
dries completely and there's not a lot
of moisture like trapped into the Beauty
Blender so it doesn't get like nasty
next thing I want to know
the comments if you guys remember me
talking about this back in the day this
used to be the only cleansing oil that I
used and I forgot all about it until I
got a PR package with it and I was like
I forgot how much I love this this is
the boscia makeup breakup cool cleansing
oil and I used to use this so much and
then I got caught on to my clinic take
off the day balm which I still am
obsessed with I've just been taking this
one with me when I travel because the
clinic one's like a big round tub and
this is a little bit slimmer so I can
just like dip it into my you know makeup
bag and this takes off all your makeup
it is so good I just I forgot how much I
love this so I've been using it a ton
highly recommend it and it's great for a
sensitive oily skin doesn't break me out
whatsoever love this leave a comment if
you remember me talking about that back
in the day because that was a while back
this is the next body thing and I think
this is the last body thing but it's the
Becca luminous body perfecting mousse in
Palma beach I love this this makes you
look so airbrushed and bronzed I use
this a whole week of Davis's graduation
I used it in LA if I'm wearing like a
top like this I didn't use it today
because I was just trying to hurry and
get ready but if I'm wearing a top like
this it's kind of low-cut or I have
something showing my shoulders I will
put this all over my chest and arms and
shoulders and it just gives a nice
golden glow to the skin and it also
bronzes the skin so if your foundation
is like a little bit too dark you could
throw this on blend it out and it looks
so good on the skin but once you like
blend it in it just looks so bronzed and
beautiful it has like gold shimmer in
there okay this is a great alternative
if you just haven't had time to self tan
but you want that bronzed glow and it
just really evens out that skin tone and
gives you some golden shimmer on your
body it's just stunning I love it you
guys have heard me mention it before but
I just wanted to quickly shout it out
again because it is a true standout
product for me and I absolutely love it
it's the soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck of a blot
foundation all day liquid to powder
foundation 12-hour technology and super
blur powers 100% agree with every single
thing that it says the longevity the
blurring power the shine block it is a
miracle product for me it keeps me matte
for a long period of time it doesn't
accentuate my pores and it lasts for so
long I was going between this one and my
Marc Jacobs remar
well Foundation which I love that
foundation but sometimes it can just
look a little too cakey and to make up
II you know what I'm saying so this one
just looks gorgeous on the skin and it
looks gorgeous in pictures thanks up for
foundation this is the one that I'm
wearing right now the color matches
perfectly with me like not being super
soft and it's in the color 2.3 it's in
the color 2.3 and it's the Smashbox
Studios skin the 15 hour hydrating
foundation I like this so much one thing
I will do is I'll take the green pencil
from Smashbox and I will put it over my
redness and blend it out I really like
that pencil to counteract the redness
that I have now use a beauty blender and
put this all over my skin and I just
feel like it looks like skin like it
looks so beautiful it doesn't look too
matte it doesn't look too dewy it's that
perfect in-between combo for me and
honestly it lasts for such a long time
as long as I set it with powder I just
love how my skin looks with it looks
really airbrush it doesn't accentuate my
pores anything like that highly
recommend this if you are looking for
another foundation this is about a
medium to full coverage foundation
sometimes I'll go over a little bit
extra in certain areas but for the most
part I can do one round and I'll be good
to go so I forgot to mention this when I
was doing like a body products and stuff
but this is a new mask that I've been
using it's the out Genest clarifying
pore corrector mask and I showed this in
my last video which was like my paper
nighttime routine guys if you are
breaking out you need this now I am a
firm believer in the glam glow the white
one but this is so good
I will say it does not smell that great
and it is kind of scary-looking because
when you start watching this off it kind
of looks like blood but this really does
like just tighten your pores dries out
any acne or anything that you have going
on on your face when it Davis's
graduation week came around I was
breaking out so bad and I was so happy
that I brought this because I used it
pretty much every night every other
night until my breakouts were gone and
they were gone within like 2 or 3 days
with this product I've actually used
quite a bit of it and you can't tell but
I've used it so much like I said not a
big fan of the smell but the product and
what it does is amazing I highly
recommend it ok next up is a bronzer
this is the Kiko desert dunes
baked bronzer in two hundred warm Milosh
I guess this is quite a big product you
can see it's fairly large but this is
the bronzer that I have on today I have
it kind of on my chest and all over my
face and I love it
it smells kind of like chocolate like
reminds me of the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer you get a ton of product
in this and it's just a really gorgeous
warm I got that mask all over me this is
just a really gorgeous warm bronzer I
feel like when you swatch it it doesn't
even do it justice you can't even see it
on my hand but it really does warm up
the complexion and making you look like
you just came back from the beach which
is what I need right now is I have a
soaps and such a soft powder and it just
blends out so well I'll even use it as
blush I have it in my crease right now
to define it and it's just perfect it's
kind of going in a weird order here but
I want to also shout out this Real
Techniques setting brush now I got this
in a set of this purple pink color not
too long ago but I have been using this
as a contour brush just because it's
fluffy like of a contour brush that has
the orange handle but it's just a little
bit smaller so I like it to get right in
there in that contour line and just
blend it out I've been using this for
the past few weeks and I've been really
loving it so if you're looking for a new
contour brush this set is the way to go
they also have what is in that set
there's like a highlighting brush in
there and I think another kind of fluffy
brush yes it's like a fluffy angled
brush I believe but really great brushes
in this color set I love it I had never
seen it before and then I went into Ulta
and checked the mountain I was like
where is this set been I've never seen
this before it's a few more items I want
to shout out these flutter lashes these
are the sleigh 'la lashes but this is
what it looks like I believe I saw
Jaclyn wear these in her snapchat and I
went and bought them but these are just
my kind of lashes like if I created
lashes this is how they would look very
full very wispy and they're just amazing
with liner without liner
I love lashes like this they remind me
of the velour lashes the fluff and
whispies they are kind of pricey I
believe I'll leave the link down below
because I can't remember it's been so
long since I purchased them two lip
products I want to mention this one is
the collab that Manny in Oprah had and I
and wearing this color so much it's in
the shade charmed I want to say I
absolutely love offers packaging I don't
have a lot of offer products I have
Kathleen's products which are amazing
and then also had the ones that Manny
came out with and like I said this is in
the shade charmed and this is just you
see it sticks so similar to the color
I'm wearing just a little bit more pink
and mauve it's just a little bit lighter
but I love this color it lasts all day I
had so many compliments when I wore this
it's just beautiful and the formula is
great it's really creamy easy to apply
and yeah I just love it so oprah's
lasting what does it offers long lasting
liquid lipstick and charm is and I
believe mani and Afra made these
permanent or back in stock I can't
remember but I will leave a link form
down below so you guys can check them
out another one is this tortoise lip
paint oh you guys can see that this is
just the color scheme I go with right
now um this isn't TBT and again I love
this I also love the doe foot applicator
it's a little bit different oh my gosh
look these all look so similar
I love the formula of this as well last
for a while and Davis love this color he
told me he really liked it when I wore
it so that's a plus when your boyfriend
like she lipstick that's a good thing
this is another great alternative and
this does smell like mint which I'm
usually not a huge fan of mint but this
doesn't bother me it doesn't really last
for a super long time like that smell it
doesn't last for a while on my lips so I
love that but the color does last for a
long time eating drinking anything like
that this is good stuff I actually want
more colors okay now I want to get on to
the Misses I only have two misses and
one of them I think I forgot to mention
last month but I'm gonna mention it now
did I mention this last month this is a
Tarte high-performance natural
rainforest of the sea aqua concealers I
know so many people love this line and I
haven't tried the foundation but I did
try the concealer and honestly it's just
not my thing it didn't cover enough for
me I'm not that big of a fan of the
applicator and I'm personally more of a
super full coverage person like the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer has
just been my favorite for a while and I
just
get on this bandwagon I don't know what
it is it just doesn't look that great
underneath my eyes I feel like I need
more coverage when I use this so not my
favorite I know a ton of people that do
love this though but it's just not my
cup of tea like I'm still using the
urban decay one so and then this one is
one I'm so disappointed in I'm gonna buy
this I bought this before I left to go
out of town the first time and I was so
excited to have it because it's kind of
like a two in one compact but personally
it just didn't work for me this is the
bare minerals matte matte and globe
brilliant what do they call this I don't
even know what they call this but it's
just a powder duo one side is matte one
side is glow I totally get they're going
for a really subtle glow with this one
but I just don't like it like I feel
like it's just it's just not my cup of
tea I don't know I feel like it doesn't
give me the glow that I want and if it
does I have to pack this sucker on like
way way way too much and I don't know I
just I'm not a big fan of it and the
matte side is just so I don't know if
you could see that on my finger but that
it's just so choppy and I just don't
feel like it blends out that well this
is just not a favorite of mine I was
super disappointed and I was I had high
hopes I thought it was so cool that I
had a matte powder and it glow powder
because even though I'm oily and I love
a good matte powder I also love a good
glow like something to put on the tops
of my cheekbones and anything like that
and this just didn't do it for me so
really cute packaging just I'm not a big
fan of the product if you're wondering
why I'm wearing as a highlighter today I
just went with a really bronzed glow
because I didn't have a lot of time to
get ready but I'm wearing this
highlighter basically all over my face
I'm obsessed with it so makeup
revolution baked highlighter in radiant
lights and it is gorgeous it's just
gorgeous this highlighter is look at
that that's the kind of glow that I want
so yeah if you're looking for a really
good highlighter this one's like six
bucks it's amazing definitely check out
makeup revolution so that is it for my
June hits and misses
I usually include music favorites at the
end of this but right now I don't have a
lot of music favorites to share with you
so I'm gonna save those till next month

music at that time
