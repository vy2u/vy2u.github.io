looking a little crazy because I have
these big false lashes on my eye makeup
done but nothing on my face which we're
gonna fix in just a second I've been
seeing this video go around so much and
I really wanted to do it so bad it's
mixing all your foundations together and
the only thing I'm really nervous about
is the color like what the colors gonna
turn out but I feel like I'm gonna love
the finish because pretty much almost
all my foundations are like full
coverage there Matt's not really many
medium coverage foundations that all
these are pretty like high in tints full
coverage products so I'm hoping they
don't turn out cakey but I really think
I would like the finish so yeah I've
been curious about this video I've been
wanting to do it so I finally had time
to sit down and film it because I just
got back in town so that's why there was
a gap there in between videos so I
apologize but I am back and I wanted to
start off with something fun and I feel
like mixing all my foundations together
is something that is just super fun so
about 33 foundations
today to mix for you guys we have
drugstore high-end and again all these
different types of colors because we all
know I self-tan I'm a different color
all the time so let's just hope we get a
good color after this intro we're just
gonna jump into mixing all the
foundations together if you're not
subscribed already be sure to hit that
subscribe button before you leave and
let's just go ahead and get started
alright guys I have all of my
foundations here ready to be put into
this little container that I have let's
start with some Burt's Bees
we begun
enough for me
you
stubby Reed
now
not for me
have everything in this little thing
it's a lot of foundation so I'm gonna
scrape the edges now here is what the
foundation looks like that we have I'm
gonna use what's on the back of my brush
as well I'm going to use this little
brush from luck see it's the eight three
twos when they have their Wonder Woman
collection and I'm going to do this oh
actually I almost four out of time first
I'm going to prime I'm gonna use my
Smashbox primer water and I'm gonna use
my soap and glory one heck of a blot
primer I'm gonna put this on the side of
my face take some off this brush and
we're gonna see dang
I knew a people coverage but wow it's a
little dark for me buds I oh my god it's
really dark Wow my forehead looks so my
skin looks actually really good like my
texture looks really good my pores
aren't crazy out there we will add
concealer in just a little bit but I
really like that so far I mean it's
obviously like super full coverage but
look at this from this side to this side
just not mine the neck like I told you
guys almost every foundation that I have
is pretty dang full coverage I don't
really have anything that's medium
coverage or light coverage just because
I don't gravitate towards those man I
look really tan but I knew this would be
like a very full coverage because I mean
you have the hood of beauty foundation
in here there's you weigh one even
though I haven't been able to really
find my exact shade for the jouer I
still think it's really nice it's really
full coverage it's just I have a problem
finding my perfect shade but it's
definitely heavier you can see it's
definitely heavier I'm so surprised it
has a glow to it like I don't know who's
got the glow in here you know what I'm
thinking it is maybe it's the Maybelline
better skin oh the Smashbox one to do
your skin one's pretty dewy oh we have
the NARS sheer glow I could add some do
so we do have a couple dewy products in
here it doesn't look bad surprisingly
enough I mean it just looks like I got
really tan in like five seconds now we
apply Tarte shape tape in okay I'm gonna
get a much darker shade than this so I
have the torch shape tape concealer in
light medium so probably be not too
light yeah this isn't gonna be this is
gonna be good so I had like neutral in
my hand and I just knew that would be
way too light I'm gonna go ahead and
apply my concealer finish off my face
and then we'll come back and talk about
it we'll talk about all the products
you got me paper then do a concrete base
stubbing romance in the - you got me
baby keep on coming back to you I know
bet you know if you already messed it up
with my makeup and I have to say I
actually don't mind it now the color is
still pretty dark but like my texture
and all that really doesn't look bad at
all
um concealer blended really well on top
of the contour highlighter blended
really well and it is just a very full
glam look you know mixing all the
foundations together obviously because
they're super high coverage but I really
like it and I'm really not surprised it
does look a little heavy obviously
because there's so many intense high
coverage foundations in here but I think
it looks pretty good I think it doesn't
look bad morning when I shadow I'm
wearing I decided to play with this
palette today so this is what I have on
my eyes it's the double duty by Tarte
shake shape your moneymaker but it's a
really basic palette you know nothing
too crazy I just used these shades right
here and it makes a little bit of this
in there so that's what it looks like
that's pretty much it for this video I
had so much fun of filming it let me
know if you guys have tried this out
like have you mixed all your foundations
together to see what kind of outcome
you'd have I want to know it down below
in the comments which you thought but
also it leave the person who started
this tag down below in the video as well
because I have no idea I've seen so many
people do this video that I don't know
where it started so I will put down
below who started this tag also if

video you would like to see next from me
