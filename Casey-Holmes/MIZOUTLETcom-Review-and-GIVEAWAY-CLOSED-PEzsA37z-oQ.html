accessory site they have hair stuff

person who will go out and spend six to
ten dollars on jewelry that's just not
me I'm like for one piece of jewelry i
will not do that this stuff is all
pretty much under five dollars on the

me a delivery confirmation thursday and
it was here by saturday so it was super
fast shipping and the products are such

are and I just like I'm in love with
them and um the packaging was so cute

picture here

below i'm going to go ahead and show you
guys really quickly what do guys will be
getting so i picked out a lot of stuff
for you guys and I think you're gonna
love it so this is all going to you guys
first thing is this like little headband
and everything is in its packaging
because I didn't want to take it out or
anything like that but this is just
hedging on I pick sort of a neutral
color know a lot of people are into
headbands and stuff so I just picked
that one like that and I got you guys a
little bracelet like this is like a
turquoise textured bracelet it's really
cute you also get another headband which
these have like little leaves on them
but that was really pretty just like a
statement piece or whatever it's really
gorgeous i love it not too much next
you're going to get the same pair of
earrings that i got i decided since i
love them so much i figured you guys
would too because they're super pretty
blue next it's like a little um black
kind of cuff and it has little snuggle
over and intends little um you know fake
diamond every now and then it's just
really pretty next thing is another
bracelet this is kind of like a wooded
what is a wooden bracelet kind of thing
and it's just like a pink with like some
green and it's really pretty if that was
great for spring next you guys are
getting this necklace now beat it being
in the package doesn't really do it
justice but um like I saw it on the
internet on the medic and I was like
that is so pretty and it comes with a
bracelet and a pair of earrings but it
just looks like this kind of like a
wispy necklace I guess then your guide
you guys aren't get this ring
just very nice and you're going to get
these earrings this just looks like this
and they kind of have a wood you're
backing to them and then it has the
little flower front these are really
pretty and they kind of hang down lower
so they're really great long earrings
then you're gonna get the same bird ring
that I had is just in gold mine was in
silver then you're to get this ring
pillows like this and a lot of these are
adjustable too so they should fit
everybody you're getting two of the same
rings that you're getting one in silver
and one in gold they're like little
wings and their rings wing wing ring
they look like John's tools and I'll
keep this thing just like that so it's
going to be definitely a statement ring
but it's really cute so you're getting
one in gold and kind of like well it's
not really silver is kind of a gunmetal
color you're going to get one of the
popular things I see all the time and
it's a double um finger ring and it says
love on it get another next month that's
pretty much the same as um this one is
it as soon as this one like I showed you
guys footage once and like a bronzy kind
of color it's really cute and of course
that these you get a little set of
earrings too then you're gonna get these
earrings I thought they were cute
because they kind of have like little
flower detail but they hang down low and
then they have just like this kind of
pop of color I thought that was really
cute and just nice and feminine I
thought you guys would be like it so
pick those out here to get this bracelet
kind of like a fabric bracelet with a
little charm on it so it just looks like
this you're going to get another pair of
earrings and these are kind of ones I
hang download to and they just look like
that they're very pretty and you're
going to get another ring that looks
like this a pretty little flower ring a
little pearl in the middle you will be
guided 16 eyeshadow pencils okay so you
