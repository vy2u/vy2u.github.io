you ready so excited to finally be
making this video I have been wanting to
of course tell you guys about this for
so long but I just couldn't tell you and
now is the time we are finally here and
I get to announce my newest class I'm so
excited and you want to know why because
it's with an affordable brand it is with
Palladio and I am just so thrilled I'm
pumped I'm ready for you guys get your
hands on this stuff I'm so excited I
have to keep it a secret anymore it
hurts my soul to keep collabs a secret
I'm not even kidding
and then when I start wearing it because
obviously I have to wear it and test it
out and make sure I love it umm when you
guys ask me questions about what I'm
wearing I'm like oh I can't tell you
like I just I can't say anything and it
just hurts me inside but now I can
finally share my little babies that plaw
do and I worked together to create and I
am so thrilled oh ok it's hard to keep a
secret honey I am not good at secrets
like whenever I give people presents I
normally give it to them ahead of time
because I'm like take it open it are you
ready to see what we did I'm wearing one
of them now my collab is 3 lip these are
the lippies you guys have been asking
constantly about that I've been wearing
all over my Instagram for the past few
months and I'm so happy with these
colors I'm so happy with the packaging I
love these so much they're also a
different kind of formula to that I
think you guys are really going to enjoy
got some newbies
I'm so excited when Palladio came to me
and told me they wanted a collab with me
with lip products I was like yes 100% I
know what colors I want to do I know my
names I know all of it like I was ready
to go so I love cláudio if you guys
don't know they're an informal brand I
have been using Palladio for years now
and they are just such an awesome brand
I love their matte blushes I love their
blotting sheets which are some of my
like holy grails if you're oily I love
their bronzers or highlighters they have
so many great things I also love their
lippies so when they approached me about
lip products I was like yes let's work
on a formula let's get some shades
together I already kind of knew my
Shay's Inola
I already kind of knew what shades I
wanted to do but we really did work
together for like the packaging I told
them what I wanted
my name is on it it's very exciting and
I'm just I'm so excited to finally share
these with you guys as most of you know
I love liquid lipsticks they're my
favorite I look for products that I can
put on have them last all day and not
have to worry about them and this this
is it these Alypius are botanical and
vitamin infused and they are paraben
free and they are cruelty free as well
and the reason why I decided to go with
these three lip products is because I
wanted something that I was really
passionate about like I'm really
passionate about these colors and I know
a lot of you could get a lot of use out
of these I wanted you guys to be able to
buy it and wear it constantly I didn't
want to do too crazy of colors because I
wanted you to be able to spend your
money on these and get your money's
worth and let me tell you they are so
affordable you are going to wear these
so much let's talk about the shades the
formula what I love how to wear them
what to do you know the drill basically
there's three shades you have this
peachy color this one's in the shade
georgia georgia peach then we have
rescue right here which is like a
classic nude you guys is so beautiful
and then we have obsessed obsessed and i
am obsessed with this color if you like
the names really speak about me I feel
like everything about this is just very
personal to me and I love that about
this and so glad they were able to let
me be so hands-on with this and really
create these and make them perfect I
absolutely love the packaging I wanted
something where you guys could see the
color that's like huge for me so we did
put a little color swatch here around
the lid so if you have these standing up
on your vanity you can see them and of
course you can see through them as well
packaging is absolutely beautiful very
nice just a really high-quality
packaging and we did do the same
lipstick shape inside because I loved
the way that looks there's just
something different I think it's really
pretty and they do have this kind of
shape in another lippy that they have
and I was like can we do that shape in
mine too because I think it's really
cute I love that it looks like a
lipstick and there's packaging is
exclusive to our collab I absolutely
adore it I could not have asked for a
better packaging for lip products like I
love seeing the color swatch the color
here Palladio Casey Holmes right here
will says kch that's how I sign my name
has Pilate okay see homes here and then
a does
have the names on at the bottom you open
these up do have an applicator that
looks like this it is rounded on the end
so it is easy to get up there in your
Cupid's bow and really just round out I
just got some on my lip so since it is
more of a rounded tip it is easy to just
round out on your Cupid's bow and really
get a nice line this doe foot applicator
does have quite a bit of product on it
as you guys can see so you're not gonna
have to constantly keep dipping in here
to get more and more product a lot of it
does come off but it's not too much to
where it's overwhelming that's what I
really love about this let's talk about
the formula I absolutely love this
formula now when you first put it on
it's not gonna dry right away it takes a
good couple minutes for it to dry when
you put it on it actually kind of looks
like a gloss and you're like oh but it
is so what I love the most about it not
drying completely is if you mess up you
still have time to go in and fix it it's
not completely permanent just yet
especially with this darker lip color
you can go in and kind of move it and
redo it if you mess up or go outside the
lines and it doesn't dry down to like a
sticky mat feeling it is completely
matte but if you put your lips together
they don't like do that sticky thing you
know sometimes when you put your lips
together with certain liquid lips they
like stick and it goes this doesn't do
that this formula you guys is
moisturizing it lasts all day I'm not
even kidding
this last through meals you could even
see in one of my previous vlogs we were
out at like a Mexican restaurant I was
eating fajitas and my lip color was
still on after we ate that's one thing I
love about these I really have to go
back in and fix my lip products these
just last so well throughout the day
they don't feel uncomfortable Oh half
the time I forget I'm wearing them these
are gonna last so long on your lips what
I have on my lips right now is giorgia
so it's the peachy nude shade this is
the lightest shade in the collection and
I really love this one I was a little
nervous at first but I knew I wanted
something a little bit lighter because
not everybody loves a darker nude which
rescue is I created this shade and I
have just fallen in love with it I think
this is the perfect everyday color along
with rescue I think it just looks so
beautiful with any look if you're new to
my channel don't know too much about me
I am from Georgia and it's the Peach
State so it's a
she nude named Georgia because Georgia
is near and dear to my heart I have
certainly left Georgia this other color
is a warm taupe which is absolutely
beautiful it is named a rescue I think
it's like that perfect and new to wear
with again anything even with just a
really light makeup look like this or if
you're just wearing mascara then again
if you're super bold and dramatic this
is beautiful too so I have a really big
passion for rescuing pups roses a rescue
I really believe in that and that you
should adopt so I wanted to name this
rescue because I felt like you guys
would just get it and I was like there
has to be something named rescue again
you do have that same applicator and
that's how much comes off the doe foot
and then that is the shade isn't that
just so beautiful and creamy just like a
classic color I love it kind of 90s - I
really feel it so I absolutely love this
and then obsessed is just if you want to
step outside your comfort zone and try
color but you're a little nervous on
what color to try this is perfect this
one right here is just a rich berry this
is the name obsessed and I am obsessed
with this one this is just absolutely
stunning I wore this in my favorite way
favorites I feel like the whole comments
section was asking me what lip color it
was and I felt so like guilty I was like
you should not have wore this in the
video but I wanted to wear it and kind
of give a little hint to you guys to
show you what's coming if you're kind of
nervous to try color I feel like this is
a great color to try because it's just a
classic berry but it's not too deep to
where it's like super vampy you guys
know my love those colors too but I also
love Dee's kind of colors for like
summer you can wear for fall winter this
is a great year-round bold color that
you can wear and it is just so pretty on
the lips so this is obsessed it's AB -
cesta that's what it looks like again if
you want to see it on my lips you could
check out that February favorites video
I'll also do some swatches in here as
well because I don't want you guys to be
without some swatches in this video on
my lips like I told you guys earlier
they do come out looking glossy but they
dry down to a matte finish within a
couple minutes so all you I do is just
kind of sit there make sure you have it
all perfect and then you'll be good to
go it'll dry down and it will not budge
throughout the day
they're so lightweight and so
comfortable to wear I cannot wait for
you guys to put your hands on them we're
gonna quickly show you again up close
what these look like because I just
think they're so cute
I've been carrying these around me so
much I almost showed it in my recent
vlog and I was like girl so here's the
packaging again so pretty though there
is what they look like a closed sorry my
lights are kind of doing a glare I know
