really see my viewfinder so bright out
here but today we are going to be doing
the boyfriend by the my makeup video
which I thought was so cool morning news
is forever now so we're here we're
actually added a Sephora inside JCPenney
let him go in there and it's kind of
good that it's the one in JCPenney
because you can't spend too much money
because there's not a lot of like super
high-end one he knows he can't ask any
for any help I can't help him I'm going
to like let him do it being in Sephora
and we're going to see later when he
picks out and I have to do my full face
of makeup with the things that he picked
out so that will be interesting it the
person I saw do this is Jamie so shout
out to Jamie for creating this and
you're so fun and different are you
excited
ready oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
oh god oh god oh god here alright so I
got some priming spring time I got yes
and now I have to pick out a foundation
I'm assuming these are foundations so I
don't see if we go with the right color
got this
is overwhelming easy when I can figured
out of Casey's room because I just look
for the foundation and I know it's the
foundation Network she youngest I don't
know hit nice so far
no I got the eyebrows covered and
eyelashes foundation I have to do
something for the lips now something for
the list
so let's I got a list oh here we go Oh
perfect exactly what I was looking for
yeah house is way too difficult but see
I don't know what goes on that for the
eyes of the face too freakin confusing
I've used this word before locally I'm
getting it and this picture of an eye
thank you
okay so we're leaving the local Sephora
and everyone was so nice I met the girls
after I had to go back in and pay with
Davis and they were saying that as of
today my palette is sold out here okay
yeah it's so amazing
Syd are you excited nervous thank you
guys enough
I just I recognized by the little pink
cross the thread cap on it you know okay
okay guys so we are back from Sephora
and now I'm going to see everything that
Davis picked out I know you got a plan
hey I got some priming spray you got the
Urban Decay quick fix high charge
complexion prep priming spray here's
foundation foundation at least it's oil
free this is a Sephora ten hour wear
perfection foundation and you got me the
shade medium so I think that might be
really good match right now I think I've
tried this before I can't remember after
foundation and I need concealer this is
the Beca aqua luminous perfecting
concealer in medium you got
this is yeah the domesticated it roller
lash yes I love this stuff on one this
is the Smashbox always on the sharp
waterproof coal liner and then we get
right there so it's exciting and it is
black or brown this is the color storm
Oh
looks black oh it's a grey mmm
then moves up to the eyebrow okay again
fill through eyebrows this is bu benefit
precisely my brow pencil in the same for
I saw the word smokey eye palette okay
70 got the Smashbox cover shot with the
eye palette I can't get over these
obviously doesn't care what's next then
you got a contour I remember that word
ah you got the Anasazi a contour kit the
lights and medium I remember you talking
about how when you put your foundation
on you got to set it okay yeah Kat Von D
setting powder it's gonna be good
here's your highlighter he got the cover
FX perfect light highlight powder I
never tried to support we're going to
see how well that is in the shade
sunlight well we'll see
whoopee they have some that were like
really sparkly but one thing that kept
me going to help me out was I know you
like nudes
so stayed near all the nudes I think
you're like one crazy killer just
telling ya doesn t nice I like I'm
Sophia then here's your bush okay
I like these the Too Faced put your
heart blood tonight your bronzer ah good
I like the fronds there a lot to you
okay that one specifically yeah because
they were like five I know wasn't really
sure but yes please don't use it in a
while but I used to love it but now
lastly I think that a lipstick in the
shade under s I like this one I actually
have this one more so this is a chart
max tint and undressed oh no this isn't
what I have this is don't have this
different eye color though very
pigmented well things the only thing I
don't have is a with a liner eye shadow
primer eyelashes because you know I love
my lashes so I looked for false lashes
and it could
well you don't want to be so say so you
got you got the most important part
since you're the face products I think
for me the most important part is faith
but of course an eyeshadow primer too
but I wouldn't expect you to get an
eyeshadow primer yeah oh yeah okay so
we're gonna get started with the primer
that you got again this is the Urban
Decay
quick-fix Hydra charge complexion prep
priming spray hopefully and slap is a
really good primer not very for filling
it's okay fill in my pores so that like
you won't see my pores as much whenever
I put foundation on so this is what it
looks like that's no good
the coconut is so strong undergraduates
myself was my mouth I'm gonna let that
sink into the skin and we're going to go
ahead and look at this Smashbox smoky
palette I don't know if I've used this
before I know I use a couple other oh I
have I use the green in this okay
so again we don't have primer okay so
I'm going to go in with the lightest
shade put that all over my lid just to
set it good I like this one right here
NARS one they are NARS in there denied
I'm surprised you two getting our stuff
I would I specifically didn't kinda you
have almost look at how dark my face is
compared to my net because of my redness
just going to go in with this shade
right here and put it into the crease
I'm going to go in with a black and just
going to put this in the outer V and in
the crease and then we'll blend the
crease out with the same color we just
put in there blue rose it's makeup deke
oh yeah she did that like a while ago
but when I had to you I think you're a
major school and I had to take her to
the vet because she wasn't acting really
great at all we shouldn't have anything
in her stomach luckily what color should
I go for my lid this one sure you take
this shade it's all over my leg hmm I
should then green
I feel something something coming
together times like this I wish I had a
liquid liner
oh not obsessed but I'm going to take
the benefit roller lash everybody like
this mascara it's really nice go up
close you can see the red and the black
not really obsessed with the palette oh
like it's not my favorite I can go there
other ones are fabulous in the earlier
held their advertising literally is what
made me pick it they had a picture of an
eye I knew it was for the eyes because I
didn't know what was like a face palette
versus an eye palette and all this stuff
on half the gondolas okay now we're
going to take this up for a 10 hour
we're perfecting foundation yeah I think
I've used this before I think it was
really good coverage color actually my
sympathetic at least you didn't get
anything too warm sometimes the light
like look different you know and then
when you get the foundation home oh yeah
all right yeah you see what I mean like
what sport like if I had a pore filler
it was filling these pores and then when
the foundation went on top of it it
wouldn't accentuate them human we go
dark my eyes like we thought this
concealer on they were going to be in
business now we're going to take the
effect at aqua luminous concealer and
medium might be a little dark but it'll
probably either match the skin or just
to get a little too dark
I like a highlighted effect underneath
my the light one was freaking white it's
not for sure ish meeting was the right
call
it's a little dark that's okay I've used
this concealer before just so you guys
know and it's not my favorite um it's
not really good for super oily skin in
my opinion and it doesn't have the
coverage that I like but it is easy to
blend out it's just for me it's not my
favorite just doing it
since he got us a powder we're going to
set it with the Kat Von D Luckett powder
I have used this before and I'm not the
biggest fan of this one I do really like
the brightening powder though to see a
little smaller ones I like the
brightening powder a little bit more on
this one just isn't my absolute favorite
but it's not terrible you know I'm
saying north the shine look they can
kick right now we're going to use the
benefit precisely my brow brow pencil I
have used this before and I do like it
as let me know I'm more of a pomade
person but so got me a bell tonic
alright he got me the shade number four
might be a little dress I never used
pencil so this is kind of like they
always make me take forever you might
wanna get some popcorn
can you guys switch brows my good bra
which brows my bad brow before I like
finish up you started on that one after
that you good bro you think doesn't like
the rap oh you wait you know what see I
can never get pencils right because it
always blend but then I blend away my
foundation and stuff from so much that I
was Paul made this is the one that I can
never make it look the way I wanted to
this OS brow does it look like a big
bushy eyebrow now what no it can't make
it work I cannot economic this work
I hate pencil this is like five hundred
to dark okay so now we're going to take
the Too Faced - sweetheart - bronzer in
CT this is what it looks like it's a
really great bronzer we think about the
bronzer yeah I'm going to go ahead and
use the contour kit this is a light to
medium one that David thought and I'm
just going to take I'm going to take
this color right here with a real
techniques brush I'm just going to
contour I would use this palette the
first came out so now going in with
sparkling Bellini which is the Too Faced
sweethearts perfect flush blush going to
lightly go on the cheeks because I can
still see some of my redness to Yonkers
in the foundation so I'm not going to go
too far with it the tie liner is going
to be interesting this one's in the
shade sunlit and I'm just going to take
this Sephora Pro contour number 30 or
979
it looks really dark in the pan believe
it or not like does that look like what
I have on my face right now again it's
been a shade storm and I should I choose
excellent Richmond and this has a
sharpener inside it as well a little bit
of a difference not very much whoo you
know we should say this is just a grungy
look yeah that's what's going for a
minute more that benefit roller lash on
just pretty much it this is this great
all right the last thing we've got is
this chart matte tint and undressed
looks like this at least it's matte
that's good actually I like that color
we go do the hair flip their foot you my
intros or like my makeover Lucy Davis
misses me wearing smokey makeup a lot
but I asked visceral is bad as I thought
it did like I thought it wasn't
everything pretty much went on really
well I don't have I set a primer
canister me up a little bit and we
crease in probably in like 30 minutes
but everything else looks fine the
highlight kind of surprised me the brows
are surprising me so hope you guys
