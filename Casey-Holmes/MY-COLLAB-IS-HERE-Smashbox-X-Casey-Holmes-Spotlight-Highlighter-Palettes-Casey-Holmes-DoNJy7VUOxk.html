there's a gold pallet and a pro palette
so if you want to get your hands on it
first like I said tomorrow Monday is
going to be a Smashbox calm I will
announce a secret code for you guys and
you can mag knees up so exactly today
I'm going to be demonstrating to you I
don't have any highlight on right now
I'm actually wearing the Kat Von D
locket foundation what you're doing like
a throwback throw down on that right now
so I didn't have any highlighter on
because I'm going to share with you guys
so on my Instagram post I said if you
have textured skin you're going to love
it if you put any highlight over texture
it is going to show what I mean by that
is like I have some texture on my skin
and larger pores and I can bring a
couple of these highlighters all the way
down to the top of my cheek and it
doesn't look crazy or intense anything
like that it just looks really beautiful
so that's what I meant by that this
looks really great there is one shade in
here that since I do have texture I like
to keep it more towards the back because
there's more of a glitter the way I want
to do cause to roll is for you to
customize your own highlight whatever
your feeling for the day you have three
shades to choose from if you're wanting
just something for every day if you want
to glam it up a little bit and then like
something if you're going out clubbing
or you just love a sparkly highlight
that is in here for you this was
originally supposed to be just one
palette but as I was going through the
colors and everything I had the hardest
time narrowing it down like we were all
sitting there in circle for I don't even
know how long putting different shades
together and color combos finally we
were just like well instead of one why
don't we just do two because it was so
hard to narrow it down so that's how the
Pearl and the gold came about because I
was like okay I love more pearl shades I
also love the gold and warm kind of
copper type of highlights as well to
highlight my body waves or if I'm really
bronzed in the summer both highlights
are my favorite in the summer I just
kind of wanted the best of both worlds
and just thanks to them for like letting
me come out with two instead of one that
was just so nice of them I really think
a lot of you are going to love this and
use it to death so let's just go ahead
and
started with these two pallet shall we
so we'll start with a purl one first
good I am going to put purl on my face
don't mind this roses playing with
palette but this is what the front of it
will look like so the top you have the
shade names you have turn it on pearl
crank it up pearl and blow a fuse pearl
and it's basically as long from like a
lighter highlight less intense to really
in to blow a fuse highlight so we went
for kind of simple names and then on the
back you have my picture and then I
wrote a little paragraph for you guys
and some more informations back here as
well and then it has this little
pamphlet like it said this is the pearl
oneself and could open it up like this
you have everything again with a little
paragraph in my picture in Annie's three
charts I actually worked on myself so
this is me basically talking to you guys
in the pamphlet just let you guys know
where I like supply highlighters on
different occasions and things like that
like went on the goal of my signature
glow and then like my going out one so I
have a picture on my Instagram which
I'll post it right here this was the
moment that I was doing these face
charts and like explaining everything so
I don't know I just like you guys might
like that if you're new to makeup don't
really know where to put your highlight
you can refer back to this and it will
help you out a lot if you're interested
so this pamphlet is in here this is what
the front looks like very very simple
but I love it and it's got smells here
on it and this is more of like a bubble
top right here which I love I love this
kind of buffle bubble overlay right here
and I know it gives me and reminds me of
something when I was younger but I can't
think it on my head and then for the
Pearl you open or not both palettes do
have a mirror this palette is nice and
compact so you can travel with it really
easily
and you do have the mayor's mirrors are
so important to me and I know that in
their three pan palettes they already
have mirrors and most of them so I was
like definitely wanna put that into this
palette this ones do you turn it on
pearl crank it up and blow a fuse you
can kind of see right here that the blow
fuse has a lot more glitter and it's a
lot far clearer than these two so this
is the one that like if you love a full
glam intense highlighter you're going to
love it I like to use it as a topper on
these other two so I'm going to put on
this one right now this one actually I'm
going to mix the two I love mixing these
two because it's hard for me to decide
but I really quickly do
to say that this one has like a story
behind it so if you've been watching me
for a while I used to rave about one of
the highlighters from Smashbox and one
of their palettes this was that color
and when we were doing this I was like I
need that color in this palette like I
have to have it we ended up putting it
in here it's a little bit more of a
different formula nice and creamy yeah
there's a little story behind that one
if you're interested that's how one of
the shades came about all you have to do
is dip your brush in here I wouldn't you
know don't go digging you rest in here
because you don't need to do that it'll
already come off a lot once you tap your
brush in there so I just like to go like
this just kind of mix the two together
and then there you have it you can see
how much product is on that brush just
do that tap it once and then I'll apply
it to boutiques and then if you feel
like you have too much on there so easy
to blend out so you don't ruin like your
whole makeup look just because you want
a little intense with your highlight so
that's really nice that is the pearl
right there
and then I'm going to take the blow a
fuse and where I can apply this one
since I do have more texture and larger
pores up here I like to keep this one
more towards the back since there is
thicker glitter in it and it's a little
bit more chunky so I like to just dab
this right here and what it does is just
adds that little extra sparkle and
really makes that highlight pop so
that's what that looks like
I've been wearing nude for a month you
guys if I have not answered your
question about like what highlight are
you wearing it's because I wasn't able
to tell you again I'm going to go back
into these two shades and now I'm going
to just apply this my hair so again I
can kind of bring it down towards here
then I like to take some of this first
one out here and I like to go down the
center of my nose with this just like
that and then I also like to take that
first one and highlight my brow bone
with it it is the lightest color just
normally what I do whenever I apply this
highlighter I normally like to do the
same brow bone highlight just because I
feel like it all sinks together really
well and just looks really beautiful so
just going to highlight that brow
into in paint so that's what it looked
like oh my gosh I'm so in love with
these colors I can't I keep piling them
on but I just can't help it so intense
and pretty that is the Pearl palette I
really really love it I mean I love
these palettes so much and I love it you
can kind of customize whatever you want
to do so if you want something really
intense you can just use this by itself
that's if you want or you could use
these too as well and like I said these
two are great for if you have
problematic skin but you still want to
try to wear highlight I would definitely
try these out and see if they work for
you because I feel like this kind of
formula is better for that you can see
like normally I have really bad texture
in this area but the highlights not
really accentuating that it's just kind
of making your glowy and nice so the
gold how it's actually a little bit
darker as you can see this was pearl
this was gold has more of the gold tones
to it
and I love this one X we have these two
smoother shades these are lighter gold
toned
shades and then you have this really
intense sparkly shimmering this one is
amazing as well as this one this one's
one of my favorites right here is very
intense and gold I just love it and then
you have that shimmer one ooh my nails
of that I'm sorry but that's what they
look like
put them on my hand and they're the
swatches right there I really really
love it
this one is so pretty once you put it on
the skin I like this color right here
for if I'm a little less tan than I
normally am I will use this if I want
more of a bold toned highlight because
it's not too dark so I could get away
with it
this one is really intense so I use this
if I'm about a medium skin tone and I'm
nice and self-tans
and then this one I use anytime because
it doesn't have too much of a base
underneath it's more of just that really
nice shimmer so you could get away with
using this on a little bit lighter skin
as well if you wanted a gold highlight
my face and my body will be doused in
this for summer like no light is going
to be intense I guess I'll have all the
dates and where they're going to be
available down below in the description
box I want to quickly again thank you
guys so much for all of your supports
the past couple years it is just insane
to me to be
sharing with you a product that I helped
put together and I'm so grateful to
Smashbox for letting me do this and
trusting me I hope you love it just as
much as I do because I have worn these
so much and I quickly before we go I'm
just going to show you guys the
evolution of how we got in spell it that
I have now so these two were the first
telex that I got they're very they're
just sample pallets I mean there was no
design on the front or anything it was
just basic pallets to see what I thought
of the shades so I put these to work I
wanted to see if they were going to work
out really well and this one is just the
gold pellet yeah I think this one's the
gold palette but what I used to do with
this one is I would jig my brush into
all these and put it all over my chest
and then we have the pearl palette now I
did change a few things about these
palettes because I wasn't impressed with
the formula of them they were a little
bit more on the dry side so we changed
up a couple of them being for the first
day so cute after we changed up a couple
things on that we got to be so these
were like the final samples of what the
front was going to look like the back
didn't have like the shade names or
anything like these do but this was the
final sample these are like the ones
that I tried and I was like that's a go
let's do it you guys can see right there
where I hit pin on this one I put these
two works girl work I was in love
against the formulas that I want and
then you have the ones that we have now
that look a lot neater and prettier but
I really do cherish these other palettes
and I'll probably never get rid of them
because they are what led to what we
have now so yeah I'm really in love with
these but I also forgot like as I was
showing you know this politic 4s
mentioned both palettes do have the
shade names on the back and the palette
name and just for reference I just
realized I didn't even say that so that
is it guys I hope you're add thank you
