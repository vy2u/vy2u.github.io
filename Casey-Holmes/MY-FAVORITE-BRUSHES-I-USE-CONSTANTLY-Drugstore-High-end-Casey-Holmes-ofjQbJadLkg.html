be sharing with you my favorite tools
for makeup we have brushes sponge we
have all that kind of stuff so I'm gonna
be sharing that with you today I've had
a lot of requests to have one specific
video with all my favorite brushes and I
went through picking out my favorites
that I know I used constantly and I
didn't realize how many that I really
truly loved so definitely stay tuned to
see all of them if you like this video

subscribe before you leave and if you
want to know some my favorite brushes
and tool yeah if you guys want to know
some of my favorite tool let's just go
ahead and get started okay so I'm gonna
talk about the one sponge that I have
and this because it's just this one
because I've been using it constantly
it's what I repurchased multiple
multiple times I do love the Beauty
Blender don't get me wrong I really do
love it but this one is a little more
affordable and I love it just as much if
not a little bit more I just I really
love this sponge so it is the Loreal a
sponge it looks like this it's pink I
buy so many backups of this because I
always need it on hand and I do feel
like you need to replace your sponges
like every few months I replaced mine
about every two to three months I don't
know that might be too long but I'm
trying to buy a new sponge every single
month I just feel like this is the best
drugstore sponge it's nice and bouncy
its firm but not too firm it just has a
nice soft texture to it and it really
blends out everything beautifully I've
never had an issue with this I feel like
anything goes on well with this this
doesn't soak up like a ton of your
product so you get to blend everything
out really nicely and I just love it
this is the best drugstore sponge in my
opinion over the Real Techniques over
the ones that you find a t.j.maxx this
is the way to go
so I do want to say I have some
drugstore options and some high-end
options in this video so you'll be
seeing kind of a mixture there but we're
gonna go ahead and start with eye
brushes and I really quickly want to
talk about the ones that I love from Mac
because Matt really does carry some of
my favorite brushes these Mac brushes
are like my staples I have to have these
at all times whether I'm traveling if
I'm here at home
I need these brushes in my life if I
lose one I have to buy another one so
the first one is the Mac 217 I feel like
this by the way these are all dirty
because I use them so sorry this is the
Mac 217 it is just a nice fluffy
blending brush it's great for the crease
it's pretty much great for everything
it's just just one of those
multi-purpose brushes that you need in
your collection it's awesome I love that
this one keeps its shape
I've had these brushes for so freakin
long and they just keep their shape they
haven't like worn down or anything it's
just a nice staple brush that lasts a
really long time and it blends
everything out so well so the Mac 217 is
one of my faves as well as this Mac 239
this is kind of like the 217 but it has
a more shape to it and it's a little bit
more dense as you can see so that's what
looks like it's kind of like more of a
pinched shorter version of the 217 this
brush I like to use like in my crease or
in the outer V just to really smoke it
out if I want something that's gonna
blend really well in a precise area this
is the way to go so I love this for like
right in the crease just smoking
something out and I also like it all
over the lid if I need to use it for
that next up is the Mac 242
this is essential for packing on lid
color I feel like this changes the game
there has never been another brush that
works like this it just picks up the
product beautifully lays it down I mean
it is just the best flat brush I've ever
used in my life it's not too thick it's
not too thin it's literally perfect I
have nothing bad to say about it
I have two Mac 242 s that I go back and
forth with I feel like I need like 50
more I love this shape as well because
it is kind of rounded right here so I
can really round out the crease I just
creates that a nice cut effect
this is the best pencil brush I've ever
found it's the Mac 219 the letters are
kind of wearing off a it blends out
really well but it's not a stiff hard
pencil brush you know how sometimes
there's some pencil brushes that are
really pointy and it kind of hurts to
blend out your lower lash line this is
not like that it's kind of like a fatter
pencil brush but it does kind of go to
that point as well and it just blends
everything out so beautifully oh and
also if you're wondering what the
indents are right there Rose got a hold
of this when she was a puppy
this is how long I've had this brush oh
she got a hold of it and like chewed it
but I could not let it go love this one
the shape is perfect I think this is
just the perfect pencil brush because
it's not too harsh the bristles are
really nice and
and it also keeps its shape as well so
I've watched these Mac brushes so many
times and they go back to the same shape
and they're just they're worth the money
in my opinion for how many years I've
had these brushes they're so great next
up we have this brush is the Laura
Mercier
secret camouflage brush I'm guessing
this is just the concealer brush I love
this to carve out my brows it's just
that a nice flat brush and it goes to a
really intense point which I love for my
brows because I could sit there and
really carve them out I need a good
brush like this for my brows because
using pencils and stuff I've had to
clean them up quite a bit I think this
is a must-have but if you don't want to
spend the money on it I'm sure there's
other alternatives
I actually just filmed a video using
Amazon brushes so stay tuned for that
but this is definitely one of my
favorites okay let's get onto Sigma I so
use Sigma's tool of Sigma I think they
have some of the best brushes I've used
them since I pretty much started my
channel I think when I first started my
channel I was using Sedona lace and then
I went to Sigma and then I just kind of
troubled everywhere after that I will be
honest I don't buy brushes too often I
usually just keep what I have because I
don't need like 3000 brushes on my
collection it's just not necessary these
are the four from Sigma that I love this
one is perfect because it is just a
really small precision brush this is the
performance Sigma blending a 36 so you
can see how small it is this is just
perfect to get right into the crease if
you have a shade you don't want all over
the lid this can really get right in
there like if you want to blend out your
cut crease or something this gets right
into the socket and really blends it out
it's not gonna blend it out all over the
place it's just gonna be nice and
precise and stay in that crease the
perfect length it's the perfect shape I
just I think it's a great brush this
one's kind of an essential for me umm
this is the Sigma large shader e60 this
is just what I use to apply my all-over
eyelid color like just to set my
eyeshadow base it's just a nice big
brush that it takes no time to you know
dust your eyeshadow on this grabs
product really nicely and distributes it
really well I just love the shape of it
again is that like nice rounded tip and
it literally takes in like two seconds
to put eyeshadow all over my lid when I
use this brush in these two we have the
e-40 and then the e35 these are just
essential
blending brushes for me I love them so
much they just do the same thing pretty
much they just blend I shot it into the
crease really well if you want to
all-over crease shade this is the way to
go
say you're doing a really light look and
you just want to throw bronzer in the
crease these would be perfect for you
you just go windshield wiper and you're
good to go it blends out any harsh lines
anything like that they're just they're
just essential so they're a little bit
bigger than the Mac 217
so the 217 is a little bit smaller as
you can see in a little bit more precise
this one's definitely for like all over
the lid to create that transition shade
and really just blend out product and
this is more of like a precise blending
application like say you would go in
with your transition shade with this one
then you would go below that with this
brush to be a little bit more precise
but still blend it out really well love
those love Sigma I still use them
because I think they're fabulous oh this
is another Sigma brush and the letters
are coming off so that's how you know I
use it all the time this is a sigma e35
this is essential again for me I love
this brush to use to press up really
dark shades right against my lower lash
line so I don't like it to go too low I
mean let's let's not get crazy I do love
a good smoky eye and sometimes I drag my
darker eyeshadows down but this is
really great if you just want to press
some darker shadows right up against
that lower lash line and then you can go
in with a pencil brush and blend that
out with a different color just to
diffuse it and smoke it out a little bit
more I just think this is great for that
it's my favorite brush I feel like if I
go in with the pencil brush it's a
little too much dark color underneath
there I like that I have the ability to
build up the darker shades on my lower
lash line and really get this as close
to those lower lashes as possible and
not get it like everywhere you know what
I'm saying and then the other one that I
love this is a Sephora Pro brow if you
are a pomade kind of person I think this
is really great elf
also has one I can't find it anywhere
but they also have a brow brush it's
really similar to this pretty much like
a little dupe but this is a really great
brow brush again this is the Sephora pro
number 20
great for pomades if you're looking for
something with a spoolie on the end
which I love I've always loved to have a
spoolie on the end and then flip around
and be able to do my brows it's just my
personal preference I don't really like
going to two separate brushes so I love
this
one I just kind of store it however and
I think it's great let's get on to the
fun stuff which is the face brushes and
they're all dirty let's start off with
foundation brushes so my two favorite
foundation brushes when I want to use a
brush is these two so this one is my
favorite but my least favorite of the
two and it's the it couple these are all
by it cosmetics huh yeah oh this is the
it cosmetics heavenly skin brush I guess
for CC skin perfecting I don't know this
came with some foundation that I didn't
like but I really love the brush it just
really blends everything out so it's
just blot my face this just blends
everything out so well it is a little
bit more dense and it has kind of like
that rounded end I find that I don't get
brushstrokes with this and it just
really just really worked so well I love
it so much it works with so many
different foundations and I've just I've
really been enjoying this and then we
have my baby this is such a go brush
it's like a kabuki on a stick it's
amazing it's the it cosmetics heavenly
luxe a flat top buffing foundation these
bristles are dense but they're not too
dense they really have good movement to
them there's a lot of bristles in this
brush and I just I love it it's super
soft I love how flat it is and it is a
little bit bigger than this heavenly one
so it covers a larger area and I just I
don't know man this is like a magic wand
for your foundation it just blends so
well syncs everything into the skin it
pulls up any extra product that you
don't need and I just I love it I love
this brush it has been a while since
I've been like truly in love with one
and this is taking my heart it's one of
the best so highly recommend it I know
it's expensive but if you're looking for
a really good brush this is the way to
go next up let's talk about powder this
has been my favorite powder brush this
is the Too Faced @mr right brush I just
really like it I love that it's a little
bit pointed right here and it gets right
underneath my eyes are very very well it
sets everything so beautifully and it
doesn't like poke me in the eye
it doesn't like take away foundation and
stuff with it you know when you're
wiping away bake or something sometimes
brushes can
move your foundations with the powder
this does not do that I just think it's
the perfect brush and I also love the
handle because it goes down to like a
thinner handle that way I can store it
easily so I really love this brush I use
it all the time there's so many
airplanes going on today I also like to
blend out like my contour my bronzer
with this it's just a great
multi-purpose brush next up we have this
drugstore one this is the MUA
professionals stippling brush this
stippling brush is key key for blending
out blush and bronzer like to melt them
all together this is the way to go if
you have an issue on your face that you
need to blend out you need this brush
this is like the best drugstore brush
I've ever had it has such a long handle
too it's like very sleek and nice
especially for a drugstore brush and it
really just blends everything out so
well I use this constantly you guys have
probably seen us so many times in my
videos it keeps its shape as well no
matter how much I wash it and it has
it's like not one of those like a basic
B brushes you know what I'm saying it
has a good amount of bristles on it so
it really does blend everything out it's
definitely not one of those flimsy
duo-fiber brushes that you can get I
love this highly recommend it from the
drugstore I got mine at CVS another one
I love for bronzer is a newfound
favorite this is from Soho I don't know
what the name is but I did get it at the
PX which I'm pretty sure you can get
Soho I like Target and stuff I love this
brush because the bristles are a little
bit more rough and I really like this
for bronzer I feel like it blends it out
really well and I think a lot of these
brushes just depends on my mood like
what kind of mood I'm in for the day if
I want more of a precise bronzer
application I will go for this if I want
something a little bit more like blown
out all over just to really give me a
nice tan I will go for the Sonia Kashuk
well I think about this Sonia Kashuk one
is it does come in a set and not by
itself the set is nice but I don't use
those brushes all the time so just keep
that in mind but it is a really good
brush but if I want more of a precise
bronzer application I'll go for this
because it just fits perfectly on my
cheek and right there on my forehead
where I need to bronze so I love this I
think the handle is really great too
it's really comfortable to you okay this
is like my go-to a blush brush because
I've purchased other blush brushes even
from Sigma and they have
not been this fluffy and this amazing
and I've had this rush for years so
freaking long and I just cannot part
with it it's the Sigma large angled
contour f40 do you see how fluffy this
little guy is he's so fluffy he just
fits perfectly on my cheekbones I'm
telling you this is just the perfect
blush brush I've purchased another f40
before and it was super thin and like
didn't really blend out very well so I
don't know what happened with that but I
haven't had the guts to like buy another
one so I've just been using this one for
years it's my favorite can't be without
it for blush it's just that perfect I
mean this is like a staple just your
regular blush brush applies beautifully
blends beautifully next up I want to
talk about this little guy this is from
it cosmetics as well it is the this is
the blurring concealer blush there's
like Daisy hair all over these brushes
so this is a blurring concealer brush
and I love this for the inner corners of
my eye and also if I need to take I
shadow primer all over my lid I'll use
this or if I just want to go ahead and
take the concealer all over the lid I'll
drag it up there as well but I love this
brush because it really fits right here
in the inner corner perfectly it's
imperative that I apply concealer here
in the inner corner because I get so
dark there but I can't use my fingers
cuz these nails so I have to use a brush
and this one is perfect it is just so
easy to go in tap it out and then you're
done I also use this for under-eye
powder sometimes if I really feel like I
need to set that under-eye concealer
like super close to my lower lash line I
will use this brush because it just sits
right underneath there it will press it
in perfectly and it's just beautiful
Real Techniques I do love this set I
forget what the set is it's like a face
brush set I believe but I love this to
contour sometimes you'll see me
contouring with this I just think it's
great this is I believe the setting
brush keep in mind you can use brushes
for whatever you feel works for you I
mean if it says blush brush but you like
it for bronzer you like it to contour
you could do whatever you want you know
what I'm saying it's makeup it all
washes off so I like to use this one to
contour and I never really set
underneath my eyes or anything I just
use this to chisel out to my cheek bone
and then this one I love just another
multi-purpose brush I mean I can use it
for powder I can use
bronzor just really fluffy really soft
again has that rounded end the handles
are really nice I do think they're a
little thick they need to be a little
bit smaller so I could put more into the
container but it is really nice I love
the real technique line I think they
have such great products these are
little pricey but I really feel like
you're getting such great quality for
your money and I've had these crushes
for such a long time I think since Real
Techniques came out as a long time last
step let's talk about this highlighting
brush we have the Anastacio a23
highlighting brush I just love this
brush I had another one before and I
lost it I don't know what happened to it
but I just think this is the perfect
size perfect shape for highlighting it's
just the best so this is what it looks
like it is a little pricey but I promise
you you will not regret it it just
applies that highlight right to the top
of your cheekbone it holds just enough
product it doesn't get too much product
it's just beautiful and I love it
okay guys so those are my brush favorite
I've used these brushes for so freaking
long most of them for years and they're
also going strong and they are always
the ones that I travel with so I really
hope you guys enjoyed this and found it
helpful thank you guys so much for
