today I'm going to be sharing with you
my favorite drugstore foundations I have
a quite a few here to share with you
guys that I love I feel like my
drugstore foundation collection has
really like stepped it up and I have a
lot of good stuff to share with you so
if you have oily skin sensitive skin you
want foundations that are going to cover
up your problem areas
I got you because I'm always on the hunt
for the next best thing at the drugstore
especially when it comes to foundations
and also concealers I don't remember the
last time they'd be like a drugstore
favorites video but I figured I would
start out with favorite foundations I
thought a lot of you asked me lately
what my favorite drugstore foundation is
so I just wanted to come on here and
share it with you guys so if you're
interested it definitely keep watching
and don't forget to subscribe before you
leave if you're not already and give it
a thumbs up if you like this video and
yeah let's just go ahead and get started
okay so the first one I want to talk
about is one that most of you know that
I absolutely adore
I just think this is such a great
foundation and it looks so good on the
skin and this is like kind of oldie but
goodie it's the Sonia Kashuk a soft
focus satin matte foundation you can get
this at Target
I believe this ranges from like 14 15
dollars which is a little bit more
pricey for the drugstore but this is a
really great foundation it's very
lightweight but it covers beautifully
this really does give you a nice
beautiful satin matte finish and it
doesn't enhance your pores or anything
like that and it lasts for such a long
time the only downfall and of course is
some of these products as well is the
shade range is not that great they don't
have a ton of different shades but if
you can find your shade in this I would
highly recommend it I will say one thing
about all these foundations a lot of
these foundations do the same thing for
me as in like they blur my pores or they
last awhile they look good on the skin
but I just want to share with you my
favorites and the ones that I have found
in the drugstore that I think are
amazing and then you could cut it go off
of what I love and see if you were to
try it out or not this one is one I will
always say in my drawer I love this and
I highly recommend it so the next one is
one that when I first tried it I was so
surprised because I was sure I was not
going to like this foundation but I
loved it
this is flawless it's the Maybelline
Dream matte mousse
and I have a couple shades in this this
one's in the shade light beige medium
zero and I personally love to use this
with a brush
I feel like this honestly makes you look
insanely smooth it does not enhance
texture it does not enhance your pores
it is just the most flawless canvas ever
I'm not even kidding I did not think I
was going like this I actually purchased
new liquid one and I'll be getting that
in the mail very soon so I'm going to do
a full face in Maybelline I feel like
this is something that a lot of people
don't talk about but it is such a really
great foundation and it lasts for such a
long time and you don't need that much
product so I recommend a flat brush kind
of something like this you can use
whatever you prefer
and you can just buff it into the skin
and it looks beautiful so again this is
the Maybelline Dream matte mousse this
is awesome and it really does keep you
mat but it's not a dry matte formula it
feels so comfortable in skin and it is
very very lightweight next one I want to
talk about is the flower Beauty BB cream
and I know you're probably thinking this
is the foundations video a wives BB
cream in here but that's because this
has the coverage of a full coverage
foundation and it's insane the first
time I ever used this was on the
Facebook live and I was like oh my god
it feels really good on the skin it's a
little bit more hydrating but if you
said with a powder it will last all day
long again the shade range of this
really does kind of stuff but I wanted
to mention this to guys because it is a
great product is very travel friendly
it's in a little squeezy tube and you
need the littlest amount for a ton of
coverage so I personally love it I think
if you have normal to combo skin you'll
love it as well as oily to the holy girl
and I love this product and it's so easy
to wear I know again this is the flower
beauty BB cream next up is one of my
favorite foundations you can get that
old ties you can now get it at Target I
believe it is the soap &amp;amp; Glory one heck
of a blot always a liquid to powder
foundation this looks so good all of
these look great on the skin I would
recommend anything to you that would
look terrible on the skin you know what
I'm saying like I feel like these
products looks amazing on texture pores
and what I love the most about this is
actually brand new bottle it has 12 hour
long wear technology i 100% agree with
that it lasts for such a long time if
you're going out
highly recommend this one and it says it
has super blur powers which I agree with
again does not accentuate your pores
this one is just so smooth and it does
go to a matte finish so if you don't
like a matte finish you will definitely
not like this but this is one of the
best for oily skin your oils don't like
see-through and lay on top of the
foundation I absolutely hate it when
that happens
that happens to me all the freaking time
this one really does keep the oil under
control and doesn't make you look shiny
for the longest time I wouldn't say
keeps you shine free for 12 hours but I
would say it's good six to eight at
least for me so these two aren't really
mattifying but they work really well for
oily skin the first one is this
maybelline superstay better skin skin
transforming foundation I keep saying
this ivory product the like is the
favorite video right this is such a good
foundation now you do need to set this
if you have oily skin because it will
make you a little bit shiny but it
really does look like a second layer of
skin and when you set this it does go
down to the matte finish because you did
put powder on top I do find that I do
have to blot with this one but the way
it makes my skin look it just looks
refreshed its healthy it's like a
natural glow it's not luminous and it's
not matte it's that perfect in between
it's not even like a satin matte it just
looks so gorgeous on the skin and I feel
like this is a great everyday foundation
but then you can also take it to the
nighttime and have something full
coverage this is a medium to full
coverage product I don't know if I
mentioned it with this one but this one
is full coverage full coverage medium to
full I really love this one I just like
the way it sits on my skin and I highly
recommend it and it has a pump and it's
from the drugstore okay this next one is
a new found favorite that you guys knew
I was going to include in this video
it's the covergirl vitalist healthy
elixir foundation I don't know about you
other oily girls out there but what I
heard about this foundation I for sure
thought no and then I don't know its
luminance everybody says they look super
dewy all day and I was like I'm not
about that I don't want that on my face
you know because me I know some people
like to have a luminous glow even if
they are oily or if you're oily you like
super matte I'll kind of go in-between I
just have to find the right product
that's not going to make me a greaseball
by the end of the day because you know
there are some matte foundations that
will make you very greasy
then there are of course women as ones
that make you look super greasy as well
so it's just about finding that perfect
product that's going to lay on top and
not make you look crazy this is awesome
because this is like my luminous
foundation and I go like this because if
you're dry I feel like this wouldn't be
super luminous on you unless you just
didn't set it with a powder but I do set
this with a powder it gives you a
healthy glow again it's that medium to
full coverage I love to apply this with
a brush and a sponge I love both tools
but I personally love the brush a little
bit more right now just because I like
using a flat top brush to really buff it
out I just think it's easy its quick and
it really sets it into the skin nicely I
know some people have said that this
oxidizes on their skin I will say I
don't think it's yeah it's not this one
the one above this I think I have 70 45
I use that when I'm very self tan but I
don't mind as I describe myself but I
use that when I'm very selves hand and
it does oxidize a little bit not too
much I do notice it gets a little bit
darker so it's best for me to mix a
lighter shade with it but it isn't
really great shade it doesn't oxidize
like super orange it's just a little bit
darker on my skin let me know what you
guys think down below in the comments if
you've tried it did it go Orange how
does it look on you though this was $10
I got at the PX I don't know if it's the
same price everywhere it probably is
probably isn't I'm not sure I love this
and it's so again comfortable on the
skin not heavy whatsoever I wore this on
HSN camera-friendly looked stunning did
essentially pores texture you know the
drills didn't do any of that so
absolutely love this product as well
these are like my top foundations right
now I don't know how I went through this
whole video and forgot be wet and wild
photo focus foundation I didn't know but
that is one of my all-time favorites as
well it's super affordable I'll leave it
down below in the description box you
need it in your life it is literally one
of the best as well and it's so hard I
feel like sometimes to find really good
foundations I mean I tried some really
bad high-end foundations like one that I
was trying recently with a girl on
foundation that I mentioned to my hips
and misses it wasn't absolutely terrible
because it looked beautiful on the skin
when I first applied it
after about four or five hours it was
just breaking up so bad on my skin and
it just looked awful but then I go back
to these foundations that are like less
than half the price and I know these are
going to work for me I know they're
going to last all day long and I'm not
going to make my skin look terrible you
know if I'm having a really bad skin day
I can still use these products let me
know your drugstore favorites down below
what's your skin type even if you don't
have oily skin let us know in the
comments what your favorite drugstore
foundation is because I know a lot of
people are interested to know thank you
so much for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video bye
