today I figured I would do a spring
makeup tutorial using some of my
favorite long-wear products and just
kind of the look that I'm going for for
spring you know there's a lot of new
products out like great products at that
and a lot of skincare that I like to
incorporate as well into my routines and
just some different products oh I don't
know what happened here it's like my
self-tanner got weird
I've been masking my neck for the past
like a few days um with like an
expensive mask and I'm like is this from
sweating or what is this from because
this is all my self-tanner just like
blushing up so let's not let's not focus
on that don't forget to subscribe before
you leave and hit that post notification
bell so you don't miss out on any of my
videos and yeah we're just gonna go
ahead and get started so first off let's
talk about skincare I did go ahead and
cleanse my skin right now so I did use
this Dior micellar milk no rinse
cleanser I love this stuff this is a
really really big bottle and it's great
for if you don't want to wash your face
again like if you wake up in the morning
and you're bout to go to the gym but you
want to cleanse your skin this is a
great product for that I have super
sensitive skin like ultra sand stiff
does not make my redness flare up or
anything it doesn't sting so that's why
I really like this product it's gentle
it's cleansing you don't have to rinse
it off it's great I just use it with
some Ulta cotton round so after that I
went in with is in balancing Essex this
facial treatment essence this is new for
me okay I'm trying this out I've only
used it for like a week and I've gone
down that much so I really need to calm
down I did go ahead and use this today
as well after I plans to my skin it just
feels really good and I need to do more
research on essence but supposed to be
really good for you so I've been using
it before I've been really liking it
it's nice and soothing and I really just
feel like my skin's like and then after
that I did go in with this belief
moisturizing eye balm oh my gosh you
guys this is a new purchase for me you
would have seen my Sephora haul and my
returns before you're watching this
video this is so good my skin just
drinks this up it's so nice my makeup
lays on top of this beautifully I
normally use this at night but I will
use it in the day sometimes as well as
I'm feeling like my
they're a little bit dry and just need a
little something extra they went in with
the origins ginseng energy boosting gel
moisturizer this is great really like
plumps up the skin feels really good and
it smells delicious for sunscreen I did
use this Akula mineral sunscreen this
the cucumber matte finished one it has
SPF 30 highly recommended SPF for spring
and summer actually year-round I use SPF
year-round but this is a matte finish so
if you have oily skin and you kind of
just want to make sure it's not super
greasy because sometimes SPF for your
face can be a little bit heavy they can
break you out this one does not break
you out it feels really good on the skin
gives you that SPF 30 and like it says
it is a matte finish so that's what my
skin looks pretty matte right now this
is the last step that I use for my
skincare today my skincare I have like
two sets of skin care I have the one
where I wash my skin and then I have the
one where I use my no rinse cleanser so
this is the no rinse cleanser skincare
routine that you guys are seeing it just
depends on my mood it depends on what
I'm doing if I have enough time to wash
my face all of that kind of stuff I know
it's like a lot of products but I just
like to put moisture back into my skin
give myself some SPF but you guys will
be seeing a skincare routine a for
morning and night very soon I think I'm
gonna do a daytime routine or like a
morning routine and a nighttime routine
stay tuned for that
so moving on we're gonna start with eyes
first now for eyes I like to keep my eye
looks pretty simple for spring and of
course I like the warm tone that's just
who I am as a person I know some of you
get so over warm toned makeup looks but
I just love them so I'm gonna use a
couple of new products that you guys
have not seen yet right now I am using
these Smashbox photo-finish lid primer
and light this does have a tint to it
this has been one of my favorite primers
if you have very oily eyelids
I recommend the NARS eyeshadow primer
because it seriously is so amazing for
oily eyelids it keeps them nice and
matte literally your eyeshadow will not
crease with that primer it is so good
go check it out if you're having an
issue so the eyeshadow palette we're
gonna be using today is this new one
from Marc Jacobs it is the the fantasy
nigh conic palette so it looks like this
I'm going to be mainly
this one for the mats I did use this
color the other day before I went out on
a date night with Davis and it's a
pretty color but holy fallout I would
use your finger with that for sure I had
already had my full face that makeup on
and it was getting everywhere and I was
like another thing I'll be using today
is the new Tarte chrome paints they came
out with this one called froze a beach
bay
Sandridge I think I'm gonna go with
froze a so we will see like I said we're
gonna use the maps in this palette so
the first one I'm gonna be taking is
this lighter shade I'm going to set my
entire lid just to make sure nothing
moves it has really pretty colors in it
and it's super compact so I can take
this one I'm traveling I'm actually pre
filming a lot of videos right now so
that I can leave this is gonna go with
me for sure next color I'm gonna take is
this one right here and I'm just going
to fluff that into the crease so for
spring I like more of a lighter look I
like warm tone looks obviously I know a
lot of you want me to do more cool tone
looks which I will try I just don't like
them for me I feel like every time I do
a cool tone look I just don't like the
way it looks on me lighter eye looks not
a lot of eyeliner no winged liner
actually if you like I haven't been
doing winged liner a lot recently and
I've been really enjoying it same with
lashes I'm kind of doing lighter lashes
and I actually wore glossy lips out the
other night when I went on my date night
and I was filling it because I love
tarts new bosses that you guys will see
in this video and it wasn't that one day
I also had my hair in a ponytail so I
was loving it and I'm also cuz I'm going
to Georgia here soon so I'm gonna take
these glosses with me and rock them
while I can because it is so windy here
at drum I say it every time I talk about
gloss but seriously I wore that tart
gloss and I was like god I wish it
wasn't so windy here because I would
wear it a lot more at last all day like
it lasted throughout dinner and I was
eating like a healthy Bowl thing at this
restaurant had a beer it was great and
then the next shade I'm gonna use is
this one right here but I'm gonna use a
different brush with it
what kind of videos do you guys wanna
see for me please let me know I know how
I do you were like no one does makeup
tutorials and I agree I don't do a lot
of makeup tutorials I like more reviews
I like I'm starting to try to do more
vlog channel stuff too so like lifestyle
things I'm gonna do a spring clothing
haul for you guys let me know what you
guys want to see it I also need to do
some foundation reviews full face to
first impressions I love those videos I
named in my favorites video ooh I got to
do that before I leave got a lot of
videos to film for you guys but if you
have any requests always let me know
what they are down below in the comments
even whenever I post my videos in my
like community section please comment on
that if you have any requests so these
two colors are so pretty together it's
just so girly and pretty and I love it
and they're not too intense at all this
one does have a bit of a sheen but I
don't think it's too much for this look
but this is literally all been doing
when it's warmer outside now I'm gonna
take one of these new colors from Tarte
this is the chrome paint in froze eh
I really love these chrome paints they
are so intense and pretty I'm guessing
they started pressing them because they
did have them loose which I'm happy they
started pressing because the loose like
powders were driving me insane this is
what it looks like when you get it you
have this little guy which if you've
ever had the L'Oreal eyeshadows like
this like where they're pressed it's
like the same exact thing this is a
color I actually might mix a little bit
of a gold in here to like make it pop in
the center we'll see but I'm gonna put
this color all over my lid because I
love a good shimmery lid just makes me
so happy so pretty actually I might not
need a gold I thought this is gonna be a
little bit darker but that is yeah
that's stunning so I'm kind of just
carving out the crease
as I do this I'm gonna take a brown
eyeliner now this one from Marc Jacobs
I've been really loving this one's in
the shade brownie I'm gonna line my
upper lash line and then I'm gonna take
my pencil brush and blend that out so we
kind of have more of a smokey look
nothing too precise
so I'm lightly pulling my eye you don't
have to do that you can do it without
doing that but I'm just gonna be
softening this up just like that super
super simple adds a little something
extra now we're gonna do is apply these
Ardell double-up whispies and then i'll
be right back
and then we will move on to face ok guys
so don't mind the lashes they are drying
I put a clear glue on since I do have
that eyeliner down so it takes a little
bit longer to dry at least I feel like
duo clear lash glue does so that's
what's going on there now we're gonna
move on to the skin first things first
obviously for spring and summer gotta
have the coconut scented primer water I
don't know why I couldn't spit that out
but anything that reminds me of summer
it's just smells so good I am so ready
for like days it's not even funny you
also store this product in your fridge
if you want something that's super
refreshing I would totally do that if I
had a fridge up here but I don't so two
favorite primers at the moment touches
silk canvas this is the filter finished
protective primer I've been really
enjoying this for a while now I went
back and forth with it like do I really
love it yes I love it this is a staple
for our spring and summer this is became
an austin primer protect mattifying
primer has SPF 30 has tint to it I want
to wear it by itself you totally could
do that as well does keep you nice and
matte but not a dry matte which is what
I really love about this this is another
primer that I love if you have redness
and you're just really wanting to tone
that down and not wear makeup throughout
the day this is a great product to have
like this underneath makeup but it's not
super mattifying to the point that I can
wear on a hot summer day oh this is
something I would wear if I know I'm
gonna be inside more not outside and the
heat like crazy I would pack this in my
lake bag to have just to like toned
some redness that I have so actually
today I am gonna use this one because I
want to tone down some of this redness
that I have right now and is a very
green primer they are not sponsoring
this video again the first one they did
sponsor but not this one and tell you
guys I don't do sponsorships unless I
love it though you could see right there
it just really tones down the redness
and it smooths out the skin so nicely so
I'm gonna be out during the day I would
either go for the cane and Austin one or
the Tasha one because I find that this
does not make me a Lee it actually helps
keep my foundations matte it's not a
mattifying primer whatsoever it's more
for pores but it doesn't make me super
greasy throughout the day you know what
I'm saying I could do a full video on
foundations that I recommend for you
guys for heat oily skin large pores
texture all of that I could do a full
video if you want to see that so
definitely let me know in the comments
here are some of my favorites this is
the one I'll be using today this is the
huda beauty foe filter high coverage
foundation
wow wow wow this is good another one
that is great is the Too Faced peach
perfect foundation Estee Lauder Double
Wear hands down if you're sweating have
a long day you just need your makeup
stay on this one this is a must-have lot
of the LA girl Pro matte this is another
really great foundation for oily skin
and if you're hot or anything like that
this is gonna be such a great one and
then as well as the hourglass vanish
stick foundation which I would use this
if again you're not going to be outside
as much if you have oily skin because
this is not a mattifying foundation at
all but it is so beautiful I can't pass
it up so really great especially with
the perfect primer like I said I'm gonna
be using this Hood of beauty so filter1
I have been back in love with this you
guys obsessed with it it's so good I
wore this when I was in Georgia and ever
since then I've been wearing it non-stop
it's just full coverage it lasts all day
which is what I need and it looks
beautiful on the skin I'm using the
shade 300 in right now and I'm using my
Real Techniques sponge and we're just
going to balloon this out all over I
mean this is a high coverage product
it's so
it doesn't irritate my skin it does not
break me out so you can see that
foundation is just flawless especially
with those primers underneath I mean
even with just the Smashbox one just the
touch I want is such a beautiful
beautiful product and I love it so much
and I get compliments every time I wear
this I have a set concealer routine that
I've been doing and then I've been
loving I have been using the k'kaw
concealer in number six as well as my
Tarte shape tape which I can't follow as
well as my heart-shaped tape in light
neutral I like to use Tarte in the inner
corners to really get that darkness and
cover it up also a little bit in the
inner part right here on my nose and
then I take the k'kaw concealer in
number six I've been loving this in the
brightening powder which you guys will
see and put this on the outer parts to
really highlight and add extra coverage
I've been loving this product like
literally it's starting to go down can
you guys see this so we're just gonna
blintz out the same sponge these are all
super full coverage products but they
lay beautifully on top of each other no
a lot of people love like lightweight
light coverage stuff for spring and
summer but I'm more of like light eyes
still beat face kind of person you know
just what I do you could totally alter
it to whatever you prefer redness on my
skin though just does not look good with
medium coverage products like it looks
like I have asked my makeup and I'm just
I don't accept that I don't know what
light coverage is do one more pass over
with our sponge I think one of my
biggest tips is really just making sure
you're going over everything on your
face getting excess product off making
sure everything's really pushed into the
skin that way you don't start looking
cakey throughout the day another big
thing for me is setting my face I have
to set my face my entire face I cannot
set just my under eyes and be done I'm
an oily oily oily person I just can't do
that I'm gonna be taking this Marc
Jacobs perfecting coconut setting powder
this does have a tint to it it's just
like a yellow tint mine is dirty AF cuz
I like this
I know it's terrible has this net and
it's just so much faster if I just do
that I like to apply powder with a
sponge I find that it gives me more of a
very smooth filtered finish instead of
using a brush I've been doing that for a
while now
I don't know something about it it just
works and I would also apply it with a
sponge if you're feeling like your face
is looking super cakey from all the
powder you're putting on go set that
thing in place it's just really gonna
help you throughout the day like your
makeup not move everything just locked
in and honestly it gives me like the
most filtered look to my skin I just all
these products together are so bomb I
really make sure I get underneath that
lower lash line too just so we don't get
any creasing underneath the eyes I
notice a lot of products for like my
spring makeup looks but you could
totally - out things that you feel like
are not worth it for your routine that
is totally fine I just love makeup and
if I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it the
way I like I'm gonna be taking this
k'kaw brightening powder in the shape
too and I'm also gonna be using this
morphe brush and I'm going to put this
underneath my eyes and this is just
going to brighten you up this does not
look cakey on the skin it just simply
adds quite a bit of brightness onto your
face I feel like you look at it and
you're like okay whatever but know this
like really highlights the face I mean
it's just beautiful and it's really good
I take it like down the sides of my nose
on the bridge of my nose down the center
of my face right here and it just really
brings back some life into your skin and
you really don't have to apply a lot to
get a really gorgeous brightening effect
moving on to bronzer favorite bronzer of
the moment to make me look like I am
naturally tan is the Anastasia rosewood
bronzer this is so so so good I'm gonna
be using this one this brush right here
just from Sonia Kashuk I get a lot of
questions about it I got it in a set a
long time ago and it's just been one of
those brushes I go back and forth with I
really love it for bronzer so I'm just
gonna take this bronzer everywhere like
look at the difference with bronzer no
bronzer
I love bronzer how many times can say it
I don't really contour my forehead but I
do add bronzer up there so it kind of
gives that effect
um that I have a smaller forehead I used
to be so self-conscious about it but now
I've seen myself so many times on
YouTube and like Mike you know what I
like that forehead a lot of room for
activities moving on to contour I'm
gonna take this Too Faced natural face
palette I've been loving this as well
there's so many things I'm loving
recently that are high-end
I kind of go through phases I'm like I
find a ton of drugstore stuff that I
love and then I start finding a lot of
high-end stuff that I love and I'm just
like oh I'm gonna take the sunny honey
bronzer in this palette and I'm going to
contour with this hold on there's a
daisy here anybody else
dog hair randomly all over their face so
using this morphe tin five-10 I think
people use this to highlight but I'm
just using it to contour and to chisel
out these cheeks so we're just gonna
work this out I'm gonna take my lip pen
tastes like chocolate
Too Faced and their flavors man don't
eat the makeup but I got some flavors my
back into that Too Faced palette I am
going to take this shade right here very
very lightly just just a tiny bit and
we're going to put this on our cheeks
and this will just give us a really
pretty flush all right now I'm gonna
take that brush again and we're going to
lightly blend just so it doesn't look
crazy for highlight I've been loving the
Omri Z on Stassi highlight but today I'm
going to use the NYX born to glow
highlight palette and I'm gonna do like
a mixture of these two something just
really golden and intense
this is an intense palette put this on
my cheeks oh my god it is so pretty this
is like such a gorgeous spring/summer
color because it's just like gold and
pretty intense for brows I'm going to
use my trusty crease ultra-slim Matic
brow pencil is very creamy long wearing
and they look great on the brows
X I'm going to take that Marc Jacobs
eyeliner that we used earlier and I'm
going to put this on my lower waterline
this reminds me so much of Costa Rica
from Mac which I want to get again
because that honestly makes brown eyes
pop but this one does to men what we're
gonna do is we're going to go back into
Marc Jacobs palette and I'm actually
gonna take this color right here and I'm
gonna push this right up against that
lower lash line right up close there
then we're gonna use a pencil brush and
we're going to go in with this shade
right here and just blend that out we're
also going to connect that to the outer
half of the eye so all around here
really smoking it out
next up I'm gonna take that same NYX
highlighter palette in the gold shade
that we used and I'm going to highlight
underneath my brow so also in the inner
corner such a difference
I love highlighter in the inner corner
it just looks so pretty okay now we're
gonna move on to lips lips are pretty
easy I'm just going to use this Mac
boldly bare lip pencil and line my lips
and then for lip gloss I'm going to be
using the Tarte h2o gloss in the shade
hang-ten I absolutely love these glasses
they are so glossy and beautiful I used
them in a previous video and you guys
are like oh music lost more often and I
was like I know it's so good and I
really love the way these look I like
the way these feel because they're not
super sticky but they're very very
glossy like they look wet on your lips
it's amazing which is why I can see why
it's called h2o gloss isn't really
pretty like everyday nude like you just
need to line your lips and you have
gloss but this is the spring makeup look
that I did I love this makeup look it's
something really glowy and pretty for
spring something that's not too intense
there's no winged eyeliner there's just
a little bit of liner on the upper
lashes
fluttery lashes from the drugstore a
nice glossy lip glowy skin but still
full coverage so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching let me know down below what you
guys want to see next and I will see you
all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
