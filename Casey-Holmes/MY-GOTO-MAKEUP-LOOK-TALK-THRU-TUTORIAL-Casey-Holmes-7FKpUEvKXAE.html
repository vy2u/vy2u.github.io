would get ready with you and show you my
life get your makeup on and get out the
door look that I like to do this is not
using like BB creams or anything like
that this is just like - about a bunch
of different things that I normally do
when I apply my makeup and ever I do
wear makeup I like to have a nice full
coverage finish at least a full coverage
base and then light on the iPad a lot of
you request me to do this so I figured I
would go ahead and film another one for
you especially since I have some new
products that I've been using don't
forget to subscribe before you leave and
let's just go ahead and get started okay
so when I do makeup looks that I need to
hurry up and get going which I actually
really do I have some errands to run
today and I need to leave in like an
hour which I'll be done by then but I
have makeup looks that I need to do
quickly I always do my base makeup first
because I keep my eye pretty light so
we're going to go ahead and get started
with that I was actually supposed to go
traveling so I have my makeup bag right
here of all my stuff in it so I'm
probably going to be digging around here
one thing that I do want to try
differently is trying a new face primer
today so I have the Smashbox primer
water you know I love this I just love
it because it hydrates my skin but it
doesn't make me super oily or anything
like that it's just one of my staples I
noticed a difference when I don't use it
so I'm going to be spraying this and
then normally I would use the Cayman
Austen mattifying primer but today I
want to try this Jake at Beauty &amp;amp;
mattifying face primer I just got this
in PR and I was like Oh drugstore
mattifying primer oil-free pore
minimizing I'm going to try this
normally when I do my makeup I love a
full coverage look I love full-on smokey
eyes I love full coverage base just
because I don't wear makeup every single
day like I'm either like a no makeup
kind of girl or I'll do something like
today where I'm doing something lighter
on the eyes or then I'm completely full
glam there's no in-between like I don't
do BB creams or anything like that just
because I'm never happy with the
coverage I'm never happy with the way it
makes my skin look I feel like I might
rather go without anything on my skin
than having a light coverage and you
could still see the rosacea peaking
through that is this oh this is like a
weird huh and makes me nervous I for
sure thought it was gonna be like a
cream or something this is interesting
mmm-hmm this doesn't feel too too hot
this isn't making me think that my is
going to make my foundation slide and
like the foundation is not going to
stick to it I'm going to be using my new
favorite foundation I just did a video
on it's my last one you can see a wear
test and all that but I'm going to be
using the YSL all ours foundation
I dig in a different shade I actually
got the shade sixty amber I thought it
would match my self tan line and it's
too gray for me so I'm going to be
returning this in ordering a different
shade so I'm just going to use the ones
that I showed you guys last time which
is we need sunny actually I'm going to
use honey today because sand is still a
little bit too light for me and then I
am going to put this on with a Beauty
Blender I like this foundation a lot
because it is lightweight I like the
L'Oreal sponge not be blender I'm sorry
but it covers so well I just I really
have been enjoying it I wore it out the
other night as well when Davis and I
went on a date night I wore this and he
really likes it too he thinks it looks
really good on my skin this I'm still
trying it out I'm really trying out a
lot right now since it's kind of like a
wedding contender I also want to try to
mix this with Double Wear and just see
how it looks and I feel like I want to
make a concoction of foundations
I've been trying out so many and a lot
of you ask me if I prefer this over the
hourglass stick foundation think the
hourglass stick foundation is great as
you guys know I really love that
foundation the difference is this one is
light weight especially compared to the
Estee Lauder Double Wear this still
covers a lot but it's just it feels
lighter on the skin don't get me wrong
I love double wear and I loved hourglass
foundation but this one definitely just
feels a little bit better and to me it
looks more like skin this one definitely
keeps me more matte than the hourglass
one eye now we're going to do regular
concealers I like long wearing
concealers whenever I'm out for the day
because usually when I'm running errands
I don't touch-up
so I'm just going to be using my same
old concealers which is Tarte shaped
tape and then Maybelline fit me
I love doing my concealer down like this
because it still brightens up and
highlights the face I also take it on my
lid whenever I am just running errands
because I'm not going to have a lot of
eyeshadow on I don't ever prime my
eyelids with concealer if I'm doing a
full-blown smoky eye or something that I
really want to last all day in that
crease because my eyeshadow will crease
with concealer like it's not a good
primer for me because I have really oily
eyelids so that's just my personal
preference I don't prefer I even said it
with a powder and my oils just come
through on my eyelids I'm just the oily
girl all the way around but on days like
today I just throw a shade into the
crease and then it doesn't really matter
you know if it creases or whatever to me
I can just kind of tighten my fingers
whereas if I had a smoky eye or
something that's more details I'm going
to mess it up if I try to fix it with my
finger so we're not going to set just
yet and I know you probably like what
what are you doing I know I've been
doing cream contour lately I'm actually
going to be using these Smashbox duo
right here I haven't tried the
foundation side of this yet but I really
like the contour side I'm going to be
using the shade 2.3 I have this duo
right here and I just take the lightest
amount because it is pretty dark contour
that 5 widescreen Thuban I haven't used
this foundation side just yet um Davis's
mom actually slashed excite or - you
could pick a shade but this is the shade
2.3 and I've only used the contour but I
do really love the contour side I think
it is awesome I'm using this Tarte brush
to contour and blend everything out you
see how easy that just blend it out like
it's so effortless doesn't like break up
the foundation or anything just gives
you that nice defined cheek
I've also been using the Urban Decay
Naked skin the contour palette with the
cream side I'm using that as well and I
really like it
kind of gives you a nice tan blend out
these edges with the bottom of my Beauty
Blender I'm just going to go around the
edges real quick also kind of take
whatever was left from concealer and
carve out the cheeks okay
so you can see we have some work to the
face and it's contoured and we're good
so now I'm going to use I've been going
back and forth with this Estee Lauder
perfecting loose pattern also the new
Too Faced Born This Way powder I'm like
I've had a bad experience but I've kind
of felt cakey with this at some points
this one I'm kind of nervous to have
flashback so I'm just going back and
forth with both of them but so probably
both of them but for day to day I think
I'm going to use this one actually no I
think I'm gonna use this one since I'm
not taking any pictures I need to take
pictures with it with flash and test it
out so don't quote me on it this has
flash back I'm just taking a wild guess
because of the formula and just how it
applies but we will see I'm going to
just take my sponge first and I'm going
to go underneath my eyes I'm not baking
too much I'm just trying to get right to
that lashline and set it so nothing
creases so we're not really baking here
I've kind of stayed away from baking
isn't that crazy
so mister right brush we're just going
to set the contour and all that now I am
going to this Smashbox step by step a
contour palette and I'm going to use the
more bronzy warm tone shade in here to
just broad up the cheeks
so pretty blend out so well - this one's
the medium one I believe and I also have
a deeper one so if you're interested
they do have a deeper shade a little bit
of here - underneath the cheekbones with
the contour shade in here I'm not going
to do too much I'm just taking a little
Real Techniques fresh stabbing it in you
need a little lift them out anyways to
really carve it out and then I am going
to blend it out with a dual fibre brush
I love more of a bronzey look if I don't
have enough time to really do too much
this duo fiber brush is from mua makeup
academy right yes you can get it - yes
it's really good I use it constantly and
then what I'm going to do really quickly
is I am going to take a little bit more
of a precise brush I like this morphe
one in five to nine and I'm just going
to take this little guy and highlight a
little bit more underneath eyes you see
the brightness that is that just goes
highlights just a little bit more we
have to add a little highlight going to
use the Pearl palette and it was me
you're so sick of me talking about this
look I hit pan on the lighter one I need
like 15 more smashbox so i'm actually
mixed the first two shade apply that i
do like to have highlight on when i'm
running errands I feel like it just
makes a big difference just makes you
glow you know and you can build this up
too if you want it super intense then
I'm also going to take that same contour
palette this is what I do a lot I'll
just take that warm shade in there and
I'll use a fluffy blending brush that
warm tones and throw this into my crease
I'll bring it all the way here in the
inner corner this one thing about like
contour palettes that I love is I use
them a lot for eyeshadow as well as if
I'm traveling I normally just toss
something in like this that way I can
get a nice like warm eye so also contour
when it's like a too
one for me it really does very like what
I want to do sometimes but today I'm
going to contour my nose just a little
bit let me know if you guys have used
this contour and foundation do it I'm
interested to see I have two shades that
I want to try out so maybe I'll do that
in like a first impressions kind of
video okay so now we're going to move on
to brows and what I just I've been
experimenting with brows lately this is
the stroke of rob and using by Ardell
and I do really like it it's just so
easy to use I finally got another shade
taupe and it's just easy to kind of
hurry up and fill them in just haven't
quite mastered using this on its own I
find that I definitely have to go and
look concealer quite a bit to clean up
my brow so I'll probably be doing that
but I just have the hardest time trying
to perfect my brows when it's not with a
pomade but this is really easy to use
and that's why I love it six and less is
it then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to set those brows because I'm not
used to not having a pomade struggle
brow like feather pen it doesn't like
it's not heavy at all it's just
literally painting on your skin pretty
much so I definitely have to set my
brows and to do that is it anything a
microphone do do that I've just been
using this Jeeva she Master brow filler
but honestly you could use anything you
can use the essence brow gel that has a
tint to it benefit gimme brow is great
too
I just need to use it so I purchase it
in like I need to use it up to as
expensive I like using this because it
just lightens up the brows a bit and
then i line my slowly through and just
get all that excess product out so I'm
going to curl my lashes another thing I
like to do is align the upper waterline
right here
what that's going to do is make the base
of your lashes look a lot fuller so
we're going to do that that I have been
using a brown liner recently from pur
cosmetics this is the OnPoint eyeliner
in down to earth I've been really loving
it every yes new my notes on today
that's one thing I'm doing but also
sharpen every time you put it in the cap
so that's really nice I just never show
you guys me lining my upper one
I find it really gross and I'm really
liking brown even though my water line
is just a little less harsh so I've just
been using that I'm going to curl my
lashes and apply this essence volume
stylist lash extension mascara which is
really good really really good I mean
really good like one of those mascaras
that you can wear even if you have more
of a dramatic look you can wear this
because it adds so much to your lashes I
mean like look at that volume see like
at three four dollar mascara and then
last but not least we're going to do
lips
now I want to try this out because I
just purchased it I'm like wondering
what the craze is although this is the
new Pat McGrath lipstick in 1995 it's
matte trance lipstick and it looks
really cool so this is what it looks
like it is super matte kind of like got
a rounded edge to it or just interested
to try it normally I use a liquid lip
the pretty color
so that is pretty much my on-the-go
makeup look you've been it more bronze I
still do my brows I do my lashes okay so
I just added some ways to my hair as an
extra time so I figured I would just go
ahead and do my hair cuz normally I do
my hair and then I don't touch it for a
couple days if you're wondering I still
use this new me thirty two millimeter
wand for a heat protectant I've been
using the way haircare memory mist I
don't notice that this keeps my curls
longer or anything I mean they last
pretty much the same but I do like it as
a heat protectant and then the last
thing that I'm going to do is I'm going
to apply this I G K Beach Club
texturizing spray I like to add a little
bit of grit to my hair if I just washed
it that way it smells so good too but
that way I just have a little bit more
grit you know things aren't flying
around everywhere too much very loosely
curl my hair and that's how I get this
look because you can see even some
strands or straighter than others that's
just because I don't hold it on the iron
for long but that is it for this video
the one thing I will say is I did try
out this face primer as you guys saw and
I have a feeling I'm not going to like
it I can kind of feel but I'm not gonna
like it I don't know which is one of
those products that I feel like it's
going to try to make me more oily than I
actually am not sure if this is going to
be a hit for me so I wouldn't purchase
that unless you really want to because I
don't know if it's going to work so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
let me know eat bought down below in the
comments and I will see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
