gonna be sharing with you my high-end
foundation routine also don't mind if
you can see some lash glue we're drying
right now I have some of the kiss
blowout lashes on just for like a more
wispy and natural look so the lash glue
is drying and then I gotta do a little
bit of a liner in here but that's not
what this videos gonna be on who else is
running on coffee and dry shampoo yeah I
figured I'll show you guys my foundation
routine
I am partnering with Clinique to share
this with you guys you all know I do
love the beyond perfecting foundation
concealer so I'm going to show you guys
how use this a lot of you see me use it
before it's one of my favorite
foundations I've been using a lot of
drugstore foundations recently I've been
really wanting to dip back into my
high-end foundations because I do love
all my high-end foundations and I need
to show them some love I hope you guys
are excited to see this video a lot of
you really liked in my drugstore full
coverage foundation routine and I
figured why not do a high-end one so if
you're not subscribed already be sure to
hit that subscribe button and hit that
notification bell let's just go ahead
and get started ok you guys already know
primer water I get like for my skin to
feel hydrated actually have a Neutrogena
moisturizer on right now it's like their
water gel cream it's really really good
so I have that on I have all my
moisturizers on but I do like to add
just a little bit more with this primer
water I'm gonna go ahead and apply this
next I'm going to use the touches silk
canvas primer this is a filter finished
protective primer I've been liking this
gonna rub it between my fingers and put
this mainly in my problem areas like my
t-zone before I have larger pores and
then I'll also kind of smooth it out to
the outer parts of my face just so those
areas are primed as well this primer
does leave your skin super smooth so now
I'm gonna take the Clinique beyond
perfecting a foundation and concealer so
this is obviously a foundation and
concealer one has a full coverage finish
you can use it underneath your eyes as
concealer this is a really good product
it's been around for a while and there's
reason why because it's a really great
foundation just take it out and it has
this big dohsa applicator feel like
owner what's cleaning the original
people who did this so the shade I'm
using right now is a 9 and neutral this
might be a little too dark for me no
actually that might be okay I was gonna
add Lightner in it if it was that I'm
just gonna go ahead and do some swipes
swipes so like little stripes on my face
this is the best part about this
foundation I mean
this for so long I have a video from a
long time ago when this first came out
and I really liked it so I'll leave that
review down below if you guys would
check it out I was like so long ago back
when I lived in my house so you guys
should go check that out
just gonna use my Real Techniques sponge
to blend this out today this foundation
is great because it covers like all of
my redness it'll cover your under-eye
circles and it just is really so smooth
on the skin it lasts all day and never
looks cakey doesn't emphasize texture I
mean it's just so good it's just one of
those staple foundations ok this color
is like pretty spot-on so this is a
newer color for me then I'm trying out
and this is perfect like beyond perfect
I really did not mean to even like okay
it doesn't sink into your fine lines
anything like that which is why you can
use it as a concealer on your skin
doesn't break me out it really does take
no time to blend this out and get a nice
full coverage finish you guys know me I
love full coverage it can't be without
it they do say that since this
foundation has such high pigment that if
it looks a little too dark when you
first apply it just let it dry and it'll
melt into your skin to give you really
pretty flawless finish also if you guys
don't know a Clinique will offer a
10-day free supply if you visit any
Clinique counter so definitely do that
if you have not tried this foundation go
get you a sample go test it out let them
color match you that's the best part
about it they'll color match you and
then you get a 10 day free sample this
foundation is also allergy tested and
fragrance free so that is the Clinique
of beyond perfecting foundation again
this is in 9 neutral it's like my
perfect color I can't get over this
color it's perfect now what I'm going to
do is conceal when you use two different
concealers I have the Tarte shape tape
and light medium and then I also have
the wise SEL touch concealer I call it
two instead of two o'clock because it's
still a little too fancy for me first
thing I'm gonna do is take the Tarte
shape tape and I'm gonna go underneath
my eyes you guys know I've been loving
the flower Beauty concealer too but this
is all high-end here I've recently tried
out the milk makeup full coverage
concealer and so far I like that I'm
still trying it out to give you guys a
full review but it is not a bad product
though with the tarte shaped tape I put
it like underneath my eyes where I have
the most darkness inside the inner
corner of my eye
I get super dark in there then I'm gonna
take the Y's cell touch concealer this
one's in 3.5 and then I'll just
highlight my face with the rest of this
I like actually hate the clicky pins but
this is such a nice concealer that I'm
okay with it then I'm gonna take my Real
Techniques sponge and we're just gonna
blend that out the sponge is so good I
don't know why but mine's like tearing
apart do I use it too much
why I sell concealer really just adds a
little bit of radiance and like a more
hydrated look to the Tarte shape tape I
really love this combo I'm still
obsessed with a heart-shaped tape
concealer even though there's other
concealers that I really like as well
that are high-end this one's just a you
know it's just a must-have those that if
you're ever just feeling like concealers
aren't doing the job heart-shaped tape
comes in and saves the day so I just
went ahead and blended everything out
really nice and seamless and then for
the inner corners I am gonna take a
smaller brush this one's the it
cosmetics blurring concealer it's like a
tiny little fluffy brush and what I do
is I like to go in here and just kind of
do circular motions and then I'll take
any excess onto my lid to even that out
as well but I really focus it here just
to make sure that area is nice and
bright and makes you look so much more
awake now if I was gonna do like a full
glam on my eyes I would not put this
concealer on my eyelids but I'm just
gonna add some bronzer in here okay so
what I like to do is just take my Beauty
Blender after I've blended everything
out I go over one last time just to make
sure I got all that product pushed in
and I kind of take it all over my face
start underneath my eyes and I'll just
push all the way down beside my face so
if there's any harsh lines from like the
concealer to the foundation I just
really try to work with it and that way
I know everything is completely pressed
in and sunk into the skin and there's
not going to be any crazy like
foundation concealer lines that didn't
mix we are so nice and bright we have a
little bit of a glow to our skin we are
full coverage and now we're gonna set
everything and I think you guys know
what powder I'm going to use that's
high-end because this one is so good it
is the Too Faced peach perfect
mattifying powder this is what it looks
like it is one of those powders that if
you just feel like you're found
looks a little witch this one doesn't so
it's gonna make this whole look like
even better but if you think your
foundation is just looking a little like
wonky you could put this powder on and
it literally just transforms it into
like this smooth canvas it is amazing
what I've been doing recently is just
using a Beauty Blender to apply powder
all over I'll start underneath my eyes
and apply like the most powder there for
me I don't find that this kids cakey
underneath my eyes or anything so I feel
like I can do that so I'll apply the
most under here and I'll go over the
rest of my face in my Beauty Blender and
just press that powder into my skin not
like this but so I rip my sifter off
this smells so good you guys I can't get
over it so I'm gonna take that much and
I'm gonna start underneath my eye
getting right up to that lower lash line
I'm really pressing it in and then I'll
just go down the side of my face to set
the rest of the makeup to me I just feel
like it looks really even I've been
really enjoying using a sponge to apply
my powder because I don't find that it
gets super cakey or anything like that
it really just presses it into that skin
and then with your body heat I feel like
it just melts in and it looks so good
that's just my preference I haven't
really been using a brush to too much to
apply powder unless I just need a quick
Hey unless I just need a quick
application look at how smooth that
we're looking it is so crazy and then
I'll start pressing on my nose take the
rest onto my forehead real quick I
recently went back to this bronzer and
oh my gosh I used it in a video that I
just filmed yesterday and I used to use
this bronzer all the time but I just
went back to it and I've been using this
darker shade I was always using bronze
Oh too but now I'm using bronze o3 this
is the Laura Mercier macked radiance
baked powder and this gives you such a
gorgeous bronzed look and it looks so
natural it's so smooth so I'm gonna take
my little dome brush here it's from
Sonia kasha and I'm just going to bronze
my face like I normally do I'm telling
you this is the smoothest powder ever
and I cannot believe I just let this sit
in my drawer and forgot about it for so
long it's so pretty
and it's that perfect bronzer where it's
nice and warm there's no shimmer it
really just looks so beautiful so now
it's time to contort my knees one of my
staple bronzers for this it's one that I
always go back to if I just don't know
what to use if I just want to use
something that I've always loved and
this is a bronzer I have used for years
like the longest time and it is the
benefit hoola bronzer it says Kasey's
hoola because we got this so long ago
where they like customized it for a PR
package I really love this bronzer so
much for me it's just like that perfect
tone it's kind of ashy it's perfect to
contour my nose with so this is what I'm
gonna contour with today so using the
morphe m5 1:02 contour it's just nice
and fluffy and gets right in there you
see is just like that perfect shade it
looks so light in the pan but then you
put it on your face and you're like oh
so I'm just gonna contour underneath my
cheekbones I'm doing little circular
motions also taking it back to my ear
that way we don't have any like spaces
in between right here you guys already
know this next one but to highlight I'm
gonna be using the Anasazi glow kit and
sugar by far one of my favorite
highlight palettes shoots ever come out
with my two favorites is marshmallow and
starburst I mix these two all the time I
normally just take this one
farther down my cheek I'm gonna apply
starburst first with my arm Stassi at 83
brush and I like to start mid cheek and
work my way kind of down just very
lightly so I bring the highlight pretty
far forward and then I also kind of just
do a little circular up there so the
highlight kind of goes up towards that
brow just same over here I'm very
lightly applying this as well I'm using
my finger to take that highlight just
down the center of my nose I don't bring
it like all the way to the tip unless
it's by accident so this is a lark blush
and technicolor this is like a staple
from me I don't know if you guys
remember I used to talk about this all
the time it's such a good blush so I'm
just gonna use this little brush I
cannot find my blush brush anywhere from
Sigma and this brush is always picks up
too much product cuz it's a foundation
brush I normally like to pliable
on the apples of my cheeks but since I
have highlighter already down there I'm
just gonna skip that but I am gonna go
in and blend these together and just
kind of melt them all and when I use the
stippling brush I am so light handed
with it but I am doing a lot of circular
motion so I'm not really moving my
makeup a lot I'm just buffing that out
but with such a light hand where the
bristles are barely like raising your
face if you go in and you're like super
harsh with it it is gonna move your
makeup but you just gotta gotta be
gentle just have a nice light hand and
do circular motions especially right
here at the cheeks if I need to blend
out my highlight my cheeks I'll just go
in here and I'll do circular motions
going backwards after I blend everything
out I'm going to go back in with
marshmallow and I'm gonna put this right
in the center of the cheek just for that
pop and then that is pretty much it you
guys so I'm gonna go ahead and fill my
brows and I'm also going to put a lip
product on and then I'll be right back
to close this video out for you guys so
I finish up my brows and this is the
final look I hope you guys enjoyed it
just look so pretty
and smooth I love it I am wearing my
pull audio collab in Georgia it's this
color that I'm wearing right now they
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
this foundation routine
you look super glam whether you're
wearing just lashes or a full blown
eyeshadow look so hope you guys enjoyed
it thank you again so much for watching
and I will see you all in my next video
