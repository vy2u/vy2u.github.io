you know I don't know if we need this
the fan is all the way over here you're
fine you can go higher I swear if this
is too low you are too low I almost fell
backwards hey guys welcome back so today
I have my husband here
Davis even down here it's a head of a
multi husband I haven't called you
husband on my channel Davis is here and
I told him to go through my makeup
collection and pick out the makeup I
should wear for today we're traveling to
Montreal today and then we're gonna have
like a little date night and whatnot so
we have a long day ahead of us and he
picked out some products nice we're
gonna see how well these last throughout
the day you guys know I kind of like
have a set routine of how I like to do
certain things and there's a few things
missing but for the most part I think
we'll have a good face as he was going
through the drawers that you guys will
see in just a moment I was like oh I
hope he picks that and then you like
let's swap it out I was hoping to pick
the morphe palette for eyeshadow but he
picked this one that I haven't tried yet
it smells good no this is not the
high-end one this one's me yeah that was
the high-end one this is the drugstore
one they just copied their logo yeah I'm
gonna be doing the full face of the
products that he picked out today and
we'll see how wears will do like a where
tests will kind of do like vlog style at
the end of this video since we're all
gonna be here we'll kind of close it out
in Montreal which is really cool yeah
what kind of look should I go for
something smoke think we decided on the
casual date night in Montreal look so
that's why I picked a pinkish so I'm
going to show you guys the clip of Davis
picking everything out and going through
the drawers and then I will come back
and I will put all the makeup on and get
his opinion and then wear it throughout
the day
sounds good all right you're not
subscribed already be sure to hit that
subscribe button before you leave and if
you want to see Davis pick out all my
makeup and see how it wears the other
day then
let's just go ahead and get started
people hate this nothing I love it all
right make sure you don't hit anything
okay don't worry about the fame you
could even lift up okay so Davis is
going to pick out my makeup for the day
he can pick from any of these drawers
all of these right here you don't really
need those but this okay I noticing it's
either high end right will you stop I
know I already got a primer but I'm
still looking
what's that Smashbox primer Iser
you just need to go after that one
you're not gonna go into this drawer
right here products I don't like no I'm
not using anything out that door you
have to write listen you have to use
anything I think it should be somewhat
easy and I'll tell you why after you get
done concealer do you need to put your
glasses
jeez I'll even throw in some dry shampoo
for you all right
thanks honey that's it the reason I was
cracking up about you not finding stuff
is it it's in order so you have your
primers obviously foundations go into
concealers set it with the powder then
you go into bronzers then you go into
the blushes that's cheatin Goes Down
Goes Down Goes Down yeah you should have
told me that cuz I don't know but then
like over here it would I let you go in
here because a lot of this stuff I
haven't tried so I could have done a
first impressions maybe we could do a
video first impressions of stuff you've
picked out well let me get one return
why are you returning it because I'm
returning the blush and the bronzer for
this thing that says bronze and blush so
Davis pulled quite a few items we have
some high-end we have some drugstore I'm
really glad we didn't do the Sephora one
again where he went and bought so much
worth of makeup that was an expensive
video okay that was a cousin but we've
got some good stuff here he obviously
knows what I like to just kind of get
through this video pretty quickly and
then let you guys know as I go through
if there's something I do like don't
like this is gonna be kind of like a get
ready with me style so I'll just put
everything on my face that you know how
it goes he did get a primer for eyes I
was nervous about I didn't know for sure
if he was gonna remember this he also
pulled the makeup revolution golden bar
eyeshadow palette which I have not tried
yet he also pulled the Natasha Genoa
foundation X Smashbox primer water
Maybelline better skin concealer the Too
Faced Born This Way powder or bronzer we
have the Park Avenue princess palette
from Tarte that you pulled which I love
this palette I think it's awesome oh
yeah he also pulled this which is the
Charlotte Tilbury film-star bronze and
blush glow and I'm excited about this
this is like a new shade I believe
that is in PR its new haven't used it
yet we have the Smashbox Pearl highlight
with me in my cloud with Smashbox and
then we have an eyeliner here he just
pulled a pencil liner
this was the OnPoint eyeliner by pure
and then he also pulled this pure fully
charged mascara which I've never tried
says it's a casual date night but he
pulls like one of the most dramatic
lashes this is the kiss lash Couture
Fifth Avenue collection they look really
pretty but they're not casual and forget
brows we have the Tarte Amazonian clay
waterproof brow mousse and taupe which I
haven't used and forever so I'm excited
to test it out again and then the Jade
cat beauty lip finiti I'm gonna go ahead
get started we got fresh hair for our
skin I'm ready to get it going
they
that we've done
enough for me
stubby
not for me
it's a feeling
don't let me okay look listen do you
like it yeah I probably would have
picked a different lip you see or lip
liner I miss the eyelashes I need a
liquid liner for the lashes so I could
like connect them like with my lash but
yeah the pencil liner isn't working for
me
you look good either you like the smoky
bronze kind of thing yeah I'm gonna wear
it throughout the day I have to say that
this palette was nice the shimmer shades
some of them were kind of like duds but
this one applied with the finger was
really nice this one was really good to
use like in the crease and the outer V
and this is a really nice highlight so
it is all shimmers that's why I use like
the bronzers and stuff for my transition
shades and things like that but other
than that turned out pretty well I would
probably have requested a liquid liner
and the lip liner that's okay anyways we
will catch you guys in a little blog
update in a little bit so we just made
it into Canada I feel like the makeup is
still going as strong but what do you
think
it looks good but I think it's going
strong which man into Canada days he's
excited Daisy are you excited with
rallies oh is is me it's only been like
a couple hours two hours at the most
so since I've had this makeup on head of
it now and I will keep you guys updated
all right so we're off to our first
adventure and believe it or not Casey
chose the louis vuitton stole is wearing
off of my nose yeah does that make it
wearing off doesn't look too great right
now guys I just want to document the
case he got complimented on her makeup
and guess we picked it out that guy
well she liked it and
you know so we're trying to find some
other stores and then we're gonna go
have dinner with our friend okay see
just got Montreal purchase number Tina
we made a stop from shopping got a few
drinks
it's not a drink unless you snapchat it
she'd rather walk in the snow than walk
on the pavement this one not so much
okay so and this is what the makeup
looks like it's around like 1:30 in the
morning
I chose Sudan actually pretty well and
the lashes stayed on is it really
dramatic this foundation is not doing so
high you can kind of see where like
rubbed off my chin watch over here it's
looking super heavy in here it looks
okay but like really up close to the
mirror I think the foundation is just
like not working I think I need a
different primer for it maybe I don't
know I don't think this color really is
starting it off I mean maybe a little
bit but I think it's just not sitting
well oh no I wasn't too bad I think I
was like what ten hours aware but I got
done it like twelve anyways I'm gonna
wrap it up for this video I hope you
guys enjoyed it it's time to wash it off
and let me know what you guys thought in
the comments below and we will see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
