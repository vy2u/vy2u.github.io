on my new favorite foundation and it is
the makeup for ever matte velvet plus
now I'm obsessed with this foundation
like it's probably the best foundation
I've come across in a very long time
don't get me wrong I still love my
Revlon Colorstay like I said in previous
videos there's just a huge difference
between drugstore and high-end
foundations so I really love these I
think they're about thirty-six dollars a
pop I really can't remember I think it
is 36 though but I got two because they
do self-tan so my color like my skin
kind of fluctuate and the color side I'm
in are 40 and a 35 now if you had this
foundation and you forget what color you
have I know a bunch of people have a
hard time figuring it out on the bottle
and it's actually on the bottom in your
reference number so I'll show you right
now so if you look up here this is the
top line this ends reference for re F
whatever and it has a number and then
the very last two digits on there
this one says number 40 so this
foundation is the number 40 foundation
and like my other one will have its own
little reference numbers and then I will
have 35 at the end so if you guys don't
know I had very oily skin and it's a
really difficult kind of situation I
know people with dry skin do have their
own difficulties but for my only skin
girls you know what I'm talking about
it's very difficult you look like a
greaseball if you're not careful and
it's just really hard now I have one tip
if you do have very Lillie skin and
you're just getting two foundations you
know stay away from things that are
gonna be moisturizing things that say
you know you're gonna have like
luminosity to your skin things like that
you really want to stay away from
because you don't really want that extra
moisture in your skin because you're
gonna get really shiny and really greasy
very easily so I honestly have only pros
to say about this foundation I have no
cons at all I've literally been wearing
this pretty much every single day
because
my self tanner you know I want to match
my face to my neck this does not break
me out at all which is a huge blessing
I'm so excited that this does not break
me out because a lot of foundations my
skin I think is really sensitive too so
they just break me out like crazy but
this I can use every day and not have a
problem also I do asset to my foundation
I set mine with this makeup forever
super matte loose powder now you want to
talk about having a matte face all day
this and this combined you're gonna be
matte all day long now you will kind of
have to touch up your t-zone because
that's just normal but I mean I stay
matte all day and if I touch up
throughout the day it's the Maybelline
Dream matte powder which is a really
nice light powder so kind of keeping
your purse and when you're on the go the
way I apply these foundations is with a
brush and I've mentioned this so many
times as well this is a sigma flat
angled kabuki f88 has a really nice
sharp edge and it gets right underneath
my eyes so perfectly and I love it so
much now this is a very long wearing
foundation for me personally I can wear
this for a long period of time and it
will not wear off and I'll still look
just as flawless in the night time as it
does when I first put it on it's not
super heavy this is such a comfortable
foundation like my skin can breathe and
it doesn't feel like a have foundation
on my face at all this also gives you
more of the airbrushed kind of finish
you know it doesn't really take up or
anything like that I have not had any of
those problems with this foundation and
a lot of you if you've been watching my
videos when I don't wear makeup in the
beginning or if I don't wanna make it
throughout my video I have really really
really red cheeks and just redness on my
face it's just natural it's just what I
have this covers it up so so well I
don't have a lot of acne I don't have
that problem my problem is just more
redness but this covers that up so nice
so more than likely if you have acne I
think you can still really use this
I really recommend these two products
I'll put a link down below just Sephora
where you can get these directly because
I forget how much this one is yeah I
can't remember but they are both so
amazing and I love them a lot of you
have been asking for a new foundation
routine with the
and I've kind of been on the fence about
it because I've done so many face
routines in the past couple months that
I didn't want to do another one because
I didn't know how you guys would feel
about it I just don't want to put out so
many face routines and that basically be
all of my videos you know what I mean so
but if you really really want a new face
routine with this then just like the
video and leave a comment down below or
something letting me know because that's
the only thing I've been thinking about
I didn't want to do one unless you guys
really really really wanted it so just
like the video or let me know down below
in the comments and I'll be happy to do
one for you guys and I will see you guys
in my next video
