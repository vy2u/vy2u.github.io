I got
hey guys so today I have a nighttime
routine for you and this day I was
actually logging and painting my front
door I painted it white to black and
this was a huge project but it took me a
couple times to get it right but I
absolutely loved it and this is just
what I did today and I danced around and
just had a good time and I also did like
I said vlog the day so if you want to
check out my blog channel you can click
anywhere on the screen now and it'll
take you right to it so once I got back
home I greeted my puppies as I always do
and then I have to shut my blinds
because I do open them every day so I go
through and I just shut all my blinds
when night falls coming because I don't
want people looking inside my house then
it's time to go upstairs and get
comfortable so I just like to go in my
bedroom and pick out anything that's
comfy I usually go for sweats and a
sweatshirt or just a regular top I keep
my house pretty chilly so I usually
always have slides on after I've taken
my hair down it's time to go downstairs
and make some food because I'm always
hungry and tonight I just made a
healthier version of a burrito and I
just took basic ingredients like chicken
I'd already made some cheese sour cream
I'm very very simple when it comes to my
burritos I don't need a lot of stuff I
just like it nice and simple
after that then I'm going to go into the
living room and turn on my TV and cable
and I'm always watching Bravo no matter
what and then I usually catch up on
vlogging at this time and just all of my
shows right now I'm loving all the Real
Housewives million dollar listing and
southern charm was my jam but sadly they
had their final episode so now I'm just
waiting for the reunion so then I just
like to play with my puppies get on my
iPad and just chill out for a little bit
before I go upstairs to take off my
makeup once it go upstairs it's kind of
like one of those things where I'm super
tired and I'm like do I really want to
wash my face and I'm like okay you have
to wash your face so I'm gonna put my
hair up in a bun the first thing I like
to take is this Clinique take off the
day balm the stuff is amazing at taking
off your makeup just don't get it in
your eyes because it hurts so bad just
don't get it in your eyes and you'll be
fine but it takes off everything after
that I like to go in with my purity
cleanser from philosophy and I like to
just give my face a good wash another
time just to make sure I get everything
off and then what I'll do is I will just
pat dry my face and then I'll move on to
moisturizers
and if you're wondering what I used
today I will have a list listed in the
description box below so you can check
them out these products are great for
oily skin and sensitive skin and they've
just been what I've been using a lot
lately then it's time to of course brush
my teeth
this one isn't my favorite but I do like
the Colgate I think it's like three day
advanced white toothpaste oh my gosh
it's amazing and then I have to floss my
teeth of course so I'm just going to go
ahead and do that and I actually really
enjoy flossing after I've done my
mouthwash it's time to go ahead and take
my hair down and get ready for bed and
taking my hair down has to be one of the
best parts of the night so once I go
into my bedroom I like to put my phone
on the charger and then I will spray
this sleep spray I forget what it's
called but it's from Bath and Body Works
and it's supposed to make you sleep
better and all these other stuff but
honestly it just smells really good and
I just I don't know I like the way it
smells and then I go into my alarm
settings and I have a ton of alarms I
don't know why but I always do I set
like ten in a row sometimes so I like to
set my alarm for 8:30 9 o'clock to wake
up and then I'm just gonna go to bed
