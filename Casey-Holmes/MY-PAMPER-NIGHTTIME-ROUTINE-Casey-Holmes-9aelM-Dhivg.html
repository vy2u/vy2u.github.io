showing the deep my pamper and nighttime
routine and I'm super excited to show it
to you because I have some new products
in here that I've been using that I love
and that are perfect for a like spa
night at home so the first thing I'm
going to do is put my hair up in a messy
bun and I'm going to tie that down and
then take off all of my jewelry so I've
must be know I've mentioned this in like
a past text video but I have really dry
feet so during these pamper night time
routines I don't get a pedicure very
often I get one about once every two to
three weeks so what I like to use to
keep the softness of my feet is this mo
pay pedi perfect wet and dry
rechargeable foot file it's a long name
but basically it's great for if you have
really dry skin on the bottom of your
feet I get it at the top of my foot
around my big toe and my heel this is
the perfect product to use if you want
to extend your salon pedicure and not
have to go in to get them to scrub your
feet and also you can use this wet or
dry I'm using it dry right now so I
could show you guys how I use it but you
can also take it in the shower with you
this is not something you do every
single night so just be warned of that
something you do once in a while so I
love this to get all that dead skin off
and make my skin nice and smooth I
really recommend it if you have dry feet
like myself because I don't lotion my
feet everyday and then what I like to do
is take off my makeup I'm using the
Clinique to take off the day cleansing
balm and what this does is it breaks
down all of my makeup so I can go ahead
and wash it so I like to rinse that off
and then I'll go in with my purity from
philosophy and this will just help get
everything off my face and get ready for
the awesome face mask I'm going to use
so after I Pat my face dry I'm going in
with this mask it's from Al jenis and I
forget what it's called I can't see
right now because I'm moving it too much
but this is a cool mask I really do like
it if you have problems with pores
breaking out anything like that this is
a great mask to try and it dries really
quickly but I will say the smell is not
that great just FYI but it is a great
mask to use so I like to go ahead and
put that on and then I will pick out the
lush items that I want to use for my
back so these are just lush items in
there for Christmas and I'm like I
should probably use these up so I pick a
few to put in my best so I could kind of
use them but I love lush products when I
have the time I love to take a bath and
really pamper myself in this kind of
nighttime routine and I don't like to
fill my tub up all the way I know some
people do but I kind of find it just
like a waste so I'll fill it up not even
halfway and then I'll put in my lush
products and this is the time I just
hang out sometimes I just stay off my
phone and play with my dogs my dogs love
the lush products like they're so
fascinated by it so I'll usually like
pull them out of the water and like let
them sniff the water or whatever and I
just love it this bath was so good by
the way it was super moisturizing and
great for my feet since I just
exfoliated them and it was just so good
my skin felt so freakin soft I loved it
then after that I'm going to go ahead
and take off the mask and this massive
kind of scary to take off because it
kind of looks like blood when you take
it off but it comes off and your skin
looks good and that's all that matters
so then I'm going to do my night time
skincare routine this is for when I want
some extra moisture so I'm going to use
this al Genest
eye cream and I like to use this one
because it's really moisturizing and
it's just great I'm almost out of it I
mean using it for so long so I'm going
to tap that underneath my eyes and then
I'm going to go in with my benefit
moisturizer which is super moisturizing
and I'm going to put this all over at my
skin as well
so after I take my hair down I'm going
to show you guys the next thing I do
which is new and I like to use this oil
diffuser and I'm using this good-night
oil it's just like a calming oil to help
you sleep better and I got my diffuser
at Walgreens I don't really know the
difference between them but I like mine
and I smell it and it smells good so
that's what I'm using and it lights up
really pretty so after that I'm going to
just chill in bed and get on my phone
and this is also the time where I do
like to apply moisturizer I'll show you
guys the one I like to use but it's
super moisturizing it's from lush I love
it if you have super dry skin you need
it in your life and then I just hang out
with the dogs I laugh at them because
Rose always covers her face with the
curtains Daisy's like I need some camera
time so she gets her camera time and
then I finally put on my lotion I'm
telling you this stuff is the bomb I
just got it but honestly I cannot stop
using it it's so amazing and then after
that it is time to go to bed and my pimp
at nighttime routine is done it's really
simple but effective and it makes me
feel super refreshed and ready to go to
sleep and start the next day so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and I will see you all in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
