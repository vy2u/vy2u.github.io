time now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
play with my dogs he did we Ruiz mommy
say mommy cleans the floors and then we
messed up doing you oh my sweet girl

okay now I'm going to show you guys my
overnight boats recipe so what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna take a cup you can use
whatever cup you want to you need
blueberries and then you're gonna need
some protein as well no way no way I had
those where do they go well I guess this
will be for a different day because so
I'm really sad right now
I guess I'm very good the grocery store
tomorrow get some oats because you need
outs for overnight oats this is a
real-life nighttime routine I would be
sitting here wondering why I have no
oats
where did they go I had a whole thing
oat save this for a vlog so be sure you
subscribe to my vlog Channel and I'll
show you having my open is good you're
gonna want to know they're gonna be good
I am so excited to all this makeup
because I turned out some new products
today like a new foundation and it just
feels a little you don't have e on my
skin but it actually doesn't look that
bad right now I mean I look really oily
but it doesn't look that bad right now
so I'm going to go ahead and take off my
makeup with you guys and show you what
my nighttime is skincare routine I'm
really excited too because Clinique
wanted to partner up before at this part
of the video which I am so excited about
because I've been using the very first
product of my nighttime routine from
them for I dunno how long like literally
forever
very excited they wanted to partner
together and it's for me to showcase it
because it's actually still out right
here in my travel bag because I have not
unpacked most of my travel bag it's
actually still in here's first step to
my skincare routine is definitely the
clinic take off the day at cleansing
balm I love this stuff that you can
obviously tell it really does take off
absolutely everything goes from a balm
and really melts into this really nice
oil that melts everything away and then
you rinse it all off first thing I'm
gonna do is take my hair on this
ponytail and put it into a high pony
like a high pony bun a high pony bun so
I'm gonna go ahead and take off my rings
lashes are off one of the best feelings
second best feeling taking off the rest
your makeup so I like to take a good
scoop one half will glam like this I
take a good amount you really don't need
that much because a little it does go a
long way but I just love the way that
this feel so you just rub it in between
your fingers and it kind of starts to
melt down and do this oil and when I
first use this years ago I thought since
it went into oil that it would break me
out because I'm Whaley but not at all
this is probably like one of the only
cleanse off products that doesn't
completely break out my skin or irritate
my rosacea I have very sensitive skin
and this just works so well for me and
it just takes everything off I look
beautiful they work it around my
hairline and my lips as well doesn't
burn my eyes at all either you guys
doesn't burn anything and it doesn't
take much effort to get everything kind
of melted down so now I'm gonna get my
water warm rinse it off and then I'll
cleanse my skin and we'll come back and
we want to do what the rest I'll let you
guys know while this water is getting
warm that in July Clinique is doing a
promotion where if you buy a cleanser
like a Clinique cleanser or makeup
remover you can get deluxe sample to
take off the day makeup remover and a
facial soap so you get two deluxe
samples if you buy a makeup room
I love this onesie my ultimate favorite
just because I can do my eyes in my
entire face that you know whatever you
look try it feels so good when I rinse
that off it's just like amazing now I'm
just gonna take my cleanser and cleanse
my skin one last time to make sure all
the makeups remove so again I always
have make them around my hairline so try
to get there and you're ready sit off
then I just like to Pat my face dry so
that is my cleansing routine lip it
doesn't irritate my skin at all if it
did my redness would be super intense
right now also I'm gonna mention real
quick I did use the origins checks and
balances this is the frothy face washes
buddy used after I use that balm and
rinse it off I wanna try this out it's
these thickness getting care brush set
and there's just a bunch of different
ones this is just a silicone a little
super right here and I wanna do a mask
tonight because I started my cycle and
I'm kind of breaking out here and here
which is really normal and just like
hormonal breakouts this is the purity of
pore extractor
it's an exfoliating clay mask and this
is really gonna pull everything out of
your skin I'm telling you this gives me
a really intense glow so helps my
breakouts and tightening my pores and I
really feel like my skincare sinks in
after I use this product so I've been
really enjoying it I think it's a great
product it only takes like five to ten
minutes for it to harden and it gets
super super hard for real throw I'm
gonna take some on this spatula which is
kind of nice I don't have to get my
fingers wet this is really satisfying
there's something about this that is
just so satisfying I really focus this
at my nose and just these problem areas
another thing to let me know if you guys
have this issue but when I try to use
lip balms I break out around my mouth I
don't know why it's like no matter what
lip balm it could be chapstick it could
be anything I break out around my lips
like literally the lines in my lip let
me know if that happens to anybody else
because it's really frustrating because
I want to use like a nice lip balm for
my lips like at night but then I just
don't think it's worth having breakouts
in the morning you know what I mean my
lips really don't get chapped the only
time they ever get like chapped at all
is if they get sunburned which is really
rare like even in the winter time I
don't use chapstick and they don't
really get that chapped
so actually I don't know why I use this
thing because you're supposed to really
rub this into your skin so I'm about to
have to use my fingers because with this
mask when you put it on you like should
put it on in circular motions like this
and it really gets deep into the pores
so that was nice for well a lesson I
really feel like this helps too because
it's a little bit gritty and I really do
believe that it gets deep into those
pores and exfoliates and this will start
to harden like immediately so just FYI
we're gonna put up some laundry that's
what we're gonna do how my life goes
that's adulting for you
laundry isn't ever done I've ever done
I'm also going to check out my video and
make sure everything is Wow I'm also
gonna check out my video make sure
everything is going smooth on that side
of things
everything's going pretty smooth for
that okay now we can put away clothes
that I tried on today but didn't put
away because so these are the clothes I
got to put up really nothing crazy this
is not what you're thinking it's a
tripod okay what if I could stick you
guys to TV it's not a bad idea
do I get any music because you guys
aren't listening to music and I feel
like I need music too
I know my pajamas are really attractive
I'm just like a t-shirt dress type of
person when I go to bed I hate pants I
hate shorts I hate anything that feels
like constricting so I usually go for
t-shirts like this I'll just buy them
from language or a secret or Nordstrom
now we're gonna do the rest of the
skincare I've done I've washed my face
brush my teeth all of that stuff and I'm
just gonna show you guys the rest of my
skincare for the night time so first
thing is I've been incorporating this
this is the Itachi the essence there's
another essence that I was trying so I'm
just going back and forth with both I
mean I'm just trying to see if I see a
difference with essence first off but I
put it in my hand I rub it and then I
just kind of press it into my skin a lot
of you told me to do this after I shared
that my last essence was like going down
so quickly like I was using a lot of it
up and you were like um don't use a
cotton pad with it save so product and I
was like okay I'm down for that
you guys know I love my love seat on
body butter but I've also been trying
this nut and it's really good too it's
the Tata indigo soothing silk body
butter if I add this in the mornings but
if I don't I will apply it at night or
if I'm just feeling very dehydrated like
if my skin just feels really dry I'll
apply this and it smells so good it
smells like the silk canvas primer so
it's put on the serum I'm going to use
this drone
elephant glycolic serum this product
helps so much with breakouts and texture
and I've been using it for so long now I
just really really love it I love drunk
elephant so much for I became you I'm
going to use the belief most rising I
bone love this stuff a little bit goes a
long way with this product while the
lining in this is just really making me
look fantastic
another thing I'll usually do at night
time which I don't need to do it now
because I'm pretty soft and actually did
it last night but all self tan at this
time always do it before bed I never do
it during the day so there's two
products I've been using recently one
that I have been using constantly is
this are no laws Lowe hydrotherapy
memory sleep mask this is very very
hydrating only you guys can really see
it it's like a light pink and it feels
so good I've used quite a bit of this
product and I really love it it smells
good it feels good on the skin and you
can feel it too the next morning like
it's amazing I love this stuff I've also
been trying this out so I'm going to
feature it in this video it's the Itachi
soothing a triple recovery cream they
sent me like a care package of a bunch
of stuff so just been trying it out and
I'm going to use this all over my face
as well and that's honestly all I do for
skincare I don't do too much other than
that a mask
I don't do every single night sometimes
I'll do like sheet masks something
that's hydrating or something that's
brightening but that's pretty much it
for serum moisturizer eye cream and then
I incorporated the essence to one other
thing I'll do for my neck and chest is
this lemare lifting and firming mask I
can't recommend this a hundred percent
and I mean if you already moisturize you
know you don't really need this stuff
you could just add more moisturizer but
I still have some of this left so I'm
just gonna apply this to my neck and
chest it smells so good but I just can't
I can't say like oh my gosh I see the
biggest difference ever
self-tanner I used last night was this
st. marys instant self-tanning mist and
dark is pretty good I have so many
self-tanner these are literally all the
self tanners I have been trying out like
super I'm trying to find the absolute
best I'm reviewing them for you guys
I know you really want to see this so
stay tuned
I'm trying them all out for you I can't
tell you how many I tried very last step
to my routine is brushing my hair
because they do have extensions so I do
like to brush it before I head to bed so
I'll just take any wet brush I have
these lying around everywhere and I'll
brush through and then I'll show you
guys what I do when I wash my hair in a
morning routine which I could probably
film at tomorrow because I need to wash
my hair I wanted to do it tonight but
it's just too late now
it takes like an hour to hour and 15
minutes to wash and blow-dry this hair
honestly I'm just trying to get a bit
just run this all the way through
sometimes I'll put it in a braid
sometimes I won't
tonight I'm not gonna put it in a braid
my skin is refreshed and ready to go so
we're gonna we have to sleep with the
fan on
so of course and I always have to have a
water and then somebody's usually on my
side of the bed when they come to bed
man you can sleep here but you just
gotta go to the other side it's okay
excuse me yes this is my side we know
this I've been sleeping on this side for
years say she uses the pillows but as
you wanna come up here she always sleeps
in the closet but sometimes sometimes
she'll come up here so that's it when
daddy's here normally daddies with us
but just the three of us right girls the
night I need a high five for good night
I'll take a kiss I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and enjoyed seeing like my
nighttime skincare routine and just how
I get ready for bed I'm sorry that my
overnight oats was a fail yep you're on
