all about my favorite outfits and
hairstyles that I wore to New York
Fashion Week thank you so much Tresemme
for partnering me with this video and
for also sending me out to New York it
was so much fun so let's just get
started
hey guys and so at today's video I'm
going to share with you three of my
favorite outfits and hair styles of that
I wore to New York Fashion Week and I'm
sorry to hear sirens and everything
welcome to New York great let me share
this with you guys because I had like
three top outfits that I really liked
now when I do stuff like this like get
ready for New York Fashion Week well
actually this is the first time but when
I got ready this time I didn't really
want to go like too much like all out I
wanted to wear something I felt
comfortable in and something I felt like
was kinda stylish to my guy would kind
of London I can't wait to share them
with you
I had videos of two of the outfits and
the hair but I only have one picture of
one of my favorites because I forgot to
film it and it was like one of my
absolute favorites so the birds outfit
that I wore them obsessed with and
absolutely loved was the frill sleeves
like with the lace-up and the Cape oh my
gosh I love that it was so simple I just
had some plain black booties on and some
dark denim little white kind of business
chic in a way I really love jazz I was
so beautiful and I loved my hair at
first I had it straight but then I went
to the Tresemme salon and they put some
waves in it and it was really gorgeous
and wavy we all know I love Wayne they
did a really great job at the salon just
given me some classic curl so that was
my first favorite outfit my second one
is actually the top I'm wearing here I
just love the cutout of details and the
lines is Valentine's Day so I love the
red so this also has some spikes on them
they have bed bonds well it kind of tied
in with the shirt then I had faux
leather jacket over top and I just loved
the outfit and my hair today feels like
I kind of want like a messy updo but not
too formal and this is perfect
it was amazing to use such great
products I had to wash my hair today so
she had to put some of the Tresemme sea
salt spray and if you also put some any
Tresemme extra hold hairspray and let me
tell you guys it has been so windy here
in New York my hair like whenever the
next outfit I had braids I had back
in this this last you through the wind I
am so shocked at that hairspray I held
it in place this is one my favorite
outfit in hair combos I just loved it
especially with this top kinda is more
of a high neck and then taking the hair
all the way off so you can receive the
details of the top and then my last
favorite outfit was so casual it was
this t-shirt dress with the buttons
going down and I had some over the knee
boots and then just a black coat draped
over my shoulders so it was really
really cold this day but I survived
somehow my coat was amazing I recommend
like super long coats if you're going to
wear like a dress during this time of
year when it's really cold love that and
then for my hair I again kind of went to
go with the casual theme because it
wasn't too dressy so we just did those
two added braids which I will show you
those clips as well in this video and I
loved it and I photographer about some
amazing photos of the hair I mean I just
love it with my hair color too because I
have like some blonde and I have some
Brown and you can really see the detail
of the braid to braid my hair down with
some hairspray to use because that day
was like a wind storm that future dress
really does wrinkle so quickly so I
would highly recommend it to you guys I
would just recommend a t-shirt dress
that does not wrinkle as quickly because
I think it's still super cute but the
wrinkles were kind of annoying those are
my top 3 hair and outfit choices I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
I had so much fun here this is like my
recap of this past week I've been here
for a while my view is so amazing I
probably subscribe in the beginning but
of course you can see Freedom Tower
right there in the Sun is setting it has
just been such an awesome trip and I
loved going behind the scenes and like
seeing backstage and then like looking
at all the clothes the hair test is so
cool it was such a great experience and
kind of said it's over but I hope you
all enjoyed this video and enjoy seeing
some of my favorite outfits and
hairstyles and I will see you guys back
in Georgia bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
