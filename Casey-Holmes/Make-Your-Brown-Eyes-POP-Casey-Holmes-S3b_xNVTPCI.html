all about this makeup look and it is
mainly for my girls with brown eyes now
any eye color can try this out but this
is specifically for the brown eyed girls
that once you really enhance their brown
eyes I feel like I love brown eyes I'm a
little biased because I have brown eyes
but I really love brown eyes I think
they're really sultry really sexy I mean
any eye color is sexy do not get me
wrong I love every eye color but I just
really love brown eyes and I think some
people like dog they're brown eyes
because they're really deep and dark and
they're not special I guess like with
blue eyes it's really different and
there's like icy blues and things like
that but brown eyes are just as
beautiful as all the other eye colors so
do not hate your brown eyes this makeup
tutorial is going to show you how to
really enhance your eyes bring out all
the different colors that you have with
a new Brown eyes because there's a lot
of brown eyes are not just Brown there's
a lot of hazel or there might be a
little bit of green in there and this
eye tutorial is definitely going to show
you how to just make them pop honey so
you can work with them so I am gonna be
using at the BH Cosmetics enhancing eyes
palette this is specifically for big
beautiful brown eyes it doesn't say big
but it does say beautiful brown eyes and
these are great shades to foreground
eyes purples are obviously one of my
favorites to aware for brown eyes I just
think it really enhances them so
beautifully there's only one eyeshadow
that I did not use for this quad because
I wanted a lighter champagne to kind of
put in the center but that's it
everything else on my eyes is from this
palette I really hope you guys enjoy
this video just remember whatever eye
color you have enhance it love it it's
you it's who you are so what makes you
beautiful so I really hope you enjoy it
thank you so much for watching don't
forget to give it a thumbs up if you
liked it and subscribe to my channel and
let's just go ahead and get started
first thing we're going to do is prime
our eyes and I'll leave what I use down
below and I'm using the BH Cosmetics
enhancing eyes palette we're gonna take
this shade right here and put this
directly into the crease I really love
this color as a transition shade it's
nice and warm and it's not too dark so
it's perfect to use as a transition
shade keep in mind
to add more product to make it darker or
use less product to make it lighter then
after I'm done blending all of that out
we're gonna go in with this really
pretty shimmery kind of what is it I
think it's not periwinkle but it's a
different type of purple you're just
gonna put this all over our lid but
we're gonna leave the inner corner bare
so just pack that color on all the way
to the crease you don't want to go above
the crease with this color we're just
gonna keep it right on the lid
they're gonna take this shade right here
the kind of gold shade and we're going
to put this in the inner corner this is
just going to lighten it up
so I forgot to show a clip but I did put
my blending brush into the first shape
that we use as our transition shade and
I'm just using a little bit of that
color to blend out the edges of this
eyeshadow so we don't have any harsh
lines
then taking the shade from makeup
forever and I'm just gonna put this
right on the center of the eye it's just
really gonna make the eyes pop and add a
lot of dimension to this look I really
love doing this so I'm just gonna apply
it there and then take a blending brush
and blend out the edges just so again
there's no harsh lines then you want to
go ahead and take off all the tape and
then what we're gonna do is go in with
that same transition color and once
again blend it into the crease because
I'm a blending person I blend a lot and
I just go back and forth with this now
I'm taking Costa reach eyeliner from Mac
this is amazing for brown eyes this just
brings out so many different colors in
your eyes I love it and it's not super
harsh at all it just it looks so
beautiful then I'm going to take balm
cosmetics eyeliner this isn't a deeper
purple color I'm just gonna put this on
an outer portion of my upper lash line
and also a little bit in the inner
corner since my eyes are more droopy I
just like to have a little bit of
eyeliner on the edge if I'm gonna have
any at all just to kind of shape out my
eyes a little bit better and since our
eyes shadow is more angled but this will
also help go with that and just really
lift the eyes up so if you have Juby
eyes I definitely recommend both of
these techniques
then we're gonna take Co streets again
and line the upper waterline I don't
show it because it just looks funky and
then I'm taking a benefit roller lash
and applying this you could leave it
like this if you want to but I wanted to
add some lashes so I'm taking these
House of lashes lashes named siren and
so I just put those on now I did do my
face and my camera did not record so I'm
so sorry about that you guys believe my
foundation routine down below that you
can check out I don't know what happened
my camera's been acting up so I'm sorry
about that
but I did also use a purple on my lower
lash line I'll leave the name down below
that's on the palette and then I took
the same transition shade and just
blended that out really really simple
and then I'm going in with the Clinique
bomb lash mascara and applying that and
then I'm going to take that gold shade
one more time and just touch it up in
the inner corner just to really make it
pop
I'm taking strip down from Mac and
lining my lips then taking Too Faced
melted lipstick in melted sugar I think
I did not realize how pale this was I'm
not into pill news like this so I
definitely had to go in with a darker
lip gloss and darken it up and then that
would be pretty much the look so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this makeup
look let me know if you try it out and
if you get this palette it's perfect for
enhancing your brown eyes so thank you
guys so much for watching it don't
forget to like the video and I'll see
y'all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
