on brushes that I recommend and I'm not
gonna make this a long drag-out video
explaining why I love each brush in
detail I'm just letting you know which
ones I love and the ones you've
basically seen in almost all of my
videos I also want you guys know that I
did start up my vlog channel so I will
put that link down below I had so many
requests for you guys to put the vlog
channel back up so I finally did it I
just sat down and started to pack up I
hope you guys go subscribe I'll be
putting more vlogs and stuff up there
and just fun videos that's not beauty
related and also this look I actually
just filmed this look but unfortunately
it was all out of focus so after we film
it again this was a look that I wore in
my bun tutorial video the three buttons
in there are five minutes if you haven't
checked it out I will leave the link
down below by the way excuse my hands
I've been trying to loot lemon juice
them and scrub them I've had a horrible
time with really dry hands and I totally
forgot to wash them after my self tanner
so
alright so the first brush I want to
talk about is the
I talk about literally every single
video tutorial the Sigma tapered kabuki
f-86 I love this brush so much
especially for my under eye areas I use
it to blend out concealer set it with
powder anything to do with my under eye
area I use this brush I highly recommend
it super soft and it just is amazing
it's really thick and also is super
brushes I have never experienced any
problems with them the handles falling
off bristles falling out nothing I stand
by Sigma I know some people are like oh
you're just saying that cuz Sigma will
send you stuff but most of the brushes I
have from Sigma I purchased myself like
the mr. bunny set and an extra e 25 and
the tapered blending brush I bought
myself they'll just send out their new
things but I don't say I like them
because they'll send me stuff that's
just not how it works if I don't like
something I'm gonna let you know but I
really do enjoy Sigma brushes I think
they're amazing so this one's definitely
my favorite front under eyes and it's
the Sigma tapered kabuki f-86 like I
said moving on I do have the expert face
brush from Real Techniques I think this
is such a great brush for foundation I'm
using it a lot lately I kind of
neglected it for a while but I went back
to it recently and I just forgot how
much I loved it this can leave
brushstrokes so I go in with my Beauty
Blender and just kind of Pat that in to
make it look more seamless but this is
great it's really soft nice and dense
you could even use this for contouring
if you wanted to this you can get at
Ulta I also mention this Real Techniques
brush this is the blush brush and it's a
really full full of a brush I like this
to bronze my face book I use it with my
NARS Laguna a lot I actually had this in
action in my no makeup makeup tutorial
so I'll leave that link down below if
you want to see it but I really like it
super super soft I don't even use it for
powder in my t-zone so I highly
recommend
this one next person I wanna mention is
this Sedona lace 850 brush this is just
a blush brush I love it this is my go-to
it's just super full it does shed pretty
bad but I still really like it and use
it non-stop so I will leave the link for
this down below and then the last brush
for my face is this Sigma angled kabuki
f-84 it's a really dense angled brush
and I love this you can use it for
foundation contouring which is what I
have been doing lately it's just super
fluffy really soft and nicely dense so I
really like yeah I used to use it for
foundation all the time but now I use it
with browsers next to are just kind of
basic brushes that I got with my mr.
funny set this is a sigma large powder F
30 it's just a really nice powder brush
you can get this individually on Sigma's
website as well I think it's just a
regular black bristled blur brush though
but this one's really great a lot of
people ask me where I get my powder
brush and I got it and I missed your
buddy set and then also the duo-fiber
f50 really love this one from sigma as
well blends out my blush and bronzer
amazingly moving on to eyes I don't have
a lot of eye rushes I just want to
mention the few favorites that I have
because these are just ones I always
always use so the first one is D Sigma
tapered blending e-40 and it's just a
tapered blending brush I love this brush
is so fluffy and blends out your crease
color amazingly it's just one of those
brushes you have to have in your
collection and it really does make a
difference brushes will make a huge
difference in your makeup and you really
really need this one so again it's the
Sigma e-40 and I haven't had any
problems with shedding anything like
that so awesome another one that you
really need in your collection is these
Sigma blending e 25 this is such a
universal brush I can't get enough of it
I have four of these because I keep
purchasing on because I use them all the
time I used three different ones for my
eyelet today and I just I love it it
really does make them living a freakin
breeze last one from Sigma is the flat
definer be 15 this is just a flat brush
it's a good dupe for the Mac 212 which I
do use as well but this is great you can
use it for your brows you can use a tail
line underneath your lash line you can
use it to line your top line you can use
this to pack up color it's another great
brush to have I really really like it
I've been using it a lot to put
concealer underneath my brows and just
get that sharp edge under there so I
love it I use it for everything and the
last one is a drugstore brush I've had
this for literally years I've had it for
so so long
it's the Revlon all-over shadow brush I
got this like when I first started
wearing makeup and I loved it to
highlight my brow bone I mean I always
tend to go back to it it just goes right
underneath my brow bone perfectly and I
just I can't get enough of it so again
this is the Revlon all-over shadow brush
so those are all the brushes that I
recommend and really truly loved and
have stood by and used for a while I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
also I've had a ton of questions about a
new makeup collection video because I
have definitely updated the whole
collection don't know if I want to do
another one I did one not too long ago
but I say if you can get this video to
5,000 likes I'll do another makeup
collection video so if you want to see
that video then like this video and if
it's the 5,000 I'll do it for you guys
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video
and don't forget to subscribe and I'll
see you guys through next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
