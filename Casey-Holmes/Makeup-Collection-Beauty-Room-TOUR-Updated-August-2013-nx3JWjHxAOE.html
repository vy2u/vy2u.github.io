collection and then go to the Beauty
room afterwards I know a lot of you are
more interested in the makeup collection
so I'm just going to go ahead and you
know give you an overview show you guys
what's changed and it's changed a lot
since my last makeup collection video so
I'll link that one down below if you
want to see it and let's just go ahead
get started so first thing is this
drawer I talked about last time it's my
Alex 9 drawer you can get it from Ikea
and then this table right here is from
Ikea along with the chair and then this
is a mirror from vanity girl Hollywood I
have a ton of questions people asking me
is it worth the money because it is
pretty expensive
honestly the light payoff I don't think
the best for makeup I would want to
switch the bulbs out to maybe like
natural light bulbs instead of the ones
that it comes with because I don't feel
like it necessarily gives off that grade
of light I mean that's just my opinion
but I bought it because I love how big
the mirror is because it is a huge
mirror and you just look so glam in the
makeup collection so yeah I thought the
lighting was going to be a little bit
better but I'm not that impressed to be
quite honest with you okay so moving on
like I said this is the whole setup down
there that some products have to do a
haul on along with this one so you can
just disregard those but let's start
over here so I over here I have my nume
straightener holder and then my nume
megastar flat iron I always have coupon
codes for them down below so you can
check that out if you're interested I
have my Mac bag that's full of products
that I'm gonna do first impressions on
and then over here this is my Bath and
Body Works hand sanitizer in summer
escape and it smells like a dream then
over here we have my Urban Decay b6
spray philosophy total madness I have
some kombuchas right there so then back
here I do have my brushes and then this
really really big mirror is actually
from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and it was like
40 dollars I think but it's a huge
mirror so it's great especially for
videos so I have something
and close up like I said this is for a
hall so you can just excuse that oh yeah
that's basically the whole tabletop I
have right there everything else is
pretty much stored away and also down
here I have a Sephora bag that's full of
products I regret buying moving on to
the top of my Alex nine drawers I do
have two of these lipstick holders and
skews my hand I got swatches galore on
it these are two lipstick acrylic
holders from Amazon I will put a link
below you can google acrylic lipstick
holders and it'll pull right away on
Amazon holds 24 lipsticks so these are
all the lipsticks that I have and I keep
them stored up right here so I can see
all of them just so you know I don't
miss out on any of them and I can
remember what colors I actually have and
plus it looks really pretty right so
then back here I have my Mac brush
cleanser and then this is actually a
bath and Bodyworks candle i depotted
everything I've done this a lot so to
the subscriber who told me how to put a
hot boiling water in it lets sit
overnight thank you because I've been
using these for so many different things
but this is where I keep setting sprays
and like my little bitty brush cleaner
so I have my mac fix+
skin and Aniyah midnight and then my Mac
brush cleaner like I said have those
stored in the middle and then over here
I just had my two Beauty blenders back
here these are cups that are actually
from Sonia Kashuk you can get them at
Target I got these a while back and
they're cute they have like little
brushes on them but I have two back here
that just store my extra brushes if I
need them so these mainly stay clean and
then I have another Bath and Body Works
candle and this stores my bigger brushes
like the real technique brushes because
the handles are so large that they don't
fit in a lot of different containers
very well so having an extra bath and
Bodyworks candle to hold all these is
great and yeah just keep a bunch of my
different brushes in there now moving on
this is the top drawer of my Alex 9
drawers this is all my eye stuff so I
have individual shadows in here
had like pigments here from nyx pigments
from Maybelline Mac I have Mac penguin
solely back I also have color tattoo
stigma shadows
you know just random individual shadows
I have little palettes like this I store
in here and if you're wondering I have
like little sex like this in here I
actually got these from Walgreens and it
comes in a set so it comes with this
this one which is a really nice big one
I comes with this little skinny guy and
then comes with a baby one which I will
show you here in a minute so these are
great they actually store pretty nicely
in the Alex 9 drawer and I really like
the way that it looks I think it just
looks so nice and nothing too much you
know so yeah I got these at Walgreens I
think they were like 8 for each set and
in this one I just keep like my Naked
basics palette brow bar to go maybelline
quads may wait and while my Paint Pots
in here just you know stuff I reach for
a lot just my little mini palette and
then again I do have little clouds over
here as well Kat Von D those are the her
palettes and then left went wild and I
keep extra shadow bases from Sigma in
the back as well like it says is
basically all my eyes stuff and then
over here I have some tools are in here
I have tweezers I have what is this
called eyelash curler I have this little
guy for your eyes eyebrows to kind of
shave extra hair that you know scissors
and then I have my brow products in here
extra brushes ones that are you know
dual ended primers are in here yeah just
kinda like miscellaneous for your eyes
tools brows whatever goes right here so
that's the first drawer now in the
second drawer it's still kind of
miscellaneous um I have in this little
guide this is actually from Dollar
General I just took off the handles on
the side but I got this and it stores
all my lashes I obviously need to
restock because I pretty much use almost
all of them natural ones up but all my
lashes go in there along with lash glue
and this is the other little guy that
comes in
set with the net baskets from Walgreens
and right here this is where I keep all
my mascaras I go through this pretty
often and kind of get rid of ones I
don't use and I keep little samples in
here as well so that's where they all
stay this is like eyelashes in a little
case from weeks and then I have a lip
erase and my Nivea lip butter right here
this is where I'm keep like sample
lipsticks like this my keep lip gloss is
lip liners all of that just chills in
here and then in the back I have
individual shadows as well and this
little guy I keep all of my eyeliners if
it's gel stick liquid anything but
that's just what I keep in there this
drawer is my favorite because I am a
face junkie right over here I do keep
primers I have my benefit primer the
15-hour one as well this one from
L'Oreal and some Yves pearl primer and I
just keep those right there because they
fit and I just you know work pretty well
in this area and then right here I keep
all of my foundations and tinted
moisturizers and obviously this powder
from Dior as well but I also have like
little samples of primers in here and
got anything to do with foundation
tinted moisturizers or anything like
that they go in this little drawer here
I have powders and a concealer palette
from matte so I just keep most of my
powders in here yes I do use all of them
I've gone through my makeup collection
and I have a huge bag full of stuff to
give away to my friends and family so
these are things that I reach for now I
do have just you know regular powders
this makeup for everyone that I'm sadly
almost out of because Sephora does not
want to restock this for some reason and
then here I keep another little mesh
basket and this has my concealers in it
so any concealers that I use or anything
and yeah they just everything in this
makeup collection is updated so these
are things that I do use and in the back
I have extras of stuff I have an extra
Eve pearl primer I have some samples
back there I have my covergirl corrector
everything like that this is another one
of my favorite drawers again it has to
do a face product so I love it
this is all of my high-end stuff so my
Mac mineralize skinfinish Azhar here my
Mac blushes I have NARS more NARS
blushes and bronzers that have bronzers
here Chanel the bomb
Too Faced then I have some benefit
products Smashbox what are these called
tart
laura geller the bomb here I keep my
Milani breath blushes they fit so
perfectly just right in here and then I
also have a L'Oreal lift blush then down
here I keep my the balm highlighter and
bronzer over here I have my favorite
blushes from the drugstore at their
Jordana
I love these blushes and then I have
like a little bitty tart one a NYX one
Physicians Formula
and then NYC just all the other drug
store stuff and then I have Tarte back
here as well because they didn't fit
anywhere else and then this is basically
the last of the makeup is my palette
drawer I moved this down here because I
tend to reach from them down here a lot
more than I did when they were up top so
I have like this little one from Mac my
Mac regular shadow whatever you call it
have a blush palette from them being
cosmetics in here I have Laura the balm
naked palettes from Urban Decay more
urban decay Sigma shadow kit NARS blush
palette and then I have like all easy
palettes I love Z palettes i depotted
all my wet and wild shadows in here
which is why I have so much room in my
eyes or just these little guys come in
such great handy because it gives you so
much more storage in your makeup
collection and I just love them and it's
great
Travel so okay this next drawer I keep
my extensions laid out in here I like to
keep them here because it's just a nice
drawer and they're not all tangled up
together they're just nice and laid out
I also keep these double-sided little
q-tips these are my faves I got these
from Walgreens keep some makeup remover
wipes in here and this is what I was
storing my makeup in um in these drawers
they're from Dollar General but ever
since I got the ones from Walgreens I
liked them a lot better so I just have a
ton of these now cuz I went and spent
like five or six dollars on all of them
which is not that at all so if you're
looking for alternative definitely
recommend the black trays from Dollar
General and I have like my Sephora Rouge
card in there and my ponds BB creams
that I'm going to possibly give away I
don't like this BB cream but pun can
give it away from family and friends and
here I just have like extra curling
irons I also have some makeup bags I
have like a Tory Burch one that cracked
which made me so upset and then I'm
Michael Kors one in the back I also have
this hourglass box and some little
containers that need to be cleaned so I
can use them again that's what I use to
put my foundation or concealer on so I
don't have to use my hands and again
this little clear guy is from our
general so here I keep more of my
curling irons and that's basically all
it's in here is just more and more
Colliers and yeah they love this because
they're stored away and there's not
cords like everywhere so this 9 drawer
comes in great use even if it's not all
for makeup it can be used for like all
your other girl products that are in the
way and then this drawers kind of like
my messy miscellaneous drawer I have
more of those little brow shaper guys I
have this which is an Ipsy bag full of
bobby pins and hair ties you know cool
things have some stock in here have nail
polish remover my brush ask my
straightener is in here you know just
miscellaneous stuff and then a lot of
the random
things are in this pink bag as well so
that is pretty much my makeup collection
and where I store all my makeup now and
I'll go ahead and show you guys the room
okay so this is what the Beauty room
looks like from the door just give you a
quick little turn around now yep those
are my lights keep in mind this room is
not done actually I wanted to get y'all
suggestions on a bunch of different
things so if you have any decorating
ideas because these walls go pretty far
up I would love to know what you would
think I want to get rid of that Marilyn
poster and do something else but I can't
think of anything so if you're creative
and you're a big room decor type person
and please let me know your suggestions
down below I would love to know so let's
go ahead and get on to the tour okay so
over here to the left of the door and
have this big mirror if you watched my
last makeup collection video this was
the mirror that I had on my vanity and
then going down I do have my self
tanning spray guy and I just put those
shoes up there the other day so excuse
it and that's my hair dye as well so I
have a bunch of things on top of it
right now because I'm trying to get pack
in for LA but yes that's my spray tan
system for a million dollar tan I still
love it still use it it's great so I
just keep it right there and then that
little table right there is actually
what I use for filming I said it in
front of my camera and I just you know
film away and set all my products on
there and it came in great handy
actually got that from Target now for
this side um this is right next to the
door I have my nail polish rack I
actually got this off of Amazon and if
you are interested in it you can just go
to Amazon and type in acrylic nail
polish holder and millions of them pop
up I don't know exactly which one I got
but it's one of the acrylic ones and
then I do have a sign up top that's just
like a little nice quote I love things
like this in my room it's just really
girly and I love inspirational stuff
like that and then over there I have
crossbody bags and my Michael Kors bag
and Victoria's Secret blah blah blah
they're just hanging on this little TJ
Mack hook that I got I think it's like
eight bucks or something hey I'm not a
purse collector honestly if I don't use
a purse it's the same on my clothes if I
don't use my clothes or my purses I end
up just going and giving them away
because I don't use them so the only
kind of persons I like to actually keep
are my high-end ones which of course is
basically my Michael Kors stuff and then
I keep my crossbodies a lot of the time
so because I use crossbodies a lot so
those are the only kinds of courses I
keep and wristlet it's all keep but
anything else I kind of just you know
give it away or take it to the
consignment shop okay so moving on to
this over here and excuse the cords if
you see them these are for my lights
that's just you know YouTube problems
that Mak bag right there is actually
products I've used up so I keep them in
there then they have like little flowers
and Colton's picture yes I still AM
engaged a lot of you have been asking
I'm still engaged and then right there
is one of my Muji drawers I just you
know keep all them because they were
expensive so I just you know keep them
and if I need them I'll use them and
then I also have this little guide that
says be your beautiful best I got that
with a pons package with those BB creams
I showed earlier and I don't like the BB
creams but I love the packaging so I
kept that and then down below also this
table is from Ikea as well if you're
wondering and then this down below these
are youtube chairs I got I hit a hundred
thousand subscribers so you could get
like a backpack or chair little chairs
and I decided to go ahead and get those
and then down below there are just some
boxes and I want to keep for now maybe
for future reviews and also a Muji
drawer as well and they're right beside
it I'm not a huge jewelry collector I'm
more of a studs and Marines kind of
person that I am necklaces so that's
just where I keep my necklaces and some
of my earrings and studs most of them
are right there in that little silver
box but yep that's
just what's on top of there and like I
said you know this wall is super big so

it and my camera charger I have a Eiffel
Tower picture and I have like extra
makeup that I'm giving away to family
and friends behind it and I'm a total
90s kid so hello to the stereo I've had
this for a few years now and I just
can't come around to selling it even
though I probably will but I'm such a
90s kid I've always had a stereo since I
can remember so that's just chilling
there because there's nowhere else to
put it and then this is my old makeup

a huge perfume collector but these are
the ones that I do have then over here I
have self tanners and body lotions and
