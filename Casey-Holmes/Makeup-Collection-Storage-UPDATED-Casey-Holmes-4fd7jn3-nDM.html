vanity
those drawers right there are the Alexa
or the Alex nine drawers I'll put all
the correct names down below this is the
mound or these are all from Ikea and
then over here I just have an extra
table that I bought at Target for
filming videos but I got my mirror from
TJ Maxx a while back I don't really like
it with the vanity but it's what I had
so it's what I'm working with starting
with these clear drawers all the clear
drawers are from Muji com I will put the
link down below but I really like these
shores they're just really nice so this
first drawer you mostly have just eye
product so I just have like mascaras
liners this little aqua seals are makeup
forever just a bunch of different
eyeliners and mascaras that I like to
switch out and then in this one it's
basically my pigments
you're just some Mac pigments color
tattoos holiday and powder and some
extra Sigma shadows in this next drawer
I just like to keep other pigments some
of these L'Oreal infallible eyeliners or
eyeshadows I have two Kat Von D palettes
a sigma eyes shadow Mac rocker Republic
and two other palettes this one's from
Victoria's Secret and this one's from
lorac down here I just have some more
eye shadows some Maybelline quads went
wild cause another Sigma single
eyeshadow a revlon matte shadow in the
urban decay vegan palette and some tarts
motorize and this was like my very first
Chanel eyeshadow I've ever purchased and
it's pretty amazing down here I really
honestly I had extra face stuff down
here but it always always always forgot
about them and I never use them so I
just decided to put extra brushes in
here that I couldn't fit in my little
containers so I just have some sigma
precision brushes and just extra
foundation brushes and contour brushes
if I want to use a different one
moving on to over here I of course have
my Sigma brush holder that came with my
mr. bunny set that I bought like forever
ago and I have my face brushes over here
and then of course my eye brushes are
over there and then I have my two elf
kabuki brushes
this one's really old so I recently
bought a new one just to have a nice
little backup and then here this is like
my everyday kind of makeup the makeup I
always tend to go to the most and then
up top this is just a lipstick holder
you can get this from Amazon and it
holds quite a few lipsticks so this is
the two drawer from Muji it's a little
bit bigger than the five drawer just has
a lot more space this one I just have
some bronzers my naked basics and brow
bar to go everyday use things my
covergirl corrector concealer everything
that I pretty much use on a day-to-day
basis and then in here same thing I have
a lash card some Sigma eyeshadows blush
and bronzer or BB cream primer and my
makeup forever duo matte powder moving
on over here I have my little mirror and
then this is basically my face store and
then I have my little Beauty Blender
just chilling over there so this first
drawer is just concealers Mac let's see
the makeup forever

like a bronzer from the balm blush
palette from NARS or lorac powder
apocrypha powder laura geller

they're really really pretty
and very similar to Mac and then in here
I just have some more Mac products I
make extra makeup forever foundations
these Maybelline blushes some lip liners
and lip glosses in the back so with the
mountain dressers you can open them up
or the drawers and that's about how far
they come it's alright I mean I like it
but sometimes it can be a pain in the
butt so I just have some
I have my Mac palette from a holiday
collection tweezers my mac eyeshadow

wild Zee pot that i depotted a bunch of
wet and wild shadows in I also have my

fan of face products and just have some

is a skin tone color and totally erases
the color of your lips so back here I
just have extra lashes and extra Mac
creme de nude lipstick lip glosses
primers lash glue tweezers are not
tweezers eyelash curlers a what is this
eyeliner brush from Sigma and of course
I keep to hair clips it's just really
easy to reach for them right here so I
just keep two okay so that is it for the
vanity part that's basically all I keep
in there I try not to pack this up too
much moving on to my Alex and
Dora I bought this because I figured if
I were to get more makeup this will
store everything and it also stores a
bunch of my hair products and I just
figured you know buying this it would
save me a lot of time and money on extra
storage so I went ahead and spent the
money and just went ahead and bought the
biggest things when I keep on top of
this it's just perfumes I have Jimmy
Choo Victoria's Secret Angel pink
chiffon Express when you're struck I
have this Physicians Formula von braun's
booster I keep some sprays up here brush
cleaner my dry shampoo my nail polish
remover hair spray lotions from Bath and
Body Works and then in the very back I
have these little brush holders that I
got from Sonia Kashuk and they just have
like little brushes on them and these
are what I store my extra makeup brushes
in and I just keep them in the back
first door I just have a Sephora bag
back here with extra Z palette magnets
and like I said having a huge face
junkie so I have just extra foundations
and BB creams have a Ben Nye banana
powder or Yves pearl and I shine some
other setting sprays and extra skin and
a new one just a bunch of extra
foundations whenever I buy one
foundation it works really well I
usually buy two same kind because like I
said I do self tan so my color kind of
fluctuates and then in this drawer is
makeup I'm giving away to family and
friends anybody who wants it I just kind
of pile up the makeup here and I'll give
it away to my friends I have a little
benefit bag and then this BB cream from
there's just formula but yeah this is
basically everything I kind of give away
in here I have extra palettes Naked 2 Z
palette catwalk palette BH Cosmetics and
then some extra eye shadow bases from
Sigma and then that's pretty much it all
the drawers are nice and empty so I have
a lot more storage room if I need it so
in here I keep all of my curling irons
extra barrels and
I'm curling iron that I need or Hannah
it's in here so I love that because it
gets them out of the way and you can't
really see how much and they're just
stored in this nice little thing and
then in this store I just have my
straighteners in here teasing combs
hairbrush
extra little clear ties extra clips hair
dye some crab extensions hair bows
pretty much anything in a gloves anybody
comes over and wants to see crawling
irons but wants to have a glove I've got
that by James pretty much anything
that's what I keep down here it's kind
of miscellaneous and I have cards down
here that people have given me because I
never give away cards or anything that
people want to send so that is pretty
much it guys that's my little vanity
tour I hope you enjoyed it I actually
love the storage now and it makes it
look a lot nicer in here and not so
cluttered so I'm loving it and make sure
