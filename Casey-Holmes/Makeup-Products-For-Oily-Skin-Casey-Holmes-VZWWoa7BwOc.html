all about products that I recommend for
oily skin I've actually gotten quite a
bit of questions on you know primers and
foundations and everything like that
because a lot of you have let me know
that we have the same skin type you're
very oily and there's not a lot of
people out there I feel like that do
videos that have very very very oily
skin like I do kind of hard to find
products that will work for me if you
know they like something it's just kind
of hard to find stuff that will work for
me the same way because I have super
oily skin there's no dryness about it
it's just super super oily so I wanted
to do this video for you guys today
because I'm gonna help you out I know a
lot of you have been telling me that you
know you have the same skin type as me
and you love the recommendations I've
given you so far there is Joe starting
as high end so hopefully you can maybe
find something that will suit to your
need
I'm sorry if you can hear the ruckus in
the background the guys are playing call
of duty and you know they get crazy with
that kind of stuff it for primers I have
not found a drugstore primer that is
great at keeping me mad I have tried
quite a few and I just haven't found
anything that you know helps keep me
looking that all day I think a lot of
them are mainly towards people with dry
skin so the ones that I have are
high-end but they're really great and I
definitely recommend them so the first
one I want to talk about is one you guys
have heard me talk about a thousand
times
it's a Mac prep and prime skin refine
zone and I love this primer because it
does help keep you matte and it also
helps with pores I know if you probably
have really oily skin like I do you have
larger pores in this area and it's just
something that kind of comes along
sometimes with oily skin you just kind
of have to deal with it but I love this
because it helps reduce your pores and
also helps keep you Matt for a very long
time I love this primer is so good and a
lot of you see me use the pore fessional
with this I like it it is oil free but I
don't think this keeps me mad sometimes
I feel like it makes me more oily so all
I use this for is to kind of put it in
the areas I have very large noticeable
pores and then I go over everything with
this primer and it'll help keep me matte
and then these two are just so other
ones I want to include I actually got
this as a hundred Point Park from
Sephora SP Becca ever matte poreless
priming Perfector this is very good and
then another one I have is the Yves
pearl anti-shine mattifying gel i used
to rave about this one all the time and
these are both kind of like the same
thing i personally feel like these are
the kind of treatments that are these
are the kind of primers that you would
want to put in the areas you are super
oily because sometimes I find myself
wanting to put this all over my t-zone
and everything but then I start having
like these white patches where you can
see where I put the primer and it's just
because it dried out so much and it
really is try to keeping that so I would
just focuses on areas you get really
oily which for me would be right here
right here in the center my forehead and
on my chin and that's where I would
apply these primers they're fantastic
though I highly recommend them if you
are looking for something to keep you
completely completely matte
the first one I want to talk about is
one I actually used for literally months
straight like I did not use another
foundation because I was just obsessed
with this one and it's the makeup
forever matte velvet plus now this is a
really great foundation for oily skin it
kept me very matte it has great coverage
it's beautiful on the skin I used to
love applying it with a Beauty Blender
which I still do but I only use it every
now and then because I have so many
foundations I just kind of rotate this
is really good super high coverage and
this looks like a little bottle but
honestly it lasts for so long I still
have three bottles of these in three
different shades because when I self-tan
my color kind of fluctuates I have a
couple more this one's almost empty but
I love it make sure you shake it up
really well before you use it and it's
perfect and just twist off the top and
you have a little squeezy which I like I
think it's convenient next I want to
talk about this hourglass foundation I
actually just did a review on this which
I will leave in the description box
below and you can check that out but
it's the Immaculate liquid powder
foundation it's oil-free this is very
mattifying I talked more about it in
that video I go a little bit more in
depth but this is a great foundation to
help keeping that especially if you have
a special event to go to and you want to
make sure you don't have to worry about
blotting your face the whole time this
is definitely the way to go it is so
good and I just I highly recommend it
it's like amazing I love this stuff next
I have these foundations from the
drugstore it's the covergirl outlast
stay fabulous foundations and these are
the best foundations by far in the
drugstore that I have ever tried these
do give you like a satin kind of finish
and what I love is that you can set with
a powder and be completely matte these
lasts for so long they make your skin
look beautiful it doesn't look like
you've kicked on your foundation or
anything like it is stunning there but
hands down the best drugstore foundation
ever I love this even with my oily skin
being excessively oily or anything like
that it just looks so pretty if you do
get a little shiny you can just blot
read powder throughout the day and
you'll be fine but I love these
foundations this is by far my favorite
one even better than the Revlon
Colorstay because Revlon Colorstay is
very thick if you want
those inaction I will leave my current
foundation routine down below in the
description box and you can check that
out hey last foundation is this NARS
sheer matte foundation and I love this
some people say they like sheer glow
even if they have oily skin but
personally my skin is just so oily I
always go to Matt I never purchased
anything with low in it I'm never go for
anything that says it's going to have
luminosity it's going to make me look
glowy I'm never go for products like
that because I already know it's gonna
make me super shiny
this one's really great and since my
whole face is pretty much oily it never
looks cakey or gross or anything like
that so I love this foundation I used to
use it so much back in the day and I
finally repurchased it and I just I love
it the pump does not come with it you do
need to purchase a pump separately
that's the only thing that kind of sucks
about it but it's it's a really great
foundation and I highly recommend it
now for baby cream this one's also from
the drugstore is the Garnier BB cream
they have one for dry skin or the dry
normal skin and then they have one for a
combination to oily skin and I love that
that's the only thing I don't like about
it is the smell the smell just smells
like kind of rubbing alcohol and it just
it reeks but this covers so well and it
lasts forever and literally I will stay
matte for the longest time and this is
the only BB cream I found that has
actually kept me completely matte for a
few hours like I mean for a BB cream
that's really great because sometimes
they don't even keep you mat for like
two hours so I love this highly
recommend it if you're just wanting
something quick from the drugstore not
too heavy on the skin you know not too
much coverage I would definitely try
this out if you have oily kind of combo
skin
last but not least is my favorite part
and that is powders so the first one I
want to talk about is this urban decay D
slick mattifying powder and I actually
got this off of hautelook a while back
it's just like a translucent powder but
this is really great I keep this in my
purse which is why you guys never see it
because I keep actually these two
powders I keep them in my purse at all
times this one's all sound like I set it
off
look I get a lot of things off of
HauteLook actually that's where I got my
Yves pearl mattifying down I'll leave a
link down below this is really good it
just helps keeps you matte it doesn't
add any extra coverage or anything and
just make sure your skin has that nice
matte finish you don't have any shine
and I love it I think it's great
packaging super cute and I'm super happy
I got that a while another one is from
the drugstore I haven't purchased like
two or three of these it's the
Maybelline Dream matte powders and you
can see this one's hit pretty good pan
but I have another one that's new in my
purse this is awesome I think this is so
comparable to a high-end powder just
because it's so fine and you can't
really tell that you have it on your
skin like you could keep piling this on
and it's not going to look cakey it just
it's so pretty I used to rave about this
all the time but I still love it I keep
it in my purse and it's amazing and the
color I have is medium a 1 and it's sand
and then the last one is like the most
expensive powder but it's so good it's
the Dior air flash matte touch this is
another product you better have super
oily skin or you don't even need to try
it because it is so mattifying
and I just adore this I think it's so
good it does have like this little beige
tint to it there's only one shade I love
this some people you can spray it on
like this if you want to but I like to
spray onto the brush and then Pat it
into my skin just because if I spray it
on sometimes it gets a little too
powdery so I just like to have more
control spray on the brush press into my
skin and I stay matte for literally
hours like it's so good it's very pricey
I was for a couple months now and I
still have quite a bit of product left
so I love this stuff I think it's great
and I hide
recommend it so that is it I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
obviously everything I mentioned was
something that's going to help to keep
you more Matt I know since I have oily
skin I mainly want to find products that
is going to keep me very matte and I
don't want to look shiny throughout the
day so those are the products that I
recommend if you have any products that
you recommend then leave them down below
in the comments I would love to see them
and maybe try out some new ones don't
forget to like it and subscribe to my
channel and I will see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
