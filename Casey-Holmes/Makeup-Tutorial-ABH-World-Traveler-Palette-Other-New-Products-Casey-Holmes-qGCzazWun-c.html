another makeup tutorial this look right
here very dramatic very bold you use
this for fall you can use this for
summer any time of the year I just
wanted to play with my Anastacio world
traveler palette correct yes world
traveler palette and love this I was
wanting to use the more green gold in
here but I ended up gravitating towards
this shade named chic and I put that in
the inner part of the eye but if you
guys want me to do another makeup look
with this and use the green gold let me
know I think it would be perfect for
fall with like a fun lip color that I
have in mind so let me know if you guys
want to see that tutorial in the
comments below but I love this pot so
much I think it's beautiful it's
pigmented as always honest Asya always
kills it with these palette I love it's
like I really really love that you guys
requested a makeup look with this
palette and I just winged it and it came
up with this one doesn't necessarily
match my I mean it kind of matches my
shirt but not really you know I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and if
you want to see how I got this look then
just keep watching okay the first color
we're gonna take is this one in Morocco
and we're gonna use this as our
transition shade to put into the crease
so I'm just gonna take a big fluffy
brush this one is from Sigma I hadn't
use this and forever but I have been
just falling in love with it lately so
I'm just using that to put that in the
crease and I'm sorry that for my right
eye it looks like the left eye for you
guys but for my right eye I didn't
realize I was so tilted away from the
camera so I'm sorry about that but
hopefully you still enjoy this video now
moving on we're gonna take this dark
brown called fudge and we're gonna place
this in the outer half and really just
fluff it onto the lid you do want to
take this into the crease but you want
to keep this mainly on the outer half
and focus a little tiny bit in the
crease you don't want to get too heavy
with it but you can put just a little
bit in there just to help kind of fade
it all out
now I'm we're gonna take this new our
color so it's the black and we're gonna
take a pencil brush and we're gonna act
like we're kind of smudging it and doing
a line on our upper lash line and like
we're gonna do a wing but we don't take
this all the way to the crease did that
make sense what I just said I mean you
can kind of see what I'm talking about
but you just want to put like a line
right there at your upper lash line and
then put just a tad bit on the outer
corner but don't take it to the crease
yet because we're just going to blend it
with the color fudge which is the one we
just put on and we're gonna just blend
this completely out you want to blend it
a little bit into the crease but you
mainly want to focus this shade on the
lid and on the outer corner where it
kind of wings out so just keep blending
these shadows blend absolutely
beautifully so you you shouldn't have a
problem if you do just keep blending
it's all about practice then I'm gonna
take this color called cheek and I love
this color so an incredibly much it is
so beautiful and I put this all over the
lid so I take it right up to the crease
and I do put it over the black because I
want this to be the more dominant shade
on the lid so I want to put as much on
as possible and then we'll go in and
deepen out the outer half in just a
second so you just want to build this
color up you don't really need that much
because it is so pigmented but yeah I
mean I I love this color it kind of is
like a silver green shade oh so
beautiful going back in I just lightly
dipped my brush in the black I mean you
can see right there I barely had any so
I'm just gonna fluff this into the outer
V like I said I didn't take it all the
way up to the crease just yet I just
focused it on the lid and mainly on the
outer half and really making it look
faded and just nice and blended out it
just gives a lot of depth and definition
and it looks really beautiful and smoky
which I love a smoky look so I went
ahead and primed my face with my
favorite primers and then I'm going to
line my eyes with this Make Up For Ever
ink liner it is a matte liner so all I
did was lined in my upper lash line and
just slight wing and
thing too thick or crazy I just wanted a
little bit of definition and I did use
lashes from house of lashes I will put
them down below they're my new favorites
right now I just think they're beautiful
but going in with my Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation absolutely been loving
this right now it's in the shade warm
beige I'm gonna apply this all over my
skin and then I'm going in with this
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I've
been back to using this lately I kind of
put it on a back burner for a while but
I've been really enjoying it lately so
I'm just gonna put it in the normal
areas that I put concealer which is
under my eyes and in the center of my
face to highlight so I'm just gonna
blend that out with a Beauty Blender
okay so now to set it I'm taking the
lorac contour or the Pro contour palette
and I'm taking the yellow shade and I'm
going to place this on all the areas
that we just put some concealer on
because you want to make sure you set
that concealer you don't want it move in
throughout the day
now I'm taking this is Yvonne she
bronzer I'll put the hang down below
because like I said it's you know
something I just can't pronounce and I'm
going to bronze my face with it I really
do love it it does give you a nice
healthy glow like it says this was my
first time using it and I really did
like it I was kind of nervous at first
because I didn't know how pigmented it
was gonna be but this is a beautiful
shade and it's a great color to build up
going back into that contour palette by
Laura I'm gonna take the light contour
shade and contour my face so just in the
hollows of my cheeks under my lip and it
also did my jaw and you'll see here in a
little bit I did my nose as well taking
this Estee Lauder sensuous Rose blush
I'm going to apply this because it
doesn't you know take away from the eyes
or anything but you still have that nice
flush to the skin and I think this color
is really beautiful for a bold statement
looks like this
now I'm just going to blend everything
out and then I'm taking this laura
mercier illuminizer in indiscretion and
this is beautiful again this is my first
time using it and I was like oh my gosh
I'm obsessed new favorite highlighter oh
my gosh it's beautiful if you don't have
it to stop it go get it right now
I just I love it so so much and then
right here I'm contouring my nose like I
told you guys I was going to do
and now I'm gonna fill in my brows with
my Anastasia dip brow in soft brown and
then going back into the palette we're
gonna take the soft peach shade and this
is a matte color and we're just going to
put this underneath the brow to
highlight and lift that Bravo
then we're gonna take this NARS
larger-than-life
eyeliner in Via Veneto if you've been
watching me for a while you know I'm
obsessed with this liner it's one of my
favorites and then to do the bottom lash
line we're gonna take fudge and we're
gonna line it with this flat definer
brush from Sigma and you just want to
press this right up against your lower
lash line really really really close to
your waterline and just build it up and
then to blend it out we're gonna take
Morocco again which is the very first
shade we used and blend this out it's a
very very very smoky look you don't have
to do it like this you don't have to do
it solo as well but it's just what I
prefer and I love a really dramatic bold
smoky eye
then of course you want to put on some
mascara this is the NYX skinny mascara
and it's perfect for your lower lashes
and then for lips we're taking the Urban
Decay 24/7 liner lip liner and this is a
1993 I have been obsessed with those and
we're just going to line our lips and
fill them in a tad bit then taking the
Urban Decay lipgloss and kinky we're
gonna top it over with that and you're
done I don't have any cute seal shots so
I'm very sorry but this is the end
