a makeup tutorial on this look this is
the same exact look that I had in my
last video which was my self-tanning
video so if you haven't seen that I will
link it down for you guys in the
description box below but I had so many
requests to do the makeup that I had in
that video so I made sure to remember
because I was gonna film this that day
and I was like now just go ahead and do
my makeup and then I immediately
regretted it when I didn't film it
because I like the way that it turned
out so I remembered every product that I
used on my face and that's what you'll
be seeing today this is a mixture of
high-end and drugstore so feel free to
change different things to fit your
needs and whatever products that you
have I'm using a new foundation that I'm
really obsessed with and it's from the
drugstore so I'm excited about that and
I wanted to bust out this palette I've
actually used it a lot over the past
couple of months but I just haven't done
a video on I don't know if she's selling
these I know she brought it back after a
certain amount of time so I'll leave a
link down below if I can find it if she
did come back out with these but it's
the Anastasia lavish palette and I
really love this palette I find myself
going to it a lot especially since the
beginning of this year I've just been
really really enjoying it so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this makeup look if you
do like it then please give it a thumbs
up and I'll go ahead and leave
everything I used with links in the
description box below so you can check
that out and I think that's it I hope
you guys enjoy and I will see you in my
next video
okay getting started with the makeup I'm
gonna dip into the on Stassi out lavish
palette and the first color we're gonna
be taking is orange soda with the Sigma
e-40 brush and we are just going to be
applying this color all into the crease
and even a little bit on the lid this is
going to be our transition shade so you
really just want to buff this color out
all over and I do like to kind of build
this color up
next up we're going with this nyx
pigment and it is in the color i forget
what color it is but i'll leave the link
down below I think it's called orange
pearl or something like that but it's a
really pretty color it's kind of an
orange copper shade those are definitely
my favorite kinds of colors to apply all
over the lid I just think they look so
pretty with brown eyes if you have blue
eyes it would be stunning as well so I'm
just going to be applying this all over
my lid I really want to make sure I pack
that color on
taking my Sigma e-40 I'm just going to
very lightly blend out that line
so now I'm taking the color Sienna and
I'm focusing on putting this in the
outer V and I do drag a little bit into
my crease and a little bit on the lid as
well
next we're gonna take the color truffle
and we are mainly focusing in this color
right in the outer V we don't want to
bring this really into the crease much
at all and you also want to kind of drag
it a little bit on the lid just so it
blends but don't get too crazy just
mainly focus on keeping this in the very
outer V and this will just deepen up the
look for you again taking the Sigma e-40
I am going to be blending again because
no matter what I'm doing I am always
blending it is so important to me so
yeah just blending away so I don't have
any harsh lines then we're going to go
ahead and take off the tape and I'm
taking a sigma e25 again and I'm not
putting any product on it but what do
you know I'm blending
all right moving on to primer I'm taking
this bareMinerals
BB prime time it's a tinted primer and
this is also great at color correcting
so it really helps counteract some of my
redness which I love so I'm just
applying that with a foundation brush
because I didn't want to get all over my
rings and then for foundation I have
been using the L'Oreal True Match nw6
with the Beautyblender Beautyblender is
by far my favorite way to apply this
foundation and I'm obsessed with it I
used to hate this foundation so I don't
know what happened but I'm loving it now
it's definitely my new favorite
foundation from the drugstore
taken my NARS radiant creamy concealer
in custard I'm just going to applying
this underneath my eyes and also
highlighting my face with this so I'll
put it on my nose top of my forehead my
lip and also my chin
taking my makeup forever super matte
loose powder this is in translucent
natural by far my favorite translucent
powder ever I'm telling you guys I've
used this for so long and every time I
try to switch different products I end
up going right back to it it is just
hands down my favorite loose setting
powder ever so I'm taking my Sigma F 86
and just setting underneath my eyes and
it will also be setting my face makeup
with this as well and the brush that I'm
using for this is the Real Techniques
powder brush taking in this Make Up For
Ever bronzer and my NARS eita brush yes
girl this is going super fast I'm going
to speed through this part as always
I'll leave a detailed contouring video
down below for you guys this is
definitely one of my new favorite
bronzers it is so nice it's not really
dark at all but it adds just enough
definition and it is stunning so I
highly recommend this bronzer if you're
in the market it is so good
next moving on the blushed I'm taking
this tart limited-edition blush palette
and I'll be taking the middle shade it's
kind of a peachy color and I'm going to
applying this all over my cheeks with my
Sigma blush brush then of course I'm
taking a duo fiber and just blending
that out
moving on to highlighter taking a cult
favorite which is the balms mary lou
manizer this stuff is bomb you have to
have it in your life seriously you can't
get any better than this highlighter and
it will literally last you forever so
get this and then also get the Sigma
f-35 because it makes highlighting a
dream and so easy to do
now moving on to brows I'm using the
Tarte Amazonian clay brow mousse in
taupe I promise I'll have a brow
tutorial coming for you very soon it's
on my list to do this week so stay on
the lookout for it as you can tell my
eyebrows are looking kind of crazy and
that's because I'm filling a brow
tutorial for you guys I'm gonna set them
in place with my Anasazi up brow gel and
Burnett this stuff is amazing going in
with my new favorite liner this is a NYX
two-timer liquid liner and pencil
eyeliner duo or : or whatever I'm gonna
line my upper and lower waterline and
this eyeliner duo is perfection the only
thing is the top for the liquid liner
part did not stay on for me so mine's
all dried out and all over my Louis
Vuitton purse taking the Jordana liner
in a brown I definitely have to get a
new one of this because it's pretty
dried out so I'm going to apply my
Skerritt and apply these lashes from the
Lord they're my favorite they're in the
doll me up style and then going back in
with truffle while those lashes dry I'm
just going to further deepen up that
outer V
taking cream from the pallet I'm going
to be highlighting right underneath my
brow bone and then taking that truffle
shade again with a pencil brush I'm just
going to smudge this all underneath the
lower lash line
now I'm gonna take this clinic bottom
lash mascara I really like this stuff it
gets all the little hairs and makes them
look super long and like really kind of
spidery but I like that look so I'm just
going to apply this all over my bottom
lashes and I'm also going to do the very
inner corner of my natural lashes just
so it goes along really nicely with my
false ones taking my lipliner from
Jordana and tawny I'm just going to line
out my lips with this just a little bit
darker than my natural lip color and I'm
going to be taking this Kardashian
chroma lip pencil I forget the color but
it's the coral one I'll have it linked
down below and I'm going to apply this
all over my lips and then topping it off
I'm using my favorite NARS gloss and
this is an odalisque and it's a really
pretty peachy color as well so I hope
you all enjoyed this look thank you guys
