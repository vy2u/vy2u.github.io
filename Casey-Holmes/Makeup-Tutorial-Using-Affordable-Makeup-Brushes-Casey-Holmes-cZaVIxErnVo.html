video because I really like the way that
it turned out and I'm just really happy
so it is all about this makeup look
which I used a drugstore makeup and
affordable brushes for you guys which I
feel like is insane I figured I would
show you guys cuz I know a lot of you in
requesting drugstore makeup looks and
just more affordable products don't get
me wrong I love my Sephora and my
high-end makeup but it's great to you
know find things that are more
affordable to use instead of having to
go out and splurge on every single thing
hopefully you guys enjoyed this I used a
couple of pallets I haven't used ever
they've just been sitting in my drawers
and I really liked them and then I also
use brushes from morphe morphe is the
most affordable brush line I have found
and I am so insanely impressed by these
brushes like I I can't even deal you
know I didn't try them out for a really
long time because I was I'm so stuck on
my Sigma and Mac brushes that I was like
I don't know if I want to try them out I
finally tried them out and I've been
obsessing over them and especially this
one the what is number the M 439 amazing
foundation brush and also I just want to
say I used a couple of them for
different reasons like I used this one
for bronzer and blush just qualifying
different products that you can use in
multiple ways other than just one and I
must I love this duo fiber brush like I
mean you can use it for so many
different things the only brush that I
had to use I know some of you were
probably like really Casey but honestly
the only brush I did have to use was
this a flat shader brush and this is by
Mac now the reason why I used is because
I cannot find my flat shader brush from
morphe my favorite one I'll list it down
below I don't remember the numbers
because they all have different numbers
on them and I don't remember them but my
favorite one I'll leave it down below
for you guys but I can't find it
anywhere
thank you guys so much for watching I
really hope you enjoy it and let's go
ahead if you're wondering what my shirt
says it says cute guys sorry I thought
you said French fries just here
wondering okay let's get started by then
we're first gonna take the gilded gold
palette by old set we're gonna take this
shape right here with the m14 four more
and we're just going to blend this into
the crease this is the perfect
transition shade and I really love it a
lot
I love the matte shades in this palette
much more than I do the shimmery shades
I was going to use a shimmery shade in
this tutorial but it was just not
pigmented so I'm sticking to the mattes
so I'm going to take the color right
next to it and I'm gonna take this brush
which looks like the Mac 217 and I
really like it a lot so I'm gonna take
that color and put it right into the
crease and this is just gonna help kind
of define the eye contour out a little
bit and give some definition so you just
want to do that on both eyes and I
really love this brush because it's a
little bit more pointed than the Mac's
217 so it really gets right into that
crease and blend everything out then I'm
gonna take this a 5 15 brush and this is
a smaller more precise brush and I'm
going to take the two darker shades in
the palette and we're gonna do more of a
cut crease look so I'm going a little
bit above my crease and I'm just gonna
go in and put I'm focusing most of the
color on the outer half and flicking it
out and then I'm gonna drag the rest of
it right in as you can see what I'm
doing right here so you just want to
slowly build this up you don't want it
to be too dark or too heavy I just want
it to be pretty noticeable so again I'm
kind of flicking it out and putting most
of the color on the outer corner and
then just dragging it in the crease like
I said I am doing this a little bit
above the crease so it makes it look
like I have a more lid space and then
it's a tweezer break my brows are so bad
and then I'm going back in with that
brush we just used that looks like the
217 and we're just gonna slightly blend
this out you don't want to blend too
much because we do want that harsh kind
of cut crease look but you just want to
do a little bit so it's not looking
really jagged
then I'm gonna take this makeup geek
eyeshadow I cannot remember the name of
it but I will leave it down below it is
this beautiful beautiful seafoam green
color I guess you could say or mint I
don't know it's a mixture but it is
beautiful the only thing is you do have
to build it up so I probably went in
about three or four top three or first I
probably went it about three or four
times to build this color up to get it
to the intensity that I wanted but once
you get there I promise you it's worth
it and it's a beautiful beautiful shade
and I am just at the moment I saw it I
knew I had to do a tutorial
then I'm going back in and just touching
up a little bit again don't blend too
much you just want to blend the edges so
they seamlessly go in together then i'm
taking this nyx epic black liner with
that same brush we used for the cut
crease part and you can see how freakin
black this liner is it is so black I'm
obsessed with it I mean it is oh my god
so beautiful and this brush makes it
really easy to a nice winged liner and
it worked really well with this gel
liner so I mean hello a new favorite
combo this this liner is no joke yo they
call it epic black for a reason because
it is midnight black then we're gonna
take this NYX chest Jolie eyeliner in
line the upper lash line or upper
waterline I'm sorry and then I applied
my Koko lashes and goddess which I have
used constantly lately because I'm
obsessed with them and then going in
with this L'Oreal foundation I'm just
going to really buff it in with this
brush this L'Oreal foundation can
sometimes look patchy so you really want
to make sure you blend it into the skin
and I really like this brush with it
because it's really soft and it's pretty
big so it covers a pretty big area on
your face and gets the job done then I'm
going in with this la pro concealer and
blending it out again with this flat top
brush now you can see half of my body
looks warm and the other side looks very
just plain Jane and that is because I
had my vanity girl mirror on so I'm
sorry about that the color kind of looks
weird but I ended up turning it down in
a little bit so I'm gonna take that la
girl concealer and again highlight the
nose with it and on the chin because I
always contour my nose it's just what I
have to do and then to set everything
I'm taking my ELF I brighten ur which I
really love and I'm going to set it all
in place with this brush from morphe I
like this brush because it's not too
dense it's really light and fluffy and
it really just applies everything
seamlessly
taking this Ulta bronzer now if I had to
go back I would definitely use a
different bronzer because this one
didn't really show up on my skin that
well but if you're more fair I think you
would like it I just it was too light
for me
but I'm just gonna go ahead and blend
this on the areas where the Sun would
naturally hit and if you guys see rose
in the background I had no idea that she
was chewing on one of my tank tops so um
I went through this whole video without
knowing she is is so sneaky turn on the
light there we go a little bit better
the light's still on but you know we're
working with it taking this next contour
palette I'm gonna take this shade right
here which is probably the a shiest
of all of them and then using this
morphe brush I want to very lightly
contour my cheeks I have heard that this
NYX palette is super pigmented and it's
really hard to blend sometimes so I made
sure to build up the color and this
brush is really precise so I just wanted
to make sure I was careful with it
because I didn't want to go overboard
with the contour
taking this Paula do Matt blush I'm just
gonna add this to my cheeks with the
same brush we used for bronzer and I
like this color a lot because it just
adds a nice flush to the cheeks but it
doesn't overpower the eyes again with
that same brush we used for setting the
under eye I'm gonna take this Sonia
Kashuk eyeliner and I'm going to put
this on the top of my cheekbones I would
much rather use a shimmery eyeshadow
than this I was pretty disappointed by
it because it's not as intense as I wish
it was but if you're looking for a
really subtle highlighter I think you
would like it taking the NYX micro brow
pencil I think that's what's called I'm
going to fill in my brows this took me
quite a bit of time and I was playing
with rows so it took me quite a bit of
time so I just went ahead and skipped
over it and then I'm using the
Maybelline brow drama just to set
everything in place going back into that
palette I'm going to take the lighter
shade right here
and this is what we're gonna use to
highlight this brush is awesome because
it does have a tapered end so it gets
right under the brow perfectly so I'm
just gonna apply that right underneath
both eyebrows and then we're gonna go in
with this darker chocolate shade and
this brush and we're going to put this
right underneath the lower lash line I
didn't want to smoke out the lower lash
line too much I just wanted to put some
color down there and add a little hint
of smokiness and then we are going to
take that NYX liner we use to line the
upper waterline and we're going to use
it to line the lower lash line and you
can see right here how black this is
this is so intense the blackest eyeliner
from the drugstore that I have
personally seen and then I'm taking this
brush again and I'm going to just blend
out the color we put on the lower lash
line and the ultimate matte eye shadow
is really do blend very very well so I
didn't have to do too much work with it
then I took this covergirl mascara and I
went in to put it on my lower lashes and
I was like oh wait there's a little too
much right here let me fix this and then
they started clumping together and I was
like no okay I'm over it I'm done so I
went back to my trusted L'Oreal miss
manga mascara and affixed the situation
at hand so yeah I love this mascara it's
of one of my favorites from the
drugstore by far tain this Paula do
again lipliner in Gingerbread I'm going
to line my lips with this it's a great
neutral liner if you're looking for one
and then taking my ultimate favorite lip
color right now which is this NYX matte
lip cream is that what it's called I
can't read it but it's an espresso and
oh my gosh I get so many compliments
when I wear this lip color it is
beautiful and it dries really matte and
I just love it
I love these darker nudes and this one's
perfect so after that you are completely
done thank you guys so much for watching
