a very requested video it is makeup for
beginners now I want to go ahead and
kind of explain that I have a lot of
products in this video mainly because I
wanted to pick a product for each part
of the face and I'm not saying that a
beginner has to have all of these
products at once I'm just mentioning to
you my favorite things for each part of
the face so if you're a beginner you
know some of you might not want to go
buy all these products you can pick and
choose what product you want to try try
it out and then you can come back later
whenever you want to try something else
maybe for your eyes and see what I
recommend for that it's totally up to
you what you want to try out these are
just the products that I highly
recommend and think would be great for a
lot of people and most of them are very
very affordable this is actually all
drugstore and I swear by these products
I just think they are so amazing so
again like I said you can just pick and
choose what products you want to use or
if you want to start wearing makeup and
you want all this stuff by all means go
get it I have no problem against that
because I know when I started with
makeup I wanted everything now the first
thing I want to talk to you guys about
is primer and for different skin types
there's different primers for you and
that will suit you best
I have oily skin so I'm going to show
you the one I have for oily skin but I
will say most of the primers in the
drugstore I feel like are more towards
people with more dry skin because
everyone that I've tried literally has
made my face look like a shiny hot mess
other than this one I don't know I
haven't found another product from the
drugstore that really works great for
oily skin so if you do have oily skin
and you're starting out with makeup I
recommend this L'Oreal Revitalift
miracle blur this is an instant skin
smoother and it's oil-free now I'm not
going to tell you this is like my
all-time favorite primer because it's
not but this is a great primer from the
drugstore it is so so silky smooth and
makes your skin feel like butter I mean
it is stunning it does fill in the lines
very well I feel like if you have a kind
of smaller pores not as large as mine
this would really help minimize your
pores as well so I really do
get this one is the oil free you want to
make sure you get the oil free for if
you have oily skin and if you have dry
skin you can just get the one that
doesn't say oil free and that will
really work for your skin so I recommend
this one now for a foundation this is no
surprise to any of you it is the
covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundations I have two of them I love
this I have oily skin like insanely oily
skin and I love this people I've heard
with combo oily skin love it and I have
heard people with dry skin love it I
think it's kind of a hit and miss with
certain dry skin if you have dry skin I
would kind of just moisturize a little
bit more to make sure this doesn't cling
to your dry patches but you could also
try the L'Oreal True Match Lumi which is
really great for dry skin it personally
didn't work for me because it made me
look super shiny but if you have dry
skin I think you would really like it it
would kind of give you a really gorgeous
healthy glow but for the combo to oily
skin and some dry skin people this is
like my favorite it gives amazing
coverage it looks gorgeous on the skin I
mean this is hands-down my favorite
drugstore foundation and I've mentioned
it a lot and if you actually want to see
this in action I will leave my current
foundation routine down below and you
could check it out and this is I think
under ten dollars it's super affordable
and it has a pump which is amazing
beyond two powders they want I just
obsessed with is the Maybelline Dream
matte powder again this is for more oily
skin but if you have dry skin you can
try out the NYX setting powder is the
NYX not the set it off right they have
another one I'll put a picture of it
right here you can try that out because
I heard it works really great if you
have super dry skin you might not want a
powder so you could totally skip that
step if you feel like you don't need it
because there's no point in adding extra
product if you feel like your skin
doesn't really need it
but for my oily skin girls out there
this Maybelline Dream matte powder is oh
so good this is another product I would
compare to a high-end product because
literally is so fine you can't even see
it on your skin like it's so freakin
beautiful I can't stress it enough I
always have this with me at all times
because it's just amazing for on-the-go
and just setting your makeup so
I highly recommend this again biggest
ones under $10 as well it's really good
now for my girls who want some bronzer
this is by far the best bronzer I have
found in the drugstore is the NYC Sun
and bronze bronzing powder in Montauk
bronze so this is what it looks like it
is seriously so stunning it's very very
pigmented this is like two or three
dollars and it goes on the skin so
beautifully like you probably can't see
you can adjust self-tan but you can see
look at that I think it's a gorgeous
natural-looking bronzer it doesn't look
super Orange I love it again it's like
two or three dollars you can't beat it
it's so amazing and I just highly
recommend it if you have trying to sound
let me know what you think of it in the
comments below now for my girls who love
blush and just want to skip a blush I
have two different options the one
that's a little bit more expensive is
the Milani baked blush I think these are
probably like five six seven dollars I
can't remember I'm a bought one in a
long time but this one is luminoso and
this one is like a color that can pretty
much go with any look that you do it
gives you a gorgeous glow and it's kind
of like a peachy it's just yeah it's
like a peachy blush but it is so
stunning on the skin the quality of
these Milani blushes is amazing I'm
going to go for something more like a
couple dollars you cannot go wrong with
wet and wild
I know wet and wild doesn't look like
the bee's knees in the drugstore with
the packaging but the product on the
inside is amazing this is my favorite
blush from them is called pearlescent
pink and I've had two of these this is
my most recent one I know if you're a
beginner it's kind of hard to tell how
much you need but with this blush you
just barely need to touch it so be very
careful with your brush you just kind of
want to tap it in there tap off any
excess you might have on the brush and
then just apply to the apples of your
cheeks and you will be good to go this
is amazing
again comparable to any high-end blush I
would say tart because the pigmentation
and how long it lasts on your skin is
just so good so again if you didn't want
to spend those six dollars or so on this
and
one just been more like three I would
definitely recommend this one but both
of these are amazing
next thing is concealer by far this is
the best concealer I have tried from the
drugstore it is from Jane cosmetics you
can get Jane at Ulta I don't know about
anywhere else I think it's only Ulta but
seriously this is like the best coverage
for a drugstore concealer I compare this
to my Mac Pro Longwear so if you don't
want to buy the Mac Pro Longwear which
most beginners don't want to definitely
give this to try it does not crease as
long as you set it with powder and it
lasts all day and it's seriously full
coverage is so stunning you can get this
in a lighter shade if you want to do
like a little bit of a highlight
underneath your eyes or just get the
concealer the same color as your face
put it underneath your eyes just for a
really natural look it's beautiful and
it's under $10 which is amazing for
brows I feel like brows is a really
important part just because your brows
can really make a look this is something
you might want to try later on down the
road when you're doing when you're
beginning with makeup but if you want to
go ahead and try it out this is a
product that I would recommend
it's the Milani at brow fix kit now I
took out all the little fun stuff it
came with but I'll put a picture of it
it came with some little tools here on
the side but I have the color medium and
it comes with three different shades you
have two different brow shape and then
you have a highlight that you can use
underneath your brow so this is awesome
you can also use this as an eyeshadow
palette if you wanted to kind of double
it up as something else this is great
for your brows it looks really natural
and if you just apply it with a little
angle brush that comes in here because I
used to have it use it all the time and
the angle brush is amazing definitely
keep that in the thing the brush is so
soft it just blends that brow powder
right into your brows and it looks so
natural highly recommend it if you're
wanting to do your brows this is
definitely the kit that I would
now for prime work for me that's a hard
one to kind of just sit here and
recommend to you guys one thing you can
do is take your concealer and put just a
little bit over your lid you don't want
to do too much because it might crease
on you but you can just put a little bit
on your lid and that could be your eye
primer that's the one that I would
highly recommend but if you want to try
different eye primers wet-and-wild has
one L'Oreal has one I know a bunch of
different people have I prime errs that
you can try out but if you just want to
save the money definitely just take your
concealer and put a little bit over your
eyelids it'll cancel out any redness or
discoloration and it will give you a
really nice space for any of the shadows
that you want to put on now for eye
shadows I have one brand that I'm
obsessed with and love and I just can't
get enough of these eyeshadows because
obviously I have quite a few quads these
are the Maybelline eye studio quads I
have a few some of them are limited
edition and one of my favorites is this
one this is in the permanent collection
it's called coral Oasis and you just
have four different shades these are so
beautiful
very pigmented and they actually blend
very very very well so I mean you cannot
go wrong with these they are stunning
shades and if you guys still find the
limited edition little palettes in store
I would recommend a beginner to try out
this one called fall temptation you do
have a matte dark brown in here and then
you have some other neutral shades that
you can go to again they're really
pigmented blend beautifully again
another brand is wet and wild you could
try them out I feel like the Maybelline
ones just lasts longer than wet wild on
my eyes personally but some people could
be totally different so try out whatever
you prefer when wild is cheaper if you
do want to give that a go I really
quickly want to talk about liners
Jordana is by far my favorite for
drugstore eyeliners I have the Jordana
fabula inner which is currently sealed
up because I haven't been able to use
again I still have another one that I'm
using I've been using for a few months
now and this is amazing the felt tip on
it is so gorgeous I think felt tip is
more of the way to go when you're a
beginner just because you have more
control other than a brush in for a
stick Meyer if you want one this
Jourdain a twelve-hour made to last
liquid eyeliner this is awesome as well
super creamy last on your waterline
and it just looks so beautiful I mean
let me tell you this stuff is black and
I barely touched my skin it's really
really really good and also these two
liners from Jordana are super affordable
I think they're just like a couple
dollars maybe two or three dollars a
piece
so I mean by far hands down I recommend
these for any makeup again oh we're
almost done so going on to mascara the
one that I recommend is the Maybelline
rocket mascara I haven't talked about
this in a while but it's still one of my
favorite mascaras from the drugstore
just because I think it gives a ton of
volume now if you don't want a ton of
volume and want to go more for
lengthening I would definitely recommend
the L'Oreal telescopic shocking
extensions or the regular L'Oreal
telescopic because those aren't super
super dramatic unless you really build
it up it'll give you more of that
natural look but if you want more
dramatic lashes this is the way to go it
kind of just depends on you know as a
beginner what you want your lashes to
look like you want to look a little bit
more full and thick or do you want to
look a little bit more natural which the
L'Oreal telescopic can do so it's just
up to you but I love this one even
though full warning you it is a pain to
take off make sure you try to take it
off a waterproof eye makeup remover
because otherwise this baby isn't going
anywhere now if you want to be a
lipstick kind of girl then I just have a
new that I want to show you guys in a
pink so the pink I recommend is this one
from Rimmel and it's called pink pink
cheek it's not too pink on the lips it
just looks like you have a wash of color
on there and it just looks really
gorgeous now if you want to go with more
of a nude this is the perfect nude
because it's not too new it's literally
the most beautiful color ever whenever
you have a nude lipstick you really
don't want to look washed out because
it's just going to look so unnatural and
not flattering at all a super washed out
lip doesn't look good but if you want
something that is a nude not too
noticeable this is the way to go wet and
wild
Fergie lipstick in for you daily it's
very good now if you want to either top
the lipsticks or just have a regular
gloss you can't go wrong with these
these are the NYX butter glosses I've
talked about these a lot favorite colors
are creme
language is more of a nude and then
apple strudel which is kind of a peach
and these are amazing they make your
lips look so gorgeous and just glossy
and they feel so good on the lips are
not sticky at all they do have pretty
great pigmentation so if you're wanting
a really awesome gloss that's not sticky
at all then you want to try out these
because they are amazing
