March favorites and I have quite a bit
of new things to show you guys I've
really been loving but it is Mac I do
have quite a bit of Mac products in here
but I did go shopping at the beginning
of the month at Mac which is why I've
been trying out these new things I've
seen so many people talk about them and
I've literally been obsessed with them
but it did have some other products in
here that I'm excited to show you guys
and if you hear Colton he's being
awfully loud because he's playing call
of duty boys so the first thing that I
purchased is this Mac Pro conceal and
correct palette this is a medium and I
absolutely love this palette
it just has six different shades in here
I mix these two it's great I can sealing
like acne or Venus me up redness around
your nose it's great at that and I love
it I just wanted to pick up this palette
because I figured I can mix and match
colors you know because summer is coming
and going go to the pool and things like
that but I love this little palette it
comes in such great handy next this is a
Mac matte eye skin finish in a soft and
gentle who does not know about this
little guy and love it I mean oh my gosh
I just finally had to pick it up because
I have been craving it for so long and
that's what it looks like right there so
the next thing is this blush from Mac
this is called alpine bronze and I
talked about this a couple times on my
channel but I absolutely love it it just
makes your skin look so nice and bronzed
and I'm wearing it today with my contour
and I just I love it it just looks
really beautiful on the skin the next
Mac product is something I have seen so
many people talk about and I was like oh
I gotta go get my hands on that and it
is the Mac prep and prime in light boost
now I do have radiant rose I haven't
really tried
yet but I actually really love like
boots underneath the eyes I don't think
it really accentuates anything wrong
with my eyes I don't I don't think so
but I'm gonna try radiates Rose I was
having that round to it because I've
been loving like boost so it's just like
a little pin thing and you roll this up
I've used it in a couple of my videos I
actually use it my last get ready with
me so I'll put that down below if you
want to see it in action but it's pretty
awesome it lines underneath your eyes
and it's just beautiful so again the
neck prep and prime it might boost and
then for concealer I began heard nothing
but great things about this especially
underneath the eyes and then it doesn't
crease and it really doesn't the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer and c20 now I did
usually when I go to Mac I'm like it NW
so the first one I purchased actually
purchased this online and this is in
nw15 but it turned out to be way too
like I don't know if you can see the
difference so I went to Mac and she
suggested this one for me so I figured
I'd keep this one if I need to make some
a scary thing but NC 20 has been my
color it does have a pump it's kind of
messy but I love this concealer it
covers so well and it really just looks
amazing underneath eyes especially with
the prep and prime highlighter and then
the last Mac product is this Mac brushes
of the Mac 109 and I'm obsessed with
this brush is so amazing at blending out
your contour and just really bronzing up
the skin it's just gorgeous
I know these are like expensive brushes
and I was sitting there and I was
talking to a girl and I was like okay is
it really good brush because it feels
really good and it has a great shape to
it but you know it's like $32 so I
didn't want to spend it and hate it she
was like we were actually just talking
about that today about how amazing this
brush is how it blends out beautifully
so I was like oh you sucked me into it
so I've on it love it I want to get a
couple more brushes from that just to
try it out because I like to try
different things and I've only tried
Sigma brushes so don't
and drugstores so like Mac and
higher-end brushes I haven't really
tried but so far loving it this does
shed but it doesn't shed portly but it
has a great shape to it and I'm just I'm
in love with it it's great okay moving
on I have I start with this I have the
Naked basics palette such a gorgeous
palette when urban decay first came out
this palette I personally didn't think
it'd be anything special but I'm
obsessed with this perfect for an
everyday look it has mostly matte shades
other than one which is Venus and I've
used this in a video as well I'll link
it down below if you want to see it it's
like a full face in under ten minutes if
you kind of don't want to buy the Naked
palette or they make it to palette this
is definitely the way to go
it's $27 compared to the Naked palette
and then they get to which are 50 apiece
so if you just kind of want to try out
Urban Decay then I recommend this one
also if you if you're a Mutual's girl
this is the palette to go to next you
guys know I love my Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer but if also been loving
this one again I just love it so much in
the past but I've just been reaching for
it more lately and it's the hoola
benefit bronzer when I first saw this I
was like how is that gonna bronze my
skin that's like if not even a dark
bronzer at all but it really does it
looks gorgeous limb skin and I do have
it on today it's just beautiful and it's
a matte bronzer which is great and these
little guys last forever okay the next
thing I just want to quickly shout out
I've really been loving this mascara is
the boreal shocking extensions mascara I
did do a video on this and I absolutely
loved it
it's just perfect mascara I have not
mixed or matched any mascaras lately
this has been the only one I've been
using and I really love it so this is my
favorite mascara also I want to talk
about this Rimmel pencil and I know a
bunch of people like to use the NYX
jumbo eye pencil in milk but it's still
white I kind of feel
it looks very unnatural on the water
line sometimes it can be just a little
too much so I found this pencil this is
from rimmel and it's the scandaleyes
waterproof Kohl liner in nude and so it
looks like I need to sharpen mine of
course but it's just a new liner and it
just looked so awesome on your waterline
it looks very natural and it just
brightens up your eyes without looking
like you have something on your
waterline if that makes any sense but
this is gorgeous again it's from Rimmel
and it's the skin wise coal liner and
nude I also just want to quickly shout
out my brow fix kit from Milani I've
been using the brow 2 in here like crazy
I just love the fact that you can mix
and match your brow colors so if you're
a beginner this is definitely a palette
to go to mine is in medium and I do keep
the little brush that it came with
because I think it's really nice next
isn't I shadow base from Sigma and this
is called persuade I think I mentioned
this last month but I can't remember it
reminds me so much of painterly from Mac
I mean it's beautiful
and I really really like this it keeps
my eyeshadows on all day ok next is the
lipliner this is from Stila it's the
feel alone where lipliner actually got
this off of hook look and this is in the
color aspiring it's just a nude and it's
really pretty there's not much to say
about it other than it's a gorgeous
liner and I think it's awesome and I got
it for probably nine dollars can't
really remember but that's a really like
lip liner and then I also want to shout
out my resort palette from Sigma love
this actually love picking soft and
gentle all over my lid
and then I'd go in this is my favorite
color and it's called topaz oh
absolutely love the color topaz I think
it's beautiful and then another favorite
in this palette is definitely the duo
eyeliner I have the brown on today and I
really like it and I did a video with
the blue liner and I'll put that down
below if you're interested but out of
this whole palette topaz is my all-time
favorite color I think it's perfect for
summer just gives that really nice kind
of bronze die okay moving on to more
body stuff I have two perfumes this one
I've been obsessed with like literally I
can't get enough of it this wonderstruck
from Taylor Swift
oh oh my god I really can't get enough
of it I have been eyeing this for months
but I did want to buy it and I saw it
Marshalls for $25 I thought it was the
big bottle and I opened the buck the box
up and it was like this tiny ass bottle
but it's okay because I'm I mean I'm
loving it and if you kind of like girly
kind of fruity since you would love this
so I would test it out before you buy it
and then for like a more sophisticated
really mature scent I love my Jimmy -
Jimmy Choo perfume this is what I got
for Christmas because I actually used up
all my Viva La Juicy which is like a
holy grail for me but I got this one for
Christmas and it smells so good can't
get enough of it so this Jimmy Choo
perfume is on point as well so these are
my two favorite just depending on my
mood I'll just switch him out doing
things I have a face tanner
I really have to shout out this face
Tanner for a million dollar tan it's the
Cabana tan face extreme moisturizing
dark sunless tanning lotion strictly for
your face now when I'm use my thumb god
Tanner I never ever ever put that on my
face just because I feel like it's gonna
break me out really bad and if I do like
a spray tan I'm washing my face
exfoliating and everything like that so
the color ends up going off anyways but
this is great I use it part about every
other every two days I'd say and then
just reapply it make sure I wash my
hands right after I apply it and this
makes you look normal because I like to
go out without makeup a lot of the time
so now I am matching and I'll have a tan
face and a tan neck so I really love
this stuff and this is what it looks
like it's just a really cute little
bottle so and then the last thing is
something I actually finished up today
this is the batiste dry shampoo hint of
dark color her hint of color dark and
deep brown this is amazing it makes my
hair so refreshed like my hair was so
oily the other day and I was like oh I'm
running late I really don't have time to
wash my hair and I just sprayed this all
over let it soak in rubbed it and then
kind of wait a couple more minutes and
then brushed it out and it looked so
fresh and I just I freaking love it so I
definitely recommend this especially if
you have dark hair it's amazing I love
it so that is it for my March favorites
guys I hope you enjoyed it don't forget
