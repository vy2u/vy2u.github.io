my March favorites and I know this is a
little early but I figured I already
knew what I was loving so I wanted to go
ahead and show you guys all the fun
products that I've been using this month
ok so the first one I want to mention is
this NARS lip gloss this is in the color
odalisque I believe this is from the
larger-than-life lip gloss collection
I'm obsessed with this it's just a
really gorgeous kind of peachy orange
color and I'm loving this shade and it
is so beautiful the only thing I don't
like about these lip glosses are the
brush tips at the end because as you can
see they're super super tiny but I love
the color so much in the formula that I
don't even care they're not sticky or
anything like that you've got to check
this out it's beautiful
another NARS product I want to mention
is this radiant creamy concealer I'm in
the color medium one custard and I have
heard so many things about this
concealer and let's be real I was kind
of nervous to try it out because I was
like usually when I hear creamy I think
of something that's a little bit more
sheer where I like stuff like the mac
prolongwear that's super intense high
coverage but yet not cakey this is
freaking awesome this is very high
coverage it's not heavy at all it does
kind of crease into your fine lines but
it's not that bad I mean I've definitely
had worse I got this like just last
weekend so this is definitely a recent
favorite but oh it is so good I had to
mention it in this video next I'm going
to talk about a primer I've been using
this is the bare minerals prime time a
BB primer cream and medium basically
it's like a tinted primer and it does
have an SPF of 30 so this is what it
looks like it makes my skin feel super
smooth and also kind of camouflage just
some of the redness that I have on my
face so I'm gonna go to apply foundation
I don't have to apply like a ton of
product right here around my cheeks so I
really love that about this and it's
been really great with my oily skin
hasn't made me any greasy err
to take pictures though I would
definitely not use this since it does
have SPF 30 it could cause a white cast
but you can even wear this alone and be
good to go it's it's freakin good I love
it
next up I want to mention a highlighter
this is a Mac mineralized skinfinish
highlighter in a perfect topping and
this is what it looks like I'm angling
it down so you can kind of see the true
color I love this I've actually been
using it for a couple months now and it
is by far one of my favorite
highlighters ever you can see right
there it just creates a really nice
sheen on your skin and I got this from a
collection about a couple months ago I
can't remember I think it was the
magnetic nude collection but it could be
wrong because I can't remember I've been
so into highlighters and trying new ones
and ever since I got this one I just
can't keep my hands off of it so if I'm
able to find this online I will
definitely like it for you guys down
below but if not and this comes back in
like a different collection you should
definitely try it out next I want to
talk about two blush washes next I'm
gonna talk about two blushes from
Maybelline these are named master
highlights highlighting blushes and I'm
obsessed this first color is in coral
that's pretty true to color right there
I like this a lot it gives you like a
light coral shade to your cheeks but it
also has that gorgeous highlighting
Sheen so it just makes you look like
you're glowing and especially with the
coral it is just stunning so I love this
shade this one is my favorite though
this is in the color deep bronze and oh
this is me and a blush love it it's just
a nice kind of copper toned blush i I
love this and when I find with these two
highlighting blushes is they're not
really shimmery or anything like that
they just have that gorgeous Sheen to
them to give you that glow so this is
the deep bronze you can see right there
it just gives a nice glow I want to talk
about face powders I've been loving the
first one is actually being discontinued
this is the Maybelline Dream matte
powder if you can find this in your
drugstores I would definitely recommend
it checking it out but that's what it
looks like I have the color medium or I
have the color beige medium 22.5 I love
this powder so much because it is such a
finely milled powder so it's not gonna
look
and it really gives you an airbrushed
kind of flawless finish but this other
powder is available now this is a newer
one this is the L'Oreal True Match
mineral powder I have the color of buff
beige that's what the packaging looks
like this again is a nice finely milled
powder but this does claim 16 hours of
fresh true color well break through I
don't agree with that I think this is a
great powder to set your makeup with
because it adds a little bit of coverage
and it doesn't look cakey at all but for
me I'm so early it's insane this does
not keep my oils from coming through
this one definitely has a better lasting
power but this one is just great to set
your makeup with okay next up I have
some more products from Maybelline I
actually have quite a bit of stuff for
Maybelline in this video just because
I've been really loving that brand so I
have these Maybelline Color elixirs that
I purchased at the beginning of this
month and the colors I have our nude
illusion which is this nude one and then
petal plush I love these glosses they're
not super pigmented they do have a good
color payoff though I love the formula
everything about them is just amazing
they feel so creamy on your lips they're
not sticky at all and for me they do
last quite a long time so I also adore
the doe foot applicator on this because
I just love the way it feels on my lips
is that weird but I love this nude one
especially if I'm wearing a like a nude
lipstick that's just a little too nude
for me I can talk that lipstick off with
this color and it will look nice and put
together and very wearable
okay last thing from Maybelline is this
eye studio quad and copper sheet I did
do a makeup tutorial with this then only
down below and also with curl oasis
which is another one of my favorite
palettes this is beautiful though I feel
like this will look absolutely stunning
on everybody no matter what skin tone oh
I think you will love this by far my
favorite I've been using it a lot this
month I've been doing kind of smoky your
eyes I'll do a light eye with this three
more thick three more things I will show
you three are things that I want to show
you guys this is the first a beauty skin
rescue purifying mask with red clay I
love pretty much everything from this
line from first day Beauty because it's
just
quickly for sensitive oily skin
personally when I'm washing my face at
night I get a little bit annoyed at all
of the water that I see around my sink
and on my floor just because I can never
seem to get it all back into the seat
when I want to apply a mask half the
time I don't want to have to wash it off
because I don't want to clean up the
water wait for the mess to dry and then
get water everywhere again from washing
it off so this is a peel-off mask I will
just end up using this and I do apply
not a thick layer but a pretty decent
amount to my cheeks just so it's thick
enough that I could peel it off
completely with like one go instead of
sitting there picking different pieces
off it minimizes my pores it makes my
skin feel super smooth and it clears up
my skin as well and if you're wondering
it is a red mask so that's what it looks
like it's a little intimidating to some
people but if it works for your skin it
doesn't even matter now I did make a
bigger purchase I think a month and a
month and a half ago I did buy a Louie
Vuitton purse but for the nights that I
go out I don't want to bring like my
nice purse like to a bar or something
because that's just not right so I
decided to purchase this little guy this
is a toy bar Eva clutch I believe and it
just has the gold strap and this has
been amazing I'm not usually a clutch
kind of person but this is freaking huge
and I'm obsessed with it I can fit my
full wallet in here tons of makeup
products and stuff down here it's so
cute I love the fact that it's super
simple I love the gold hardware they do
have silver hardware as well you could
even take the strap off and just use it
as like a plain old clutch but I like to
have the strap on it because I like the
chain so if you want to check this out I
will leave a link down below it is a
little bit pricey I will say that but it
is really great quality - like the fact
that mine's a little dirty over here it
is really really great quality I have
one more pride I quickly want to show
you guys because my camera shine this is
from lush I forget what it's called but
I'll leave it like right here oh I love
this stuff you guys if you have like
really really dry legs I was suffering
from super dry itchy legs throughout
this month and this has saved my life so
much I heard
you burn and so I love talking about it
so I decided to go get it and it's
amazing it doesn't smell like super
great but I have smelt worse from lush
okay so that is it for this favorites
