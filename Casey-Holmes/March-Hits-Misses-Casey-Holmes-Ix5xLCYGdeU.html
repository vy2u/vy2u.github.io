my March hits and misses I did a
February hits and misses last month and
you guys seem to really like it I do
have a couple products this month that
I'm just not feeling and don't really
like so I figured I would share them
with you but first I definitely wanted
to share all of my favorite products
with you guys and things that I feel
like you should go run out and buy
immediately there's a lot of face
products in this one because I've been
trying a lot of face products lately and
there's not really any eyeshadows that
I've wanted to try so lots of face
products and then a couple skincare
items and attender you requested in my
last hits and misses that I would put my
music favorites in the next one because
I usually put them in my favorites
videos in these hits and misses videos
are basically my favorites videos I'm
just calling them something different
and I'm definitely going to include my
music favorites at the end of this one
because I have a lot of songs to share
with you guys and a lot of you're mad at
me that I have not done song favorites
in a while so I've got you that is what
we're going to do today the first thing
I want to start off with is skincare and
I have been loving these this is really
busted this is the dr. jart poor master
patch and I really like this because it
has the poor strip that you put on your
nose but then it also comes with like a
moisturizing one with it what I call it
they call it the moist patch so after
you do the dry patch and you peel off
all those blackheads and gunk in your
nose you could put the moist patch on
top and it really just like calms the
skin down tightens the pores back up and
you're good to go and I love it this is
kind of a long process you have to leave
the first patch on for 10 minutes and
then the moist patch on for 10 minutes
as well so it's a 20-minute ordeal but
at one point after I came back from
vacation and my face stop peeling my
nose was so dark and it was gross I was
sitting here doing my makeup one day and
I looked and I was like oh that's
disgusting I was like I need a facial I
don't have time so what am I gonna do
and I forgot I had purchased a couple of
these so I did use one on my nose and it
pulled out so much gunk it was nasty
but honestly it made my nose look so
much better and I was like thank God
thank God I had these four strips
because I had used one of these before
like a couple months ago but I
forgot I had purchased another one
because I really like that one and I
will keep repurchasing these because it
does the job and it also really calms my
nose down after I do the first strip so
I really like these I highly recommend
them so the next thing I actually have
two of these and the one that I use all
the time is in my shower I like to
personally use it on the days that I
wash my hair so I can put the mask on
while I'm in the shower
but it's the Boscia charcoal poor
pudding and basically it says that it's
a two-part pour pudding powered by black
and white charcoal and they work
together to minimize the appearance of
pores while balancing skin for ideal
results and I really feel like this
tightens my pores I can feel it working
it has like a little burning tingling
sensation to it and after I rinse my
face off and get out of the shower I can
really feel a difference in my skin and
I feel like my skin looks a lot better
when I use this like once a week when I
wash my hair so it's really cool it just
looks like this it's black and white and
it also comes with a little spoon so
when you take the lid off it looks like
this you want to make sure you get a
little bit of the white and the black
charcoal and then mix it together and
it'll obviously turn gray and then you
just put all of your skin and wait for
about 10 to 15 minutes and then you can
wash it off and like I said I like to do
this in the shower right after I use the
cleanser and then I'll wash it off and
get out of the shower and it's just it's
awesome I really really like it I think
this is what my pores need because I
have oily skin and larger pores so my
problematic areas are right here but I
feel like my skin has been looking a lot
better since I started using this okay
let's move on to face products I have
highlighters let's talk about
highlighters
so the first highlight and kit I want to
talk about well the only highlighting
kit in this video is the Anastasio glow
kit and this is the that glow palette I
think that's what it's called but it has
more golden colors in it so this is what
it looks like my favorite color that
I've been using non-stop is dripping and
gold I think it is stunning when I first
got this palette I thought the shades
are going to be a little too dark but
they're not at all they are absolutely
stunning and I love them this one is a
little too bronzy and dark for me but it
can be used as like a blush topper or
something that's this one right here
you just see how beautiful they are and
they're really creamy and smooth and I
just love them I love the fact that you
get four highlighters in one so honestly
if you didn't want to go out and buy
numerous highlighters I would just buy
this kit and you can mix and match you
can do whatever you want and have a
different highlighter for almost every
day the other highlighter that I
completely wore out in Punta Cana was
this Charlotte Tilbury bar of gold guys
I'm wearing this today can you see that
none of you can see it using that this
highlighter is beautiful I love it this
has got to be one of my top favorite
highlighters ever it is really small for
the price but I said that's so weird it
is pretty tiny for the price but I feel
like a get quite a bit of product
because it's like a bow lock of gold
it's just the packaging is really tiny
which is actually pretty good for
traveling but it is so cute it's so
pretty
I know some people have had an issue
with this um breaking on them when they
first order it but I didn't have that
issue I absolutely loved it I travelled
with it I didn't pack it like really
great or anything I just threw it with
all my makeup and it did really well
throughout traveling but that's it right
there
a little bit goes a long way with this
product like it is intense but it is
just so beautiful I have it underneath
my brow bone as well I just I just love
this highlighter I mean I don't know
which one I think this one might be my
favorite over the Anastacio cloak it
just because it's so beautiful and it's
creamy and it blends so well it's just
so pretty
okay the next in the last highlighter is
new from Urban Decay I use this in my
last get ready with me like full glam
video and the color was kind of off in
that video so hopefully this video is
not off it looks a little my hair looks
a little green so I'm gonna have to kind
of change up the color when I edit this
but this is a gorgeous highlighter and I
don't think that video did it any
justice but it is the afterglow
eight-hour powder highlighter instan
they got three different ones that this
one is my favorite it's more of that
champagne kind of highlight which are my
favorites I don't really like pinky
highlights or anything like
that you can just see how beautiful it
is
that's it even has like a little hint of
gold in it but it is just so beautiful I
mean these highlighters have been
everything this March for me I have
loved them so much but if I had to
recommend one just one for you to go by
it would probably be the Charlotte
Tilbury one just because it is gorgeous
but if you don't like gold highlighters
you will not like this at all so I
believe I talked about this foundation
last month but if I did I love it it's
the soap and glory one heck of a blot
foundation I'm gonna do my first
impressions update this weekend I'm
going to film it it will probably be up
either Sunday or sometime next week but
I love this such a great foundation it
minimizes the look of your pores like no
other is flawless
I used this when I was at the beach and
it was perfect it lasted so long and I
just loved it so you can get this at
Ulta I got mine on Ulta calm I don't
know about in stores I haven't been in
stores of an Ulta in a while these right
here are where it's at if your oily have
larger pores I think you would
absolutely love this foundation also a
favorite primer that I've worked into my
primer routine is this one heck of a
blunt instant perfecting powder primer
it's a shine block 12-hour pore shrink
technology I completely agree with that
I think this minimizes look at my pores
with any foundation and it does help
keep me matte but it's not overly drying
it is the perfect primer foil II skin in
my personal opinion I just think it does
what it needs to do because some of the
ones that I've tried really dry your
skin out and sometimes they'll get flaky
even on my really oily areas where I
need that you know primer to mattify it
will kind of ball up and just look
really gross this does not do that it is
so great I just rub it through my
fingers and then rub it on my skin
mainly in my t-zone and then I wait for
just a couple minutes and then I'll
apply my foundation and it's good to go
also when I was on vacation I got a tan
I got burned I was a hot mess and I did
not have a foundation color to hook
myself up with but luckily I did bring
my NYX pro foundation mixer whenever I
get really burned or
like a really dark natural tan I will be
a little bit more on the warm side
sometimes all of it just kind of depends
it looks kind of scary in the tube
because you're like wow that's like an
orange color I don't want to be orange
and the same goes for when you actually
squeeze it out in your foundation you're
just kind of like oh my god that is
that's orange but I promise you once you
mix it into your foundation it just
warms it up perfectly I used it today
with my Smashbox Studios skin 15-hour
we're hydrating foundation which by the
way I'm loving this right now but I
mixed it and with that just to give me
more of a warm color because I still
have a little bit of that natural tan
and this is perfect it doesn't like
alter the consistency of the foundation
it doesn't alter the things that the
foundation does it just helps with the
color so love this I still need to buy
the white one to lighten up foundations
but I have been trying and it's been
sold out so many times on all TOCOM so
max keep checking so I want to quickly
shout out this NYX HD finishing powder
this and the translucent one are perfect
this one is in the shade banana I'll use
this to set my under eye and I love it
it's such a finely milled powder and it
just looks flawless underneath the eyes
I have nothing bad to say about this and
the translucent one is somewhere in my
clutches because I take it out with me a
lot and the packaging is great it's nice
and slim so thumbs up for that one a
couple blushes I've been loving the
first one is this Shea Moisture blush in
peach coral and it just looks like this
it's a really tiny blush but I love it
first off this is my kind of shade I
love peachy coral colors especially for
spring and summer and when I was on
vacation this was my go to blood could
be a little bit chalky but I love it I
think it applies really beautifully and
it blends out really well as well and it
does last for a really long time so I
love it it is pretty small I can't quite
remember how much it was I think it was
like around drugstore prices online okay
and then the other blush I have been
loving is this benefit Dallas blush I
have this on today I don't know if you
guys can tell just a nice kind of bronzy
everyday blush if you like more of those
warm toned blushes I think you would
really like this it just gives like a
nice subtle Sheen to your
skin and it really just warms up the
complexion and I personally love that
especially with like the bronze are
wearing today I know I'm like super late
on the bandwagon for this one I remember
like three years ago people used to talk
about this all the time and I finally
just dipped into it and I'm like where
have I been this is perfect so kind of
like Noor's madly where when you look at
it you're like oh I don't know but when
you put it on your skin it's just
beautiful it even has like a little hint
of mauve stunning and then just a couple
more things this bronzer is everything
this is the urban decay beached bronzer
and bronze this is one of their newer
bronzers and it's a really really warm
bronzer I have it on my face right now
and I love it and it's definitely more
on the warm side but it's not too warm
where it looks orange it's just a nice
warm natural rahzar it literally looks
like you just went to the beach and got
a serious tan it's so finely milled that
like when you apply it it looks so
smooth and airbrushed and I just I love
it I have nothing bad to say about it
and I also adore the packaging on this
okay now I just want to quickly shout
out this lip color this is a Laura
highly pigmented lipstick and
exhibitionist and there's something
about this lip color I love it I'm
wearing it right now on my lips it's a
matte lip color but it's not drying
whatsoever it's like a creamy matte okay
let's move on to the misses and then we
will get onto music favorites and
that'll be it for this video
so the first miss I want to talk about
is this foundation I tried it in one of
my first impressions videos and I loved
it in that video this is why I have to
do updates on these videos because I do
love this foundation I love the
consistency I love the way it applies I
love the way it looks it just looks so
flawless but Punta Cana was so humid and
it was really hot this did not hold up
on my oily skin at all
I was so oily in like a matter of
minutes with this foundation and it just
looked really bad on my skin and it was
not my favorite maybe if you have more
dry combo skin you would like this but
if you are really oily like me you might
not want to try this out unless you like
more of a dewy look and you don't mind
blotting your skin throughout the day
fortunately this didn't work for me I'm
not going to get rid of it though
because I would love to use this in the
wintertime like more in the cold months
I think this would be perfect for my
skin at that time but with summer and
humidity and it's Georgia honey I can't
wear this and then this thing I actually
tried out today it's what I have all my
eyes right now and I know like right now
on camera it actually looks really good
but I feel like I had higher hopes for
this product and I'm just kind of like
disappointed it's not crappy at all let
me just tell you so it's the Anastasia
eyeshadows now this is my first day
using it and you can see how like a
messy my palette is already I don't know
how I did that there is quite a bit of
fall out with these shadows which fall
really doesn't bother me as long as the
eyeshadows are good I could really care
less it has a lot of Fallout I wanted a
little palette like this so I could just
throw it into my bag if I'm traveling
because I've been traveling a lot lately
and I'm going to this summer as well and
I wanted a staple palette like this I
customized and these were all the shades
that I wanted a matte creamy matte
transition a dark outer V and then
something to kind of pop this is what I
have all over my lid and I'll just say
this color when I applied it on my lid
without fix plus I had to like I packed
this eyeshadow on I had to pile it and
pile it on and then when I sprayed my
brush with the fix plus and put it in
here it worked a lot better but I don't
always have fix plus with me you know
what I'm saying so I was disappointed in
that I feel like I could use a makeup
geek eyeshadow and get a better result
this one right here is also another kind
of one I feel like when you swatch it
it's really nice but it's a little
chalky and it's just not it's just not
one of my favorites unfortunately you
can't even see it because it's just a
really light transition color I thought
it was gonna be a little bit darker what
are you gonna do
just not one my favorite so I'm kind of
bummed out with these i'm stas eeeh
eyeshadows the only ones I'm not bummed
out with are these two because this one
is super dark it's what I have to kind
of do a cut crease and then this vanilla
shade is really nice as well I think
it's great for all over the lid but I
think that there are better eyeshadows
out there and I really expected these to
be like makeup forever call
the D and I personally don't think they
are so really bummed about that I'm
probably gonna have people like hate me
for it but you know just being honest
okay so let's talk about music favorites
this is my favorite part I know I
haven't done them in like months it's
been so long I remember the last time I
did one for a couple months there there
was like no good music and I was just I
couldn't incorporate any music into my
favorites because it was just like there
was nothing I was listening the same
stuff over and over again and finally I
got me some good music first song I want
to talk about that I love you guys know
if you've been watching my favorites
videos for a while now you know I love
Ariana Grande if when she comes up with
a new song more than likely she's going
to be in my favorites videos because
I've been listening to it non-stop and
that's exactly what I've been doing with
her newest single which is dangerous
woman guys
and another one I've been listening to
is called drink you away by Justin
Timberlake and this this is my song oh
my god I love this song
um next one is t-shirt by Thomas Rhett
soccer I love Thomas Rhett and I love

also have been loving a little bit of
you by chase Bryant
I don't want to be

song looking spanked get it honey

loving panda by designer
I want to say have you guys seen the
vine with the pandas playing and they're
playing this song and the pandas are
going down the slide it is so funny and
that's what I think of every time I hear
this songs

it's one hit I promise I don't know the
words this one either I sure could be a
