my monthly favorites and I already had
my makeup and hair done but I really
wanted to film a video so I figured I
would do my monthly favorites so it is a
little early but why not just go ahead
and do them these are my favorite videos
to film and my favorites to watch so I'm
going to jump into it because I've got a
lot of stuff this month and the first
thing I want to talk about is my hair
and first off also excuse my sunburn I
was at the pool way too long and I
didn't even realize it a bit like the
burn but first thing is my hair I
actually have my bellami hair extensions
in I've had these extensions in for my
past few videos I've been wearing them a
lot and I just love them actually only
have to like little tracks in and
they're just amazing what I love is
built though I like a little bit of link
to my hair but they add a lot more
volume so that's what I love I love the
fact that my hair down here is just as
thick as it is up top and i only have to
wear two extensions like two little
tracks to get that look so I love these
it gives me a lot of hair and I just I
love it so i will put the link down
below if you're interested in checking
them out also since we aren't talking
about my hair i have been using a new
curling wand this one is from New me and
if you've been following me for a while
now you know I love their curling irons
I use the curled ram that is the pink
zebra one I used 32 millimeter from that
all the time but this is actually the
curl jam set as well and I have a coupon
code for $115 off things like individual
wants or something down below but I love
this one the reason why I really love
this one is because it really makes my
hair nice and shiny and it just looks so
good and my curls of course lasts
forever with these wands like I used to
always have problems with my hair
curling and staying curled and I never
had a problem with any new me one so I
love it has like kind of a flat black
texture but it doesn't like catch on all
the colors and stuff like that and of
course it's really hot heats up fast and
it's just another product that I'm in
love
new me I literally just love their
curling wands that's like the number one
thing I recommend from them because I'm
always always impressed okay going on to
kind of skincare stuff I did just get
these items but they have been amazing
like I can't get enough of them so the
first thing is this bobby brown
hydrating eye cream and this is just
what it looks like it's just a little
eye cream and i love this i will never
go back to my dermalogica eye cream
because this i can feel the difference
underneath my eyes it's so moisturizing
and like all the little fine lines that
I had enemies here you can't even really
see them now because I just think that
area of my eyes was really dry and I
kind of didn't realize it and this has
helped so much it's so luxurious and I
just love the feeling of it I love the
feeling of putting concealer on top
because it makes my concealer apply
amazingly it looks so smooth never cakey
and I can't say enough good things about
it so i did get mine at nordstrom and
it's just amazing i would definitely
repurchase it again it is a very pricey
product but when it comes to skin care
sometimes you just you have to splurge
and then the next thing is this
philosophy total madness now if you are
oily like me really oily in the t-zone
nothing will help me half the time this
is the product to try out and I was also
for and I was actually looking for
something along the lines of you know a
little CRM to help oily skin and this
had like a five star review like from
everyone so I was like well why don't I
just try it I did order this from
nordstrom as well it came with like a
gift set from philosophy so go to
nordstrom and see if they still have it
because they'll give you that little
gift set if you purchase like thirty
dollars or more from philosophy but it
is a oil free mattifying pore eraser and
it is what it says it keeps you Matt but
it doesn't dry your skin out which I
really love and it does minimize the
look of your pores which if you have
oily skin more than likely you kind of
have a little bit of large of course as
well I know I do what can you do about
it but products like this
make it so much better and so much
easier to just feel more comfortable
with your skin and not have to really
belong as much and it's just it's heaven
so if you get the chance I definitely
recommend trying this product out and
that's what it looks like moving on to
makeup products the first thing I want
to talk about is I Xiao I've been using
and I've been obsessed with you so the
first one is this mac pigment in tan
this makes brown eyes pop you get a ton
of product for your money you're never
ever ever going to go through this I
don't think if you do you know it was
worth it but I recommend it especially
if you have brown eyes because it's
going to make your eyes pop like crazy
and then I've also been using my Urban
Decay Naked basics palette with it I've
been using the colors naked to faint and
crave so these three on the end with
this just to kind of smoke it out next
is an eyeliner and I've been loving the
drawer Dana sin my permanent liquid
liner you can get this at cherry culture
calm I show this in my hall a lot of
things are from my hall but because I'm
trying them out so this is a very
amazing long right eyeliner it literally
is only a couple dollars and sometimes I
have a problem with my wing getting a
little bit faded and just like not
holding out throughout the day this is
not going nowhere it really isn't until
you take it off it's not going off your
eyes so I highly recommend this it's
like two bucks it's totally worth it and
what I've been using with it is my mac
210 brush which is just a little
eyeliner brush and I'll just dip this
into a little jar and I'll put it on my
eyes and this is great because it's
really precise and it really flicks out
your winged eyeliner so I love this
brush I've been loving a lot of mac
brushes lately because i've just been
trying them out this is my favorite
eyeliner brush ever since we are
speaking about brushes i'm going to talk
about a couple the first one is this mac
212 brush I use this with a mac pigment
that I have and it I mean I've never
used a more amazing brush to apply a lid
especially for a pigment because I do
have some mac payments and i was using
different brushes and they just did not
apply well at all and they didn't apply
a lot of color this one applies so much
product on your lids it's amazing it's
super pigmented it makes any eyeshadow
look great on your lid and you don't
have to keep going over and over and
over your lid to really pack on the
shade so I love this you guys will be
seeing this pigment and a get ready with
me video I'm definitely going to do one
on it because I want to show you guys
how beautiful this color is so this 2 12
brush is amazing and then I also got
these brushes they're from crown brush
and it ordered them off of hautelook and
they charge us little duel into brushes
it came with some more but these are the
ones i've been using a lot lately so
this one's kind of like the blending duo
you have the larger blending brush and
then of course the pencil brush on the
end I've been loving using this one
underneath my lower lashes of course
using this one to kind of deep it up the
crease awesome and then I've been using
this one as well but mainly for this
side this is just a little brush and
it's really nice and pointy and this is
great to just get right underneath your
brow and highlight and also get in the
inner corners and just brighten up the
inner part of your eye next I want to
talk about my brow products I've been
using the first thing is my honest asya
a brow what is this perfect brow pencil
in dark brown and I really like this one
it just has the pencil on the in and of
course a spoolie which always comes in
handy so I love this just to kind of
sharpen up my brows and then I've been
using this which I got off of hautelook
as well it's the tart emphasize
waterproof Amazonian clay brow mousse
and I will be doing like a heatproof
makeup look and this will definitely be
included because it's waterproof
brownies you can't get any better than
that but it did come with this dual
brush so it has the brush on the end and
the spoolie it's amazing i love these
types of brushes it makes it so
convenient to do your brows and i got
the color medium brown and what i like
to do is take the brush and I'll dip it
in here but I also tap it on the lid to
get any excess off just
I don't put too much product on my brows
because you can accidentally like apply
way too much with this product so just
use a light hand with it and just kind
of go in lightly and then just build up
the color but this is so good it last
for forever until literally wash makeup
off moving on to one of my favorite
topics which is blush so I have three I
want to mention for this month first one
is tart now I actually recommend any
tart blush because these last forever
it's the Tarte Amazonian clay blushes
they're amazing like seriously they're
so pigmented so beautiful and they're
really soft and velvety as well no I
feel like the 12-hour claim is kind of
pushing it but these dudes last for
quite a few hours without having to
touch up and this one is in tipsy which
is kind of like a coral orange color
great for summer go look amazing with
the tan I just love it and if you're
wondering I tried to fill this before
but that tipsy is right there so you can
see it's just a beautiful beautiful kind
of coral orange next one I want to
mention is NARS deep throat I knew I was
gonna love this color which is why i
purchased hit because i was like i need
that color of my life i know i'm gonna
love it the perfect pink peachy shade
with some shimmer in it but not too much
all it's nothing like super orgasm I'd
actually don't really like super orgasm
because there's so much chunky glitter
in it it's just not my thing this is
beautiful as a really gorgeous pink
shame to your cheeks I feel like this
can go with any look as well last one is
drugstore and i really recommend anybody
to go to charity culture calm or
wherever they sell Jordana and try their
blushes because they are the best
drugstore blushes I've ever tried I
could never like before I could never
find a drugstore blush I liked because
they were never payment enough other
than Rimmel I did used to love one by
Rimmel and I still do it's actually one
of my palettes but other than that one
this is this actually toss that it's the
best drugstore blush so they have a more
trade culture the only a few dollars
really really an expense
and they come in little tins like this
love the packaging this color has been
my favorite for the month it's called
touch of pink it's the most beautiful
everyday color it goes with every single
I look I do I can do a really nice smoky
eye or a really nice fresh look and this
will go with anything you're wondering
that's it right there the last kind of
makeup beauty item is these links lashes
also that leads off hautelook there are
winks by georgi false lashes and the
ones I'm wearing right now are called
you whiskey and soft number fours this
is what the packaging looks like and
this is another one that I have their
the fullness and flare number twos I
love the fact that these are kind of
thinner on the in on the inside and it's
thicker on the outer edges gorgeous is a
new perfume I got from Nordstrom and I'm
all cest with this scent it is the marc
jacobs daisy sunshine perfume this is
limited edition they no longer have it
at sephora from what i saw online when i
tried to get it but i did get mine at
nordstrom about a week and a half ago
and i'm so happy i did because the first
time I smell too i was at Nordstrom and
I passed on it I don't know why but I
kept thinking about and thinking about
it and I realized I wanted it so bad so
I want to support to try to get it and
they didn't have any and then went on
Nordstrom and I found it on there so if
you want this go look and see if it's
still there i'll actually put all links
to all these products down below any
coupon codes i might have i'll put those
below as well but this is just a
gorgeous set it is it is really summery
it's fresh its kind of is it fruity I
don't know if it's kind of fruity I
don't know I'm not good at describing
perfumes but just trust me it's home so
good I'll put a link down below if i can
find it so definitely check the bottom
bar if you are interested and then
another one is my L'Oreal l nett
hairspray I've been using this a lot
this month it's just my go-to hairspray
because I can spray all my hair but
I end up not liking it I can brush
through my hair and it's not really like
white flakes or anything and this still
makes your hair feel like hair like it's
not stiff it's not crunchy anything so
highly recommend it you can get it at
pretty much any drug store and the
second to last thing is I have actually
been using a new self tanner and it is
the st. Tropez self-tan dark and I have
been loving this it is cheaper on QVC a
lot of you told me that so I went and
looked and it definitely is cheaper but
I love this it gives you so dark now
when you first apply it I do two layers
it makes you look kind of green don't
freak out because that's that kind of
all of the color it's going to give you
so you're going to be green when you
first apply it but once you go in the
shower the next morning and wash it off
you have a gorgeous natural tan and it
does last for a week and it fades
amazingly so I highly recommend this I
actually think I love this more than the
Sun guys which is saying a lot because I
have raved about sun goddess since June
of last year so this is like the newest
self tanner I've tried like that's not
my million-dollar tan spray tan system
which probably nothing will top that
because I'm obsessed with it but for
just you know individual kind of self
tanner just too easily apply I have been
loving this and the mousse is very easy
to apply and you didn't want to get the
MIT to make sure you get these danger
payment when you use this it's just
going to make the application a lot
easier when I first apply it I thought I
was really streaky but I wasn't I
applied it all over my body very evenly
and it does look a little bit streaky
but when you wash it off you're not
streaky at all so I don't know what the
deal with that is i guess it's just the
color guard but hands down you guys i'm
obsessed with it and it does have a more
pleasant smell than the Sun Goddess
sometimes doesn't really have like a
horrible smell but it's very chemical
smelling this one does not smell like
that last thing I want to mention is my
phone case I love this little thing it's
like a dream catcher with some studs on
the end
I love it some people might think it's
gaudy but I think it's amazing and i'll
put the etsy seller down below as well
so i hope you guys enjoy this favorite
video like i said i'll have all links to
everything i mentioned down below don't
forget to like the video if you liked it
and my next video will be a tutorial so
keep an eye out for that and i will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
