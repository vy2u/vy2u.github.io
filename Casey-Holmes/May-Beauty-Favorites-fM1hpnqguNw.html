my main favourites and I'm excited to
film this for you guys because I have a
ton of new products to show you that I
discovered in this month so I'm gonna
try to not make this a 20 minute video
but I can't guarantee anything so we're
just gonna go ahead and hop on into the
video the first thing I want to talk
about are false lashes I've discovered a
new brand in May that I have been really
loving and it is house of lashes false
lashes and they're really awesome I'm
wearing when they called I'm wearing the
temptress ones which you're really wispy
lashes they're awesome for like everyday
or even just a dramatic look like I have
one now so the loving food trous also
siren Simon's a really great one as well
and I've also been loving noir ferry
which these are definitely more dramatic
I use these in my Urban Decay tutorial
so if you guys never check that video I
will link it down below but another
thing I've been really loving from house
of lashes is their eyelash glue it is by
far my favorite glue I have ever tried
in my life it is so easy to use it gets
tacky really quickly and when your
lashes are on they are on for good so
make sure you use makeup remover to take
off those lashes because otherwise you
might pull out some of your eyelashes
because this stuff is no joke
but it's amazing by far my favorite I
will never use duo again and this is
about 8 bucks I think now moving on to
skin care act 2 from Mac I really
quickly want to mention that I've showed
a lot in my videos this month first one
is the oil control lotion from Mac I
love this stuff it is so awesome
especially to put on right before you
apply your makeup like in the morning
time I'll do my morning skincare and
I'll wait a little while before I come
in and do my makeup just because I don't
go straight into my makeup room and
apply my makeup so I like to moisturize
again just to kind of make sure my skin
is nice and hydrated
and this one's perfect when you first
try it out it's kind of like you feel
like it's going to be a little bit too
moisturizing once you give it a few
minutes to set it will really sink it to
the skin nicely it doesn't leave a
greasy film on top of your skin like
some moisturizers can do and it is so
awesome it makes your skin feel so
smooth this stuff is amazing
I love
it hasn't broken me out nothing like
that and then this one I want to talk
about for priming this is the Mac prep
and prime of vibrancy eye primer I've
been really enjoying this this month it
makes my under eyes so moisturize very
very smooth I do not use this as an
under eye moisturizer have a totally
different eye cream for that purpose but
I love this for what I'm applying my
makeup like right before I apply
foundation or whatever I'll put this
underneath my eyes so when I go to put
on concealer it just glides on and never
looks cakey it just looks really smooth
and it's so perfect I love this so much
I highly recommend it if you're looking
for a really great under eye primer next
I want to talk about two more primers
really quickly these are the bare
minerals primetime primers and the baby
primer cream and medium and then I have
the old control primer as well
I've knew the old control one first and
then the BB one second I used these in
my last makeup tutorial so if you want
to see them in action
I will leave that down below for you too
before I love this one to counteract my
redness which is the one with the tint
and it just helps me not apply as much
foundation if I just use this ahead of
time and this also creates a really nice
smooth darkness to the skin so that's
why I really love this I'm actually
believe I'm about to be out of it maybe
even like down here I've been using it
so much and then this one of course is
just to help control your oil and I'm
always about trying new oil control
primers and this one has been one of my
favorites lately so bare minerals have
been kind of winning me over with their
primers lately I love them I'm sorry my
hair is like absolutely crazy today it's
just not working for me this is the
Gerard cosmetics Beauty plus
illuminating cream I know a ton of
people have talked about this and I just
started using this this month you can
see my bottle is like super dirty but I
just started using this and I absolutely
love it for what I'm doing a day to
night makeup look which I plan on
filming that for you guys very soon I
have a date tonight makeup look that I
go to and it's just one of my favorites
and it lasts literally all day so this
is one of the products I like to use in
it for what I'm highlighting I will just
apply this to the top of my cheekbones
after I've applied my foundation and
then I'll put the powder highlighter on
top and it really helps lock that
highlighter
so it does not move all day and it still
stays nice and shiny at the top of my
cheekbones this is such a gorgeous color
- it's literally right up my alley
I love this it's just like a champagne
gold color and it's just it's beautiful
that highlight look at that is so pretty
I know some people like to mix it in
with their foundation
I don't mix highlighters in with my
foundation and that's just not something
that I personally like especially during
the spring and summer time but I do like
things like this to kind of act as a
highlighter primer if you could say okay
so now we're going to talk about blushes
I have been loving a ton of blush of
this month but I narrowed it down to
five to show you guys because I didn't
want this video to be really really long
so I was like okay we're only doing five
so first one I want to talk about is
from Mac this is a Mac blush and
cantaloupe it is so pretty you guys I
said this in my haul if there was a
blush that was supposed to be named
after me this would be the color I love
so much it is a velvety smooth blush it
just glides on the skin I'm straining
right here it's a nice just warm peachy
color and I love it I have it on right
now I just have a light wash of it and
it's one of my favorite blushes ever I
just apply this all the time it's
perfect and then I've also been loving
to becca blushes this month the first
one is damselfly damselfly is a
beautiful beautiful color i think this
is a great color for everyday this is
also again a gorgeous peachy pink color
and those are my favorite kind of
blushes i love peaches peachy pink a
little bit pink but not too pink those
are just my favorite kinds of luscious
especially for spring and summer and
this one's just beautiful I love so much
and then we also have songbird which
I've been using a ton lately is so so
pretty this is a darker blush and it's
more of like a burnt orange color and I
love it it has a gorgeous gold Sheen to
it as well I really enjoy this color a
lot a lot
with these lucious is all you're going
to need because they are velvety smooth
and very pigmented but this one is just
oh it is so pretty I love that orange
color you guys know it even watch me for
a little while you know I love my
oranges okay next blush is the last
peachy blush I'm going to show you guys
this is tarts blush and captivating I
did feature this in my last video as
well this is just that perfect peach
color and I love it so much these tart
blushes are amazing they do last for so
long and I love this for any look
honestly I could pair a peachy blush is
pretty much anything and I think it
looks completely fine I mean right here
all these blushes look the same on my
hands but I swear that's completely
different and then glass blush is this
NARS blush in Madley this is such a
gorgeous warm apricot color and it does
have some shimmer in it but you can't
really tell it all and this is a darker
shade so you could even just use this
and skip out on bronzer but personally I
still always use a bronzer or eye
contour if anything then I will use this
blush on my cheeks and it creates a
gorgeous bronze to glow to the skin and
I like that and shimmers in it but it's
not super shimmering like you wouldn't
be able to tell on your cheek and it
blends out really really well this is
probably the creamiest NARS blush that I
have so this is absolutely stunning
really quickly I want to mention the
highlighter I've been using a non-stop
this month again these are by Becca
Becca has had my heart lately even
though I hate packaging I love the
product on the inside this one is in the
color opal I have just used this
non-stop because I think it's absolutely
beautiful it's just a gorgeous kind of
golden bronzer and looks great with a
tan very creamy
super super pigmented and this also
looks great over that Gerard BB cream
and if you can see it but this also
looks great over that Gerard BB cream
because they're kind of like that same
color scheme so this is beautiful but
then another one I believe that Rebecca
this was my first pride of joy this is
moonstone from Becca
which is just a gorgeous champagne
highlight I think it's just a classic
highlight it's beautiful you can see the
difference between this one which is
opal and then moon
right here for a setting powder I have
been loving my laura mercier translucent
setting powder this is amazing you guys
at abusing it ever since I got it and I
actually like this more than they make
up forevers super madness powder which
that's saying a lot because I have gone
through three jars of that and I just
love it this one for the amount of money
that you pay it I think it's around the
same price as I makeup for everyone this
is a full ounce of product and I think
the makeup for everyone is 0.35 so if
you want more bang for your buck I would
get this one and I love how if it makes
my skin look really nice and kind of
soft focused and airbrush in a way and I
like translucent powders because I feel
like they never make me look cakey and
they're just beautiful to set your
makeup when I go to lip combo first off
this lip liner this is max lip liner and
stripped down oh I love it I have it on
today I think this is like the perfect
Kylie Jenner lips lip liner cuz
everybody has been talking about her
lips and doing makeup tutorials for her
but I feel like this would be the
perfect shape to kind of get that
gorgeous plump Kylie Jenner lip because
it's just awesome I love it it is a
darker color but it looks really
beautiful especially with a darker nude
which I have been loving darker nudes
I don't really like creme de nude or
anything like that anymore this is
beautiful I even like to apply this all
over as like my full-on lip color and
then just top it off with the nude gloss
or something I've used it so much it
stays on for so long as well and then
for lipstick I have a loving freckle
tone some people sent in one my my
makeup tutorial I think it was coral and
bronze they didn't like this lipstick
because it looked like my foundation on
my lips which I don't know how but this
is a gorgeous peachy nude I absolutely
adore this I don't have any nudes like
this and again you guys know I'm loving
the peachy tones so this is perfect for
me right now I have it on again today
and I just love the combo especially
with stripped down if I put strip down
like all over my lips and then put this
on top I just I love the combo it's just
a darker peachy nude and perfect I mean
it's not everybody's cup of tea but I
have been loving it and then to top
everything off I know
you guys have heard me talk about this
but I want to mention them because I've
used them non-stop the color your smile
whitening lightening glosses in nude and
coral craze have been my go-to I used
coral craze in my last video I love them
can't get enough have the nude one on
today the boo boo looks so ugly
this is concealer on it only someone
who's addicted of makeup would be like
let's just put some concealer on it so
the last product I want to talk about is
hands-down probably my favorite parts of
the month that I found because its first
office drugstore and honestly I didn't
expect to love it as much as I do this
is the l'oreal voluminous mist magna the
minute i say it mascara is amazing you
guys seriously this is like a perfect
dupe for the better than sex mascara in
my personal opinion what it does to my
lashes the it does the same exact thing
that the Too Faced better than sex one
does but it's like half the price so
this is beautiful on my days where I
have not been wearing lashes which is
been a lot recently since the weather
has been getting warmer I've just been
using this and I loved the way that my
lashes looked again if you want to see
them I did use this in my last video as
well but it's perfect you guys I think I
don't I don't think I've found a
drugstore mascara that's really made me
as excited as this one this has to be
the top mascara out of all of the
mascaras I've tried hands-down 100% the
best one ever I love it so I do have a
few skincare favorites but I'm gonna
feature those in my routine videos I'm
gonna do cuz I'm gonna do an updated one
so you can see what I've been using and
I'm gonna just show you guys in those
videos since this one already has like a
ton of products in it so yeah I hope you
guys enjoy it in this video let me know
in the comments what your favorite
makeup product was for the month
especially drugstore the reason why I
haven't been using a lot of new
drugstore stuff is because nobody around
me my old time at Walgreens CVS Rite Aid
is getting these new collections like
seriously where the hell are all these
collections at because I have not seen
any of them when Maybelline had like
their neon something their neon
collection I never saw that I haven't
seen any new collections at all and it's
just pissing me off
I want to play with the new stuff
but nobody has any of it around me I
don't know what's going on I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did
please give it a thumbs up and don't
forget to subscribe to my channel to not
miss out on any of my videos and I will
see you all in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
