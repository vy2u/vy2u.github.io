on this maybelline baby skin instant
pore eraser I've had so many questions
ever since I showed this in my drugstore
haul which if you haven't seen that I
will link that down below but I've had a
lot of questions about it and I really
wanted to give it a good try before I
told you guys what I thought of it so
this is at the drugstore for I think
like six seven eight dollars maybe
probably less than that it's for
Maybelline and it says instant pore
eraser basically is supposed to blur out
your pores and make them look not as
visible don't believe that it claims to
actually fill them in I think it just is
supposed to learn them out like so when
you put your foundation on you can't
really see the pores as well I know a
lot of people are kind of comparing this
to the benefit Porefessional and saying
it's a dupe I will say I don't agree
with that because the benefit
Porefessional really fills in your pores
and really makes them look nice and
minimized
you know it's not going to completely
get rid of the pore and you can't see it
it's just going to minimize the look of
them and that's why I really like it so
I think that they're both different more
than anything this just goes like on top
of your pores I don't think that it
completely minimizes them this is nice
though it's definitely on a different
texture it's kind of like that silicone
feel and the benefit wants a little bit
more thick and I'll show you guys a
close-up of both of them it's a very
silky product this is the kind of
product that I would be nervous to wear
in the summertime especially having oily
skin because things like this can make
me very very oily so far with this
primer I haven't gotten like really
greasy or anything but I do use a
mattifying primer on top of any pore
products that I use just because I want
to make sure I stay nice and matte that
might have a take in it I don't ever not
use a mattifying primer so you know I
didn't want to try it without that but I
think this kind of formula would
definitely be a little too silky for me
in the summer months this product I feel
like just kind of lays on top of your
pores and when you put your foundation
on it just gives a little bit of a
minimized pore look if you have larger
pores you know what I'm talking about
it's just really hard to find stuff
that's going to minimize look at your
pores completely you're never ever
get rid of your pores you just gotta
find things that work for your skin I
know a lot of people bought this primer
because they love deep baby lips I never
liked the Baby Lips I didn't think it
did anything for me so I wasn't buying
this just because I loved those little
chap sticks or anything I just when I
see instant pore minimizer I'm just like
hmm if you have larger pores obviously
you want to look for stuff like this and
when you find it you expect it to really
minimize look your pores and I just
don't feel like it did that very well
for me I think it is a nice primer just
up create a nice smooth surface on your
face but I don't agree with the claim of
minimizing the look of them I have
noticed you know I haven't broken out
with this or anything so if you have
sensitive skin I've definitely checked
this out because I have very very
sensitive skin and it's hard to find
things that actually work for me if you
don't have really large pores and you're
not necessarily looking for a primer to
minimize them I would definitely go for
this but if you have larger pores I
think that this isn't you know the best
one out there but this does create a
nice smooth surface a couple more good
things about this primer is it's very
lightweight it's not heavy on the skin
and it doesn't make me feel super greasy
or anything which I was kind of
surprised about because I'm not a huge
fan of like siliconed based primer if
you're looking for a good drugstore
primer I would check this out because I
feel like it does keep your makeup on
very very well I just don't agree with
the poor claims that's what I think
about this primer I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and found it helpful

leave them in the comments below and
yeah let me know what you think of this
primer as well I hope you guys enjoyed
