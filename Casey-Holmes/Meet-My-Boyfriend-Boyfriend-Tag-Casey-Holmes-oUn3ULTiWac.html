we're going to answer some questions
from Twitter for you guys and see you
have said so just gonna win yet are you
ready yeah okay how did we meet
I always tell them your dad tells the
whole story though whole shebang we're
at the square in our hometown and I was
at a bar called the tavern and I was
with a buddy who invited her to come
hang out with him and so she walked in
the door and I told him that she was
there so then from that point on I
thought they were together they thought
she had a boyfriend
so I was not interested in all I thought
you'd look
okay okay so in addition we shook hands
I still thought she had a boyfriend so I
was just kind of playing it cool all
night and then we were at the pub and
she bought a bunch of a shots but I
walked off so I was flirting with him
the whole night I was having none of it
manaman he was dead an office no I just
thought she had a boyfriend I try to be
respectful that's the shot every shot my
friend took my keys got invited me yes
sharing his flat well in his pocket I'm
sorry so he walked off well then we went
to plates which was right across the
street and he introduced us more there
we started talking a little bit more
there and we started walking away from
plates
she called me David oh yeah by the way
his name's Davis he's not new years old
my baby so I was like okay she doesn't
even know my name
so then we walked up back to the tavern
right where it all started when I first
saw ya right after he took my keys and
everything and we started talking at the
bar um I was drinking this poor voice
training with me he talked to me all
night at one point I went to the
bathroom and I was like hey you're not
here when I get back it was great
talking yeah and I was like oh then she
bought us some shots for legal buttery
nipples
and she told me to make the toast well
funny story we both went to the same
high school when I was in ninth and
tenth grade she was 11 to talk to me not
playing it too smooth made the toast to
being an old cougar older she didn't
take that - well I didn't mean it like
that so I had to change my toast and so
I said here's to taking a shot with
another man's girlfriend again I failed
she meant what I have a boyfriend
what and so I gave up on the toast we
drank the shot and then we started
talking because I realized she didn't
have a boyfriend and it's the most
intelligent conversation they ever had
at a bar this good mark Martok we didn't
talk about Bar things talk about school
and life host ever since ever since
unfortunately I left for Europe the next
day yeah all mine for a month
so through FaceTime texting and a couple
letters here and there managed to keep
her interest next question
things all right we'll do this one thing
you don't like about each other
what well one thing that bothers you
it's hard to answer your question is
your answer
haha how do you guys continue to make
things work with the distance please
come yeah I like little things to like
you sent me a letter like out of the
blue that was really sweet
um I bought me a random gift yeah
crashed it daily yeah but like it's the
little thing but we don't know when
we're doing certain things for each
other and it's like we're do a lot of
small things I feel I'd say that in
planning this short bike all right
when's the next time I'm gonna see you
okay I just have to get through three
weeks and I see we plan the next string
the next time there's small targets it
can get difficult because sometimes we
can tell when we're getting a little
what's the word frustrated gab because
the distance sucks so bad but definitely
face times like the biggest thing I
think if you just talk on the phone that
connection is just not there you know
you're not looking at you are you guys
dressing up together
yes I just don't know what I'm gonna be
yeah I'm gonna be a tiger
if you guys have any suggestions for him
for witches Halloween leave it in the
comments below where do you guys plan on
living once you guys are ready to move
in together depends on where I get a
sound honestly yeah for the first like
almost year
if I get infantry albeit fort benning so
that's only an hour away from where
we're at right now
Oh golly sandy it looks for a year
have you seen your videos before you
know who she was
if my friend women told him what I did
he would have never known I mean he
would have known but he would have known
later Thanks
what brought you two together
more things like it's so weird to
because hi I like yeah it's so weird
because with the same high school
together we add each other on Facebook
years ago don't remember it and we
messaged each other and Facebook on a
wall yeah we've had exchange of
conversation I creeped on his face but
not long ago I was like who is this guy
who town never season before what do
each of you see in a future for both of
you exploring Allah we both have really
high ambitions so I think with the drive
that she has and that I have sitting
pretty it's gonna be good what's one
thing Casey doesn't know about you could
be a weird habit etc love you guys thank
you
well if you don't know about it probably
a reason I was good thing you don't know
I thought we've had this conversation do
you have like a weird habit I don't know
about biting my nails I know about that
I really know about them
I pretty much know all your growth
habits and weird something that you
don't know yeah
did you know I've been life flighted
twice you know like chocolate milk
oh yeah I pretty much know like
everything about you I feel like all of
our long we've had so much time to talk
that we just we know I don't have
anything that you don't know about I
really don't know so
nothing what's one thing you love about
one another you person
she's cool you are very I don't know the
word for it but he's very caring and
like he does so many of the little small
things things a word for it would be
caring no but like like you do the small
things like like making my plate or
something or you know rubbing my back
last night while we were in line all
these small things you do they're just
like I care about you okay here's one
what made each of you fall in love with
each other
what made you just I remember the day
that I told myself to have love we were
at your house eating Subway sandwiches
talking about the future and a point of
contention came up on where I wanted to
go in
me and where she didn't want me to go in
the army and it was happened to be the
same exact place and it had me thinking
how if something were to happen where we
couldn't be together I would be
devastated so that's when I knew I loved
her and what made me fall in love with
you would be your personality
just everything everything about it
um well thank you well for me it's like
I told him like I've met a lot of people
but the night that I met him and like
shook his hand at the pub which was not
the tech now the very first place he saw
me but the first place I saw him and was
introduced I like felt it like I was
just like this weird feeling that came
over me and I was like okay I cannot
like this this kid needs to mind like a
success already there's something about
him that I needed and I'm really
instantly got spiritual and like
connections and things like that and I
just feel like God him in my way to like
meet him and when I knew I was in love
that's the hard question because I feel
like I don't feel like there's a time
where I didn't feel like I was in love
with you like those two weeks that we
had together with that two weeks ever
what's our favorite things you together
I think things like this exploring it's
been tough
yeah Big Chill don't have to dress up
just being together
does your wife and watch ET videos and
one of his opinions on out on ma do you
watch my two Padilla and we're done
only when she tells me about something
in one I go watch it I also like make
fun of her when she sings songs in her
favorites videos about one second you
guys all love it
so it's son I do it for them do you have
any Corky cute relationship habits or
tradition love you we started like a
little tradition but it's with pictures
where I kiss is cheating oh yeah um when
we go places and really pay attention
with our camera and the Polaroid yeah
Polaroid cameras are new thing - that's
a new tradition I don't think we have
anything like we were handshake yeah we
have our handshake and we he may sleep
its bum bum all the time when he first
told me to do that I was like my new
buddy in my home dog like but now it's
just like so yeah
she's s now hello is there anything you
haven't told him yet is he aware of
everything in your life or do you keep
secrets with him um I don't want to know
everything yeah and he doesn't know
every little detail about what I do in
my life I mean nothing secretive as in
bad secretive like something that would
be disrespectful so no to that
he doesn't know like little small things
I do when I'm home like if I go out
shopping or something like that you know
stupid stuff
he doesn't know unless he calls me when
I'm doing it he pretty much knows
everything about me and my past same for
him I think we were both an open book
yeah which is why it's working so well
cuz you haven't done anything to like
mess it up what song reminds you of each
other on top of the world
oh you do fine yeah top of the world by
Tim McGraw is like a new favorite okay
we're going to answer just a couple more
questions okay what's the first thing
you noticed about each other when you
first first saw you when you first first
saw me your looks I mean
I saw you and I was like hmm like slow
motion air blown I was by myself in this
bar - trying to find my friend I was
like looking around like I'm a lost
puppy had no idea where he was for me I
noticed because he is in a button-down I
was just with him when he isn't it but
down like so handsome
I just noticed how clean he was like
seeing Hut
he just looked really put together he
didn't look like this it was like a
little boy I was like yeah a lot of you
asking for the whisper challenge when I
do that over the weekend when I'm in New
York it's when you put headphones on and
that u.s. first sentence and you have to
guess what I'm saying oh yeah it's
really funny any advice on finding a
good boyfriend after a rough breakup and
going through a tough time right now I
have no advice on me do you have do you
have any advice for girls so like if you
had if you had a little sister and she
just broke up with someone or like a
really good friend and he broke up with
her or something don't try too hard
I've been looking for it yeah it'll come
to you yeah literally I've said that in
all my videos if you guys watch my
question and answers videos where
they're mainly about boys and dating
that's all I talk about is like go live
your life
have fun and do your own thing and it
will happen when you least expect it and
just because you break up it's not the
end of the world we both we're not going
to go out the night that we met I was
going to go out so I was in a horrible
mood and I was leaving for Europe the
next day yeah and then we just decided
to go out and then randomly met each
other Oh weird so weird you want to pick
this one pika Pik just kind of scrolling
up yeah question for him were you scared
when she showed you about her YouTube
job and subscribers so I think when I
realized what you were we're watching or
what you did we were watching the Sun
Rise and you showed me your Instagram
and I was like this was just to show him
it's a picture it wasn't like to say hey
look at my followers yeah she's just
showing a picture I think of your G yeah
um you saw how many likes wrong yeah it
was like okay time out right at the top
look at the subscribe followers and I
was like um

okay cool you got like 600 followers or
so okay okay and then you're like yeah
side of YouTube then you click your
channel and I was like 980,000 what who
are you
and so I was like oh Lord if I get too
deep into this and then screw it up
that's a million people are gonna hate
me
yeah but obviously it didn't notice bad
we've been very careful to but we made
sure we waited until we knew we wanted
to be together that we had said okay
