to be doing a wear test on the newest
milk makeup blurring stick I've tried
this a couple times so I'm going to show
you guys how it wears throughout the day
we're going to do half of my face with
this product and half of my face with my
favorite primer that you guys know which
is the Kate and Austin and mattifying
primer we're going to be how both of
these wear if they're similar if they're
not I believe this one's a little bit
more pricier than the milk makeup lines
but yes so we're going to do a
demonstration and see if there's any
difference between the two I've actually
already try this out so I already kind
of know what it's going to be like but I
do think I would share with you guys it
is $36 there's only one shade and when I
looked at their site yesterday it had
almost 5 stars which i think is pretty
pretty good so so comes the defrosted
tube like this just unscrew the top and
then there's your product it does have a
tint to it and I'll show you guys this
has a tint to it as well very similar to
this this is just a little bit darker
you guys have probably seen a lot of
reviews on this but I did purchase -
Sephora I honestly have not happy ok
yeah we can't do that in here we go
not in here I'm trying to be home I love
you though can I take it I'm just going
to do it on this side of my face
so just swipe it now it does have some I
don't know what you call this like
little clump that comes off sometimes
it's like a dry feeling on your skin it
doesn't I don't know I don't know how to
really explain it it tugs at your skin I
don't really like how hard it is to
apply I just feel like it makes my skin
feel more dry but once you get it on and
you start rubbing it in you can feel the
product it's just a little like not
pleasant to apply that makes any sense
so that is this I done you can see the
difference it did modify it did kind of
blur out my pores a little bit it gave
my skin a nice smooth finish and also
this is not clog my pores or make me
break out I want to add that as well
we're going to go in with my pain and
often modifying primer here's the -
right there excuse my nails I'm getting
them done Monday I promise this ones
they can't do one this was the milk
makeup the no makeup is a little bit
lighter but they still have that same
tint going on I'm going to put this this
can awesome one also kind of contacts
that redness as well but I feel like
became an awesome one you can really
tell when it blurs out your pores
of a darker tint you can kind of see it
on your skin and then times much more of
a moisturizing feeling you're not like
tugging at your skin very much so you
can kind of see that depends a little
bit darker on this side
this design is lipstick in an Austin
primer looks like if you guys are new to
my channel and you don't really know
what the hell is going on my skin I do
have really sensitive skin I have
rosacea as well I actually went to the
dermatologist the other day and every
dermatologist that I go to always
recommends laser treatment for my
rosacea but I want you guys to tell me
like have you ever had it before you
notice the difference or not because it
ain't cheap not cheap at all but if it
works I would love it and it would help
with texture and all that because
obviously with rosacea comes texture let
me know if you guys have never had that
if you had since the skin or anything
I'm really interested in hearing from
people who have had it done instead of
me just winging it and getting laser on
my face this is what it looks like I
feel like my skin looks pretty good
right now I feel like it looks really
smooth it's mattified and we're ready to
go and we're ready to go so nice the
shade 0 4 &amp;amp; 0 2 now this foundation does
not accentuate your pores or anything
like that
actually 3 good on the skin I don't wear
foundations accentuate my pores so I
don't really have one to share with you
guys but we're just going to see how it
wears throughout the day with this
foundation so again I'm mixing 0 2 &amp;amp; 0 4
obviously if you have texture nothing's
going to really make your skin look
completely airbrushed because she's not
practical if you have texture on your
skin you have texture you know what I
mean all you can do is kind of try to
fill in your pores and to really make
sure you wear foundations and stuff that
aren't going to make it look super
intense and also dry out your skin
that's just what I kind of realized as
the years have gone on with so I mixed
the two shades and we apply it to my
face with my L'Oreal sponge
that is what the foundation it looks
like so far it looks pretty much the
same on both sides my pores are not
accentuated at all anything like that
everything went on really smooth so now
we're going to move on to concealer so
it looks like with Foundation and
concealer on they're both pretty
identical again nothing is really
sinking into the pores or accentuating
it whatsoever which is really important
to me a primer needs to really hold up
make sure nothing sinks in there and
really create that nice barrier so now
I'm in finish the rest of my face makeup
and I'm going to come back show you guys
my skin and then we're going to go
throughout the day and see if there's
any difference with each side okay guys
so I just finished up with my makeup and
this is what it looks like and don't
know what a light makeup alone so I just
put bronzer in the crease because I've
been busy okay it can't be bothered with
doing eyeshadow right now I think both
primers look pretty identical right now
in my opinion both have blurred out my
pores really nicely right in this area
they both took makeup on really well of
course this women is you know I love the
team and often one but the milk makeup
is holding up really well so far
and it was easy to blend everything out
on top of that primary going to wear
this throughout the day of course for
you guys along as well and give you a
little updates and what you see both
sides so I will see you guys in just a
few hours I'm going to give you guys a
really quick update and natural light I
don't know if you can really tell but
there's not much of a difference on a
chick-fil-a in their relatives hopefully
not get me receipts but I don't really
see much of a difference this is one
side you can see some texture and then
this is the other I think both sides
kind of look similarity this I did look
a little bit smoother I'm a bit more
mattified but that's okay that's my
little update so far it's been about
three and a half hours I just went to a
birthday party for my grandma and now
I'm gonna get some food eat and then I'm
going to have some dinner with one of my
good friends and then we're also going
out for drinks with my other best
friends so today is like a day so the
friends and really excited about it's
been a while how do you ask if I have
friends I do
just getting older don't have a lot of
time you know there's your update
there's like a up close look you can
just say the side looks a little bit
smoother see how holds up for the next
few hours hi guys so it's the next day I
know you're probably like Casey what the
hell are you doing follow my snapchat
you know that I got home really late
last night
2/3 it's on the end of the update video
but it took me so long to get through it
I was like okay now what are you going
to do a little voiceover I was honestly
so tired when I got home that like I did
took me forever to film the ending of
this video I wanted to come on here and
give you guys an update and let you know
my opinions on it and I will say when I
got home last night when I turn my
lights on my foundation looked awful I
don't know what it was it just looked
really really bad I want to live because
I had it on all day like all day long it
was it looked really bad but my texture
was a little more enhanced it could be
because I didn't blot very much
throughout the day or anything like that
the side that I liked the most was still
my pain and Austin mattifying primer
because it kept me matte longer than the
mulk makeup one and it kind of is that
all-in-one product for me where it's
going to keep me matte it's gonna smooth
out my pores and my texture and then the
milk makeup one is definitely more for
the blurring aspect I do think it's a
good product but I wouldn't buy it again
I know I'm not beneath all the time I
don't like how you have to tell you your
face how dry it feels and I'm not trying
to make this a negative review because I
want to say if you have like normal skin
or even combo skin you might really like
this if you don't get very oily and
being matte is not something that you're
concerned about you would probably
really like that product as you guys saw
in the beginning of this video you saw
like the clump that were coming off when
I was typing it on my face and I don't
know how it would work on dry skin I
feel like it was really drying on me if
you had dry skin it would probably
accentuate dryness I don't know though
let me know if you have dry skin if
you've tried it I want to hear your
opinions on it and of course leave in
the comments below that way everybody
can see what you recommend and all that
that's what we're here for we're all
here for each other so the milk makeup
one is $36 it came in Austin and my
I'm primer is $56 so it is $20 more does
sucks but it does have SPF 50 in it and
it says it's for all skin types
on the poorest website I really like it
kind of my redness and all of that
really nicely that's just my opinion on
it again the makeup one is not bad but I
think it depends on what you're looking
for with the primers I'm sorry my my
pajamas for the ending of this video but
I really wanted to kind of wrap it up
and hit some bullet points that I didn't
hit last night because I'm so tired I
just didn't even remember you guys again
so much watching I hope you have a good
Super Bowl Sunday just going up today I
love you guys don't get to subscribe and
I will see you all in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
