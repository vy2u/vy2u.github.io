a makeup tutorial on this look right
here I love this look and I used quite a
bit of new products in this video so
hopefully you guys like it I've gotten
so many different makeup products lately
from things that have been sent to me or
I just made like a huge Sephora order
that I'm about to film right now but I
didn't use anything from that anyways I
just got like a whole bunch of makeup
lately so there's like a ton of new
products coming your way so you guys can
see them in action but one of the new
products that I received in the mail was
this morphia what is it
350 palette and I opened it and I was
like yes if I had to have my own kind of
palette these will be my shades and I
love it only think I had to reach out of
this palette for was a black and I went
into my NYX alot pop palette and use the
black from here and it was fine so that
is one color that I wish was in here
just a nice matte black otherwise though
this is a really great palette
everything blends so beautifully I don't
have any trouble with it at all and I
think I saw the coupon code for this if
you want to check it out but I highly
recommend it out of all of the morphe
palettes this one has to be my favorite
just because I love the neutrals and
this is such a beautiful palette for
fall cuz fall it's coming up whether
some of us like it or not it's coming
and I'm excited so I love these the
oranges the Browns are kind of mustard
it's just it's a really beautiful
palette so if you guys have once you see
how I got this makeup look then just
keep watching okay so this is the
palette up close isn't it so beautiful
you need it in your life I'm gonna take
this shade right here and put this into
the crease it's more of a peachy medium
brown shade and like I said I'm gonna
put that into the crease as our
transition shade and just build it up a
little bit so it's nice and opaque then
I'm going to take this shade right here
and with a flat shader brush from Mac
I'm gonna put this all over my lid I do
kind of build this up to deepen it
then I'm gonna take that same che we use
in the beginning and just blend down the
edges of the color we put on next up
we're taking this shade right here and
putting this all over the lid as well I
wanted to just deepen it up a little bit
more so that's why I went back in with
this shade if you didn't want to go
darker you don't have to do this taking
that shade in the beginning again and
just blending it out
and then I'm taking this Avant pop
palette from NYX and I'm using the matte
black and I'm just going to dust this on
the outer corner and I love this all on
pop palette by the way it's really
really great it has some great colors in
there and it's super pigmented and easy
to blend so you can see I'm just
fluffing that color right there in the
outer V and just dragging a little bit
into my crease this really transforms
the look it makes it look really deep
and smoky and I just love the way that
it turned out taking that shade again we
used on the lid I'm going to just blend
this out so that the black isn't too
harsh and it all looks seamless
then we're gonna go ahead and take off
the tape and put on some liner I'm using
this makeup forever ink liner which is a
really nice matte liner and I am going
to do a wing then I'm using these lashes
in boudoir by house of lashes and then I
went ahead and primed my face with my
favorite primers and then I'm using the
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation in
warm beige
next up I'm taking the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer and I'm putting this
underneath my eyes on my nose chin and
forehead it's gonna help highlight and
conceal any dark circles that we have
underneath our eyes taking the
toothpaste a cocoa contour palette we're
gonna use this one right here and set
that concealer with this shade then I'm
taking this Dior bronzer and I'm going
to just bronze my skin with this this
one's like an oldie but a goodie I
really really love this bronzer
and I'm gonna take this shade in the
contour palette I'm just going to
contour my face with this and I'm using
my NARS eat a brush because I can't get
away from it I just love it
using this two-faced blush and Baby Love
I want to put this on my cheeks
this gives just a really natural flush
to the cheeks and I love it
so so much it is absolutely beautiful
then I'm taking this highlight shading
here and I ended up not loving it just
because it wasn't what I wanted it just
it really didn't pop on the cheekbones
like I wanted it to so I went in with
heatwave by Estee Lauder and I just put
it on top and I got the desired
highlight that I wanted using this
Anasazi eyebrow mate bow made really the
fall made I put that on my brows and
just filled them in then I'm taking that
shade I just showed you and highlighting
my brow with this
using this NARS via veneto eyeliner I'm
just going to put this on my waterline
and then we're gonna take this shade
right here which is a fun I don't even
know how to explain it it's just a
really pretty glittery color and we're
going to smudge this underneath our
lower lash line and this just adds
something different to the look it's a
little bit shimmery and it's not super
super dark I love it it creates a nice
shadow underneath the eye and I feel
like it just really pulls it all
together and makes it look even more
fall then I'm using my mix of skinny
mascara and I'm just using this for my
bottom lashes because this is an amazing
bottom lash mascara
and then the eyes are complete and now
we're moving on to the lips so I'm using
this 24/7 glide on pencil in 1993 by
Urban Decay one of my favorites right
now absolutely love it actually this
whole lip combo I'm about to show you is
my favorite so I'm gonna fill in my lips
just a little bit with this lip pencil
and then I'm gonna top it off with bow
and arrow from Kat Von D and it gives me
my favorite shade at the moment I just
am so in love with this combo so happy I
mix them together because it's my new
go-to and then when you're done with
that your look is complete thank you so
much for watching if you liked it please
give it a thumbs up and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
