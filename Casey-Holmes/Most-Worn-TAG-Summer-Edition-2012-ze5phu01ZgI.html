know i was tagged by ingrid to do this
video which is missglamorazzi i love the
idea of it that she kind of combined
different things into one video i was
going to do a july favorites but once i
realized my july favorites were the same
thing or the same products as i was
going to mention in this video I was
like I'll just do this one because it
kind of has jewelry accessed it or not
joy but it has accessories in it and
fashion you know things that I've warned
so I figured I just go ahead and do this
one I thought you might like it a little
bit more so yeah I hope you guys enjoy
and let's get started the first question
is most more nail polish and it is
definitely this julieg nail polish in
bikini I have used this so much this
summer I've either combined it with
colors use it on his own it's just one
of the best nail polishes ever it's like
a perfect neon coral pink color I love
it and it's like under five dollars
which is amazing so I'd love I love this
and used it a ton the next question is
most worn stint and it is definitely the
victoria secret bombshell summer perfume
this is from last year i do believe but
I got this one amazon i think in
February March April I don't know one of
those months and i've been using it a
ton this summer i just love the smell it
smells so good I mean it just never gets
old so I think I got this on amazon for
twenty dollars if i can find the link
for it i'll put it down below but this
is definitely just been my all-time
favorites in um most worn hair product I
have to I have the bio Tara dry shampoo
and you can get this at Sally's for ten
dollars I love love love this dry
shampoo it lasts me for a little over
two months and it seriously has done
wonders for my hair I used to not be
able to go like a day without washing my
hair I felt like it was just so oily and
it just looked disgusting but this
really makes my hair look refreshed like
I've never found a dry shampoo that has
ever done the job like this does like
it's just amazing it does leave a white
cast though so if you have darker hair
I'd be careful with it but since I have
blonde on top it's a little bit easier
for me I just really work it
in to my roots and then the second one
is this 12 benefits instant healthy hair
treatment I love the stuff and the
reason why I think it's so great for
summer is because it does so many things
like you can spread this in your hair
for you get the pool to help protect it
from chlorine it helps prevent damage
from the Sun wind heat helps prevent
split ends anything like that is just
amazing and I love this because as most
of you know or as you can just tell I
bleached the top of my hair and I need
something to really help protect you
know my hair when I bleach it and go out
in the Sun and get even more heat and
raised on it so this is just an amazing
it is a thicker consistency but I mean
it's just perfect but don't put too much
of it in your hair because it will make
your hair look greasy and I got that
from my stylist she goes to her little
stylist or whatever and i got it for ten
dollars but i'm not sure where you can
find it if you know where people can
probably find this product lens know
down in the comments and i'll put an
annotation in this video whenever I find
out next is most one bag and it has to
be this one that i got from low back bag
a few months ago is Amelia Anthony purse
it's so heavy but I've used it a ton
this summer it's just been my go-to bag
just to toss everything in and go so
that's definitely been my most worn bag
for my most worn shoes if this is a hard
one because I have a lot of sandals if
you can see like up there mesum pointing
right but I pretty much of a sandal
hoarder I love sandals there's so many
they go so many different things I just
love them but if I had to pick just one
that I like love and try to wear as
often as I can it would be these and I
got these from hautelook for ten dollars
geez Louise they're from the brand Anna
and I just love them they're so cute and
just so pretty i love them so much um I
mean I kind of have to break them in a
little bit more because it kind of hurt
after probably a few hours but these are
so pretty like I deal with the pain
because I love them so much um and if
you don't know what look is basically a
flash site for designer
so they're not on there right now it's
just whenever you know designers come
and go but if you want i'll leave the
link down below so you can go check it
out and whatever those foreign
accessories this was kind of hard
because there wasn't like a set jewelry
that i wore every day other than like my
normal rings but then i was like okay
yeah definitely the sunglasses i have
been wearing these every single day um i
just love them I got them from target I
think they're about ten to fifteen
dollars but i love it because they're so
big so they cover my whole under eye
area and they really do protect my eyes
from the Sun like even if I have the Sun
like right in my face it does not hurt
my eyes at all and also black lenses are
great at really like helping with
wrinkles like you won't get wrinkles as
bad if you have the black lenses I might
sound a little crazy but I read it
somewhere I promise ok so most warm
clothing item I decided to not go and
get all my tank tops but pretty much
it's any tank top camis the ones from
forever 21 they're like 480 I wear those
all the time those are just my go-to
things to wear if I'm not working I just
throw in a tank top because I don't feel
like dressing up half the time so yeah
those are my most worn clothing items my
most warm foundation is this laura
geller balance and Brighton foundation I
absolutely love it i'm a medium this is
definitely a light to medium coverage
depending on how you apply it i just use
a big powder brush and put all over my
face because the most of the concealing
part comes from my concealer which is
the Make Up For Ever full cover
concealer that I have on today and I
have this on but this is really great if
you just want to des something over your
face to kind of even out your skin tone
this is perfect and I feel like since
it's so light it's just great for the
summer and I really love this next is
most warned bless your bronzers I have
two of each for bronzers is definitely
max um bronzer and sauce an and this is
what it looks like I love this for if I
need to kind of bronze my neck or my
chest like around my face if I just
wanna do a quick little bronze this is
the one I go to I've used it in a couple
tutorials and
that in my face routine which I'll link
somewhere in this video so you can go
and check that out and then for
contouring it's definitely been NARS
casino and I've hit some serious pain on
it's super dark easy to blend and I just
really really love that and for blush
this is from the hey sailor collection
as well this is fleet fast I just love
this because it gives the most like
gorgeous color and Sheen to your skin
like it's a satin finish and it just
looks so freaking pretty I love this
blush and then last but not least is
this NARS foreplay palette I was kind of
disappointed with it at first because
it's so small but now I'm just in love
with it basically the whole concept is
to create your own orgasm because orgasm
is the biggest blush in here and then
you have a mat fuchsia am at coral and
then you kind of have like this golden
highlight I absolutely love it i've been
experimenting with it mixing all the
colors and it's just one of my all-time
favorite blush palettes and also i love
the fact that it's so compact and you
can just take it with you and touch up
your blush wherever you go so i really
like that most worn lip product has
definitely been max in a sense be where
this came out with the like shop cook
shop mac I don't know that whole
collection confused me on the name I
honestly didn't even know what was going
on but I did break it which I was very
very sad about so I keep it in the tube
and I don't take it out I keep it in my
little drawer so it stays nice and cool
now but when i use it at use prob about
that much and apply it it's my favorite
nude lipstick doesn't make you look to
nude or anything like that i really wish
this was in the permanent collection but
it's not but that's definitely my most
worn lip product and then for mascara it
has to be this covergirl LashBlast
volume I've been so impressed by this
ever since i did my 15 mascaras video
and you guys recommended this to me i
haven't used any mascara since this has
been my like holy grail for everyday use
and then for eyeshadow the most warrant
eyeshadow for the summer is the Naked
palette and i have been using this every
day i love so much i'm not going to talk
completely about it you know a ton has
it's been shown like a million times
this past year and year before whatever
but i love it so much if i had to choose
between the naked one and nigga to
definitely be in the naked one I just
feel like the colors are more on my
alley and I just I know I like them a
lot more so yeah that is the last
question for this tap and also i just
want to mention i begin a lot of
questions about my hair and my past few
videos that is curled like this i have
been loving the new me reversed wand
this is what i've been using i'll have a
full video everything about it friday so
keep a lookout for it i'll do a tutorial
as well it's just been my all-time
favorite curling wand seriously i love
it so hope you guys enjoy this i will
tag some people down below and i also
tagged all of you to do it and leave it
as a video response i love to see what
your most worn items are for the summer
