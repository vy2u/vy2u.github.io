on my yearly favorite since we are
approaching 2013 there are a few things
that I have constantly used throughout
the year and have repurchased and I
really really really really love so I
definitely wanted to share them with you
guys but I will be doing a December
favorites because I did get some new
things
I think either at the end of November or
no probably the beginning of December
and I wanted to include them in a
favorites video so that will be up
probably a couple videos or a video
after this one I'm not sure yet
okay so the first problems I want to
talk about is something that I started
using and I think in May or June of this
year I can't remember exactly if you've
been watching my videos you already know
about this but it is the Sun Goddess
self-tanner I'm obsessed with it I use
it all the time I haven't had another
one like another self-tanner that I
really really loved other than this one
it's just awesome it gives such a dark
color this is actually my second two
bottle and I'm gonna have to purchase
another one soon because I'm almost done
with this one as well I love this stuff
and that's how I stay tan like like this
is not my natural color I actually just
self tan earlier this morning but it's
just awesome it isn't dark and I just I
mean I can't stress enough how amazing
this self-tanner is moving on to a
skincare pipe this is the Cetaphil oil
control moisturizer this is the best
moisturizer I have ever used on my skin
I got this a few months back I think I
can't remember exactly when I bought it
but I'm actually I'm getting close to
being done with it it's about down to
here now I use it every single day I
just take one pump pump and put it all
over my skin
it's amazing has not making me broke out
I feel like it's definitely reduced my
redness too and a couple other products
have also I'll be doing a skincare video
on that very soon because if you used to
watch my videos you know that my skin
was really really really red and it's
actually gotten a lot better since then
so it's a really simple skincare routine
I use like three or four products and
that's it I'm not complicated at all
when it comes to that kind of stuff but
this is awesome it has SPF 30 and I love
it makes my skin super soft
and it's just the best thing that has
come across in the drugstore for my oily
skin this one's just an obvious favorite
it is my Mac Paint Pot soft soft ochre I
still have not found a primer that is as
great as this I think this case is
amazing base for your eyeshadow it's
awesome next thing you want to talk
about is Maybelline Maybelline has been
one of my favorite brands this year as
well I actually love all of their color
tattoos I have quite a few in my drawer
back here if you see my makeup
collection and my Muji drawers on my
blog channel you've seen that if not all
like the channel name down below but
this has definitely been the one I've
gone to the most and it's just easy
versatile quick and just an easy I look
and it is the color tattoo in bad to the
bronze that's what it looks like it's
gorgeous it's amazing I mean you could
put this on your lid and put a little
bit into your crease and be done with
your eye look it's just that awesome
Maybelline did an amazing job with these
color tattoos they are totally totally
worth it next thing I'm gonna talk about
is concealers these first two concealers
I have actually talked about a lot this
year and every purchase so the first one
is the Rimmel match perfection concealer
this is what it looks like amazing it's
in light I just use this other nice lat
I recommend it and I'm trying to use
this up because I'm almost done with it
but I repurchase this quite a few times
and then the other concealer is this
Maybelline instant Mylene instant age
rewind concealer like for dark circles
or whatever this one is in light pale I
love it I've gone through this a lot
especially this month I mean it's just
fantastic another favorite is the
bronzer this is a very pricy bronzer but
I just love it if I don't want nothing
too crazy like contour wise lately I
have been doing more of a strong contour
but usually in the summertime or
something like that I really just don't
want any like a strong contour I'm more
of a bronze to kind of face I'll use
this and then is this Chanel so late and
a Chanel bronzer
that's the packaging and of course the
product just looks like this it's a
beautiful beautiful bronzer it looks
very natural on the skin I think if you
want to go more on the affordable side I
would
I go within my see sunny bronzer that
one's also been a new favorite for the
month just to kind of learn about my
skin tone but I think this is beautiful
and in the summer time it really does
stay on my oily skin so that's awesome I
forgot to mention one other concealer
this concealer is the dermablend
concealer in sable this is really
awesome at concealing any redness you
might have if you sort of had that
problem where it's just really read
certain spots then I definitely
recommend this concealer because it will
just camouflage it like that another
favorite of the year is just an obvious
obvious favorite this is the Make Up For
Ever matte velvet plus and I have this
in three shades I love it that much it's
just a beautiful beautiful foundation
and it looks very natural on the skin
it's just I mean I've talked about it so
many times so there's really no point in
me going until why I love it so much but
I love it definitely recommend it
especially if you have oily skin next
thing I want to talk about is this Mac
blush palette that I kind of created
just a lot of blushes in here I really
love I just want to shout out really
quick spring sheen this is a gorgeous
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous blush and
then the other one I love this year is
dolly mix I used to talk about this a
lot in the beginning of the year and I
still really really love this color so
Dalia mix and spring Sheen are my top
two favorites definitely for this year
and then also coming out of the NARS
they are Mari palette which I purchased
last year and this is still an awesome
value I'm super happy I was able to pick
it up last year but I talked to is in
that one right there sort of like a
mommy color oh my gosh excuse my nails -
and then um orgasm also those two pin my
favorite I just love them and this was a
great value this was like $60 and
usually like their individual blushes
retail for I think it's 28 so that's a
steal moving on to liners first one I
want to talk about is this L'Oreal hip
eyeliner this is just one that I like to
put on my waterline and the first time I
ever used it I did not like it when I
actually mentioned it in my liners video
months and months back I talked about
how much I didn't like it but I've been
loving it I think it's an amazing liner
for your waterline it's hard for me
find a liner that doesn't smudge like
the Urban Decay 24/7 that smudges on my
waterline on the Tarte one smudges on my
waterline it's hard to find one that
doesn't and I feel like this is the best
one I have found and it is from the
drugstore which is awesome so definitely
check that out if you're interested and
then liquid liners we have the
Maybelline Line stiletto this has
actually been a favorite in the past
couple months this is just a beautiful
liner and I really really really really
like it this one does have like a sponge
tip it's not necessarily a felt tip it's
more of a sponge type but it's really
easy to work with and I love it and then
the one I used before that that is still
a great liner if you're interested is
this Rimmel exaggerate eyeliner it's a
very very very black liner
I just haven't used this in a minute
because I've been distracted by other
liners that I keep buying but that's
what it looks like and this one does
have a filter okay now we're talking
about my scares and I have four that I
want to mention let me just go ahead and
say covergirl has really impressed me
this year from their mascaras to
foundations I've been trying out lately
they have been coming out with a bunch
of great stuff and things I haven't
tried and I just decided to try I love
from them so I definitely recommend
covergirl if you kind of on the fence
about buying stuff from them because I
feel like they stepped up their game a
lot this year so definitely definitely
check them out but the first three
mascaras don't talk about our all from
covergirl the first one is my all-time
favorite this is the covergirl lash
perfection mascara this is just what it
looks like we all know I love this one
and then another one is the covergirl
LashBlast volume amazing mascara and
then the covergirl and then they
covergirl clump crusher is also another
favorite I love these mascaras I think
they're just amazing and none of their
mascaras clump on me so that's awesome
and then the last mascara wanna talk
about is this L'Oreal collagen infused
mascara whatever it's called it has like
a huge huge name but this is just what
it looks like it's a very black and
volumizing mascara so if you're looking
for something like that then you would
definitely want to check this out I also
have a mess
Scarah team using these these three so
if you're interested in seeing that I'll
link it down below okay next I want to
talk about is the Maybelline Dream matte
powder I'm obsessed with this this
doesn't apply a lot of coverage but it
makes my skin so Matt and look flawless
this is basically a blotting powder so
if I'm getting oily throughout the day
this is what I'll use the color I have
mine in is medium zero once and so again
that's what it looks like I totally
recommend this product it's one of the
best powders ever literally I'm not even
kidding
moving onto eyeshadows we're almost done
I promise I have a wet and wild vanity
palette this is just a kind of thing I
love this palette so much I haven't
really been talking about it a lot
throughout the year but I've always said
this is definitely one of the best
palettes went round as ever came out
with you can actually get these on
beauty joy calm I will leave that link
down below they have the vanity the
greed one which is also another great
palette and they have lust and I do
believe another one but they do have
these palettes if you are interested
next palette is burp Urban Decay Naked
palette I purchased this this year and I
love it best purchase ever I've talked
about it in so many videos so many
favorites videos I mean this bad boy is
just a whole over my YouTube I love it
so much another palette is my Mac
palette I just want to say that I don't
have a specific color that I love from
my Mac palette these are just random
colors I picked out like um we have
carbon um I do believe this one is this
one's Brun saddle antiqued Omega
expensive pink expresso and then this is
a newer one I forget what it's called
but Sam actually got it for me I'm
actually wearing out my eyes today but I
just want to say Mac shadows are the
best I mean I love Urban Decay like my
Naked palette is amazing but the blend
ability of these
are the ones that I personally have is
just amazing this Mac is my favorite
brand for eyeshadows and every time I go
back to this palette it just reminds me
of why I spend the 15 dollars on an
eyeshadow and it's because it's amazing
so I just I mean I love Mac eyeshadows
alright moving on to makeup brushes this
is an obvious Sigma brushes I have been
meaning to make a video on these for so
long I actually filmed back when I was
blond like a few months ago I filled in
the video on how I wash my brushes I
just filmed the clip of me watching them
and I have been meaning and meaning and
meaning to them a clip to go before that
so I promise I will try to get that out
this month or January I'm gonna try my
best to get that out and talk more about
these brushes but they have been the
best things I've ever purchased mine
have not shed at all they still are
super soft they keep their shape I mean
they're amazing I use them in basically
all of my videos so Sigma brushes for
the win and I also have like the kabuki
face set as well which I will leave
those links down below if you're
interested but also I know the mr. bunny
brushes are pretty expensive but they do
have a travel size so I'll also leave
the travel kit down below as well
because I know they're super expensive
and there's really not a huge difference
between a regular and the travel size
other than the travel sizes have smaller
handles so I mean that's no big deal
but I definitely recommend these brushes
if you have not checked out Sigma at
least purchase one brush and see how you
like it because they're all just amazing
alright to hair products I want to shout
out first one I've almost finished this
up it's the healthy 60 hair soit
right-wing soy try wheat leave-in
conditioner this bad boy it's almost
gone I use it every single day when I
was blonde when I dyed my hair brown I
mean I still use it I love it it makes
my hair super soft and shiny and just
feel really really healthy I love this
stuff it's amazing this is a big bottle
and I'm trying to use this up and then
the last hair product I want to talk
about is this 12 benefits spray I use
this when I was blonde like I said I
still use it now it really just I mean
it's the best thing I've ever tried I
got
ten dollars from my stylist and it's an
instant healthy hair treatment and you
can use this in the summertime it helps
with like sun damage and stuff like that
it helps a wind damage
I mean this is an all year round product
so I mean I love the love of the stuff
and I'm almost done with this bottle as
well and I have a backup thank the Lord
last two favorites are fragrances first
one I want to talk about is Victoria's
Secret Angel perfume got this last
Christmas I do believe and I think it's
really awesome these two I must show you
or this one and the other one about show
you have been the two I've been using
all year and this one it's almost used
up super super sadly but I'm excited to
get this used up because I've had this
for two years now it's a big bottle and
as a Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy as you
can see I have a little bit left I'm
proud that I have used this up but this
has been a constant scent that I've
sprayed home myself throughout the year
and I'm definitely gonna repurchase
another one I'm just gonna repurchase a
smaller one because I had this one for
so long and they actually for Christmas
got the Jimmy Choo perfume which I'm
obsessing over how definitely get the
smaller one of this but this is an
amazing amazing fragrance I mean
everybody raves about this product it's
that awesome I forgot to mention one
more thing or two more things and their
lip products the first lip product is
the Revlon soft nude lipsticks I've
heard from a few of you guys that they
are discontinuing this lipstick which is
absolutely insane because that's like
the dumbest thing ever because this is
the best nude I feel like at the
drugstore
even the Rimmel has come out with a good
one but this one is still really nice as
well and I think it's just amazing so
that's really sad that they're
discontinuing that so I definitely
recommend going and picking it up today
this is a perfect drugstore nude I've
never seen a nude like this before in
the drugstore and then last one is a lip
gloss from the drugstore this is the NYX
lip glosses sugarpie this is a beautiful
nude lip gloss this has actually gotten
me on a lip gloss kick I started using
more lip gloss once I purchased this one
so that is it for my 2012 favorites I
hope you guys enjoyed it don't forget to
like the video if you did and I hope you
guys have also had an amazing 2012 and a
blessed 2013 coming
I feel like it's gonna be a good year
but I kind of hope it goes by a little
bit slower than this year day cuz this
year was just like gone uh but yeah so
don't forget to keep an eye out for my
December favorites I'll be mentioning
some new products in that and thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see
you a minute video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
