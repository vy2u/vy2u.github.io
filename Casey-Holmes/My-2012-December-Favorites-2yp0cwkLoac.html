so obviously let's just get it over with
and talk about it I did dye my hair
darker I'm loving it I know a bunch of
you are missing the blonde hair but more
much more of you or loving the darker
hair I kind of was over like I loved my
hair before like when I first got it
dyed darker how I had like the blonde
and how I kind of faded and that ombre
kind of type thing but it was so tingly
like ever since I had gotten more blonde
underneath it was so tingly and it was
bothering me so bad and it started to
fade into like this weird brownish kind
of color on top and I didn't really like
it because my hair was so blonde you
know I expected it to fake pretty
quickly but I wanted to at least get a
stylist to make it darker before I
actually tried my by myself and I did
dye all this myself so the color that I
used is this L'Oreal technique
preference permanent hair color mega
browns in chocolate level 4
the bases are red and violet and you can
definitely definitely see the red and
violet like when the Sun hits it you can
really see it so this is what the bottle
looks like I did get it from Sally's
they're about six bucks a piece and I
got two bottles of this I was going to
film the process but I just got way too
nervous I was like watch me just go
ahead and mess up on camera and then
have all these people how that I suck it
actually turned out really good so I'm
really happy with it it feels so much
healthier like I can't even describe to
you how much healthier it feels and I'm
just loving it so I hope you guys like
it too because I'm loving it and I'm not
gonna be blonde for a while so this is
gonna be my December favorites I have
quite a bit of things to show you guys
so I'm just gonna go ahead and get
started
the first thing I actually meant to talk
about this last month but I forgot I've
been using this so much it's my favorite
curling one this is the new me three and
one so it comes with three barrels
32:25 and I do believe it's a 15
millimeter I never use that one because
I don't like really really tight curls
but I love this I use the 30 to the 25 a
lot now just interchange them the 32 has
been nice
right that is how I actually got these
really big voluminous curls I've just
ever since I posted a haul back in
September of November I had polka-dotted
a polka-dotted shirt on that's what I
used and I've been using it ever since
and I love this curling wand it's
amazing so if you are interested in this
curling wand I'll put a link down below
and of course if you caught a coupon
code because I always have one down
there for them and it's always a really
good discount by the way so definitely
check that out next favorites are these
sinful loose glitters I have to go pick
up more because these are amazing if you
saw my Instagram picture my nails are
looking really jacked up right now but
if you saw my Instagram picture of my
glitter nails for New Year's Eve this is
what I used
it's from simple colors you can use this
on your eyes on your nails whatever you
want to do with it it's fine it's
beautiful I think this starry sky one's
a great dupe for makeup forever halogen
powder that was actually limited edition
so I don't know if it's still available
but this is a great dupe for it it's
actually kind of liked it better because
that is so iridescent and like the
colors just you have purples greens
yellows oranges I mean it's a beautiful
color so I definitely recommend checking
these out I definitely go pick up more
and they're super cheap
I know simple colors is usually a nail
polish kind of thing kind of brand they
have been coming out with lip glosses
and stuff like that so definitely check
them out it's pretty cool next I want to
shout out my favorite liner for the
month I've been just obsessed with it
this is a Maybelline line stiletto I
talk about this all the time I think
it's just the perfect liquid liner I
actually like it more than the precise
one the Maybelline precise liquid liner
I don't know this one just sits better
for my oily lids next favorite is a new
one that I have been just raving about
ever since I got it it's the covergirl
and Olay simply ageless corrector so
this is what it looks like this is the
best product ever to put underneath your
eyes it just kind of has like a swirl of
a white color and like a skin tone type
color or the corrector and all I do is
just take my finger and it makes it
I've had it underneath my eyes before I
even put any concealer on and it
completely brightens and lightens my
under-eye and it really corrects any
dark circles anything like that I've
been using it every single day since
I've purchased it and I got because I
heard love Melissa Michelle always
talked about it but I knew it was really
kind of expensive in the drugstore so I
didn't want to go and like splurge on it
um just randomly but I ended up going
one day and I was like oh just buy it
and I've been obsessed with it and I'll
never not purchase it because it's
awesome and then what I use to put on
top of it just kind of have a skin tone
concealer on top is this maybelline
instant age rewind erased arc circle and
light pale I talked about this a lot
definitely one of my favorite cousin
sealers to use and I've used quite a bit
of it next is the lipstick I discover it
was kind of a little bit later in the
month of December but I have been using
it like crazy this is max creme de nude
it's just a beautiful beautiful nude
color and I love it
it's my favorite nude at the moment I've
loved it so much I use it all the time
and I have it on my lips and I actually
have it on with Fleur abundance from Mac
and this is also another favorite but I
got this at the very end of December
next favorite is my wet and wild vanity
palette this has been my go-to palette
for work if I just want a really quick I
look I will go to this palette and I
love it it's perfect easy to use and I
just put like this in the crease and one
of these two in the outer V and
underneath my lower lash line and I'm
done and I'll use this one as a
highlight of course but it's one of the
best palettes ever just to kind of go to
for a quick I look something neutral and
definitely great for work so love this
and you can get at cherry culture and
what's the other one
beauty joy to COMSOL put those in the
bottom bar as well next is a blush I've
been using this blush like nobody's
business
it is from the balm and it's called down
boy and it's just a really nice if I can
get it open just a really nice Mabi pink
color I love it for the winter it's
beautiful and it's just amazing and it
actually stays on very very well and you
can use it as a shadow or blush
I mean it's a huge freakin size so
that's awesome
I love them and I always like to catch
them when they're on HauteLook for a
discounted price next product I want to
talk about is this Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer I have used this every
single day since I've gotten it
literally I will not be surprised
whenever I hit pan on it because I've
used it so much and I just I love it
that's what it looks like it's a really
nice matte bronzer it just looks like a
really good contour I love this so much
I will continue to repurchase this for
as long as I can
it smells like chocolate and it's just a
beautiful beautiful bronzer it's not
orangie or anything like that and if
you're wondering I've been using no new
brushes to contour with this one I
actually rediscovered I use it all the
time a few months ago and then I kind of
forgot about it so I had no more brushes
for bronzer and I had to use this one
it's the Sedona least FBO three I love
using this one just to kind of buff in
bronzer to kind of have a contour or
just bronze my face then if I want a
really strong contour I'll show you guys
these haven't shown you I actually got
these for Christmas
they're the Sephora brand brushes and
they're in this cute little Sephora um I
don't know what you would call this like
stand and it has like a little specks of
glitter and it's s áfourá
cuz it's so cute brushes and they're
really really nice but I've been using
the brush from there and this is for
contouring as well and that's just what
it looks like just a nice small dome
shaped brush and it's super cute
lightweight it's really easy just to get
a strong contour and I love it so it's
my favorite brush at the moment okay so
we have another bronzer and this one's
on the drugstore side I was actually out
and about and I was like oh my god I
need another bronzer cuz we're gonna go
out and they want to buy a high-end one
because I already had one at home so I
went to a drugstore and I picked up this
NYC sunny bronzer and I hear so many
people talk about this all the time so I
had to pick it up and I really liked it
just to kind of give yourself a nice
bronze look to your face I think it's
beautiful and I definitely think this is
a great drugstore product if you're a
little too heavy with it it will look
orange but I mean it's great to just
bronze up your face and kind of give you
a warm complexion so I loved that I
tagged a few more products left first
one I want to talk about is I have been
filling in my brows a little
but I don't know if you can really tell
maybe you can I don't know but I've been
using this Milani brow fix and Oh to
medium
that's just what it looks like I just
randomly decided pick this up and I act
through all the brushes away other than
this little guy this little angled guy
but I like to use the brow one color I'm
not huge on having super statement
eyebrows that's just not my thing and I
don't really like my eyebrows to
actually match my hair because it just
looks odd to me personally so I'll use
brow one it's just the perfect color to
fill in and it doesn't look like fake
eyebrows it looks like my eyebrows just
thicker so I have been really really
really really loving that next is a
mascara this is a Maybelline Rocket
Volume Mascara a lot have you seen this
in my FIF video which I'll link in the
bottom bar but I love this it gives my
lashes so much volume and actually have
it today if you can see I mean it's just
the bomb I do have half lashes on
because I've been really enjoying half
lashes but this is awesome and I use it
every single day I really quickly want
to talk about some shades from my Mac
palette the first one is I think this
one's brown script yes first one I want
to talk about these are the colors I've
been using and I have them on today I
mean I'd be using them like crazy so we
have the color saddle I've been using
that in my crease I've been mixing Brown
script and Brun so I've been mixing
those twos and put them in my outer
corner and putting them into my crease
and then I've also been taking expresso
and putting this on my lower lash line
and I just love the combo they're all
matte and they all look super cool we're
just together I now have two hair
products and a body product first hair
product you guys saw this in my last
haul I did this is a big sexy hair root
pump I'm obsessed with this I have
really flat hair like when I blow dry it
will be really really flat I'll put this
in my hair will kind of sit in a towel
for a little bit and then I'll take it
out and I'll rub this into my roots and
blow-dry my hair like
side down and like the opposite way that
the hair falls this gives me some volume
I am Ken like it is the bomb and it
makes my hair just so much more volume
eyes I use it almost every day and it's
just perfect I love this product if you
have really flat hair I would definitely
recommend checking this out who you guys
know I'm obsessed with dry shampoos so
I'm obsessed with this one it's the
batiste dry shampoos the hint of dark or
hint of color for dark and deep brown
hair when I knew I was going to dye my
hair darker when I was blonde I went
ahead and I bought two of these and I'm
almost done with this one I'm obsessed
with it I used to use the regular one
when I was blonde like right one right
before I went brunette I ordered the
regular one when I was blonde and I
loved it so that's why I decide this one
up it's amazing it especially the color
treat the color tinted one so if you
have darker hair it's not going to show
like as bad unless you sit there and
like spray it directly on your roots it
looks amazing and really makes your hair
look refreshed and it doesn't smell bad
at all it smells good so you can kind of
see how it is tinted right there I love
this product I recommend ad I think it's
like what eight bucks at Ulta not too
sure last product I want to talk about
is this soap &amp;amp; Glory righteous body
butter this is the balm I have really
dry skin at the moment and I've actually
had for a couple months now but this is
really really helped me I've been using
it everyday this is the very dry skin
formula
I also got this in my haul oh it smells
so good but you can see how much I've
used of this product I mean it's we're
getting down to the nitty-gritty here so
I love this product I definitely
recommend it if you have really dry skin
so those were all my favorites for the
month of December I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and yes thank you
guys so much for watching don't forget
to like it if you liked it and I will
see you guys in my next video bye mmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
