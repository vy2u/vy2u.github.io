fairway favorites I'm excited to do
because I have a lot of stuff to show
you something to go ahead and get into
it
the first thing I want to show you is
something I did a review on a couple
videos back like two videos back of fat
and it's the got to be powerful I do
have this in my hair now and I'm
seriously in love with it it's amazing
and just adds so much fun into my hair
you definitely check out the review I
will link it down below if you're
interested next thing is something else
I did a review on and it's the Jamaica
catwalk eye kit and this is just the
colors I really love them I've been
using this a ton lately it's what I have
on my eyes today I love it it's so
convenient so easy to turn to and I just
love the color so love that next is a
nail polish now my nails are bare
because I kind of got lazy
um they were really chipped like super
bad but I decided just to take them off
let him have a breather and the podge
I've been using or I was using the whole
month is cool vibe from Milani so like
purple with a pink undertone it's a very
pretty
next we're gonna do concealers and then
when I like to I'm not wearing
foundation is the Revlon age defying
concealer and medium I love it super
creamy easy to blend down and so it just
covers up so nicely so I love this and
the next one is when I use in my
foundation and everything and it's my
cement MACT select cover-up and this
isn't a W 30 I love it covers amazingly
it's just a really great concealer next
are two blushes I've really been into
kind of a rosy cheek lately um I have to
put this in I put it in my last
favorites video believe and I had to
mention it again and it's Mac's dolly
mix a very gorgeous color I'm like
obsessed with it it is a sheer tone
shimmer but it's like a not overpowering
shimmer so it's a very pretty color the
next one is probably my favorite
drugstore blush should always turn back
to it like I find a just a quick pretty
blush I get this one and it's spicy and
sweet by heart candy this stuff has
really good color payoff and it's just a
really pretty color so that's it right
there
this is my foundation I did my
foundation routine with this one which I
will also link down below
the number Seven's a perfect foundation
I love it this I mentioned in my January
favorites as well I'm definitely gonna
have to pick it up like the full size
because this is a sample size but I have
been absolutely in love with it and it's
the Estee Lauder substance extreme
mascara has a really huge wand and the
formula is just fantastic make sure
lashes super thick black just amazing so
I am in love with this stuff it's
amazing with any mascara or if you just
want to use it on it on its own it looks
fantastic
and it's also my favorite looks amazing
by itself as well
it's the Maybelline one by one mascara I
used to use this a while back and then I
don't know I'd never picked it back up
again I'm not sure why but it didn't so
I said I'd pick it up when I was at the
store again and I was still right back
in love with it so I've been using this
non-stop as well but for the sticks I
have two they're both from Mac I have a
perfect day I don't remember which
collection this was from it just
literally went so this one's a perfect
day really nice nude color that's it
right there and then this one's from the
shop cook shop matte collection and this
is in a sense beware see if I can do it
this way yeah and this is like the best
nude ever it's so stinkin pretty and
kind of looks like the blush but it's
definitely just so gorgeous I love it
next is an eyeshadow I've been using
Carvin like nobody's business I mention
this in my January favorites as well
this has to be my favorite black
eyeshadow ever so had to mention that
next is this great lash from Maybelline
clear transparent like I guess you call
it a gel thing I use these for my brows
I have really coarse eyebrows and I
don't like to turn my eyebrows a lot
because they're already thin so I don't
want to make them of a pair even more
thin because I don't like to fill in my
eyebrows or anything like that so this
really keeps them in place locks them
down and like I don't have any crazy
looking eyebrows throughout the day so I
love this and I haven't film this is
gonna ask me forever so next is the
eyeliner and I got this one ride a was
having a sale and it's the NYC liquid
liner
it's in black just looks like that it's
a very pigmented liner super black
really nice of a worn that's every day
this month next is the bronzer of course
ahead to mention NARS Casino I'm hitting
major pan on it I need to start using my
day Maury palette because I know
whenever I run out of this I'm gonna go
to a Sephora and I really don't want to
go because then I know I'll buy like a
new foundation from NARS a new powder
cuz I ran out of all my stuff so
hopefully this will last me a little bit
longer have two powders and the first
one is when I set my concealer with and
you guys have seen us and it's the elf
High Definition powder puffs this stuff
I like it for especially for the price
is like three bucks and this is my
powder I've been using every single day
I love it
and it's the cover tops-10 powder from
Physicians Formula and it's in
transparent medium and you could kind of
see I don't know if you can see but I
made a huge dent in this so I love this
stuff and I totally recommend it with
this foundation they just both work so
well together I'm in love
let's the victoy secret summer bombshell
perfume and that was from a last summer
I have the body spray and I've had it
since last summer but I didn't pick up
the perfume and then I went on Amazon
and looked it up and I found it bought
it ever since I got it in like the
middle of February I've been using it
absolutely non-stop I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I have a lot more
coming and I will see you all in my next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
