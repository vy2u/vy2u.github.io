my October favorites now really quickly
I wanted to do a quick intro and first
off say I'm sorry for not putting up a
video this week I've been so busy and
just there's been so many things going
on but also I just wanted to mention
that anyone who is affected by Hurricane
sandy I know it was such a horrible
storm it really just demolished a lot of
things and it was just it's devastating
to see because I couldn't imagine
something like that happening to my
hometown I just want to quickly say that
you guys are my prayer I did donate to
three different places the Red Cross the
Salvation Army and the Humane Society if
you're interested in donating anything I
will put everything in the bottom bar
because every little bit really
seriously does go a long way so if you
could take even just like $2 of your
money and just donate it that'd be great
umm because anything can help okay so
let's get started with the favorites the
first is pallets I have to mention thing
I'm gonna start with a Z palette first I
love this palette so much I got on
Amazon for $20 and you probably already
know about this because this has been
around for a very long time but I love
it I just got the regular black one
because I think black is nice and sleep
I just depotted a bunch of thing this is
another favorite right here the who
would benefit bronzer I'm using that so
much this month but this palette is
great I love it it's definitely created
a bunch of space in my you know little
makeup drawers all of these palettes
like putting everything in here there's
just so much more space now and I'm so
happy but I will put a link to this down
below where you can get it and I also
put like a piece of paper on the back
and wrote down which blush was which
most people probably won't like that but
I really don't care cuz I like to know
what's there now you always do like
labels on the back if you want to or on
the pan but I'm not worried about it so
that's my first favorite and then the
hoola benefit bronzer is definitely a
favorite as well and then of course
another palette this is my Mac blush
palette and the blush I've been really
loving this month there's two the first
one is spring sheen and that's what it
looks like this is definitely a
beautiful beautiful blush I can't even
get over how pre this is it just looks
great great for everyday use and
I'm so happy I purchased it because it
is just a beautiful color and it is a
sheer toned shimmer I do believe so I
love that and this palette I love it and
then the last thing is this matte
palette now I saw on Samantha Dee I
think it's Riley I'm probably saying
that wrong but her video she didn't want
a while back on the comparison between
the Z palette in this palette the new
one from Mac I was on the hunt for this
for so long I tried to go in my Mac or I
tried to go in my Macy's to my Mac and
get it they didn't have it you have to
get it in a Mac store which is like an
hour away from me and they don't have
them online yet but I didn't know that
until I went and talked to Samantha and
because her video was really great I
actually link it down below but she was
so kind and sent this to me and I was so
thrilled to get it I'm in love with it
she was so so sweet so thank you say on
that was really sweet of you and done
this one looks like it's just so sleek
now if you don't know the other Mac
palettes are just like this um which
they are really nice too but I think
this is so pretty you could see the
colors and it's just a really nice sleek
palette and it's really nicely made and
then also she bought my first eyeshadow
for if you follow me on Instagram and
Twitter you probably already know this
and this is the one that she bought I do
believe this is brown script and I'm
actually wearing it today I love this
palettes have been like a huge thing for
me this month they've created so much
space and I actually go to these shadows
more and blushes now that they're in a
palette and I kind of just have them out
and ready to use so I've really been
loving that another blush I want to
mention is this matte form so blush this
is a mineralized blush and I've been
using this like crazy as well it is just
so beautiful and it's another great
everyday blush it's on my middle finger
if you can tell but it is so so pretty I
think it looked great on any skin tone
just kind of adds a nice shade of color
to your skin I really love it so I
definitely recommend that one okay so
next favorite is foundation and I
actually have been using these everyday
in this month is the makeup forever
matte velvet plus foundation I have mine
in 40 and 35 35 is when I'm not as tan
and 40 is when I've like just self tan
and the day after but I love these so
much they leave the most flawless finish
to your skin I still love my Revlon
Colorstay liquid foundation but there's
just a huge difference between drugstore
in high-end and I don't know I've just
been loving me so much I definitely
recommend these if you're in the market
for a more of a high-end foundation and
then I want to mention this powder I I
think I talked about this my last
favorites I can't remember but I love
this powder the Maybelline Dream matte
powder mine's in medium 0-1 sand and I
actually hit pan on it this month so I
was really excited about that
this is the powder I take with me on the
go everywhere so it's always my purse
and I really really love it there have
been three polishes this month that I
love the first one is this wet and wild
polish and private viewing this is
definitely a really nice nude polish if
you're looking for one and they're only
about a dollar ninety-nine next one is
SES miss fancy-pants this is another
gorgeous color for fall I really really
really like this one a lot and then the
next one's my SC as well and this is in
Aruba blue I've been wearing this on my
toes like crazy I really love it
I've said it before it's just the
perfect blue ever and it's just so
pretty so next is lip products and if
you've been watching my videos this
month do you probably have been able to
tell that I have been loving buried
colored lips and literally they're just
amazing I love them so the first one is
Revlon's crush this is such a gorgeous
balm stain and it's just the prettiest
color so that's crushed right there and
it's so easy to dispose in your purse
and put it on your lips and go it's just
so so easy
also Revlon lip butter and sugar plum
and love this one this one's really
really nice so that's it right there and
also the last one is CoverGirl's
euphoria and that's it on the very end
very very very pretty color then I look
liner I've been using with all them is
this
joël lip liner which again I love it
and that's it
on the very bottom so if you want to see
these on I have a few videos I think I
have yeah I have one video for a
lipstick like I'm wearing at least one
of these colors in some of my videos so
if you're wondering what they look like
on and just check out my previous ones
from this month because I wore them all
so as a lot of you already know I do
self tan and exfoliating is a huge huge
part in self-tanning you have to make
sure you do it or it'll catch on to like
dry patches of your skin and it will
just look crazy and a bunch of color
will attach there and it look horrible
so I have found the best exfoliator for
me it is so freakin awesome I love it
it's this prestige wonder polish and
this one's in sweet orange tangerine
think I read that right ok that's what
it is it says dead sea salt and mineral
pact benefits for an intoxicating good
scrub I definitely agree this is awesome
it leaves your skin so smooth that's
what it looks like you don't need a lot
at all I'll just take a little bit and
I'll rub it all over like my arms and my
legs and my stomach and everything and
it's really nice it's very grainy it's
not too harsh so I really love it the
smell I could go about but it's like it
is definitely a tangerine type of smells
but I could totally live with the smell
because it's really great and it makes
like my skin super smooth and it's great
for self-tanner because it just supplies
so so smoothly and just glides on like
butter I have another favorite but I
can't find it I literally just push on
like I used it for this morning when I
was doing my makeup and I can't find it
anywhere I showed it in a previous haul
I'll link it down below but it's the
makeup forever transparent loose powder
it's in transparent natural I do believe
and it is amazing I love it I use it
every single day I actually use it to
set my foundation also I use it
underneath my eyes whenever I apply
concealer and it's just been phenomenal
I love it love it love it so much now
for brushes I love my Sigma brushes I
have the Sigma mr. bunny set though on
black
those are my favorite but I just really
cooking lunch I'll use two brushes cuz I
have been using them all the time and
you have to excuse them because yes they
are dirty I don't get around washing my
brushes a lot so I'm sorry and I use
them every day this is the Sigma flat
angled kabuki the f88 I love this brush
for foundation I'm pretty sure I mention
it last month as well so so amazing the
application is just insane it just buffs
your foundation so well into your skin
it just leaves this nice flawless finish
and it doesn't look cakey or anything
like that and I just love it
I love this brush I'll put the link for
this these two brushes and my the set
that I have also but the last one is
this little baby and it's the Sigma
precision flat angled p88
and that's what looks like it's
basically like that last brush I showed
you but just smaller has that really
nice sharp edge I love this for
under-eye concealer I never thought
about like a brush to apply my under-eye
concealer but I've been using this every
day this month for my under eyes and it
is just phenomenal bun these two are in
my face routine every single day so I
love them if you're interested like I
said check the bottom bar so that's
pretty much it for all my favorites so
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
