another favourites video so of course
I'll be doing mine for the month of
April I have a lot of new products for
you guys getting care hair stuff like
that I think you all will really enjoy
so if you're interested in seeing all of
my new favorites for the month then just
keep watching ok the first thing is my
new skincare routine I've been doing
lately and I went out and bought new
products because I the clean and clear
stuff really breaks me out and it's been
really difficult for me to find
something that's really working on my
skin lately I decided to pick up some
Aveeno products and the first thing is
the Aveeno clear complexion daily
cleansing pads and this is what the
little thingy looks like I couldn't even
think of what it look like and it's a
really huge little jar and you get 28
self-filming pads and this has salicylic
acid um treatment stuff in it and it
gently exfoliates to clear even looking
skin it does exfoliate it has an
exfoliating site and then the softer
side and I love it it just I don't know
the exfoliation part I didn't think it
would be really exfoliating because it
was just kind of like a little pad but
it really does take off I haven't heard
about it really does take off the dead
skin and then once I exfoliate I turn
Pat over and I just buff over my face
and then usually I do this before I get
in the shower and then I'll get in the
shower and wash my face again so when i
do that i use the oh gosh i have makeup
all over this the Aveeno positively
radiant and skin brightening daily scrub
and this is what that looks like I
really love this as well it is super
great for my skin all these products
smell really good and they are natural
so I really like it
these been really working and I'm going
to do a skin care routine soon just to
kind of show you what I do exactly what
my regimen is now that I finally got one
that I really love I will be showing you
guys so this is my new favorite
conditioner it is in need of damage
therapy intensive repair conditioner
this is so amazing
my fiancé's sister had this in her
shower and I started using it and
I used up all her so I had to go fast
another one I really love it it says up
to 95 percent fewer split ends I believe
that this is an amazing conditioner I
even loved it more than like the red can
I think it's called all soft shampoo
conditioner stuff this is amazing it
leaves my hair so soft so I really
really love this another product for my
skin care is definitely the B or a deep
cleansing poor strips
I use these on my nose I was gonna get
the forehead one but then I just decided
not to but these are really great too
you get at eight nose strips per thing
and I leave mine on for probably about
ten minutes if that because it gets so
hard so quickly and like I'll start
peeling it off and it hurts so bad so
you have to damp it a little bit with
the water if you leave it on too long so
it helps it come off easier now I have
not gonna break out all my nose at all
and I think this is so cool cuz I'm
really weird and I like to look at stuff
and see like what was in my skin or
whatever does anybody else like that cuz
I'm like that but you can look at the
little on the little strip and you can
see what was like in your pores so you
know it's working and I really love it
so I highly highly recommend these and
now they have like a little rewards
program where you can go sign up online
so every time you buy this you can kind
of get rewards and stuff for it next
thing is this pink
fresh vanilla feel flirty softening body
butter this is from Victoria's Secret I
really love this it's the best-smelling
thing ever and I just OH I don't know
this is like the best body butter I've
ever tried because it's not too greasy
or anything like that is really
moisturizing and it has definitely been
one of my favorites
okay next is the so sexy smooth straight
silky styling mist it conditions for
heat styling protection and frizz free
styles this is also from Victoria's
Secret I've had it for a while but then
I kind of just got back into it I had
about that much left I'm going to like
the whole bottle but I sprayed this
before I blow dry my hair so when it's
wet and all of the Victoria Secret hair
products smells so good I need to go
back and pick myself up the shampoo and
conditioner
because it was so amazing and I don't
know why I ever stopped using but
anyways this is amazing it's $14 I know
they have little specials there for
their haircare stuff I think it's like
three for 25 or something like that but
that's a great deal because these are
amazing amazing products so I highly
recommend this ok I think it's the last
well second last hair care pot well this
last hair care product and it is a
nourishing coconut milk this is a little
serum that they have I got this at CVS
for like 6 bucks I think I really love
this I think it's the only thing I liked
from organics because it actually does
what it says but it does leave my end
super silky and smooth and I'm just so
in love with it ok so the last hair
product is a hair tool and it's
obviously the goody wave creator I do
have a review on this if you want to see
it I will link it down below this is
second day hair from it and I absolutely
love it I just I love the fact that the
curls stay pretty well I mean I still do
touch-ups like along the top of my head
cuz you know sometimes I just have to do
that but this is such an amazing tool I
love it so much I just love the waves
that it creates and especially when you
sleep on it and wake up in the morning
of the outcome of it I've been using it
a ton you'll be singing a ton of my
videos coming up as well just because
I'm obsessed ok so now going on to make
that stuff which you guys are really
into I've definitely been using the
maybelline instant age rewind it a dark
circle concealer I'm in honey this has
definitely been just an easy thing to
throw underneath my eyes in the morning
and go I think it's really really great
so I've been using that a lot
another concealer is the Sonia Kashuk
hidden agenda concealer the only one
I've been using a lot in this is the
green one because I'm absolutely
obsessed with it I haven't really
experimented with the other ones yet
they're just a little too creamy for my
oily skin but the green one is just
amazing at cancelling out my redness
though I really like that next is this
NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk this is
what I used to kind of like go in the
inner corner of my eye and like
before I put a light eyeshadow there and
it is really great I'm just obsessed
with it and like this makeup I have on
today it's been like my all-time new
favorite thing so this has been in my
routine doing this if you want to makeup
tutorial on it let me know I just I'm in
love with it okay so the next product
that I also have in my eyes today is the
Maybelline Color tattoo this is an bad
to the bronze and I was so pretty I'm
just obsessed with us I've been starting
to use this a little bit more and just
really really enjoying it next along
with those two things I've been using
expresso by Mac which is just a dark
matte brown just to kind of put it in
the crease and deepen it up a little bit
and this has been an amazing eye shadow
I just love Mac eye shadows I think
they're they will always be one of my
favorite brands for eyeshadows and of
course I have to include my NARS sheer
matte foundation I have it on today
it's just really amazing and I love the
finish you all know so I'm not gonna
jabber on about it but this is
definitely had to be in my March or
April favorites I keep saying March and
then less makeup product is this NYX
blush and it is in silky rose it is so
pretty I just I love this color
that's a swatch of it and that's just
the color it is such a pretty color and
I'm absolutely in love with it so okay
so my last three favorites are pretty
simple the first one is the nail posh I
wore in my last video and you guys are
asking a lot of questions about it it's
the Sally Hansen extreme wear color or
whatever and it's in Coral Reef and if
you're wondering when I have on my nails
right now it is Sally Hansen extreme
wear and white on I have to repaint them
because I went a little chipping crazy
and I started messing with it I don't
know but I've been using Coral Reef a
lot this month on my toes and my nails
everything and then my last favorites
are these travel O's I'm gonna have a
review on them but I am so obsessed this
one has my viva la juicy perfume in it
and
one has my Victoria's Secret Angel
perfume and I love just keeping these in
my purse and going I just I'm obsessed
with it I love the packaging look at how
cute these are I just think they are so
stinking adorable yeah so those are my
favorites for the month of what is it
