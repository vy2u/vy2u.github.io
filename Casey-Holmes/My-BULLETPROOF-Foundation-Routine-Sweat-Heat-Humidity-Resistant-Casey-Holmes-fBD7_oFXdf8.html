showing you all of my favorite products
to use for bullet proof foundation
routine I also included eyebrow and this
as well like what I've been using to
really keep my brows in place I wanted
to focus mainly on the face if you have
really oily skin I hope this video helps
you out a lot I have super oily skin and
I sweat a lot like my face sweats so
much during the summer time that
sometimes I'm like keva Botox in my face
to help sweat not come out I mean I'm
over it so I mean I wouldn't do that
that's really scary and that would be a
lot of needles but anyways I will say
this is a pretty high-end foundation
routine but all of these products are
hands-down amazing the best products I
have used in a really long time the
combination of all of them really just
helps a makeup stay on all day nothing
is making it budge so if you want to see
how I get this long wearing a
bulletproof sweat proof humidity proof
foundation routine keep on washing
washing or watching not enough ok so the
first thing we're going to do is apply
this Too Faced hangover RX no matter how
oily your skin is you still want to make
sure you properly moisturize so this is
really good to use if you've already
done your morning skincare and you want
to let that sit for a while and then
move on to a makeup so now I'm going to
use this makeup forever skin equalizer
and number one this is a mattifying one
I think it's the step one actually but I
did use a little too much so a little
bit does go a long way with this product
and I would only recommend putting it in
the areas you get super oily so for me
that's always in the t-zone and then
we're moving on to foundation these two
are by far my favorite the Lancome 24
blah blah blah it's a long name the
Estee Lauder Double Wear and four
drugstore the Loreal Pro matte is really
nice
if you've been watching me for a really
long time you know Estee Lauder is my
holy grail Estee Lauder where is what
I'm using a right now on my face in this
video I've actually spilt water on my
face which sounds really weird but I
have and it does not budge this
foundation this it just doesn't budge
it's perfect for these summer months
I'm just if you have oily skin you need
it in your life
now I'm going to be using a new mac
prolongwear concealer I personally find
this is the best lightweight full
coverage long wearing concealer out
there
hence the reasons why it's called Pro
Longwear really great for oily skin I
don't think this makes me more oily I
actually think this helps keep my oil at
bay that's why I've used it for so long
I just really truly love it and think
it's by far the best concealer ever and
a little bit goes a long way with it so
you have a lot to work with
I'm just putting some concealer on my
nose to highlight you don't have to do
this part but I always make sure I do it
and then moving on to this Marc Jacobs
palette I love this I'm going to be
taking the banana shade and setting my
under eyes and everything with oily skin
you really want to make sure you set
everything in place and I find that this
Marc Jacobs palette is really amazing at
keeping everything locked and in place
in and not moving
and then I'm gonna take this G washi
powder oh my gosh you guys this patter
is amazing I like to dot it all over my
face like this
with the sponge and I think it's funny
because the G's are all over my face and
then blend it out with a brush this
stuff is so matte and it makes you look
air brushed you need this in your life
if you have oily skin I keep it in my
purse with me at all times so now I'm
moving on to bronzer I'm using a makeup
for everyone again this is a very
long-lasting bronzer and it's not too
dark it just adds enough warmth for me
and I'm going back into the Marc Jacobs
palette using the contouring shade to
contour my face like I said earlier this
contour palette is really nice at
staying in place and just blasting all
night long a longevity of these products
are just phenomenal
now keep in mind you don't have to do
each and every one of these steps if you
want lighter makeup feel free to leave
some things out but when I'm doing a
really long wear makeup look I like to
do all of these and use these products
just to make sure everything is locked
in place not moving no matter what the
case may be
I'll tart has amazing blushes they have
a 12-hour wear and they're just so
beautiful and are really really easy to
work with I personally love this color I
think it's very universal it's called
captivating very beautiful peachy pink
color and like I said super easy to
blend out and these blushes last forever
and I think this blush looks really
great with any look and most importantly
don't forget to blend out all of your
makeup I like to use a duo fiber brush
but just make sure you blend it all now
and then moving on to Bobby Brown
highlighters this is in copper diamond I
believe this was a limited edition but I
love for highlighters again they do last
a really long time and I only like to
use powder highlighters because I'm
already going to start sweating
throughout the day and have a natural
glow to my skin so I just like to add a
little bit more to the tops of my
cheekbones and I'm done like I don't
want to do a liquid Luminizer because
it'll just end up being way too much for
me so I stick with powder highlight on
the tops of the cheekbones and I'm done
moving on to my long wearing brow
products this is a Tarte Amazonian clay
waterproof brow pencil I believe this is
in the color taupe I like this just to
fill in at the first portion of the
brows just so they're not super harsh
and they're like square brows we've all
seen bad brows and I have had bad brows
before we're not going to go there but
it's but it's happened it happens to the
best of us so I fill in my brows in the
beginning and then I use this Anastacio
dip brow pomade in taupe it's very very
easy to work with it do not be too
intimidated by it I know I was and I
didn't use it for the longest time just
because I was scared I was gonna overdo
my brows I work from my arch in and then
I just make sure I blend and spoolie up
my brows along the way you could just
see how easy it is I mean it takes me no
time to put this dip brow on and I'm
completely done the shape looks amazing
and I really do like the color as well
and I do put just a little bit on the
beginning of my brow to kind of finish
them off and this stuff lasts forever
this brow combo it's not moving it's
just so amazing highly highly highly
recommend them and then just to set them
in place make sure they are completely
bulletproof
Nastasia clear brow gel and you are all
set
