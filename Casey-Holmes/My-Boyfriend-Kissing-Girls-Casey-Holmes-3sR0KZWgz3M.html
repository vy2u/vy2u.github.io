a Q&amp;amp;A if my eyes look a little bit
watery at some points during this video
I'm not about to cry I cry like once a
year so I'm not about to cry
but I'm wearing a new eyeliner on my
waterline and it is driving me insane I
had to cover it with a black eyeliner
and like my eyes are super irritated by
it so that's why if they look a little
watery eyeliner props but if you guys
will see this makeup look because I
really like the way that it turned out
it's more purples and mauls and they
must be great for fall I know my thumb
cing up this video or leave a comment
down below whichever way you want to let
me know that you want to see this video
on this makeup look and also went
tomorrow for you guys as most of you
know I do have a boyfriend so I'm going
to keep those questions a rap about us
more towards the end and I'm going to
answer things about me in the beginning
of this video you know if you want to
stick around to hear more about my
relationship you can towards the end of
the video but I'm just going to look
through these comments and see what we
got the brita 79 asks what's your
favorite fast food meal and that is
definitely chick-fil-a I always go to
choose what I had to play tonight
actually um because I didn't have time
to like cook a meal because I wanted to
film like it has edited enough for you
guys and it's already 9:30 so if I were
to wait til after this video it would be
way too late to eat but I go to
chick-fil-a and what I order is the
number one which is the chicken sandwich
with no butter and no pickles and I get
a large diet coke with light ice every
single time I very rarely go out of that
sometimes I'll get like the grilled
chicken but it's just not as good as the
number one Iona
X dream asks what is the scariest dream
dream you've ever had now I can't
remember like the scariest dream I've
ever had
I really told you guys I don't have that
great of a memory things from my
childhood it's very rare that I remember
them unless like I have a sip that helps
me run that helps remind me or it's like
a really huge memory some things I just
don't remember but the last dream I
remember that I cried and I mean bawled
my eyes out actually posted this on
Twitter but I had like this carry-on
suitcase full of my makeup because I
went to LA recently and I packed a huge
thing of makeup and I had a dream that I
put it all into a carry-on and I went
somewhere tropical I don't even know
where
and I left my carry-on on the sidewalk
open for some reason I don't know and I
was like hiking up the other way
well I went back down to get my carry-on
and some when I stole all of my makeup
and I was bawling my eyes out and I was
like ready to cut somebody I was so
upset in this dream I was bawling my
eyes up written a asked who was your
first kiss and I think I answered this
before
hi I don't know if I've answered who it
was but his name was Timmy slow awkward
amber cleverly asked if you can hang out
with any Kardashian for a day which one
would it be a why and what would you do
with them I would hang out with uh
kendall Jenner I just like Kendall a lot
I like Kylie - but Kendall's just always
been my favorite I think she's
absolutely stunning and I think she has
a great work ethic I guess like have her
show me behind like backstage of fashion
shows I think that's so interesting if
she's in a fashion show I'd be like her
buddy you know just like grab cider be
like oh yeah it's never gonna happen but
hey I would like to hang out with
Kendall one day
Ramar Edie said what can totally impress
you what can impress me I'm guessing
with other people is meeting somebody
who is genuinely nice you meet people a
lot of the times where they put on this
fake front and they're really nice to
you but it's just not the kind of nice
that they're gonna stick around and want
to be a friend or if they're they'll
help you out if God forbid you need it
like if something happens and you know
I'm the type of person where you could
just meet me and Ripley would exchange
phone numbers and if something were to
happen to you and I can come get you or
something I would and I feel like it's
hard to find people like that so when I
do I'm super impressed and I like to
keep those people around me those are
the kind of positive people I like to
have in my life I don't know if that's
really what you wanted the answer to be
but this vote came to mind
kayuu coups k UI p es ask at dmoz having
blond hair and would you ever go back to
blonde I I don't know y'all when I went
blonde couple months ago full-on
platinum if you guys missed out on it
just go check back a couple months ago
at some of my videos
hi when I went blonde
I literally felt like I was back in 2010
with my videos like it was so it was so
weird it was so cool though it's not
like I kind of backtracked I guess you
could say it was fun for the two weeks I
had it but I don't think I'll go back
blonde
I think brunettes my color and I like
being a brunette
I like the makeup styles that I do with
my brown hair I like clothes that I wear
my brown hair I noticed some people that
sounds really weird but that's just the
kind of person I am i coordinate makeup
and outfits with hair color that's just
what I did
I was just probably stay brunette for a
while if anything I'll probably go back
to that ombre color that I had last year
in the last year I'll probably go back
to something like that but I think it'll
be a while before I do anything and then
someone else asked if I've ever kissed a
girl and yes I have not intimately but I
have kissed a girl I feel like a lot of
girls have kiss girls I mean you know
when you're younger and like oh my god
it's my best friend ever and you do like
a peck and it weighs like woo that kind
of thing I'm trying to let go through
these and not answer the boyfriend ones
yet try to find the ones for me and I'm
having a very hard time I've been
strolling someone asked like what
motivates me I'm guessing like motivates
just in general like I guess Fitness and
life and things like that and what
motivates me is honestly like myself I
especially with Fitness I look at myself
and I'm like okay I'm seeing results and
seeing results this is what I want this
is my goal and if I keep reaching these
little goals and I notice differences
that's what motivates me I don't I mean
looking at other Fitness Instagram
accounts is very motivating but they're
not me I want to see it on my body you
know what I'm saying so I feel like I
motivate myself even with just work and
things like that if I see something I'm
doing doing very very well I keep
working hard at it I try my best and
it's just very motivating so I don't
know is that is that weird to say that I
feel like I motivate myself I just feel
like I do and I feel like that's not a
bad quality either a lot of you are
saying you want more of my burn book I'm
going to read you one more little
passage of it because you guys loved
that last time this is something I still
got to get back in to you guys because I
haven't even wrote in it since and I
they wanted to start a journal once I
met my new boyfriend but I've just
forgotten because I forget things really
easily so stuff like this is so crucial
I start next year and don't finish my s
boy series I will probably forget about
it tweet me and tell me to start writing
in my journal and I promise you I will
do it as it and you're gonna be like so
confused but this is just over start
from as he got in my car we talked about
everything how things were going things
we had in common
etc eventually we ended up listening to
music I had one song in particular that
I wanted him to hear it was thinking out
loud by Ed Sheeran have you ever heard
of Ed Sheeran I asked no I don't think
so
why we have a lot of music favorites in
common so I knew he was going to love it
as I was playing we ended up getting
very comfortable it's so cheesy but we
were looking at each other in a way that
googly eyes doesn't even begin to
describe it
I was falling for this guy I hated it
but it was happening and I couldn't help
my feelings I love that song he said
wait till you hear the rest
what about Sam hunt do you like his
music I loved the one called speakers
that's the one I'm going to play for you
next I just got in the car for about an
hour
one song came on that will now forever
be burned into my memory the song is
called try to face date I think that's
how you say the word dl no oh no that's
how you say it buzz by Ed Sheeran it's
one of the most beautiful songs I've
ever heard as a song played we were both
very quiet had our foreheads pressed
against each other and we just listened
and that that this is true all of this
stuff that I'm I put in here is is true
and things that I have done and that has
happened to me so when I read over this
up I like takes me back to that moment I
remember of course I'm in a better place
now but like I just think about stuff
that boys have done and I'm like God you
suck so that's another little passage
from the burn book I hope you enjoyed it
it's a little school different all right
we're gonna start asking or answering
questions about my boyfriend cuz it's
all I've been seeing so there's one
question right here by Aaron Harris oh
hey I know her don't I I feel like I
know this girl dude are maybe this isn't
the right Aaron I feel like I knew Aaron
Harrison high school bit my
be the right girl but she said do you
see yourself marrying Davis you don't
know Davis is my boyfriend at the moment
I know it's a little soon to ask but and
I I see Davis being around for a really
long time very long time I don't see
myself with anyone else right now it is
so really early and I don't want to jinx
it and I don't want to put that you know
thing up there but you know when you
just meet somebody and it just I've
never in my life felt this until I met
him but you just meet somebody and it's
like where have you been all my life you
know what I'm saying I mean we went to
the same high school for a couple years
and things like that and it's like how
did you not come into my life sooner
like I needed you so bad sometimes you
know I went through a horrible
relationship and a horrible breakup and
now I'm being showered with this person
who is just so good to me I don't know I
don't I can't answer that I I don't want
to jinx anything and I don't want to put
anything up too soon but I'm not seeing
him going anywhere to be quite honest
with you all right let's answer some
more questions about the relationship a
lot of you asked of where we met and
like how all that other stuff I'm gonna
keep that question for him if he ever
comes on camera which I think he will at
some point um just because he tells the
story so much better than I do I leave
out details just because I can't
remember sometimes cuz I really do have
a horrible memory he just tells the
story so much better than I do he has a
great memory he's super smart so he
always remembers stuff and I'm just like
sitting there listening and I'm like oh
yeah I forgot all about that
you know um somewhat Claudia asked how
did you make your relationship official
I love you I love you too and he
actually made it official he we were
laying down one night and we were just
talking and he had said well whether you
like it or not you're going to be my
girlfriend and he did in a really cute
way it wasn't like forceful and of
course it was something we both wanted
so much we wanted the title you know
we'd already you know made our
appearance and dated and stuff like that
we were just kind of like you know who's
gonna make it official and um he made it
official on his birthday so
yeah that's how that happened Bella asks
what's your favorite thing about him my
favorite thing about him is how smart he
is he's very intelligent and he doesn't
like it when I say that because he does
I don't know
that's smart I'm like yes you are he
goes to a very good school he's very
smart
it just really intrigues me I genuinely
love listening to him I could just I
could listen to him talk about science
stuff forever and I don't understand it
but I'm just so interested and it's so
cool to be around someone who is so
intelligent and that's like one of the
best qualities about him Cassandra
Garcia asked what did Joe initially like
love about one another that may Joe
attracted to each other well I met him
he thought I had a boyfriend oh well
here we go a 10-2 told story I'm not
going to tell you the whole story but he
thought I had a boyfriend in the
beginning of the night because I went
that I went to the bar seeing it with
one of my friends I was immediately
attracted to him when I saw him at this
bar when my friend introduced us the
moment he shook my hand I was like you I
need you in my life right now from that
moment that I shook his hand I was on a
mission that night to just be around him
and all the other stuff and it did not
go as planned at all like I said that's
the story he's gonna have to tell you
guys but didn't I display it at all but
it ended up working and it I don't it
just it all ended up falling into place
a lot of you asked about age too he
actually just turned 22 and in November
I'll be turning at 24 so we're almost
two years apart
beauty with SPS where did you go on your
first date so glad you found someone
Casey you deserve it girl thank you we
went to a place called fork in screen
and we would have went to get massages
we went go Swedish massages that was
really cool it was like a couples
massage or whatever cuz we already
talked in like hung out way before our
first official date so we were super
comfortable with each other it was kind
of like it was like second nature I
guess you could say but yeah that was
like our first official date dmt dennis
asked what is it that draws you to your
boyfriend and what are the things that
you don't like about him he knows I
adore him but the only thing that your
tastes me that I'm trying so hard to get
him to stop doing is fine
his nails he's doing better but biting
his nails is an issue that I am trying
to work on
we'll get there at some point but what
really draws me to him is how amazing he
makes me feel he makes me feel like I am
worth a million bajillion dollars and
every day I'm just so taken back at how
it's just weird like I am mother you
know I did not think I deserved someone
like that in my life I did not um well I
went say did not deserve I guess you can
say I didn't expect someone like that to
ever come into my life I've met a lot of
guys that have talked a lot of game call
well F boys I never ever thought that I
would meet someone who is so genuine and
really cares about me and lets me know
I'm beautiful when I have absolutely no
makeup on who tells me that they
absolutely love my personality and
there's just not a damn negative thing
with him that I can say other than
biting his nails I mean but that's like
that he stuff you know what I mean that
would never like make me cut someone off
but he makes me feel beautiful I was
single for a year and I was the happiest
single person ever because I got to be
myself and find myself and I think that
is so important when you come out of a
shitty relationship you need to find
yourself and you really need to focus on
making yourself happy and building
yourself and you know doing things that
are going to help you out in the future
and not even look for a boyfriend I did
not look for him we both didn't even
want a relationship it just happened you
know God really knew timing and he just
he knew like right now and I'm I peek
and I'm really happy and doing
everything I wanted to do he just likes
nut bags in there for me yeah this
question cracked me up because this is
very weird
Lilly McCurley asked how long were y'all
talking before that Q&amp;amp;A where you
mentioned you're not looking for a guy
that is faked I don't know if you guys
remember but I haven't
I had like a mental breakdown one week
and it was on a Monday I like lost it
I'd you know when things just build up
like it was just work and my dogs and my
dogs were fighting and I was just
couldn't get it together and I just
broke down that's what happened and um I
was kind of feeling self-conscious too
you know it was just a bunch of
different things that at that point in
time I was feeling kind of rough for a
few weeks and I just like lost it I did
that on Monday I posted that video I
think it was like on a Wednesday I think
I'm not sure I'm not sure the order of
everything I could have broken down like
on a weekend but that Thursday did like
the day or two after I posted that video
I had went out and I had met him like
how weird is that I was just saying I
didn't want a boyfriend and I didn't see
myself finding anybody and then
literally a day or two later we met and
it's been it's it's been us ever since
how weird is that
and Amanda ponts asked you said he was
going back to school so how do you guys
get through the long-distance part I
never used FaceTime before Davis I never
used it ever in my life I use FaceTime
more than anything and now we FaceTime
all the time it's very rare that we just
stay here and talk on the phone we
FaceTime all the time and I actually
really enjoy it it's like he's sitting
there with me sometimes we'll be on
FaceTime and not even talk we'll be
working or something and it's just
knowing up our presence is there you
know what I mean it's not like we have
to talk it's just so comfortable you
know
so lots and lots of FaceTime and just
planning things we've planned a lot over
the past few months for us to do and
places to go so um lots of that but even
dude just like have a cute countdown or
something in your head or on your phone
and just kind of keep the spark alive I
compliment him all the time I just I
can't help myself because I'm just so
into him I just I think I compliment him
every day and I'm pretty sure it's every
single time we talk I'm just like you're
so handsome you're so great and even
through text messages and he always
texts me everything
morning and every single night that's
just the kind of person he is
so I really appreciate the little things
you know so I think face time really
wants a lot though
so those are all the questions I'm
answering it today I hope you guys
