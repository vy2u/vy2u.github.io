routine for you guys and it's on a
foundation that I absolutely love you'll
see me do my blush and like my powder
concealer stuff like that we focused on
this foundation because I'm seriously in
love with it and it's the number seven
stay perfect perfection continued
foundation I'm in 30 almond and if you
go into target it's like in the boots
aisle or number seven I can't remember
what they call themselves but one of
those and I'm seriously in love with
that it's SPF 15 and it says for a
long-lasting flawless finish
I do like completely agree with that
when I read the back of this I was kind
of nervous because it says it's a
moisturizing foundation and I've barely
very oily skin but I do love this and it
doesn't like make it even oily or you
know like greasy and nasty or anything
like that you just really complements my
skin so well this is the bottle it comes
in I really love it I think it's super
like chic and pretty and just gorgeous
the best thing about this foundation is
it comes with a pump so I really really
truly love that it's easy for me to like
save on the product and like you know I
know how much I need to use now after
experimenting with it for a while I love
this stuff I can't wait for you guys to
see it and I'm so happy I finally did
the video I've been meaning to do it for
a while now I just haven't had the time
so yeah this is basically my flawless
foundation I just go ahead let you see
it close-up I really really love this
foundation go try it out if you do let
me know it's 13 and 99 at Target and
yeah and by the way I mentioned this on
Twitter I will be doing a little video
probably here this weekend I have to
film it and then out of that so who
knows but it'll be up sometime soon but
I am getting rid of some clothes if
you're interested I'll have a video on
it and we'll do everything PayPal and
business and we'll just you know it'll
be more in the video but I'm gonna do is
kind of like modeling I guess just show
you it looks like on the body because I
think taking pictures you don't really
get to see what it really looks like on
so I'm going to be doing that and you
know they'll be more information on that
you but just keep your eyes on if you're
interested a lot of questions ever I
don't have my engagement ring on I am
still engaged engaged you're bringing it
right now is actually in the bathroom
which is where it usually is and like I
don't want to get product and stuff on
it so and I forget to put it on so I
forgot but I hope you guys enjoy this
video like it if you are wanting to see
a skincare video so like this video if
you want to see the skincare and yeah I
also do my new before I apply foundation
or anything is apply a primer and the
one I use and been using for a while is
this essence of beauty airbrush primer I
really like it cuz it's a gel a primer
so it's really great for oily skin and
stuff and it really keeps my foundation
on for a while so I've been loving this
and I get for $5 CVS not sure if they
still had it I got in a while back and I
really haven't seen it since so I don't
know where the heck it went but that's
why I got it and I'm gonna go ahead and
shake up the foundation
and then I'm just gonna do one full pump
on the back of my hand like that and
take my brush and just dab it in there
and then I'm gonna apply this all over
the bottom half of my face and you can
see I have redness and stuff I don't
think I have rosacea I just have Reds
redness on my skin especially when after
I apply a primer I get really wet skin
so I don't know why but I do use this
thing so I should focus on working that
in all over my skin sorry about the
light holy cow what's going on take it
down my neck a little bit still get on
my earlobes and then I'm gonna take like
basically a half a pump so I just need
about that much I don't like a lot and I
ping this on my forehead uh-oh
I need to get me one of those like
stand-up mirrors like from Conair or
whatever that would be really nice I
wish I had like an Australian accent I
love those accents they're so cute
okay so this foundation does drive
pretty quickly which I do like umm
because then we don't sit around and
wait for forever to like put on my
pattern stuff like normally I would let
this sit for a minute but I don't really
have to this foundation and you could
kind of see like I wish the camera
really just showed you guys how great
this foundation is but it's like such a
flawless finished and I mean this camera
I doesn't like just show you how
flawless it is but it really is and I
really really love it especially having
oily skin she's been my favorite so far
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take
a concealer do know which one I'm gonna
use I kind of don't like have a set
concealer or set blush that I use every
single day that was just kind of you
pointless because I keep buying stuff
I'm gonna use my iMac one my Mac select
cover up in NW 30 I'm going to take my
little concealer brush like this from
Sonia Kashuk and a little bit goes along
away with this stuff so just I do about
that much like a little bitty dots like
that right well that's gonna be way too
much you see that and it's way too much
take some of that off
okay so now I'm just going to work that
into my bottom run to under my eyes on
her am I going on whatever um in my
inner corner cuz I do get a little bit
darker right there so I'm just kind of
patting and rubbing it in especially
when I get to where my makeups done I
kind of stay I'm a little careful cuz I
don't want to smudge you know my makeup
all around that stuff my dogs are
working for when the big dog barks the
puppy thinks she can bark too so she's
trying to like could be just like them
then I take a little bit over my redness
and I just do the same on this side
don't read this I feel like this has a
full-coverage finish for me it probably
won't be enough for some people but I
really like it it works for me because I
don't have like acne really bad or
anything like that I just have like a
few acne scars but that's about it just
gonna rub out the edges of my finger
especially in the inner corner just kind
of Pat that back in and rub that part
out okay so the next thing I like to do
is set my concealer which is a very
important part you know when you're
applying concealer and stuff so the one
I've been using a lot lately is this elf
High Definition powder and this is like
three dollars and it's really nice I did
only pull the little flat bag not even
halfway because it's a very messy
product I did keep the puff and what I
do is I take this elf blush brush and
this is what I use for I use for blush I
tap some of this transparent powder on
it then I tap it on the sponge and so I
give up this much and I just pack that
in my concealer wherever I put it I just
kind of put that back on like so and
then what I do since I've Pat it on the
puff I don't have to go back into the
big jar I just Pat this puff and get
more product out so I really like this
stuff works for me just kind of got my
t-zone real quickly but just Pat that
concealer just like the most important
part of like your concealer you need to
set it so put this bad boy back up okay
okay so the next thing is I'm gonna put
powder all over my face oh I take my
kabuki this is again from ELF and I take
this powder it's the cover talk to Tim
power from Physicians Formula seriously
I've been loving this stuff it is
amazing it's supposed to like minimize
wrinkles and stuff I don't really notice
that I really don't care about it but
this has such an amazing
finish for my skin and I just love it
and I love transparent powders for
whenever I use foundation because I
don't want to put like even more color
on top and then it looks cakey so I just
take this powder with my kabuki brush
and this is in transparent medium tap
off and just quickly buff into my skin
down my neck forehead okay so the next
thing is blush like I said I don't have
like a set blush I used but today I will
be using Mac's dolly mix mmm just gonna
take that on my brush and apply it to my
cheeks this is gotta be one of my
favorite blushes love rush - I just am
in love with them so okay and that's
pretty much it I do add some bronzer
which if I do use bronzer its NARS
casino and it looks like this
I don't contour every day but I will
take that same kabuki brush and I'll
just like hit my chest really quickly my
neck and I like tap off a little bit and
then just graze my face just really
quickly like that so there you have so I
hope you all enjoyed this video it's
been requested a lot and I was excited
to do it especially with this foundation
I've been loving from the drugstore or
whatever so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
and I will see you on the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
