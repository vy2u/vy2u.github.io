updated foundation routine I haven't
done one since I did it with the Revlon
Colorstay foundation and that was I
think about last last summer I do
believe I can't remember but that was
the last one I think was that last one I
don't know I can't remember when I did
my last foundation routine so I figured
I'd do an updated one because I've been
using these products for a while now and
I've really been loving them and I've
had a ton of questions from you guys and
when I was going to do one so I decided
to do it today I hope you guys enjoyed
this video it's pretty simple nothing
too crazy it's just basic foundation
routine and this is just how I get a
flawless finish to my face I really love
it and I hope you guys enjoy it as well
so if you're interested in seeing how I
get my flawless face then just keep
watching okay so today I'm going to be
using the Beauty Blender and my makeup
forever matte velvet plus and color I'm
using today is number 40 I'm not super
self tanned but I'm not like pale at all
either so all I do is I just squirt some
on the back of the Beauty Blender the
reason why mine so dirty is because
making sure is dirty enough for the
makeup brush video that I'm doing this
will be included in it on how I wash my
Beauty Blender but so I put on the back
so basically what I'm going to do is
apply this in a tea on my face so I
always go my cheeks forehead and I do my
chin then I go on my nose and then I
start blending it out
on my face and I'm just patting this in
you don't have to be super hard with
this because the Beauty Blender is so
soft it kind of just blends it by itself
I have a couple videos raving about this
one of them was a first impression and
then it was a first impression update
and I really truly do love this and it
feels so good on the skin because you'd
have to damp it underneath water for it
to work really well and it just feels so
good on the skin and ever since I got
this beauty blender I don't have to wear
a face concealer I can just use the
Beauty Blender and it covers up what I
need and it just makes the foundation
really do its job so I love that
next I'm going in with my covergirl
simply ageless corrector I've talked
about this a lot it's one of my new
favorite products so it just has this
worldly corrector in the Olay um little
moisturizer thing I just swore my finger
in there like that and all I do is take
it underneath my eyes and then put it in
the Triangle motion as well and this is
going to help correct underneath the
eyes and really brighten up my under eye
area and it makes me look a lot more
awake I always like to drag some on my
lid too because I usually have a little
bit left over so I like to use my finger
when doing this because it just blends
it so easily and quick and the warmth of
your finger really helps the product
melt into your skin now I do have
another drugstore foundation that I
really love it's the covergirl clean
foundation I showed it in my Valentine's
Day makeup tutorial and I really loved
that foundation as well but I have four
tubes of this eye this is like my Holy
Grail foundation I absolutely love it so
as you can see this eye is a lot
brighter more awake looking and it just
looks a lot better it looks a little
crazy because my other eye is not done
but we're doing it now
I really love the cover or corrector
it's one of those products that I just
highly recommend from the drugstore and
this come in from a drugstore is insane
I would expect this to be like a
high-end product it's that good
taking the maybelline mineral power
concealer I love this one as well I just
like the top off the corrector with a
skintone color concealer because it just
looks more natural to me so this is in
light for five I'm just going to do a
couple dots no big deal and I'm just
going to quickly blend it out with my
fingers then I'm going to go on my
favorite brush for underneath my eyes I
don't use this with a corrector because
I might rather use my fingers with it
but just for the concealer part this is
a sigma tapered kabuki f-86 I've used
this for my under eyes ever since I saw
Tiffany D use in one of her videos it
blends it so evenly so quick it just
looks flawless so all I do is just Pat
and go back and forth with this and
it'll be blended in like like that it's
amazing Fator I come in one brush for
underneath the eyes would be this one
because it's so soft too it's just
amazing okay now I'm going to do is take
the ever so amazing mega forever
transparent powder I absolutely love
this I have already went through one of
these and this is my second one and I'm
quickly going through this one as well
the best transparent powder I've ever
tried in my life you guys I'm not even
kidding I've tried the elf one I've
tried the Make Up For Ever HD powder I'm
not a huge fan of that one anymore I
used to really like it but when I went
something like this you could just tell
the difference in the way it looks this
one looks a lot more natural and it also
doesn't have a white cast in pictures
the HD one does really bad
it will white cast like crazy but this
one's in transparent natural and I'm
just going to set my under eyes with
this sometimes I will also set all of my
face makeup with this that's usually
what I do but I'm going to use a colored
powder today because I've been really
liking this powder that I picked up and
I wanted to use it today but so that's
why I'm using this one underneath my
eyes this one's also great at keeping me
matte it's called the super matte loose
powder and it seriously keeps matte all
day long I really love this product and
I totally recommend it I'm a huge fan of
Make Up For Ever for the face that brain
is just awesome to me and after my face
makeup I'm taking the Revlon nearly
naked powder this is actually a really
nice powder it's really fine and it
doesn't look cakey on the face at all
and this is in medium so I'm just going
to take this with a powder brush and I'm
just going to set the rest of my face
makeup it's just a really nice finish to
the face I like this powder a lot now
for bronzer I love the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer this is just
the original chocolate I talked about
this a lot in my videos I really love it
another favorite bronzer I love is the
hoola benefit bronzer this one's really
great as well these are my top two high
end bronzers I mean I absolutely love
them I'm going to be using the Too Faced
one today another great one is NYC sunny
bronzer that's actually in my purse so
awesome I keep it with me in my purse at
all times because if I ever need a touch
of bronzer that's the one that I like to
go to so I'm going to take this little
contour brush from Sephora and I'm going
to do more of a kind of stronger contour
so basically if you roll your brush you
can feel your cheekbone you roll down
and you can feel the hollows of your
cheeks now normally when you start
rolling down your brush we'll get right
here the tip of your ear this is where I
start so I have it starts at the tip of
my ear and I go down I never ever ever
go any further in I always stop at the
end of where my eye is so my contour
will always start here I never bring it
in towards my mouth because it doesn't
look natural so I always stop right here
at the end of my eye which that will
give you a really nice contour and once
you start doing this a couple times
you'll really get used to it and know
where your contour is I don't have to
measure it out anymore I just kind of
buff it in and go because I know where
it is but if you're new to it
and just start practicing do the little
rolling trick find your hollows and just
kind of feel for it and you place the
contour there and you'll be fine and
you'll get used to it and then you'll
know where to put it in no time
so go and take this and just buff it I
start from the back and work my way
forward now sometimes I do crazy faces
well not crazy but little fishy faces on
my face just because I don't know I
wouldn't be doing my contour right
without them so I'm just blending this
out and like I said I stopped right here
where the end of my eye is and I just
blend it
then I'm going to take it on the tops of
my forehead just around right here so
kind of bronzed up and shape my face as
well because I do have a bigger forehead
so I just like to place the contour
right there to have some shadow I'll
even put some a little bit in the middle
as well another place I like to put my
contour is right below my bottom lip
because it just makes it a little bit
more powder so I just dust some like
this just makes a little bit more pouty
take that same color going underneath my
jaw just like this
and sometimes I'll contour my nose I'm
still working on that so whenever I
perfect the contouring of the nose I
will show you guys but I'm still working
on it I have some practice still but
I've been really loving contouring my
nose so maybe I'll show you guys that
very soon but then I'm just going to
take this brush and just blend my
contour I don't want to blend it all the
way because we put contour there for a
reason
I just want to blend it out so it's not
super harsh and I'm also going to take
that same bronzer and take it down my
neck and I love it on my chest whatever
was left over I'll take it on my chest
because I want to make sure everything's
nice and even all nice for my skin now
I'm taking my favorite favorite blush
and this is the Mac mineralize
skinfinish in stereo rose I do apologize
this was limited edition it's freaking
amazing I was able to pick it up and I I
love this color so much it's just
beautiful I cannot get enough of this
color so this is what we using for my
blush today another blush that I really
love to go to for day-to-day use is this
NARS blush um everybody says I say it
wrong so I say it as dowser I like that
name better because people are telling
me is called deucer
I don't even know what it's called do
you see e you are and this is a great
everyday color as well and then of
course any drugstore one is great as
well
anything from Wet n Wild is just amazing
pearlescent pink is one of my favorites
so I'm just going to take my little
blush brush with my stereo rose skin
finish I start my blush from the back
and work my way forward as well because
I don't want to apply too much product
on the front my face every time I'm
working with like contouring shades or
blush I always work from the back and go
forward so I'll just start here and
follow my cheekbone gives just a nice
little glow let me tell you this is
gonna be my go-to for summer it's gonna
look so pretty with a tan
taking a little bit extra and I just
like to place it right above my brows
there's really no reason for it you
don't have to do it that's just what I
like to do taking that brush again this
is an elf kabuki brush also I don't
think I ever said that but I like to
just blend those together I'm gonna take
this mary lou manizer this is just a
highlight you could use a light
eyeshadow that has shimmer if you wanted
to for a highlight it has to have really
fine shimmer in it though soft and
gentle I've got to pick that up because
I've been craving it this is really
great you could find it on HauteLook
they were actually just on the other day
I think this was like eight dollars or
something on there so always keeping an
eye out for a whole look I will put the
link down below hard candy also has an
amazing highlighter it's in tiki it's
called a baked bronzer but there is no
way that would be a bronzer so I'm just
taking this it on the lace fan brush I'm
just going to swipe this right above
where I put my blush and I also put it
up on my brow as well so I like that
it's kind of shaped this way because it
just makes it fun to kind of twirl it up
and yeah that's pretty much it guys but
the other drugstore foundation that I
absolutely love that I used in my other
video is this covergirl clean foundation
highly recommend if you have oily skin
the very nice light foundation but using
it with my Beauty Blender it applies a
medium to full coverage and it's just
amazing so I highly recommend this as
well it's such a beautiful beautiful
foundation if you would also like me to
do a demo and a review on this cover or
outlast stay fabulous foundation and
just like this video I have already used
it and I know what I think of it and if
you guys would like to see a review and
demo just like this and I will be happy
to do that for you and thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this video and I will see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
