my updated foundation routine these are
just products I've been really loving
lately and I've just been doing this a
lot so I thought I would show you guys
I've had a few questions and I figured I
would just show you it is kind of a
mixture of just store and high-end but
of course you can switch out whatever
products you want to use also if you've
emailed me or tweeted me whatever it's
about the bombshell code for new me
which is the one where you can get two
of these wands for $100 the code did
expire so do apologize but they did give
me another one that is active till
October 1st so I'll put that down below
you can check it out and you can get two
wands for $100
you
so if you want to see my current
foundation routine then just keep
watching for the first step in my
foundation routine is primers and I've
already done this because I like my
primers to kind of just sink into my
skin so I let them sit for a little bit
after I applied them like I'll do my
hair or something but the primers I like
to use are these two I've talked about
them before it's the benefit
Porefessional which is a great pore
minimizing primer all I do just twist it
up squeeze them out take them on my
finger and press this into these larger
pores that I have and it helps really
fill them in and make them look a lot
smaller this doesn't keep me as matte as
I wish it would so I do go in with this
one this is a Mac prep and prime skin
refines own treatment and this is also
great at pore minimizing and keeping
your skin really matte I love this
product I think it's amazing it hasn't
broken me out nothing like that so I
really do enjoy it now as you can see my
face is a lot lighter than my body and
that's because I don't self tell my self
tan to my face I just don't like to do
it I'm afraid I'll break out I have
super sensitive skin and I'm just not
putting any self-tanner on my face
that's what foundations for right so the
foundation I will be using today is the
covergirl three-in-one foundations I
have the colors 8:55 soft honey and
golden tan now I just did self tan so
I'll be mixing these two together and
then for today I'm going to use my
Beauty Blender when Beauty Blender is by
far my favorite product to use for
foundation just because it really makes
your skin look flawless it puts the
foundation on amazingly and it adds like
a thin layer but it covers everything so
that's what I like I like a thin layer
of foundation but I still want that you
know full coverage finish and I find
that this product does that for me so
I'm just going to start with the bottom
half of my face and put this all over
now sometimes when you're self-tanning
it is hard to get your face to match
your body
that's what bronzers for sometimes you
can't get it exactly right but you know
you can always brought up your skin and
make it look you know like it matches a
little bit more so I'm just pouncing
this on my skin
and I love this foundation because it's
really lightweight but it still gives
you great coverage it's by far my
favorite foundation in the drugstore
it's so good
and then using it with the beauty
blender it's like even better I love it
so that is it for the foundation now
we're going to move on to concealers and
I have two favorites one from the
drugstore and one that is high-end my
favorite from the drugstore is this Jane
Cosmetics concealer I'm using it so much
this month it is so good the color I
have is in light and I like this this is
also a great everyday concealer because
I find that this light shade isn't super
light underneath my eyes so it doesn't
give like a really dramatic highlight by
far my favorite favorite favorite
concealers is the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer I have NC 20 and NC 30 I adore
these they will last you so long if
you're going out and you want a
long-lasting concealer or if you're
working a really long work day I think
this is what you should try because they
really do last forever they don't sink
into your fine lines and it just gives a
nice flawless look underneath your eyes
I just it's really really good so I'm
actually going to use the Jain one today
from Jane Cosmetics now the amount of
concealer you want to do is completely
up to you but I like my concealer so I
am going to put it in like a triangle
motion underneath my eyes I find that
this gives I don't know it gives better
coverage like if I have some more
redness peeking through this will help
cover it even more and I think it looks
a lot better doing it in the upside down
triangle because if you just do like a
little bit underneath here sometimes
you'll get that oval shading underneath
your eyes I like to just apply in an
upside down triangle motion take it in
here into the inner corner up a little
bit on the lid because I get really
really dark in the inner part of my eye
and I take a little bit down the sides
of my nose and again I am going to take
my Beauty Blender and I'm just going to
cut this into my skin and you can just
see that that concealer really sets in
nicely and it just looks so flawless I
love it
I also dragged it kind of over my lids
to just to help conceal any veins or
discoloration as I got older I've
noticed more veins kind of showing up on
my lids but my primer that I use for my
eyelids which is Mac Paint Pot
soft ocher that really helps camouflage
them as well but I just like a little
bit to go on the list not a lot because
sometimes with my oily eyelids they'll
get a little bit more greasy throughout
the day if I put too much concealer on
them and that is concealer done so now
we're moving on to powder now the powder
I love to use to set my under eye area
is this makeup Forever's super matte
loose powder and they're actually
discontinuing it which completely sucks
but this is a great powder I recommend a
nice finely milled powder for your under
eye area I'm on the hunt for another
great powder that I just am obsessed
with like the makeup for everyone so let
me know if you have any recommendations
because I'm like completely out of this
as you can see I'm like scraping the
bottle or scraping the jar to get the
extra stuff out now the one I usually
use to set my under eye area is this
Sigma tapered kabuki f-86 but I actually
washed all my brushes and my beauty
blenders last night so this one is still
wet so I'm not going to use that today
just gonna use this Real Techniques
contour brush just because it's kind of
tapered and it's dry and I'm just gonna
set my under eye with this
so just tap off any excess and then
apply I can't believe I'm out of it this
is a translucent powder so it's not
going to add any extra coverage it's
just gonna set that makeup that we put
on now to set the rest of my face makeup
I am gonna use this one this is the Dior
air flash matte touch if you have very
oily skin you should try this if you
have combo skin with dry patches don't
try this if you have dry skin don't try
this because it is a mattifying powder
and it will cling to your dry patches
I had a dry patch on my skin not too
long ago and I use this and it cling to
it and I was like oh no so if you have
trying to skin stay away from this but
if you're very oily like myself you need
to try it I do believe they only have
one shade of this but it does have like
a beige color to it and what I like to
do is I like to spray my brush with it
tap off any excess and then I just Pat
it into my skin and this powder will
make you look seriously
Wallace keeping that for the longest
time now it does have a scent to it I
like it it's kind of like a nice fresh
scent but if you're very sensitive with
scented products I don't think I
recommend this for you and I find that
this powder does add a little bit of
extra coverage but not much now you
can't spray it directly on your face if
you want to but I find that it looks a
little too powdery when I do that so
that's why I spray on the brush and then
apply it and it just gives a nice kind
of flawless finish to the skin now for
bronzer I'm going to be using my current
favorite bronzer this is the NYC Sun and
bronze bronzing powder so what it looks
like and this is in and montauk bronze
and I want you to be using an iMac brush
with this it is the Mac 134 or 134 just
gonna put some on my brush and just
bronze my skin
I like this bronzer because it's a
really pretty shade and it doesn't look
like orange or anything I really do like
it and it's like what four bucks so
affordable take a little bit down my
neck when I'm bronzing go to the tops of
my forehead do it a little bit on my
chin too because I find when I bronze my
skin and I don't hit my chin it looks a
little odd it's a really good bronzer
I've been using it so much another one
of my favorite bronzers is this Jane
Cosmetics bronzer this isn't in power
and I like this to contour so I'm going
to take that brush we used before
they're from Real Techniques this is the
contour brush and I'm just going to do a
tap off any excess and contour a little
bit more with this just to give me a
more defined look
at forehead because I got a big forehead
so got a contour that guy and then I
take a little bit sometimes I'll contour
my nose I haven't mastered it yet so I'm
not going to show you guys how I do it
but I am going to show you my lip I put
a little bit underneath my lip just to
make it look a little bit more pouty
just like that contouring does great
things you guys great things I'm going
to wipe the excess on the back of my
hand and then I'm going to blend out
that contour that we just did
just like that and now it's time for
blush I don't have really a blush that I
go to every single time because I have
so many in my drawer that I just kind of
switch them out so the blush I'll be
using today is from NARS this is
actually the foreplay palette it got it
a while back and I just haven't shown it
enough love so I'm going to use orgasm
from this blush palette and it does have
two other shades that you can mix in
like a golden highlight but I usually
just go for the orgasm of color because
it's really pretty and goes with a lot
of different looks just put this on my
cheeks I do like to kind of press the
blush into my skin and I don't bring it
onto my apples just cuz I don't like the
way that looks so I just kind of press
it here along my cheeks and then I take
my Real Techniques brush and blend out
the blush and contour
and then that's pretty much it so that
is it I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching don't
forget to like it and subscribe and I
hope you guys have a great day I'll see
you in my next video bye
they actually like this color on its own
but since this look was so dark with the
eyes I kind of wanted to lighten it up
so I just used Mac's cream the nude over
top which I love and then my NYX butter
gloss in and creme Brule just to make my
lips look nice and shiny and plump so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
