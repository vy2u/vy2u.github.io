requests for like a vanity tour and like
a makeup collection tour thing
I'm just really quickly going to show
you what I have how I you know store it
all and just little stuff like that this
is my temporary setup I will be getting
a new one but for now this is what I'm
working with so I figured I'd show you
guys the storage and stuff you can go
ahead and tell you all where this is
from this is a very affordable setup
this um vanity is that been back to me
on you can get in in black or wat and um
it's like $150 a day believe and it does
come with the zebra chair zebra lion
from Dollar General I believe it was
like maybe twelve bucks
those two pink storage containers I got
those at Walmart probably last summer
not sure if they really have it but
that's where I got those but then these
two down here this is two separate ones
that I stacked on top of each other that
fit perfectly underneath those were
$6.00 they're really five dollars and
some change but I'm just gonna round it
up for you guys and I got those from
Walmart these are just products I got
today so ignore them I'm trying to let
you experiment with them and stuff so I
just got them this is my eye storage and
that is my face but we'll go ahead and
go right here I have my little mess that
I got my glam bag right there
these are my face brushes I got these
from Dollar General as well for a dollar
and then the beads in here are from
Michaels
they come in a little bag like this and
I do believe they're like seven dollars
so of course they come more so that than
just you know that but they come in
little bags like that believe you can
find them in like the vase section or
near there um just ask for kind of vase
fillers that's what I asked for once you
leave me to this I have little coupons
back there my moisturizer which is my
Estee Lauder time zone one a kabuki my
shine control I got my glam bag and then
I just have my eye brushes right here in
the same little jar with the same beads
and then I do keep a cloth right here
because
this being a black table you can kinda
see where the makeup just kind of sits
on it which really bugs the crap out of
me but right here I put a towel down
because that's where the most like color
comes off and gets on the table and all
that stuff so that's why that's there so
we're gonna go ahead and go to the I bin
I have my Naked palette right here and
then these are the most used mascaras
and eyeliners I use so I have like
smolder and stuff up here so these are
my everyday use things right there and
of course the eyelash curlers I don't
keep anything up here because I always
forget about them in this top drawer
these are my most used shadows that I
reach for like in an instant I do have
my Paint Pot all of these since they're
my most used I like them to be flipped
up for the name is facing towards me
because I know what the color looks like
I just want to know you know the name
because I find that to be the easiest
for me to find like whenever I'm
reaching in here I don't want to look
for the color I want the name so I have
a few quads back here like Rand Coleman
Estee Lauder my two favorite Oriole and
fallible shadows and you have another
one back there yeah I do and then some
tattoo ones that I like to use as well
here I have more tattoos just like NYX
stuff I have some drugstore stuff
underneath here and some quads back
there as well this is my lip drawer now
I'm not a big fan of lips right now
these are the only lipsticks I pretty
much wear and are the Mac ones that I
have and I use the Revlon a lot as well
but I haven't really been too big on
lips but I'm trying to get more into it
I'm not really into glosses but on the
lipsticks I do like as long as they're
new so we're going to go onto face and
this is just the setup I have this NARS
Dan Morey palette right here it's just
the easiest thing to reach for if I need
a fast look I reach for the Naked
palette in the NARS my face palette and
I'm done I also have my NARS foundation
up here again I have nothing in this
store just have some powders
concealers I use more often blushes that
I'd like to use a lot just stuff like
that more powders back there so that's
in the store this one I have more
powders blushes bronzers you know just
lower that back there down here I have
more blushes I don't know what's going
on me and blushes lately but I keep
buying them highlight more powders
bronzers bronzer blush palette and a lip
product way back there now in these
little drawers right here that come out
I do have in this one just q-tip sponges
and tape and then in this one it's kind
of messy excuse it I have some lashes
these B's I have paper like videos I
want to do my makeup like this mirror
some hair ties just stuff like that
receipts for future videos so we're
gonna go over down here to this little
one right here that fell and the first
chore is just eye mascaras and eyeliners
and lash glue that's all that's in this
one just ones I don't really use every
single day but I do turn to every now
and then so that's just those and here's
more face products I do use a lot of
this stuff that's in this drawer I just
don't feel like keeping it all out in
the open so I have just some Mac ones I
have the Estee Lauder Michael Kors NARS
elf more stuff back there so that's
what's in this one and here I just have
more like drugstore shadows like Sonia
Kashuk wet and wild NYC I have a lot of
Maybelline quads like these little four
ones to have a lot of these they're in
there in here I have more blushes
another little bronzer thing I have a
what is this
bronzer did I say bronzer I can't
remember and these are the only loose
eyeshadows that I have I'm not a huge
fan of them I have to pan these because
I really cannot stand loose eyeshadows
but when I pan these these will
definitely be in like a little palette
or something but have those down here is
just more eyeshadow quads I have like
the greed and vanity palette
Wendy the catwalk Ike it went wild and
Mycenae just stuff like that in here I
have more face products that have this
elf High Definition powder because I
absolutely hate it being on my vanity
it's way too chunky i mineralized
skinfinish a foundation that's still in
the box because I have to do a review
and stuff on it in a tutorial then they
have another foundation a concealer and
then there's like a little product back
there just chilling this is basically
body stuff while I will strictly use for
body and not like on my face or anything
and this is the hard candy glow and the
tantastic from Milani these two drawers
have absolutely nothing and them and
then in the bottom I just have samples
and things that are gonna go back to Mac
I'm just like I peek the little
containers in there so whenever I have
what is it like six I'm gonna return
them all back so yeah that's pretty much
it and then like right there I have
extra makeup bags and that's my nail bag
right there but that's pretty much my
vanity it's nothing too extravagant but
it's definitely you know something that
I've basically like all this makeup I
pretty much accumulated and you know a
few months and I'm really pleased with
how I store it because I'm not a big fan
of like this that's bothering me I'm not
a huge fan of everything just sitting
out in the open unless I'm really really
using it so I like to just store
everything and make sure it's put away
and stuff like that so I hope you guys
enjoy this I figured I'd do it since I
was um I'm like less than ten people
away from 4,000 last time I checked so I
want to thank you all so so so much for
being very supportive and I hope you all
enjoyed this video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
