an everyday face routine
I don't want foundation everyday I just
like to let my skin breathe I'll
probably wear foundation like once
during the week and like once on the
weekend so probably like twice a week if
that it just highly depends on when I'm
off and stuff like that if you want to
see basically what I do during the week
when I don't wear foundation I'm gonna
go ahead and show you guys and also um I
don't know if in the video I haven't
watched it yet I've been trying to get
it off my camera but I don't know if
they'll show you how my skin matches but
I don't know if you can tell that my
face does match my neck it's maybe like
I don't know it's like a highlight
around here because the concealer stuff
like that by promise it matches so yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I loved seeing kind of what everybody
does you know for day-to-day basis kind
of makeup I didn't include my eye makeup
maybe I'll do that another day so let's
go ahead and get onto the tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
