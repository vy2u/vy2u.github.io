on how I get a flawless face without
foundation I do have problems skin and
you're gonna go ahead and see that in
the beginning of the tutorial when I
show you guys but I'm just gonna show
you what I use to really help even out
my skin tone and just make my face look
a little bit more presentable for pretty
much everyday use because I don't like
to use a foundation every day but if you
are interested in seeing how I get a
full coverage face with foundation I'll
put that video in the downbar but for
now I'm going to show you how I get this
full coverage face without foundation so
if you're interested in seeing how I do
this then just keep watching okay so as
you can see my skin is just not perfect
I'm breaking out this one right here I
don't know what made me react but kind
of raking out a lot on my forehead and
of course I always have my redness right
here so that's what it looks like okay
so I'm gonna start off with concealer
I'm taking this dermablend concealer
shown this a few times in my videos I
really love it and I want to apply this
on the back of my hand and I have really
been interesting my brushes lately I
love them if you're interested in
purchasing some I'll put the link down
below if you watched my makeup
collection video you saw have the mister
bunny collection and then I also had the
Kabuki so those are the brushes I'll be
using today so I'm taking this signal
around kabuki this is the f8f 82 sorry
I'm just gonna take some concealer on it
I'm just gonna go like over my redness
and like conceal any blemishes that I
might have and sort of even out my skin
tone a little bit this is a great
concealer for that
and I don't know again I know I said in
my last like my um foundation routine I
didn't know if you guys could tell but
like you probably can't tell now cuz the
lighting but my face doesn't match my
neck so I kind of used some darker
products to help with that so I'm just
applying this all over my redness my
face kind of blending it in this brush
is really great I just applying some
concealer you apply a little bit more of
the dermablend on the back of my hand
just like a tiny bit like smaller than a
piece on and I'm going to put this on my
forehead which is where everyone like
the most problems I don't know what is
going on but having some problems up
there I'm should I go over a redness
kind of right here also this dermablend
concealer is great if you have redness
or anything like that I think that's
what it's um like purpose was cuz when I
went to Ulta is said something about
covering redness and I was like I gotta
have it but it's really awesome I love
it and as you can see it just really
like makes everything look so even again
and like there's where what redness like
I don't see it so I really really love
this for everyday that is the dermablend
concealer I just put it where I need it
and then I'm gonna take this Rimmel
match perfection concealer and like I've
used quite a bit of it but that's what
it looks like I love this stuff to use
everyday under my eyes and the amazing
cosmetics concealer is amazing as well
but um that's a really expensive
concealer so I only used it like on days
off or if I'm getting really dressed up
or something but for like work and
everyday I'll just use this because it's
a really nice concealer also so I'm
gonna push up some of the product and
I'm going to apply this in like a
triangle motion and fill it in under my
eyes so just like that
okay a little bit on the tip of my nose
I don't know why I do that I just really
like it so I'm gonna take my finger as
always and blend it this concealer is
awesome at covering and brightening and
like highlighting the under eye area so
if you don't want to go spend the money
on the amazing cosmetics concealer this
is also a really great one just for
everyday use because it really does
brighten up and are there a drag it
sorta up here also it just like melts
into the skin it's awesome it doesn't
take long to blend this out either so
I'm gonna take the sigma precision flat
angled brush it just looks like this
it's one of the newer ones that has the
really nice cut edge so it's like a
really nice slant and I'm just gonna
sort of blend out any lines and go
around my nose a little bit and just
make sure everything is blended Pat over
my concealer and make sure there's no
like like there's not too much product
in one place and not in the other so
then I'm using the Make Up For Ever HD
powder tap some of this into the lid and
then I'm taking the Sigma tapered kabuki
which just looks like this it's the f-86
swirling it into that product and since
as that pointed edge it makes it so easy
to get right under the lashes and just
Pat this in there it's just so nice it
really just gets right in there and the
brushes are so soft it's awesome
so now put this where I put some
dermablend and all that and really nose
or head just love this stuff my eyebrows
Floyd so that's that then I'm taking my
favorite powder of the moment I actually
kind of like this a little bit more than
my cover talks Tim powder because it
does keep me matte so it's the
Maybelline Dream matte powder this is in
sand medium oh one and I'm taking this
brush this is from the mr. bunny
collection and this is the large powder
F
thirty and if you don't know you can
also buy Sigma brushes individually as
well so if you don't want to buy that
whole sets you don't have to I'm just
going to apply this all over my face
just just set everything nicely doing it
and then I'm going to take my bronzer
which is I'm using lately the hoola
benefit bronzer I've been really liking
this again I just kind of go back and
forth with products so I have I just try
to get through some you know what I mean
taking the Sigma angled kabuki this is
the f80 for just kind of a thicker
angled brush thicker and I put it in the
product and this product is pretty
pigmented so just be careful and I'm
going to lightly contour with it so I'm
just gonna go right in the hollows like
that and then bring it up so just like
that just to add some definition to the
face
and looks really nice I like this
bronzer a lot I need about full size
everybody raised about it for a reason
it's because it's awesome then I'm just
gonna take two different blushes these
both are from Rimmel this one is spring
flower and this one's autumn catwalk I'm
gonna take spring flower first with the
Sigma large angle contoured f40 and I'm
just going to apply this on my cheeks
I like this color because it adds some
color but it's not too crazy you
probably can't tell on camera but I love
this color it's a really subtle blush
and then of course the Rimmel autumn
catwalk I'm just put this on top just to
add some color
so that's it that is my flawless face
routine without foundation you can see
the redness and acne and stuffs covered
up so I really really like it
thank you guys so much for watching
don't forget to like the video if you
liked it and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
