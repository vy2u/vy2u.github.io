an updated everyday makeup routine this
is what I do when I want to apply makeup
I either wear makeup or don't wear
makeup I don't do like tinted
moisturizers or anything like that and
like mascara I either do this full glam
or I'll do no makeup so this is like my
everyday makeup routine I don't do it
every day but if I want to do like a
lighter makeup look this is what I do of
course you could take these products and
like - and things out adjust it to your
everyday life and what you like to put
on your face for everyday I know not
everybody likes to wear false lashes but
I love these false lashes I also have a
new favorite drugstore foundation that I
am obsessed with by Sonia Kashuk I am
loving it you guys is so nice it is a
little too dark for me you're gonna see
in the video it's a little too dark okay
a lot too dark but I put some concealer
on and look we look fine now we look
fine now I really do love it I need to
go get some more colors because it is
absolutely amazing and I just show you
guys all the products I'm really loving
this is the kind of makeup look that I
wear when I'm doing my blogpost so this
is very long wearing looks great in the
photos that I take and I just really
love it I love the way my skin looks and
the way that it feels when I use this
makeup routine if you want to see how I
got this makeup look then just keep
watching I hope you enjoy it and if you
try any of these products out definitely

description box and if you want to get

just click the little bill right beside
it and that will get you notified to get
my videos whenever I upload so if you
want to see my everyday makeup tutorial
in my favorite products of the moment
then let's just go ahead and get started
okay so I already prepped and moisturize
my skin but I needed to put some primer
water on because my face was feeling
pretty dry so I kind of like drenched
myself in this you don't have to use
this many sprays but I'm a little
excessive so next we're moving on to the
Natasha de Nonna magic primer I'm really
loving this for my oily skin it does
help keep everything balanced and nice
and moisturized and just looking really
good
now I'm going in with my Sonia Kashuk
matte foundation thing is called a satin
matte foundation this is amazing you
guys is so lightweight in full coverage
I am so in love with it and I'm happy I
tried it I mentioned in a snapchat a
while ago which if you don't follow me
you should totally follow me on snapchat
but I was going back and forth with if I
should try it or not and I'm so glad
that I did because it is beautiful then
I'm taking my Tarte concealer since you
can tell that this foundation is way too
dark I'm going to use my concealer to
help you know even this out make it a
little again I'm putting this one on the
tip of my nose and also underneath my
eyes then using my Too Faced Born This
Way concealer on the rest of the face
Too Faced Born This Way concealer
definitely has lighter coverage and it
feels a little bit lighter on the skin
but I like Tuesda Tarte one more in the
inner part of my eye just to really
cover up those dark circles and give me
a full coverage finish so I'm using a
japanesse community blender which I love
you can get it from Ulta there's like a
set for it it's like $18 you get a big
Beauty Blender like this a mini one and
a cleanser for $18 which I feel like
it's a great deal I've been really
loving this japonesque sponge it feels
just like a pro Beauty Blender you
should check it out because it's pretty
amazing
weighing in with my favorite powder the
flower Beauty powder in lo1 I love this
so much you guys I've already went
through a full one if you will follow me
on snapchat see follow me on snapchat
and you'll know these things I already
went through a full ton of this amazing
it's my favorite then I'm using this
Ulta contour kit which I got not too
long ago and I'm going to bronze my neck
first because I needed a little color
down there
then we're going in with brows I'm using
benefit Cobra in number three I've been
loving this for the longest time you
guys I just think it's so easy to work
with and it makes my brows look nice and
full and it's really natural as well I
like this Sephora brush that I'm using
it with because it does have a spoolie
on the end so it makes it really easy to
apply it then blend it out another thing
with this product is it's really easy to
blend and it lasts for the longest time
number three is my perfect color you can
tell I have some blonde in my hair but
this is perfect it's not too warm not
too ashy is just right there in the
middle and it looks great and it's just
so quick for me to do my brows it's the
best that I've ever used now I'm using
the 3d brow tones this is awesome this
basically highlights the brows and makes
them look a little bit more natural it
literally gives your brows highlights
it's awesome but it sounds kind of weird
but it makes your brows look super
natural and I love it
so now I'm dusting away the baking that
I just did and then we're going to go in
with a contour I'm not going to bronze
since my skin is pretty dark right now
due to the foundation so I'm using that
same Ulta contour kit and I'm just going
to use the two colors and just contour
my face with this I am using my NARS
eita brush to apply end out with my duo
fiber brush this is the MUA one that you
can get from CVS it's really awesome a
great great brush and I use it
constantly and then I'm going to go in
with that japonesque Beauty Blender and
take the yellow highlight shade in this
palette and I'm just going to put this
underneath that contour to bake that
area and really lighten it up so then
when we dust it away that contour is
nice and sharp and it's not dragged down
towards the jawline using this Ulta
Velvet blush and princesses to be
perfect everyday color for me I love it
I'm going to just put this on my cheeks
and then a coarse blend it out again and
then we are also going to be using a new
highlight palette that I'm really
enjoying right now this is the tardis
Pro glow I do really like it only use
these two shades right here so I mean I
don't know if I would like repurchase it
again because only use the two shades
but it is a really great palette it's a
nice smooth powder and it highlights the
face beautifully and I really like those
two colors that I showed you guys but
I'll never use the cream contours in the
palette now moving on I'm going to curl
my lashes and put on benefit roller lash
my favorite mascara honestly ever it's
so good I'm obsessed with it and you
probably haven't seen me use a different
mascara in a long time I'm using this
makeup forever lipliner and going to
line my lips I'm using a new cream lip
stain today that is absolutely amazing
you guys these are new EXIF aura they
have a ton of different colors I've
talked about on before the video either
it's gonna be up before this one or
after but I'm so obsessed with them this
color is so beautiful I'll leave it down
below but what I love is that they're so
lightweight they are a matte lip stain
but I mean it doesn't feel drying
whatsoever you can barely feel it on
your lips this changes the game for me
like this is giving the smashbox ones a
run for their money because i am loving
this so far so
that is it and then if I'm filling it
I'll put on false lashes which I will
leave the links for the ones I like to
use down below you can get them from
Ulta they're the I'll or ones that I'm
obsessed with so thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you enjoyed this
video and I will see you guys in my next
one bye make it to the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
