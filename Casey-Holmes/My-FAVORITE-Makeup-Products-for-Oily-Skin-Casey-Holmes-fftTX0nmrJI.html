a product recommendation video and its
product recommendation for oily skin
that was a lot but I'm here to share
these products with you guys because I
know I'm on the struggle bus to of
having oily skin having oily skin sucks
and I know having dry skin sucks
and it's just a hard thing to deal with
but I am you're getting pig and I'm down
for trying new products to help find the
best stuff to recommend to you guys and
I feel like I have a good round up of
products here so I wanted to share them
with you and if you have any product
recommendations then leave them down
below in the comments because I would
love to try some new products and I'm
sure a lot of other people would too so
yeah if you want to see all the products
that I recommend for oily skin then just
keep watching okay so the first one is
this makeup forever step 1 primer this
is the mattifying primer I like this a
lot the only thing that I would
recommend is to put this in the areas
where you are super oily like I'm
talking shiny within minutes and for me
that's right here in my cheek area right
here in the middle of my eyebrows and on
my chin because if you apply this to an
area that is not as oily one's a little
bit dry it will ball up and kind of just
look weird under your foundation and
give you this like super weird texture
so only apply it where you're super
super oily and it will keep you Mac
throughout the day this is like my
spring/summer primer because when I just
can't find anything to help me in the
hot months this one usually does it for
me so this is the make up forevers step
one mattifying primer I love it ok this
next one is not necessarily something to
keep you matte but it's really great and
moisturizing your skin and not making
you overly oily so this is a Too Faced
hangover RX replenishing a face primer
you can see I love this stuff I just
love this because it has coconut water
in it electrolytes and probiotics and it
is silicone free it's just so good it
really moisturizes your skin but it
doesn't overdo it and make you shiny
like it sinks into the skin really
quickly it makes everything feel nice
and plump and ready for foundation so I
love this a lot I have very oily skin
and I have a
any issues with it so definitely check
this out if you're looking for something
that's really going to plump up the skin
and make it nice and moisturized but not
overly oily for your foundation okay and
these next two primers are the ones I've
been using for a few months now I just
love them I'm on my second bottle of
this or two of this this is the Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer and this
is the pore minimizing one and this is
oil free
nvm oily skin oil free is key just
because you don't want that extra oil or
stop it can make you break out because
oily skin is prone to breakouts and
things like that
and then second of all you already are
producing so much oil you don't need
extra oils are all that jazz on your
skin you know what I mean
so oil free is key and I really really
like this I apply it right in my t-zone
and I just rub it all over I don't
really put it on the outer parts of my
face just because I don't feel like I
need it there but yes I love this and in
conjunction with this I love these
matchbox a photo finish primer water
silicone alcohol and oil free I spray
this first all over my face just to kind
of like replenish the skin and get it
ready for this primer and then
foundation and I just find these two
together are a dream team and I just I
love them they're just so good it's so
awesome and is pore minimizing and since
I do have oily skin I do have larger
pores around my cheek area comes with
the territory
what are you gonna do I've learned to
accept it so it's nice to have a pore
minimizing primer in the mix of this
okay so now I'm going to share
foundations with you guys and I do have
three high end and I have one drugstore
and I just find that high-end more
high-end brands cater to oily skin more
than drugstore in my personal opinion
and they look better on the skin but the
one from the drugstore that I really do
like is the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
foundation it says it's a 24 hour
foundation but i don't recommend wearing
your foundation for 24 hours but it's a
demi matte finish
err light oil-free and yeah it's just a
semi matte foundation so it's not going
to be like flat matte on your face
I like flat matte don't get me wrong but
I also like siming that as well and yeah
I really like it it does last quite a
while on my skin I would say about eight
hours I wouldn't necessarily go over
that but out of all the drugstore
foundations for oily skin I think this
one is the best and the one that has
worked best for me
so I love this a lot and if you're on a
budget and just want something really
convenient and quick these are at pretty
much every single drugstore
moving on to high-end this foundation is
one I have recommended to you guys for
years now I just love it it's beautiful
it's amazing and then is the Estee
Lauder Double Wear foundation this is a
very high coverage intense foundation
and if you're go if you go too overboard
with it it will look cakey and it will
look very foundation II but I love this
with a Beauty Blender I love it with a
brush I've gone through multiple bottles
of this stuff and it's just amazing I'm
actually almost out of this one can you
see that yeah and I get a lot of
questions about this pump this pump is a
Mac foundation pump and it fits these
foundations perfectly which I highly
recommend going and spending the extra
money on it just because pouring it out
will waste some product but this
foundation is like a 24-hour foundation
I'm not even joking well I was okay I'm
live I would say probably like 15 hours
16 hours I would have this foundation on
I don't know it's so long wearing like I
will fall asleep with this foundation on
my face sometimes and I wake up and my
face looks awesome like it's so crazy
this does not move okay I love it I've
had a lot of people say that this like
flashbacks in photography though it
makes a white cast on your face I've
never had that issue but just full
warning you it's what I've heard oh just
test it out before if you're going to a
formal event or something and use this
just test that with your own flash
beforehand and see how it works on your
skin and then this one is when I've been
using so much recently someone I have on
now and I just love it it is the Too
Faced Born This Way absolute perfection
foundation this one is oil free as well
and I'm in the shade warm beige it's
what I have on and I just love this
foundation this one does have a pump on
it it just looks like your skin but I
don't know it's like a semi matte finish
as well it's not flat matte at all it
looks like your beautiful natural skin
to me it provides full coverage and
I just love this foundation so much I
can't get away from it right now it's
just what I've been reaching for and I
love it and it keeps me that for a long
period of time just as long as I said it
if I do not set this foundation which I
mean with any foundation if I don't set
it it's not gonna last as long and it's
not gonna look as matte but oh I
honestly didn't have that high of hopes
for this foundation I tried it fell in
love favorite way to apply it is with a
Beauty Blender though because I have
rosacea so I feel like the Beauty
Blender really helps it cover up to a
full coverage finish the last one I want
to talk about is this Lancome I'm not
gonna be able to is right tints Idol
Ultra 24-hour makeup wear and comfort
retouch free this is kind of like the
same thing as the Estee Lauder Double
Wear this can look a little intense if
you apply too much or your and you just
have a heavy hand with it but if you do
a light coverage of it with a Beauty
Blender or something it will look so
good on the skin and it will last for
ever
I think double or lasts a little bit
longer but this one does last a really
long time and it does have great
coverage so if you don't want to try
Estee Lauder definitely try it Lancome
and it's a great foundation okay I only
have two concealers to share with you
guys the first one is just a given but I
wanted to shout it out just in case
you've never seen my videos before and
you have no idea that I love this it's
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer this is
amazing amazing amazing underneath the
eyes but I also take my concealer down
in like a triangle this does not make me
more oily so that's why I really love it
the coverage is amazing and it lasts so
long if you use this an Estee Lauder
Double Wear together your makeups not
moving for the rest of it guarantee you
so I absolutely love that and then
another one I love this one is not as
long wearing but I do like it for like
lighter days and this is the Urban Decay
Naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer
and I just like this it's not oil free
or anything but it doesn't you know make
me even more oily around my cheek area
which is what I appreciate so that is
that so I'm in the shade medium light
and I really do like this like I said I
I prefer the Mac Pro Longwear over it
but I do like this one as an alternative
I think it's really nice
so glassed three things I wanna mention
to you guys are powders and the first
one is what I'm wearing now and I've
been using this for such a long time I
can't even
remember when I got this it's been so
long I have a travel sized one that I
keep in my purse but it's the laura
mercier loose setting powder and this in
the shape translucent I love this stuff
it gives you such flawless skin and it
makes you so mad I personally like to
apply it with the Beauty Blender so
after I put my concealer on I will take
my Beauty Blender dip it in here and
press it into the areas where I want to
put powder so it usually just all in my
t-zone and of course under my eyes to
set that concealer and I let it sit
there and then I take a little duo fiber
brush like this and just kind of dust
off in the excess and it gives a very
smooth matte finish which is what I
appreciate and you can apply even just a
little too much of this but dust it away
and it'll look fine so highly recommend
it is worth the money one from the
drugstore that I really love is this elf
perfect finish powder
it's the perfect HD powder I'm sorry and
it's just a powder like this it's just
it's white but it's translucent like it
just blends out into your skin but this
gives a really really nice finish to the
skin kind of minimizes the look of pores
keeps you matte and of course it's
translucent so I mean I use this all
throughout the year when I'm really tan
when I pale any time of the year it's
just awesome to have in my purse and
this comes from ELF so it's an
affordable brand and I just I really
like this a lot I think it's great I
usually keep this in my purse so that's
why you guys don't see in my videos as
much but it's a perfect touch-up powder
or to set your makeup with and the last
product I'll recommend to you guys is my
holy grail powder so absolutely stunning
it is expensive but it's stunning I
recommend this to everyone because it's
amazing and it is VG washi powder and
it's the matte and translucent finish
this is in the shade Universal nude and
I love this powder you can see I've been
beating it up because I keep this in my
purse as well I just I love this powder
it's such a fine powder I had to take my
puffs out of it so now it's everywhere
it's such a fine powder that it's
undetectable but it keeps you so stinkin
matte I love it it just fluff into the
skin so nicely I mean out of fluff is
the word more like blend it blends into
this
really nicely but it's such a fine
powder it's even more fine and then this
laura mercier one in my opinion i am so
obsessed with this and i would never
recommend something so expensive to you
guys if it wasn't a miracle worker okay
