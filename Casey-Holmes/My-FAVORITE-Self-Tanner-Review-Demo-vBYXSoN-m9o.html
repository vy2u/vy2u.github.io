the self tanner video which is obviously
on the Sun guidance that I talked about
in my video about me cancelling my
membership and stuff and if you haven't
seen it I will link it right here as
they always do um but okay my model is
disgustingly like dirty but oh and
there's a hair I absolutely love this
stuff if you saw that video you know
that I was raving about it I was so
thrilled there was a picture that I took
on Instagram of my legs how dark they
were when I just applied it I absolutely
love this stuff
if you kind of don't know my background
of tanning I am like I used to be a
religious tanner like I've always had to
be tan I still do I love to eat and it's
just I feel more confident when I do but
I used to lay in tanning bed all the
time for years I'm outside tanning all
that kind of stuff so I have a really
have a fake fake background and when I
had this sent to me I was like uh I'm
not a huge fan of the self-tanning
lotion so we'll see and it came so cute
and I had they gave me ten samples as
well when I gave that to my boss because
she loves self-tanning and she's
actually fair skinned and she used this
and she absolutely loves so if you're
fair-skinned um I do believe you can use
this but they do send you a pair of
gloves and it's just kind of wrapped
around the nozzle like in a cute little
pink bag or whatever it is in dark and
if you guys don't know that this brand
is cruelty free which I absolutely do
love the smell it's not like a bad smell
but it's definitely a scent but it
doesn't smell like you know the really
nasty self tanners um I absolutely love
this stuff for me
it lasted for a week I like to be dark
so about a week
alch exfoliate again and then I reapply
the stuff which I did today and like I
said in my other video absolutely I love
this stuff it does have a really dark
color guard which you can see on the
bottle and one little tip I haven't
pushed it down and locked it yet but you
definitely want to lock this nozzle
because if not it starts stripping out
the top so usually if you know you're
gonna do your last pump or your last
application just push it down and then
twist it so it's not it locks and
you won't lose any product when this
self-tanner starts wearing off it's not
blotchy or anything like that it's just
a nice even like I don't know it just it
doesn't do what a lot of other self
tanners does because sometimes certain
parts of your self-tanner on your body
will fade more than the other parts so
you kind of get blotchiness going on
this one doesn't do that at all so I
really really really love that I
definitely paid attention to that part
when I was going throughout the week
testing it out and stuff by the way this
does leave you like a like a all lived
tan like at least like a more of a olive
tone color I think it has like a green
base to it or something because when it
like really really dries on the bottle
it's like green it's really weird
I saw XOXO LLC saying that this was a
really good exfoliator and i tried it
and i really really do love it so i used
this in the shower and i use it with my
pink loofah also i do not tan my face i
just do it literally from my jawline
down because i don't know if it'll break
me out or not and i really don't want to
see if it will I feel like I've laid
entertaining then when I apply this
stuff and that's a really really really
really really big deal if you want to
have my ring on it's because I literally
just applied this stuff I leave mine on
for a long time like after I apply it I
don't do anything at least for like 12
hours like no sweating no shower nothing
like that so like going to bed and
waking ups a good amount of time and
then just wash it off and you'll see in
the shower the color guard come off
that's not your tan coming off your skin
that's just the color guard so yeah I
highly recommend this stuff I do have an
application little thing I'm going to
show you guys it's just on one arm and
one leg so I hope you guys go and check
this out Sun Goddess was super super
nice and decide to let my subscribers
have 10% off the link is going to be my
username which is it's blondie I will
link it all down below I think this is
like thirty nine dollars or something
like that close to forty but I think
this is the best up tanner I've ever
tried in my life I just I don't know I
love how dark it makes you and you know
I think I'm dark now after just applying
it but seriously like tomorrow I'll be
like oh my god so dark I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope you find it
kind of helpful if you have any other
questions please just let me know down
below and I will see you all in my next
one bye
I haven't self in a song but I have this
arm you can kind of see the difference
doing and escorting just a bit in my
hand and I'm going to just rub it all
over
and with this stuff you really want to
work quickly and I usually focus from
the wrist up
and you could see my hands a lot lighter
stuff all I do for that is my squirt
just a little bit and you rub it between
the fingers on the gloves and I feel
like I have too much I kind of taste
like super dab it a little bit and I
like to just run this over my hand all
my fingers and two little crevices right
here and don't forget those around you
remember don't want to get your palm
because your palms never like super tan
just kind of all-around good thing about
the color guard as you can see where
you've missed and you could kind of rub
it out it's one thing I do love that
this color guard is super dark so you
kind of see where you're putting it
those are my arms with self tanner okay
so with cookie I'm going to show you how
to do your leg I have already done this
one and now we're going to start with
this life so I do it kind of different
for my legs I just sort of support
through our legs and while you've done
it so much but this is going to cover
the entire leg and reach
and I go over my feet it's pretty
Monaco's and I load it back here just so
it kind of like water up a natural
stance
oh that's my leg debris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
