my full coverage foundation routine if
you kind of have been watching my
channel you know that I don't wear
foundation everyday I finally found a
full coverage foundation routine that I
love for what if I just want that
flawless complexion or if I'm going out
or something like that I've finally
finally found it
thank the Lord and I'm also going to go
ahead and tell you I'm using a drugstore
foundation see Revlon Colorstay
foundation for combo oily skin and fresh
beige and I feel like I have some
explaining today because I've always
since I started my channel said I hated
the color safe foundation because I
tried it probably like a year ago and I
did I absolutely hated it then I don't
know what it was about the foundation
but it was just freakin horrible but
recently I just went and picked it back
up and I tried it again and I was like
oh my gosh I love it like I don't know
the coverage the finish how long it
stays on it's just been really really
amazing and the concealers I use have
been great - I've been trying out new
ones and the ones that I show you today
have been amazing so I'll show you my
foundation concealer blush and bronzer
and I think that's all I show you so if
you're interested in seeing how I get
this full coverage face then just keep
watching okay so I have applied my
skincare products if you want to know
what they are I will put them in the
downbar but I don't know if you guys can
tell my face is lighter than my chest
because I do self-tan and the foundation
I'll be using today is the Revlon
Colorstay foundation this is in fresh
beige this is for combination oily skin
so put on the back of my hand
I had like a completely horrible
experience the first time I use this
foundation and put it on the back of my
hand because it like all came out and I
was like oh my god okay so I'm taking my
crown brush this is like a buffer brush
I don't know exactly what they call this
and there's not a name on it but it is
from crown brush I'm just going to put
it in the foundation and I don't use a
primer because I have never found a
primer that I like at all and that
actually does what it's supposed to so
no primer for me but just going to put
this on my skin lightly underneath the
eyes
and I kind of work in sections with this
foundation because like everybody says
it does dry superfast and have hairs
like sticking to my foundation that
working pretty quickly with this do same
top six time
and like I don't know if I said this but
I don't do this every day um it's just
just when I want a flawless finish and I
like this a lot
blend down to your neck so have your
lines a little bit on the ears
because I was like I'm like killing my
eyeballs but I promise I'm not thin my
forehead I just kind of buff it all out
down my nose
I promise I'm not like super tugging my
face it just looks like because it's
precious so dense it's like crazy so
this foundation is really great at
covering but I still see some redness
peeking through and if you have like um
acne or something or you have a recent
breakout then you would want to put a
seal on top what I'm going to do is I'm
taking my dermablend concealer this is
in sable I love this for my redness I
got this just last week and I've been
loving it so I'm going to apply this on
the back of my hand as well and I'm
going to use that same brush shedding
hate that um I'm going to apply on my
cheeks and just blend it um most of my
redness is on my cheeks but I'll take
any excess I have and just put it in my
t-zone because I get rid of my t-zone
also so but this is a really fantastic
concealer I love it a lot
I then take any excess go kind of on my
t-zone
just like that okay so that part's done
and now we're going to do under-eye
concealer and for that I'm using my
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer this
isn't light golden obviously my favorite
concealer for underneath the eyes I'm
going to do one honey the difference
because it's insane so do this I did
this I first oh god that's way too much
oh no I'm taking my ring finger and I'm
just going to blend this I always tell
you guys to pat your concealer so again
Pat your concealer in it just covers a
lot better it just looks better so but I
am going to kind of take a little bit
into a triangle just so I get that
highlight effect and take a little bit
up like that then just Pat don't forget
to go in the inner parts of your eye I
kind of switch out between my middle
finger and my ring finger when patting
this in because one finger usually has a
lot of product on it and the other ones
usually pretty clean so I know I mix the
match and it tends to blend it in really
nicely so a little bit as my nose - I
like like the tip of my nose to be
highlighted as well then I'm going to
take that same brush I used for my
foundation and just kind of blend any
edges I'm also going to Pat it as well
so can you see the difference is it
weird I can see the difference and to me
it freaks me out but I think like I'm
looking at the camera behind in the
mirror and it looks so creepy but it
like completely brightens and like
lightens that under-eye area it just
looks so nice it makes you look so awake
so I'm gonna do the other eye real quick
and I'll be right back okay so now that
both eyes are concealed I'm going to go
ahead and go in with my Make Up For Ever
HD powder with my ELF blush brush and
I'm going to set my concealer so just
underneath the eyes around the cheeks
where we put the dermablend t-zone
all of that basically anywhere we put
concealer we want to set it so
like that okay now I'm going in with one
of my favorite powders this is the
Physicians Formula cover stalks ten
powder talked about a lot just one of my
favorites I'm just going to set the rest
of my foundation with this just so
everything is nice and put in place I
hate it when brushes shed it gets on my
nerves okay now on to bronzer my
favorite bronzer lately I've been just
loving is the mac mineralize skinfinish
and give me Sun and I'm going to take
this Sedona lace brush this is the eight
one three and I'm just going to tap the
excess I'm just going to pause to my
cheeks right below my jaw and up to the
tops of my forehead so right here on top
of the forehead now I don't know if you
guys can see a difference on camera but
it's definitely bronze and looks a lot
more defined to me and I think it just
looks better so to the other side just
be careful with this skin fish because
it is pretty pigmented so you don't want
to put too much bronzer on your face
because it can also look a little orange
because this bronzer does have like an
orange tint to it so I'm also going to
drag it underneath on my neck then of
course I have to put all my favorite
blush this is the Rimmel London autumn
catwalk I love this blush I've mentioned
it a ton of times in my videos my
favorites and all that stuff okay
just taking the blush brush and I'm just
going to pop that on my cheeks just to
add some color
then taking this Ecotools I'm just going
to kind of blend those two together and
that's pretty much it thank you guys so
much for watching don't forget to like
the video if you liked it and subscribe
for future ones and I will see you all
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
