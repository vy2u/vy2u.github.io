on concealers my favorite concealers I
have one two three four five six
concealers on talked about in there I'm
going to also show you guys the two
powders that I set my concealers with
because you guys know I do it all the
time it really just helps the concealer
lasts longer so I'm gonna go ahead and
get started the first one is this NYX HD
photogenic concealer this is in glow and
I got this when I went to Ulta for the
first time and a lot of you were like
don't put that underneath your eyes it
creases and like settles into fine lines
and I totally agree I tried it out one
day and I was like oh my god this is
horrible so it does kind of settle into
the fine lines but I love this concealer
for the face it really does cover my
redness nicely and you'll be hearing me
talk about redness a lot in this video I
feel like because it's just one of those
things I'm sort of self-conscious about
and I have it right on my cheeks I just
I hate it it sucks but I don't know if
it's rosacea or if it's just you know
redness on my skin I think it's just
redness but anyways off topic this
concealer has a doe foot applicator
which I do love it just makes it so easy
to apply the concealer I could just take
it out dot it on my face blend it with
my fingers and go out the door so I do
like this a lot I think it's really
really nice and like I said it covers up
redness really well the next concealer I
want to talk to you about is the
maybelline instant age rewind this is no
stranger to the YouTube community I
personally don't use this right now
because it's way too dark I was using it
and then I kind of just got a little bit
lighter skin tone wise I'm trying to
self-tanning it is totally being a fail
but I just love this concealer because I
feel like it really does cover the dark
circles and make your it makes your eyes
so much brighter underneath and I love
it so this is really great I do have one
tip about it though if you don't have
enough product on the sponge like if you
don't twist it up enough I twist it up
to where I can see the product on the
sponge but if you don't and you start
applying it it can kind of tug
underneath your eyes which can cause
some premature aging and blah blah blah
so make sure you just twist
up enough to where you have enough
product and it'll be a smoother
application and you won't have as much
tugging so I really like this stuff this
is the Sonia Kashuk image in the
concealer I absolutely love it you can
find this at Target but the main rule
ooh but the main reason I even use this
quad is for the grain because this is
the most amazing green concealer that I
have found at the drugstore ever I just
think it looks so amazing it doesn't
have a green tint to your skin it really
just camouflages in and it really covers
up that redness that you want covered up
you get redness on your cheeks I really
recommend trying this green concealer
out because it will probably be like a
little mini lifesaver and then if you're
just really self-conscious and it
doesn't cover up like you want it you
could put like a little bit more of a
different concealer like a colored
concealer on top just tap it on top and
you're good to go so I really like this
I don't really use these two up here
because they are just too creamy for my
skin I kind of feel like they sort of
melt off my face but this one I love it
love it love it love it and then if you
didn't know this has a transparent
powder in it so you can set any
concealer while you're on the go this
one I have been using literally every
day this month I bought it at the end of
last month and if you guys don't know
I'm doing no makeup by August because I
really wanted to just use up things that
I have and all that kind of stuff and I
also ordered stuff online last month and
I just wanted to experiment more and
kind of go through my collection and use
different products but I love this I
have been using it all month like I said
this is the Rimmel match perfection
concealer and highlighter and it's in
light and this is what it looks like
this does have like a brush tip
applicator but I kind of like it just so
I can do a triangle motion and then I
literally I don't ever rub this
concealer I just tap all of it in and it
really just brightens underneath my eyes
and it really does cover my dark circles
I don't have like completely horrible
dark circles but they're there so it's
just really nice to kind of tap it in
and I'm good to go so I've been loving
this a lot I think it's really
nice okay two more concealers this one
is the time bomb from the bomb and it is
in medium this is another concealer I
use on my face I just really really
really love it it's sort of a thicker
consistency but as you can see I've made
a pretty good dent in it you want to
talk about covering up anything this
will cover up some good stuff I don't
think it looks cakey either I'll kind of
apply it around my nose any redness I
have I mainly use this one for like a
little bit of my redness and then some
blemishes I think it's awesome so I
really recommend this got this from home
look that's the only time I ever buy the
bomb stuff is when they're on the hook
or whatever I think it was like eight
dollars or less I think it was less than
that I can't exactly remember cuz I
bought it a while back I think I did a
yeah I did a video on it was a while
back but I love this concealer I think
it's great and just super convenient and
plus it has like this little tiny
packaging so you can just toss it in
your purse and touch up whenever you
feel like it this is the last concealer
my Holy Grail my baby I love it so much
is the Make Up For Ever full cover
concealer and mine is in number 10 and
this is also a face concealer for me
it's too dark to use underneath my eyes
but I love this stuff I can sweat a
bajillion gallons of sweat that sounds
so disgusting but I can sweat and this
does not budge I guess that's what they
mean by it being waterproof I honestly
have no idea but it just stays on so
well it doesn't like I have it on today
it doesn't even look like
cakey or anything like that it just
sinks into the skin and I love it so
much I know it's pricey but you get a
lot of product it's a really big tube I
don't know if you guys can really tell
on camera but it's a big tube and if
you're thinking of buying this I know
we're sort of going from summer to fall
I would think more of what color you are
in the fall and winter time
if you're planning on buying this so
therefore you can kind of get your
money's worth out of it because
personally I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna
have to go down a shade for the fall and
winter time because this just will not
be my face color I don't think so
get a color you kind of think you'll be
in the future and so you can really
start using it and um you know get your
money's worth out of it but I love this
guy love him now on to what I set to my
concealers with this is underneath my
eyes and just like if I put concealer on
my chin on my cheeks I also set that
with a powder the first one is this elf
high definition powder I love this stuff
I've mentioned it so many times in my
videos I've had it for months now and
I've used the heck out of it so it just
looks like this it is a bulky packaging
but I just keep mine like in a little
drawer that I have that's right here
underneath my vanity it does come with a
little puff I recommend keeping it
because this will really help you with
like the messiness of it and then you
just have the little sifter with all the
product tubes hello without the product
in it what I personally do is I keep the
sponge on top and when I'm ready to use
it I just flip it over and then I take
the sponge or the powder puff whatever
and I use whatever's on that powder puff
and it just really helps with the
messiness and everything like that so
love it think it's $6 on eyes lips face
comm I know they have some different
colors but mine is in transparent so
love it and then the one I've been using
every day so far this month it is the
Make Up For Ever professional HD powder
I know you've probably heard of this it
used to be read by a lot I don't really
hear about it too much now but it's just
a little jar this was 15 dollars at
Sephora and I know they have a bigger
one
that's like $30 or something like that I
would never purchase the full-size I
will probably always purchase this
little beanie thingy it's 5 grams and I
feel like the amount of product that's
in here it's gonna last me for forever
so I really love this stuff it makes
like my skin looks so smooth I guess
because it's such like a fine powder
that it just like I don't know
it's just beautiful I love it I know a
lot of people say it leaves a white cast
I don't really have a problem with that
but this stuff is amazing I totally
recommend trying it out but I use the
transparent powders the brush it I use
is the elf blush brush I love it because
it sort of has a pointed it has a tip on
it so it just makes it really easy to
get right underneath my eye and it gets
right underneath my lash line so so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video
concealers on one of my favorite things
ever I think I'm gonna try to do like my
favorite face products like powders and
bronzers and blushes and stuff like that
I'm gonna try to get like a little
bundle together and let you guys know so
if you're interested in that please let
me know and thank you so much for
watching and I will see you all in my
next video bye
