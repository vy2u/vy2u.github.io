favorite drugstore makeup products I
have a ton of stuff to show you guys
today
okay so the first thing I'm going to
start out with it's lucious so the first
one is definitely I can't find my other
one but it's the Milani minerals blush
with a brush and they just look like
this I don't even know why this is 70%
off because it's amazing
this color is in sweet rose and it's
just an amazing amazing color I love
these my Milani mineral blushes because
they're matte and they're super soft and
they're just so pigmented so and then
the next brand is definitely went wild
and I have two from them the first one I
have is I can open it Heather silk this
has been raved about so many times on
YouTube and it is a really really
amazing blush so that's it right there
it's a matte one and then this one is
pearlescent pink from Milani and this
one definitely has more shimmer in it it
sort of reminds me of orgasm by NARS
sorta it's very pretty so that's it
right there so again the wet wild and
Milani mineral blushes I highly highly
recommend them next is to eyeshadow quad
or palettes no matter what happens to my
collection with all my makeup I will
always have these two in it and they're
both my wet and wild so the first one is
vanity what you guys have probably seen
a bajillion times and greed you can do a
really really light I for the day or you
can really go heavy and just do a really
nice smoky eye so I highly recommend
these two they've always been in my
collection for like the longest time
pretty much ever since they came out so
I really recommend them next is a powder
now if you've been watching me for a
while you know that I have a serious a
love-hate relationship with physicians
formula like a lot like 99% of stuff I
tried I've absolutely hated which is
pretty sad to me because I always felt
like Milani the Physicians Formula was
like a really good brand and it is when
you find the right stuff like a lot of
stuff is crap but a lot of stuff is
really really good like this is one of
the most amazing powers I've ever tried
from the drugs
or it's the cover tops-10 powder and
this is a translucent medium I need to
go up a color but it's really nice I've
hit pan on it one thing I couldn't live
without is this bulky packaging right
here like it would be nice if people
just packaged their stuff like this
instead of all this crap this is just
like the most amazing powder ever from
the drugstore it just makes your face
look flawless I apply mine with a kabuki
brush and like it's just I don't know it
just really sets my foundation really
nicely and it just makes it look smooth
and flawless and just gorgeous so I
highly recommend this one okay I have
another transparent powder this one's
from ELF and this is just the elf High
Definition powder I don't use this all
over my face I just used to set my under
eye concealer and I really love it for
it it's just a really nice fine
transparent powder and it just I don't
know it works really well and it looks
like my under-eye is really smooth and
just flawless
next is bronzer and for that I recommend
the elf contouring a blush and bronzing
powder you of course have your blush and
your bronzer I don't really use the
blush I'm more into the bronzer for this
one it's a really nice Brown bronzer
which is what you want to look for you
don't want like an orange e bronzer but
it does have shimmer in it when you look
at it but whenever you put on your face
or swatch it you can't really tell so
yeah again with the blush I don't really
use it doesn't show up on my skin that
well but if you're into the lighter
blushes you would definitely love this
little duo right here okay I think the
most trouble that I ever have in
drugstore is finding a really good
foundation now I use my NARS sheer matte
foundation like nobody's business as
long as it's my color
I wouldn't say this one's like a Holy
Grail must-have but it's the best one I
found in the drugstore so it's the
maybelline superstay makeup just looks
like this you guys probably seen this a
ton and this is in honey beige now I did
shows in a hall way back kind of like a
few videos when I first started my
channel saying
I didn't know if I liked it it wasn't a
huge fan I've been trying it out and
I've been liking it a lot so I haven't
really been able to test the 24-hour
wear nor my makeup for 24 hours since
the husband gone like that hot outside
and I rarely wear foundation in the
summertime anyways or spring whatever
but I'm definitely gonna try this out
and see how it works hopefully it's
great it does have the no transfer stuff
so that's awesome it doesn't get on your
clothes but um so far for drugstore
that's been my top foundation definitely
four lipsticks would I show this in 15
makeup essentials and definitely
including this in my favorite drugstore
makeup this is the Revlon soft nude holy
cannoli
it's just the most amazing nude ever so
so on to mascara I do have three the
first one is the covergirl lash
perfection this is amazing it's more of
a dry mascara which I'm a huge fan of I
love more the dry mascaras and it's
really great at lengthening and
separating your lashes so I highly
recommend this one
next is the falsies from Maybelline the
packaging kinda wore off but this isn't
waterproof I love to use this on my
bottom lash line or my bottom lashes
it's really really great and I always
just walk with my bottom lashes because
like I don't like the flakiness that you
can get from the regular one so this is
really great I also have it in like the
regular formula and it's awesome as well
so I love the falsies this is the flared
by the way I'm and say that but this is
the flared version and of course have to
mention the Maybelline one my one volume
Express this is just the bomb I love it
I'd recommend that this is a primer now
I'm gonna go ahead and say I don't
recommend this for oily skin because
it's not really great for like the
summer time or whatever but like during
the winter or if you just want to wear
like concealer and powder I recommend
trying this I've had two of these is the
L'Oreal studio secret magic perfecting
base I've seen a few people talk about
this not a ton but this is great if
you're looking for a more of affordable
primer it really evens out the skin tone
and it just makes your skin
Oh smooth like it's one of the smoothest
primers I've ever tried from the
drugstore I've tried the Oh what is
their name
Rimmel is it Rimmel a primer is like
lasting something I don't know
it was tinted and it was horrible that
was the worst prime I've ever tried in
my life I haven't tried the RK anyone I
really want to because I love the brand
hard candy so I'm gonna try that out but
if you're looking for more of affordable
one I recommend the L'Oreal magic
perfecting base okay next is a
highlighter and this is the hard candy
baked bronzer in tiki and this is so
stinkin pretty it just has like the best
natural highlight ever if you look
really closely at it it has sort of
swirls of gold champagne colors is just
so pretty so I highly recommend this if
you looking for an affordable highlight
okay so the next couple things I just
have three more to show you guys the
next two are concealers the first one is
the Maybelline instant age rewind
concealer I love this one for just like
everyday use if I don't want to throw on
all of my face makeup for the day this
is definitely the concealer I go to for
underneath my eyes and a little bit
around my nose and then this one's
amazing for underneath the eyes it
covers so well and it's the Revlon age
defying concealer and this one is in
medium so I highly recommend both of
these too it's really hard for me to
find drugstore concealers that I like
and these two are definitely my go-to I
actually use these more than my Mac one
that I have so I like this a lot last
thing is eyeliner you see we talked
about this a ton as well it's the NYC
liquid liner and it's just your basic
liquid eyeliner and it has like a really
nice brush tip it's not too long so you
can really kind of have more control
it's so pigmented
and it's just amazing I think it's like
2 or 3 bucks
I can't remember but it's lasted me a
while so I highly recommend this one so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
actually have a ton of crap products I
would love to show you guys
but let me know if you even like those
videos like thumbs up this one if you
want to see a crap products video and
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video
