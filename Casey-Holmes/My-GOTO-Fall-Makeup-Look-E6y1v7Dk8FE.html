showing you my go-to look for fall very
easy nice warm eyes and of course an
intense bold lip and so many requests on
this Instagram picture that I had to
show you guys so that is what I'm gonna
doing for you today I did use the same
lipstick but I used a little bit more
night mom in with it because I just love
the combo of the lipstick I used in this
lip liner together and it really deepens
up the lips so I really hope you guys
enjoyed it's a super easy look to
achieve really hope you guys enjoy it
and you know let's just go ahead and get
on to the video
all right first off I already primed my
eyes with my regular primers I'll leave
them all down below going to go ahead
and apply some tape so I have a nice
sharp edge and then moving on to the
Lark Pro number 2 palette I'm gonna take
the color light brown and put this all
into the crease and on the lid this will
be our transition shade and just the
color we want to place all over just go
ahead and blend this out and make sure
it's nice and soft
going back into the palette we're gonna
take this color right here I think it's
called buff I can't remember but it's a
nice cream shade and it is matte so I'm
gonna go ahead and place this all over
the lid it's nothing too intense but it
just gives a nice light wash of color to
the lid
moving on to one of my favorite shadows
ever this is Bobby Brown's camel it's a
very nice warm eyeshadow it's kind of
like a warm mustard color and I'm going
to place this directly into the crease
and you want to take it all the way from
the outer corner into the inner corner
so just completely blend this out make
it as blended as possible you don't want
this to be like a cut crease look or
anything like that you just want to be
nice and soft
time to take off the tape just be really
gentle with it since the eye area is
super fragile I'm gonna take the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner in black
which has just been one of my favorites
and I'm going to do a nice thick winged
liner absolutely love how my winged
eyeliner turned out this day I was
pretty proud I was a proud mama and yeah
you just want to go ahead and do that on
both sides I have a winged liner and
lashes tutorial that I will leave down
below for you guys if you are having a
hard time with it
and then I'm gonna line my upper
waterline with a black liner and the
lashes I'm using are valeurs girl you
crazy
moving onto primer I'm taking the
hourglass mineral veil primer and I'm
placing this on the places where I get
super oily so it's just right in my
t-zone the rest of my face is pretty dry
right now so that's the only place where
I focus this primer using the ex1 and
visit where foundation I love this I
talked about it in my favorites video so
if you want to know more about it I'll
leave that video down below but I love
it it is beautiful I'm using shades 300
and 400 mix together and it gives me my
perfect shade to match my self tan
moving onto concealer I'm taking my
favorite mac prolongwear I just can't
get enough of this stuff and I'm gonna
place it underneath my eyes on my top
lip chin and forehead just to go ahead
and highlight
and then for my nose I'm taking my NARS
radiant creamy concealer and putting
this right in the center and blending it
out you will see what a huge difference
it makes just put this concealer in the
center just instant highlight and
contour right there taking the Anasazi
out contour kit I'm taking the banana
shade and setting all of the concealer I
just put on my face
now it's time to bronze up the skin one
of my favorite bronzers is this mac
mineralize skinfinish and give me Sun
I've had this for a few years and it's
just so pretty it's a very nice warm tan
color it is a little bit more on the
orange side so if you are more fair this
might pull more orange on you so I would
be very careful with it but if you're
about a medium skin tone like medium to
tan you would really like it
then using this estee lauder bronze
goddess bronzer and i'm just showing you
how big this palette is I'm going to use
this to contour and I really really like
it so very easy bronzer to blend out
moving on to blush I'm taking this NARS
blush and Lovejoy this is just the
perfect flush for this look I really
really love how it gives me that nice
flushed cheek so pretty
then I'm taking my baby my estee lauder
heat wave highlighter I love it and I'm
just going to highlight my face with
this and it gives you the most beautiful
golden glow of life
taking this deep garter net I'm gonna go
ahead and fill in my brows with that and
that was from Mac I really love how it
makes my brows look and then I'm taking
the Anastacio brow gel in brunette and
just setting my brows in place
then we're gonna take these two colors
from the lorac pro 2 palette and
highlight underneath the brow bone I
really like the way a nice highlighted
brow looks in the wintertime I just
think it makes you look a little bit
more awake and really put together
and then next we're gonna take the color
sable and we're going to use a sigma
flat definer brush and we're going to
press this color right there at the root
of our lashes and you just want to do
this all the way from the outer corner
to the inner corner
and then to blend this out we're gonna
take these same Bobby brown eye shadow
and a pencil brush and you just want to
go ahead and blend out that sable shade
it just makes it look really nice and
put together and nothing super harsh
everything's blended so I love this
combo it still gives a little bit of a
smoky look without being too
overpowering since we are doing such a
dark vampy lip then you're gonna go
ahead and put on some mascara and then
your eyes are done then I'll be taking
Mac's night moth and I was completely
out of frame with this but after you've
lined your lips you want to go ahead and
fill in the corners of your lips and a
little bit on your Cupid's bow and then
I'm gonna take Mac's diva and just place
this all over take your time with dark
lipsticks because once you mess up it's
kind of a pain in the butt to go in and
clean up so I like to take my sweet time
putting on my dark lipstick then after
that you were done I hope you enjoyed it
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video bye
Jesus
then packing waiting on the weather
thinking about you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
