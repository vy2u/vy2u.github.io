hey guys so today I'm going to be
sharing with you my everyday spring
makeup look now I want a quickly say
this isn't like a every single day
makeup look this is just one of those
days where I want to put on my favorite
products I don't want to do like a lot
of eyeshadow and sometimes I'll put on
false lashes like I have now but if I'm
just going to the gym going to the
grocery store I'm not usually doing a
full face that makeup like this this is
a really long lasting look I love all
these products so much there is some
drugstore there's some high-end don't
have to add the false lashes if you
don't want to you could totally adjust
this to however you want I really like
this look it's one of my go-to right now
if you've been watching some of my
videos I've been doing a lot of really
light eyeshadow lips and just wearing
false lashes hope you guys enjoyed this
video and enjoy seeing some of my new
favorite product want to see how to get
this look then let's just get started
with the video so the first thing I'll
use is this cuddly mattifying
moisturizer this is really nice I will
update you guys on this in a few videos
and then I'm going to apply my Smashbox
primer water my benefit mattifying gel
and also a pore minimizer and today I'm
going to be using these soap &amp;amp; Glory one
heck of a blot minimizer I find that all
these products really help with keeping
me matte and my pores looking nice and
minimized and I just like to put this
primer right where I have any texture
and a larger pores then I'm going in
with my favorite foundation of the
moment is the clinica beyond perfecting
foundation I am using the rotating brush
I showed you guys in a video not too
long ago if you want to check out that
review I will link it down below but
I've been loving it with this foundation
and even though it does take a little
bit more time once I have time on the
weekends to do my makeup and just sit
down and relax
I do like to use it
after that I'm taking this peach
corrector from urban decay and I'm just
going to put this underneath my eyes
where I have a little bit of extra
darkness and I also put it in the inner
corner of my eye and I'll just blend it
out with a Beauty Blender and this is
great I'm making your eyes nice and
bright especially before you put on your
concealer I love this because it has the
same consistency as my concealer which
is also the Urban Decay Naked concealer
and they don't cake up or anything like
that these products are so nice it's
really hard for me to get away from this
concealer because I love it so much but
I'm going to put it underneath my eyes
to highlight and cover up some darkness
again and then I'm also going to put it
in the center of my face too right in
that area up as well
once that's all blended in I'm going to
go ahead and take my laura mercier
translucent setting powder I think this
is a really huge thing for oily skin
especially during spring and summer it's
really important to bake your makeup and
this is a really great powder because
it's really nice and fine and it just
melts into the skin and once you let
this sit and then dust it away after a
few minutes it looks perfect and it does
help you stay shine free for a long time
I definitely believe in baking then I'm
going to fill my brows on my Anasazi a
dip brow in soft brown and then for
bronzer and a shadow I'm going to use
this L'Oreal glam bronze bronzer I love
this as a eyes shadow and a bronzer I
like to use the same products on my eyes
as I do my face I feel like they just
sync together really nicely
but I'm going to take this Mac brush I'm
going to blend this into the crease and
a little bit above the crease as well
I'm just kind of messy with it I want to
just add a little bit of a contour in
there to give some definition to the
eyes
you bring y'all let your team
and I'm going to line my upper lashline
to help make my lashes look a little bit
fuller and then you can go in with just
mascara right now I'm using the benefit
roller lash I really really like this
one and if you just want to do mascara
and no false lashes this is what it
looks like I think it is still really
beautiful but today I was going to be
filming so I wanted to put on some false
lashes so I'm using the velour fluff in
whispies you guys know I love this
they're just my favourite lashes so far
then I'm going to take that same L'Oreal
bronzer and just bronze my skin up and
I'm using the benefit brush if you guys
are interested in any of these products
I will try to link everything down below
in the description box for you so I'm
going to put this on the tops of my
forehead to really bronze and make me
look tan and I'm also going to put it on
my cheeks and a little on my chin and my
neck
for contour i'm using this makeup
revolution contour palette this is a
really really great palette and I'm also
using the Real Techniques contour brush
and I'm just going to carve out my
cheekbones this palette blends really
well and using this brush with it it's
so easy and it's really quick as well I
just love this combo I'm also in the
contour underneath my lip and on the
tops of my forehead I'm also going to be
blending with this mu a professional
stippling brush I wanted to show it to
you guys because I got it from CVS and
it's a really great duo fiber brush then
I'm using a makeup revolution blush
palette and hot spice I'm going to mix
these two blushes and put them on my
cheeks these are great everyday colors
and they are so pigmented and blend out
very very well and I'm just going to
take that MUA brush again and blend
everything so we don't have any harsh
lines using my new favorite highlighter
this is the lorac daylight highlighter
I'm going to use my on saadia brush
which I am loving for a highlighter
lately it is so nice and I'm just going
to put this highlighter on the tops of
my cheekbones down the bridge of my nose
and also on my Cupid's bow I like this
highlighter because it really gives you
that really pretty summer spring glow
I'm also going to take that same
highlighter and put it underneath my
brows and the inner corners of my eyes
then for my waterline I'm going to take
this NYX wonder pencil this is like a
skin tone color liner and it makes your
eyes look nice and bright without
looking too stark and white so I love
this and then I'm going to take this
waterproof better than sex mascara from
Too Faced and put that on my lower
lashes because my eyes tend to get
really watery in the spring and summer
so I have to put waterproof on my bottom
lashes for sure then I'm going to take
the kylie jenner lip kit Dulce Kay lip
liner and will line my lips with that
and then top it off with literally gloss
from her as well I love this combo they
are really pretty and lasts a really
long time so I would definitely check it
out if you get the chance and then after
that that is it for this makeup look so
I hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so
much for watching don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and like I said I'll have
everything listed in the description box
below and I will see you all in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
