a tutorial on this look it's just my go
to fall makeup look it's really easy and
I just I love it it's one of my favorite
go-to looks and a lot of you masca me
and my recent videos what I've been
doing and this is very similar to my
other dark lip tutorial that I did which
I'll link down below but it's really
light eyes and just a super vampy lip I
wanted to show you guys how I take rebel
rebel is a really nice shade it's a
little bit lighter than what I have on
right now but I'm going to show you how
I get it to be really dark and vampy I'm
just obsessed with having really dark
lipstick on lately I just think it's
great
and I get a lot of compliments on my
lips when I go out so I figured I would
show you guys and it's just my go-to
it's easy it's fun and you're just
focusing on having big bold lips I will
be having more drugstore tutorials for
you guys and more kind of different
tutorials I want to do one with the
Sigma macaroon palette because I
actually use that in a video a while
back and I really liked the way it
turned out bigger I would show you guys
this because it's been requested a lot
so I did not do my foundation and
concealer in this video mainly because I
am currently doing a first impression on
the foundation I'm wearing but if you
want to know what I usually do I'll put
my current foundation routine down below
and you can follow that if you would
like so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to thumbs up this video and
subscribe to my channel to see more
videos from me and I will see you in my
next one okay so since we have
foundation and concealer on I'm going to
set my concealer with this Mac prep and
prime translucent setting powder and my
Sigma f80 brush I will have everything I
mentioned in this video in the
description box below I'm also going to
set my face makeup with this NARS powder
in mountain and I'm just going to press
this into my skin not really rub I like
pressing just so my foundation doesn't
like go everywhere and just kind of
smear all over the place now I'm taking
my Bobbi Brown bronzer and golden light
in my Mac 134 brush and I'm just going
to bronze up the skin
now we're gonna contour even more I'm
taking these two brushes and my benefit
hoola bronzer and the first brush I'm
gonna take is my Mac 109 and I'm just
going to use this to hollow my cheeks
out a little bit more I love having a
strong contoured face with a really dark
lip it's just my favorite I think it
looks so good together now I can't
remember the name of this brush but I'll
put it down below and this is what I've
been using to contour my nose I just dip
it into the bronzer to tap off any
excess and also push any excess on the
back of my hand and contour my nose I
mean I don't have it perfect yet I'm
still trying out different techniques
but so far this is why I've been doing
it's been really easy so I do like it um
after I put that on my nose I'll just
blend it out with my face powder and
this yeah what is it Mac 224 brush
so now we're going to take that bronzer
and put it right underneath our bottom
lip it's just gonna help make it look a
little bit more pouty and full and for
blush i'll be using mac's Melba I highly
recommend this blush especially if
you're a first-time buyer at Mac I think
this is one of the best blushes to get
because it literally goes with every
look now I'm taking my Mac Paint Pot in
soft ochre and priming my eyes at this
as you can see I've hit jar on this bad
boy and I'm getting pretty excited
because I'm going through quite a bit of
products lately so now I'm taking my
bronzer which is the hoola benefit and
I'm going to put this into my crease you
can use any brush that you want I'm
using the Mac 224 and this will be the
only shade we use on our eyes because I
just wanted to add a little bit more
depth to the look and now I'm going to
be filling in with my honest Asya brow
Wiz and I do have a whole brow routine
if you wanna check that out below the
only thing that's different is that I'm
using the Anastasia brow pencil instead
of the brow powder now I'm setting my
brows with the Anastacio brow gel in
brunette and combing it through with a
spoolie
after curling my lashes I did tightline
which means I took a black liner and
line my upper waterline it'll just make
your lashes look a lot more full and
then I'm going in with my Wyatt cell
baby doll mascara that I'm obsessed with
you guys know I love this stuff I'll
have a full review on it for you guys
very very very soon and there's Daisy
and now for the fun part it's lift I'm
gonna take Mac's
lipliner in night moth which is a
current obsession of mine I love this
color
it's a lot darker than rebel and this is
what's gonna help make rebel look a lot
darker than it actually is so I'm just
going to line the outer half of my lips
and you can go like this in public if
you want I mean do what you do and now
I'm going to fill in the outer half as
well with my mouth just to make it a
little bit more deep on the outer
corners of my mouth then I'm going to
take a NYX lip liner in deep purple and
I'm going to fill in the rest of my lips
in the center it'll kind of create the
ombre look but not really just a little
bit and I'll take Mac's rebel and put
this all over and it helps blend
everything together and then to deepen
it up even more I'll take my moth again
and just kind of put this on the outer
half of my lips and kind of fade it in
so it kind of has that ombre effect but
I'll give you guys a tutorial on more of
a ombre lip very very soon so that's it
guys I hope you enjoyed the video please
