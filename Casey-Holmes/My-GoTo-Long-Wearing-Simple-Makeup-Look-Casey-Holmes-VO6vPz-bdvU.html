my go-to long-wear simple makeup look
and I don't know about you guys but
lately I have just been loving a full
face of makeup if I'm going to do makeup
if I'm not gonna do makeup then I will
just skip it for the day but lately when
I've done my makeup I wanted it to be
long wearing because I've been doing it
early in the morning and haven't been
able to touch up throughout the day to
go out at night though I've just been
doing this really simple look and I
figured it was the perfect time to
include this foundation from NARS it is
the all day luminous weightless
foundation this is new on the market
really excited about it I haven't told
you guys that I've been using it because
I've just been kind of trying it out as
I've been moving in stuff but I'm so
excited to share this foundation with
you guys so you basically get like a
two-in-one video of the review of the
foundation and also a really simple
tutorial if you want to see a review on
this foundation and this makeup look
then just keep watching okay so starting
off I'm going to be applying a
mattifying primer and this is just gonna
help my foundation last a little bit
longer and keep me a little bit more
matte and then moving on to the star of
the show it is the NARS all day luminous
weightless foundation and this is
actually NARS first full coverage
foundation and then literally covers
your entire face with one drop and when
I say one drop I mean literally just one
pump of foundation is all you need for
your face you could probably even use
less than that so all I do to apply is
shake it up a little bit and I'm gonna
do one pump and then blend it really
well into the skin the whole key behind
this foundation and my personal opinion
is to just really buff this in it's not
gonna slide all over the place and leave
you streaky it's just really gonna sink
into the skin and they'll just give you
that really flawless full coverage
finish and as you guys know I have
rosacea and this foundations been really
nice because it does have a lighter
formula and it doesn't feel super heavy
great if you have kind of sensitive skin
and you want to use something that's not
gonna be too harsh all day and still
leave you a full coverage finish like
that's the whole point about this
foundation that I just love is it's full
coverage and it also looks really
natural on the skin you won't look like
you have cake face because it just gives
you a nice luminous glow if you have
oily skin
we worried about the luminous factor of
it I love it I've used it for a while
now and I don't even have to block when
I'm going out at night it's just perfect
the shade I've been using is Syracuse
and I've been self-tanning so it matches
pretty well and I will leave a link down
below for you guys if you want to it
check out the foundation now moving on
to the rest of the face I'm going to
take this nyx concealer and put this
underneath my eyes and the center of my
face and then Sam Smith came on and I
couldn't help myself
so I'm gonna go ahead and blend this out
and then I'm gonna take my foundation
brush and also help blend this because
it is pretty light so I'm trying to just
blend this back into my skin cuz this is
just what I'm working with for right now
so I'm gonna take this elf eye
brightener which is a nice yellow toned
powder and I'm going to set this
underneath my eyes just to brighten up
underneath there
moving on to shadows I'm gonna go ahead
and take creme brulée from makeup geek
these are all makeup geek shadows I'm
wearing because I've been obsessed with
them so I'm gonna take creme Brule and
just put this all into the crease this
eye look is super easy great for
everyday and it's just gonna make you
look put together but not overdone which
is why I love it now I'm gonna take one
of my favorite shades which I think this
is called preppy it's a green kind of
mustard color it's like a mix between
the two it is beautiful this is like my
kind of shade I love it so I'm gonna put
this into the crease and I'm just gonna
blend it all out and then she's just
gonna add a little bit more definition
right there in to the crease you don't
have to be super precise with a
and then to brighten up the eyes I'm
gonna take shimma shimma from makeup
fees which is just a nice shimmery
shadow and I'm going to put this all
over the lid and like I said it's just
going to brighten up the eyes make it
look a little bit more awake and it's
great for daytime and then after I've
applied shimma shimma all over the lids
I'm going to go back in with preppy and
just touch up the crease color I cannot
tell you guys how many times I edit it
out dancing in this whole video it's
crazy now I'm gonna take this NARS
eyeliner in via veneto and I'm going to
line my upper waterline which I don't
show and then I'm gonna line my upper
lash line with a black liner I'm doing a
really thin line and nothing crazy and
I'm not doing a winged liner and then
I'm gonna add these false lashes from
house of lashes which are beautiful I
love them and now I'm taking this BH
Cosmetics Forever nude palette and this
middle shade right here which is more on
the red side and I'm going to bronze my
skin with this
then I'm gonna take this shade right
next to it which is more ashy and I'm
going to contour my face with it so put
it in the hollows of my cheeks
underneath my lip tops my forehead and
also on my nose and underneath my jaw
that sounded in my brain that sounded
like it wasn't gonna be a lot to say but
that's a lot of contouring
then I'm going to just blend blend blend
as I go along and then taking makeup
geeks infatuation blush beautiful blush
I'm just gonna apply this to my cheeks
and right on the apples as well and then
I'm going to again just blend everything
out
then for a highlight I'm going to take
shimma shimma again and just apply this
to the tops of my cheekbones this is a
really great shadow to just use as a
all-over lid shade and also on the tops
of the cheekbones and then what do you
know I'm blending again moving on the
brows I'm using my NYX eyebrow gel I've
had a lot of people ask why I don't show
a brows tutorial I'm actually gonna do a
drugstore foundation and brow tutorial
so just stay tuned for that I'll show
you an in-depth video on how I do my
brows
if you know what I'm singing right now
please leave it in the comments below
and I will literally love you forever
now I'm gonna take I think this is
called vanilla bean I'll have the names
of everything listed below it's a matte
cream shade and I'm gonna put it
underneath my brow and then I'm also
going to take my liner from NARS again
and put this on my waterline I just love
this liner I've used it for over a year
now it doesn't smudge or anything and
that's why I use it all the time I'm
gonna take this darker brown shade it
kind of has a plum undertone to it and
you guys know I love a good smoked out
lower lash line so I'm just going to
press this up against the lower lash
line really close and then I'm going to
take preppy and blend it all out no
matter what kind of look I'm doing a
smoked out lash line and makes it for me
I have to have it then I'm gonna put
mascara on the bottom lashes into the
star of the show my favorite lip combo
so I'm gonna take this essence lip liner
and I'm going to line my lips with it
this lip liner is so stinkin creamy
beautiful and it's only a couple dollars
you guys I'm obsessed with his lip combo
like I can't stop wearing it it is
beautiful so I'm going to line my lips
and also fill them in with this lip
color and it's a beautiful plum you can
honestly leave it by itself just like
this
and then I'm gonna take this NYX soft
matte lip cream again I can't remember
the name I'll leave it down below and
I'm going to put this on top I feel like
this is a great alternative to Lolita by
Kat Von D so if you cannot get your
hands on it or just don't want to spend
the money
get this combo less than ten bucks and I
feel like it's a perfect dupe for it
just my opinion but I love it so I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
