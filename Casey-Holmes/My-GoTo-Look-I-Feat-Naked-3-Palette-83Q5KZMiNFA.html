look with a naked 3 palette this has
been my go-to look every time I reach
for this palette ever since I've gotten
it this is just the look that I go to
either I don't have enough time or I
just really don't want to do too much
and experiment with different colors so
this is what I've been using I do use
the color trick all over my lid trick is
one of those colors that is tricky
I'm surprised they call it trick because
it is a tricky color basically what I
did is I scraped the top of it with some
tweezers and now it's showing up a lot
more pigmented than it was when I first
got it I used to not be able to get any
pigmentation from that color but since I
scraped the top of it basically like a
dug in there now I can get some color
off of it so I suddenly been my favorite
color like to put all over my lid and
then of course I love the matte shades I
do really love this palette there is
quite a bit of fall on some of the
colors but all in all they are beautiful
shades and I'm really happy I got it I
was really debating on getting it
because I didn't think I needed it but I
actually got rid of my naked 2 and I was
like you know what I like these colors
and since I've been using them on my
eyes I really do like them they're
really romantic and really sexy and I
just think they look awesome for like a
date night or just like day to day use I
mean it doesn't have to be a date night
so I did go ahead and do my foundation
and stuff in this video because I filmed
my first impression that I'm putting up
tomorrow so you'll see what I have on my
face in that video tomorrow and yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching don't forget to
check out my other video that I just
posted today as well and I will link
that in the description box below and I
will see you guys in my next video bye
ok so the first thing we're doing is
priming our eyes with denars primer and
I love this it's perfect for oily
eyelids and then I'm going in with my
Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre and this is
just going to give us a nice bare canvas
to put some eyeshadow 1
I love this stuff I highly recommend it
if you kind of have like veins on your
eyes and you have a hard time covering
them up this would be the product to go
to now I'm taking trick with the sigma
e55 and i'm going to apply this all over
the lid I think this color would look
even better if you sprayed your Bush
with like fix+
something I think it would go on your
lid a lot more pigmented and kind of
have a really pretty sheen to it so I
love this eyeshadow but like I told you
in the beginning I did have to dig at it
in the palette to even get the color to
show up now I'm taking the Sigma e-40
and I'm taking the color lust
I believe I couldn't really see it just
then and I'm going to blend this into
the crease it's a really light shade but
I'm using this to help blend out the
edges of that trick I shadow next we are
going in with nooner and this is a
really pretty matte shade it's just a
little bit darker than lust and I'm
going to put this into the crease and
even a little bit above the crease and
blend it into the outer half of the eye
as well and this is just going to add a
little bit more definition to the look
and I love this color I think it is
absolutely stunning has to be one of my
favorite colors in the palette now I'm
going in with the Sigma e-40 again and
I'm just blending out any harsh edges
and then I'm just going back in with
trick again and applying it on the lid
just to make sure that color really
stands out now I'm going to line my eyes
with my normal liners and then I'm going
to take factory which is just a little
bit darker of a shade it's not too dark
but it'll still give you that added
definition you'll want so since I put my
eyeliner on I know my guide line and I'm
just putting this color on the outer
half of the eye and focusing it in the
crease you can see there the difference
between the two it just adds a little
bit more depth not too dramatic or
anything like that but it does make a
huge difference
I forget this brush I'm using it with
but I'll leave it in the description box
below and of course I am blending out my
eyeshadow again
because I'm a blending the fanatic then
I'm going to put on my favorite mascara
and line my upper and lower waterline
with this eyeliner and I did do my brows
if you want to see a new brow routine
just let me know in the comments below
and I will do that for you going back in
with Factory in this Sigma e30 pencil
brush I'm going to put this underneath
my lower lashes just to smoke out the
look a little bit more after you've done
that we're going to apply mascara to our
bottom lashes and then we're going to
apply highlight shade this color is
strange it is so pretty as a highlight
and love it I'm going to take this color
with the concealer brush and just apply
this underneath my brows and then you're
done with the eyes is super super easy
and it looks so pretty I absolutely love
it now taking my Too Faced bronzer this
is the chocolate Soleil bronzer and my
NARS brush and I'm just contouring per
usual if you also want a contouring
highlighting blush video then let me
know in the comments as well and if you
guys are wondering where my jackets from
I'll leave the name of the place down
below now taking this color orgasm from
NARS I think this color of blush goes
perfectly with these eye shadow colors
oh my gosh I'm obsessed obsessed
obsessed
I love the combo it's so pretty and then
I'm taking the duo fiber brush and again
just blending this out and I'm taking
this essence highlighter this is like a
two or three dollar highlighter from
Ulta I like it I didn't notice a huge
amount of highlighter on my face but I
think it'd be great for day-to-day use
if you just wanted some light to reflect
off the top of your cheekbones now I'm
going in with my Sela lipliner and
aspiring and I'm just going to line my
lips and we're going to go for more of a
door--
renewed today which is my favorite thing
so I'm taking the Urban Decay Naked 2
and just applying that all over my lips
and then I'm topping it off with my
favorite lip gloss from Sigma which is
in the color hint and then is it this
easy look is done so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up if you did and check out my
other one I posted today as well in the
description box and I will see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
