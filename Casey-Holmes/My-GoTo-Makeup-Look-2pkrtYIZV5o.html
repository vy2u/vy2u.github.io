a look on my go-to look this is just
what I like to do if I cannot figure out
what I want to wear for the day or if I
just want to get my makeup kind of done
pretty quickly this is what I will go to
and I'm just using some of my favorite
shadows so that I actually mentioned in
my last favorites video so if you
haven't seen that I will leave that
video down below so just using those and
they also use quite a few different
products that I haven't shown on my
channel yet that I purchased recently
that I've just been really loving so
I'll show you guys in the video and
explain that to you but the main reason
why I like this look if I could take it
from day to night if I want to do more
of a day look I'll use these lashes
these are the kiss number one lashes I
get this little multi pack from Walmart
it's the only place I can find the multi
pack of these lashes and if I want to
make the look a little bit more on the
dramatic side I will go with these
velour lashes actually purchase these
recently and got them in last week so
I've just been playing with them and
these are by far one of my fave lashes
ever these are in the girl you crazy and
I love them they are so gorgeous and I
like them just to kind of spice up in
your look and make your eyes look a
little bit more flirty so yeah these are
very expensive but I've been really
impressed with them so far even though I
wore my last ones twice and lost them
I'm like holding on to these and hoping
then I do not lose these because like I
said they're freaking expensive so I'm
hoping I don't lose these but yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this video I'm so
sorry I haven't put out as many videos
as I usually do lately I just have a lot
of stuff going on and my personal life
but I promise to you starting this week
I will be putting out more videos for
you so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching and
don't forget to like it if you liked it
and I will see you all in my next one
okay starting off we're gonna take the
lorac Pro palette this is a little mini
palette I got in a sec from lorac I'll
leave the link down below where I got
this from I got it from Ulta and like I
said it came in a set so I'll have that
linked for you down below but I'm using
the Sigma e-40 and I'm just going to be
blending this all into my crease and a
little bit on my lid as well
going in with all my favorite shades
from Bobby Brown this is in the color
camel and I'm just going to be taking my
Sigma e25 and blending this into the
outer half of my eye and also dragging
it into the crease don't worry if this
is a little bit sloppy on the outer half
because we will clean it up later
now I did want to like wash a color on
my lid so I'm taking the Sigma eyeshadow
in the color elope it's just a nice
matte cream shade I forget the brush I
used it with but I'll have it linked in
the description box I'm just gonna be
focusing this on the first half of my
eyelid
and I'm going to take the Sigma e-40
again and just blend that out
now I'm taking my concealer you can use
makeup remover if you would like but
concealer is just what I like to go to
and I'm just going to clean up the outer
edges and keep in mind I'm not using a
lot of concealer while doing this it's a
very thin amount but yeah like I said
you can use makeup remover if you would
like to do that instead and after I do
that I'm going to just blend it in with
my finger
now I'm going back in with that camel
shade and just deepening up the outer V
and also the crease a little bit as well
taking my favorite liquid liner at the
L'Oreal infallible super slim eyeliner
I'm going to just be creating a pretty
dramatic winged eyeliner
after that more to line my upper and
lower waterline with this eyeliner and
I'm putting on this mascara from
Clinique it's just a little sample that
I had it doesn't really matter what
mascara you use because I'm going to
using false lashes and these are the
lashes I'll be using today moving on to
face I'm taking my Estee Lauder Double
Wear foundation by far one of my
favorite high-end foundations ever I'm
just obsessed with it and I'm going to
be using my Sigma f80 and just blending
this into the skin
after that is time for concealer I'm
gonna be using my mac prolongwear in NC
25 and just applying this underneath my
eyes and then blending it out with my
favorite brush from Sigma which is the
Sigma f80 six kabuki brush
now this is a product that I actually
got this day of filming it's the bare
minimal bareMinerals
stroke of light and I'm just gonna use
this to highlight the center of my face
so the top of my forehead my nose top of
my lip and also my chin area and this
was my first time using it and I have to
say I really do like it
it's nothing dramatic but it does create
a nice highlight of effect right there
to the center of your face to set
everything I'm going to be taking my
makeup forever super matte loose powder
this is in the translucent natural shade
and I'm going to be using this for my
under eyes and also my face makeup
now I've purchased a new Ron's er and
this is from Dior and it is in the
colour cinnamon and I am in love with
this I've been eyeing this bronzer for a
while and I have to say I really do love
it it is a very warm bronzer so it's
great to just bronze your skin or I even
like to just contour with it I think it
looks really beautiful so that's just
what I'm doing here
for blush I'm using this Sigma blush and
Melo by far one of my favorites mellow
and serene are just amazing and I'm
going to be applying it with my f40 I
believe I can't remember but just this
blush brush when Sigma and I'm just
dusting it on my cheekbones and also to
the apples of my cheeks and then I'm
going to blend just to make sure it's
nice and seamless
next taking this highlighter I have been
hunting this highlighter for forever and
I'm so happy I finally found it I was in
Bloomingdale's and I was at the Dior
counter and I saw this and I was like oh
my gosh I can't find this anywhere
online I'm so happy it's here it's the
Amer diamond highlight and it is so
beautiful you guys if you can get your
hands on it I would definitely recommend
it it is so stunning taking this Tarte
Amazonian clay brow mousse this is in
the color taupe this has been my new
go-to brow product I tell you guys all
the time I switch up brow products a lot
this one has to be one of my favorites
just because it's not too dark it's not
too light and I feel like my brows look
really great with this product so I've
been really really enjoying it
now I'm taking my Anastacio tinted brow
gel in Burnet just to set them in place
going in with this expresso shade from
that mini palette and a pencil brush I'm
going to be applying this underneath my
lower lashes just to smoke out this look
after that I'm taking a big fluffy
blending brush and just blending out the
edges of that shadow we just put on
going back in with camel again I'm going
to deepen up the outer V a little bit
more sometimes when I put lashes on I
want to touch things up so that is just
what I'm doing here for a highlight
color I am taking the one in that lorac
palette again this has to be my new
favorite highlight color it is
absolutely stunning
I'm just using a flat definer brush and
I'm going to apply this underneath my
brows and just blend it down a little
bit
then for lips I'm applying my Jordana
lip liner in tawny also using the MAC
lipstick in close contact which was in a
limited edition collection so I do
apologize but any lipstick can do and
then for lip gloss of using Mac's pro
long wear lip glass in patience please
and just topping that off
and then you will be done so I hope you
guys enjoyed this look thank you so much
for watching and I will see you guys in
my next video
