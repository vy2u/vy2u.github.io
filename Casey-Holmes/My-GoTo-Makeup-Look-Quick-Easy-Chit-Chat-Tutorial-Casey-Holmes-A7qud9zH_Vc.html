sharing with you this makeup look I've
had a ton of you request a natural
everyday makeup look something you can
wear to work with long lasting products
and these past couple months I have
tried a bunch of new products out and I
figured I would share with you this
makeup look I'm going to explain to you
why I love the products some details
about the products everything like that
so it's a pretty in-depth video normally
this look takes me like 15 minutes to do
but since I talked through it it
obviously was a little bit longer and I
really wanted to talk through this video
to kind of chitchat and let you know why
I love them some details and just
different things like that I hope you
guys enjoy it if you did don't forget to
give it a thumbs up and leave in the
comments below what you want to see next
if you want to see how I got this easy
everyday work appropriate makeup look
then let's just get started
so let's get started with one thing I
want to mention this is the bush of sake
cleansing water I mentioned this in my
favorites video and I use this this
morning because I don't have time to
like go take a shower
I took all my makeup off last night
rinse my body off and this morning I was
like I don't have time to shower do
anything because while I choose this
cleansing water because it takes off all
that dirt excess makeup anything like
that and you do not have to rinse this
off so I'll just take a round cotton pad
and put it all over my face get
everything that seeped out of my skin
throughout the night off and then I will
moisturize so I use this and then I used
my lemare moisturizer just to moisturize
my skin and make it really hydrated it's
so important to moisturize your skin
even if you have oily skin so this has
been my favorite there are other cheaper
alternatives this is just like this is
my baby and I take the primer water and
put this on I get like excessive with
this stuff I love it it just makes me
feel like super awake and it really does
help the makeup glide on smoothly
normally when I do a pore minimizer I
don't put it all over my face so this is
great to kind of just get the entire
face and use the pore minimizer where
you need it which for me is in my t-zone
cos I have large pores
it's just how life goes so I'm gonna
take these smashbox pore minimizer and
put this in my t-zone i like to kind of
warm it up between my fingers and then
just apply it to the t-zone now if you
don't have a problem with pores and you
have like normal to dry skin i would
definitely recommend these smashbox a
photo finish primer because
that was very rude because it really
will hydrate the skin and it keeps your
makeup on all day and it works really
well with the products that we're going
to use I think it was like the past two
or three months I've been talking about
them it is the Smashbox Studios skin
foundation I really like this because it
looks like skin it is so beautiful they
do have 22 shades they added some new
shades and they have just a huge line
but you guys it's all my blog from a few
months back when I went to LA because as
you guys know I'm doing like my own
little collab with Smashbox so I went
there and I explored the studios and I'm
not collabing with this foundation but
I'm collabing with other things that you
guys will see in the beginning of next
year which I'm so excited about but they
showed me their studios and they showed
me their light studio which is where
they have a ton of different lights like
fluorescent lights I don't know y'all
different kinds of lights that I don't
even I don't even know the words there's
a ton it was so cool see they had like
sephora's lighting ulties lighting it
was insane they formulated this
foundation to work with every single
form of life so I think that's super
cool I mean if you want to make sure you
look good in fluorescent lights at work
and then the sunlight in the day this is
what's going to work for you and it does
not oxidize I learned so much about this
foundation and I really enjoy it because
it does what it says you know what I'm
saying so I highly recommend this
foundation I think it's awesome I'm
going to be using this shade this is the
shade 2.4 and just going to pump it on
the back of my hand I'm going to use a
Beauty Blender sometimes I use a brush
sometimes I use a beauty blender I just
do it in different ways however I'm
feeling for the day today it's in the
morning time I want to use a Beauty
Blender because it's nice and cool and
it makes me feel a little bit more
refreshed I just like to pounce this all
over my skin I like to do one even layer
first and then wherever I need more
courage I'll just build up the
foundation this is a medium coverage
foundation but it is buildable so if
you're like me and you have areas that
you need to cover just a little bit more
you can build it up and it's not going
to be super drying or anything I've been
really enjoying my new skincare routine
I feel like my makeup looks ten times
better now since I've had like a really
strict skincare routine I told you in my
August area I was kind of nervous to do
it I think I'm gonna do it I'm gonna
maybe do like a morning and night
routine and just share the products I
like to use because they've made a huge
difference they're just so expensive so
the only part that sucks about it I'm
not doing like a full coverage look or
anything I'm just running errands and
like doing some traveling so this is
what is going to work for me this looks
fine and my concealer will kind of cover
up any dark circles that I have next
thing is the studio skin concealer I
love this I purchased this a couple
months ago I just busted it out this
past month because you guys know I've
been trying a bunch of new products and
this is one of my new favorite
concealers it is so comfortable looks
beautiful on the skin and it doesn't go
into your fine lines or anything like
that and it looks beautiful once it's
set as well so that's huge because
sometimes concealer can look really
drying when you said it this looks
stunning and it goes really well with
foundation I mean they're they're made
for each other the both the studio skin
line I don't know if you guys saw on
Smashbox is Instagram when they did like
a wear test of it was it Instagram or
their snapchat I don't know but they
showed how this was waterproof they like
put water on it and everything and it
stayed in place and I was mesmerised and
I went ahead and purchased it at Sephora
and I really love it it's so lightweight
and it's perfect for everyday for an
example the Tarte shake tape concealer
is great if you want to be like full
coverage full glam but this is great for
everyday but then you can also
transition this into the full coverage
look so you know what I'm saying because
it's so lightweight and it just feels
really good so for when you're working
and you're just running errands and you
don't want to feel like you have makeup
on your face this is a great combo now
when I'm running errands I do like to
take concealer on my lid if I'm actually
doing a full eye shadow look I will not
take concealer on my lid because I have
really oily eyelids and I you need to
use like a specific primer to make sure
that it's not going to go anywhere on
days like today I don't like to use my
primer because I use a NARS eyeshadow
primer and it's expensive you know so
I'm not going to waste product on my
lids when I know I'm not gonna do a full
look I'll just put some bronzer in the
crease and I'll be good to go it just
looks like skin like I love this combo
and how it looks like skin is just
amazing so now we're going to set the
face I'm going to use my flower Beauty
translucent powder I'm so obsessed with
this you guys know it I just it's such a
great perfect I recently found this this
past month
and I
just I mean I haven't used anything else
this is just such a great powder and
it's from the drugstore you can't go
wrong it's amazing to set anything with
so I'm just going to use this underneath
my eyes another great thing about this
powder is that it does have a tint to it
so it's not going to be a super
highlighted effect so when you're at
work you know you don't really want to
do like a super glam highlight contour
effect you just kind of want everything
to stay in place and this is a great
powder for that this is the shade lo1
and it makes you look amazing and
poreless and it's just phenomenal so I'm
going to let that set and just melt into
my skin and while it does that I am
going to do my brows so I'm filling in
my brows brows are super important in my
opinion and I'm using this Ulta brow
pomade I got this recently and I've been
wanting to use it so I'm just going to
put this into my brows this is in the
shade soft brown I tested it out on this
eye and it looks like it's going to be
fine
but it's a really creamy product and I
love pomades like this because it makes
it so easy at least for me to fill in my
brows whenever I try to use like a
pencil eyebrow product or whatever it
takes me literally like 30 minutes to
get my brows the way I want them to look
but pomades are just easy because I draw
them in fill it and then I'm good to go
okay now I'm going to dust away the
baking that we just did I'm taking this
anyway brush that I love you can get it
from CVS I like to also brush the powder
like on the rest of my face so it's like
I'm dusting it away but I'm also putting
it on the outer perimeters of my face
just to set everything else next I'm
going to using this so for bronzer this
is in the shade dark and this is what it
looks like I really like this I've been
trying it out recently and I think it's
really pretty so nice kind of mid-tone -
she warm bronzer so it's perfect for
contouring and it's perfect for bronzing
I'm just going to put this on my face to
give it some color shape it out a little
bit if you wanted to you could totally
contoured this it looks beautiful as a
contour but for today I'm just using it
as bronzer I mean I'm going to add a
little bit of blush this is ISA for
colorful blush and heated and take my
blush brush and apply a little bit this
has kind of has some shimmer in it so
it's going to give you a little bit of a
glow I mean I'm barely touching my face
and I'm getting quite a bit of color
payoff which is nice another thing I
like to do is just take my bronzer and
put it in the crease so I'm going to
take this bronzer once again and just
fluff this into my crease with a dirty
brush I like to go a little bit above my
crease just to kind of shape out my eye
a little bit more make it look a little
bit bigger so I place it right in that
socket area
honestly just adding a little bit of
bronzer in your crease makes the biggest
difference with your look and then next
step I do like to line my upper lash
line so I'm going to use this NYC smooth
eyeliner this is really really great
this is the city proof 24-hour
waterproof one and the reason I like to
line my upper waterline is because it
makes the lashes look a lot fuller than
if you were to just put mascara on and
have your skin showing putting black up
there will really thicken everything out
and give the illusion that you have more
lashes now I'm not gonna lie to you my
lashes have glue all over them I've been
trying to get my House of lashes glue
off my eyelashes for forever now it's
just not working but I just want to tell
you guys because I wanted you to not
think that this is of a clumpy mascara
because it's not it's my lashes have
glue all over them and I can't get it
off so this is the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara I really like it
it's a good dupe for the benefit roller
lash I never put mascara on my lower
lashes when I'm doing such a light
makeup like this unless I have color on
that lower lash line because it tends to
make my eyes look even more droopy I
already have downturned eyes and I don't
want to make them look even more
downturn and sometimes putting mascara
on that lower lash line really just
brings it down even more so I usually
avoid it unless I have some eyeshadow
smudge underneath here because this way
my eyes are lifted up more it will help
kind of give the illusion that your eyes
are a little bit more lifted and it
brings the eye more focused on these
lashes being pulled up in these having
mascara on them and pulling the look
down do you know what I'm saying so this
is completely optional you don't have to
apply highlighter but I'm just going to
apply this in the inner corner of my
eyes to make it look more awake I'm
using the wet and wild boozy brunch by
the way one of my favorite drugstore
highlighters
and I actually found a link to it I'll
try to link it down below again if it's
still in stock I also didn't take it
underneath my brow just to lift them a
little bit more see it just makes it
just makes all the difference in the
world and then I am gonna add a little
bit to my face since I'm not going to
work or anything I'm just going out
running errands so I am going to take
this tart brush or not tart this is not
tart I'm going to take this target brush
and apply a little bit to the tops of my
cheekbones just to highlight that area
and I'm just gonna leave my nose as is
am I'm gonna highlight it cuz I didn't
contort or anything
astronaut lace is one of my newest
favorite products I have been loving
this lately because it's so comfortable
on the lip I'm obsessed with it it kind
of feels like you have water on your
lips it's just it's amazingly
comfortable so this is the YSL cream I
don't know these are like cream lip
stains and I love it I got this in a PR
package so they customized mine to say
KC which i think is so cute thank you
they smell so good too this is just a
great way to have a light wash of color
sometimes I'll talk liquid lipsticks
with this I will top them with this
because it feels so good on the lips
it's like a cooling sensation and it's
really lightweight you can't feel it
they have a bunch of different colors -
I just like this lighter one okay guys
so that is it for my work slash everyday
makeup tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed
it and enjoy seeing some of these new
products in action and hearing a little
bit more in detail on why I love them so
thank you guys so much for watching give
it a thumbs up if you did like it and I
will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
