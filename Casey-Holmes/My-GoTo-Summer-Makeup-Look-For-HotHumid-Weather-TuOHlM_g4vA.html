all about the makeup that I've been
loving to wear recently since it is
super hot and humid outside I've been
kind of going with this makeup look here
and skipping out on eye shadow eyeliner
you know doing my brows really intense
because I really just don't want to do
it and half the time I am coming in from
the pool and I just want to go out so
I'll just put this makeup book on and be
good to go have some makeup products to
show you guys that have been really
loving lately this is a talked to
tutorial but keep in mind whenever I do
this look Pinot from day to day it will
take me about five to ten minutes not
long at all I want to you know that I do
have rosacea so my main focus where I'm
applying my makeup is just to cover the
rosacea up and then bring the color back
into the face with my bronzer and blush
and things like that but I still want to
stay matte so like I said you guys will
see some of my favorite products in here
I hope you all enjoy this video thank
you guys so much for watching and if you
want to see how I do my everyday makeup
for spring and summer then just keep
watching the video okay so I have
already moisturized my skin I will leave
my skincare products that I use down
below in the description box or if you
guys just want to see an updated morning
routine and nighttime routine I can do
that for you guys so just let me know in
the comments or by liking this video if
you want update routine videos but since
I've already moisturized it is time for
me to prime primer is so important for
me especially in the summer time because
I have super oily skin and if I don't
prime mmm it's just going to be a mess
so right now I have been loving these
primers from bare minerals they're the
prime time line I have the foundation
primer this is the oil control one which
is really nice I have been loving this
lately and then I've been using this one
non-stop if you've been watching my
videos even seeing it the bare minerals
product i'm a beauty primer cream in
medium and this has SPF 30 in it and
then this one has SPF 15 so i'm still
getting the 7 screen protection and i
love these because they're super
lightweight on the skin so the first one
i'm going to apply is the oil control
one just because i want to make sure my
skin stays
nice and matte so this is what it looks
like it comes out kind of like a I would
say like a jelly form I guess you could
say that kind of sounds gross but it's
not bad at all and I'm just going to
apply this to the areas that I get
really oily and gross which is always
right in the t-zone for me and then I
like to apply this BB primer in medium
just because it really helps counteract
a lot of my redness now if my face
starts to get a little bit more tan and
this ever time just from being outside
you know I probably won't use this but
for now I do want to counteract a lot of
the redness that I have in my face and
this has been the perfect product for
that because it's so nice and smooth on
the skin but it doesn't make my skin
super oily or anything like that and it
doesn't dry it out so just like apply
this one all over the face and I could
just notice a huge difference with it I
feel like it really makes my foundation
go on super super smooth okay now time
for face products in the summertime I
really like to focus on my face and not
so much the eyes that I go keep like
simple there which you guys will see
here in a minute but I like to make sure
that my face is good to go I like to
make sure I have good coverage I have
two favorite items I want to show you
guys first off talking about BB creams
I'm obsessed with these Garnier BB
creams for Commodore oily skin I talked
about these last year as well and they
are amazing make sure you get the one
for combo to oily skin because the
normal one will make you look so greasy
I love these the coverage is absolutely
beautiful and I like this better than a
lot of my high-end foundations and
high-end a BB creams that I have so
pieces for the jam if I'm not doing spin
class or whatever
it's just it's really really awesome and
I definitely think you guys should check
this out and this is just better for
like day to day use if I'm running
errands I have to go somewhere really
quick I'll just apply this with like a
flat top kabuki from Sigma and be good
to go and then my other two favorites
are the L'Oreal True Match foundations I
love this foundation I used to hate it
I mentioned it before back in the day I
hate this foundation but I have been
loving it for the past month and a half
I'd say and I probably will not go back
to anything else I've been using this
over - a lotta foundation over all the
Foundation's that I have this is just
with the one I've been going to because
it's affordable and I love the way that
it looks on the skin so today I will be
using the l'oreal true match foundations
i have the colors w5 nw6 today I think
I'm going to be I'm just going to mix
the two today to kind of get my perfect
shade and I really love this foundation
because it's super lightweight and it
doesn't it doesn't feel heavy on the
skin and all i need's just a really
light layer of it okay so my favorite
way to apply this foundation is with the
Beauty Blender but it's just like
favorite way to apply this foundation
just because it goes on super smooth and
it doesn't feel like I kicked on the
foundation so I'm just going to dab this
on my skin and as you can see it covers
up my rosacea really really well it's
not only completely full coverage but it
covers up just enough okay so that is
the foundation done as you can see it
looks really natural and doesn't look
caked up this is something I would wear
if I was going out I like to even wear
this foundation on a day-to-day basis
just because it doesn't feel heavy and I
feel like as the day goes on it looks
even better so by far with my favorites
if you tried that foundation a while
back and hated it I would definitely
recommend trying it again I'm super oily
skin and I do have to you know kind of
touch up throughout the day but I kind
of expect that but it's nothing like
overwhelming and super oily and greasy
and then for concealer I am using my Mac
Pro Longwear you can use a lighter
concealer if you want to as concealer
that is really similar to this one is by
Jane cosmetics and they have an awesome
concealer I can't find mine at the
moment but not to pick it up again
because it's basically Mac Pro Longwear
but from the drugstore so I'm just going
to apply this like I usually do with my
concealer and I promise you I'm not
putting on like a heavy heavy amount it
probably looks like it just because it's
so light
but once I play this and with
Beauty Blender it's again just going to
be super lightweight and since it is
spring and summer time I want to make
sure this makeup stays and I know for a
fact that this concealer will not move
because it's meant to stay and it's
meant to last all day long so that's why
I chose this one and again taking the BT
Blender I'm just going to Pat this into
the skin and then I am going to drag a
little bit of it on my lid just to
counteract any veins redness
discoloration things like that and I
also want to make sure that I put that
concealer right here in the inner part
of my eye just to really brighten it up
because that part of our I can get super
super dark and with the concealer as you
can see I did kind of highlight the face
just because I want to make sure
everything's nice and even and I'm not
highlighted underneath the eyes but not
anywhere else so I like to just put it
right in the center now if I was going
out or something I would use my NARS
concealer on the top of my nose just to
highlight and make it look a little bit
smaller since I would have been
contouring but I'm not going to do a
super strong contour today so I'm going
to get this step and we're just going to
go ahead and move on to powder
translucent powders on my fav'rite
I feel like they look so beautiful on
the skin they don't provide a ton of
coverage but it's nice just to set your
makeup with this if you focus on your
foundation doing most of the coverage
and just set it with this you'll be good
to go sometimes I feel like the powders
I have a lot of coverage will just make
your makeup look a little bit more cakey
especially throughout the day so
translucent is the way for me I just
I've always loved them so I'm going to
step underneath my eyes and I'm also
setting my eyelids just because my
eyelids are really oily and I want to
make sure like that concealer we put on
doesn't crease throughout the day
especially in the heat and then I'm
taking the Real Techniques powder brush
and I will just be setting the rest of
my face makeup with this now if I was
using the same look to go out like I
said earlier I would totally contour
just to define the cheekbones and
everything like that but since it's more
of like kind of a day-to-day look I will
just be using a bronzer and I'm using an
oldie but a goodie which is the Mac
mineralized skinfinish and give me Sun I
used to use this so much last year as
well and the year before because
it's just an awesome browser and I love
the way it looks it is a little bit more
orange so if you're really fair be very
careful with this but if you're more
into the medium to tan skin tone you
would love it so I'm just going to take
this Marc Jacobs what does he call this
the bronze brush I guess and what I like
to put my bronzer is just wherever the
Sun would hit me
so my cheeks on my forehead just a tad
bit on my chin
brush is so soft you guys it was like it
was very expensive um but if you go to
support and feel this brush you'll be
like oh my gosh and applied your bronzer
so nicely
so after that I do like to do blush and
highlighter because I like to make sure
that my I still have some color to my
face and also a little bit of glow
because I like that look during the
spring and summertime so the blush I'm
going to be using today is actually this
new one from Tarte I picked it up a
while back
it's called captivating and this is such
a gorgeous everyday blood it's
definitely a peach blush and it is so
beautiful has a little bit of pink in
there as well and I really like it
because it just looks gorgeous on the
skin especially if you have a nice tan
even if you're a more fair and you
wanted to use this you could use a light
hand with it and it would just give you
a gorgeous peach flush so this is
definitely my Tarte blush that I've used
non-stop I have some other ones from
them but I feel like this is the most
wearable and can go with so many
different looks cause also be used today
with a sigma large angled contour I'm
just going to dust this right on the
cheeks and the apples and then I will
just blend that out with this Mac 187 do
a fiber brush just to make it look more
soft and I also love these blushes
because I don't think that they last 12
hours I'm not going to tell you that but
they do last a really long time on the
skin so there's another reason why I'm
really impressed with these tar blushes
and if you're going to get one I think
you should really pick up captivating
because I don't know if it's going to be
permanent and then for highlighter I'm
going to use this Becca highlighter in
moonstone which is one of my favorites I
love moonstone it's so pretty it's like
a gold champagne shade and I love it
especially with a more bronzed look so
I'm just going to dust this really
quickly on the tops of my cheekbones
just to give a little shine I also take
it a little bit above the brow and keep
its bow and a little bit right on the
nose not too much though and then time
to do brows i can't skip brows but i
don't want to fill them in completely
and have them super defined and shaped
so the product that i
using lately is this benefit gimme brow
and I didn't really use this a lot I
mean I used it to set my brows sometimes
but I haven't really put it to use till
now and I love this for the spring and
summertime because it holds your brows
in place because still add some color
and actually kind of fill them and for
you it's not as defined as I want them
to be but that's kind of the point of
this look right you don't have to have
defined brows super winged eyeliner I'm
just going to be using this give me brow
and the cool thing about this it has
like fibers in it so it attaches to the
hairs and makes them look fuller and
that's how it fills them in really
nicely I'm using the shade medium deep
and I'm just going to brush this over my
brows and just shape them in place so
you can see the difference between this
route in this brow it makes a really big
difference it still kind of shapes your
brows but it's not like too much at all
so it adjusts a thing on the other side
I just love how it like fills everything
and it looks so good okay so that is the
brows done they're not perfect but
they're a little bit more filled in and
they just look a little bit better so
brows are done now we are going to line
our upper waterline I'm using my NARS
via veneto eyeliner because I know this
stays all day and will not smudge on me
so I'm just going to line the upper
waterline
and I'm not going to line the bottom
waterline just because I want my eyes to
really stay open and nice and awake and
my favorite mascara has been the L'Oreal
voluminous Miss Magnum Miss Magnum
I don't know this is such an awesome
mascara you guys this is basically a
dupe for the Too Faced better than sex
mascara it is so good
and you guys want me to do a comparison
between this and the better the sex let
me know in the comments below or
something so I'm going to take this
Tarte eyelash curler I'm just going to
curl my lashes and I'm just going to
apply this mascara all over and at first
I thought I wouldn't like this little
bendy thing but it's actually not bad
like look at that this eye on the side
it's freaking awesome okay so that
lashes are done now I'm going to do is
I'm going to apply a lip gloss now if
I'm just doing day to day I don't want
to do full-on lip liner lipstick lip
gloss I would might try to have a lip
gloss to go to to just throw on and then
I notice when we really pigmented and
last for a while you guys know I
absolutely love these whitening
lightening losses my absolute favorite
thing ever is the nude lip gloss from
White Lightning this is just my baby I
love it it's just so good I know a ton
of people are like oh whining laughing
again but seriously I don't mention them
just for the hell of it I mention them
because they're awesome so the one I'm
going to be using today is coral craze
which is a beautiful coral shade and
it's obviously the perfect color for
summer and it goes along with this blush
really nicely so I'm just going to apply
this oh hold on okay if you get the
gloss that has like this foggy thing on
the mirror just take it off the mirror
is not messed up you just have to rip it
off I made that mistake before
look at how pigmented that is ah so the
nude and the coral crates are by for my
favorites I did with kit Bunco if you
guys want to check them out by these are
awesome
they're not sticky and they sit on your
lips really really nicely now when I'm
not talking through the video this only
takes me about five to ten minutes
honestly doesn't take me long at all I
always focus on my face first and then I
just put mascara on and I'm good to go
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
please give it a thumbs up if you did

summer makeup island is down below in
