on my favorite products which is
basically I'm gonna call it my holy
grail product video very excited to do
it I haven't done one of these I've been
meaning to ever since I first started my
channel and I just have it which I'm
kind of glad that I waited because I've
found many different products I'm
seriously in love with and will
definitely like repurchase a million
bajillion gazillion time but first
before I even start I just want to go
ahead and show you guys if you follow me
on Twitter or Instagram you know that I
got the Coastal Scents warm palette and
it actually came in today and I'm
excited about it if you want me to do a
tutorial or something on this let me
know it is the warm palette and I really
like these colors are more wearable for
me than any of the other ones so this is
just an overview I'm excited to try this
out like I said just got it today so if
you want to see a review or a tutorial
not just let me know another thing I dig
it my Henry highlight it it's gonna be
super bright for a couple videos and
then it's gonna die down so don't freak
on me yet okay
are kind of newer products sometimes I
you know just recently got maybe got a
while back like the NARS stuff I've had
and then some of the stuffs been recent
but I really love them and I would buy
them a thousand times if I could which
is why I'm showing you so let's start
with skincare now this is the only thing
I have for like Holy Grail other than my
makeup wipes which is that all may
makeup remover wipes oh you don't have
anything to just run out but um this has
saved my skin I literally just got it a
few days ago but holy cow it has saved
my skin it really has cleared up like
that so it is dig clear pour oil
eliminating ash drink it effectively
treats and helps prevent breakouts
without over-drying
has salicylic acid acne medication and
it's from Neutrogena I love this stuff I
did get the CVS brand like cotton rounds
these are like the 80 rounds or whatever
but this I use it twice a day and then a
fluid ounces I do believe it's about
five or six dollars don't quote me but
I'm pretty sure it's around there hum
but I've been using this so much because
if you've been watching me you know I've
been kind of breaking out and sort of
like freaking out over it this has
seriously like cleared up my skin I mean
everything just go back to normal and
I'm so happy thank you
it does not dry me out I'm really oily
and it actually does help control the
oil so Holy Grail
love it next thing is foundation and you
know I've been using number seven I do
love it but I have to admit my holy holy
grail I will forever solve I swear by is
Dean arch to your Mac foundation
especially if you have really oily skin
this is for you I love it it controls
the oil it just looks amazing on your
skin
totally totally recommend it the next
thing is from NARS um and it's a powder
and it's my NARS powder in mountain now
you can tell I've used the crap out of
this and this was my second little
little container of it I have to go get
a new one because I am scraping the pan
but I really love this stuff I've been
swearing by since I started my youtube I
love gnar
products like NARS face products are my
favorite I will go and splurge on them
because I feel like they really work for
my skin they don't break me out they're
great for the oiliness you know that I
got going on I love this forever will
swear by this powder I have to go get a
new one I don't have a support near me
and I really wanted when I go to buy the
powder I want to buy a new foundation
and a new concealer stuff like that by
them so trying to wait so I can go to a
support to buy a new one it's really
killing me but I love this stuff it's
amazing extra bronzers the first one is
also by NARS and this is NARS Casino and
it's just a really nice dark brown
bronzer this does have like little
shimmers in it like little gold shimmers
but they're nothing you know too
extravagant this is a really nice
bronzer that they use like on my chest
and my neck sometimes I'll contour that
sometimes I don't but a really great
bronzer the next one is also a bronzer
this is one that Lauren gave me by
myself using this more to contour like a
contour more like using this and I do my
NARS one and because I feel like it's
just great for my face and it's not too
light like I thought it was gonna be and
it's just the hoola bronzer and you know
these come in a little box and that's
what it looks like and I love this when
I used to see it on people's videos I
was like wow that was this way too dark
for me I mean to like um because I'm
really dark and all this other stuff I
tried this on and this sucker is bad
like I love it
it just it just creates a natural
contour like shade to my face I love it
and I will go by the full sinus when I'm
done with this so thank you Lauren the
next thing is just like a no-go like it
has to happen for blushes like I have to
mention it and it's the Mac dolly mix I
will forever use this I really love it I
think it just gives a pretty change my
face whether I'm lighter darker whatever
this is the best blush I've ever tried
and I really love it it's just so
freakin pretty next eggs by Mac as well
and this is my little eye pencil and
it's just in smolder just a regular
black crown liner this thing is really
great love this as well going on to
liquid liners is the NYC liquid liner
amazing I do
my Kat Von D one which I was trying to
find for you guys I couldn't find it but
I didn't want to show it to you because
you can't buy it anymore
I haven't seen it like just the plain
black one so I didn't want to mention
that so I decided to mention the NYC
liquid liner which is amazing
I kind of gotta get used to it because
the handle is so long but um amazing and
I love it lasts all day next are my
scare is you see me rave about them the
first one is the covergirl lash
perfection and the wand just looks like
this I love this mascara it's more of a
dry mascara so it really like catches
the lashes and lengthens them the next
one is one by one from Maybelline and
this is what that bristle looks like and
it's a thicker rubberized they're still
really great at lengthening separating
just all of it love it and then this one
I can't get enough of it's the Estee
Lauder sumptuous extreme and that's the
bristles if you've been watching me
you've seen these probably a thousand
zillion times but I have to mention it
just because I love them this is another
one you see cv completely love and it's
um the Mac carbon I feel like out of all
the eyeshadows matte cast this is the
one if I just didn't want to buy like
hiren eyeshadows anymore and I had only
pick one it would totally be Carmen and
it's just your basic black but seriously
I don't know what it is about it it's
just the most amazing black easy to
blend super easy to apply it looks great
I love it I love it more than Urban
Decay's blackout you know it's just
better to me so I love next is a
concealer my Mac select cover-up
concealer this covers up so nicely under
my eyes I love it all forever use it and
I will literally because a little bit of
this stuff goes a long way and you have
so much product in this bottle so I
think it's worth the money honestly okay
the next two are for my hair now the
first thing is something I recently
discovered and if you know I do or I did
wash my hair every single day which is
so bad especially with
blonde hair you know it breaks off stuff
like that whatever so I went and got a
new dry shampoo that a Twitter follower
recommended me and it's the bio Tara dry
shampoo it says it has up to 60
applications don't know about all that
but it's really great this is just what
it looks like and it has a little
applicator and a nice little top I'm
gonna go buy another one of these just
to keep in my purse
because I'm in love with it I'm running
on second day hair right now still gotta
get used to the feel of second day hair
I don't know it's just I feel gross I
don't know this has definitely been
amazing I just put it you know on my
roots rub it in with my fingers wherever
it looks oily whatever and then I just
brush it out with a brush and it just
looks amazing one thing I have to say
about this is it is a white powder and
when I had my dark roots coming in when
I put it on there you could see the
white powder so I don't recommend this
for brunettes because you will look like
you're getting gray hair but I recommend
it for the ones out there I've been
really into volumizing powders it's just
been one of the things that I'm going on
a hunt for now and I'm trying to find
the perfect one and I found quite a bit
of really good ones and the first one is
the got to be powerful which I did do a
review on love this stuff it's just
amazing like there's nothing wrong with
it I love it and then since the one
Lauren sent me and I actually have it in
my hair right now it's really really
great
and it's the rock your hair bombshell
big hair powder I love the smell of this
one more than I do that got to be one
and the packaging is like super pewter
but I love it I just I'm in love with
volumizing powders and these two have
been my top two I keep this one in my
purse just in case I need a little
volume going on whenever I'm out about
but yeah those were my basically Holy
Grail products I recommend them to every
single one of you especially for the
oily skin girls I recommend all this
stuff too because it's just amazing so I
hope you guys enjoyed it if you want me
to do a review on this coast
since warm palette please just let me
know I will totally be happy to it's my
first one so I'm excited to try this and
I hope you guys enjoyed this video don't
forget to subscribe and I will see you
on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
