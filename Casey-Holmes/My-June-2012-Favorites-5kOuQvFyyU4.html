my June favorites um I'm sorry if I'm
not in the most like amazing mood I've
had the roughest day anything that can
go wrong has gone wrong if you follow me
on Twitter and Facebook and all that you
know that I went I got mine iPhone this
is actually the second one and I just
got it today so I've been dealing with
this I filmed this video and then I went
to play it back and it said untitled
image so I'm having a refill man again
and I'm just like I'm ready to go to
sleep I'm ready to go to sleep not to
mention I also have a hair appointment
at 2:00 which is in less than 30 minutes
so I'm gonna try to get through this
video very quickly so I can get up for
you guys a week is just way too long to
go without filming so I'm gonna go hang
out to the favorites my first favorites
are my shampoo and conditioner I love
the Dove nutritive therapy nourishing
oil care I've been using these for about
two months now and I really love them
these are definitely my favorite ones
right now I just I love this line this
is definitely I repurchase these twice
so I really really like them okay next
is eyeshadows and the first two are from
forever 21 if you saw my haul you saw me
mention these and the first one is this
beige color I like to use this one more
like all over my lid and little beige my
crease very pigmented and they wear very
well and then I use dark brown olive
just in my crease kind of do deepen it
up a little bit so it's a very easy
everyday look and I really like those
two eyeshadows and the last eyeshadow
thing is this Victoria's Secret palette
I love this first off the packaging is
so cute I don't know if you can see it
but has sort of a snakeskin texture but
this is called the summer seduction eye
kit and this is what looks like I've
been using these three so much this
matte Brown and then the highlight
shades oh I'm just so in love with them
I need to experiment with the color once
too but I have been using those like
crazy I have them on my eyes today and
if you've been watching like my past
videos that's what I've had on my eyes
as well so I've been loving this
reaching for it so much and
I also got this palette at this in my
annual sale I think this is like this
shimmer spring one I don't know but I
got that one too if you're wondering I
know I never did a like little haul with
it um okay next is mascara
I did a mascara likes and dislikes video
in the beginning of the month and I had
a ton of you recommend some awesome
mascaras that I can't wait to try but
this is the first one I went and picked
up and it's the lash blast volume like
as if I need any mascaras right and I
know some of your probably like another
favorite mascara but seriously this
stuff is amazing I don't even use
another mascara with it this is the only
thing I have on my lashes and it like
it's the only thing I wear on my lashes
so this is what the wand looks like I
just I'm in love with this mascara it
does everything that I combined other
mascaras to do so I really like this is
definitely my favorite thank you to all
of you who recommended it to me I'm in
love just love it okay next is blushes
the first one is what involves
pearlescent pink this is definitely just
my favorite blush of the moment right
now this one and the other one I'm about
to show you they're just so summery and
like look really good with the tan which
I know I'm not very tan right now I've
kind of gotten back to my like real skin
tone which I have not seen them for ever
which sounds crazy but I use a lot of
self tan or - so I've been self-tanning
so I still have that kind of summer
bronze look but I'm not like overly tan
like I used to be which I do like it a
lot better I have to say so I like it
but the next blush is the Milani
mineralized blush isn't very more you
saw this in my how i contour video
definitely just one of the prettiest
blushes that I own these next two you
also saw in my how I contour video this
is the mary lou lou manizer which is
just a like just a really nice highlight
and then this hoola benefit bronzer
which is great for contouring is just
your perfect matte bronzer i wish it was
a little bit darker but you know what it
works so i like it and then the two
concealers I've been using of course I'm
gonna mention this I'm not gonna go into
like full depth about it but it's the
Revlon age defying concealer
you guys know I love this for underneath
my eyes I just think it's amazing so I
really like it and then the time bomb
the bomb concealer and medium as well
this is probably my all-time favorite
face concealer it covers love like
nobody's business I did use this
underneath my eyes but it really settled
into the fine lines that I had so I
didn't like it that much underneath my
eyes but all my face this is just the
best concealer I have used so I really
like it and if you're wondering I got
these two on um hope look or outlook
whatever you guys want to call it I know
I get a bunch of Corrections on it but
um I got it on there and usually if you
follow me on Twitter or Facebook stuff
like that you know when the sales are
going on because usually I have the
emails that go to my phone
I always check them every day all the
time so I always let you guys know when
there's so I always let you guys know
whenever um there's some good sales
going on like I just ordered this model
in a bottle and like a crown brush so
just follow me on there if you're kind
of like not an email person and you just
kind of want to know when the good
stuffs coming up so um and then I got
the l'oreal color riche bomb that i love
so much this is definitely my favorite
like chapstick it's a pink satin and it
doesn't have like a lot of color payoff
but it is a really really light pink
it's just so moisturizing and it smells
so good so i really really really really
recommend this if you're in the market
for like a new kind of like lip balm so
the last makeup related items is my
Sedona lace 12-piece essential kit
they're all dirty I just put them in
here just so I could show you guys what
they look like I've been using these
every single day they are definitely my
favorite brushes at the moment I've been
using pretty much nothing but Sedona
lace brushes for the past two months so
I really like this a lot I really
recommend it to you I know I mentioned
it in my haul this is probably the best
like starter kit for brushes like if
you're just starting out with makeup
I really recommend these I think they're
super super great so definitely go check
out so Donal lace and I have just a few
more products
I have this which is the beyond the
Beauty curling iron I've been curling my
hair like crazy this month um and this
is a curling iron I've been going to
just get super hot really quickly it
doesn't like fry my hair so I've been
really loving this then my last hair
favorite is this big sexy hair powder
play best volumizing powder I have to
say I really really love this I love it
more than the got to be one and I kind
of like it a little bit more than my
mindful Oracle and I always talk about
but this is kind of expensive I think
like sixteen dollars but is so so good I
really recommend it if you're a
volumizing powder person this is
definitely the one that I think you
should try out as well it is so so good
I can't stress it enough then these are
my last two favorites it has to be nail
polish and if you have kind of been
following me around this month you know
that these are my favorite nail polishes
of the month right now I have bikini so
teeny on my nails and this is actually
the first time that I've used an Essie
nail polish on all of my nails because
usually I don't like sp
I feel like it shifts really easily and
they don't last long but so far these
kind of been going you know pretty well
and then this has definitely been a
favorite of the month
it's the Julie G nail polish and bikini
it's just the most gorgeous color ever a
lot of people ask where I get my Julie
to nail Pasha's I actually get them from
Rite Aid but I know she has a site and
now put the link down below where you
can go and check out her site as well
where you can order her nail polishes
and stuff like that so I hope you guys
enjoyed this I have to go and get my
hair done I still have to edit and
