an unboxing I actually just got my
Outlook order in and it also got my
little black bag in the mail so I wanted
to do an unboxing and show you guys what
I got so I'm gonna start with outlook
and I did order from the bomb when they
wrong outlook a few weeks ago and only
got three things so you pretty much get
like your little thing telling you what
you got and then you have your products
right here so basically if you don't
know what Olek is it's you know designer
stuff that goes on sale and you have a
certain amount of time to buy those
products and they do wrap it up and put
a little sticker and I'm surprised that
they packaged this really well cuz
sometimes they don't package their stuff
that well but I'm really happy with
these so the first thing I'm going to
show you is this little nail polish and
I've never tried the bomb polishes and
this is in sky-blue
right past you it is such a pretty blue
I was like oh I have to get that and I'm
excited to try it out it's actually
bigger than I thought it would be and it
kind of no it's different but it's
really cute I like I'm excited to try
that out the next thing I got was this
time bomb the bomb concealer this is
like a cute little box packaged the
other thing I don't remember how much
this stuff was by the way so the little
concealer just looks like this it
literally is little see if I can open it
oh there's like a little part where you
serve them whatever and it just comes
with like this little thing on top don't
know if I'm supposed to keep that in
there
super creamy oh god it's very very dark
I don't know but that's what it looks
like I think I got mine in medium don't
know it is dark really dark then the
last thing I got I was so excited about
I hear Wendy talk about this all the
time which is Bentley blonde and it's
the mary lou the mary lou manizer AKA
lou manizer whatever this is what looks
like so cute they have like the cutest
little packaging ever and I got the
little highlight one all the packaging
so cute she's on there
I like little stuff they put on there so
funny but this is what looks like just a
nice highlight I've heard awesome
awesome things about this highlight and
I've been looking for a new one so
that's it right there
super pretty kind of like a champagne e
color and it's really soft it has a
little mirror how cute is that packaging
so I'm excited to try this out and see
what I think of it so that's why I got
from Outlook just three little things
and then my favorite little light bag
came in the mail so in love with this
subscription site I'm just like oh I
love them so much they're so sweet by
the way they did give me a cute I'm not
getting paid with any of the coupons I
gave me they were just super nice and
decided that you guys have a coupon for
your first little back bag so yeah it
has to be your first one you've ever
bought I will keep that down below I
think it expires like the 25th of June
or something like that so we'll leave
that down below for you guys so again
this one is smaller because I didn't get
really anything big so this is this top
I have been so excited for this and then
down here you have like your package
slip and all that stuff don't care
I'm interested in this baby so this is
what looks like so cute how they package
their stuff I'm just in love with this
website and love all right let's see I
actually looked this up and this was
retail for 53 dollars and if you don't
know this site you're a little black bag
I'm gonna link the full first video
right here cuz I really talk about and
stuff but pretty much it's 50 with tax
like 50 to 53 dollars a month or 54 I
think mine's 54 four dollars a month and
you get picked three designer stuff so I
think that's awesome and I did look this
up before I bought it
and it retailed for $53 so I already
paid for the bag with this and I can't
get it open
they're excited sook oh I love it oh my
god so cute so this is the wallet and
it's from the back the brand deluxe
deluxe I guess you could call it don't
know it is so cute I want a black one
cuz I wanted to go with everything so I
have like this little bow and like gold
detailing and oh my god it's so cute
I'm so excited Oh in it I didn't even
get to see the inside you guys and
seriously is a adorable so you get like
this little thing in here oh my god it's
so big so this is what the inside looks
like I haven't seen it at all I tried to
look up things on it I couldn't find it
you get like a cool little pocket right
there you get the logo little zipper and
you get a ton of card spots which I
really really need sided to switch my
wallets out then I got some jewelry that
is like really sticky in the packaging I
don't understand
okay so I did get two things and I
really wanted both of these now this
time I really um you know traded and
stuff like that I really wanted to
experience trades and everything and I
when I was going to check out there was
two things I wanted I wanted that wallet
so I was keeping that and then I saw
that I had this in my bag and I kept it
it's a Robert Rose necklace and this
retails for like 40 something dollars it
is gorgeous look at this necklace so so
gorgeous I'm just in love with this like
I said it is from Robert rose and it's
just like a chain necklace Oh doesn't
look cute with this shirt but it's just
like spices up any outfit it's so like
high-quality and really nice so I
absolutely love this I was like I am
gonna keep that because it is adorable
so I had another item in my bag that I
really didn't want and I really wanted
this necklace I haven't won this since
my last little black bag I didn't really
trade last time so I didn't really
kind of try to get it but I got it this
time I think it's so adorable and it's
from the brand dad please suck this
thing ah it is so cute let's see if it
gets right there we go so it's a really
short necklace which I actually like I
like shorter necklaces but this is what
the design looks like kind of like that
chevron print oh my gosh is so pretty I
just thought this would be cute just to
spice up like a little tank top or
whatever
I love how short it is I didn't think
it's gonna be this short but it really
is shorter and I absolutely love it it's
kind of like a choker kind of thing and
I think it's gonna be so so cute so that
is all that I got from Outlook and my
little black bag if you're interested
