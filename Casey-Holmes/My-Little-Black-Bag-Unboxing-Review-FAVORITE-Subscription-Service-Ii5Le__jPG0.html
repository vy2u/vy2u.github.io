unboxing and a review I just ordered
from this site literally a week ago and
I got it in today and I'm so excited
I've been waiting for it and still
excellence video is on as you can tell
by the title of course but it's on
little black bag calm and it's a
different subscription site now it is
$54 which is the most expensive one I've
seen so far I know glossy box is like
20-something and then you have the $10
ones that are crap I know a lot of
people are probably thinking oh my god
$54 is such a lot like a such a huge
amount to be spending on a subscription
site but if you think about if you're
one of those girls that go shopping and
buys a new purse like every week or
every month you're getting three things
for fifty dollars which is probably less
than what you spent on that one purse or
that one shopping trip so and it's
really great designer stuff and I just
absolutely am in love with it and
usually I'm not for like super high
subscription sites like when I first
heard this is like fifty something
dollars is like oh no this one is so
awesome I just love it so much I'm gonna
go ahead and show you guys what's in the
box and I'm gonna tell you more about
the subscription service I got off work
came home and I'm like looking at a hot
mess but I know the UPS man because he
delivers stuff to my work and I'm so
surprised he ships to my house but um he
showed me this is like dang somebody big
up your box and they did like look at
how effed up my boxes I am so excited
I'm trying to contain my excitement
actually okay so alright yeah they
really did beat it up okay so this is
what it looks like on the inside
so I have this I know the one thing I
got because I picked it out and then you
have another little thing and the
package slip
and I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys
what God so of course that makes a
little black bag logo which ones this
one this is the necklace oh I'm sorry
about this one okay I crazy oh this is
both of them okay
I got a necklace and a pair of earrings
too
I actually swapped this necklace I had
like um some like chain necklace that
went down and I really didn't like it I
would never wear it so I picked this one
up and I liked it I think this will
definitely spice up like a black shirt
oh I like it so this is what it looks
like it's a very like huge statement
piece like I absolutely love it and it's
by Robert Rose doesn't have like the tag
of how much it was but I love it I love
it oh it's so cute
I really cannot wait to wear this black
shirt like over the weekend or just like
even casual so I absolutely love this I
can't remember the original price of it
but I know it was expensive and this is
like really great quality stuff like
these cords are really thick and this is
just really really nice so there's a
close-up of it these pair of earrings I
wasn't like oh my god I have to have but
at this point at the time nobody really
wanted to trade me but I was like you
know what I can work with these so
they're from someone called dad and
they're like the little spiked turquoise
earrings so this is what I picked out
and I'm so excited this is actually sold
out on the site they have it in brown
still sorry they're having a brown still
but not this color
okay so it has a cloth bag which I love
and it's from the brand Neela Anthony it
is so cute oh my god I saw this bag and
I was like half to have that this is
what it looks like is it not the cutest
thing ever okay so I love tassels and
stuff like that I don't know if I am
what's in my makeup bag will be up
before this but my makeup bag also has
tassels on it and this has little
tassels here some buckle detailing and
of course a pocket there which I like
that Charlie protective that's cool then
you have of course oh wait that's just a
tag just kidding but then you also have
the same thing and this was actually
originally $80 and then you have the
other pocket over here and you also have
a back pocket I just love this color and
I've been really wanting a big bag for
summer because I've been carrying a lot
more stuff and my poor little DKNY went
over there it's not holding all the
stuff I need to hold but they've had it
for a really long time like a few months
now let's do so this also kind of opens
up I don't think it's really meant for
anything I mean if you want to be like
tampons can go in there that'd be cool
like you little tampons can go in there
and you can just dip it up but that just
flaps over this is why I loved I loved
it pulls yours I have to have a zip
closure so just open that up and it has
a strap so you can wear to the side I
don't know if I'll wear about definitely
be keeping those in here and this is the
pattern so cute and then you have this
zip pocket right here and of course the
Neila
what is the Anthony her that's her logo
so oh my god and they have pockets here
of course for your cell phone and all
that stuff but I am just so in love with
this deck it is not the cutest and like
if I go shopping I could tell you put
the shots on and then you know go about
my day it's really great quality so yeah
that's what I got in my little black bag
I am so happy with it i honest-to-god
was thinking about getting two
subscriptions because I kind of really I
kind of like I kind of got over obsessed
and I was like I want more because they
have like BCBG on them a bunch of like
you know different jewelry they have
cosmetics home decor just stuff like
that and it's just a really great
website now I'm gonna kind of tell you
how it is you take a style quiz and then
by like how your quiz is like what you
are or whatever however that works they
pick out certain items for you then you
could still go on the site and look at
it and if there's something that you
like you could pick that one thing now
that one thing is you're guaranteed item
in your bag so you automatically have
that now the other two items because you
get three items in this little black bag
the other two items are what the stylist
will pick out for you
now if you don't like what the stylist
picked out for you like the other
stylist picked up some really crazy of
your necklace and I picked I traded it
for this one I didn't like the necklace
you picked for me then another stylist
pick this from you and of course I kept
them but you have the option to trade
there's so many people on this side
willing to trade with you and it's just
like that too you don't want to trade
you totally don't have to but it's just
fun I don't know it's just fun to trade
and you know it's like you get to
interact with other girl but I
absolutely love this site all the stuff
is such amazing quality like I am so
thrilled and if you know the time comes
between the 1st and the 5th where you
see something you don't like and you
don't want to spend your money you could
totally skip a month like you don't have
to buy the bag every month now they do
have an option where you can pick your
you can buy their first bag for $77 and
it's not so screwed it's a subscription
but keep in mind just go ahead and do
the $54 one for the subscription service
and if you want to you can cancel at any
time you can skip a month so I wouldn't
spend the $74 on just one box so like I
said shipping did take a week and I'm so
that's from when I clicked like send my
bag like that's right when I had clicks
in my bag um so yeah if you have any
more questions about this stuff I know I
kind of rambled a little bit
just let me know in the comments below I
will also leave the link to their site
in the bottom bar I hope you all enjoyed
this video let me know if you go check
it out and what you get they get new
stuff all the time so yeah I hope you
guys enjoy this video I cannot wait to
order my next a little bike back and I
will see well I mean excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
