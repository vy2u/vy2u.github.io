update and makeup collection this is
just pretty much the same storage and
everything but kind of switched some
things around and I've gotten a few more
things it's the last makeup collection
that I did so if you are interested in
seeing my updated and makeup collection
then just keep watching so I'm just
going to quickly just tell you a little
overview of this vanity I've shown it
before but I got this black vanity from
Bethany on um it was $150 and I got it
probably about in January or a little
bit before then I can't exactly remember
but I know they had this one and one in
white and the only thing I feel like I
have to try and be careful of more is so
cuz it's so black everything shows up so
try to keep towels down or anything like
that but this actually opens up as a
mirror which you've probably seen that
in the past in my last makeup video or
makeup collection video but I put it
down and I liked it better this way by
the way a lot of you keep saying in the
background it's really plain I'll be
putting a big mirror right here and I'll
be filling up this wall with something
that I find soon I'm sure so those walls
will be filled up very soon to make you
guys happy but yeah this is the overview
I do have a pink little trash can and a
light underneath there that came on my
lights that I talked about my last video
so if you're interested I'll post my
last video in the downbar then I just
have like my camera box and my so my
Sedona lace brush roll so and by the way
these this is still makeup - and the
nail polish on we'll be talking about
but I keep my nail polish right there
also this mirror is from Ulta I got it
on Ulta calm this drawer is basically
like my eye bin so but I keep like my
moisturizer from Cetaphil up here the
one my derm prescribed to me my BB cream
and also my hydroxy tone 90 second
record Acer I also have my eyelash
curlers up here so in this first drawer
by the way I got these pink drawers from
Walmart a while back I did see black
ones the other month whenever school
supplies were coming out so that's where
I get all this stuff the first store has
Maybelline tattoos I have regular ones
runs from the permanent collection and
ones from
the Fall collection that just came out
so I have those up there this short is
basically the one that I go to the most
if I'm not using my naked palette so I
had my favorite quad of the moment this
is the Maybelline eye studio and cozy
cashmere and then I just have like a Kat
Von D pallet some matte shadows rocker

the top down here I just have extra
random stuff it just ranges from high in
