a different room because my stepdad is
mowing in the backyard which where my
room is you can hear it so crazy so I
kind of like this lighting better so I'm
debating whether I want to film in here
more so I'm gonna get all my favorites
for the month of March D bio Terra dry
shampoo and the rock your hair bombshell
big hair powder which just looks like
this
I really love it the bio Terra one is
ten dollars and I'm not sure about the
big hair powder one but I know you can
get it at t.j.maxx next are their two
powders I've been using a ton lately and
it's the elf pressed powder and this
isn't caramel just looks like that
basics you know powder and then the next
one is this lorac transparent powder and
I'm pretty sure this is a medium so
those are two I've been using a ton next
are lip products and these are what I've
been using a lot I think the one by
itself that I just I love to use this by
itself like I don't need a lip gloss
over it it's Hugh by Mac this is just
what it looks like
that's a swatch of it right there it is
so pretty it's just most amazing baby
could pink lipstick ever and it doesn't
need anything with it so it just looks
amazing myself and I've been using a
perfect day as well which I have showed
this I do believe in another favourites
video this one's definitely more
pigmented than Hugh and that's it right
there it's a very pretty color and the
lip gloss I never wear lip glosses but
if I wear a lip gloss this is you want
to use and it's called the beaut root I
guess every 21 like two Christmases ago
or something and if I do use the lip
glosses is what I use because it's not
sticky it is super opaque it doesn't
have a name by the way so I am sorry
trust me I searched the bottle up and
down for a name for you guys and there's
definitely just not names so just go
check out your 3 21s and see if they
have like a light nice light pink poorly
color and this is what it looks like it
is just so pretty like it's it looks so
amazing over a perfect day and it
doesn't
like make the lipstick look kind of
caked up or anything like that it just
looks really pretty
next is one more lip product and it's my
ELF conditioning lip balm this is a nice
and natural it's kind of getting towards
the summertime so I love to use this on
my lips has SPF of 15 in it and it has a
really great color payoff so I love this
and plus it just smells like summer like
it smells like the coconut oil you put
on your body whenever you're tanning the
next three things are what I use under
my eyes and they will be having an
under-eye tutorial soon of what I use of
course I just use my Mac concealer I use
to stay don't stray the prime underneath
my eyes and I use hiding and in that
tutorial I will show you guys how I use
these products together so just keep
your eyes out for it should be up not
long after this one probably next or
something I don't know then I love this
hoola benefit bronzer I've been really
digging benefit products now ever since
I got the benefit products in my swab so
I just really love these products
they're really great and I think they're
awesome this thing is this elf
waterproof eyeliner pen I really loved
he put as like in my person like if I
needed touch at my iron or when I'm out
I totally can it is a felt tip but it
has a really amazing color payoff in
that crazy but it stays on very well so
I love that just to kind of toss in my
person go next is another thing from
help and it's the of complete coverage
concealer this is another product that I
just love to throw my person go what I
love is that it has four different
shades so if I need a touch-up a blemish
I can do that with this if I need a
touch-up you know underneath my eyes to
brighten it I can go with this okay next
is just kind of body stuff the first one
is this Victoria's Secret perfecting
glow body shimmer it's a instant glow
but this is what it looks like I love
kind of like body shimmers during the
summer time they're just really great
this one I saw it was tinted and I was
like I wonder I have to have it gives
you a nice kind of glow to your skin and
it looks really great with it hands so
I've been loving this and I think was
only like $12 so next thing is from
Victoria's Secret
again
and this is the Victoria's Secret Angel
perfume I've had this for a while I just
don't know I didn't really use it as
much I couldn't find my summer bombshell
perfume so I sprayed this and I was like
why did I ever stop using it so I've
been reusing it again I love it and it's
just like the cutest bottle ever so and
the last thing is this JWoww lush and
I've been using this like crazy I had to
like this is one of them but I have two
of these little travel-size bottles of
Estee Lauder stuff like this little a
sailor bottle and I filled them both up
with this lotion I have one of these
bottles at work I keep this one in my
purse and then of course they keep the
bottle at home so I've been loving this
it leaves like a really pretty gorgeous
Sheen to your skin it really moisturizes
very well and it has like little
shimmers in it like gold shimmer so it
looks really pretty with a tan so that
was my March favorites I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and let me know if
you like this kind of setting better I
don't know if you can see the back
because when I'm looking at you see like
black I don't know so let me know what
you think and I will see you on the next
