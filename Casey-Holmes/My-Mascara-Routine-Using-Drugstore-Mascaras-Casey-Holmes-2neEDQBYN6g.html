my mascara team this is just what I do
not really on a daily basis but I do it
a lot maybe they don't not this past
month and I've been obsessed with it I'm
using three drugstore mascaras I'll tell
you the kind of difference between them
in the video but if you don't like long
dramatic looking lashes and you probably
won't like this video but if you love to
be on the more dramatic side of things I
think you will really like this tutorial
and it'll kind of give you some ideas
for a new mascara to try out step don't
forget to like it in the end and
subscribe I will see you guys in my next
video bye so the first thing I'm going
to do is curl my lashes with this Revlon
lash curler you can use any one that you
prefer and I'm just going to curl them
and pump the thing a few times then I'm
taking this covergirl LashBlast Volume
Mascara and I'm going to apply this all
over my lashes I love this one because
it really helps my lashes hold a curl
usually throughout the day my lashes
will start to get kind of like droopy
and stuff like that but with this
mascara it literally makes them stay
curled and up all day long I love it
then I'm taking the l'oreal collagen
infused mascara this one has a really
long name just keep in mind it's the
walnut the all black tube and this one's
amazing for volume and making your
lashes really black if you were to use
this on its own and build it up by
itself you could get really clumpy
lashes but with this mascara routine you
won't have that problem but this is
amazing to put in here because it really
makes your lashes super black and very
very volumize then I'm taking this
covergirl lash perfection this is one of
my favorite mascaras I've ever used and
this one's amazing at separating your
lashes and really lengthening them the
wand is so little that it really helps
get to the root of your lashes and
really helps lift them and make them
super long so I absolutely love this
mascara I'm also going to use that same
one on my bottom lashes because it's
really easy with the small wand so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know if you've tried any of these
mascaras and how you like them
I will see you all in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
