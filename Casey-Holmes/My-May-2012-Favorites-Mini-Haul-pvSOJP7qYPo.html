favorites I have a bunch of new stuff to
show you guys and I also have a mini
haul that I want to do so I'm gonna kind
of get through the my favorites and if
what I show right here has been in
videos which it has like I have a review
or something on it I will link it right
here for you guys so I'm gonna go ahead
and get started the first thing are my
Sedona lace brushes I've shown these a
lot in my videos haven't done a complete
review yet but review will be coming
soon but I absolutely love each and
every one of these brushes I use every
single one like eye contour more now
it's just I don't know when you have the
right brushes everything's easier and
you just enjoy a little bit more I feel
like so been really loving those brushes
the next thing is what you saw in my
everyday face routine which i will link
right here haven't seen it it's just
this Revlon age defying concealer I
really really love this stuff I have
mine and medium and it's just one of the
best concealers I've ever had I actually
have my everyday face routine on today
and I absolutely love it next is a
lipstick I am just so in love with this
lipstick I have it on right now
one of my favorites I've ever ever had
and it's the Mac what is this innocence
beware I forgot for a second I'm gonna
be so sad because this is not in the
permanent collection but I've been using
it like crazy it's just my favorite and
I really don't want it to go away
so yeah I really love this lipstick the
lash combo I've been using a lot lately
are these three mascaras I've been
applying the falsies first on my top
lashes really love it it just really
makes my lashes go up and out if you can
kind of see and on top of that I put
this Estee Lauder sumptuous extreme
which is just an extreme black it's a
very nice thick mascara it just I don't
know it makes any mascara just look ten
times better so these two are must
together lately and then if I have any
clumpiness or anything like that I just
use my covergirl lash perfection which
is really nice as separating them bad
boys and just lengthening really well so
these three together
have been awesome okay next I wanted to
include my skin care team but I've done
a whole video on it so I'm not gonna
show you every single product if you
want to see my skin care routine it's
right here for you um I have just been
so happy with my skin I've been a lot
more confident a lot of you have noticed
a difference in my skin and it's just
all the products I've been using have
been amazing so I just I love everything
about my skin care but the one thing I
really want to talk about is this
Cetaphil oil control moisturizer this is
$18 at CVS I love this if you have
really oily skin you know it's annoying
whatever you go get a moisturizer and
you put it on because moisturizers are
so so so important everybody needs to
use one but when it makes you more
greasy and just shiny it just sucks it's
so hard to find a nice moisturizer for
oily skin especially one that's not too
high-end so I really love this one I
think it's fantastic does not make me
shiny really does moisturize my skin and
it has not broke me out at all so I
really recommend this stuff if you're
looking for a new moisturizer and you
have oily skin okay
next is a powder I've been loving my
rock and Republic powder and cashmere
this is just a pressed powder looks like
that I got this from outlook.com a long
time ago
if you don't know oh look is you
probably do but if you don't basically
just designer stuff that goes on sale
and you have a certain amount of time to
buy those or to buy the products so if
you're interested in Outlook I will put
the link down below that's where I got
this I think I paid $12 for this which
is amazing so I really recommend the
rocker Republic powders I've also been
using this eyeshadow a lot and this is
rath also got this remote look for like
$7 and this is what the color looks like
I'm just so in love with their
eyeshadows they're so soft so pretty I
really love them and that's just a light
like swatch this is it build it up I
mean it's just gorgeous so I really
recommend their eyeshadows as well next
it's just your plain ol NYX jumbo eye
pencil in milk I love this just a
highlight in my inner corners it's just
so great I don't know I've been using it
a ton
month I've been loving the brighter
inner corners a lot more so I really
really like this product okay next is a
blush in my NARS palette this is a NARS
Dan Mori palette this was available
around Christmas time last year start
from lighting you which is when I got it
I paid $60 for it comes with four
blushes a bronzer and a highlight since
I got this I know exactly what blush is
I'm going to purchase I just I love it I
think it's the best purchase I've ever
made but I've been using orgasm a ton
this month I know a lot of you know what
that is definitely been just reach into
it using it a ton next is eyeshadow now
I've been using Sedona lace eyeshadows
pretty much every day this month and the
palette I use is the 1:20 warm palette
but the one I've been going to because
there's two palettes in this so you have
like this one and this one but I've been
using the darker ones a lot more I just
think they're really really pretty and
very pigmented and then this little
eyeshadow is like a free sample pack I
got when I ordered my war text brushes
and that's just what it looks like it's
so pretty I absolutely love this color
been going to it a ton this month as
well so been loving some Sedona lace
eyeshadows next is this organics
nourishing coconut milk I know I talked
about this in my last favorites video
but I just wanted to bring it up again
very briefly just say I love this stuff
if you've never tried it and you want
like really soft and I really really
recommend this stuff and I got mine at
CVS okay my next favorite is this Sun
Goddess self-tanner
I do everybody on this I will link it
right here as well I absolutely love
this stuff if you know I have quit my
tanning beds and I'm in love with this
self-tanner it just makes me super dark
and I still have a lot more to go
through so yeah go check this off if you
haven't already
last thing that is in my favorites is
this Revlon extra life no chip topcoat I
love love love this stuff it is so good
it's really nice and shiny and it does
help the chipping like all the tips and
stuff on my nails which I really like so
I highly recommend this oh I forgot one
favorite I know I just got this but
is still my favorite it is my blue
pretty bag from Neela Anthony that I got
from low back black bag calm if you
haven't seen the video I'll link it over
here
I absolutely love this bag I think it's
so beautiful I have already got it
crammed full with like crap and stuff
you send my Sour Patch Kids
but I've got crammed full stuff just cuz
in the summertime I carry everything and
like a little puppy in there I'm totally
lying but I literally carry everything
in my person that's ever time so yeah I
absolutely love it if you want to what's
in my bag video just like this one and I
will definitely do it for you guys now
we're gonna get into the mini haul I
bought one two three four five six seven
new nail polishes and a couple of makeup
products I'm going to go through the
polishes real quick and then show you
makeup the first day I bought some more
mega last nail Pasha's I know I'm super
late on these but ever since I got that
I need a refreshment I've just been
totally obsessed if you're wondering
what I have on my nails today I am so in
love with this color it is on a trip
from a wet and wild and then I also
bought candy licious and Club Havana
really pretty colors okay and then I
bought just as regular Milani nail
polish the high speed fast dry formula
and this is just in white on the spot
which is just a really nice white color
then I bought two Revlon Colorstay ones
I think these are so pretty this one is
called passionate pink and then we have
coastal surf which is so gorgeous and
for this last one I don't really have
like a deep blue and I never tried
boreal nail pasha's before so if you've
tried and let me know what you think of
them down below but this is called jet
set to Paris and it's just a really
pretty blue color I just really really
like this one so I picked those up and
then for makeup products I bought just
another wet and wild blush this is in
mellow wine I don't have this color I
have all the other ones but just not
this one
and then I picked up this
blonde just bitten kissable balm it's
just a nude color not too sure how I
like it yet it's just a nice little nude
bomb um I kind of have to try it out a
little bit more to tell you if I like it
or not I don't hate it and I don't love
it so still experimenting with this but
if you're wondering this is what looks
like and it is new my CVS actually had
them out on display this weekend then I
picked this up which I really love so
far because I just had to go ahead and
try it it's the color rich lip balm SPF
15 and pink satin to me these are just
more expensive chap sticks but I think
they're so cute they are just so freakin
worth it and it smells really good and
it's actually really moisturizing on
your lips so I actually really like this
stuff I'm not a huge into the Revlon lip
butters they're just not my kind of I
don't know lip product I don't really
like them but I like that this is sort
of like a chapstick and it and it is
really hydrating so I like that then the
last thing is the one I am most well not
most excited I'm excited try all these
but I'm really excited to try its the
Maybelline volume express mascara the
mega plush is the gel mousse formula and
it has a flexor brush which I guess it
bends because you can see where they're
talking about it bends right there but
this is what it looks like I just
absolutely love the packaging so I had
to pick it up and let's see I've been
waiting to open it because I didn't want
to open it so I showed you guys but ah
is so such cute packaging I love this
packaging and it does like bend it's
like a bendy wand does that make sense
look at like Ben so I don't know if
that's a plus it's kind of a wet mascara
I can already tell but that's what the
bristles look like they're super big
they'll sell as bad as messieurs usually
do but yes so I'm excited to try this
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope you guys had a wonderful May and I
cannot wait for June so yeah I will see
you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
