messy top nut I had posted this picture
on Instagram a couple of days ago
and I had so many requests for tutorials
so I figured I would just show you guys
how I do my methi tapenade this is a
hairstyle like to go to if I'm going to
work or just going out and doing errands
or something like that so if you're
going to show you guys and let's go
ahead and get started
okay so we're gonna go ahead put our
hair up now what I like to do is make
sure my hair is parted where it usually
is and this is where it usually is
parted just having my bangs and then
whatever kind of part I have in the back
I never know what kind of part I have
going on on the back of my hair it just
kind of does whatever but I'm just going
to I'm not gonna put it all the way back
like this I'm just going to kind of
brush the two sides from the part and
put those back kind of finger comb my
hair so I'm just going to start from
here and put everything up so it was
just a really nice kind of messy
ponytail volume right here kind of messy
on the sides I do like to leave my
little baby hairs down just because it
just adds to the messiness I don't know
but what I like to do also is whenever I
get my ponytail up and get all my hair
in there or at least what I think I have
in there I like to take it and I'll hold
it about right here and push it forward
and this is where I tie my hair so I'm
just going to tie this in place it does
kind of get smushed down when you start
tying it but we're gonna get that volume
back here in a second I tie it really
tight bring in my hair through and then
I'm just going to pull the top part like
that and create some more volume and
I'll even tug on the front here just to
get some extra volume and keep in mind
we will have a lot of bobby pins so
we'll be Bobby pinning things that are
just a little too out of place like this
little hair it'll be bobby pin back more
but I don't even go to the sides and pay
a pool
now that we've got it up and like this
really messy pony
I'm gonna take my stock I just cut this
one I should go get the dark one since I
do have dark hair but I just cut this
off so this is I'm using today and I'm
just going to put my hair through the
stock and then I'm just gonna kind of
tug again and just kind of put my hair
around the stock they do have really
really long hair so then take couple
times to wrap this up nicely okay now
I'm going to start doing is just taking
sections from the front and I'm just
going to start shaping my hair around
like that and just start Bobby pinning
the crap out of it so I just kind of
like I showed you guys to I start from
the front here and I kind of just take
it push it up a little bit to get some
volume and take it towards the sock and
pin it in place and just kind of go
around my hair and do the same thing so
I'm just taking this piece right here
and spreading out my fingers pushing it
forward just kind of wrapping it around
and pinning it in place like that and
you're gonna want to cover the sock as
you go around because you don't want
people to see that you have a soft okay
and I'm gonna leave a little piece out
about that much I'm just gonna take the
rest of this and just put it around the
sock now you can also do like a really
neat sock bun this way
like really nice and put together but I
just like it messy and don't worry about
these yet we'll get to them right now I
just want to make sure I have my
sections nice and out for a run sock and
I'm wrapping all of my hair around this
way no no what this way would be that'd
be clockwise or counterclockwise I don't
know if I'm taking it all from my right
to my left
again just be messy with it nothing to
pull rest sighs I'll even start taking a
little bit of the side of my button
right here and just start pinning that
to my head just so it stays in place all
day long
so again just wrapping Phil I'm doing it
I have something you know my hair still
long just takes a minute to get it all
nice and
I'm just going to kind of tug on my butt
a little bit especially where there's
places where you can see the stock and
just kind of touch those pieces to
spread them out and cover the softness
and then I'm going to start taking all
these little pieces that are down - the
one I'm leaving out which is this one
so could you stay back there yeah just
go start running this around my bun and
just hitting it in place I don't want it
like I stay you know perfect or anything
it's just kind of I don't know it just
wraps around really nicely too
my eyes are swollen kids a cat a pure
rip to me I can't be anything you want
me to be
I did now the strength to just come
clean even we cannot it seems that I
could never look you in the face okay so
now we've got most of our hair wrapped
around the bun and I hope you guys I
have to light in the video for you to
see it but we've got most of the hair
wrapped around the fun a lot of bobby
pins and I'm here to to make sure this
stays really nicely and then now what
I'm going to do even with this hair
still out I'm just going to take another
hairband and I'm going to go over my bun
so I'm gonna go ahead and fit this under
I'm just going to wrap it around the fun
take lock it even more in place like
that again moving the hair around so you
don't see the stock now I'm just going
to take that same thing that seam here
I'm just going to wrap it kind of tuck
it in
I just really like the look of having
all the hair on top really messy and
then wrapping all the hair on the bottom
I don't know I just think it looks
really cute and that's pretty much how I
do it and if you feel like a little bit
of your hair is coming like to Ford and
showing the stock bobby pin that baby
down and then you see it really does
help cover it once you bobby pin it the
opposite way it'll hold that hair down
so you won't see the soft part and once
it's all cooped up you won't see it
either so go ahead and check the back
see what needs to be pinned up more and
you could kind of at this point like I'm
doing you can kind of pull things out
make it a little bit fuller and then
this is like a step that you can take if
you want to I'm just going to pull some
pieces around my face and you can see
that my hair is just sitting nice and
wrapped around the bun that's just how I
like it and like I said I do you might
hate baby hairs down all of us believe
down but I will take the back parts like
if I have a little hair sticking out I
look at those up and then the hairspray
I recommend for this hairstyle if you're
wanting to spray some hair back is the
Loreal Elnett hairspray this is the one
I've been using and I really love it
it's so easy to use and if you want to
take it down and brush your hair out you
totally can so all you can do and this
will help your bun stay in place oh and
then if you don't like as many fly wings
you can just spray them back and just
push them back with your hands and make
it look a little bit more put together
if that's what you like so this is my
messy top knot that I did and that
shirt and this is just what I've been
doing I hope you guys enjoyed this video
don't forget to like it and I will see
you guys in my next video
bye
was a lie right through my teeth and I
said I was trustworthy
I said I'd never ever live this way I'm
turning into everything that babe well I
was reckless with your lover no one ever
gave you I was reckless with your love I
know it never came</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
