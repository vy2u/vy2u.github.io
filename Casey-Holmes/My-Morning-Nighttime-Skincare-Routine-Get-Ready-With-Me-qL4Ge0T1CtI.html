all about my skincare routine and
instead of just sitting here and showing
you guys the products and telling you
about them I'm going to show you the
products in action so you guys will see
my morning skincare routine and also my
nighttime skincare routine and a lot of
you've been asking what's been going on
with my routines because you've noticed
a huge difference with my skin over the
past couple months and it has
dramatically changed
I definitely splurged this is definitely
not a cheap skincare routine I have
spent quite a bit of money on my
skincare but as you guys can tell it has
worked for my skin and it's just made a
huge huge difference administrator I sit
spick Chur right here the before picture
was from a couple months ago and it was
a get ready with me you can see my skin
is very very very red and just not
looking too great and then the picture
to the right is actually my most recent
foundation routine and that's without
any makeup and you can see that it is
totally changed now I love each and
every one of these products so I
recommend every single product that I
use especially if you have very oily
acne prone skin because I have very very
oily skin and as you can tell my skin is
very red so I hope you guys enjoy this
video please give it a thumbs up if you
did and don't forget to subscribe to my
channel and thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next
video bye
so after getting all that hair up out of
our face I'm going to take the
Neutrogena makeup remover wipes and
these are my all-time favorites I love
them they don't sting my eyes or
anything and I like twosies to take off
all of my makeup mostly my face makeup
but I do try to take off as much I
shadow and liner and stuff as possible
but it will go in with a eye makeup
remover here in a moment that will help
get everything taken off
so now I'm going in with my Matt cleanse
off oil I absolutely love this I got
this because Ingrid had mentioned it in
one of her videos and I adore it so this
is a must-have
it does take me a while to kind of
massage this all over my eyes but once I
get it done it just takes off almost
everything and it works so well
especially for waterproof mascara so
after I rinse that off I'm going to take
my Clarisonic Mia - and my purity face
wash which I love and I'm just going to
put this all over my face I'm just
following the steps that you're supposed
to use the Clarisonic this literally
changed my skin I think this is the most
beneficial item I have in my skincare
routine because it really deep cleans
and you'll see at the end of this how
dirty the brush is even after I used a
makeup remover wipe but even the texture
of my skin is just so amazing from using
this I highly recommend it it's the best
purchase I've ever made for my skincare
you can see all the dirtiness right
there and I rinse that brush head off
and then I'm going to rinse my face off
and sometimes I do have some eye
products I just don't want to get off my
face so I'm going to go ahead and dry my
skin off you can see I have a little bit
of eye products underneath my lower lash
line but I'll just go back in with a
Neutrogena makeup remover wipe and just
make sure my face is nice and clean
getting any of that excess eye makeup
and just clean up around the edges and
you'll see here this cloth has no face
makeup on it it just has the excess I
make up after my face is cleanse I'm
going to take my lush tea tree water and
spray this all over my face you want to
close your eyes and I just hold my
breath because I don't want to inhale it
but make sure you keep your eyes closed
for a second let it dry and then go
ahead and open them and just let it dry
before you put on your moisturizer I'm
starting with earth cream this is the
bobbi brown hydrating eye cream and I
love the stuff this is actually my
second bottle it is so good it's helped
my fine lines so much and then for
nighttime cream I'm taking my full of
promise from
Lavie I've actually had a subscriber
tell me I shouldn't be using this
because it's for older women but it's
really good stuff but I did go ahead and
buy another nighttime moisturizer and
I'll show you guys in a haul coming up
but lately that's what I've been using
and it's really really good so moving on
to a morning routine I'm getting up I am
NOT a morning person
I didn't even greet the camera so I'm
sorry but I'm just going to rinse off my
face and take my purity face wash again
I really love this stuff and I'm just
going to put this all over my skin I'm
not using the Clarisonic because I don't
need to really exfoliate in the morning
because my skin just needs to be
cleansed really so I'm going to go ahead
and do that and then rinse off my skin
when I'm done
so I'll cry
after that I'm just patting my skin dry
I always Pat it dry I never really
rubbed my face I read something
somewhere that you're supposed to Pat it
dry I don't think I don't know I think
it has some sort of benefit who knows
but I'm using my Neutrogena makeup
remover wipes again just to make sure
I'm squeaky clean on my face and I have
nothing left so when I do my makeup it's
going to be nice and smooth again taking
the tea tree water spraying this on my
face again I do this morning and night
it's so great and it really helps with
acne as well going back in with my Bobbi
Brown hydrating under eye cream I'm just
going to put this all underneath my eyes
as well and a Pat it in just like I did
in my nighttime routine and then for my
morning or daytime moisturizer I use
this philosophy take a deep breath I
love this it's an oil-free kind of like
gel formula it's really nice and it
stinks into the skin amazingly so it's
great for oily skin I hope you guys
enjoyed this please let me know what
other videos you want to see down below
and I'll see you in my next video bye
guys
