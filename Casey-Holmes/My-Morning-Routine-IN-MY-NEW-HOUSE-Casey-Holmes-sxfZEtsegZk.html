you
you
I swear that's the worst sound in the
world but it's time to wake up and I
swear I wake up before 1147 this is just
when I started filming I usually wake up
around 9:30 10:00 and then the first
thing I do is put on music and play with
my puppies because they make sure they
greet me every single morning so we just
play around and did you guys see Lee
Lily just throw that bone and the last
frame it was so funny so then we all
head downstairs and what I like to do in
this new house is open up all the blinds
I have so many windows in this house
that I get a lot of natural lighting so
I make sure I open up all of my blinds
and it also allowed a candle so then
it's time for the dogs to go out potty
and while they potty we do go out and
play a little bit just to kind of get
some energy out and then I got them this
kitty pool the other day and they have
been loving it fill up the kiddie pool
for them since it's a little bit warmer
outside next up is priority it is coffee
I have to have coffee in my life and
this Keurig has been one of the best
gifts I've ever received so thanks to my
step-mom because I absolutely love it
you know so while they're playing
outside I'm going to go upstairs and get
my outfit together so the first thing I
want to pick out is my jewelry because I
kind of had an outfit I wanted to wear
in mind so I'm a big gold jewelry person
and I love these new pieces that I got
from bauble bar you can actually get 20%
off if you go to bauble bar comm slash
KC with the coupon code KC my favorite
necklace from them is the Kourtney bib
it's so beautiful I have it in gold in
matte black I really love bauble bar
because they have a ton of different
styles and they're really great prices
they have like a lot of statement pieces
and also dainty jewelry as well and they
also started doing this thing where they
are personalizing a lot more necklaces
so it takes like four weeks I think to
get it in max I think but it would be
great for a graduation gift or any kind
of gift coming up since we are going
into summer and schools about to end so
definitely check those out down below
and if you want a discount you can go to
bauble bar comm / KC and use the coupon
code KC at your checkout for 20% off
send me some pictures if you guys get
some stuff because I love to see what
you're rocking after I've gotten my
shirt out of the closet I'm going to go
ahead and pick out the jeans and I love
these jeans from ASOS they're one of my
favorites so after that we are done and
we have our jewelry put together I
obviously couldn't decide which necklace
I wanted to wear so I was going to wait
and see when I put on all the clothes
now it's time to go downstairs and feed
the puppies so I go out and I get their
food and then bring them right back in
after I fill up their water bowls again
and they come in like good little
children I just love them then it's time
to put myself together and take a shower
so I'm going to go ahead and start the
shower and then take my hair out of this
messy bun
after my shower it's time to do
everything else so I'm going to be
brushing my teeth and doing all of my
skincare and putting on deodorant you
know the things we should all do every
single day
you
and it's time to brush out the hair and
I am using a wet brush it's specifically
designed to use when your hair is damp
and I'm going to take this living proof
full thickening cream and put this all
throughout my hair this just adds a lot
of texture and volume and then I'm using
the Kindred blow dry spray which is a
heat protectant and also creates a lot
of shine in your hair as well so my
blow-drying system is I basically just
flip it all over
I don't brush out my hair throughout the
process of blow-drying it I just blow
dry and then I'm done after all that's
finished I go into my computer room and
it's time to eat a little bit and also
catch up on some work and YouTube videos
I love Miranda sings and jennamarbles
they're just two of my favorite people
ever and then it's time to put my face
on so I'm going to sit down and do my
everyday makeup which is like my ten
minute makeup routine I do have a full
video on this if you guys want to check
it out I will link it in the description
box below but it's really simple just
using basic makeup products to make
myself put together oh and by the way I
did go for a second cup of coffee
because I was so tired this morning so
incredibly tired
oh and then my doorbell rang and nobody
ever rings my doorbell so here's my
reaction can you tell it was shocked
after that I'm just gonna go ahead and
apply my lip products and then we are
done with makeup I didn't do anything
for my hair because I was actually
getting a haircut this day so I just
left it so I'm going to take this outfit
and then switch into the one we chose
earlier in the video and this is what it
looks like I'll have everything listed
below where they're from and then again
I'm putting on that bubble bar necklace
and then putting on these shoes which
are my favorite shoes right now I got
them from Nasty Gal I think they're by
Jeffrey Campbell I could be wrong but I
adore them
they're like art on your feet I love
them and then that's it for this video I
really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching and don't
forget to thumbs up this video if you
liked it and I'll see you in my next
video bye is that rather big
Oh
