my nighttime routine I've had so many
requests for this so I decided to
finally do it for you guys and let's
just go ahead and get started first
thing I'm taking my Bobbi Brown instant
long-wear makeup remover and I'm just
going to put it on a round cotton swab
is that what you call them
I don't know cutting around who knows
and I'm just gonna let it sit on my eye
for a couple seconds and then gently
remove the makeup off my eyes I don't
focus too much on getting mascara off
completely
I just mainly focus on eyeliner
eyeshadow and then I also use this
underneath my eyes to take off the
under-eye concealer now to take off the
rest of my face makeup I'm taking this
bozo makeup breakup cool cleansing oil
hands-down love this I no longer use
makeup remover wipes because this takes
off all my makeup really really nicely I
just I love it it dissolves everything
doesn't break me out I highly recommend
this
next I'm going to rinse everything off
and then to further take off this
cleanse off oil I am going to use my
purity from philosophy and it's just
just going to take off any extra oil
that might have been left on my skin or
any makeup that's just being kind of
stubborn
and I am being really gentle with my
skin it looks like I'm being kind of
rough but I promise you I have gentle
fingers now I'm taking the first a
beauty skin rescue deep cleanser I love
this so so much it's a really gentle
cleanser and I use this just to actually
make sure my skin is nice and clean and
everything is out of my pores and it
makes your skin feel really really
smooth after you use it so oh I love
that stuff
and then tonight I'm using a mask this
is the glam glow hydrating mask our
hydrating treatment whatever and I'm
just going to put this all over my skin
and then after that I'm going to whiten
my teeth tonight and I'm using my dolls
malakut I really love this if you guys
want to see all the steps unlike my
December favorites video down below
actually showed you guys with Colton on
how to use this but I figured I would
just show you guys the gel and
everything like that and if you guys are
interested in this I will leave a coupon
code down below my teeth were a nine and
they went down to a four after I did my
treatment I was really happy with the
results I get from it and I wait about
20 minutes or so which is perfect
because the masks I leave on for 20
minutes as well so after that I just
rinse out my mouth all that gel and I
also rinse the mask off as well
after that I'm taking my estee lauder
advanced Night Repair Serum and I'm just
going to apply this all over my skin my
skin loves this stuff it just drinks it
right up and then I'm going to take my
Bobbi Brown hydrating eye cream and
apply this all underneath my eyes and
then we're taking my al Genest
restorative cream and applying this all
over the rest of my face
for the last step I'm taking this lush
lovely jellies is a breast cream but I
use this for my neck and my chest
it's a firming cream so it's great to
put something like this on at night you
don't want to forget your neck and chest
when you're moisturizing so that's what
I use this for I really love it keeps my
skin and I stay hydrated so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching don't forget to give
it a thumbs up if you did like it and I
will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
