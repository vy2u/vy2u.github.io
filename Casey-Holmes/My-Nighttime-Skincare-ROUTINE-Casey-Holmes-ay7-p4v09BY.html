showing you how I get my nighttime
skincare routine done and if you guys
enjoyed this video don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe and let's
just go ahead and get started so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to put my hair up but that's going to be
after I take off my false lashes because
it's the best part about taking off my
makeup I feel like it's false lashes I
feel like a weight is just lift it off
my face I love it so then I'm going to
go ahead and put my hair up into a bun I
just twist it around until it makes
itself into a little bun and tie it off
with a hair tie first step of taking off
my makeup I'm going to use the clinic
and take off the day cleansing balm I've
been using this for a while now and I
just love it it's one of my favorites I
also used the clinic cleanse off oil for
a while until I went to this but I just
feel like this is easier and it really
does get off all of the makeup the
Clinique take off the day line is by far
my favorite and like I said I've been
using it forever
I don't use makeup wipes or anything
like that I just use this to go ahead
and get most of this makeup off so once
I put it all over my face I'm going to
rinse it off and then I'm going to go in
with my purity face wash and I'm going
to wash my face this again I've been
using for a while because I do have
really sensitive skin so I don't like to
use anything too harsh and this has been
a great cleanser for me it's not too
harsh does it make my skin flare up I
just love it and then I don't do this
every night but tonight I wanted to do
it it's my friend up moisturize its
exfoliate and instead of using the one I
just showed you guys I did completely
use that up but I discovered a new one
that I absolutely love and it's this one
by Kate Somerville it is absolutely
amazing
the only thing bad about it is the price
tag but if you want something that's
really going to work and make your skin
very soft afterwards I would definitely
recommend that so then I'm going to go
ahead and wash that off and Pat my face
dry and then I'm going to take this
Neutrogena makeup wipe so since I don't
use them take off all my makeup on my
face I do use these to kind of clean up
any eyeliner or mascara that just is
being stubborn and doesn't want to come
off so go ahead and wipe all that off
and then I will move on to a face mask
again this is not an every night thing
but this is what
I do when I feel like my skin just
really needs a deep clean so this is a
glam glow super mud clearing treatment
and this is by far my favorite mask from
glam glow I purchased so many of these
and I just think they are absolutely
amazing it really cleans out my pores it
makes my skin really nice and tight I
did try the glam glow firming mask it
was really great if you follow me on
snapchat kind of saw what I went through
it was a great mask but I didn't like
the smell but this one hands-down my
favorite if I had to recommend any of
them to you it would definitely be this
one and I've tried almost all of them
other than the brightening treatment
it's just this one is a holy grail for
me and I only put it where I need it so
that's why I don't go all the way to my
hairline so I'm going to go ahead and
let that dry and then rinse it off and
then I'll move on to my eye cream and
this is the tarte maracuja eye cream as
you can see I already need a new one
which is the depressing because I just
got this not too long ago I feel like it
was probably months ago but I'm so in
love with this stuff it makes my skin
feel so great and keeps my under eyes
really nice and moisturized which is
very very important and then moving on
to face I will use the first aid Beauty
ultra Repair Hydra firm sleeping cream
guys this is amazing this is a really
thick cream for your face but after the
glam glow I need this I just need
something very hydrating and this one is
perfect for me I love love love it I've
been loving a lot of first a beauty
stuff lately and then moving on to my
neck I'm going to use the tarte maracuja
neck cream and I'm going to put this all
over my neck and decollete and this just
keeps that area nice and moisturized I
really like this cream for daytime and
nighttime uhm but yeah also I will do a
daytime skincare routine like for the
morning but I will only show that in my
morning routine so stay tuned for that
and then for my body I love this lock
seat on body butter it is so good you
guys the obsession is real I've gone
through so many of these it keeps your
skin so moisturized and if you have an
issue with dry itchy skin you need this
in your life then moving on to lips I
will do this exfoliator and lip
treatment a couple times a week so I
just use the exfoliator first and get
all of that dead skin
and then I will go in with the bomb and
put that on top I really love them I
think they taste good they taste like
Doublemint gum don't eat it though it
just if it gets in your mouth it does
taste good so that is it for this
skincare routine I really hope you guys
enjoyed it again if you do like it don't
forget to give it a thumbs up and let me
