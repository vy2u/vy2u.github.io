pamper nighttime routine this is what I
love to do whenever I want to just stay
at home and have a me day so I really
hope you guys enjoy it I'm going to show
you all the products that I use and yeah
we're just going to go ahead and get
started
you
you
first thing right when I walk into my
bathroom I love to light my candle I
feel like it just makes everything so
much more homey and really comfy so I've
been loving this candle from Bath and
Body Works I can't remember the name but
I will leave it down below for you guys
and the next I'll just take off all of
my jewelry and take down my hair which
is probably one of my favorite parts
even though I'm about to put it right
back up taking down my hair has to be
one of my favorite parts of the day and
I got a boo-boo on my head because I hit
my head on a corner so if you see that
don't mind it so I'm just put my hair up
and then putting on some music I've been
loving Beyonce's countdown song I've
just been like utterly obsessed with it
and then it's time to move on to my
nighttime skincare
all of these products I really love and
highly recommend if you guys are
interested in any of them I will leave
them down below but these of them I go
to items and I highly suggest them if
you're looking for something to replace
any item you're using now
now if you're breaking out this glam
glow mask is a lifesaver I swear by it
this is the only mask that ivory
purchased three times because it is just
so amazing I just apply it all over my
face mainly in my t-zone where my
problem areas are and just let it sit
and usually I'll take a bath or
something like I'm about to do now just
so it can really dry up and get rid of
all of that acne that you might have on
your face it's just a great way to clear
out your skin and get all of those
impurities out onto the back I'm just
using a random bath bomb from lush I
can't remember what it's called I think
it was from like the Mother's Day
collection or something but I'm just
going to put that in the bath and then
use these items while I'm in there which
again love them especially this
eucalyptus scrub it's amazing and of
course I can never get any privacy and
for some reason these dogs are just so
fascinated by bath bombs it's crazy
and then moving on to my nighttime
skincare what's going to really hydrate
my skin and make it feel nice and
refreshed
so after all my moisturizers are on I
like to moisturize my body with this
body butter from Lockett on I'm guessing
it's a really awesome moisturizer and I
highly recommend it if you have super
dry skin it's by far the best I've ever
tried in my life so now I'm going to
brush my teeth and then whiten my teeth
I wanted to use the dial smile kit but I
realized I was out of it right when I
was filming so I ended up using these
super booster pins which I do like these
as well but if I could recommend one
thing it would definitely be the dial
smell it is my favorite I just cannot
get enough of it so I'm gonna have to go
get me another one but I'm just applying
this all over my teeth and then you just
want to let it dry for 60 seconds and
you're good to go and you can see here
my sad face I was really sad that I was
out
now I'm probably the only 22 year old
that has a bed that actually moves up
and down like Grandma and Grandpa's bed
but I mean it's amazing and I'm so happy
I decided to purchase it so at the end
of the night I just like to get all my
social media my youtube and just watch
different videos and poor Lily you'll
see in a second here she wanted to get
up on the bed and had a little bit of a
hard time but she made it
so that is it for this pamper nighttime
routine guys I really hope you enjoyed
it thank you so much for watching and if
you want to see a room tour then just

you all in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
