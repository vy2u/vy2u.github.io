my September favorites I have quite a
bit of new stuff to show you and I'm
really excited about so I'm gonna go
ahead and go just get started because I
have a bunch of new things so the first
thing is my Sigma brushes this is the
mr. bunny set I love these brushes I've
been using them non-stop this month I
just think they are utterly amazing so I
definitely recommend these if you're in
the market I've also been loving this
f88 brush from Sigma for foundation I
love it so much it's been like the best
foundation brush I've used ever and I
just love how like precise the brush is
like the angle or whatever so I'm
obsessed with this brush it's so great
um really complete this is empty but I
want to show you guys these because I'm
in love with them it's the lumi finland
sensitive touch gentle cleansing wipes
so this is just makeup remover wipes you
can use and i love these they say
they're for um you know sensitive eyes
and stuff like that or sensitive skin i
totally agree
a lot of little makeup remover wipes
really hurt my eyes but these were just
amazing i love them so much let's talk
about foundation the foundation i've
been using a ton this month is revlon
colorstay
i do have two different colors a medium
beige for when i don't tan as often and
then fresh-faced for when i do self tan
so this is the revlon colorstay
for combination oily skin i get the one
with the soft flex i do leave yeah
because some of them don't have the soft
flex in them but I do have these that do
and I don't know if that makes a
difference I also have a mascara trio
I've been loving I will do a mascara
routine video very soon so and have the
covergirl LashBlast volume the covergirl
lash perfection and also this l'oreal
collagen infused mascara when you go to
the drugstore look for the mascara
that's in the all black tube if you
can't figure out the name because nobody
can ever remember this one's name
so just check that out also I of course
have been loving the dermablend
concealer in sable I've talked about
this so many times in my videos I love
it to cover redness and then for
underneath my eyes has been the Rimmel
match perfection concealer and light
that's just been my everyday go-to
concealer I love it
all right next
keep it on trend with the eyes
maybelline eye studio palette and cozy
cashmere I love this I have a getting
ready video with me using it there was a
ton of positive feedback so thank you
guys so much for that this is definitely
my favorite palette ever from the
drugstore they've ever ever purchased so
love this palette perfect for fall I
think it's so beautiful
and then for liners my favorite liquid
liner of the moment is this Rimmel
exaggerate liner I'm obsessed with this
I think it's so nice that's what it
looks like and it has like the felt tip
end but just check out how black this is
it was so black and with this being such
a stiff felt tip it has been wearing
down which I do like it when felt it's
do that but it's so easy just to get
really close into a fine line in your
inner corner and then work it out to a
thicker wing so this has been my
favorite liquid liner of the month for
stick eyeliner it's been the L'Oreal hip
Paris liner I've been using this a lot
been really really liking it last thing
for eyeshadows is this urban decay vegan
palette um I love my naked palettes but
this one I go to a lot just to kind of
do a brown smokey eye with I'll use
small all over me all over my lid so I
use this color all over my lid and then
I used twice the bait which I think this
what's called yeah twice baked in the
crease and just really smoke it out
those two have been like my go-to colors
for a darker eye and I'm obsessed and
this palette is so nice I mean the
colors are just beautiful I haven't
really experimented with the blues or
anything but I mean these are just
gorgeous gorgeous colors so right
- palate if you ever see it again I know
they usually have them on HauteLook or
urban decay common sales so favorite
blush of the month has been another
Rimmel blush you guys now on cow up is
my favorite blush also from Rimmel it
was my favorite for last month and
that's also another favorite but I
wanted to include this one this is in
spring flower this is such a gorgeous
everyday color it's beautiful it can
kind of act as a contour color or
contour shade too because it gives you a
darker blush color I don't know if you
can really tell but since it has that
darker color on the end it just really
deepens it and it's such a beautiful
beautiful color so love that and then
nail polish I recently just got this
I've been wearing it but I'm obsessed
with it it's the simple colors nail
polish and muse I think this is one of
the newer nail polishes that they came
out with this is what it looks like it's
very pretty color last favorite is a
powder and it is my Maybelline Dream
matte powder I'm in sand medium oh one
that's what it looks like I feel like
this is more of a transparent powder
than just one that's gonna give you a
lot of color payoff or give you like a
full coverage finish it's definitely not
gonna do that
um this is a powder I like to take with
me everywhere block throughout the day
and just like matte my face so in the
beginning of the month I noticed I was
starting to have a lot of product
buildup in my hair it was driving me
absolutely insane like I couldn't
blow-dry the back of my head completely
like it just felt like there was so much
product in my hair I saw miss summer oxy
talked about this in her last favorites
video thing goes August favorites and
she said it was really nice that deep
cleaning your hair making Authority I
was like you know I'll go pick it up and
then is the darn 8:44 defying shampoo
pure clean um I love this one use of
this stuff and it completely cleaned my
hair all product build up was gone and
it's just amazing it smells really good
too it's just one of the best kind of
really deep cleaning shampoos I've ever
used in my life um I do only use this
about once a week
I wouldn't recommend this being your
daily shampoo or anything
like that but it's great for like a once
a week thing just a really deep feeling
you get all the dry shampoo out of your
hair all hair products everything just
completely wipe your hair clean and
start fresh again so this has been a
huge favorite of mine so I figured since
I had so much product build-up in the
month it probably was my dream my
shampoo and conditioner so I decided to
change them up and it has definitely
helped a lot I was using the Dove oil
infused or something like that I don't
know I had like the oil stuff on the
front I used that for a while and I felt
like that was what's probably made my
hair so gross and product build a big
issue but I've been using the clear
scalp and hair therapy shampoo for
damaged color treated hair I'm obsessed
with this I have the conditioner in the
shampoo I love them both they're really
great they don't weigh my hair down or
anything like that so I do recommend
these products if you're in the market
for a new shampoo and conditioner now
more for when I get out of the shower
these have been the two products I have
used every single time I don't wash my
hair every day but when I do wash my
hair these are the products that I use
I've been using the healthy sexy hair
soy trial eat leave-in conditioner I'm
obsessed with this product this is what
it looks like it's a leave-in
conditioner like I said but it is one of
the best I've ever used it smells really
good and it just leaves my hair so soft
like I'll spray it in my hair before I
wide toothed comb it and it makes
everything so much easier and it's just
fantastic so I really really recommend
this and then after I comb out my hair
and before I blow-dry it
I applied the scar need for teeth sleek
and shine blow-dry Perfector this is a
straightening balm with argan oil and it
says 24-hour frizz protectant or
resistance whatever but this is what it
looks like I really really like this
stuff um like I said I want to do a
pea-sized amount and I only apply it
from about here down so like all my ends
because it can soar way down your hair
if you put too much product in it or if
you use too much of this product it can
really easily weigh that hair down but
if you don't use too much product and
you use this before you blow dry which
you're supposed to duh
it is amazing I love it so much
sometimes I don't even straighten the
bottom half
here I'll just drain like my bangs right
here because like it's already straight
and I don't need to take your
straightener over it especially if I'm
going to work or something I won't run a
straightener over it I'll just kind of
leave it after a blow-dry so that's
really awesome this is great I love it
next is a dry shampoo I am a dry shampoo
junkie I love trying new ones but the
one I've been using a ton I'm almost
through two sprays already for the month
which is kind of crazy but it's the dry
shampoo I hate the name because I hates
hand the name in videos but this is a
really great dry shampoo it's like six
dollars and some change at Walgreens and
this just reminds me of something old
school like you remember the barbershops
that had like the little candy canes or
I call him candy canes but they have
like the little twirly things with all
the colors that's what this reminds me
up like that matters but this is what it
looks like I love it I love it I love it
it's been my favorite I still want to
try a batiste and I'm gonna try the one
from suave - I heard I think it's no
doves the one that runs out really
quickly I've heard swap is really great
so I want to try that and I want to try
the batiste
so I'm just a direction food junkie but
I've been using this like crazy I love
it so much so great great dry shampoo
two more things and I'm done I promise
so next is don't make fun of me because
my bottle is pretty horrendous
it's my self tanner this is nice done
got a self tanner I have been using this
ever since I got it this is what it
looks like
I know if sturdy it's probably pretty
disgusting I love this stuff it's in
dark it's just my favorite self tanner
it looks so natural I have it on the
bottom half of my body today I just am
obsessed with it it has a green
undertone which you can kind of see on
the nozzle and stuff like where it's
dried in the screen that's great it's
gonna be like that olive color and it's
perfect so you don't like orange or
anything like that I am in love with
this stuff I have a video all about it I
have a video of me applying it and
everything so I will leave that video in
the bottom bar if you are interested but
this has been a holy girl I'm actually
about to repurchase another one because
I have about like that much left it's
amazing also if you use the fake fake
flawless let me know if you wash this
and if you do how the hell do you wash
it because I don't know it needs to be
washed is completely horrible like it's
dirty it's disgusting but I don't feel
like buying a whole new um like fake
fake kit with the self-tanner just to
get the mitt because I don't really like
that self-tanner anymore it's just it
doesn't does it doesn't even compare to
the Sun Goddess
but if you know how to wash this mitt
let me know because I have no idea last
thing is a perfume this is probably my
favorite perfume for about two years now
because it's just one that I always go
back to and one I always continually
love and it is the Viva La Juicy perfume
it's the cutest bottle ever but I've
been using a lot lately to try to use it
up because I really want to get a new
perfume but every time I use it it just
reminds me like it reminds me of why I
love it like I will repurchase this
again because it is such a long-lasting
perfume like I will spray this on my
body and then I will still smell it till
the next day like it's insane it smells
delicious I've never heard anybody say
that they don't like the smell of this
because it's phenomenal the new one is
even better it's the Lafleur oh my gosh
it's even better
so I don't know my next perfume shopping
spree I'm gonna have I really want the
Jimmy Choo one I'm sorry I haven't liked
getting a sec my micro it Scratchy okay
can we not oh but I want to get the
Jimmy Choo one that kind of looks like a
grenade which is probably like a
horrible way to describe it it really
doesn't look like a grenade but it's
like in a round bottle and then I might
purchase this one again and a LeFleur
but this is lasting me so long and it
still smells delish like I'm obsessed
with it and it just it's amazing if you
have never ever tried this I recommend
you trying it out it is very expensive
personally I feel like but it's an
amazing perfume and it's totally worth
it I'm telling you the smell lasts
forever I love it so that was all my
favorites for the month of September oh
I have one more favorite and that's my
cue
I love it so much Canon Rebel t4i if you
guys are wondering if analog people ask
me about lens it's the eighteen to one
thirty-five millimeter I'm obsessed with
this camera I love the quality I hope
you guys are liking the lighting better
in this video where I'm more bright in
the back it's kind of like not as bright

some kind of light to shine down back

know so I hope you guys enjoyed this
