get to film this skincare video I have
wanted to film it since I've started my
channel and I swear to you every time I
say I'm gonna fill the skincare routine
I end up breaking out the next day so I
wanted to make sure I had something that
I really loved and actually really
worked for me so yeah if you guys have
watched my other video I told you I was
breaking out around my neck underneath
my jaw and stuff and it was just so bad
I never broke out like that before I
went to the dermatologist and he did
prescribe me some stuff but I'll let you
know what that is first I'm gonna get
started with what I do to take off my
makeup and the two I use two different
um face wipes the only ones I've used
for forever and they're just the only
makeup remover towelettes they look like
this think there are about $7 at CVS and
I don't know five seven dollars and then
I use these ponds wet cleansing
towelettes all day clean with vitamin E
um I think I'm just gonna start
purchasing the ponds now because I
really do like them they have five more
talents to them and they are a lot
cheaper than these all main ones but I
really do suggest these because I think
they're amazing
also when I take my eye makeup Office's
ponds cold cream so it looks like I've
been trying this out and I really really
love it I don't know if it's like a cold
cream it's very creamy and it smells
kind of like baby powder which I don't
really don't have a problem with but you
don't like baby powder you'll like it
but that's what I used to take off my
eye makeup I just gently put it on my
eyes and then just take it off I use
these little cotton rounds that I got
from CVS for I think like 3 or 4 bucks
so when I'm actually washing my face I
kind of switch it up between these two
the first one is definitely the Savino
positively radiant skin brightening
daily scrub I love this stuff it's just
so nice on my skin and it smells so good
and it definitely brightens up my face
so I highly recommend this and then this
I recently got but oh my gosh I am so in
with this product I cannot stress enough
how much of a difference this is made on
my skin this is the shea taro organics
rose hips black soap deep pore facial
cleanser it's 100% natural and it says
microdermabrasion in a bottle this is
what it looks like I did show this in my
last video and I'm absolutely in love
with it you can totally tell the
difference with some cleansers you know
it cleans your skin but it doesn't feel
like so clean that I mean you just know
when your skin is really clean and when
I apply this stuff all I do is I just
put it all over my face let it sit there
for about five minutes then I rinse it
off and it is just amazing it is so
clean I think this has definitely helped
a ton with my skin I think it's about
$40 something like that but this is so
great I absolutely love it I can't can't
stress it enough the only thing I do
hate about that is it smells so bad so
so so bad but I love what it does to my
skin so I don't want to smell eMED as
long as it does what it says and it does
so for moisturizers or let me just go
with toner the toner I've been using and
really liking is a CVS alcohol-free
toner just to pray plain studious brand
I really like this it doesn't have the
alcohol in it I was gonna get the 99%
alcohol and I was like no let's just go
full on no alcohol and I really like it
a lot better and it's compared to the
Neutrogena alcohol-free toner so before
I do put on my moisturizers I've been
loving this - oh I love it so much it's
the sample of the Shea Tara organics
argan green coffee eye serum I've been
putting this underneath my eyes every
night after I wash my face and I have
just absolutely been loving it they did
give me like a little sample but this
stuff has done such an amazing job
underneath my eyes with just brightening
and really kind of like firming and
making me look more awake when I'm
really not awake at all but I love this
stuff so amazing
so when I went to the derma did give me
a pill to take every day for two weeks
don't know the name of it it's like in
my purse somewhere but it has like all
my information on it so I'm not gonna
show you but he did prescribe me two of
these little lotions and it's like the
clinton phosphate topical lotion i don't
know but this is what it looks like he
prescribed me two of these bottles and i
applied twice a day i found that when i
put this on my face in the mornings it
made him more like oily and just like
not cute so i only applied this to my
neck chest and back in the mornings and
then i'll apply to my face neck chest
and back at night so yeah that's what i
use and for the morning when i apply
moisturizer to my face the one i love to
use is this Cetaphil oil control
moisturizer which I'm absolutely in love
with I think this is one of the best
moisturizers for oily skin that I've
found it definitely helps control the
oil and it's for acne prone skin as well
so I love love love this set of the
lotion okay so the last thing I talked
to you guys about is a tool this is a
personal microdermabrasion and this is
from PMD and I absolutely love this
I have not stepped up from the white cap
yet because I'm kind of scared to but
you supposed to start out with the white
cap and then you can work your way to
all these different caps that they have
for you the bigger ones are pretty body
the smaller ones are for your face but I
just haven't stepped up from this one
yet cuz I'm really loving this and I'm
just kind of staying with it for now
but it comes with a cord so you just
plug it in which I really like and then
it has the on and off switch it's a cute
just like little travel-size thing I
don't know it's not too big too heavy
anything like that and then you also get
two of these little caps on it I think I
do believe this one's for your body so
it does come in a box like this I highly
highly highly recommend you watching the
DVD I learned a bunch of stuff that I
would never even guessed but it's so
informative and it's just you really
really really need to watch it just so
you make sure you don't mess up your
skin but you just wanna make sure you do
it right because this is a serious
little tool so what you're going to do
with this it you turn it on and you want
to pull down on your face and you're
just going to sit there wait for it to
suck up your skin you don't want to like
sit there and press down
your skin cuz that's gonna like mess it
up so wait til it sucks up your skin and
once you feel that you're which you will
I promise you're just going to start
gliding it up like this and you're just
gonna follow that motion you always want
to work your way up and another thing
you don't want to go over the same area
too many times because I can really
damage your skin and don't go near your
eyes because we all know that's delicate
so just remember to do upward strokes
like that this has definitely helped me
with acne scars and stuff like that it's
just made my skin a lot more radiant and
it made everything like my moisturizers
and all that stuff just really sink into
my skin and do what it's supposed to do
so I really really love this product I
just obsessed with it so I think this
and I want to get a Clarisonic because I
feel like if I have this in a Clarisonic
those will be like my main two products
I have to have all the time so I
definitely recommend everybody picking
up or at least trying out personal
microderm abrasion because it's a lot
cheaper this way and you don't have to
go to the dermatologist and like wait
for hours to do it when you can just go
ahead and do it at home so hope you guys
enjoyed this skin care video like I said
I am so excited I finally am able to get
this up for you guys
I have not like broke out or how like a
pimple it's like a week or so and it's
just crazy to me and I'm so excited so I
hope you guys enjoyed this let me know
if you try out any of these price or if
you have them and let me know how you
like it and yeah so I will see you guys
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
