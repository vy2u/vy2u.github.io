skincare routine I've had a ton of
questions about my skin and I decided to
finally do this video how the way you
guys are gonna have to excuse my hands I
have been exfoliating them like crazy
and they actually kind of hurt but I use
this Sally Hansen spray last night like
the leg spray I was like oh let me see
if it makes my hands tan and oh my gosh
oh my god it was so bad I'm trying to
exfoliate my knuckles really really bad
I've been like going and random times in
the bathroom I'm like I can't get it off
though so you're gonna have to excuse my
hands because I used a new product last
night I'm not using that Sally Hansen
thing anymore now I don't have a lot of
products because I'm a very simple
person when it comes to skincare I
probably should want to work really hard
but I don't want to have to like work
really hard by bunch products to be able
to get my skin clear so my skin is not
perfect now if you used to watch me in
the beginning of last year to kind of
the mid year I'd say torque because
towards the end of the year my skin got
a little better but my skin was really
really bad it was really red here in the
t-zone and I don't know what the palm
was I used to think I had kind of like a
little bit of rosacea and it kind of
really reacted to a bunch of different
things I do and I don't know I just
switched up my skincare routine and it's
been great ever since and my skin has
gotten a lot better with the redness it
still is a little bit red but you know
it's not as bad as it used to be so I'm
gonna first start with face wash now I
forget where I read this at but it was I
was reading stuff on skincare and it was
saying if you have redness you don't
want to use a harsh face wash that's a
tongue twister you know every single day
because I can really make your skin
react and irritate it and you just don't
want to do that so right when I read
that I went out and I bought a nice just
cleansing face wash so the one I bought
is as simple sensitive skin experts
refreshing facial wash gel and I got the
gel one because I knew it'd be good for
oily skin because usually the gel stuffs
pretty good for it but
this is what it looks like and I think
this was pretty cheap by the drugstore I
can't remember
I have probably one more use out of it
but it's pretty much gone and this has
been amazing like I've seen such a huge
transformation with my skin I totally
believe what I read because I used to
use a gentle exfoliator almost every day
and my skin was really red so when I
switched to this it really helped like
not irritate my skin at all and it was
just awesome and it actually takes off a
lot of makeup so I really like this
product this does not dry your skin it
says non drying on there and I totally
agree with it because you know sometimes
when you use face wash your skin kind of
feels like everything just got sucked
out of it and it's just done this does
not make you feel like that it actually
feels really good and your skin doesn't
feel like it's overly dry because you
don't want your skin to feel like that
so I love this product I'm really
actually loving the simple brand you're
about to see a couple more things from
them I think they're great and you know
my whole redness I feel like was from
having sensitive skin to products that I
was using so I kind of went towards the
products that are most used for
sensitive skin and it has really really
worked for me okay so when I do an
exfoliate because it is good to
exfoliate your skin you know you're
supposed to exfoliate it helps your
makeup go on better and it just gets the
dead skin off I have still been using
the Aveeno positively radiant skin
brightening daily scrub and this is a
gentle exfoliant and it really is gentle
and it's so wet right now because I just
cut out the shower but it does exfoliate
the skin and make your skin really
really smooth so I love this product I
think it's great I've used this since my
last skincare routine and this is just a
product I'll use probably once or twice
a week just to you know make my skin
extra smooth get all the dead skin off
whatever and I love it okay so for my
everyday moisturizer my go-to since I
bought this a couple months ago or no
it's probably been a few months ago it's
been a while but it's the Cetaphil oil
control moisturizer now I have very very
very very very oily skin I should have
said this in the beginning of the video
but I have very oily skin so I like to
go towards things that are poorly
skinned but this is what the moisturizer
looks like I
absolutely love it to death it's the
best one I've used yet especially from
the drugstore it is expensive I think I
paid like 1819 dollars for it but it's
my favorite and I actually like it a lot
more than the Clinique when is it the
one the Clinique one in the yellow tube
for oily skin I think that one broke me
out because I did not like it at all I
do remember I didn't like it and I tried
it once months back I love this stuff I
think it's amazing it's successful
through the drugstore you could probably
get a cheaper at Walmart because I do
shop at CVS a lot so they're a little
bit higher I don't know I just I love
CVS and always have coupons so that's
why I was shot there instead it feels a
great brand anyway so check that out and
then for underneath my eyes this is just
a newer purchase but I've really really
been loving it it's been my under eye
area is so smooth and just look really
flawless so what I've been using is the
Dermalogica total eye care and I got
this at Ulta I just ordered it offline
and got it but it's really really really
nice moisturizer I actually use this day
and night and it has SPF 15 in it and
let's see it says the Afghan I can
conceal dark circles have sizes
companies you can't I think I like the
food let's get moving alpha hydroxy acid
and plant extract optical light with you
this help diminish the impact I suppose
and chemical free things ain't helped to
shield against further damage
so I love this I really wanted to get
like an eye cream specifically for my
eyes because I hadn't really been into
an eye cream but I really really wanted
to get one so this was a lot of chose I
figured you know it's my eyes I'm okay
it's okay to spend a little more then
you went at the drugstore for regular
eye creams and then last but not least
is facial wipes now I am very very very
picky on the facial wipes I don't like
you to sting my eyes and I like you to
break me out and some of them actually
irritate my skin like they will be so
strong they will just completely make my
skin red and I can always tell whenever
it's just not gonna work out for me
the ones I have been using lately is the
simple brand actually bought this I
don't
a couple like a week ago or so and I've
really been liking these or these are
really really great I also love the
Neutrogena ones in the blue package I am
like obsessed with those and then the
lumi finland ones i think that's how you
say it is l um II and II but I love
those two they're great for sensitive
skin just try them out and if you don't
like them you don't like him but I've
really been liking these simple
sensitive skin ones there it says it
removes waterproof mascara I don't wear
waterproof mascara but you could always
try that out if you're interested so
those are all the products I use for my
skincare I hope you guys enjoyed it I'm
a really simple person when it comes to
it I just like to make sure my products
work and if they work then you know I
don't need anything extra to go into my
regimen thank you so much for watching I
love you all very much and please look
forward to a makeup tutorial soon I'm
going to have one up I've been kind of
