be my must-haves for spring kindness
summer as well i know i'll be using a
lot of this in the summer and I figured
I'd show you guys like some makeup and
hair clothes just a couple of different
you know things I never really show
closed in my videos but i figured i do
it today because I've gotten a lot of
cute stuff
I'm not really a dress kind of girl I
have to be really in the mood for a
dress but I can wear rompers all the
time they're my favorite but this is one
of my favorite ones I've had this for a
couple years now this one's from belk
and it just cinches at the waist it's
super cute i just love the pattern it's
so vibrant and i just i love it it's
gonna be so pretty so if you've watched
my videos for a while you have seen us
in where my older videos and it's just
perfect I love it so much another one is
when I got recently this one's from
Windsor and it kind of has like that
tribal print it's so cute and has a belt
in the middle and it's just a really
nice loose fabric so it's not going to
be too hugging to the body make it
really really hot I don't think I'm
obsessed with the for spring and summer
is denim I love denim vest now I think
these are so cute this one's from
jessica simpson and i got this at TJ
Maddux in this one's in a size small
it's a little big but it's a nice
lightweight you know vest and it's not
going to make you too hot or anything
you just throw this over a take or
whatever you want to do so yep love that
and then this is what I've also had from
last year as well from forever 21 it's
just like a light green type of color or
really like yellow maybe a light yellow
I can never decide on what color is
super cute fits so well and this isn't a
medium so I love it and then this vest
is when I bought recently and it's a
white one and it just has really cute
studying on it and I just I love it so
cute again in the mediums was 20 to 80
and I love it now these are going to be
like my number one staple piece for
summer and it's just cute flowy shorts
once with patterns ones with anything I
just absolutely love cute shorts parent
would like just a simple top dislike my
new favorite thing right now so the
first one I'm going to show you these
are from forever 21 this pair is just
like a drawstring type of thing but the
fabric is so nice and loose and it's not
cheaply made and it should
really really cute i love the olive go
great with like this tank and i just
think it's so nice and I thought quite a
bit of these and I just I can get enough
of them and they're really cute you just
tuck your shirt in and they also have
pockets which is awesome these are like
my favorite pair that i bought these are
also from forever 21 I don't know what
kind of print this would be I guess that
I cat kind of print but it's adorable I
love it it's so bright I saw them and I
was like God have it and they're just
stretching in the back and have like a
plain fabric front and I just love them
they're so cute and all these little
shorts from forever 21 are under twenty
dollars and a lot of them are under 15
so i definitely recommend them these
last pair are from love culture they
have just a little bow on them and they
have a bunch of different colors i got
another pair in black just you know to
pair with pretty much anything but i
love the strike was i think they're so
cute again they're just stretchy in the
back and have the cute little bow so yes
i love them these the shorts are going
to be like my main focus because it's
always fun to change up your shorts
instead of just having you know a pair
of denim shorts on the bottom she could
always just do a really cute pair and
have a plain top and be good to go
and for makeup the first must have for
me is primer things that are also going
to keeping that my primer has keep me in
a pretty matte so the one I love is this
eve pearl anti-shine magnifying gel now
this is really going to keep you nice
and that in oil free you can really feel
it like dry my face it's pretty intense
but it works amazingly i bought a backup
of this because i know during the
summertime this is definitely going to
be my go-to for people that don't have
super super oily skin you can also use
this the benefit Porefessional it really
makes your pores like disappear it's
amazing another thing is making sure i
have ai primer at all times always have
to have eyeshadow primer because
otherwise my eyeshadow will not stay on
it won't even belen well or anything so
my mac paint pot in itself edgar is a
must-have sometimes I'll even put this
on and just go with this by itself
because if you have any discoloration on
your lids or any kind of veins showing
this will camouflage them it just create
a really nice canvas next is face I
definitely recommend if your men wear
foundation make sure you have a very
long wearing one once that I love and I
talked about all the time is a makeup
forever map that plus this bar so long
on me keeps me really mad and it just
looks awesome so I can't say enough good
things about this I want to try the kat
von d foundation and you guys have tried
that let me know what you think of it
down below and if you have oily skin let
me know what you think of it because
I've kind of heard I've ever heard a lot
of bad things about it for oily skin but
I don't know but another one that's
great from the drugstore is the cover of
outlast stay fabulous 3 and 1 i've
talked about this a lot i use this in
mind get a flawless face with drugstore
products video and i will link that down
below but this is awesome it's very long
wearing and it's actually really great
for oily skin I feel like for the summer
time I am going to have to pair it with
the eve pro primer just to make sure I
don't get to Orly throughout the day or
anything and then if you don't wanna
wear foundation you can always use a BB
cream but i love this is the
real Paris magic's game beautifier
beauty cream in medium and it says it
Prime's corrects hydrates and perfect so
this is what it looks like it comes out
as like a white liquid so it comes out
like this but once you rub it in it just
turns the color supposed to because i
think i have like little beads and it
really does you know even out my skin
tone make it look really nice this was a
lot better than the revlon BB cream
because it's not as greasy or anything
like that so this is great for oily skin
if you're looking for a BB cream and you
have really oily skin this is the one
that you know i recommend i do recommend
of course sending it with a powder but
otherwise it's great love it speaking of
setting with powders I have two that i
recommend because I always I always
recommend setting your makeup with the
powder because it's just gonna last a
lot longer it's just gonna look really
nice so the first one is my make up for
ever met billet plus you guys know I
talked about this one a lot as well so i
also have an alternative though that
i've really been loving and it's the
knicks mineral said no credit matte
finishing powder very similar to the
make up for ever one and this is also
great to set your otherwise your face
anything like that so sending your
makeup with this and then having like
blotting sheets and a blonde and pattern
throughout the day we'll just really
keep your makeup nice and fresh the next
makeup product is a long wearing
concealer because i love to wear
concealer underneath my eyes and i want
to make sure last all day and this one's
great it's the mac pro longwear
concealer and mine is in NC 20 this is
awesome i love you so much it doesn't
crease underneath my eyes it stays put
early all day i never have a problem
with it budging and then the last things
are the color whispers i have been
loving and i think they're perfect for
spring because they just create a really
pretty sheen to your lips if your not
wanting to be very bold with color these
are the way to go so i actually have
three the pedal rebel which is like my
favorite is it my person i just don't
feel like getting it but these are the
two i have we have coral and
mission right yeah perfect coral shade
if you want to wear coral but you don't
want it to be too in your face doesn't
make your teeth look yellow and it's
just not too much have it on my lips now
I love it I think it's so pretty I
really could get enough of this one so
quarrel ambition one of my favorites and
then another favorite is my Allah lilac
which is just a nice little purple color
and even with these color whispers I
like to mix them all together makes one
or two together I mean they all look so
pretty now I don't think that they're
super moisturizing but they're just
great to kind of keep in your purse and
just add a pop of color to your lips
I've kind of been verging away from
super super nude lips and kind of adding
a little bit of color in to my lips my
look so these are what I've been go to
forward nail polish I just have a couple
first one is from Julie G's nail polish
line this is bikini so not just bikini
huh but this will look like it's like a
neon coral pink color it's beautiful and
it's super super cream so I really
recommend that one this nail polish is
called in the Cabana it's a really
pretty blue color and I have one of
their newer um now polishes on too I
think this is called first timer I'll
put it down below exactly what it is I
can't remember this green color but this
is also from their new collection the in
the Cabana and it's so pretty i love it
i love this one more than bikini so
teeny then another one i want to mention
is the china glaze neon polishes this
one's in shocking pink and i love their
neon polishes i bought a few back in the
winter time actually because I was like
craving summer make sure you put a white
polish down first like just a layer of
white polish and then put this on top
it'll be a lot more vibrant and it just
looks a lot prettier with that white
base so i love these hosses though they
are very very me on and just so pretty
the last two products I want to talk to
you guys about our for your hair I know
dream of spring and summer a lot of
screaming going to the beach the pool
delay so when you're out and in the pool
with chlorine and all of that earth
beach ball that saltwater you definitely
want to steal tin to your hair so i have
two products that are still going to
keep your hair really nice and soft for
summer so the first one is this 12
benefits instant healthy hair treatment
there's just 12 different things just a
couple I'll tell you it prevents Lytton
strengthens fragile hair protects from
chlorine win and sun damage and shine
text from blow drying it does so many
things i used to us all the time when I
was blonde but I still really love it
actually have a little bit left in this
one and a whole nother bottle that I
need to use but I'm going to keep in my
pool bag for summer if you guys want to
see like what's in my pool bag then just
let me know down below cuz I'll
definitely do it but I love this you
could always just get out and pull spray
your hair with this and just let it soak
in and I'll make your hair really nice
and shiny and just really smooth and
then another thing could also use is oil
and this one I just I love I think it's
so awesome is the new me organics argan
oil and I just love putting a tiny tiny
bit of this like probably a little bit
less than a dime sized amount I'll put
this in my ends and it leaves it so soft
and healthy and i definitely recommend
something like this if you're going to
be at the beach because salt water can
do some serious things to your ends so
you can always just add this after you
get out of the ocean and it just won't
make your hair feel so prettily at the
end so definitely recommend this little
I'll have to put this in like a
different little bottle for my pool bag
but oh yeah it's gonna be great so those
are all my must-have products for spring
