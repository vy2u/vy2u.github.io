be my spring/summer foundation routine I
do have very oily skin so if there's
some girls out there that have the same
then this video will work just right for
you so the foundation that I'm going to
be using is this NARS sheer matte
foundation they also have one for like
dry skin or I think it's like
combination skin whichever one I don't
know but the one in the frosted glass is
the sheer matte and then the one in the
clear glass is or like dry skin but I
really love this foundation I'm in the
color medium dark I also would recommend
if you go to Sephora ask them if they
have a pump I didn't get one I don't
know when I got this I was like oh it'll
include a pump you know it's $45 and it
definitely doesn't so as you can see if
they have a pump there for you um if not
you just have to pour it on the back of
your hand or whatever this foundation
goes so well with my skin I just I'm in
love with it before I bought this I did
a ton of research and you know did a lot
of YouTube video searching and I for the
Olli skin girls I saw that they totally
recommend the list though when I picked
it up and tried it out I fell in love so
I'm recommending it to you guys um I do
use a couple other products throughout
the video which you will see but um yeah
also if you're interested in seeing how
I got this hair I will link the tutorial
down below and also one more thing
whenever I get to ten thousand
subscribers I was thinking of doing
maybe a Q&amp;amp;A video so if you're
interested in seeing that or maybe like
interested in me doing it just like this
video and I will definitely get one up
for you guys so yeah I hope you guys
enjoy this little foundation routine and
I don't see you on the next video okay
so first thing that we're taking is this
L'Oreal studio secrets professional
magic perfecting base now I don't
recommend this for oily skin in the
summertime but what I'm gonna do because
I'm usually if I'm doing this foundation
I'm going out or something
I just like to prime right here on my
pores a little bit right here and on my
chin I just like to do those areas I
don't like to do my whole face so I'm
just going to take a little bit like
that and just dot it right where I need
it
just like I'm just gonna rub it in I
don't really feel the need I'm priming
my whole face it's just not something I
do every day so and I did just wake up
so that's why I look a hot mess okay so
where's my foot okay we're gonna clip
our hair back
gotta have bags today what is going on
it's not cute so like I said I am taking
the NARS sheer matte foundation and I'm
just going to shake it up a bit and if
you're wondering I'm in color medium
dark
I finally got dark enough to use this so
I'm so excited and the brush we're gonna
be using is the one I always use which
is my Sonia Kashuk all over purpose
brushes when I think they call it I
think it's perfect on nation brush okay
so I'm putting some another foundation
on the back of my hand and just gonna
take that brush and stipple it in the
film nation I'm gonna need more good I'm
just gonna put this all over my face
I love this foundation I'm so happy I am
dark enough to wear now like I love it
so much
I love this for oily skin it's just
amazing and how the finishes and how it
dries it is just so amazing so I really
recommend as I always had ever since I
started my channel you guys know that I
said oh my god go try this out
because I thought I had to get like my
dry shampoo is like showing because of
you guys watch i've been raving about
but I'm like I don't have a Sephora
where I go get another color because it
I was too light for it like I've never
been pale but you know not skin just
spring this summer and kinda get darker
I was gonna go get a new color but dude
some that to me so I'm so excited I love
this foundation okay okay so that's the
foundation part now we're just gonna
take kind of a light concealer I don't
like to use too heavy of a concealer and
lately I've been liking the Maybelline
instant age rewind one in honey and I
will be doing an everyday face routine
like when I don't wear foundation which
is pretty much every day but right now
I'm doing the foundation one because I'm
so excited that I matched and I'm just
gonna take it and put some of it right
under my eyes like so use my finger to
kind of Pat it in and make sure it
blends really well and we do believe
honey is the darkest color so I really
like this stuff it's super light and it
feels so good like it's the easiest
thing to blend out ever and it's just I
love it
my hair is looking crazy I'm sorry go
lower okay
now normally I am in the summertime I
would set this on my NARS Mountain
powder but I'm out of it so I won't be
setting it with that I'll be doing a
different one out she's got a Mac one
but first I'm gonna take the eyes lips
face which is Alf translucent powder and
I'm just going to set my concealer real
quick because if you know I do that all
the time and if you have like oily skin
it's really good to set it just so
nothing moves this concealer doesn't
really move anyway but you never know so
just always good to set it okay so next
we're gonna take a powder I'm just gonna
take my Mac select sheer pressed powder
it means this of time lately I did use
this last summer as well as well as my
caralyn powder that I have I'm gonna use
this and I'm gonna take a kabuki instead
of a really dense brush because this
foundation is a full coverage foundation
so I don't want to add too much coverage
but I do want to side okay so like I
said I'm going to take this and my
kabuki just swirl it in there and buff
it all over my skin
like so okay that's that um and this
foundation also is really good at
covering redness so I don't even have to
cover my redness all right and you'll
see how I do that when I do my everyday
like daily face routine but I'm gonna go
ahead and put a blush on hard candy box
in a box and spicy and sweet absolutely
love this blush I always have it's a
great drugstore blush and just going to
put that on the apples of my cheeks
I know I'm like weirdest faces when I do
stuff like this so like that I love that
blush and then I'm just gonna take
hiding from benefit and I'm just going
to put this right on the top my
cheekbones so I'm going to do three
little dots and going up I'm just going
to kind of Pat and rub it
just to give a little glow right there
so I like to have this just to kind of
make me alive okay so that's pretty much
it it's super easy and I love this
foundation if you want to you could set
it with a setting spray during the
spring and summer I don't really do that
but if you want to you can it's totally
optional but I hope you guys enjoyed
this little foundation routine I'm super
sad I got to do it for you and I will
see you on an excu</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
