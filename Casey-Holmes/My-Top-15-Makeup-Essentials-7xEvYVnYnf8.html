top 15 makeup products I could not live
without if I pretty much had to get rid
of all my makeup these are the
essentials that I would keep because I'm
absolutely in love with it and it always
turned back to these products no matter
what I'm I think they're totally worth
the money some of them are drugstore
some of them are high-end but I'm
completely in love with them let me know
down below in the comments what your top
15 makeup products are that you could
not live without I think it'd be
interesting to see what everybody thinks
and like what everybody's favorite
makeup product is and if you make a
video like saying what your top 15 are
please leave it as a video response as
well or if you kind of have a video
that's similar just leave a video
response and yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this little video and I won't
see you looking at so I'm just gonna
randomly pull out things this is in no
particular order because they all mean
so much to me I love this stuff
obviously it doesn't fit but you know
whatever so I'm gonna plot the first
thing which is obviously my Mac select
sheer pressed powder I really like this
stuff I just keep going back to it and
keep going back to it and it's just
amazing so and in this I'm in NW 35 the
next thing is a bronzer and this is my
Norris Cassino bronzer I really love
this stuff I think it has like amazing
color payoff and the color is just
really great just a contour or a bronze
your whole face with you can do so many
things with it and I really love it it's
not completely matte has a tad bit of
shimmer in it but you can't really tell
it all so I love that the next thing I
think if I ever got rid of anything I
just want to keep a pair of nice
dramatic false lashes and for that I
choose the cherry blossom hundred ones
this is what they look like these are on
ms at Lancome for I think like 2 or 3
bucks
they're super duper cheap I really love
them and they're just super thick and
wispy and if I had to keep any in my
collection the Savita next thing is a
concealer quad and I decided on the
Sonia Kashuk and agenda one I just
absolutely love it because you have two
concealers right here that you can make
to match to match your color a really
nice green corrector and then you have
the transparent powder I think it's just
amazing on the go and this is also
called the hidden agenda concealer if
you were wondering so next thing is
matte carbon it was in all of my
favorite videos and then I was like
people probably get tired of this so I
quit fit it in there but I loved it so
much this is just the color of course
it's just a nice matte black and it says
carbon on the back so again that is one
of my all-time favorite blacks
I have never found one I love more than
this so I really love it next is an
eyelash curler this is a Revlon kind
it's not the best but whatever I feel
like I need an eyelash curler no matter
what um like right now I shouldn't need
to be kind of lifted but like my
eyelashes are so long and sometimes when
I put my skerin step on them they kind
of droop down so I feel like I always
need these bad boys in my life so I
really love those so next is a hard
candy box in a box blush and this isn't
spicy and sweet I've had this for a
while now and it's totally one of my
all-time favorite blushes even more than
some of my Mac blushes I just tend to go
back to this a lot more and let me
swatch it for you
it is just the perfect color I go I love
it so much so that's it right there
it is so thinking pretty I'm absolutely
in love with it next is a liquid
eyeliner this is the NYC liquid liner
and some people like I when I first got
this I was like what is so different
about this and I figured it out this
part is so much longer than like other
liquid liners like my Kat Von D one most
liquid liners are about this long on the
handle but as you can see the NYC one's
a lot longer so I kind of had to get
used to that in the beginning but oh my
gosh I'm in love with it
applicator - it's absolutely amazing let
me just show you a swatch it is so black
so that's that it's really great stays
on all day so when you get the hang of
it this is an amazing amazing eyeliner
next thing is something I also like
religiously talk about because I use it
every single day and I've had this for
over a year now so I highly recommend it
it's Mac's Paint Pot and this is in soft
ochre so it just looks like this is a
really nice eye primer it's lighter than
painterly but I like it I like it a lot
so this is been my all-time favorite one
when I go pick up a new one I don't know
if I'm gonna pick up this one again our
painterly but I might just pick up this
one cuz I know that I really love it but
that's a swatch of it right there you
can see that it's really really light
the next thing is an eyeliner pencil so
this pencil eyeliner is max eye Kohl for
AI : smolder I've had this for a while
now and I still have a lot of product to
go through I think this is an amazing
liner it is so pigmented super nice I
use it every single day definitely one
of my top 10 favorites I do not use
drugstore ones because they smear like
really bad on my waterline the only one
that doesn't is being wet and wild one
but it's not as creamy as like the Matt
Cole and but I'm not saying like at
drugstores the only ones that run
because this Estee Lauder Double Wear
one run so bad under my eyes is just
ridiculous but this is seriously the
only one I found that I really love and
the Makeup Forever aqua eyes one in
black that one's amazing as well but I
really love this let me show you guys my
it's so tiny look at it it's a baby so
yeah I use the heck out of that ok
anyways moving on my favorite foundation
of course the NARS your matte foundation
I've recommended this so many times I'm
absolutely in love with it if you are
have oily skin this is definitely one
I recommend to go try I really want to
try the matte velvet plus I've heard
really great things about that as well
but this is the only one I've
experienced and I really really truly
love it and I also have a foundation
routine on it which I will link down
below for you guys next is a clear brow
gel and this is for Maybelline and it's
just the great lash I really love this
cuz it's just nice to kind of lightly
throw on your brows to keep them tamed
because if you have eyebrows like mine I
inherited my dad's eyebrow so they're
super course I'm like really thick so I
have to be very careful the morale
because they will be going like crazy
okay two more products and then we're
done with the 15 so this one I highly
recommend this is a Jimmy cave catwalk
eye kit palette this is um you can get
this at Target
how pretty are these shadows I use them
today and I absolutely love them of
course I used carbon is my black but I
literally could live off this palette
and Pat carbon if I had to I just I'm
absolutely in love with them let me
swatch a couple shades for you
they're super pigmented so pretty I'm
just in love this is just five of them
but those are them I also have a review
on this palette so I will link it down
below but I think this is amazing for if
you're just getting started or something
I don't personally use the primer
because it's a little too creamy but you
have an eye primer to highlights and six
shadows so I think it's awesome for $26
I really really really love it then the
last thing is my all-time favorite
lipstick this is a Revlon's soft nude
and I am so in love with this one that's
what it looks like it is so creamy and
just like perfect it's the perfect
perfect nude I don't have to top it with
like a lip gloss I don't have to do any
of that it's just an amazing lipstick
that I'm absolutely in love with but
it's really hard for me to find
lipsticks that I really love and this is
definitely my favorite one I feel so
confident when I wear it I don't feel
like I'm dead or anything like that
um I hope you guys enjoyed this and I
will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
