on my top three bronzers I have one
that's really high-end one that's still
high-end but not as much and then I also
have a drugstore bronzer to show you
guys so I'm very excited these are the
three that I've been using a lot for the
past few months
and there's just definitely my top 3 I
love them so much I've mentioned them in
favorites and all that so I'm going to
go ahead and get started I'm going to
start with the most expensive one and
that is the Chanel salute and a Chanel
bronzer that's what it looks like from
the back just looks like this just with
this Chanel stuff on it I love this it
is a cream bronzer but I've said this
like a bazillion times it's kind of like
a cream to powder bronzer it's really
really great um especially if you have
oily skin I never use cream like blushes
or anything like that this is just a
whole different cream it just I don't
know it's really weird so I'll show you
which one it is
this is these Sanel one right here as
the swatch of it and it kind of has an
orange tint to it but it's not like
crazy this is the most natural looking
bronzer I own especially when you just
apply it to your cheeks it's just
amazing so the brush that I use with it
and this one I also use like a little
flat foundation brush but that's what I
really want to take time with my bronzer
but if I'm just doing it everyday then
this is the brush I use this is the c-45
contour brush it's just a regular angled
brush you can use whichever one you want
this is the one that I've been using
just for the bronzer so I literally just
swirl it in the product tap off the
excess on the lid which is why it is so
dirty and then I'll apply it right where
I would put my contour shade and just
buff it in and I go and take it off my
temples and of course underneath my
jawline and it literally just looks
amazing like I said it's super natural
looking like it just looks like you have
a natural shading to your face I love it
one my favorites I think this was like
fifty dollars but it's so worth it you
guys I love it so much so the next
bronzer is high-end but it's not as
expensive I think these are about twenty
seven dollars let me know if I'm wrong
but I think it's about twenty seven but
it is the mac mineralize skinfinish the
doesn't give me Sun I love this this is
a second math product that I ever
purchased and it's been about over a
year and a half it's probably got almost
two years since I've had this and I love
it so much so I'm gonna find that there
this is what that bronzer looks like
it's really nice this is an all matte
bronzer and so is this Chanel one by the
way I'm going to say that this is
completely matte and it's just so
freaking beautiful and the brush I use
for this is the Sigma duo fiber brush
you can use any drove by duo fiber brush
that you prefer I just personally like
using the duo fiber brushes with this
bronzer because if they don't pick up
too much product so when you apply it to
your face it's not like oh my god a
streak of orange and if you're wondering
this one right here is the Mac one so it
does have more of an orange tint to it
but I promise when you apply it on your
skin it just it looks really nice and
bronzed and just so freakin gorgeous I
think I've done a video showing you guys
how I apply this where I just swirl it
and put it on my cheeks underneath my
jaw and I'll top my temples but I can't
remember if I think I have so I'll try
and see if I can find that video so the
next one is drugstores it's definitely
my favorite it is the elf contouring
blush and bronzing powder I do like the
blush by the way if you're a lighter
skin tone I think you might like that
too but anyways it's about the bronzer
so that's what it looks like I don't
know if you can see but I definitely put
a dent in this I've actually been using
this a lot this month too it's really
awesome I decided just to pull it out
again and I've been loving him
this is and blush in bronze so this is
the original one that they came out with
I know they have more colors now but
this is just the original one that they
had and the brush I use with it is this
Sedona like FBO 3 which is just like a
tulip brush and I'll just tap it into
the bronzer tap off any excess and then
I'll just put it right where I put my
contour just buff it in and if you're
wondering this one is the elf bronzer
it's more of a brown color so you have
to be very careful with it because you
don't want to look too muddy but it's
perfect I love it if you have darker
skin tone you would really like this too
lighter skin tone just use a light hand
with it and I think you'll love it as
well so those are my top three bronzers
I hope you
enjoyed it let me know what your top
bronzer is in the comments below I would
love to hear maybe go try out some new
ones so thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you all in my
next video my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
