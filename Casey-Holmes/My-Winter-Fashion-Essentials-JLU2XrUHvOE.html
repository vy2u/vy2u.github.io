my winter fashion essentials in this
stuff you have seen all me some of the
stuff you've seen pretty similar Styles
so I just love these items and they're
definitely a must-have so I'm gonna
start off with just like the main thing
that I'm obsessed with for this fall and
winter and it is crop sweater so I'm not
talking about crop sweaters are like
cropped like underneath your boob I
don't like that I like the crop sweaters
that just show a little bit of your
tummy like you kind of raise your arm a
little bit and stuff I think those are
super cute and you can find those pretty
much anywhere and this one is my first
one I love it got this one in another
color and cream which I wore in a couple
videos ago but I love this one it has
like a zip detail right here and it's
from the brand rubbish but you can see
it's just not too cropped but it is a
crop sweater like it's not as long as
the other ones so I really like that one
and then H&amp;amp;M has amazing ones as well I
love H&amp;amp;M in forever 21 but I usually
gravitate towards hmmm I actually got a
bunch of these because they have them in
a ton of different colors in stores I
don't know if they're online but I
definitely saw them in stores and this
is just one of the colors I got and then
they have you know regular plain colors
and in the last crop sweater I want to
show you is one that just came in and
I'm obsessed with it it's from forever
21 and it's really thick and I love that
so I'm not like freezing my butt off
when I'm wearing this and this is just
what it looks like cute little crop
sweater it's just so nice and thick I
like it I like it
so another winter essential for me is
high-waisted colored or printed denim
and I love high waisted I don't like
them too high waisted but I like them
high waisted enough so I cry my crop
sweaters with them and these ones are a
forest green color and they're from H&amp;amp;M
they're so nice they fit really well and
I just I love H&amp;amp;M for pants I think they
have amazing amazing pants and great
deals as well and I'm actually wearing
the other pair of like acid-washed pants
up in picture right here but I love as
they've washed looking pants
next is pleather detailed leggings I got
from Nordstrom as well they just came in
and excused them because I wore them
sledder and like the stuff got all over
it but these are so cute I think they're
from the juniors line just like little
pleather details are so cute I have so
many leggings with pleather details that
I cannot get enough of them and I'm
always buying more just because I love
them and there's so many different
patterns out there next is chunky knit
cardigans and I think these are so cute
especially paired with like a tiger
shirt underneath and like a chunky scarf
and some leggings and boots it's like a
go-to outfit this knit I actually got
from H&amp;amp;M what do you know and it's
really really thick and it just looks
like this it's a really really thick one
I have like a little side panel I did
try this on for you it's really really
cute and it's just so chunky and I love
it so much it has like the little tassel
thingies all around it and this baby was
a great Buy and it's so so warm and like
I mentioned chunky scars are a huge
thing for me this year I used to never
be into chunky scarves but now I really
am and this one is one of my favorites
it's kind of camel color this is from
H&amp;amp;M again of course and I love it
because it was like I think 8 to 13
dollars and it's just so nice it keeps
you so warm I have a ton of these like
infinity scarves and then I also have
ones that sit up around the neck too so
I love these next is like statement
combat boots I have two that I'm
obsessed with and these first pair are
from Haute look and they have like this
studded wrap detail around the bottom so
you guys know I love my combat boots so
these were a must-have and it just looks
so cute so again I got these off of
hautelook and then these pair I featured
on my blog and they're from guess and
this is what they look like
these are definitely statement boots and
I'm obsessed with them they have this
little gold plate at the front like gold
teeth detail on the front I just love
these some people really despise them
but I love them and then last is just
really cute booties these first ones are
from BCBG I got these on sale at
Nordstrom and they're having their
all annual self something for friends
and family this is what they look like
they're like a topi gray color and
they're chunky I love movies you guys
know this I've been featuring them in my
favorites videos a lot lately but these
are a newfound favorite and they're so
cute right I love them and these booties
as well wish a happy turn on my blog
these are from buck Oh got these awful
look as well I love the detail on the
ends of the booties I'm always looking
for different details on boots just
because I have so many that I kind of
want some that stand out from each other
so I can't show you guys winter
essentials without showing you some
coats the first one is when I showed you
guys before in one of my favorites
videos this is from H&amp;amp;M it's just a
fur-lined jacket right here with fur on
the hood and it's a padded jacket so
it's really really warm it's pretty
heavy-duty and I like it a lot it's just
so cute and it's been keeping me nice
and warm so far throughout this cold
weather so I am obsessed with this
actually got it in the gray color as
well and then for me every winter I have
to have like some sort of pleather
jacket and this one is the one that I've
been wearing so far this year I could
definitely go without the pink lining I
think the pink lining is a little not
too cute but the style of it and the way
it's shaped I just adore this jacket and
it was really affordable I got it from
love culture and I got it a while back
so they might still have it but I'm not
sure but this is definitely an essential
for me because I feel like these jackets
can go with pretty much anything and the
last must-have for me is definitely a
nice structured bag and I've seen
structured bags everywhere but the more
on the high-end side like Prada da Vinci
I think as I say did you say da Vinci
Jib jebal she I don't know I went with
this one and I'm really happy with it
and it is from a Michael Kors
I don't remember the exact name but I
will list it down below and I adore this
bag is so gorgeous and it's just made so
well and I love the shape of it it keeps
its shape too and it has a strap so you
can put on your shoulder or doing a
crossbody and I really feel like this
purse is not going to go out and style
just because it's like a timeless bag
I adore it so that is it for my winter
fashion
