with you my January favorites and I'm
really excited because I found so many
new things this month that I love and I
have some drug stores some high-end I
just have a lot to share with you so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
do like this video don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe to my
channel but I hope you guys enjoy it if
you want to see all my favorites for
this month then let's just get started
okay so the first thing I want to show
you guys is something actually when I
demonstrate cuz I need to blog right now
but this is the rest paper from Palladio
I believe it's very sad I always get it
wrong but it's an all absorbing blotting
tissues with rice powder this has rice
powder on it on one of the sides of the
sheets you can blow it with any side but
I always blot with the matte side which
has the rice powder on it you basically
Balat away all the oil and everything it
also adds a little bit of powder to your
face so you don't have to add extra
powder on top and extra layers and it's
literally amazing it's amazing so let me
show you because I need to do it right
now they just come out like this okay
alright that was that and I like to take
this side instead of this side and I
will just blot my face with it now when
you first look at your sheet you're like
oh my god you're like it's taking off
all my makeup but it's really not not at
all but look I know it's gross but
you're oily like me and you don't
necessarily always want to put more
powder on top I think these are perfect
for you and what's great about these is
they're drugstores so you could find
these at Ulta it's not too sure where
else they're sold but I know for sure
they're sold at Ulta and look at that
like it looks like it's taking off a lot
of your makeup but it's really not at
all it's just taking up all the excess
oil and I feel like it's taking up
excess makeup as well so I love these I
carry these around with me everywhere
because they are my absolute favorite
and I feel like they have really nice
packaging as well and really quickly I
want to talk about some skincare
products that I have been loving as well
first is the NARS skin total
replenishing eye cream I love this for
day-to-day use I always keep it at my
vanity so before I pull makeup I could
put on some more eye cream just so it's
really nice and hydrated but I like it
because it's kind of a cooling sensation
and it really does kind of minimize
the look of my fine lines and I also
love the packaging of this I just think
it's so sleek and pretty I honestly
didn't have too high of hopes for this
because I've never tried in our skincare
but this is actually really really great
and perfect for daytime and then another
product that I love for daytime and
nighttime is this benefit total moisture
facial cream this stuff is phenomenal I
have oily skin but after I wash my face
sometimes with different products my
face will feel really really dry and I
do not like that feeling at all
and when your skin feels dry like that
it's not good for your skin because your
skin is gonna be like oh hey I need to
produce more oil because this probably
got none and you're like uh yes I do
and then just produces more oil and it
gets on your nerves and it just looks
like a hot mess I struggle with it all
the time but honestly ever since I've
been using this it is just it hydrates
my skin enough to the point where I
don't get as oily throughout the day and
this is a pretty thick cream when you
put it on you're like oh man I should
have used this for nighttime but as long
as you let it set into your skin and
really sink in it's just gonna sink in
perfectly you're not gonna have any
residue on your face it will all sink in
I promise you even if you have oily skin
this stuff is so good and you get a ton
of product in this and the little quark
top is just the cutest okay another
thing from benefit that I discovered
this month I have been in love with I'm
going to need this in stock like I'm
gonna need this in bulk because I'm
obsessed and I love it so much it is the
benefit Porefessional Mac rescue now I
first got this it did have like a little
bit of instructions and it has like a
little bit on the back but you don't
necessarily know exactly what to do with
it unless you're told
unless you know they post an Instagram
post and I watched it and I finally
figured out how to correctly use it but
you use it after you moisturize them
everything and before your primers and
this is great because it is a gel so
since it's gel it's gonna sink into the
skin really quickly and easily it's not
gonna leave behind any residue on your
skin but this makes my skin feel so soft
and it really does blur out some of my
pores and this with the Marc Jacobs
foundation is heavenly since I put this
all over my face my whole face is smooth
and
it's ready to go and then I do add my
primers on top which are the ones I use
from Smashbox all the time and once I
put my foundation on I swear my
foundation has never looked better it
just looks so smooth and it really
glides on and my skin feels very
hydrated and the oil has really calmed
down and it doesn't produce as much so a
couple more skin products and then we'll
move on the makeup I have been loving
this Josie Maran whipped argan oil ultra
hydrating body butter this is the
unscented kind I've wanted to try this
for so long but I did not like this
sense that she had I'm I'm just really
picky and I didn't like them I know a
lot of people do love her sense but I'm
just a picky broad so I didn't like any
of them but once I found out she had an
unscented one like I couldn't find it on
Sephora calm but I found this on QVC I
purchased it immediately and I love it
it's perfect for daytime and moisturize
is enough and it sinks in just enough to
put your clothes on and it not be like
slippery or anything throughout the day
but you feel so moisturized and I know
that this is a great body butter because
I can feel it the next day like my skin
is still really really moisturized and I
haven't been struggling with really
itchy legs or anything like that since
I've been on this and it is very
lightweight and it is unscented but it's
not a weird unscented smell I know that
sounds a little crazy but you know how
some things they're unscented but they
smell a little weird that is not this at
all you can't smell it and you could put
your perfume on top whatever perfume you
want and it's perfect so I highly
recommend this again I got mine off of
QVC last thing is for self tanning and
I've been wanting to try this for a
while accepting like Carly and the Cole
mention this and it is the tan and the
raw ultra dried body shimmer first off
you could use this pertaining but you
could also use it like if you're going
out and just want a dusting of shimmer
on top of your shoulders which is what I
like to use it for sometimes as well but
this is really great once I self tan and
I'll let it dry for a few minutes I will
put this in the creases of my arm I have
a hard time with this part right here
creasing and the color kind of rubbing
around and looking a little weird and it
dries it and it makes it look so amazing
and this stuff smells good I don't know
if anybody's ever said that this stuff
smells good to me like I love it and I
thought it was gonna be really messy but
mine's not that messy at all I mean you
can see there's just a little bit
in there and a little bit on the puff
but mine doesn't get really messy like I
thought it would so and we definitely
check this out if you love self-tanning
and you're just having a hard time with
like the creases of your body looking a
little weird definitely get this because
it will really help with that and it
still gives you a little shimmer as well
so I love this and I got mine off of
Amazon where do we even start with
makeup like I don't even know there's so
much I have to mention okay so let's
start out with drugstore stuff first
okay so first I'm going to talk about
foundations from the drugstore that I
have been loving this one is the
Maybelline Dream velvet soft matte
hydrating foundation actually did a
video demoing this to show you guys how
I like to apply it personally I like to
apply it with a brush some people like
to apply it with a Beauty Blender and
whatnot but I am a brush girl with this
I feel like it really blends into my
skin and really covers my rosacea a lot
better that way these are great they
last a long time on my skin and they
look really really beautiful on the skin
they have a nice velvet finish it's not
like super matte or anything like that
but it's a nice velvet finish and it
does hydrate the skin and it really like
just glides over your pores and fine
lines I love this I think this is like
one of my top favorite foundations that
the drugstores come out with and it's
gonna be hella hard to top this for me
the last one is this L'Oreal Lumi
cushion I honestly didn't think I was
gonna like this because I don't like the
L'Oreal Lumi foundations of course I've
oily skin so those on me they kind of
just look a little greasy within like a
few minutes honestly but this I really
love I didn't know how I would feel
really about the cushion foundations but
I like it like that it's compact I like
that it's easy to work with I just
dipped my Beauty Blender in here and put
on my face I know some people like to
use this sponge that comes with it I
personally don't I like to use a Beauty
Blender but it's all about personal
preference you can use whatever you have
and yeah I really really love this like
it looks so beautiful and hydrating on
the skin I again did a video on this as
well so I'll leave that down below if
you want to see it in action and what it
looks like on oily skin and covering my
rosacea
it's a luminous foundation but it's not
so luminous that you have to worry about
looking super oily like I do
this with a powder which I want to
mention the maybelline powder came out
but I can't find it right now I think
it's in one of my clutches I'm obsessed
with that new Maybelline translucent
powder but I'll set this with that and
it just looks beautiful throughout the
day and it just makes me look really
healthy and glowy now I don't know if
I'll be able to use this in the
summertime because they'll be hot I'm
sweaty and all that but so far for the
winter time I'm loving it ok for
concealers from the drugstore I'm kind
of late on this bandwagon but this is
the Maybelline but this is the
Maybelline master conceal concealer and
I got the shade light/medium 30 I love
this this has really great coverage and
to me this could be comparable to a
high-end concealer like it is awesome
kind of reminds me of mac prolongwear in
a way I really like it it blends out
very easily and it lasts all day long so
I absolutely love this and then either
one I've been loving is this wet and
wild highlighting and concealing pen I
think this looks so amazing underneath
the eyes it like looks refreshing and it
looks bright and pretty I love this and
I'm like almost done with it and then
the last concealer I've tried is the
Stila aqua go ciarán concealer and
white medium as well I love this so much
it just looked so beautiful this would
be Marc Jacobs foundation as well
because I've been using the Marc Jacobs
one and like I haven't used this with
the drugstore products I only use this
with high end but this with the Marc
Jacobs foundation is beautiful it looks
refreshing it doesn't crease and it just
stays on all day like I applied this at
11 o'clock in the morning when I was in
New York one day and it lasts until 5
o'clock in the morning yeah because we
went out to a club and we were having
fun so this lasted all day and I love it
and it is more of a squeezy tube which i
think is great and it's just so easy to
squeeze on the back of your hand okay so
the last drugstore product I want to
mention is this Ardell medium brown Paul
made for your brows guys I love this I
didn't use it today because I use
something else but I love this I have
been tearing this up it is so great I
think it's really easy to work with is
so cup size and it's so comparable to
the
Asya dipbrow in my opinion Anasazi it
does have more colors and just a better
selection in general but if you can find
your shade and these only have this one
which is the medium brown and I believe
a darker Brown but if you have your
shade in this definitely try it out
because I think it's amazing I love it I
think it lasts all day it looks great on
the brows I think it's great so
definitely check that out alright moving
on with high-end products and we will be
doing with this video the first one is
one that I actually did not have high
expectations for it is the hourglass
ambient strobe lighting powder and
euphoric strobe light and this is what
it looks like it's like their new
highlighters they came out with and they
also have a little blender to go with it
I've been using this blender dry you can
use it dry or wet but I love this
because it gives such a beautiful glow
to the skin it's not like BAM highlight
in your face in my personal opinion but
the glow that it gives is just gorgeous
so if you have oily skin and you use a
matte foundation but you still want a
gorgeous glow I would recommend
something like this because it is
stunning
I mean I have nothing bad to say about
this it looks so beautiful on top of
foundation I would put it on right now
but I have a different highlight on but
I love to just take this sponge dip it
in and kind of just brush it here and
down my nose and on top of my lip and
the glow it looks like you're wearing a
luminous foundation when you're not it's
done it okay this thing I just I think I
just showed it in a video not too long
ago um but I have been using this
non-stop ever since I got it it's the
charlotte tilbury face sculpt in
highlight and oh I've had this in my
basket on Nordstrom for like a year now
and I go back and forth with it I'm like
should I should I not know always like
took it out or whatever I finally bit
the bullet and got it and I am wearing
this thing out the highlight is so
beautiful it's so pigmented and the
sculpting powder is just stunning the
sculpting powder is more of an ashy tone
which I love and then this highlight
shade y'all oh my god oh it's so
beautiful I do have the contour on today
by far one of my favorite contours I
have worked with in a while
and I've been wearing this out to the
point where the letters are like rubbing
off so love this it lasts all day as
well and I also want to mention a new
brush i've been using the contour this
is the morphe 529 I like it because it's
smaller but it's really fluffy so it's
easy to get right in the contour line
because it is tapered so you get right
in the contour line and just blend it up
and it looks flawless so these two
together okay so two more products this
one is another newer one I don't know
what my Sephora haul will be up but you
will see this in my Sephora haul when it
goes up and it is the Kat Von D shade +
light blush and it's in the shade hansel
and gretel just got this I've been using
it every day since I got it and the idea
of this is you use the lighter shade and
one on the apples of your cheeks to the
middle and then you use a darker shade
here on the outer part of your cheeks
what I think is great about this though
is you have basically three different
blushes in one you can use this side
which is what I did today for a really
light blush you could use just this one
or you can mix it all together and get a
nice medium toned pink so I love this I
think this is a great idea I just wanted
to try out one before I tried out other
ones and I love the formula it blends
out really well and now I won't like all
the colors so this is a narcissist a
little more eye shadow palette I wore
this in my Sephora haul
I wore this shade right here and this
one this one I mean I love this town I'm
thinking of doing its oil on that look
that I had in the Sephora haul because I
loved it so much I think it's just it
was one of my favorites and I love this
green I just saw it's so pigmented so
creamy and this black is a dream to
blend out I would definitely recommend
checking this out of Sephora dipping
your fingers in it it is stunning and I
will be using this a lot more and I
still have my little film on this one
because I really don't like the look of
fingerprints on mirrors I had to take it
off this one the cheek palette which is
also really good but I haven't used it
enough so I didn't really mention it in
this video but those fingerprints okay
so those are all of my makeup products
for this month there were a ton but
honestly I love all of them and I'm so
happy I found new products because I was
kind of getting bored with what I was
using and I
all of them and also if you guys I
haven't done it yet I've had these two
just chillin back here the Maybelline
Dream blenders the foundation sponge I
will say I'm I heard great things about
it but if you want me to do a first
impression let me know in the comments

this foundation even though I know I
like to apply this with a brush I could
still you know try it out for you guys
