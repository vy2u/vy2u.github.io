spread your wings my little butterfly
don't let what they say keep you up at
night and they give you then they can
walk home ah I got my heart stony for
Mariah high heels on there's nothing I
could do I couldn't stop hey guys so I'm
going to be sharing with you my beauty
room tour I actually had my TV mounted
today which was like the final touch so
yeah these are the doubled awards that
lead into the Beauty room aka my little
piece of heaven and when you open them
up this is what it looks like but uh
it's pretty large this is from outside
the room this is actually a bonus room
in the house and this and the kitchen is
basically what sold me on the house and
the master bedroom pretty much
everything this house was I was just
completely sold so you walk in there's
one side and you also have this side
over here so I'm just going to take you
around the room and tell you about
storage and all that other kind of stuff
airsoft let's start over here this is
the jewelry chest I got from Pier one I
was really obsessed with Pier one when I
started moving so I got this chest
because I decided that I was getting a
lot of jewelry and I needed a place to
store it so up here I store like some
watches I have the rest of them
somewhere but pretty much like things I
use all the time and then in here you
know it's just jewelry stuff necklaces
things like that I just I needed a chest
for all this stuff so I decided to go
ahead and get one do my my outfit today
is my off day not filming any beauty
videos so I'm not trying to impress
anybody and then above it you guys have
seen this before if you've seen past
Beauty room tours this is a painting I
got from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond it was a
while back but I love it she's so cute
and it's just perfect for the beauty
room because she's put on her lipstick I
just love her and then this mirror right
here I love it but when I ordered it I
got it off of wayfair.com I thought it
was gonna be a lot bigger like the kind
where I didn't have to hang it up
I don't know I was a little disappointed
with how much smaller it was then when I
expected and I waited like three weeks
for this mirror so I do love it I think
it's elegant and pretty and if I ever
want to you know replace it later on
down the road with a bigger mirror I'm
definitely gonna keep this one we'll see
if I end up investing in a bigger mirror
I don't know but it is really pretty
with the corners being mirrored and
everything like that and then I get a
lot of questions about the paintings
that I have and most of them are from
HauteLook this one is also from
HauteLook I've had this for forever it
actually used to chill in my like master
bedroom in the apartment but now it's in
the BD room and I love it I think it's a
great pop of color because everything
else in here is pretty much white or
like a basic shade but this is like a
great pop of color look at me looking
I'm looking crazy girl don't look at me
okay so right when I was moving in this
place and I know I was going to have
this room I knew this chair is what I
wanted it was exactly what I wanted this
exact type of chair the shape everything
I just knew it was super cute and would
go great in this room and I love it for
the corner and I actually still miss
quite a bit a lot more than I expected
to be quite honest with you and I think
it's a great way to kind of fill this
space right here so this is from
overstock.com which was another
obsession of mine for a while and then I
got the pillow from look moving over
here these flowers add from t.j.maxx
forever now they used to be in my master
bedroom as well at the apartments but I
just put them in here for a pop of color
I probably will move this or sell it
just because I don't know they kind of I
don't know I just have a lot of flowers
going on this room that C is also from
TJ Maxx I love it I feel like I could
never find anything with my initial on
it this little thing again is from TJ
Maxx and I have a candle that I never
light and then I also have an extra
camera and then this little nightstand
thing I got from Target I absolutely
love it and it was such a great deal I
originally got this for the background
of my videos when I first moved in here
but now since I don't film with this in
the background I still love it and still
have it just because it stores you know
just random stuff so in here I have like
an extra candle and I have my camera's a
lens and then like my journals so I just
keep those in there I think it's a great
way to store
items and still look really cute and
it's white so I love this now for the
thing that everybody asked me about on
my Instagram and just pretty much
anything in general if you see it in
videos is my shoe shells these are all
from Ikea this one as well as these
three right here all from Ikea you could
put in shelves on IKEA comm you could go
into IKEA they always always always have
them so I know I have an excessive
amount of shoes but believe it or not
their majority of these all the time I'm
really a heel person I've grown to be a
heel girl and just wear them all the
time so don't worry these do get put to
use and if they don't ask Terina
I give them to friends so the little
white flowers up top right from Pier one
I loved it I put them together with the
vase and I just thought they were super
cute and yeah I just store all of my
heels up here and have a pair of teks
up there as well I love this it's a
great way to store shoes and just look
really cute and I don't know it fills up
space really really well so I absolutely
love this moving on over here we have
the place where I film in my videos so
you don't see this ever because this is
always behind the camera but I have all
my lights and then I have my vanity girl
mirror which is blew out is that how you
say it it blew a fuse or something and
it won't work anymore and I'm really sad
about it so have to buy a new one I love
this mirror highly recommend it changed
up the bulbs cuz I like natural lighting
bulbs but all my lights are from a BH
photo and video you can check them out
they were pricey but it's an investment
to make have multiples of these in the
room the little round ones just because
this room is so big that if I don't put
at least like one over here in one
facing this way it'll be too dark in the
background have them kind of spread out
through the room and I really like it I
did have lipstick holders here but I
move them over there just because it was
being like too crammed over here I was
going crazy so this little clear cube
thing I got from eBay I believe I don't
remember the seller or anything it was a
while back but this thing opens up and
that's where I keep all my primers and
here I keep eyebrows eyelashes anything
to do with that sort eyeliners
and then I have my eye brushes face
brushes and then most used palettes so I
have some morphe ones in here my lorac
palettes make up forever shadows in here
and then I also have or makeup geek
morphe stuff in here as well so just
stuff I use more often I keep right here
just so they're nice and handy and easy
to get also all this furniture - this
this is actually from HauteLook as well
all this furniture the alex shores
everything is from ikea ikea is the best
place to get furniture it sucks because
you have to put it together but i mean
honestly the price is not bad at all so
that's why I love IPM on the top here we
just have some necessities I got the
makeup brush holder from Target and I
got this little guy from Marshalls they
always have them so check them out if
you're interested they it's just they
always have them there and for those
asking how I make this my monitor it's
just something I youtube it took me
forever to figure it out like I had to
go back to Best Buy probably three times
so I can't necessarily tell you how to
do it but if you youtube videos they'll
show you how to do all that over here I
have my hot iron holster I have my hot
iron a holster and I like to put this
right here just for my curling iron so
it doesn't burn anything and I love this
if you just Google hot iron host holster
I say it then a lot will pop up like I
said this little drawer here is from
Ikea one here I just have hair products
beauty blenders tape Bobby and then same
for here just random hair stuff
neosporin deodorant you know just random
door I have an extensions drawer and
like combs and stuff like that I also
have curling irons in these next two
drawers and I also have some storage
stuff back there as well if I need them
so curling irons and then just some more
curling irons a variety I did give a lot
of this stuff away when I moved and
that's pretty much what I have left ok
moving over here I got these two signs
from I think it was TJ Maxx from
Marshalls it was one of those stores but
I've had these for a while and I really
love them
have great messages so I just like to
put them above here cuz I just like the
way it fills up the space okay so over
here I have these little lipstick
holders and see like I like them but my
stuff tends to fall out so sometimes it
gets pretty annoying if you're just like
a nitpicker like I am with stuff like
that especially if they're more pricey
then it will probably bother you and I
also have another one over here and then
these little trays I have my parkings on
are from TJ Maxx I like this is their
clear and that they hold them all in
place and I know I have the tag on it
too so how cute is that pattern I mean
nobody ever sees it but hey you know
what it's there
alright now getting on to the fun stuff
it is makeup now when I moved I went
through all of my makeup and I really
got rid of a lot of things gave away a
ton of it and I threw away so much
makeup it's insane how much makeup I
threw away but it was either expired I
did want to get to my friends because it
was horrible so this is the first drawer
this is just like single eyeshadows
pigments and things like that and then I
also have this little container I got
all of these dividers I know I have some
tags on everything but they're such a
pain to get off but I got these little
clear dividers from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond in
the kitchen section they have a ton of
them ton of different sizes and they fit
really nicely here in these drawers
again this is from Ikea the furniture so
I have stuff over here that I've had it
opened and just things that I don't
necessarily want to use yet so I have
backups and stuff and then like I said I
just have different eyeshadows from Mac
I have mixing liquid liners okay so this
short is a little excessive but I'm a
huge foundation person so yeah it's
gonna be a little excessive I have all
my foundations in here I just want to
quickly say too that my makeup drawers
are not very organized I mean they're
organized if we're talking categories
but they're not organized like looking
really pretty or anything these are all
my foundations I have gone through them
I have some
over here that have not been opened and
then I need to play with but for the
most part all of these have been used a
few times and I do like them which is
the reason why I still have them moving
on to another favorite drawer is powders
again these are powders that I use and I
like or they are new and yeah pretty
pretty bare minimum it's really basic
and simple I don't have anything
dividing them just because sometimes
whenever I step powders like this or on
top of each other and roars I tend to
forget about them so having them all
spread out really helps me use them more
this Shore's kind of excessive but again
these actually next couple drawers are a
little excessive but I love these
products so this one is my bronzer
drawer I have cream bronzers powder
bronzers I have my brother palettes in
here again these are things I have just
purchased or love and yeah I love I just
I love bronzers like I can't hold myself
so yeah these are all some of my
favorites I don't think I got rid of any
bronzers when I was moving I was like
hmm nope I'm gonna need it now blushes I
did kind of get rid of quite a bit if
you guys remember my old makeup
collection I had a ton of blushes but
now I kind of numbed it numbed it I kind
of dumbed it down I slowed my Mac
palettes because I absolutely adore
these blushes and then I have some
drugstore favorites and I still have my
high-end ones as well this drawer was a
lot more intense the last makeup
collection but like this side wouldn't
look this crazy if I hadn't organized
it's just everything's laid out but I
really don't have as many as I used to
moving we'll do that to you whenever you
move you're gonna be like oh my gosh
I need to get rid of everything because
it's gonna suck to pack and it all
definitely sucks but um yeah I kind of
narrowed it all down so now I can see
what I have and really use it and
nothing's expired and it last but not
least we have highlighters I again don't
have that many highlighters
these are just what I love I have a sock
in here how does your probably move that
I have some new things I got for
morphine so I have some brushes from
them and new palace as well so I'm just
waiting to play for those actually just
stuff those in there the other day
because I was doing a housewarming for
my family and it didn't have time to
organize them so I just decided to throw
them all in there and these by the way
this is two sets of these George stacked
on each other that's why they're so tall
okay so like the last drawer that
actually has stuff in it that you
probably care about this is my last
drawer actually just stocked up on
lashes because I needed some more but I
have like House of lashes in here red
cherry lashes which I never use anymore
just because they're not as full as I
want I usually have the lower lashes in
here but I've been using am I crazy
mosquito oh I forgot to have this little
pepper before ah I need to start using
this Topher and I had that but yeah just
a bunch of different brands I like to
try different things so that's in there
and then this drawer right here is up I
received from a company DeVaughn sent me
a bunch of stuff so I just kind of threw
it all in here and then I have some
stuff from the beautycon event because
they did give us a goodie bag so I just
kind of put all that in here because I
didn't want to overwhelm myself with
makeup when I got back so I just kind of
stuff them into this drawer just so I
could it could be outside on my bed
Oh even though I have this your oops not
even kidding you I totally forgot I had
this drawer full of stuff so now I'm
gonna have to reorganize because I need
to remember these products but I have a
bunch of palettes in here Stephanie
cosmetics old Mac palettes this palette
and Too Faced blush palette things that
I've received beige cosmetics because I
love them and have more morphe Urban
Decay save mom pay now moving on to this
corner of the room this TV just got
installed today that cord will bother me
I know it but I'm think I'm gonna have
somebody come through and drill a hole
and like hide those wires or something
us that's going to drive me insane when
I was moving I knew this room was going
to be bigger and I knew I wanted TV in
here because in my apartment I would be
watching Supercross or like football and
I would have to go do my makeup and I
didn't have the TV in my old makeup room
in my apartment so I knew when I read
bought a house since is where I was
going to be permanently I wanted to have
a little TV so I could just keep up with
sports I'm really big into Supercross
and also into football so I like to keep
up with things like that especially
football I go insane so that was one of
the things I did for this room and I'm
really happy I did it because I don't
know like this is I spend most of my
time up here and I kind of just want to
keep up on things hey I get a lot of
questions about this stand right here
that I have all my crossbodies on as you
can see it is white I got this from
Wayfarer comm as well and I love this
stand because it is white so goes along
with the rest of the furniture in the
room and it holds all of the crossbodies
that I have that's the newest addition I
know a lot of been asking about my new
Chanel but I don't really want to talk
about designer stuff on my channel
anymore because people get really upset
about it for those that have been seeing
it yes I do have a picture of it on
Instagram so you can go search Instagram
and see where it's at but um yeah this
is just where I keep everything and I
love it I'm a huge cross body person
just to go out a lot whether it's just
to hang out with friends or go out to
dinner and cross bodies or usually what
I go for or my nicer purses and I just
keep them on that so yeah I know some
people have like a nicer way of storing
their nice purses but for me this is
sufficient and as long as I have the
dust bag like for that one we're good to
go now this little guy right here was
something that I had to kind of
improvise and get so had so many cords
over here if you saw any my recent
Instagram posts that were like right
when I moved in I had a lot of cords
over here I wanted something like this
so I could like put my TV stuff on and
put extra things in there that I don't
use all the time I got this from Target
as well so if you're looking for
something like a shoe shelf but just a
little bit smaller they have these at
Target and I think they're a pretty
great deal I can't remember off the top
of my head but I know was it that
expensive and I did
together myself and it wasn't that bad
to put together so definitely check out
target if you want something smaller
okay so again I do have these three-tier
things right here these are different
shelves than the one that's right behind
me because they are three separate
things so this is 1 this is 1 and this
is 1 this again just where I put my
shoes and it's all from Ikea I also
again got this sign from hook hello it
just has really cute stuff like this and
I thought it would be perfect I actually
purchased this before I moved and I was
like oh my gosh yes Beauty room is going
to need it in its life so that is the
beauty room tour I hope you guys enjoyed
this video it was highly requested and
I've been working on this room ever
since I moved in here so I really hope
you enjoyed it I hope if you are moving
or you have a place that this gave you
some storage ideas or even just some
ideas of where to shop in general and
yeah I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
