going to be trying out some new Catrice
products I actually just got all this
stuff in the mail so I'm really excited
to test it out I'm going to show you
like a little quick a pan of everything
that I have here primer is a really cool
face palette and highlighting eyeshadow
never heard that before but we're gonna
test out we have some eye shadow
palettes blushes lip products we've got
a lot we're just gonna try all this
stuff out today I do have my hair in a
bun because I did not feel like doing my
hair today and you probably see a stripe
of dry shampoo didn't feel like doing my
hair today so a fun bun it is we're
gonna keep it up there because I just
don't patience to do it today so you
guys don't want to see me play around
with this stuff then definitely keep
watching and don't forget to subscribe
before you leave if you're not
subscribed already and if you want to
see how these products work out then
let's just go ahead and get started so
just cleaning my makeup table today
it's like appropriate enough to scan for
you guys know normally I wouldn't show
you my makeup table because it's usually
filled because I'm lazy and like don't
put things away but today I did and it
was because davis and i were gonna film
a video together so i want to have it
clean for him and just clean for my mind
you know what it means also i don't know
when this video's going up it's
definitely going up maybe sunday I don't
know but we're going to Montreal this
weekend I'm gonna be vlogging so if you
want to check out the vlogs go check out
my vlog channel can't tell you and
they'll be up but we're definitely
vlogging like I just told you guys I
just got all this stuff in the mail so
I'm really excited we don't have like a
full face but I figured we had a lot of
stuff here that we could go ahead and
just try out so that is what we will do
right now first thing for eyes I'm gonna
take the prime and fine brightening
eyeshadow primer I've never tried this
before so hopefully it's good I really
like the packaging I think it's cute so
it's a brightening primer also if you're
wondering where am I so what sweaters
from its from wealthbox wooh this feels
kind of like a cream to powder type
thing it reminds me of the Smashbox
primer so far just the way it feels it
is looking a little splotchy but maybe
whenever we go in with an eyeshadow and
set it it'll be okay but it's not very
green
see or anything like that it kind of
feels I don't know it feels really nice
the pilots that I have today we have the
modern matte collection which looks like
more cool tone shades all of these
palettes do not look too promising I'm
gonna be dead on it's just because
they're all pretty light shades and
there's not too much like I don't know
there's not too much to work with here
they all just look very light they look
like it when I put them on my eyes they
will look like the same kind of shade
but we will test it out because that's
what we're here to do I'm going to use
the modern mattes first and I'm gonna go
in with this shade right here I don't
really want to take this white so I'll
go in with this one I'm gonna set this
eyeshadow base it's a pretty nice base
we got going there I definitely think
you have to layer up the shadow to make
the base look seamless maybe with all
the other eyeshadows we put on you won't
be able to tell that's a little bit
patchy really quickly I'm gonna read
what these are these are new and they're
the aquafresh highlighting eye shadows
we have luminous and water lights and it
says it's a water-based highlighting
eyeshadow with bouncy texture and
metallic effect long-lasting and that's
it do I get any directions let's just
open these up and so kind of looks like
a Paint Pot it looks like it's gonna be
great
it's like a jelly can you guys tell oh
my god I kind of love it
look at that color okay this one's like
not very not as smooth as the other one
but here is what it looks like I'm
thinking this one's gonna be my favorite
but we will see moving on to the
eyeshadow I'm gonna keep it basic and
make these ones pop so we'll probably
just stick with the max so I'll just go
in with this shade right here and put
this into my crease these do have quite
a bit of kickback on the palette I don't
know if you guys can see so we're just
going to blend this M have it as our
transition shade
so we've got that on it's not badly is
what the palette looks like after going
in you can see there is a bit of
kickback but not much at all nothing to
really complain about you know what I
mean next step I'm going to go in with
probably the shade probably I don't know
if that's a good idea but we're gonna
try it and we're just gonna put this
right into that crease and a little bit
in the outer V they have some pigment
but they're just a little boring you
know like there's not a lot going on
with them they're just very plain Jane
eye shadows but they do have some color
payoff so they're not as bad as I
thought they would be to be honest with
you okay so I'm gonna go in with this
Aquafresh highlighting eyeshadow in
luminous sensation this is the one i
swatched and loved and I'm gonna use my
finger on one eye and just see how it
works this seems like it has more color
payoff like I said oh my goodness it
kind of matches my sweatshirt in a
really weird amazing way Wow and it
feels like cooling on the eye it's a
very different feeling I'm gonna use my
brush now to see if I can kind of get it
more clean it did apply on the brush
really nicely but that is so pretty
I'm really into stuff like this you know
things with a lot of shine the metallic
look to it I love it okay so I'm
actually going to go into the other
color at the water lights one okay now
it's starting to burn my eyes a little
bit
don't burn okay so I'm going into this
one I want to see if it applies better
on the eye
oh this one isn't as smooth but it is
really pretty like even just to use as
the pop of color on the lid and they
like dry down it's not the smoothest I
want to see what it looks like like
popped in the center of this one right
here
yeah I like it more as like a lid popper
something to really draw the eye light
to the center of the lid instead of all
over because it starts to get a little
chunky this one has like a bouncy or
texture to it has more movement I'm
really impressed I like this I will
definitely be using it more next up I
have this glam doll a super black liner
and it says that it is waterproof so
it's a little felt tip like that I'm
gonna line my eyes with this and see how
it lays over this stuff's very black I
don't know if you can put liner over
this cream product it's starting to like
chunk up right in here very weird okay
let me see if I can do another layer on
top of it so I just want to see if I can
go over it with this Milani stay-put
matte eyeliner just to see if like liner
can go over it does dry it down it kind
of feels like I have lash glue stuck in
here you know that feeling when you have
lash glue stuck and like sometimes your
eye like sticks together it's like how I
feel like my lid feels so I think
because I went in with that first felt
tip it was kind of a little bit stiffer
like the felt tip was a little bit more
stiff then this one this one has quite a
bit of movement I think that's why I
started to kind of chunk up but this eye
is not bad like it's not moving on this
one and clumping up so maybe just use a
liner that has a lot of movement to it
nothing that's too stiff have the
Catrice glam and dawa volumizing mascara
and it says it has triple boost with
argan oil so that's what it looks like
and then the brush what what is this a
primer oh it's a primer crap and this
one's a mascara I never use eyelash
primer just because I feel like I don't
need it but tomorrow I'm wearing false
lashes so we'll go ahead and try it I
don't have like a makeup remover for
waterproof makeup because I never wear
waterproof makeup
I always curl my lashes because they
just like a droop down so much so I'm
gonna use this primer first I don't know
doesn't really look like much on my eye
which I guess is good okay it's a little
thick I'm going in with the mascara on
top not impressed the primer doesn't
have like any fibers in or anything I
know a lot of mascara primers have the
little fibers this one doesn't and I
don't feel like it's very volumizing it
looks very just like a basic mascara
nothing crazy maybe let me try it with a
different mascara so I'm gonna use it
with the benefit roller lash just to see
if it makes it a little bit more
volumizing so again I'm gonna take that
primer and just put that on my eyes yeah
it didn't make the benefit one look any
more volumizing so I say pass on that
and on the mascara they're not anything
crazy amazing so the light correcting
serum primer in the candle light and it
basically just says liquid primer with
aloe vera contains light reflecting
pigments for a subtle glow on the skin
like a flattering candlelight shimmer
you use alone or under makeup shake well
so I have the Catrice HD liquid those
open liquid foundation I also have this
primer which is the prime and fine pore
refining anti-shine primer base so we'll
be seeing if I need to use as well if
this is like to luminizing so it looks
like oh you guys can see oh it's like
really thin glow it doesn't feel
anything like that it does give a glow
if anything like sets into the skin so
quickly kind of see the glow of my
fingers to that just like sunk into the
skin so fast I feel like I really didn't
have that much time to blend it out so I
am gonna go in with the poor finding
anti-shine base since it's pore refining
I just want to put this on my pores
kind of looks like a lotion type of
thing I'm gonna put this in my t-zone
actually don't mind that like reflecting
primer because it added a glow but it
wasn't like it was very nice how it sink
into the skin like if you have dry skin
I think you might not like that
don't know about poor feelin Boylan I
don't know about poor feeling just yet
but we will see it with this foundation
I haven't really used this foundation
might I'm gonna use it with a brush
first I got some new brushes from morphe
on a try I actually got like a morphe
set from Ulta this brush came in it it
doesn't say numbers or anything on it it
literally just says morphe so we're just
gonna test this out and see how it
looked
put this all over I'm gonna just buff it
in very mattifying I don't know if it's
the primer I've tried this foundation
before so I need to go watch that video
wondering why I never used this
foundation this is the kind of coverage
I get it's not like bad I don't feel
like the primer really minimized look at
my pores cuz I can definitely tell I got
some pores going on I think if I use
this foundation with my favorite pore
filling primers it'll be completely fine
I feel like you kind of used looses
candlelight glow with that foundation
but this was really nice it did add a
really pretty glow now I'm gonna use the
liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer I think I've used this before
but it wasn't obsessed with it and I
want to figure out why oh I have another
concealing product I should not have
done this right now okay I'll just do
one eye with this one
whew that burns I think this is why I
didn't use it let me use this Real
Techniques sponge that is not the huge
sponge that I love but it's here and
it's very just oh not not cute I pass on
that but we do have other concealer
products and a corrector so this is the
all-around corrector my eyes burning but
this is the all-around color correction
palette and then we do have the same
thing pretty much but this one has
concealer and I'm going to use this one
to get rid of some of this darkness
right in here I'm sure this is the same
as like the pot one that I used in
another video but
pretty dang good that got rid of the
darkness that's for sure
this one's the lightest shade this one's
like the medium toned that's what I'm
going to use I cut my brush in this and
paint this on like I do my NARS
concealer I love the NARS concealer in
the pot it's just amazing and has full
coverage and looks really good on my
skin so we will see how this one looks I
think it looks okay umm I can't tell
which one I like more but I don't think
I'm obsessed with the coverage I like a
lot of coverage we all know this I
definitely like this concealer palette
better than that only concealer that we
used I don't hate it
I kind of like it so I'm gonna go in
with that same lighter shade the medium
toned one and I'm just gonna put this on
my cheeks to cover up that redness much
much much better okay now we're gonna do
is take the lightest shade in here which
is this one and highlight my face with
this definitely like this concealer with
a brush
don't I have a mattifying powder okay
I'm actually going to take this Catrice
all matte plus shine control powder and
I'm going to set my face with this and
I'm going to just press into my skin and
mattify everything that made a
difference geez okay see now we're back
in business
so Catrice did come out with this
professional makeup techniques face
palette but has what it is on this
little sheet you get a really nice
mirror nothing crazy so you have some
creams and some mats obviously we're
gonna be using the maps today you have
matte contouring matte bronzing matte
blush pearly blush matte powder matte
cream you have two creams in here which
is this one and then this silver color
the rest of them are matte which is very
nice I'm actually going to take this
yellow tone powder and put that
underneath my eyes just to brighten it
up a little bit more bright in this area
maybe this brush might be too big for
this I don't really see a difference but
we'll just do it the other side so I'm
gonna do the bronzer now this one right
here and use that same morphe brush the
pans are a little small so it's a little
bit tricky to get your brush in there
means like the payoffs nice so oh I like
that kind of color that is bronzy blend
on my forehead what's going on I like
the color I think it's looking a little
splotchy right here it might be because
my forehead is so dry boy with the
contour right here I'm just gonna
contour my cheeks I'm gonna use a light
amount because it kind of woo I like the
fact that these are mostly matte shades
okay so this does have a blush in it but
I also have some blushes right here and
this one's kind of calling my name this
is Miss amber brown this is a smooth
powder blush for a strobing effect with
a natural-looking luminous finish and
glow on the cheeks this is what it looks
like this color just looks absolutely
stunning we're going to try this one out
I don't hate it but I'm not the biggest
fan of strobing blushes just because
I've got lots of texture and lots of
pores and strobing blushes will normally
bring that out but it's not terrible I
do like the color it's more like a
bronzy color I do want to try this like
with my regular foundations but that's
really pretty
they also have a more moth pink this is
the Miss Rosalie berry and then you have
this kind of coral peach shade it's miss
summer peach I do like it but it does
accentuate texture and pores so if you
don't struggle with that you'll be fine
but edit will see I kind of want to see
what this matte blush in here looks like
and we're gonna be this is pigmented oh
my gosh this is hella pigmented I'm only
doing a light wash of that Wow
we're not going anywhere today guys it's
like in the evening so it really doesn't
matter what I do to my face right now
this is a highlighting powder in
champagne campaign then we also have the
gold highlighter in the palette I kind
of like I'm really filling this palette
I feel like with my regular products I
will be obsessed with this of course
when you try a bunch of new things at
once you never know like what could be
causing certain things so like with this
I'll definitely try it with my regular
primers try this with my regular
foundation and stuff like that but I
find these videos fun just to kind of
try everything out at once we're gonna
try one on one side and one on the other
I'm going to use this new highlighting
brush I go to my morphe looks very fancy
so I'm going to use a champagne campaign
highlighter first
where's it at that might be the brush
though so let's go in with my favorite
highlighting brush on estancia 83 see
that's why I don't like fan brushes they
play you they try not to highlight you
as much as you want
that's pretty no I got a lot of my face
right now me and it's showing some
texture but that is pretty a really
gorgeous highlight but the glow it gives
is just really beautiful now I'm gonna
use the one in the palette this one
right here and they say that this one's
a blush I'm not using that as a blush
I'm not ever gonna probably use that
mainly because that will show my
textures way more than it should be
shown oh that's pretty
I like that gold highlight Oh see I
can't stop can't stop won't stop
that is pretty I like this palette even
though there's a couple shades I will
probably never use in here I like the
palette as a whole I think it is really
nice it has kind of like a little bit of
everything that you need to highlight
contour whatever with now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna fill in my brows these
are the climatic ultra precise brow
pencils you have two shades that might
work well for me so here is light and
medium I think I'm gonna go in with
medium first and does have a spoolie on
the end which if you know me you know I
love a good spoolie I'm normally a
pomade kind of person but I'll try
anything
this is nice
let me tell you I haven't tried a brow
pencil that I really like it a long time
these are creamy easy to use I do feel
like I would go through this pretty
quickly but I feel like everybody does
with their brow pencils moving on to the
last thing we're going to try today for
the video and that is this liquid lip
powder ultra matte so it says liquid
intense color pigments for a powdery
matte and long-lasting finish on the
lips this one is in the shade Caffe
americano please that's so cute
this is what the applicator looks like I
actually kind of like this applicator
see how it looks on the lips
I like the color so that's Caffe
americano please but I'm gonna go in
with a darker color and this one is in
many little roses this is a little bit
darker see if it's pigmented whoa yeah
there we go
can't say I purchased more colors
because these are pretty thin and sheer
I would definitely have to use them with
a lip liner like the powdery matte look
looks really nice so they already have
the makeup transforming drops I have the
lightening and darkening ones for
foundation so they came out with more
for your foundation and they have the
waterproof and the wakeup effect so very
excited to try the waterproof I feel
like I just got to test this out I got
to see really make something waterproof
or not I just find that so interesting
I'll also let you guys know more about
these primers as I use them because I
feel like these products on their own
would be really great but together maybe
not so much maybe they're a little too
drying and then I think my favorite
thing that I tried is the eyebrow
pencils and I don't even like eyebrow
pencils but I really like these because
they were so easy to use so let me know
what down Bluff you're gonna pick up
anything that I showed in this video
today and yeah I will see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
