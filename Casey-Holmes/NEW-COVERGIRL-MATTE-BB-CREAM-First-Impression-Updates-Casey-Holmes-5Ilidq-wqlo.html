impression for you if you follow my
snapchat I did a PR haul slash some
things I bought from Ulta haul and just
shared with you the new things that I
got in the mail as I've been traveling
so much they haven't been able to really
keep up with all the PR packages but I
ordered some things from Ulta and he
wanted to do a first impression on one
of the products so this is like my
little first impressions been like I
need to play with all these products but
one of the things I was most excited
about was the covergirl clean matte BB
cream a for oily skin I have not tried a
BB cream and so long one drugstore BB
cream that I love is the Garnier BB
cream I used to use that all the time I
stopped using it because the smell just
started to get to me because it does
kind of have that alcohol smell at least
when I used it a couple years ago it did
I don't know if they updated that or not
should probably check that out but when
I saw these on Twitter I was so excited
about them I forget who had posted it
maybe it was covergirl I don't know
where I saw these but I was super
excited I was like I'm gonna have to try
these so I got two shades I got the
colors 540 and 550 and basically what it
says is that it's oil-free it won't
cause poor claws bores the won't clog
pores is suitable for sensitive skin and
it lasts all day as it provides the
perfect amount of coverage to even skin
tone hide blemishes and keep you shine
free all day so I'm going to try these
out so I'm gonna go ahead and put back
my hair and I am going to moisturize I
know some people don't like to
moisturize with BB creams because that's
kind of the reason why you have a BB
cream is for an all-in-one product but I
personally do like to moisturize
separately so I've been using this G
Vashi Hydra sparkling shine no more
moisturizer and I showed this in my last
haul which is my Sephora haul and I
don't know how I feel about just yet it
is a very strong scent but it does
moisturize really well and doesn't leave
you shiny or anything like that
um but yeah it does have a pretty strong
smell and the smell lasts until I would
say like 15 minutes or so or if you put
your makeup on top right away it'll go
away as well if you're sensitive to
smells just be forewarned that this does
have a pretty strong scent I have no
idea which one I want to use these are
one fluid ounce which is nice I forget
how much I pay
I'll leave it in an annotation somewhere
right here because it's been so long
since I purchased it so this one's
medium deep let's just swatch this one
so that one's medium deep that might be
the color that I use and this one is
medium so there's medium in the medium
deep I'm probably gonna be the shade and
medium deep so I'm going to use that on
my face today and then if it's a little
too dark we'll just highlight with our
concealer which I'm going to use the Too
Faced Born This Way because I've been
loving this concealer it's so good so
I'm going to apply this two different
ways I'm going to do a beauty blender on
one side and then a brush on the other
so I'm just going to put some of this on
the back of my hand and then I'm going
to take my Beauty Blender and just Pat
this in oh that looks a lot darker when
it goes on the skin this has more of a
red undertone for sure so that's what it
looks like so far with a Beauty Blender
um let's see if you can build this up
now baby creams aren't supposed to be
like full coverage or anything like that
but I do like a full coverage finish so
if it's not something that's full
coverage and I'm putting on a full face
of makeup I usually won't use it this is
it with the Beauty Blender it actually
doesn't look bad does have pretty good
coverage it even out my skin tone you
can see right here the redness is
peeking through I haven't used it on my
nose yet that's like the true test and
then over here it just looks more even
and it is drying to a matte finish it's
kind of a dhimmi matte finish because I
do see a little bit of shine I don't
know if you guys can see it as well
let's turn this down a little bit so you
guys can probably see there's a little
bit of shine it's kind of like a Dimi
matte finish it's not a flat matte right
now so I'm going to use my Marc Jacobs
brush I love this little brush right
here and I'm going to put this on as
well depending on what kind of formula
the BB cream is use either better to use
it with a brush or sponge just depends
this is kind of a thicker formula so I
like the middle under a lot
you
okay so with a brush it looks pretty
good too since I can use a beauty
blender I would much rather use that
it's just what I would prefer and I'm
just going to take this and dab it over
my nose see if I need a little more
coverage and I did which is nice I think
I'll say is I've noticed like since I
like a full coverage finish I have been
using a lot of this just to kind of get
a nice coverage with it um you don't
have to use as much as I'm using but
that's just my preference I don't like
to use things and not have high coverage
or like a pretty good medium coverage so
I've noticed I've used a lot of products
so far so this doesn't have super light
coverage which I enjoy I don't like
things with very light coverage so this
is my face with the BB cream on it is
more of a matte finish which I enjoy it
has a Demi matte finish I believe I
wouldn't say it makes my skin look
awesome I feel like you can really see
texture on my skin and like my pores my
rosacea I do have like kind of rough
texture here on my cheeks and sometimes
products can really bring that texture
out I kind of feel like it is right now
it's also kind of sinking into my pores
a little bit but I'm going to add some
concealer case so concealer is on I do
have a pretty matte finish right now one
thing I will say is I'm not liking the
way it kind of looks on my nose with the
concealer and the BB cream but
everything else pretty much looks good
it doesn't look too caked on or anything
like that it doesn't feel heavy at all
either it does feel a little bit sticky
so I'm gonna put a powder on top just a
translucent one I'm using this to shadow
one whatever it's called I neither read
the comments on my latest video and
figure out how to say this again because
I totally forgot I'm actually gonna bake
I'm a real big fan of baking and I find
sometimes if my pores look a little too
cray-cray
because of our product baking usually
helps so I'm hoping this kind of helps a
little bit with the look of my textures
and like I hope it just kind of helps
fill in those pores ok so we are just
going to let that sit and I'm gonna do
my brows and the rest of my face get on
a phone call because I have five minutes
time Swiss feet in a meeting so I'm
gonna let this sit bake and then I'm
gonna finish dressed my face makeup I
will see you in
a second okay so I just finished the
rest of my face makeup or the BB cream
it does looks pretty good it right now
it has like a full coverage finish just
because I did concealing I did powder I
did bronzer I did a whole nine yards
sometimes I have an issue with drugstore
foundations just clinging to all my
texture and my pores and everything but
this doesn't look terrible I'm liking it
so far
we know in the comments which you guys
think so far since we are just starting
out with this video right now is
actually 2:23 so I'm going to go
throughout the day and wear this we're
going to see if it does stay matte
because I am pretty matte right now it
doesn't feel matte but I look matte
which I like gonna wear this throughout
the day I have another video to film I
have some errands to run so it's gonna
be in do I even have my mic on yes I did
so it's going to be a nice busy day to
test this bad boy out I know what you
guys think I really like this eyeshadow
look though I think I want to once is
going on here so I'll be back in just a
few hours to give you guys an update on
this foundation hey guys so I'm out and
about right now and I'm at my first stop
which is sips in Atlanta so I figured I
would do an update real quick for you
guys because I really want to put some
powder on my face as you can probably
see I have some shininess here and there
on my forehead or my chin basically in
the t-zone which is I mean it's not like
disgusting oil it's just the stuff that
you know you want to blot off and just
get off your skin I usually have some
bloody cheeks from Pilate oh that I
always use but I can't find that right
now so I'm just going to just a little
bit of powder over my face so I'm using
the si edit flash photo powder it's in
0-1 blue bright and she's just the one
that I keep in my purse as well as this
Mac little mini stippling brush I can't
read the numbers on because they're so
little I'm just gonna stroll a little
bit in there and just put it right over
my Chi's own
and just like mattifies the faces you
can see there's like a sand all over my
camera shout out to go onto the beach
otherwise it does look really good I
obviously have a full face of makeup on
and I'm like really casual of course I
changed I'm like that person who people
are like did you just take get your
makeup done because you know like my
face is completely dyed in my outfit is
like leggings in the t-shirts start
behind
so that's update for now it's for 41
right now let's go shop okay guys I am
back it is blazing right now um but it's
6:17 I've been walking around for quite
a bit I thought it was gonna be out of
here earlier but I wasn't so loved you
guys can see but it's 6:18 I tried on
some sunglasses in these it stayed on
pretty well through the sunglass trying
on because I did try on a lot of them so
that's pretty nice so far it still looks
really good I had a ton of people
compliment me on my makeup which was
really nice even though it's starting to
look like super dull now it's really
nice to hear it is a little bit shiny
it's not sticky like after I said it it
just hasn't been sticky like it was so I
like that it doesn't feel like oil is
sitting on top of the skin it feels like
all I need honestly
I can feel a little bit of oil so all I
need is something to like blot my face
with I don't think I even have anything
blot my visa you know we're going to do
we're going to take this moisture tissue
paper and what any blonde given rely
quite as well as you know so just like
yeah I know but oily skin probs
oh yeah see and I just going to take the
shine away if I had my Pilate Oh
blotting sheets those are amazing
they're like rice paper blotting sheets
they have like a rice powder on one side
and then just like a regular paper on
the other I like to use one with powder
on the side so that way I don't have to
go in and powder my face but so far so
good I mean this is actually doing a lot
better than I thought it would it's not
too shiny it is matte especially with
everything going on I know I feel like
my face looks super weird
and this lighting but my highlight is
extra because I was filming so I know
these people probably like wow that
highlight okay it's time to go home I
did some damage I'm gonna wear
sunglasses on the way home see how it
wears usually sunglasses leaving marks
anyways but we'll see what happens
hey guys so I'm back looking pretty
daring oily but it is 11:10 as you can
see right there and I wanted to conclude
this video because hey I'm really tired
B I'm ready to take off his makeup and
way to go to bed I want to give you guys
just an update I want to say that this
is a pretty good BB cream like I'm
pretty impressed by it the suti cream
lasted all day long I'm worn out in the
heat I went and do my errands as you
guys saw and it lasted really well it's
just now at this time where it's
starting to kind of rub off my nose all
of you guys can see right here but it's
starting to wear off my nose it's very
shiny my poor just shouldn't really pop
out very shiny on the forehead but
considering I started this first
impression at like 2:30 I know it's like
11:10 I think that's pretty good pretty
emergy much lasted all day and BB creams
don't normally last that long so I
personally do like this I'm not gonna
say I'm gonna use it every single time I
do my makeup just because I do love a
full glam and I like to do pretty much
the whole shebang I love a full coverage
foundation like right off the bat but
this is a pretty great product it
handled really well on my oily skin I
had to blot probably about three times
today which isn't terrible it could be
way worse in those hours I have tried
some foundations drugstore and high-end
wipeout blot like ten times in a day
it's ridiculous this is
when it says a matte BB cream it does
last wow I'm pretty impressed by this so
far so first impressions I'm really
liking it I like the packaging I think
it's a very sleek package very compact
easy to travel with I think this is a
perfect product if you want something
quick to put on your face you're going
to run errands you just don't want a lot
of makeup definitely try this out of
course I put on a lot of makeup on top
of it just because that's how I am I'm
excessive like that you can see myself
using this and just concealer and
mascara
and like a gimme brow or something and
going right out the door to run errands
if I wanted to wear makeup because I
don't wear makeup every single day I
give this a two thumbs up let me know if
you guys have tried this in the comments
below I like it so far
I will definitely keep you updated in my
favorites hits and misses I think that's
it I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you all in my next one bye
you
I can never ever find the right word
there's no way this is real life there's
no telling you're the right girl so I
can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
