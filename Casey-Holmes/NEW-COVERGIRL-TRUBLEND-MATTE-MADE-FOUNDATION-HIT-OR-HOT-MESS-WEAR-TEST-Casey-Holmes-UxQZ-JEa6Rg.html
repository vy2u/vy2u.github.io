be sharing with you a where tests on the
new covergirl trublend Mac made a
foundation I'm gonna take you guys
throughout my day show you my favorite
way to apply it using my regular primers
and you'll see how it lasts on my oily
skin throughout the day and I do look
like more coverage so you're also gonna
see that as well my skin is pretty red
right now I'm having a little flare-up I
don't know why maybe because I'm a
little hot but yeah so I'm gonna give
you guys to wear tests today I hope you
guys are excited to see this video and
see my opinions on this foundation if
you are then definitely keep watching
and don't forget to subscribe before you
leave and hit that post notification
bell so you will know the next video I
need to take this off so you will know
the next time I upload a video so hi
beautiful so if you want to see how this
foundation wears out the day then let's
just go ahead and get started does
anyone else hate freshly killed hair
like I cannot stand freshly curled hair
because I can't stand tight curls I'm
more of a trying to get a hair clip I'm
working on it I'm more of a beachy waves
kind of girl and I do not like the way a
hair looks when it's just curled like I
think it's just too much for me it's too
proper I need it to be loose and wavy
and like not put together kind of like
my life though I'll be using my regular
primers today I have the Smashbox
photo-finish so chill so chill coconut
and then the touches silk canvas primer
these are my two favorite primers to use
with pretty much any foundation once I
find a good primer combo I don't
normally switch out very often so yeah
these have been my go-to and I'm gonna
give you a little info on this
foundation I have I believe 40 shades
and right now on covergirl coms website
it says that you can get it on Amazon
for eight dollars and forty four cents
and it is sold out on Walgreens com
it says from your favorite covergirl
foundation line comes a matte formula
that isn't drying or cakey the troublin
matte maids formula is developed with
flexi whole technology that creates a
strong yet flexible film on skin for
durability and comfort while the
mattifying powders absorb oil and
minimizes pores for soft matte flawless
in age of our comfort mat
pore-minimizing oil control transfer
resistant and all forty shades so I'm
going to show you guys this today I
haven't won it quite a few times and I
think I have a good a good opinion on it
first things first I'm going to apply my
primer
okay the shade I think I'm going to use
today I think I'm going to use the shade
m80 don't mind my hands you know what
are you gonna do to apply it my favorite
way to apply it is with a flat top brush
so I am going to use the one that I have
from morphe right here I got this in a
set from Ulta and I find that you get
more coverage with a brush and I
personally like more of a full coverage
finish so that's why I'm gonna use this
brush today so just gonna apply it it
does have a smell to it but I don't find
that it's really too much I think it's
fine mention this in one of my previous
videos I cannot get full coverage on my
nose with this product even when I do
concealer on top of it it's like the
foundation doesn't want to sit on my
nose and I would try new primers but the
foundation sits fine on the rest of my
skin it's just my nose will not cover
with a sponge with a brush none of it so
I really have to pack on concealer when
I do use this foundation another thing
too is I don't think that this is very
matte I know it's a mat made foundation
it's not supposed to be like drying
matte or anything which I do appreciate
but you will see that it is definitely
not matte it looks beautiful on the skin
does minimize the pores I feel like it
really smooths out your skin it looks
good for a $9 foundation you know it is
better than the other trublend
foundation that they have not super
duper matte if you don't like drying
mattes don't worry this is not that kind
of foundation it's not drying whatsoever
on me at least I feel like it has a more
dewy finish than most matte foundations
so what I'm doing now is I'm just kind
of pressing into the areas where I mean
good coverage so that's my forehead
and my cheeks need a little bit more
coverage so I'm kind of just pressing
product in there taking whatever's left
on the back of my hand
nice and seamless this color
pretty good I did apply a fresh new
layer of self-tanner last night it's not
a super dark self-tanner as you can tell
because I'm not that tan but this m80
shade did work out pretty well for me
I just need like bronze my chest a
little bit so if you can see here it's
just not covering a lot on my nose I
don't even think you can really tell on
camera but it's just not covering as
much as I want and in here it's
definitely not full coverage but it's
more coverage if you use the brush and
also having like a little flare up so
keep in mind that could be the reason
why in my last video it looked super
full coverage but now you're really
seeing like okay it's not super full
coverage but it is definitely medium to
full it's gonna depend on your skin type
it's gonna bend on what you have to
cover but when I have a flare up it's
definitely not full coverage but that's
okay because it's covering up enough
where when I go on with concealer it's
gonna help add extra coverage and make
sure we look nice and even yeah I think
it does look it on the skin no it really
does not emphasize pores I feel like it
looks like fresh glowy skin but
appropriate for people that have oily
skin you know it doesn't feel heavy it's
not super sticky or anything like that
what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna apply
my concealers I'll come back show you
guys the completed makeup look what it
looks like when it's set all into place
and everything is on top I will go ahead
and say that everything does blend on
top of the foundation really beautifully
the concealer does it all kind of like
just melts in together and looks really
beautiful yeah everything else that goes
on top does sit very well so I will show
you guys the end makeup look and then
I'll wear it throughout the day for you
guys I have a lot of things to do I'll
be outside inside moving around a lot so
you guys will see how it really works
yeah I will be right back after I
finished my makeup look okay guys so my
makeup is all it done what do you think
we're glowing used that new makeup
revolution highlight palette so just
real quick my lifes are the my life's my
eyes are from the lunar Beauty life's a
drag palette I did use this makeup
revolution a highlight face quad they
don't know if it's out yet I can't find
it I got it in PR so I will definitely
let you guys know when it is in stock my
list is just this lip liner from bare
mineral it's in the color on point this
is the gen new
under over lipliner he's a really creamy
you can just wear him as a lip color
which is what I did today that's what I
have on my lips so this is what the
foundation looks like I think it looks
really good everything is really sitting
on top of it beautifully again this
doesn't really emphasize pores it
doesn't emphasize texture it just looks
really nice on the skin I definitely
feel like this is more of a natural
matte foundation I really like it I
think it looks really good and I've used
this with some other products as well
and it's worked really real with those
like I chose you guys I'm gonna take you
throughout my day I'm gonna be outside
trying to take some Instagram photos I'm
gonna try to go to this one area to take
an Instagram photo I have this vision
that I want to make come to life I don't
know if I can do it by myself so we'll
see I'm gonna use self timer and all
that kind of stuff and right now it is
133 and I will check back in with you
guys in just a couple hours okay guys so
I'm out here at Sacketts Harbor right
now I'm that person taking photos of
themselves and I didn't get the shot
that I I know I want but I can do it
another time because I think the shot
that I want I need like different
accessories and different outfit just
gonna be really cute whenever I get
someone to take it up me out here now
but if you gotta give you guys an update
it is for 51 right now it's actually not
that hot it's hot when you're like just
standing in one place I did have my
sunglasses on for me shooting these
photos of myself and it did kind of come
off on my nose which that normally
happens with foundations anyway so I'm
not like too harsh on it because happens
all the time I mean even with the best
foundations that are some of my
favorites but so far
I mean it's looking pretty good I could
use Apple audio blotting sheet for sure
but I do have my roof off on my Jeep so
I'm a little bit dewier than I probably
normally would be but I will say it
looks really good in this natural light
and even with the Sun beaming down on me
it doesn't look cakey or anything which
I appreciate
so yeah it's looking really good so far
and like I said just on my nose it's
kind of coming off I hope it looks ok on
camera I'm like saying I think it looks
really good at natural light but we'll
see right now I just got done shooting
I'll show you guys what I did how
embarassing I am I am literally that
person wouldn't be surprised you know
people take snapshots of others like
taking pictures of themselves
I would totally not be surprised if that
happen to me but I had my camera here
like this all the way out here taking
photos of myself and then I moved it
over here this is Carmen by the way here
a new to my channel I've had Carmen for
a while yeah I wanted to take the Jeep
out I wanted to get out get some cute
photos and I got the photo so I'm very
excited I got the photo I think now I
can head home and edit I need to make a
video live so as I'm gonna do but I am
pretty hot right now it's really
beautiful up here right now I've been
outside all weekend just because it
feels amazing and it's just it's a good
summer like summer is really nice up
here it's not like Georgia where it's
super humid or anything like that it's
just nice it's warm with a breeze that's
really all you need I wanted to give you
guys this update I forgot to take off my
band for the photo I'm that person who
forgets to take off their hair bow
and I'll see you guys in just a little
bit for another update okay guys so it
is now 1037 and I'm ready to take my
makeup off and and go to bed that was
rose but if you could hear her and I'm
gonna do a little bit of self tanner on
my chest to to kind of just darken me up
a little bit besides the point I've had
this foundation on all day at out in the
Sun taking photos I was sweating like I
told you guys I had sunglasses on so
that's why I have sunglass marks it kind
of makes my nose look skinnier but I
haven't added any more powder I did blot
once with like just some toilet paper or
like really quickly they haven't used
like a proper blotting sheet so this is
what it looks like I think it looks
really good I mean my highlight so on my
blush my bronzer everything is still
pretty intense like my brows it did kind
of wear off on my chin I don't recall
touching my face but it did kind of rub
off here at some point but for the most
part other than obvious areas like right
here which I thought this is gonna be
worse so that's not bad at all
I think the foundation lasted really
well throughout the day and I would
recommend it if you have oily skin and
don't live in a super humid
scorching-hot area where sweating a lot
like right now the summer here is great
it's just nice and warm it's kind of
toasty and it's breezy so you know it's
not too intense where if I was in
Georgia and it was super hot and humid
I feel like this won't last as long
because I do think I get a little bit
more oily with this quicker like I feel
like if you want something more
mattifying
definitely go with the LA girl Pro matte
foundation I think that was gonna keep
you mad for a lot longer it has a really
great finish as well but I also really
enjoy the finish of this - I think it
looks really good
like I said it doesn't emphasize your
texture or your pores and I've just been
really enjoying it it doesn't bring me
out whatsoever I wish it was a little
bit more full coverage but then again
you know not every foundation is gonna
be full coverage so you can't have it
all I actually like the coverage of this
one I really just like the way that it
makes my skin look and this lasted
pretty well for me so yeah I really like
this foundation I give it a two thumbs
up I think it lasts really well on my
skin cuz I was sweating a lot earlier
and it survived somehow yeah let me know
what you guys think have you tried out
this foundation what are your thoughts I
feel like it looked great I was really
surprised
in the car and I looked in my mirror and
I was like oh my god my pores don't look
insanely big sometimes that can happen
you wear like your favorite foundation
then you go out in the Sun when the
sun's hitting you and it just looks like
I hope you enjoyed this video if you
want to know how I take off my makeup I
will leave my nighttime routine down
below and you can see what products I
use to take all my makeup off which is
what I'll be doing for my face tonight I
love you guys thank you for watching I
will see you all in my next video bye
sorry I forgot I had this Alex 90% on
it's probably jinglun the whole time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
