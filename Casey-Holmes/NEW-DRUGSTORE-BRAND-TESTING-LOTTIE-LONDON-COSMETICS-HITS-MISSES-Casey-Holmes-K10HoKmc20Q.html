today I have an exciting video because
you guys know I love drugstore I know a
lot of you love drugstore and there's a
new a brand that just launched that Ulta
online and I snagged everything as quick
as I could because I have a lot of you
asking me if I was going to do a review
so I definitely wanted to get a little
bit of everything so we can review it
see that the textures like all the
formulas everything is so cute it's
called Lottie London and I think the
highest price that I paid was like
$12.99 I mean the concealer is around $5
50 Cent's we have a powder we have some
foundation primers I hope you guys are
excited to see this video and don't
forget to subscribe before you leave and
if you want to see all of these new
products tested out then let's just go
ahead and get started
I did get a primer from them I don't
even know if they have a primer online
but I personally love to give I shadows
a fair shot because I have very oily
eyelids and I use two specific primers
one from Smashbox that I would use today
but I can't find anywhere and then also
this NARS one they're my favorites for
oily eyelid okay so the first thing I
want to show you is the shadow swatch
12-piece eyes shadow palette these are
so gorgeous and now when I try new
products I like to go for colors that I
know I'm going to wear so you just open
it up it's very thick packaging umm if
you guys can tell it's very very thick
and I like that cuz I feel like it's
travel friendly
it does come with this little brush with
a brush on one side and sponge on the
other and then here are your shade so
when I first saw this palette it
reminded me of the naked heat then again
I have not actually looked at naked
close and personal like mine still in
the package because I just got it at PR
they're similar but they're not
identical so up top is just drop the
brush up top is naked heat tested bottom
is the lobby London palette so they're
definitely different but I mean if you
wanted to go for something like it you
know you never know so we're just going
to move on to this palette I'm going to
take this shade right here and put this
all over my lid
okay next step I'm going to go in with
this shade right here and I'm going to
use this in my crease
ooh that's a really pretty crease shade
oh it's like salt blending out really
well not choppy at all I believe this
tile is $12.99 so far so good
again I dig it all my stuff on Ulta calm
I don't know if they're like in stores I
did just go to Ulta sing like this past
weekend and I did not see any things
just keep that in mind this is like
super pretty going in with this shade
right here I'm going to pop this into my
crease right below that first shade we
just put on so a next step I'm just
going to do my deeper shade first and
then we'll go in with one of these a
shimmer shades but I'm going to use this
one in the next and you can put this
right in the outer V and in the crease
going a little bit more on my lid I
think this looks really pretty I mean if
you guys have noticed the colors or the
shadows are not choppy at all they're
really smooth and blending out so easily
like I'm very impressed right now then
I'm just going to take that deeper shade
and go right in that out of Z flip it
out here to end up just a little bit
more so that's what looks like the
deeper shades are not very pigmented you
can see that's a swatch right there it's
a little bit more sheer um let's go in
with this one let's just do it well go
into this one right here and I'm going
to just put this
so that shimmer shade is okay I don't
think it's the best but it does add some
shine I'm going to try a little bit of
lyrical and let's just see what it looks
like all I want to do is just see if it
will be a little bit more intense on the
lid with this next also has like a
glitter glue like this that's really
great as well
colors look so pretty I just want them
to be nice and vibrant so let's just put
this in here okay not very much I mean
definitely helped look that on camera it
looks really good I feel like in person
it looks very basic that should probably
me being like a shimmer smells like I
know what shimmer shadows I love not bad
at all
taking that I'm just going to take that
brush I'm even using with the warm shade
you can go over the edges just to make
sure everything is nice and blended and
then what I'm going to use is a liquid
liner this is the wing woman felt tip
liner you guys know I love felt tip
liners they're my favorite I've tested
them okay so here is a liner Maddie we
move in those who salted looks nice
let's do it
whoa damn I really did not press down
hard at all it's going to be good wow
that is so black
the felt tip is really nice and
saturated so it's not dragging across
the lid and I can just press up against
my lashes and get full pigment it's
amazing it's very easy to work with
I love how black it is and it looks like
it's drying matte that's all I need a
nice honestly that's the best wing line
I think I've done in like a year
no I'm just kidding it's got a really
damn good eyeliner moving onto primer
I'm going to be trying the Lottie London
Institute LLL tear Court eraser stick
basically it's just supposed to make
your pores look like filtered and
blurred out so we will see come to the
stick form oh it's very smooth what do
you guys think so this is the all about
that base foundation stick I got two
colors golden and beige and on the
bottoms they look the same so we're
going to see so the two different shades
this one is beige a little pinky to me
and then we have golden I think I really
tried golden so I'm just going to put
this on my face or do half of my face
with this you guys know I love the new
hourglass foundation better try this
I hope it's good I'm going to be using
this luck CBD Wonder Woman brush
ah you can still see the rosacea peeking
through it doesn't look terrible on the
skin but you can definitely see if you
can through so I'm going to see if I
could build it up and try tapping it in
okay so you can build it up and it
doesn't look bad on the skin so that's
with two full layers it's not really
accentuating pores or anything like that
I still feel like there's a little bit
of redness peeking through I wouldn't
say this is super full covers and I
wouldn't say it's matte it's more of
like a natural finish I do have a
feeling this is going to be interesting
to wear all day so let's just put this
back so I feel like tapping with your
brush is better just so you're not
moving the product around everywhere and
it doesn't I mean you can feel it on a
scan but it's not super heavy it's just
something you know you can feel I kind
of feel like it's going to break up on
my forehead I feel like that looks
pretty good I went in with a heavy
amount this time on this cheek and I
didn't have to go back in with a second
layer so you can build it and you can
use quite a bit you just have to really
build this out and I feel it is sticky
so you definitely like some of it came
off on my hand so if you guys can see
that it's sticky you're definitely going
to have to set this we're should move on
to concealer and then we'll set this
with a powder that we got from them as
well so I got two colors this is the got
it covered a sponge applicator concealer
a fawn and she'll there spawn right
there they come out with a sponge pretty
easily so you don't have to really press
too much she'll is more yellow fawn is
more of a peachy tone down the side I'm
going to go with this one so it comes
out pretty easily like that a lot I'm
just going to do this like I normally do
my concealer
I know what the Senate but I can really
smell like right underneath my nose and
I'm going to need my L'Oreal sponge just
to blend this yes okay oh okay
I lost my cake in baked sponge and I'm
really wishing ahead right now I don't
know where the heck it went same with my
Smashbox photo finish primer it's
actually a nice full coverage concealer
whoo I like that color too again the
color I use with shell electrolyte is
the community favorite wow that brand us
up really concealed everything that's
good look at that scene I don't feel as
self-conscious about the foundation
because the concealer just made it look
better so much better okay so we're
going to go ahead and set the concealer
and the foundation remember I am setting
the foundation on the rest of my face as
well so I'm just going to bake
underneath my eyes in the center of my
face and then when I dust it away I'm
going to dust it all over my face just
to make sure we set everything so I'm
going to be using the Rays that go a
matte translucent finishing powder
that's from the same brand this is true
translucent I believe they have two
shades I could be wrong but I'm pretty
sure you can see how fine this powder is
because I'm packing on powder but it
doesn't look like it which you know I
think overall is enough so we're going
to go ahead and let that bake and I'm
going to finish my eyebrows I'm also
going to put on some false lashes and
then I will be right back and we'll try
out the rest of the makeup at that I
bought from them okay guys so we're back
and now I'm going to go ahead and dust
away the baking so I'm just going to use
this toothpaste brush and I've been
looking but face makeup is looking
really nice and smooth right now um so
you guys can see okay it is kind of
breaking up right here my nose all of
you guys can see that line you see this
area why is it and I really have no idea
why I'm doing that but oh my gosh it's
getting worse no next we're using this
tan time bronzer this is in the shade
light/medium this little like I feel
like it's very dark for a light medium
and it is more of a red toned bronzer so
just keep that in mind when you're
looking into this I'm going to go ahead
and just use this Sonia cash
brush that have been really loving I
like that pretty precise and fluffy so I
don't get too harsh of a bronzer so I'm
just going to dust this temple normally
I don't like red toned bronzer but we're
going to see how I feel today I think
this is really pretty I mean it's a
really nice like a natural looking color
I really like this I honestly didn't
think I feel like it cuz it look so like
red in the pan I'm filling in the now
I'm going to contour with that you're
going to see how this looks again
normally I don't contour with red ones
but Sophie got today so I'm just gonna
contour cheek cool I like it so these
are the blush crush the lushes and I
have two different shades
I have Drake oh yeah I forgot Drake and
Justin these are like named after
singers like Collins you know so OH
first such a big case the blushes are
tiny do you see that look out like the
dome doesn't even go above the pan like
hell that just did Drake we're going to
be using drink today
so does have a little bit of shimmer in
it
I think the colors really pretty but I'm
not accessible so this is not my
favorite but it's not terrible I don't
know just nothing it doesn't like the
color is really pretty but it's nothing
crazy cool and again there's like the
biggest packaging ever but I mean I like
the mirror oh no I like the mirror and I
like the product packaging is just too
big and it's kind of deceiving now we're
going in with the shimmer squad
four-piece powder highlight quad this is
the front what's the same as the box and
then this is the inside very pretty
we're probably going with like this one
right here these look really shimmery
and then they are whoa
I didn't it back in I'm just blending
out what's on there Wow okay I mean this
looks like I use this one right here but
I used this one honestly it's really not
emphasizing texture that bad with how
glittery not glitter it's just how
simmering it is I realize this I just
think it was unlike the formula but
actually very critics are the shades in
the palette you are more fair you're
probably going to really like this color
okay moving on I am going to put their
liner this is the a.m. 2 p.m. a Kohl
liner in black actually is this on my
upper waterline before I put on my soft
lashes and so far it's like super creamy
so notice whoa that is so black I mean
the liner today is incredible absolutely
incredible I'm just going to go ahead
and take the dark shade right here and
I'm going to use a pencil brush I'm just
going to rest this underneath my lower
lashes just to blend everything out I
will say you need to make sure you get
that liner on your waterline and not too
far underneath your lower lashes like
not even the littlest amount because it
will blend down which is nice it looks
really good but if you don't want a lot
of black underneath your
lower lashes make sure you really
concentrate on that waterline or else it
is going to blend down here with the
rest of your shadow I got two different
types of lip products I have two lip
kits we have the shade fleek and then
today so we also have this Gossip Girl
full coverage gloss in AB a friend which
I really want to use this one okay so on
the back I have my hair down and
everything is unwrapped we only have one
issue when I was in wrapping everything
and in this slay all day lip kit comes
with a lip liner in the liquid lip but I
did not get a liner I just got the
liquid lip which is a new shade hey BAE
don't know the liner came with this one
that's kind of a bummer this is the
shape right here you can see it is a bit
sheer so maybe with the lip liner
underneath it wouldn't be so bad is the
lip liner liquid lip combo in the shade
fleet which is really pretty it's so
smooth and it feels moisturizing feels
like a high-end lip liner I feel like
the liquid free shear and maybe that's
why you really need the lip liner it's
not a dry matte but it is definitely
drying down now and I feel like it's
going to last all day long this makeup
look is very very pretty and it's
affordable and everything that I tried
there's only two things there's one
thing that I don't like and another
thing that is kind of like on the fence
and it's just going to go up to you if
you want to buy it or not so the thing
that I'm not that impressed with is this
all about that base full coverage matte
foundation I feel like I am going to do
an update at the end of this video so
just stay tuned because I think I'm
going to I know I don't know I feel like
just already breaking up on my nose and
it's not as mat as I thought it would be
I know it's the stick foundation and
normally most dicks on Dacians aren't
going to be super mad I'm not that
impressed by this and on the first go
around it was not full covered you
definitely do have to build this up and
recommend a dense flat top brush because
I did use a different flat top brush
that isn't as dense as my if cosmetic
one and this just didn't want to blend
it as well so I recommend a dense flat
top brush if you want to try this out it
is pretty good but not my favorite and
then
I'm saying that I'm like on the fence
about an injury up to you I mean I
really like it I think it looks really
pretty what I'm talking about is this
eyeshadow palette I really like it I'm
personally going to keep it but if
you're wanting these darker shades to be
really really intense you're not going
to get that with this palette you are
going to have to build it up you could
always go in with the eyeliner that we
used and put it in the outer corner and
blend it out because the does blend out
really beautifully if you wanted
something that was more intense like
that but these are deep but they're not
super intense deep shades which I wish
these were a little bit more pigmented
just a little bit richer but that's okay
because I still love the rest of the
palette I think these shimmer shades
definitely pop with a glitter glue again
like I said NYX does have one you could
try out so right now it is 1224 and then
I test these out for the day and I'm
actually going to come back and give you
guys an update because I'm interested to
see how this wears and I know a lot of
you are too so we're just going to throw
this into a wear test as well why not
right I'm doing it for you guys because
I know you probably want to know what I
think without having to look in the
comments for the pins comment because
you guys know most the time I have a pin
comment keeping you updated I'm not
going to do check-ins I will come back
at the very end of the day before I take
off my makeup and let you guys know what
I think and how it wore and you'll see
how it wears on my face I will see you
guys in just a few but for me it'll be
like hours from now
hours from now hey guys so I am back and
right now is around 8 o'clock exactly
and I'm ready to take all this makeup
because I want to go to the gym I need
to upload this video so I'm ready to
kind of wrap this up and it's been on
for quite a few hours now so if you're
going to give you guys an update on the
product so first off the foundation
doesn't look as bad as I thought it
would I for sure thought it would break
up a lot more than it did right now it's
just breaking up here on my forehead
also on my nose area and I am pretty
oily I have blood in my face today with
tissue but I have not powdered or
anything so this is just the shine that
keeps coming through I don't think it
matters really well like it doesn't keep
it super matte I don't think this is
absolutely terrible I mean if this is
the worst that it's going to get it's
really not that bad it's still just not
my favorite foundation like I wouldn't
continue to use it I wouldn't
just because I like other drugstore
foundations that don't break up on me
and that lasts a little bit longer and
don't make me ask
oily and if you want to check out those
drum store foundations I will have that
video link to down below because I just
did an updated version on my favorite
eyeshadow stay in place this liner is
staying it did not run on the corners of
my eyes that usually happens with me all
the time but I did not have to touch up
my outer corners with anything the black
eyeliner is here to stay like look at
how intense it is on my waterline I have
not touched it up and done anything it
is literally just staying put my blown
liquid liner looking amazing
I think the blush the highlight is
looking really great as well the lip
color did wear off I was supposed to
take it with me when I went out shopping
no shopping but I ran some errands and I
didn't this is after eating and drinking
I think it could be a lot worse but I
will say I will continue to use that
color and that lip pencil because I love
the formula of it it drives down that
but it is not drying whatsoever like
when you think of a liquid layer you
probably think of like dry lips but then
when someone says it's not dry and you
probably think okay maybe not - you know
I'm not kidding this is such a cushiony
cushiony another host it it's a
comfortable matte feeling like it's
something that you don't feel on your
lips it doesn't feel like it's pulling
it doesn't stick when you close your
mouth it is a great formula and I really
really enjoyed wearing it so if I had it
with me and I knew where it was I would
continue to reapply it but I can't find
it right now and I'm about to take off
my makeup so doesn't even matter we know
what you guys think in the comments
below if you're going to try anything
out I want to hear your thoughts down
below I will give this line a two thumbs
up I think it's a great line I think
they have some awesome product there
really wasn't anything that is a
completeness that I absolutely hate it
there's just one thing that I wouldn't
want to use again and there's one thing
that's kind of iffy depending on what
you want to buy you want I'm saying so I
like this brand I think they got some
bomb-ass product for really great prices
highly recommend checking them out if
you want to know all the products I use
again it will be down below in the
description box and thank you very so

late upload
