all about the new Ulta matte lip creams
I featured these in my haul the other
day and I told you guys I wanted to do a
lip swatch video and you guys were all
about it so I made sure I did that for
you today I did swatches and everything
I don't know if I'm going to clue them
in the beginning or the end probably the
end because there's not much that I want
to say about them I kind of want to just
hit the bullet points and get to the
swatches so this video isn't like super
long and kind of dragged out for you
there are nine shades and they are nine
dollars a piece and the shades range
from a nice nude to super dark vampy
colors
the color that I don't have is another
vampy color like this but it's a really
dark purple and I wanted it so bad but
they didn't have it in stock when I was
there but then but you go from just like
a really pretty new to really vampy
colors like that so I feel like they
have a really good color selection and
there's something in there for everybody
now I want to say that when I first got
these and put them on I was like okay
these are not matte like they're not
drying they're really really creamy but
they're not drying our lips so when you
first put on this lip product I say it
takes about 15 minutes to dry which is
quite a while it is it's it's just a
while for it to dry and be completely
matte like this but once it dries it
stays on your lips forever like forever
I have been wearing this nude one with a
lip liner that I got from Ulta recently
too I will leave it down below because I
can't remember off the top of my head
and I've been loving it it's so long
wearing and I love the way that these
wear throughout the day because whenever
I use my Kat Von D Lolita sometimes when
it starts to go throughout the day it
starts breaking up and looking really
dry and gross on the lips and these do
not do that on my lips at all like when
they fade they just kind of fade evenly
and nothing looks disgusting when I use
the lip liner and that nude color it
takes honestly about I would say five or
six hours for me to have to go back and
be like okay I need to touch up my lip
color so that's really good it stays on
really well when you're eating and
drinking just the only downside is it
takes a few minutes to dry it like about
15 minutes I was timing it and it took
about 15 minutes to dry so I think that
they're a great deal though there are
much more liquid lipstick
out there that are met that are more
expensive and I feel like if you kind of
want to dabble into the matte lip colors
and the liquid lipsticks this is a great
way to go and they don't have like a
smell or anything no they don't really
have a smell or anything and they're
very very creamy and pigmented you'll
see in the swatches that I show you on
this video like they're insane I do
recommend the lip liner with them though
like that's my favorite way to use them
you can also like switch up the colors
really easily with lip liners and
there's a lot of great drugstore lip
liners that you could choose so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope
it was helpful and if you do like these
