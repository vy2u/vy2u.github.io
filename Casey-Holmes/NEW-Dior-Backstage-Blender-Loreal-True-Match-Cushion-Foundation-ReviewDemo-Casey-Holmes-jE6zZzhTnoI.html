video for you that is including this
back shaved blender from Dior this is
new I believe it just came out not too
long ago and I got mine off of the
Nordstrom but I'm going to be doing a
first impression on this and then a
review on the L'Oreal Lumi cushion
because I have used this a few times and
I want to give you my review and let you
guys know what I think about this
product so hopefully you can hear my
dryer probably can't hold on I lift up
any reviews on this but I want to see
how much the Beauty Blender is like the
regular Beauty Blender the pink one okay
20 bucks so this is the exact same price
as the Beauty Blender it's $20 and I
haven't seen any reviews on this or
anything I literally was tagged in a
picture with it on Instagram I just
wanted to check it out and see what it's
all about so this is a professional
finish fluid a foundation sponge so it
comes in a little thing like this looks
like a little egg and then has some
instruction so this is what the blender
looks like it has a flat side right here
and then it's more round but it feels
pretty dense right now feels like a nice
little sponge but I love the fact that
it has that in so you could do like
under-eye concealer and then do this is
kind of like the Real Techniques sponge
shape wise since we've already talked
about it I'm going to go ahead and wet
this and it get nice and damp and
squeeze all the water out and come back
and show you guys this and how this
works so on pump you know what I just
thought of I probably should see if
you're even suppose to wet the blender
because some people don't like to do
that so application tips it's not saying
anything about dampening the sponge or
putting it under water it just says
deposit the foundation on the back of
hand I'm not going to do that because
it's in this thing so just keep it in
that then it says take the polishing
side which is the flat side and smooth
on the skin and use horizontal strokes
to draw the foundation from the center
of the face outwards okay and then it
says use the rounded or gripping part of
the sponge and tap lightly to adjust
coverage and obtain flawless correction
then with the precision tip of sponge
apply to hard-to-reach areas bubble
block I'm going to take this L'Oreal
Lumi cushion the shade I mean
using is n35 it's a little life for me
whenever I am nice and self-tan but my
self-tans kind of faded so it should be
good to go and real quick my hair is not
green it is the lighting who is this
done out I kind of can't all right
please open these bad boys up yeah I've
been waiting to do that it does come
with this little sponge I don't like
this sponge just to be honest with you I
think it's more difficult to apply it
that way I like to use a sponge like a
Beauty Blender I like to apply it with a
Beauty Blender and not this because it's
just too stiff and just difficult to
work with but then you have this little
section right here you open up and
there's like a little sponge with the
foundation and then there's a mirror so
I'm going to take the this end like it
says and dip it into the foundation and
then do horizontal strokes this
foundation is a light coverage
foundation but I find that when you use
a Beauty Blender or something it just
looks a lot better feel like with this
Beauty Blender from Dior it's a little
lighter coverage too because you're like
just swiping it on your face and you're
using more product but this foundation
is also buildable so you can see some
redness picking through my rosacea if
you're new to my channel I do have
rosacea this sponge is a little more
dense than or it's a lot more dense than
the Beauty Blender but I do feel like
the original Beauty Blender provides
more coverage foundation looks good too
I really like this foundation I'm going
to do like a full review after I apply
all this but what I'm going to do is I'm
going to try this end dip it into the
foundation this is a white Beauty
Blender or sponge so it does get a
little um it looks really messy
I just want to tap it and see how that
works so you can see I covered a little
bit more instead of just swiping it
I think I might even like this for full
coverage foundations that I want to
cheer out and not have such an intense
coverage you know so this side of the
face is more dabbing and this side is
not you can see there's a little bit
more redness here than there is over
here I have used quite a bit of this
foundation or trying this thing out it
just kind of it's like soaking up a lot
of the product in my opinion this Dior
backstage Blender I feel like takes a
lot more time than the regular Beauty
Blender in my opinion just because it's
not so you know fluffy and bouncy and I
did what this and this says it doesn't
say to wet it it doesn't feel any
different wet than it does dry like it
doesn't feel any different between the
two this foundation is beautiful you can
see it does give a luminous glow now I
am very oily so of course when I got
this foundation I was like ah I don't
know if I'm gonna like that but I really
like it for earrings and things like
that if I'm going out and I want a full
coverage finish I won't use this but any
other day of the week if I don't want to
use my high-end foundation if I'm
literally going out the door just to
like run some errands I will use this
and I don't think I'll be able to use
this in the summer time because that's
when I get super oily but right now
since it's more the colder months I do
really like it I love the packaging when
you close it don't just like tap it like
that make sure you close it all the way
around and then it's sealed so nothing
leaks out nothing dries out anything
like that
and I do like this concept of foundation
works in the sponge and you kind of pull
it out because you can use it with a
brush or whatever now I have used this
foundation with a brush there's a lot
more sheer so again my favorite way to
apply it is with a sponge does just for
me this is also 0.51 ounces which is not
even a full ounce of foundation not even
close so that kind of sucks because this
is pricey I'll put the price right up
here but I really do like the coverage
and I do like it for a day-to-day
foundational I do have to touch up with
it I do it a little bit shiny here and
here but it just looks so good on the
face that I'm okay with that and it
lasted all day on me I had actually
applied this the other day at 11 o'clock
in the morning and it lasted all the way
to midnight
because you know girl don't go to bed in
10 o'clock vital acid till midnight and
it still looked really flawless and
really beautiful on the skin it just
looks like skin and it's not too
luminous you can set it with a powder if
you're oily if you're dry I would leave
it as it is because I think it looks
great but for me I have to set with a
powder or else it's just going to move
like right now the way my skin looks I
like it it doesn't look oily or greasy
it just looks like a dewy glow but on
your skin it doesn't feel like that it
just feels really nice it kind of does
feel tacky right now because I haven't
said it or anything but once I said it
just feels like a velvety smooth
foundation and I was really surprised at
the longevity of this I just I think
it's a really good product and normally
when things say luminous I'm not a big
fan but this this is good I really do
like it so now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to apply a concealer and this
is just the concealer that I have been
using well actually not always so I use
this concealer the other day and I
really liked it it's the Maybelline
master conceal and this stuff is nice I
really do like it the color I am in is
30 light medium also I did have some
breakouts the other day and the
foundation really didn't cover it that
well so if you have a lot to cover you
might not like this you would have to
add some extra concealer okay so that is
foundation concealer on using the Dior
back stage blender and then also be
using the foundation the L'Oreal Lumi
cushion and I like the way my skin looks
I am going to set it just because like I
said I have really oily skin and if I
don't going to go everywhere so I'm
going to set everything and finish off
my face and then I'll be right back to
give you guys a final review on these
products okay so final reviews on these
two I'm going to start with the Dior
back stage blender now this was twenty
dollars so it's exam exact price as the
regular Beauty blenders and to be honest
I thought it was kind of gonna be the
same exact thing is going bouncy this
would be easy to work with and it was
definitely a lot more dense it was
completely different than what I thought
it was going to be
ended up blending everything really
nicely but I liked it better when I pat
the foundation in then wiping the
foundation on my face now I'm gonna have
to try with like a more full coverage
foundation to see if I like it you know
dragging it along the face but usually I
don't like that kind of method I mean
some people do but it's usually not my
favorite just because I do have a little
bit to cover up but all in all I did
like this if you're a big fan of the
beauty blender and how it's just bouncy
and easy to work with on the skin you
might not like this but if you like your
Beauty Blender dry you would probably
like this product as well so if you like
that more dense dry feeling with your
beauty blender
I would check this one out if you don't
then you might not like this it might
not be your favorite okay now for this
foundation this again is the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi cushion and I do like it
like I said I like it better with a
Beauty Blender instead of a brush or the
sponge that it comes with I just feel
like it blends it a lot better I have
used this a couple times and I really
liked it every time but I probably won't
be able to use it in the summer time
because they'll be so hot I'm sweating
and it probably just won't stay on my
face as long and one other thing is I
used a different kabuki brush today I
use my Mac one that Rose tore up and
probably have to throw it away because
it's just shedding so bad but I washed
it and now it's just like shedding like
crazy but I use that to apply some
bronzer and I realized it started like
rubbing the foundation away I don't know
if it's because of the bristles or that
it's a little more dense but it just
kind of rubbed the foundation off so I
had to go in and Pat a little more on my
cheeks because my rosacea was you know
coming through so just be careful about
that I don't know if it's because I have
oily skin or what but I did set it
before I applied bronzer and it just
like moved or so bad around my cheek
area and I do like to set it with his
Maybelline master fix this is the
setting and perfecting loose powder I
set my whole face of this when I use
this foundation and even if I don't want
to apply like bronzer and blush and
stuff like that I would still use this
because it just looks so great on the
skin and I feel like it's just a
beautiful foundation and I feel like if
you're normal to dry you would really
like this as well and if you're oily
don't stray away from it definitely try
it out I think it's worth it I didn't
apply
oh I forgot to do that but I've used it
with the covergirl the new covergirl
primer for oily skin I liked it I also
use it with my high-end primers and I
liked it as well
and I have no primer on so hopefully I
like it as well but I did apply really
nicely without primers if you are
wondering I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope it was helpful for you if
you do like it then don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and leave a comment down
below if you've tried this foundation if
you liked it what's your skin type I
want to know like your tricks and
anything like that and if you've tried
this let me know as well and just tell
me how you like these things because
everybody has different opinions so it's
great to hear from different people and
