today I'm going to be reviewing the
newest drugstore sponges that I've
gotten my hands on I have three from
L'Oreal one from NYX and one from Revlon
also be on the lookout this week I'm
going to be doing another foundation
review kind of like I did with the
L'Oreal ones I'm going to do it on this
wet and wild photos focus foundation so
stay tuned guys these are going to be up
on Tuesday or Thursday I haven't decided
which day yet but I've had mixed reviews
about it and I'm going to take you guys
along through my day and I'm going to
show you how this works so stay tuned
for that video this week our mother
excited about it also don't forget to
subscribe to my channel there will be a
button down below underneath this video
and I also have a link in the
description box I'll be the first one
that you see and you can also hit that
Bell right beside the subscribe button
and that will be notified every time I
upload a new video so yeah let's go
ahead and get into the video and
demonstrate some of these sponges for
you guys okay so I have a couple of
favorites now the first thing I will say
is I have tried a couple of these dry
and I do not like dry sponges actually
tried these two when they were
completely dried they're actually damp
right now but I did not like them dry I
don't know where it is it might just be
me but I do not like sponges to be dry
when I'm blending out to my products I
feel like when they're a little bit damp
it helps everything blend out a little
bit easier and quicker so I'm just going
to go ahead and say I prefer these wet
at least this one this is my favorite
right now this is the L'Oreal sponge and
I love this for foundation and concealer
because you can blend out foundation
with this and then you can seal it with
this and you're good I really am liking
this so far which I'm going to show you
that in the video but these two I
haven't tried them since I tried them
dry my first impressions of them were
not good at all but I'm going to try
them one more time for you guys on
camera just to see if I like them when
they're a little bit more wet so that's
what we're going to do also I'm not
going to demonstrate this one but I
figured I was talking about it first
this is the mixed beauty sponge and I
really like this a lot I think this is
such a great sponge now this one is a
little bit more dense than this L'Oreal
when this L'Oreal definitely has a
little bit more bounce and a little bit
softer on the skin but this is still a
really great product I love the fact
that you have this flat edge right here
and then this rounded edge so you could
again do foundation and go in with
concealer you can also
out your contour I think this is a
really great sponge and I definitely
think it's worth the money so since I
have some other fundus I'm going to be
showing to you guys today I figured I
would just include this one let you know
it's good you could see it's been well
loved it's a great product these L'Oreal
sponges - after I put them under water
they got so big I'm telling this is a
huge-ass
sponge it's huge all of these got super
super big and I was really surprised by
that I mean they get a lot bigger than
the movie blender foundation I'm going
to be using it today is the wet and wild
photo focus foundation in golden beige
and I'm using this because right now I
don't have like in-between color that's
working for me I don't really feel like
mixing my Sonia Kashuk foundations I'm
also going to show you guys a cream
contour as I'm working from wet and wild
that I tried by the way none of my stuff
is sponsored by them I bought everything
if you didn't do that drugstore all I
had a huge-ass receipt because I know
I've been doing a lot of drugstore
videos that's because I spent like five
hundred dollars at the drugstore so I
need to do videos all messed up okay so
I'm going to take this L'Oreal sponge
this is $7.99 and I found this at my
local Walgreens before I found a lot of
this stuff I'm going to go ahead and use
the bottom I'm sorry all my sponges are
dirty but I've been using most of them
so I'm just going to go ahead and tap
this in now this feels pretty much like
a Beauty Blender it is so soft and since
it is a little bit damp it's kind of
cooling on the skin and I feel like this
blends out everything just as well as
the Beauty Blender it is so nice and I
love the fact that this tip on the end
is pointed so you can get underneath
your eye and has such a bigger end and
it takes pretty much no time to blend
out your foundation it is just awesome
and I don't know about you guys but a
lot of the time depending on the
foundation sponges will give me more
coverage than a foundation brush unless
I notice if I'm just soaking up too much
product and all that so you can see for
yourself right there it took me honestly
not long at all to blend all of that out
I really like the effect I mean it's
literally the exact same as a Beauty
Blender it's crazy how some of these
drugstore brands are coming out with
things that you can buy instead of
spending it on the bee blender even
though I do love these Beauty blunder
pro ones oh so good it's just amazing
but if you don't want to spend money
drugstore I have some options for you
and they are they're coming in full
force
so now
you guys concealer this is the
foundation concealer combo I've been
doing a lot recently and since I have
been trying to step out and I love this
concealer
it's the Maybelline better skin
concealer has been using for a while I'm
going to shade light right now I'm going
to take the pointed in sometimes I do
like to pinch it a little bit just
depends on when I'm doing and we're just
going to go in and blend it out I highly
recommend it obviously you can tell by
me putting all this in my face it's
pulling it out perfectly it's soaking up
any excess product that does not need to
be on my face so we don't have cake base
kind of doing like a current foundation
routine right now / let me see how these
awesome products words but this one if I
can recommend anything right off the bat
it would be this one the next one is
really good too but if you don't like a
sponge that's a little bit more dense
and you would want to go with the
L'Oreal one me I like to experiment with
all of them I love all kinds of sponges
I love the Real Techniques Diamond
sponge I love what's another one the
Sephora brand once it really good I love
experimenting with all of them you know
what I mean you can see it was got our
foundation and concealer blended on
pretty much flawlessly thing just does
so quickly I love it this is great to
bake with which I'll show you guys turn
a little bit but now I'm going to show
you guys cream contouring now I use this
yesterday and I really did like it and
it lasted all day long this is kind of
what I used as my base for my contour
that way my contour lasts all day long
this is the wet and wild mega cushion at
contour and I have not tried the
highlighter yet I've only tried the
contour and I was really nervous to test
it out to be quite honest with you but I
really enjoy it I think it's awesome and
to me it blended out really well on my
face pretty sure they only have one
shade this is the cafe Oh Slade I don't
know and it came up with a sponge but I
felt that and then it has this little
overlay on top and then you have the
cushion product now I don't know if I
should get rid of this or not I'm not
getting rid of it right now just in case
because I'm not sure it comes with it so
I would probably keep it now I did try
to use this yesterday and the problem
that I have with it is it is so stinkin
big and the directions say apply a small
amount of contour or highlighter on to
blender and draw lines around the nose
cheekbones and jaw lines and then blend
contour lines and circular motion I just
I don't know how I feel about that
I'm going to do it on one side of my
face and show you guys problem is it's
so sick and you want to get your contour
line really sharp we're just going to do
that one more time and see how it works
out because all I want is just like a
line and then it's just to blend in
circular motions I just feel like you
can't control that there's just
something about this I don't think it's
super practical I mean I see where
they're going with it but look at how
thick that guy you know and I mean I'm
not the biggest fan of it
so I would probably skip on that that
one is $7.99 as well but it's not you
know it's not my favorite it just kind
of makes it look sloppy thick so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take
this one this is actually for concealer
but since I love this little foundation
and concealer I'm going to try it for
contour so I'm going to put this into
the sponge instead so this is a little
bit smaller it might be a little bit
better I haven't tried this before first
time I'm trying it and we're just going
to go a line see there's just something
about using these sponges that I'm the
biggest fan of for a contour especially
that neon yellow green one it's just not
my favorite I mean maybe this would even
be gratefull foundation or something if
you kind of like that shape this one I
wasn't a big fan of it when I blended
out my concealer but maybe wet it would
be really nice I just know for me I like
to have a two in one product over just
one so I like this one the best for
concealer and foundation you know if
you're just trying to pick one but you
can use this to blend out your concealer
if you wanted to what I'm actually going
to do is I'm going to apply this with a
brush and I'm going to use this one buy
more feet the m-52 9 just going to
dabble it into the product I'm going to
use this to contour my forehead so what
I'm going to do I'm just going to buff
it around my forehead and another thing
I really like about this product is the
color the color looks so natural and it
doesn't look orange or too ashy now if
you're really really fair this might be
too dark for you unless you went in with
a super light hand I would probably pass
on this but I think if you have a little
bit of color I think
you would really like this because you
can build it up to be dark now when I
use this with a brush yesterday it
blended out so well I think since I
waited too long to let it dry might be
too much I'm going to kind of use my
sponge I use a foundation and just tap
it out I tend to do that a lot with
cream products if I use cream products
is very rare that I do do use cream
products I always use the blender that I
use for my foundation and just tap it
out make sure it's nice and blended
first like for me with this cream
contour I would say go in with a brush
blend it out and then if you have to
just take your beauty blender and blend
it out even work that it eventually does
blend out you want to mean like you
could see right there and this is kind
of like my base for the rest of my
contour that I'm going to do on the face
you can see it does give you that
natural contoured look to your face and
I really really like that so I'm going
to set everything with my flower Beauty
powder and again I'm going to take that
L'Oreal sponge
okay so while my face basem in finish
the rest of my face makeup and then I'll
be back to give you guys my final a
thoughts on it these sponges okay set
finish there's my face I did go with a
more kind of natural look today I didn't
so i doing false lashes or anything so
i'm going to tell you really quickly
website on my say to contour i just add
a little bit extra contour right on top
you can see whoo right on top I did use
the essence to shape your face
contouring palette I believe this is new
from them I'm not sure so about the
contouring this I do like this little
highlight it's not necessarily like a
blinding highlight but it's a matte
highlight you use it to carve out your
contour if you want to not the biggest
fan of the blush but this pant is the
biggest it's the contour so I mean it's
kind of worth it for me but yeah I've
been really liking this lately that I do
have on this Revlon tickled pink blush
this is one of the newest ones that I
showed in my haul so I have this on so
very light colored blush and then I do
have on the Wet n Wild mega slow
highlighting powder in the shade
precious petal and for mascara I have
the wet and wild last renegade and then
for my lips I do have on the wet wild
gel lip liner in it bears comment I love
these a gel lip liners they are
absolutely amazing they're so creamy
they could be a lip color on their own
but I did top it off with the wet wild
liquid cat suit in the shade and nudist
peach so I'm going with interestings up
for you guys and let you know my final
thoughts
obviously as most of you know I
absolutely love this L'Oreal sighs I
think it's amazing 100% worth the eight
dollars that you will spend on it it's
awesome highly recommended as well as
the next line I forget how much is the
next one oh so this is eight dollars as
well it's the only it's online only at
Ulta and it's the access flawless
finished fun like I said this one's a
little bit more dense and this one's a
little bit bouncy so it's just going to
depend on what you want this one I guess
that I don't necessarily like it for
contouring for me personally I would
never use this to contour it's just too
thick I don't have enough control I
don't blend it out like I want to and it
is eight dollars as well but again you
could probably use this for foundation I
don't know it feels like it has a
different texture then the foundation
one so maybe not just one of those
things or if you want to try it
definitely try it out but to me it's too
damn big and
and this one is going to be all about
you what you like to apply your
foundation with you know all the tools
that you like to have when you're doing
this if you don't like using one tool as
like your foundation and concealer
blender you could totally pick this up
and use it to blend out your concealer
it's small and it gets right in there
and you could set your face with this if
you didn't want to bake a lot of your
face you can use this just to bake right
underneath the eyes again I do not like
any of these sponges dry but I do like
them underneath water pleasing out the
excess water and then using it with my
products this is kind of like those many
Beauty blenders where I knew if I bought
so many Beauty blenders I would never
use them because I don't I just don't I
can't pick that rule thing you'll
underneath mine but this is a little bit
bigger than that and I want to do just
like a quick little review of the wet
and wild mega cushion contour I do like
this I am going to keep it and I think I
am going to continue to use it as long
as I remember to not bake before I do
this because I would not put this over
powder I think it's all from the video
it does Drive pretty quickly so I would
use it with a brush I think that's the
easiest way to use this product I just
think it's worth it nothing is fun again
I have not tried the highlighter one yet
I'm a little nervous to try it but I
also stuff for you guys really soon but
this is a go for me as well I will
update you guys in a future video on
this Revlon sponge because I totally
forgot to demonstrate it in this video
but I will probably include it in my
hips and misses video so check that out
at the end of the month I will have it
all there and it did for this video you
