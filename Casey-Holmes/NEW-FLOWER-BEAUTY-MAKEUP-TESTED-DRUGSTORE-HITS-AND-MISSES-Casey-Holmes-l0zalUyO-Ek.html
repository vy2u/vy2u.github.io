be doing a where tests /a first
impression and trying these out on some
new flour beauty products and I'm so
excited I've been watching Ulta to see
when these items go live I've been
really pumped for this full coverage
concealer this was like what I had my
eye on the most but I did go ahead and
pick up the foundation a little this is
called tattoo effect brow stain this
palette right here and then also a
mascara so we're gonna put all this
stuff on see how it all wears if it's
good if it's not so I'm super-excited
try this stuff out if you're not
subscribed already be sure and hit that
subscribe button below so you don't miss
out on any videos so if you want to see
me try on all these new flower beauty
products then let's just go ahead and
get started okay so I'm gonna go ahead
and go into this beauty flash palette
from flower Beauty that this palette a
lot bigger than I thought it was going
to be it is 16.99 on the Ulta website or
you get three eyeshadows two blushes a
bronzer and a highlighter don't mind my
nails I'm gonna go ahead and just do my
eyes with this really quickly this one
looks like anything too crazy it just
looks like some basic colors great for
everyday something you could kind of
just travel with for easy looks and try
this out first and I'm gonna use like my
regular primers and stuff especially for
the foundation because I want to see how
it wears I'm lil nervous about it
because it's luminous makeup and just
looking into this pout there's nothing
to really set the entire eyelid with so
I'm just gonna go in with a face powder
this is the makeup revolution luxury of
baking powder and it's the lace one and
I'm just going to go in with a fluffy
brush and set that entire lid now I'm
going to go in with this middle shade
right here and just throw this into my
crease with that same brush this is a
Mac 2 40s this is how big it is it's
really really nice and I'm gonna go in
and fluff this into my crease it looks
like a nice transition shade really like
flower beauty products and have a few of
their eyeshadows and they're really nice
this would also be good to go to with
some of her eyeshadow palettes that she
already has next I'm going on the Mac
217 and that really deep brown on the
and and it's pretty pigmented does have
some kick up in the palate but nothing
too bad I mean this is a good everyday
palate if you're wanting to step outside
your comfort zone this isn't really that
palette for you but for people who just
want a simple palette to go to everyday
I think this is a really nice palette so
far the eyeshadows are blending really
well okay now I'm gonna take a Mac 242
and go into this shimmer shade right
here and I'm gonna put this all over my
lid right in here I feel like her other
shimmery shades from the other palettes
that I have from her are a little bit
more intense it's not like the smoothest
shadow she's ever had but it is pretty
that's what it looks like
I think it's nice it's good for the
palate the shimmery part of it kind of
blends away when you try to blend them
all together that shimmer shades nothing
crazy good I do feel like it kind of
dust away now I'm gonna do is move on to
mascara this is a new mascara from them
it's called lash warrior says explosive
volume and links it says 150 percent
fierce full blown volume a percent in
saw a dramatic thickness and 88 percent
saw extreme length so I got the fiercest
black I'm really excited to test this
out I mean it's in serious claims that's
so cute it's kind of like a little ombre
and it's matte it's very very nice let's
see what the wand looks like okay this
kind of gives me like covergirl
LashBlast volume vibes I love that
mascara but it has like a little bit of
a curve to it and you also have longer
bristles on the end to curl my lashes
because I always do that with any
mascara I'm hoping this really gives me
like lots of volume like if I'm going to
wear just mascara and no false lashes I
want a lot of volume I'm not really like
picky about length but volume a hundred
percent
okay so off the bat I'm seeing more
length and separation but we're going to
go in with our second coat
okay so that's after two dips into the
mascara again I think it's more like
lengthening and separating it has a
little bit of volume but I kind of
expected more because I have really
dramatic claims now I'm going in with
this light illusion luminous makeup a
nude skin feel all day wear foundation
has SPF 18 and this is a $13.99 and they
have 12 different shades I think I'm
gonna go in with soft sand because I'm
just a little bit more fair and I feel
like I could take this down my neck
easier do you love the packaging of this
it's a glass bottle it's really really
pretty you do get one fluid ounce and
it's just nice they have really good
packaging and it does come with a pump
so look at that it's just so nice that's
just like a really pretty bottle right
there I like that a lot
I promise you oh I need primer so
deprive I'm going to use my Smashbox
primer water and also my cane and Austin
a mattifying primer might actually go in
with classic tan because this one's just
looking really really warm and peachy
and this one's looking a little bit
better so I'm probably gonna go in with
classic tan instead okay so we are
primed and now I'm gonna go in with the
Sonia Kashuk sponge and classic tan yeah
this color looks like it'll be way
better so I'm gonna use the sponge on
this side
it's looking pretty good so far I'm glad
I went with this shade instead where I
need it like my nose okay so this is
very luminous as it says that it's going
to be so this sides with a sponge you
get pretty good coverage I would say
it's pretty much medium to full coverage
but now I'm going to use the it
cosmetics brushes for Ulta this one's
the airbrush full coverage complexion
brush okay I'm just gonna go over my
nose with the brush I do feel like I've
used quite a bit of product so far on my
face right now I'm just kind of pressing
in to make sure I get the most coverage
whoa we are luminous yeah I would say
medium to full coverage I don't know
what's that I like best I'm thinking the
brush side actually I'm thinking I like
the sponge side better I feel like it's
kind of sinking into my pores a little
bit on my brush side okay so we're gonna
move on from that and we will just have
to see how that wears throughout the day
because it's very intense I think if you
have dry skin you're gonna love it
because it is very dewy but for oily
skin I'm kind of on the fence right now
I'm a little nervous okay so now going
in with this concealer it's the flower
Beauty light illusion a full coverage
concealer it says weightless feel crease
proof and a softly angled tip for
precise application and yeah basically
it just says it's a soft focus blurring
concealer with high performance coverage
the weightless formula instantly
diminishes the appearance of
imperfection fine lines and size of
fatigue for a flawless luminous look our
creamy texture blends seamlessly like a
second skin with the visibly lightweight
feel so I got two shades I got the shade
light and also light/medium light/medium
is more of a like a tan so to highlight
I am going to use those underneath my
eyes so if you don't like to really
highlight underneath your eyes and your
kind of same skin tone as me I would
definitely go with light/medium it's not
gonna give you that really brightening
effect look so nice
and then that's applicator so I'm just
gonna go in and do it on normally doing
my concealers I do like that applicator
it is really precise I think it's nice
I'm gonna take this other Sonia Kashuk
sponge that I really really like this
actually comes in a pack of two and I
mentioned in my facebook live I really
love it so definitely check this out
again it's Tanya Kasia can get at Target
and we're gonna blend this out oh my
goodness this is looking really good
whoa okay this is looking really really
nice that just kind of blended really
seamlessly and it's like a matte it's
more of a matte concealer it's not super
dewy or anything like that of course you
can apply less this is just what I
normally do with my concealer because I
also try to cover up any redness that's
peeking through foundations
it doesn't feel heavy even though I
apply a lot of concealer it's definitely
a Mac concealer but it's not drying I am
the type of person where when it's
concealer I can always tell like right
off the bat I'm gonna love it or not at
least if I like it in general and so far
I think this is kind of your really
kickin sailor I get really excited about
face products working out very well okay
so now what I'm gonna do is set
everything with this makeup revolution
luxury baking powder lace so one of my
favorite powders recently and it does
have a little bit of a tint to it so it
will also help highlight underneath the
eyes even though we really don't need it
because that concealer did work also
gonna swatch the light medium for you
guys so you can see it even the
foundation like the foundation and
concealer combo right now are looking
really good together and I wasn't
nervous about the foundation so we'll
see how it lasts really I have to
exfoliate myself tan again tonight next
up I'm going in with a flower tattoo
effect brow stain says 12-hour wear
smudge proof and defining chisel tip Pro
application I got the
shade totus brow product is $9.99 it has
six reviews and only three stars so
let's see what the problem is so I'm
gonna take the Catrice fleet and just go
through my brows really quickly I'm
sorry I'm still feeling I I am feeling
like super sick as the days go on so I'm
hoping it gets better so this is what
the tip looks like it's pretty thin it's
very long and then it just kind of looks
like a marker so I'm just gonna go in
okay I think this is really nice so far
only concerned I'm having is I can't
really define my brows a lot like right
in here um because it's not dark enough
for me so I probably need a darker shade
okay so kind of figured out what I don't
like about it so I do like the marker
part I feel like you can really get in
here nicely and give yourself a good
brow this brow is my brow brow so I have
to fix her later thing I don't really
like about this is that the undertone is
like a red I don't even think you guys
can see that a Heatherette undertone to
it but it definitely does it's pretty it
kind of almost looks purple and I don't
think it's terrible I just think the
undertones a little bit different but
from far away you can't really tell so
now I'm gonna dust away the baking and
set the rest of my face okay we're
having some separation right here if you
guys can see that um what's going on so
I'm thinking you can't bake with this
product with the full coverage concealer
I think it's gonna be one of those
things where you just need to press in
the powder to set it but you can
definitely see where it's breaking up so
they have a bronzer in this face palette
it does look a little bit shimmery but
we're gonna try it out anyways
I don't think I like that bronzer and I
looks pretty good on the forehead though
so this one a little bit does go a long
way and even though it does have a
shimmer to it I do think it looks pretty
good on the skin don't hate it
especially on the forehead I really like
this one on the forehead looks very
natural and just like sunkissed in a way
now we're gonna go in with the blushes
there's two different blushes you have
one that's a little bit more peachy and
then this one which is a little bit more
moth um they are pretty small pan sizes
so it's actually had quite a bit of
payoff and I was going in with a really
light hand pretty they kinda have a glow
to them and then last not least in this
face palette I'm gonna use the
highlighter in here which is this one
right here okay it's nothing too intense
but you can build it up to get like a
pretty glow again I think this is more
of just like geared more towards
everyday people who just want an easy
makeup look to go to so now what I'm
gonna do is finish up the rest of my
face and then I'll be back to close this
out later guys know what time it is so
we can go ahead and wear this throughout
the day okay so this is what the makeup
is looking like so far so the really the
only complaint that I have is just to
not bake your concealer I also think the
bronzer is just a little too warm for me
but the eyeshadow looks really good I
think the face palette is pretty nice
it's good for just like a really quick
everyday look I did put the darker brown
underneath my lower lash line just kind
of blended it out and then put mascara
on my lower lashes as well and then for
lips I'm wearing this miracle matte lip
from them as well and this one's in the
shade bear honey so that's what I have
on my lips and yeah even though I do
have some of the makeup breaking up here
I am gonna wear it throughout the day
just see how it goes so I will check
back with you guys in just a little bit
right now it is 303 it's a little bit
later in the day but I will be wearing
this all day we've got some stuff to do
so I'm just gonna continue to wear this
and see how it looks throughout the day
and I'll check
back with you guys in it just a little
bit I don't know if you guys will be
able to hear me because the wind is so
crazy here but David said I should do an
update in the lighting hopefully they
can hear me with the so we just went
grocery shopping got some items loading
up now and the makeup laughing pretty
well I'm actually impressed with the
foundation so far it gives you like a
glow like once you said it but it's
nothing too crazy and it's lasting
pretty well so hopefully you can hear me
but so far so good and it is hey guys so
I am back and let's see it is 1139 now
I'm at 1% so I gotta gotta get through
this but I'm gonna share with you guys
what I think about this makeup as you
can tell or actually if you can but it's
definitely coming off here around my
brows and actually in the areas that the
concealer is not in there's a lot of
coverage here but then around it it's
just really breaking up really bad so
this is where I put the concealer and
you can see that and then around it
where I did put good sealer it's
breaking up it's breaking up here not
breaking up too bad around here it's
just mostly this area where I baked and
I just don't think you need to bake with
that concealer earlier we're at the
grocery store it looked really good like
my whole face makeup looked good but now
it's like my eye shadow is pretty much
almost gone my eyebrows they this one
looks okay this is my good brow and this
one just looks kind of wonky and then
the lip product is obviously gone for me
I feel like the foundation is something
I would go to if I'm just gonna go
outside and quickly run errands or
something and I just want to have my
face done but it's not something I would
rely on for a full day of wear a lot of
time with luminous foundations they'll
start breaking up on me because I do
have really oily skin so I'm not usually
surprised when it starts doing something
like this but then again it just shows
me like okay you don't want to wear this
for more than like six hours because
it'll just start breaking up and looking
crazy
so that's my we're test review on these
new products definitely let me know down

testing them out if you already have
