I have quite a bit of stuff to share

salty I got a little crazy mmm I know
but yeah don't forget to thumbs up and

the comment what your favorite thing was
for 2015 I would love to hear it right
now I'm on a drugstore binge I'm
actually trying a new drugstore
foundation out right now it's not
covering this bad boy up but that's okay
I really quickly I do want to address I
did to get my hair done all of you guys
can really tell I can really tell um I
did go a little bit lighter I did
foliage I went to a new girl if you want
to check it out and see her information
if you're in the Atlanta area and just
go check out my Instagram I have all her
stuff in a photo that I posted I have
her Instagram link and you can check it
out there so go and follow me on my
Instagram and Twitter if you're not
already and now I'm gonna be quiet so I
don't like this a long video and let's
just go ahead and get started okay so
the first thing I want to talk about is
this batiste dry shampoo this is for
dark brown hair or brown dark brown hair
and I love this I love the teeth I've
used the one without the tint I've used
so many of these I've used the blonde
one when I was blonde this year um I
just used of time and I really love this
brand I just keep going back to it you
can get at Walgreens Ulta just bunch of
different places and yeah I really like
it it's affordable and it really keeps
your hair looking refreshed for so long
it's amazing and then the last kind of
non makeup related thing is this loving
tan to our Express obsessed with this
this is how I state and if you can see
my legs right now I haven't tanned them
but I have a nice
contrast between my heart with my leg
but this stuff has been great this year
I think it's the only thing I used all
year long in 2015 and I really recommend
it this is a two-hour Express I used
this one last night and I also loved the
eight-hour one as well I did the coupon
code for you guys if you're interested
for like a little free gift I'll leave
all of this information in the
description box okay so first off let's
talk about primers and these two you've
got I mean you're gonna see a lot of
repetitive things that you've seen in a
bunch of videos but if you've never
checked out my videos these are the
things I love and use all the time so
these primers hands down where my
favorite primers of 2015 and in these
Smashbox primer water and pore minimizer
if you have oily skin larger pores in
this area most people with oily skin do
have kind of larger pores right here you
would love this this is just a great
combo these do not come together they
come separately but I like to spray the
primer water first and then put this
around this area I'm going to flake you
help and then put this around my pores
area just to minimize the look of them
and it works with every single
foundation I've used I love it with
drugs for high end it's hard for me to
stray away from these because they have
been absolutely amazing and then I get a
ton of questions about what I prime my
eyes with I've always primed my eyes if
I do not prime my eyes I have very oily
eyelids and any eyeshadow that I put on
without a primer will crease in like
five minutes it does not take long at
all so the primer that I swear by is
this NARS smudge proof eyeshadow base
and it is amazing you guys if you have
oily eyelids or just have a problem with
your eyeshadow creasing staying on all
day this is what you need in your life
it is worth every single penny I've gone
through three of these this year you
don't need a lot to cover your whole
eyelid and it is a clear primer so after
I put this on since it is translucent I
like to take a cream colored eyeshadow
and I will just put that on top and it
kind of evens everything out and then
you're good to go I love this make sure
it dries before you put any eyeshadow on
because it will be hard to blend but
that's with any primer all right let's
talk about foundations now I used to
really really love the Estee Lauder
Double Wear
that was all I used for so long I don't
even remember when I stopped but two
other foundations came into my life one
at the end of the year and one at the
beginning of the year and I want to
share them with you because I think
these two are my absolute favorites over
the estee lauder double wear so the Too
Faced Born This Way is the first one I
want to talk about this has a medium to
full coverage finish for me I like it
more full coverage I like to use my
makeup geek was it face buffer brush and
this is so good has a pump I mean it's
just amazing and the shame that I am in
in this like if I were to wear it right
now I would be in warm beige and they
have a ton of different colors I mean a
variety of colors and it wears so
beautifully on the skin it's just such a
great foundation it doesn't look too
cakey or anything like that so easy to
work with so this is one of my top
favorite foundations and the other one
is the Marc Jacobs remarkable foundation
this is so incredibly beautiful it's one
I've been using lately if I'm not
wearing a drugstore foundation it is so
pigmented such a full coverage
foundation like if I have any redness on
my face if I like have a irritated
pimple or something I put this on top
and you have no idea what's going on
underneath that foundation it is so full
coverage amazing if you have something
to cover up I have some rosacea here on
the center of my face this will cover up
everything for you I really recommend it
especially if you do have rosacea
because it will cover it up only
downside to this foundation is this
ordeal where it just has a stick and it
comes out and you put it on your face
that's the only problem and it gets a
little messy around the rim but honestly
I can get past it because I love this
foundation so much so full coverage it
lasts all night long and will not smudge
it was like it won't move it doesn't
break up on me it covers over my nose
perfectly it's just so good so
definitely check it out and then the
concealer that I want to talk about is
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
this is so amazing it just sits on the
skin really well it's lightweight it
covers up everything underneath my eyes
I don't have really intense dark circles
or anything but it really just brightens
up my face and belen
really beautifully especially with that
Marc Jacobs foundation such a great
combo okay so to set my concealer and
everything like that I've been using
contour palettes they're just easiest
and I love the yellow tone powders and
the contour palettes which is what I
like to set my concealer with so the
first one I'm going to talk about for
contour palette is the Marc Jacobs
Mirage filter this is number forty and I
love this you can tell I love that
yellow shades because we're running low
love this I don't really use this
contour shade as much so if they could
come out with this in a pan that would
be amazing but you know it's probably
not gonna happen but I really really
love this it's a really finely milled
powder it sets everything beautifully in
a brings up your face just enough you
can see like my brush indentions in here
I've used it quite a bit but it's not
something where I'm like oh let me use
that one right away because I want to
use something different but the yellow
powder in this is absolutely amazing and
then the other palette I've been loving
is the Kat Von D shade and light palette
this has another great yellow tone
powder in here you can see I put quite
an indention in that but the rest of
these fires are great too I normally use
this one to contour with just because I
like this tone better than the other
ones this one's too dark and this one is
just not one of my favorites so I like
to use these two right here really
really really great palette I don't know
if she's coming out with individuals of
these that would be awesome
this is a really good palette if you're
looking into buying one and then lastly
I want to talk about the powder to kind
of like set your face use it throughout
the day if your oily and my favorite has
been the Laura Mercier matte translucent
powder this is the one that I have been
using a lot for the past few months and
I love it you never see it in videos
because I always have it in my purse
because I use it when I'm out and about
and I need to touch up this is like my
go-to going out blotting powder I
absolutely love it it's beautiful again
really finely milled you can't tell it's
on your face just gives you a very
smooth appearance which is what we all
want
okay alright onto a my favorite part
which is the bronzers I have four that
have just been my everything these are
my everything i love bronzer the first
one is this girl on terra cotta bronzing
powder in number 5 thing about Garlon is
they are very very warm colors I
use this to contour I use it strictly
just to bronze my face because it is so
warm but I will tell you that this will
make you look like you just came back
from the beach if I'm kind of feeling
like a little too pale and need a
serious bronze I will use this one
because it just looks absolutely
stunning it blends so well and it gives
you this warm tan color and I I adore
this so incredibly much okay the next
one is this Smashbox suntan matte
bronzer first off I love the packaging
of this I love that it just twist off
but I adore this one again it is a warm
toned bronzer but it's not too warm like
the girl on it has a little bit of a sh
t tones in there as well so it's also
great to contour with I like to use this
one for bronzing and contouring is just
whatever I'm feeling for the day but you
get a ton of this and I've used this so
much and I'm so surprised I have not put
a bigger debt in it but I love this
bronzer as well very easy to blend again
so for another bronzer to make you look
like you just got back from Tahiti or
Bahamas or Boer War if you like me and
you're just dying to go to war Bora this
is the hourglass ambient radiant bronze
light and I love this it is so beautiful
on the skin it has just a really
gorgeous glow to it I I mean it's so
hard to explain you look at it and you
think there is no way that it's gonna
bronze my face but once you put this on
your face it is absolutely stunning
there's a little bit of shimmer in there
but you can't really see it normally I'm
not a shimmery bronzer kind of person
but oh my gosh I am NOT a huge fan of
the hourglass powder and I was wasn't
really expecting a lot from this bronzer
but it really really impressed me and it
is one of my absolute favorites and it's
a staple in my collection just because
it looks so stunning it's a warm bronzer
and it just glows on your skin okay and
then the last one to bronze my face with
is this one from V or it's the Dior new
tan in 0:03 again this one is a very
warm color but it just looks so pretty
on your face I mean all of these are
nice warm bronzers because I do strictly
use them other than the Smashbox one to
just warm up my skin if I need
little tan and the oh my gosh the mirror
is so dirty
oops I use it a little too much I like
about this is when I dip my brush in it
I don't have to be too cautious of using
too much of it like the girl on one is
so intense and a lot will get on your
brush and when you put on your face
you're gonna be like oh my god just put
way too much on and you'll have to like
blend away but with this one you know
you could just dip your brush in there
and not worry too much about it because
not too much product comes off into the
brush and it's easy to build up it's not
sheer by any means but it's not as
intense as a girl long one okay just a
couple more face products I want to talk
about blushes real quick I didn't really
pull out a lot of different blushes I
just pulled out the ones that I know I
love and the ones that I used completely
all year round and the first one is NARS
madly this one broke on me but I really
really love this color it goes with
every single look that I do and it
really helps warm up the skin it's just
beautiful you can use it by itself and
you don't even have to use a bronzer or
you can use it with the bronzer and just
look like a freaking goddess it's
amazing NARS lashes are awesome because
they're highly pigmented but yet they
blend beautifully so they look just
flawless and smooth on your skin that's
brand I want to talk about is Becca
blushes Becca blushes are intense very
very very very pigmented but if you put
too much on you can blend them out so my
favorites are songbird and damselfly for
the difference between these two is
songbird has more of an orange tint to
it
and damselfly kind of has like a pink
tint to it but they are absolutely
beautiful very smooth easy to work with
and you can blend like a champ would do
so this room out there is songbird I
love songbird I think it is beautiful
and then damselfly is a great everyday
blush with every single look it's just
stunning so that's it right there you
see has more of a pink tint to it okay
I'll do highlighters I'm going to
mention just a few first off the benefit
what's up is one of my favorites I
didn't think I would like it as much as
I do but it really looks flawless
on the skin and I like to use a more
dense brush with it because it picks up
more product and it really glows I don't
have it on right now I actually have a
drugstore one on it really glows on the
skin and it blends out so well and you
don't have to set it with
powder even if you are oily it is a
cream but it's more of a cream to powder
type of things so if you are oily you
can still use this and it'll look
flawless and stay on all day even if you
don't set it with a powder hey the other
one is Becca's opal oh I live for this
color this is one of my favourite
colours this was e first no way I got
moonstone first and then I got opal opal
is by far my favorite especially I hate
this hand on like a date night or a
candlelit dinner or if you're in the
club and the light said it it just looks
so good
opal is one of my favorites and then
Jaclyn Hills champagne pop is also a
favorite it's absolutely beautiful and
then the other highlight I'm gonna talk
about is this malli effortless airbrush
and this is the pure light highlighter
and oh my gosh
yeah that's not even like pressing down
hard this is such an intense golden
highlight and it looks absolutely
stunning on your face okay so now I'm
gonna shout out a couple brands for
eyeshadows only have three to shout out
just because these are ones that I know
I truly love and I feel like you should
spend your money on they're beautiful
they blend so well they're all very
pigmented and there's I have nothing and
negative to say about them so first
brand is makeup geek I love makeup geek
I have some of the shadows on right now
I think they're awesome they have a ton
of different colors a ton of different
finishes and they're pretty affordable
as well so makeup geek is the first
brand the second thing is this Smashbox
the shapematters palette this is just
one of my favorites I used it on one of
my best friends at her wedding I used it
in a holiday tutorial not too long ago
but this is a perfect kind of all in one
palette and it creates such beautiful
looks and I just I love every single
shade in this palette and I have I mean
I can't even speak because it's so
freakin good
Smashbox shapematters palette is one you
have to have I will link that holiday
video down below if you want to check it
out but it lasted all day on me and
lasts all day on one of my best friend's
last brain is morphe I love this 3/5 Oh
palette it just has all of the warm tone
shade
that I would ever want only thing
missing is a black but that's okay
but this palette is so beautiful I've
seen this everywhere
I mean people work having problems with
even getting it but morphe does have
really great eye shadows and I really
highly recommend them and they are
pretty affordable so Wow
all of my stuff is messy that's how you
know I like them oh right see I have two
eyeliners for you guys I think I
mentioned one of these less she gave me
favorites but I can't remember if you
need an amazing waterline black eyeliner
that will not smudge throughout the day
and that will last all day long
NARS will be your best friend this is
the larger than life long wear eyeliner
my liner will just get everywhere and it
will look like a raccoon if I'm not
careful this doesn't budge another
positive thing about it is you do not
have to sharpen it it is a twist up I
did it before and it completely ruined
the plastic around and it honestly lasts
so long on me and it's a product that I
can't stay away from I've tried many
different black eyeliners but this is
the one I always go back to you because
I hate when my eyeliner gets smudged
underneath here or anywhere I did not
put it it drives me insane and this does
last on my waterline a very long time
and then my liquid liner for the year
has definitely been this makeup forever
ink eyeliner this is a matte liquid
liner it has a felt tip and this is so
awesome it's really easy to work with it
is so intense and black I just love it
so much and I love this for a winged
liner because the tip stays pointy for a
really long time like I've never had an
issue with it being dull or kind of
losing its shape this is my favorite
liquid eyeliner hands-down okay so the
only mascara that I could think of that
I have been obsessed with is this
benefit roller lash this is great great
great great I love it
it really separates my lashes and it
gives me a ton of volume this with the
benefit they're real primer is oh my
gosh it is beautiful I mean it just
makes your lashes look like falsies it
looks so great but this on its own as
well does the same thing just not
dramatic but it gives you great volume
and it separates your lashes beautifully
and I love this I've gone through a
couple tubes of it already and I just I
can't get enough of it okay quickly to
talk about brows I want to shout out
this honest Asya dip brow I used the one
in dark brown
I loved it this past year it was really
easy to work with and I just had nothing
bad to say about it right now I'm not
wearing it I'm actually wearing a
drugstore product by Ardell that I
really think is a dupe for it but for
2015 I was loving the dip Brown I still
do love it if I want to use it and then
this I still use now even over the
Ardell this is the UH Nastasia I don't
even know you can't even see the name on
it anymore because I've rubbed it off it
looks so bad but this is the UH Nastasia
brow gel in brunette don't let the color
scare you I know it scared me but this
is an amazing product to blend into your
brows to help everything just like blend
together and look seamless I have it on
now and you wouldn't think that's it
this would work for my brows but it
definitely does is great keeps my brows
down all day and it kind of lightens
them up a little bit just so it goes
with the rest of my hair which I enjoy a
couple lashes the first one is the
Ardell double ups in 207 these are one
of my favorite lashes just look at them
they're beautiful like these are some
beautiful lashes so double up into a
sevens are when my face and another
brand I've been loving is Koko lashes
these I was using for I don't even know
how long because I was obsessed these
are the Koko lashes and goddess and they
are intense fluffy dramatic but they are
sexy like these are perfect for a really
dramatic smoky eye or something because
they make your eyes just look so sultry
and sexy highly recommend these these
are beautiful
and my lashes I'm wearing right now are
from house of lashes as well and they're
in the style Bella so you can't see in
there on my eyes right now but they're
really great they're little bit thicker
here in the middle and they're kind of
more wispy here on the outer parts and I
just think they're so fun I love House
of lashes at first I wasn't sure because
the band's a little bit thicker and
harder to work with but honestly once
you get used to it it's amazing and
their lash glue is a phenomenal
phenomenal
alright guys last thing is lips that's
what I'm going to talk about today so
the first one is kind of a given it is
Mac swirl I don't think anybody will
post a video without Mac swirl in it and
if they do it will be shocked so many
people love this color the lipliner the
lipstick I have the lipstick somewhere I
was trying to find it but I couldn't but
world is by far one of my favorites for
this year is just a ma B brown
absolutely gorgeous another lip liner
I've been loving is the Urban Decay
glide on pencil in 1993 so another great
nude this one has a little bit of mom in
it but it's not as muggy as well it's
just a great darker nude lip liner so if
your liquid lipsticks I just wanted to
mention one I've tried a bunch of
different liquid lipsticks but this one
is just like my favorites but my
favorite lip product of 2015 and I just
love it I think it's so great I love her
colors I love the formula everything
about this line and this color is just
beautiful is the cap on date lolita
liquid lipstick right when this started
becoming a thing I had to have it and I
went and picked it up and I've just been
in love ever since the formula can be a
little drive and I make sure to
moisturize and exfoliate before I put
these on but the color is what I'm in
love with I just absolutely love the
color and I did get Lolita 2 in the mail
and I can't wait to try that out but the
original Lolita is a my thing it's my
jam it's my shade this is my shade like
this is my perfect color and that's why
I'm only mentioning this one because I
really stand by it and I really feel
like this was my color for 2015 it was
just so beautiful and I enjoyed it so
much ok guys so that is it for my 2015
favorites I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video these are all of the price
I'm loving the brands everything I just
cannot get enough in them for 2015 and
2016 I feel like it's gonna be a really
good year I'm sorry there wasn't a lot
of drugstore products but right now I'm
actually working I actually just did a
drugstore favorites video I'm not too
long ago so I'll link that down below
but stay tuned because there's a lot
more drugstore videos coming your way

I'm already loving so again thank you
