be testing out a brand new foundation
from la girl it is the pro matte HD
foundation I'm really excited they do
have the regular like Pro HD foundation
which is great has great coverage but I
have very oily skin and it makes me look
like a greaseball at the end of the days
you guys tagged me on instagram when
they posted a picture about this and I
went on Ulta the day it was released and
I snagged up a couple colors that will
hopefully match me they look a bit
lighter in person but we will see so
yeah we're just gonna try out this
foundation today do it we're test to see
how it works hopefully it's not too
drying if you're interested in seeing
how this foundation looks and how it
wears then definitely keep watching
don't forget to subscribe before you
leave and let's just go ahead and get
started ok so if you guys have not tried
the LA girl Pro HD foundation this is
what it looks like this is on the Ulta
website it retails for $8.99 has 162
reviews and it has four stars which is
not that bad and this one they have 16
different shades in the regular pro
coverage liquid foundation and I have
tried this one it does have really great
coverage but like I said it does make me
really oily throughout the day so not
the biggest fan of it but I did like the
coverage of it so when I saw they came
out this I was excited this is the matte
version of that foundation it has only
three stars but it has two reviews and
they only have eight shades so I don't
know if they just started out with eight
shades and they're going to expand the
range but so far right now they only
have eight shades I'm surprisingly came
out with eight when the other one has 16
I'm pretty sure they came out with that
full 16 when they first launched that
foundation but it is the same price
$8.99 you get one fluid ounce and it
says that the pro matte foundation evens
out skin tone with a soft suede matte
finish the long wearing formula is
lightweight and medium to full coverage
provides complete natural looking
coverage and even skin tone so the only
con about this right now is the color
range and what they decided to come out
with this is a little bit different is
more of a skinny package like a skinny -
this is what the packaging looks like
they're just a nice matte bottle the
bottle is glass which is really nice and
it is a pump so we will try this out
these really look very similar in
Packaging I got beige and medium beige
this one is the shade medium beige this
one is the shade beige I think I'm
definitely gonna be more medium beige
I'm gonna go ahead and use my regular
primers so I do have like a nice break
out here and of course my rosacea as
well which actually isn't too intense
today so we're gonna go in with the
medium beige on the sponge I'm just
gonna kind of tap it on the bottom and
apply this all over the colors pretty
good for me right now if I was to get a
little bit tanner like if I was self tan
again it wouldn't look that great for me
and yeah it does have really nice
coverage that looks really good on the
skin actually and I can definitely tell
a difference between this foundation and
the pro one as well because the pro one
was looking a super shiny once I first
applied it and this one's looking like a
nice soft matte finish but it really
feels like I have nothing on my skin but
it does have really great coverage so
I'm gonna go in one more time I'm gonna
use one more pump that's one pump by the
way but we're just gonna Pat this on the
redness cuz I can see just a bit peeking
through same on my nose we know this is
always that area I have trouble with you
can still kind of see my breakout here
girl doesn't look like it's building up
very nicely on the forehead looks a
little patchy what do you guys think
like it's looking a little bit patchy
it's not too even when you try to build
it up on the forehead and I could still
see redness peeking through here so I
definitely think it is a medium to full
coverage it's pretty much dried down on
my skin now it feels like it's at a
powder finish which is nice like I said
I could still see some redness peeking
through here if you don't have a lot to
cover
we'll probably be full coverage on you
but there is some pigmentation coming
through there and of course my breakout
as well but if your skin doesn't have a
lot going on it's gonna be full coverage
on you it's just it depends on you know
what you have to cover and all of that
but I'm gonna do now is put on my
regular concealers a finish up my face
and I'll be back to give you guys
another update so don't mind my brows
there they got a lot of product in them
right now because I was trying to use
this tattoo thing from Maybelline and it
is thick it is thick so I had to go in
and like do the Front's here with my
makeup revolution brow pomade that I
love and then it was so dark that I was
like oh my gosh I need to lighten my
brows so then I took my wedding wild
brow gel and then now it's just there
thick anyways this is what the
foundation looks like I did not put any
more concealer on top of this blemish I
just did my regular under-eye concealer
I'm a highlight my blush and it does
look really good I was a little nervous
if the full coverage foundation was
going to take the concealer and make it
look cakey and not blend as well but it
ended up blending really really well
set it with my regular powder which is
the Too Faced peach perfect powder and
then I did my like regular blush
bronzers that I really love and then the
lips are hood of beauty in goddess I
really like the waist looking is so far
right now it is 208 as you can see so
I'm gonna wear this throughout the day
keep you guys updated on my blog camera
and we will see oh I gotta get this I'm
gonna get that but we'll see how this
looks throughout the day I hope you guys
are excited and yeah we're just gonna
check on this together okay I just got
done grocery shopping so I'm back at the
house I'm actually kind of hot right now
hot today but I wanted to show you guys
this foundation it's only been like a
little bit on like its 302 right now I'm
only been like 30 minutes or so maybe 40
I can't remember when I checked in
foundation looks good and natural
lighting can you guys I'm gonna give you
a little close-up it looks really nice
it doesn't look heavy it just looks very
smooth and matte and so far I'm really
liking the way that it looks I like the
way it looks in my studio lights and the
way it looks in natural light which is
really great because sometimes I could
be in there and like something in studio
lights and then come outside and be like
oh that was a lot but sometimes it's the
other way around sometimes looks really
good naturally bad in studio like so it
looks good in both Lighting's which is
great and you know I'm really impressed
with this so far I just want to share
with you what it looks like in natural
light for a little updates and yeah now
I'm gonna go unload these eat because I
went grocery shopping while I was really
hungry so that wasn't a good idea I got
cheese it grew so anyways I'll update
guys in just a little bit okay guys so I
am back and I'm gonna do a my final
check-in and let you guys know what I
think about the foundation so it is 1018
now and I have to say I really like this
foundation how it wears how it looks
like throughout the day I have not
blotted added more powder literally
nothing I've done nothing to this
foundation this is just how it's worn I
even had to work out its lastly really
well I had some sweat going on and none
of my sweat like smeared it off there's
no line dry foundations before where
even if I got like a little bit of water
on my chin the foundation really leave a
streak and that did not happen with this
one especially because I was sweating on
my face I really like this foundation I
feel like I will be wearing this a lot I
just need to find my right shade the
only problem too is there's not a lot of
shades so that's really the biggest
downfall of this foundation otherwise I
feel like everything really does just
sit well on the skin at first I was a
little nervous when I tried it because I
was thinking it's gonna be a little too
matte maybe like when I first put it on
I thought it might be a little too dry
in certain areas and break up but it
really did last $9 for a good matte
foundation that's not super drying lasts
all day works for me so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you've tried out
the foundation definitely let me know
down below in the comments I would love
to know so I will see you guys in my
next video bye
I've never got off the mascara I was
supposed to get off forever ago do I
even do YouTube videos or do I not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
