going to be on a new mascara a lot of
you have been asking if I've tried it
yet and I haven't you guys all know I
did a review on this mascara the L'Oreal
carbon black telescopic mascara I
absolutely love it as like been the only
mascara I've used since I purchased it
but a lot of you or let me know that
came out with a new one and I went to
drugstore and I saw it they do also have
a waterproof version of this I think
it's like blue instead of red has liquid
extension formula lash hugging bristles
and it says every lash extend and no
clumps so we will see this is the
packaging it's really nice it looks just
like the other mascara just in a
different too so let's go ahead baby
works also if you were wondering I did
get mine at Walgreens probably cheaper
at Walmart and let's see it was $10 I
think I saw it for 6 or 7 bucks at
Walmart
I'll show you an up-close version of the
brush in just a second but I'm gonna go
ahead and take this off and zoom you
guys in so we can see okay so I have no
mascara or eyeliner on and this is what
the brush looks like it's just really
small and tiny it's actually looks like
a little bit bigger than the other one
and it's kind of a little bit tapered in
the middle as well so it's kind of
thicker here on the end it tapers in and
it's kind of a little bit thicker at the
end but not too much but this is what it
looks like it's really nice just the
rubberized wand it is different than the
original though because the original
does not have like this tapered effect
right here it's more of just like a
straight one let's see if you could tell
see the difference so we'll see how it
works on us today I'm gonna head and dip
it in and I am gonna use my viewfinder
as my mirror
it's just easiest when I'm doing the
mascara
okay so I'm gonna do it one application
already I can tell it looks really
volumizing like looks like I have a lot
more lashes now the first one the right
original L'Oreal telescopic it's more of
a lengthening and separating mascara you
can build it up to be a little bit more
volumizing but I'll tell you right now
it's not as volumizing in this one this
will create some volume but it still
separates the lashes at the same time so
I'm really enjoying it so far that's a
really nice mascara so let me do the
other eye and I'll be back for
application number two for this eye okay
so those are both my eyes with this
mascara on I feel like I could stop here
because I'm impressed with how volume
eyes and how full they look it looks
like I'm wearing false lashes and I'm
not that's how I'm so impressed by this
I don't even think I need a second coat
I think I'm just gonna be good with this
one application cuz I really like the
way that it turned out I'm gonna see how
it works
on the bottom lashes really quickly and
it's just as great
easy to apply and I love it I love this
mascara this is gonna be my new favorite
okay so my final conclusion on size
scare is it's amazing I never stop at
one application with mascaras if you
know I'm trying to mount or trying to
build up my lashes usually I will do
like two applications of mascara and be
done but for me to stop at one that is
insane and that's how you know this
stuff really works but there's just such
a huge difference between the original
telescopic and this one because this one
is more about volume but it still really
does lengthen and separate the lashes so
this one just has a lot more volume to
it
so if I had to just pick one after
trying this one out it would definitely
be this one because it has everything
that I want in a mascara in one - its
volumizing and lengthening and separates
it's just beautiful so so far I'm loving
it and as you guys know I do use my
products throughout the month so you
guys always sing this at my FIF update
for February but you know if I love it
now I'm probably gonna love it this so
thank you guys so much for watching
don't forget to like the video if you
liked it and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
