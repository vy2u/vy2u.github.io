middle of filming another video and I
was like oh you know I've had a lot of
questions about this Mac roller wheel
and I figured I will come on here and
demo this for you guys on camera for the
first time just so we can test it out
and see how it works so I just got this
in PR the other day and I've had a few
of you asked me about this so I was like
you know it is very interesting so we're
just going to go ahead and try it out
but this is the roller wheel mascara I
don't know exact prices or release date
probably should have kept the PR packet
but I forgot so I will enter it all over
here when I find it out again this is
the roller wheel I just have the one in
black I did put the blue in the giveaway
box then to what the packaging looks
like supposedly this is supposed to give
you like the sharpest line for your
eyeliner it's the weirdest thing ever
keep you guys human so we're going to
test it down and just see how it works
I'm not going to lie I'm not like the
biggest fan of super thin liner I like a
good thick winged liner normally I use
the Lottie lunge in a wingwoman liner I
love that from the drugstore it's really
really good so you can see how this
works on the eyes and if it's difficult
or not but we're just gonna whoa okay
little bit thicker than I was expecting
it's good so it actually turned out a
little bit thicker than I Rojo
okay now how I normally do it is I
usually use a felt tip so I like flick
it back in to create that wing I'm
nervous
yes I do like a subtle set a little wing
that's pretty good
so that wing looks really good it was
drying down very matte I'm just rolling
it oh okay okay
Oh Oh No I'm getting bigger and bigger
it's a big letter I mean it looks really
sharp I'm just like please don't mess
this up so I'm let me tell them that
black it is like that's super pretty
it's going in a corner to outer corner
hi it did it but now I'm messing up this
part shoot I can't get was like one part
of my inner corner this is so mad that I
feel like my eyelid is tightening the
weirdest feeling I've never felt it with
a liquid liner before holy crap
it's like stiff it's like a literally
like a layer of liner it feels like I
could peel it off like that's the
sensation I'm getting really trying to
fix this inner corner right here I mean
it looks good but I don't know if I like
the formula
shoot I'm trying to fix it I'm just
making it thicker oh my god well let me
see if I can fix it I gotta hurry for it
dry and hard for drying shoot it's dry
I'm just gonna stop here before I have a
whole eye full of liner because it's
really sick right now
I know you can get a really sharp line
with it I completely agree
but the trouble I'm having is like
connecting it up to the upper lash line
and really getting that nice thick line
I mean it doesn't look bad I think it's
going to require a lot of practice but
the formula is so weird like it just
feels tightening from here to here it's
the weirdest feeling I've never felt it
before I mean it's not terrible and I
like it stinging my eyeballs out but it
feels like if I were to pull my eye this
way like it would all pull apart and
crumble that's the kind of feeling is
giving me so I don't know how I feel
about just yeah I'm going to try a
different technique on this eye I'm
going to try to do the lean first and
then go in with my lot in London the
combiner and just try to connect it to
the upper lashline and wing it out you
know where I'm comfortable let's just
try this on this I I feel like I keep
kind of dragging it on its side which
you shouldn't do like that just kind of
defeats the purpose of the ruler thingy
it's just I'm so used to salt to a
super-thin it looks like it just kind of
goes with lashline which I really like
that especially if you were to do
something look like this and when it
just lashes on this top of your eye I
mean that kind of just seamlessly goes
into the wing which i think is really
cool I think that eyeliner looks a
little bit better - the fact that this
is all my stuff over here this if I have
a wing down I am going to go in with my
logic London and just fix it a little
bit more to match the other eye so this
is the felt tip see this is I'm talking
about with we like salt tips just so
easy to go in
definitely feel like you can't go over
the liner like once it's set which can
be a little bit difficult to work with
especially if you're not used to a liner
you know I'm used to really putting it
on your eyes I think it's a really cool
concept I think it's great to use for
like the outer part of your liner will
kind of go clean it up a little bit more
of I didn't put foundation on but it is
a very sharp precise liner and like I
said with this eye I'll kind of serum
seal it from the middle of my eye all
the way out was really nice but I just
don't think it's something I would use
all the time especially because the
formula is so it just feel I'm going to
kind of like lash glam it away where
it's just like when you go to pool it's
just tight you know I definitely think
this is going to be something that you
need to try out I think with a lot of
practice it could be really cool to use
all the time I just don't know if it's
practical for me is a really deep matte
black which I do enjoy I don't know what
anybody think let me know in the
comments I'm kind of on the fence about
it because I mean you can kind of see
the difference between this eye right
now and this eye it dries down probably
within just a few seconds which is
really good if you you know don't want
to work with it too much but if you're
needing to work with your liner a little
bit it's going to be difficult to clean
up so it's kind of like a I have like a
wishy-washy opinion of it because I do
like it I think it's cool its innovative
it's different it's pigmented it's
intense it as long as you keep working
with it you could get really amazing at
it I think the handle is great I do want
to mention that it is flat on the sides
you can see it's just really easy to
hold and I appreciate that especially
with this kind of liner just the way
that the handle is shaped is really nice
and it doesn't pull out too much product
which is great as well so I'm going to
measure my eye and then I'll be right
back hey guys so I'm back I have some up
false lashes on and the rest I face
makeup done is to say I like the way the
liner looks like how black ative I don't
think I've had this big of a liner in a
while I mean I probably have probably a
few videos ago I love the look of a
release
liner and of course I got it super sick
because I struggled a little bit with
getting a really thin line like just the
way I normally do my eyeliner edges are
a little bit iffy but I didn't want to
go back in and try to fix it because
eventually it would go to my eyebrow and
it just wouldn't look cute anymore you
know I'm saying I mean always I think in
the comments below you're going to try
it out or not I'm really interested to
see what the price is I'll do some more
research for you guys but I think it's
really cool is that the formula is
different from anything I've ever tried
before your experience with liquid liner
winged liner and you just want to try
something different a different formula
something very very black and matte I
would recommend trying this out let me
know down below are you guys going to
try out this product or not and don't
forget to subscribe before you leave as
far as this is a short video but if
you're going to test it out on camera
for you guys and I will see you all in
my next video bye dang dang dang dang
