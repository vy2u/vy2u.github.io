sharing with you is some drugstore
products I'm loving and also show you
some new things that I haven't tried yet
and we're going to apply to the face now
I don't have any eyeshadow or anything
like that hey I don't have any on
because I have redid my makeup three
times and I didn't like it so I was like
screw it I'm just going no eye shadow I
put some mascara on and of course my
lashes are clumping together so it looks
really good but I didn't want to not
have a video up for Sunday so I figured
I would show you guys like some of these
new Maybelline products and show them on
my face for you and let you know what I
like what I don't like and then also try
out some newer products that I got today
as well I only got three new products
from Ulta from the drugstore and they're
from essence one is the essence pure
nude powder the essence contour powder
with a highlighter and then this matte
powder that they have and then I saw
this at my local Kroger
it's the wet wild apricot in the middle
blush and I've never seen this lush
before so I figured I would put that on
my face as well but yes since eyes
didn't work out today this is gonna be
all about face so let's just go ahead
and get started I have my primer on and
we're gonna start with the first thing
I've really been liking lately I've been
trying it out this past week and so far
I really do like it I think especially
when it starts getting colder like the
fall and winter months I'm really going
to enjoy this
it's the maybelline superstay better
skin skin transforming fan base
maybelline superstay better skin skin
transforming foundation the one that I
have is in four or five sand beige so
this is what it looks like you can see
right here that I've been using it quite
a bit I love that it has a pump I think
this is like such great packaging and
you can see right here that it's a
little bit of a thicker foundation
because it's not running off of my hand
so the way I like to apply this is with
a Beauty Blender so that's what I'm
going to use today I've already got my
primer on and everything like that what
I love the most about this foundation is
it does have a really great coverage and
it isn't too luminous I have very oily
skin so I like to make sure I don't go
with anything too crazy
glowy I did just try the Loreal Pro glow
and I
really liked it it's just super super
glowy so it's not something that I can
use during the summertime in the hot
months especially down here in Georgia
because it's too hot it's too hot humid
and it just melts off my face but it has
such a beautiful finish I'm like oh I
wish I could use it I just can't right
now anyways moving on to this foundation
I like the coverage of it and since it
is oil-free it's not very shiny like you
can see right now it kind of has like a
semi matte finish to it and I find that
once you set it and everything it just
looks beautiful on the skin this
foundation doesn't oxidize on me or
anything like that and it covers my nose
redness really well which I don't know
if anybody else has this issue but I
have redness obviously on my nose and
sometimes I get foundations that will
cover my face beautifully but then it
gets to my nose and it doesn't want to
cover it and I'm like um I don't
understand what's going on this is weird
so next I'm going to be using this I do
need to get the shade up from this which
is medium this is in light I feel like
when you're in the drugstore the medium
one looks super dark but if it's just a
little bit darker than this one I would
definitely if you're in your my skin
tone go with the medium one because this
is very light but let's be real I've
been too lazy to go to the drugstore and
get a darker shade so we're just gonna
work with this is a great concealer I
showed this in my drugstore dupes video
and if you haven't seen that I will link
it down below I had so much fun filming
that video I'm really glad you guys
enjoyed it I'm now like trying to hunt
in my makeup collection for new dupes
for you guys because I think that's such
a fun video I really love this one
because it's very creamy and it's very
full coverage as well and really
brightening underneath the eyes so it
blends out very well blends out even
better over the foundation and it really
looks like a high-end concealer and it
lasts all day long one bad thing I will
say about this is it does crease so you
want to make sure that you do set this
really well because otherwise it's going
to crease like a mother effers make sure
you set it and you will be good to go
and if you do find that it creases
really bad in your fine lines throughout
the day just take your finger and tap
that product back in and set it again
with whatever powder that you're using
even if concealers
crease on me I mean it just depends
because I don't have too many lines
underneath my eyes I mean I have a
couple deep creases but they're not too
bad I just you know I just tapped that
kind of stuff out you know especially if
it's a drugstore concealer I try not to
be too harsh on it because a it's more
affordable than high-end and B it's just
super easy for me to tap it out and put
a little powder on and go about my day
so now I'm going to use this contour
stick from them this is new as well one
thing I will say be sure to turn it all
the way down or else you are going to
get a smudge like this on the top it
just kind of dent it in but I like this
concept but if you continue to use it
and this goes down it kind of just
doesn't work I would just try to twist
it up a little bit when you first get it
and then start using it on the correct
sides but the first time I used it a lot
of the contour shade did get into the
yellow part I don't know if you can see
it and I had to kind of wipe some of it
away to clean up the contour with the
yellow side I wish I came out with this
in two separate packages because the
formula is great and they blend out
really well it's just they don't work
like this just doesn't work like this
it's a nice like ashy color so like
sometimes the highlight gets in there
and you're just like what well yeah well
use brush with this
but it blends out fairly easily like
it's not too crazy so you can see that
contour right there it's a nice shade
and everything it's just a pain in the
ass to work with you know when I use
stuff like this like cream contouring
the only places I like to use it is
underneath my cheekbones I don't really
use stuff like this on my nose because
it's just too much I'm going to go ahead
and take the yellow side and go under
and clean up a little bit and again I'm
taking it all the way back down if I'm
doing my makeup I don't see myself
wanting to hassle with the dual sided
product that's just my opinion
everybody is completely different some
people love it some people don't
and I want to see how much product is in
this because I look to the highlighters
the highlighters had like no product in
it whatsoever it was terrible yeah same
thing barely any product I mean now what
we're going to do is just dust away the
baking that we did I'm really getting
right underneath that lower lash line
moving on to my favorite part since I'm
going to set my whole face today I'm
obsessed with this powder I love it so
much that about another one and I keep
that in my purse if I keep it in my
purse that's how we know it's good
because that's what I take with me
everywhere to blot and touch up my face
so this is the maybelline superstay
better skin scan transforming powder
with salicylic acid I think so like as
it breaks me out but this hasn't broke
me out yet this is in nude 25a I love
the mirror on this like that is such a
let's not look at my dirty desk I love
the mirror on this and I do love the
fact that it comes with a sponge this
can be handy if you don't have a brush
and just want to press it into your skin
I like this and I like that it's a
pretty big sponge as well I know some
people want more of the product but the
product is really good as well I mean I
have nothing bad to say about it's a
medium coverage powder and it just looks
beautiful on the skin it makes you look
very like airbrushed and smooth it is
just stunning now that we have some
color on our face I am going to try to
contour with this essence contour and
highlight duo this is in the shade light
probably could have gone with the darker
shade just I've purchased it online and
didn't really know the color this is
what it
like I'm just going to take my NARS eita
brush sometimes light contours do the
most contouring you know what I'm saying
like sometimes they come out of the
woodwork and surprise you so hopefully
this is one of them I feel like it's
doing a pretty good job might be a
mixture of my cream contour I don't know
that looks pretty dang good probably
should go a little less heavy on the
powder I kind of like it I like that
it's just like a medium toned contour
shade so I actually like this I feel
like you can see a difference right I
think it looks good I it wouldn't hurt
me to go a shade darker and use less
powder but it's not a bad product it
blend it out really well now we're going
to try the blush before we get on to the
drugstore highlighters and this is the
wet and wild apricots in the middle and
this just looked like an apricot shade
like just a really gorgeous peachy color
so this is what the shade looks like
it's very light has like a shimmer to it
I like it it just adds some warmth to
the skin yeah eyelash on my eye it's
like a peachy warm blush okay so the
next thing we're trying our highlighters
I'm going to try both of these the one
that came in this and also the essence
pure highlight okay so I'm going to try
one of the highlighters on one side of
my face and the other on the other side
this is the one that Kathleen was
talking about I saw one of her videos
it's the essence pure nude highlight and
it looks really pretty and then also I'm
going to try the highlight in this
contour highlight palette because i
swatched it and it looked really nice as
well so I'm going to take the pure nude
highlight first and apply this to my
cheeks wow that is so pretty she was
right girl she was right that is a
really gorgeous highlighter and then
we're going to take the one from this
little kit which was like a pretty
golden highlight this one's really
pretty too
I like both of them I feel like this
one's kind of more like in-your-face
but this one's really nice too so these
two are really great products from
essence I would definitely go online I
got mine from Ulta calm so now that I
have my face makeup on I'm going to
apply my lips and eyebrows off-camera
and then I'll be back to wrap up this
video okay guys so that is it for this
