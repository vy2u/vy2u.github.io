be doing a review where tests on the new
maybelline superstay foundation they
revamp this came back out with it and a
lot of you been asking me how I feel
about it and I figured I would just
share that with you guys today I have
been trying this out a little bit since
I got it I've kind of been doing that
with foundations recently I've been
trying them out and then I'll come on
here and do a wear test I actually just
did that with the Revlon one but I let
you guys go along with me throughout my
day and also let you see how it wears
and how it looks on my skin so if you
guys have not subscribed already be sure
to subscribe down below and yeah let's
just go ahead and get started okay so
like I said this is the main Molino
super stay full coverage foundation
right now it only has six reviews and it
has about four and a half stars it's
eleven dollars and there are one two
three four one two three four there are
sixteen shades in this collection you
also get one fluid ounce as well says
that it is oil free it doesn't clog
pores dermatologist tested full coverage
foundation with a seamless finish evens
out camouflages and enhances minimizes
the appearance of flaws and
imperfections and it glides on the skin
for smooth and breathable wear so it
also says that the saturated color
pigments provide an ultra transforming
effect in this long-lasting foundation
the lightweight yet high-impact coverage
formula glides on the skin for a
flawless finish that lasts all day so
with this foundation I've been liking
choose a Beauty Blender with it more
than a brush I feel like the Beauty
Blender kind of soaks up a little bit
more product that way doesn't look too
cakey on the skin if you kind of want a
reference on foundations that I really
like I love the maybelline superstay
better skin I think this looks really
gorgeous on the skin it looks like skin
it has medium to full coverage and it
feels really great I like this product a
lot as well as the Maybelline Dream
matte mousse this one I like to use with
a brush and it is so good it literally
makes you look flawless it is insane so
I love this one so if you kind of don't
know what foundations I like from
Maybelline these are the two that I
really love and we recommend to you guys
I'm gonna prime with my regular primer
so I have Smashbox primer water and then
I also have a Natasha Jona anti-shine
primer now I got two shades and the
shade I'm going to use today is a little
too dark for you so we're just gonna
have to work with it so we have to wear
high neck tops it may be like a
turtleneck or something to make sure
people don't see
the difference between my face and my
body because I didn't have a chance to
self tan last night like I wanted to I
have the shade 312 golden and then 310
Sun beige this one is way too warm way
too dark for me I have to send this one
back but Sun beige is still a little too
dark for me unless I'm super self tan
like it's like the very next day kind of
soft and then I can use this but right
now it is gonna be a little too dark on
me but we'll just have to work with it
I'm just gonna shake it up does have a
pump it's a really nice glass bottle
I believe the older one used to be one
of my favorites as well I believe I used
to use this foundation back in high
school I can't remember 100% I don't
even remember if I use it on my channel
I should go look that up okay so I put
some on the back of my hand and like I
said I like to play with a Beauty
Blender so I'm just gonna take a little
bit so I just took a little bit and put
it on the bottom of the Beauty Blender
and now I'm going to pounce this in see
it's super dark definitely need a
lighter shade but when I'm nice and self
tan this was pretty good this is
definitely the only one that will match
me
it is pretty matte like you can see
there's not too much glow on the skin
pretty much dries down to a satin matte
finish I would say this shade is a
little orange what shade am I in this
one I am buff beige in this one so I was
gonna mix one of my favorite Maybelline
foundations of this one but I wanted you
guys to really see how it looks on its
own so I didn't use that much product
and I've got really great coverage as
you guys can see there's like a little
bit of redness peeking through here but
it's really not much at all it's not
something that I worry about because I'm
gonna put concealer on my face anyway so
I don't go ahead and put more foundation
right here just because it will get a
little cakey but you can see the
difference between this side and this
side but you can obviously see the
difference between the side and this if
you don't if you're new to my channel I
do have rosacea so that is what the
redness is getting worse since the snow
is here it's super super cold
look at my hand oh oh just have to work
with it I did wear this one Davison I
traveled to Philly last week last Friday
and definitely have some opinions about
hot war but so far it looks good
it's I wouldn't say it masks any texture
I feel like it does kind of accentuate
some of the texture that I have here but
it's not absolutely terrible or anything
like that it is a nice matte finish so
this is what's looking like so far I'm
gonna go ahead and put on some concealer
and powder try to help fix the color
this is what we're working with right
now and then I will be back to give you
guys another update and another look on
this foundation ok guys so this is what
it looks like whenever I have my full
face done I have concealer powder blush
highlight all of that on my face right
now give you like a little close-up
right here you can see it looks pretty
good my texture really isn't emphasized
right now it does look really nice it is
a matte finish for sure and yeah this is
just what it looks like the only problem
I'm having is the color of this I feel
like it does get quite a big darker once
it dries down I mean once I set
everything I was like wow this is
getting really dark and I feel like it
just keeps getting darker I don't know I
feel like it's just going a little bit
more orange on me right now I will say I
feel like it does oxidize on my skin
that's my little update for now so far
so good just a little too dark a lot too
dark
I think else looks pretty good so far so
like I said I'm going to take you guys
throughout my day and we're gonna see
how this wears I will see you guys in
just a little bit so it is 7:41 and had
the sunday shoes on for a little bit so
far and I what's your opinion first this
is a wear test this is that same
foundation that I wore when we were at
the taco place in Philly then I asked
you about
mmm looks good really like it looks good
on this again looks a little dark yeah
it is
I get so Elia with this one I don't know
why but like my t-zone here I feel like
it shows a lot of texture when we were
in Philly I wore this on Friday when we
first got there and I didn't bring the
foundation because I didn't really like
it which I'm glad I did it because I
ended up wearing my NARS one which I
loved much more and it lasts all day
this one's not my favorite I feel shiny
I am I'm so shiny in here rich in
shining this I mean yeah sometimes it's
good sure in here like where you can see
your pores and stuff yeah like you know
we're looking more so like right here
yeah I have a bed and then this is where
I was wearing off last time on my
forehead well it wore off pretty quickly
on me the last time I wore this so and
right now I'm not really obsessed with
it when it's only been on for a few
hours I get really oily I'm definitely
gonna have to blot but every time I do
wear this I bought a lot like I have to
always continuously blot when I wear
this foundation not a fan of that but
I'm gonna keep wearing it and I'll give
you guys a final update at the end of
the night kind of like you know my final
thoughts on everything okay guys so I am
back and this is what my foundation
looks like and I have to say I don't
think I've tried a foundation that makes
me as oily as this foundation does like
I get so freakin oily and I bought so
much throughout the day with this one it
says it's matte but I feel like it's
matte when you first apply it but it
doesn't stay matte throughout the day to
help keep you met right now it doesn't
look too terrible on my skin I mean it
kind of does around my nose area that's
where I'll get some serious like cake
edge is right in here it looks a little
cakey through here like my pores look
really intense right here I don't know
it's just it's not my favorite
foundation from the drugstore again I
would much rather use the better skin or
even the dream
most those to do last well on my skin I
did wear this foundation this past
Friday and it was like rubbing off on my
forehead it didn't look the best on my
skin either we were out and my skin
looked pretty cakey and I was like sucks
so this only bummer about trying new
products and sometimes your face will
seriously look cakey and you're like
well I can't even tell these people what
I'm doing because they're gonna think
I'm crazy they're hueso but whenever I
do blot my skin I do get a lot of
product actually on the tissue the
napkin whatever I'm using so that could
be a reason why it doesn't last very
long but I didn't blot my forehead much
today and I just feel like it's kind of
fading around my hairline I don't know
why I haven't really touched my face
much I really don't judge my face in
general I do feel like it's kind of
fading around here just a little bit
this one's just a pass for me I wasn't a
big fan of it I need to go see if I
tried this foundation before today guys
that is my review on this foundation I
really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching if you've tried
this foundation definitely let me know
your thoughts down below in the comments
did you kind of have the same reaction
as me what's your skin type let me know
how it went so thank you guys again for
watching and I will see you all in my
