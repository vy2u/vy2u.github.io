a really quick one it's just a review
and demo on this new mascara from
Maybelline it's called the big eyes and
what I'm going to do is while I'm
talking about it I'm gonna have like a
little little side when you call this
like a little side clip going on showing
you a demo of it as well so I'm just
going to go ahead get started now this
is from Maybelline and it is part of the
falsies collection and it's just the big
eyes mascara now you have a wand for
your lower lashes which is really nice
and tiny and then on the other side you
have one for your upper lashes down I
love this concept because I find myself
always going out and finding different
mascaras for my bottom lashes and then
different mascara for my top lashes
because I want something that's really
gonna make my bottom lashes not smudge
or anything like that underneath my eyes
because as I'm going throughout my my
day you know I don't want to have to
deal with that now I didn't get the
waterproof one but this stays on so well
I never have a problem with it flaking
getting a little smudgy and black
underneath my eyes I've not had that
problem at all with this mascara and it
holds a curl so so well like I can't
even tell you how amazing it is I kind
of thought that it would fall throughout
the day but they didn't do that that
really sells me on mascara half the time
if you can hold a curl more than likely
I'm gonna love it
another thing about this mascara is the
one on the lower lash one is so tiny you
could get right to the roots even on
your upper lashes and really just apply
the product at the root and make your
lashes look a lot more fuller there so I
really like that about it as well I
don't find that this is comfy easily at
all I don't ever really have a problem
with clumping if I have maybe a little
too much on the outer half of my eye
again I will go in with the lower lash
wand and it just helps take care of that
and it really separates lashes very well
I find that
this mascara is great at separating
holding a curl making my lashes look
thick and they kind of look false in a
way so I really like this and I think it
was about sex six or seven dollars I
can't remember off the top of my head
but it's definitely worth it this is
actually taken over my L'Oreal shocking
extensions which a lot of you know I
used for months and I just love this one
a lot more the fact that it's a dual
ended one so I just don't have to reach
for my other mascara to do my bottom
lashes or anything like that so this is
a new fave of mine I've been using it
non-stop I haven't used any other
mascara since I've been trying it so let
me know what you think of this down in
the comments below and I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
