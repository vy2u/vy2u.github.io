to be a first impression I haven't done
one in a while so I figured why not do
one on this product and I actually saw
it in the drugstore yesterday and it
just seemed intriguing I'm gonna try a
new mascara in a while so I figured I
would pick this up if the Maybelline the
colossal smoky eyes volume express
mascara says instant volume no clumps of
smoky dark lashes 9 times the volume and
this is in the color black smoke and
that was the darkest one I saw I didn't
see like a blackest black or anything
but a hearing black smoke kinda reminds
me of a grayish black so we would see
how this works and that's just what the
packaging look like looks like it has
like little flames and stuff on the top
let's check out the brush it looks just
like the colossal mascara but with
flames on it that wand is pretty large
so that's what that looks like
alright now I'm going to zoom in and
we're gonna get started okay so what I'm
gonna do is I am gonna curl my lashes
just because I curl my lashes every time
I apply mascara and I just I have to do
it so going to curl them and this first
impression I'm just gonna let you know
what I think of it right off the bat
I'll leave it down below in the
description box if they liked or
anything like that brother day
yeah I don't think it's very volumizing
I kind of feel like it's a it's just
kind of a weird mascara I don't know how
to explain this it's you can see my
lashes kind of look just dull like delay
they're not really curled you see it
just doesn't look right to me
yeah I'm not a big fan of this so far
yeah I don't like the way that's nice my
lashes look it just looks kind of funky
and they're kind of like all over the
place and they just don't look I don't
know they don't look right they just
look so weird I think this is more of a
mascara to layer if you're wanting to
buy it if you're looking for one just to
get volume I don't necessarily think
this is the one even though it looks
like they're selling you keep in mind I
do have my upper waterline lined so it
makes it look thicker but actually
looking at my lashes they're not very
volumizing at all and they just kind of
look no a spider II kind of look I don't
know it just looks it it's not my
favorite I don't like it I wouldn't
repurchase it again it doesn't really
curl at all I don't think if I would
have curled my lashes that they wouldn't
curled with the mascara okay so
basically what I think about this is it
doesn't really volume eyes at the lashes
I think more than anything it separates
it doesn't really give you that false
lash effect like it's kind of saving in
here
smoky dark lashes I don't agree with
that I think your lashes just look this
same they just look a little bit longer
with this mascara so you could probably
use this as your lengthening mascara but
it doesn't curl very well and it doesn't
give you a lot of volume which those are
what I'm looking for I'm looking more
for volume because my lash is already so
long I don't want them to look even more
spidery and then they can already look
so I don't really like this it might be
some people's cup of tea mascaras are
different with everybody but I don't
really like it I mean compared to the
other drugstore mascaras I have I would
definitely pick the L'Oreal telescopic
mascara over this
even though stocking extensions because
that one gives you so much volume
especially
basic your lashes because the wand is so
small but this one since the one so big
it's really hard to kind of build up
that mascara on your lashes so that was
this first impression I hope you guys
enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up
and leave any products you want me to do
a first impression on it down below I
will also be letting you know if it
flaked or anything throughout the day in
the description box as well so I hope
you guys enjoy this and I'll see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
