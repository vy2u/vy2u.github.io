a review and a demo on a new mascara
that I picked up the other day this is a
Maybelline volume Express the rocket
mascara this is what it looks like it
has a really really cute packaging just
like kind of that pink and purple blue
kind of packaging it's really really
cute I got mine at Walmart for I think
it was 644 I figured I would just kind
of do a little first impression review
and demo for you guys today so you'll
kind of know my first thoughts of it
I'll layer it up for you like we'll do
one coat two coats three coats and we'll
see if it lives up to the things that it
says on the package so it says it's a
rocket brush which the brush is really
nice I'll show you when I take out the
packaging but it says explosive volume
even from root to tip 8 times clump free
free volume so supposedly it gives you a
lot of volume and we will see so this is
what it looks like this is what the
brush looks like it's just a nice little
rubberized wand
nothing too too crazy so I'm gonna go
ahead and put this into the mascara oh
and if you're wondering I do this a lot
my sweater you see how it has the studs
I'm really into this right now I got
this from forever 21 and I'm obsessed
with it it's probably the best sweater I
think I've ever purchased from forever
21 and what it says it's like completely
me I love it and I live by the same so
you have the studs it's kind of like an
ombre effect to darker pink and it says
do everything regret nothing but I just
wanted to show you guys this sweater cuz
I knew I'd probably get some questions
on it well let's see so this book looks
like it does look like a little rocket
type thing cute cute and I'm gonna zoom
you guys in to whenever it kind of looks
like the covergirl LashBlast wand when
you put it into my Skara it looks just
like it okay so we're gonna go ahead and
do one coat
so far it's really black and it does
look pretty volumize
feel like the brush kind of hurts my
waterline though if I get too close
you
all right so this is the first coat
pretty nice for just one coat I'm not
going to lie that's actually really
really good so I'm going to do the other
eye real quick and I'll be right back to
show you a second coat so second coat
you
okay so this is the second coat and I
feel like I'm gonna stop it two coats
because it's starting to get a little
clumpy and you can kind of tell um it is
getting clumpy after the second coat I'm
gonna have to go in with my lash
perfection mascara and separate these
bad boys but it does give good bit of
volume and I do like that let me see if
it does good on the lower lashes yeah
lower lashes is good
okay so I've done both eyes now and this
is what they look like like I said after
about the second coat they got a little
clumpy and the first coat definitely no
clumps I could actually live with just
one coat of this mascara I just like to
build up my mascaras oh so that's why I
wanted to try two coats I do think it
looks good but like I said after two you
got to kind of separate it with a lash
perfection and it just looks a little
too clumpy for me to just build up by
itself so I definitely think this is a
good mascara though I don't regret
purchasing it one thing I do have to say
is the wand is really hard it kind of
hurt my eyes whenever I got really close
to my lash line because I like to get
you know when you put my scar on you
want to get sort of right to the root
and bring it up and kind of move back
and forth and every time I got to my
waterline it kind of scratched it so
that kind of hurt but otherwise it's a
really good mascara I recommend it if
you just want one mascara that's gonna
give you some volume and length and I
definitely felt like it curved up my
lashes as well it's just it's a nice
mascara I like it just do one coat
though so yes I hope you guys enjoyed
this if you have this mascara let me
know what you think of it down below
thank you for watching and I will see
you guys in my next video
