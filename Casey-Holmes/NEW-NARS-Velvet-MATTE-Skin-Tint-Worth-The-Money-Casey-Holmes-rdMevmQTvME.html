I'm going to be doing a review and demo
hopefully it'll be quick on the new NARS
Velvet Matte skin tint and I've had a
lot of questions from you guys asking if
I like this what do you think foil e
skin sensitive skin what do I think so
I'm gonna tell you everything I think
about this if I say think one more time
so I'm just gonna tell you all about
this product the pros the cons what I
like what I don't like and there are
definitely some don't like NARS did send
these as PR but as always all opinions
are my own and that's it just doing it
for the review right okay so really
quickly I'm going to tell you a couple
different things about this product
first off there are twelve shades in the
range which i think is really nice
basically it says introducing Velvet
Matte skin 10 SPF 30 instant
gratification effortless application
protects and perfects with a soft matte
finish it's oil free all-day wear and
then it says transparent blurring
powders instantly enhance the look of
skin by helping to diffuse imperfections
with a powerful optical effect says that
rose fruit extracts visibly minimize the
appearance of pores while controlling
shine so there is 1.7 ounces in here
that's a great size because in most
foundations or creams there's about 1
ounce so you get an extra point 7 ounces
in this product I am usually in the
color st. Moritz medium one I really
like this one it's not too warm it's not
too yellow it's kind of like right there
in between I love this I even love it
when I'm a little bit lighter than this
it just matches perfectly and if I need
it to be a little bit darker which is
what I did today I use the color medium
1.5 and if I use this on its own it is
warm and it looks a little orange and it
just doesn't look good so don't like
this alone but I do like it mixed with
this one and then they'd it's in the
shade medium 2 which is just way too
dark I'm just not going to work for me
so I have been working with these but
again mainly these st. Moritz the medium
one shade you can see right there I do
love this packaging I love the squeezie
too so you can just squeeze it onto your
brush and then go about your day I love
that I also like that you can mix this
with other products because one night
when I was getting ready for a full roll
my Marc Jacobs foundation which is a
little more yellow was not matching my
spray tan that I got so I was able to
mix this in with it and it all matched
perfectly so I love that you can mix
this with different foundations and it
still has a gorgeous finish and I do
like the fact that it's easy to blend
concealer and any face products that you
want to on your face it just the cream
products kind of just glide on and I
think that's great
I'm gonna move on to the cons now
because there are some cons in this
product and these cons are the reason
why I don't know if I would repurchase
the product so the first thing that I'm
not too keen on is I feel like I can't
build it up on my nose I show you guys
in the demo which will probably be in
Saipan but on my nose I tried to build
it up because it's so hard to cover the
redness on my nose and this doesn't
cover it up the first try so I try to
build it up and it just ends up looking
cakey and just kind of separated on my
nose and I don't like that so I don't
feel like you can build this product up
that well in my personal opinion at
least I can't and it also does break me
out a little bit it's not like terrible
breakouts where they hurt but it will
cause some pimples on my face which I
don't like I don't know why it breaks me
out I wish it didn't break me out but it
definitely does the other thing is I
know they say that this lasts a really
long time but personally I feel like it
doesn't last that long I mean to me I
would never wear this out because I
don't feel like this would last
throughout the night I don't know it
just breaks up on me and it ends up
looking just horrible I would say by
about like hour 7 this just breaks up on
me really bad especially where I get
really oily which that kind of sucks but
I do want to say I forgot to put this in
the pros but this does control your oil
really really well I think this is a
great day to day foundation if you
wanted to run errands or something like
that I think this is perfect if you have
oily skin the true test will obviously
be with the hot weather if it'll keep
you matte to keep you looking good all
day long because we all know if you have
oily skin the hot weather is like our
enemy and we just we don't wear
foundation sometimes I personally don't
I'm on the fence if this would work in
the summertime with sweat and just oil
and
thing like that I kind of feel like it
would break up really quickly but like I
said I cannot go a full eight hours with
this and feel confident I feel like it
just starts little cakey and gross and I
just don't like it and one other con I
know I feel like I'm like batching this
product but it is a good product I just
want to let you guys know all the
different things that I feel about it
but the last con is I feel like it's
hard to blend I don't know why I pry my
face and everything I use smoothing
primers and pore filling ones but I
don't use anything mattifying like to
mattifying I use the benefit matte
rescue which is a mattifying gel but it
does not dry my skin out whatsoever if
anything it makes my skin smoother and
feel more hydrated for some reason this
thing I feel like you have to blend
really quickly and if you don't blend
really quickly it's just going to look
crazy and I feel like it just it just
dries so fast so it's a little bit more
difficult to blend just make sure you're
really working with it and that's why I
like using a brush I've tried with my
fingers a Beauty Blender and a brush and
a brush is by far my favorite way to
apply it just because you have control
and you can buff it in really quickly
because it doesn't need to sit on the
skin long because it's going to want to
stick and keep you modified for the day
you know what I'm saying I feel like if
your skin is not as oily as mine you
would like this if you have dry skin
don't even try it I feel like it would
just cling to dry patches and break up
and if you have combo skin I think you
might like this if you just use like a
hydrating primer or more of your normal
areas I think you would really like it
so that is basically why I think about
this product I do like it I'm really
happy that they sent it to me but
because of the cons I personally would
not repurchase it just from my
experience what I would recommend if
you're kind of on the fence about it
especially after my review I would go
and get a sample from NARS NARS is one
of my favorite brands but this is just
one that I mean I'm looking at my nose
right now and it's just separating and
I'm just like yeah thank you guys so
