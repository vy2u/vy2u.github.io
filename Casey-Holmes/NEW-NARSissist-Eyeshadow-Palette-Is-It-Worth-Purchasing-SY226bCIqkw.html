palette review on this new NARS
eyeshadow palette that they recently
came out with this is a narcissist eyes
shadow palette you get 15 shades in here
nice palettes just that same kind of
NARS packaging it has a very large
mirror as well and this is retail for
$80 they say it's like a total value of
163 or something like that but I wanted
to do a video for this palette because
when I was on Sephora I saw so many
mixed reviews and to me it's really hard
to kind of figure out what you want to
do when there's so many mixed reviews
it's kind of like one of those things
it's a hit or miss you got to try it out
see if you like it so I decided to
splurge and get this palette because
honestly there's only been like I think
one product from NARS that I just did
not like it all everything else for the
most part I've really enjoyed but this
palette is an exception I do not like
this palette at all I think I had my
hopes up way too high for this palette
because even though I saw mixed reviews
I was like oh you know everybody they
say they hate this thing and I end up
loving it and things like that
but no I tried to do a first impression
on this and I got so pissed that I quit
filming the video and I was like I'm
done I'm not even to try with this so
I'm gonna try to kind of make this video
not super long I want to get to the
point let you guys know but I don't like
about it though the pros of this palette
is first off it's in this gorgeous
packaging I'm a sucker for NARS
packaging I think it's beautiful you
have a really gorgeous big mirror and
then you have these really gorgeous
shades as well now let's get on to all
the cons I have about this palette I
mean you have a good amount of matte and
shimmer shades if this palettes
pigmentation was what it's supposed to
be for the price in my personal opinion
this would be the perfect everyday
palette you have a nice deep matte Brown
a nice matte black you have a nice
transition shade and also in that cream
shade I feel like those are the four
main colors that you want as matte
shadows because you always want to match
transition shade always a matte brow
bone in there I mean you can have
shimmer as well but I think a matte one
is typical for almost everybody and
again with the matte darker shades the
lighter shades I absolutely despise I
was having really high hopes about
this transition shade right here but you
couldn't even see it on my eye like it
wasn't pigmented enough to where you
could see that definition this was
actually the first color that I applied
to my eyes as my transition shade
because it looks like it would be the
perfect kind of color for that but it's
not I was really disappointed in it this
shade right next to it I had such a high
hopes for this you swatch it and it is
absolutely stunning like look at that I
applied it to my eyes and it is so
difficult to blend now I will say that
the darker shades obviously do have
better pigmentation than the lighter
shades but usually that's just how it
goes the darker shades are always gonna
have more pigmentation because they're
darker let me just say this black is the
choppiness black ever it's not smooth it
just has like it's like you're you can't
grab all the color you can see right
there on my finger that it's not a
smooth formula I mean you can see my
skin and that that's the matte black in
the palette right there you can see it's
just it's horrible okay I know I'm being
pretty harsh on this palette but I'm
just being honest if I don't like
something I'm gonna let you know why so
I'm sorry if I'm being a little harsh a
little bit Brown but that's just what
happens sometimes I just wanna sum this
whole review up with the three things I
dislike about the palette pigmentation
is not there they blend horribly oh my
gosh they're just super choppy they
don't look gray on the eyes they're not
smooth eyes shadows you could go to wet
and wild and get these same kind of
shades for way less than half the price
and get better pigmentation and you live
with this I absolutely do not think it's
worth the money this will not be used at
all I may have high expectations but
when you pay $80 or something you expect
those high expectations to be met that's
basically my whole review on this
palette I don't think it's worth it
please go to your Sephora and just try
it out see what you think of them if
you've had a great experience with this
palette then totally let me know in the
comments below but so this baby will be
going back to Sephora so if you do like
these product review videos and please
give it a thumbs up and I'll continue to
do them for you guys and don't forget to
subscribe to my channel to see more
videos and I will see you
in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
