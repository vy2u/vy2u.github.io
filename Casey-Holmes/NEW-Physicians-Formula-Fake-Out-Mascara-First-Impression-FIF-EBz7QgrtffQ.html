video I know I haven't done one of these
in a really long time I just got caught
up with moving and then I didn't really
have time to just sit down film FIF
video but now I can just sit down film
this video take my time because that's
the way I like it so I'm really excited
to go ahead and start April off with an
FIF video as always there will be and if
I update at the end of each month if you
are interested to just kind of update
you about the products I've been trying
out if I still have the same opinion
about a product as I did in the
beginning of the month so always keep
your eyes out if you watch if I have
videos to keep an eye out for the FIS
updates because I will be doing those as
well so I'm really excited to start this
back and I have a mascara for you guys
today
if you follow me on Instagram you know
that Physicians Formula did gifts some
free products that are new so I figured
I would go ahead and start off with the
Scarab but the next FIF will be on the
BB cream and the BB cream powder so keep
an eye out for that as well I mean we'll
be showing you guys that I'm not getting
paid by Physicians Formula to you know
do this on these products this is just
their new spring stuff so I'm not being
paid by them to talk about this just
figure out try it out a lot of you know
I have a love-hate relationship with
Physicians Formula so we will see how I
like this today this particular mascara
is the organic wear fake out mascara
this is 100% natural false lash effect
it says it has unbelievable volume
length curl and then it just on the side
says a bunch of different things of what
it's free of which is really cool so
it's definitely eco-friendly gonna go
ahead and take it out oh ok so like I
said this is what it looks like and the
brush is fairly large if you can see I
do apply this like in one application
and to application is how I
by it it's up to you on how you apply
your mascara you can do whatever you
want but this is just what I do so it's
going to the first application
that's a really really nice application
like that looks really good
this mascara I can tell already
separates very very well and that just
looks freakin good so I'm loving the
first application I am gonna go ahead
and do another one like I said this is
just what I do in mascara you don't have
to do a second application or a lot of
you say I have five million coats but
it's what I like so I think this makes
me look like I have false lashes on and
it looks really good so let's go ahead
and go in with another application okay
this is the second application of it I
definitely like it more when it's just
the one application just looks a lot
more natural and it looks really nice so
I wouldn't go with a second application
with this one I would just go ahead and
stick with one but it's personal
preference if you like I'm super clumpy
go right ahead
so I'm going to get my covergirl lash
perfection and separate these bad boys
out I swear you can always rely on with
covergirl lash perfection mascara to
save the day when it comes to gloves if
you're wondering I'm talking about it's
this mascara right there but okay so I
do like it I actually like it a lot kind
of combined with the covergirl the first
application like I said was really nice
and just looked like I had false lashes
on and then when I went to the second
coat got a little too clumpy but after
going with the lash perfection I think
it looks great
if you don't like really dramatic lashes
of course you won't like this but I like
dramatic lashes and I think this looks
really nice especially if I had liner on
I think it would look really pretty so
I'm going to go ahead and do my other
eye and I'll be right back I just added
my liner and in my other
and I think it looks really good they're
really nice full lashes I also forgot to
mention that this mascara I did really
well on the bottom lash line I really
like it so far I think it creates a lot
of volume and whenever you use the
covergirl lash perfection I feel like
afterwards it looks really amazing make
sure you look like and false lashes on
so I actually really like this the first
coat I feel like it's the complete best
you're not wearing liner or something I
think a first coat would be great with
this but if you want more dramatic
lashes definitely go with a second coat
and then follow it up with a cover or
lash perfection the brush is not too
hard it doesn't hurt my upper waterline
or anything like that so that's an A+ in
my book so don't forget to keep an eye
out for the FIF updates that i'll be
doing at the end of the month so you can
kind of see what I think about this
towards the end after using it for the
complete month so hope you guys enjoyed
this don't forget to like the video and
thank you guys for watching I'll see you
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
