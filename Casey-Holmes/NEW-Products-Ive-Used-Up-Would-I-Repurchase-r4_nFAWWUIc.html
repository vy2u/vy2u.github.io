products I've used up wait for it
this bag is completely full and I knew I
wanted to go ahead and get this video
for you guys I do have some new products
in here so it's not like always the same
exact stuff you know I kind of keep it
interesting for you so I do have some
newer things in here and I just had to
mention it because it's starting to fall
over I keep it up here on my shoe shelf
and it started to like tower and it's
just not a good thing so we're just
gonna go through this bag and talk about
an assload of products the first thing I
see are two megabytes this is a luminous
thin lines instead of touch makeup wipes
I only use makeup wipes to like clean up
any excess makeups underneath my eyes
after I wash my face or use it to wipe
off makeup on my hand I don't use it to
take off all my makeup on my face
because it just irritates my skin but
this is nice it does take off all the
makeup it doesn't stain your eyes or
anything like that so I do recommend
these I use these all the time back in
the day also these Mac Dimmie wipes
these were the 30 sheets I have this
ncpo for eight bucks and I liked them
but I wouldn't purchase them to me mine
were a little dry and I know I just
really like them I'm probably the one
person that says that because everybody
else I know that has tried these love
them maybe mine was just a bad patch I
don't know I also have this Clinique I
take off the day I'm makeup remover
there's like a little tiny bit left in
here
this stuff is amazing I tried going to a
drugstore makeup remover but then I
tried just stung my eyes and didn't even
take this stuff off so I went back to
this and I love it I need you to
purchase another one to keep forgetting
about it but yeah I love love love the
stuff it takes off everything on your
eyes so next up I have this lush lovely
Jolie's a breast cream and yes it's a
breast cream it's a firming cream I know
some people can use this underneath
their eyes and I use this for my neck
and chest area just to keep everything
nice and lifted and put together so I
love this I like the smell I did
purchase another one yeah I don't know
it's like a huge difference but
I mean it's nice speaking of lotions
Abbas locks eat on or locks locks Peeta
is the ultra-rich body lotion and I love
it I love the body butter by this brand
and I kept using that up so much that I
ended up getting some of these I
actually have another one of these in my
room which I'm almost out of and I'm out
of the body butter so I'm repurchasing
both of them because I need to use this
one during the daytime but if my skin is
feeling really dry or I take a shower at
night I will use the body butter they're
really expensive that's the only
downside to them but they do work I
swear to you your legs will feel amazing
so check out this brand if you have a
really dry skin so have two of these
stress relief from the bath and
Bodyworks love this so good to exfoliate
with it's just a nice sugar scrub I'm
personally a sugar scrub person instead
of a salt scrub it's just I prefer the
sugar and this has an awesome oil in it
and just make sure legs feel like butter
and I never get like cuts on my legs
anymore from shaving my neck since I've
been using this if I don't use this I
will end up like cutting my leg which
sounds really bad but I think it's just
because my legs are so dry especially
when I get into the shower sometimes so
exfoliating with this first and then
shaving has changed in my life in my
life still even better if I go and I
exfoliate with this and shave my legs
and then put like the luck suit on or
whatever you call it body butter body
lotion on is done done soft your legs
and anybody okay I have a candle in here
have burned up I've burned up more
candles but it's the only one I threw in
here is they meet me in Tahiti white
sands vanilla flower
yes smells so good it says this lush
fragrance up to heating petals
Minoo Manoa blossoms and vanilla let's
run away to paradise let's run away to
paradise it does smell really good so
this is just what the packaging looks
like it's super cute I personally love
the new packaging of the back of Body
Works can
I like the colorful frosted glasses and
they're gorgeous and I have two favorite
style shoes as those in my favorites
video okay oh look see it I'm telling
you I love this stuff go through it like
crazy I also have another macadamia deep
repair mask I always have one of these
in my prime side use that video I
actually went through two of them but
only three one and because I knew you
guys probably knew it was coming and
then I also have this Victoria's Secret
so sexy nourished healthy and hydrated
shampoo for dry damaged hair oh my god
this stuff smells so good you guys I
love the toys ecran shampoos and
conditioners especially this one I used
to use this around high school and I
just did repurchase it for a long time
because I kind of forgot about it but I
went back to the Victoria's Secret and
purchased this and like I just loved it
your hair smells so good I mean
everything and it makes my hair feel
really nice and soft as well so I love
love love the shampoo I also have the
you have long frosted glow highlighting
kit so this is where I used to lighten
the ends of my hair if you want to see a
video of me talking more about this I'll
leave it down below but I love this I
love what it did to my hair and I will
definitely need even purchasing this
because actually are you ever purchased
it so also I have a dowel a smell I went
through one of these kits from winding
lightning and I love this to whiten my
teeth
it's really easy just something to do at
home I always have coupon codes for them
down below in the description box but
yeah I love these I'm using them for
almost a year now so highly recommend
this brand if you want to do like an
at-home whitening treatment I also have
two of the body butters that I was
telling you guys about for a deluxe
teton if I'm saying that wrong I'm sorry
I don't know how they want me to say it
but you know they should have on
Sephora's website you know when you've
on dictionary.com and they have the
thing where you can click it and it
pronounces the name for you so for I
should do that was for some of their
brands like seriously so this is the
body butter the ultra rich body cream
and I love this stuff you guys it's so
good I was just going through these like
crazy so I purchased the other body
lotion which I do love but these are so
freakin awesome I also have another
shampoo in here this is the Kendra
rising shampoo hydrating formula added
for added moisture and I really did like
this shampoo a lot cleanse my hair
amazingly and it made my hair feel
really soft and smooth and smelt really
good too so I actually did for just
another one of these which I'm almost
out of it in my shower but yeah I really
do like this it is a more expensive
brand but it's an awesome brand so I
definitely recommend checking them out
and you can get this brand at Ulta I
also have another tone with body washes
the white clay and pink Jasmine I love
this then I think I've tried another
scent from them yeah pretty sure
but this is the one that I usually
always go back to right now I'm using
something different that you guys will
see in my favorites video but this is a
really nice scent and something that's
easy to pick up at the drugstore they
also have another petite dry shampoo the
one for dark hair I'm actually running
on 3rd / 4th day hair right now and you
can't even tell girl I'm telling you
before I spray this dry shampoo in my
hair it looks disgusting like my hair
gets so oily and greasy
it's disgusting this is the only
direction of who I can go like 4 or 5
days without washing my hair I wash my
body don't worry but watching my hair I
hate doing so I love this dry shampoo
I'll never go back to anything else
because this is great it's affordable
outside of this Victoria's Secret
exfoliate body prep soothing scrub love
this again it is a sugar scrub only
downside I love this because it was it
was a little bit more intense than the
one from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works so it took
off a lot more dead skin I feel like so
I liked this one for self-tanning the
only thing is I hate the packaging
because I couldn't squeeze all of it out
like it just got difficult and the
packaging is just kind of difficult to
work with once you start to get to the
end of the product but the product on
the inside is pretty awesome and I would
definitely repurchase it I would
probably have to like cut the top off or
something of course you know I have a
betta Liberata self tanner I don't think
I'll go back to anything else this is
one of my favorite self tanners ever and
I just always repurchase it I also have
this
rock stars so oh yeah I really liked the
smell of this it smells really good
pencils like bubble gum in a way
personally I don't think this is
something I want to purchase again I
don't think I'll repurchase any other
lush soaps or things like that I
personally like the shower gels more if
I'm going to wash my body but this was
nice it just smelled it really lasts as
long as I want it if I'm using a body
wash I want the smell to last for quite
a while this didn't do that for me so I
wouldn't repurchase it but it does have
a really nice scent to it so I've used
up two velour lashes guarantee you these
were the girl you crazy which is what I
have on right now I cannot step away
from the girl you crazy lashes like they
are so beautiful and full if you're
gonna get a pair lashes and you want
them to be like ba-ba-boom girl you
crazy is the best hands down I love it a
few other things I do have this kenra
platinum blow-dry spray this is the mini
mini one I really liked this as well I
will always reduce it because I love how
it protects my hair and it makes it
really really really shiny so if you've
been wondering how my hair has been like
super shiny this product does it for me
also I use that this living proof full
thickening cream it's the body boosting
volume cream this was one of the sample
will not sample sizes the word of like
these smaller sizes on Sephora but I
love this I definitely think it creates
a lot of volume and I actually like the
way my hair looks when I blow dry when I
use this product it has a lot of volume
and it just looks really good so I love
this product is awesome awesome awesome
I also have a NARS eyeshadow primer one
of the best eyeshadow primers I've ever
tried I will probably never leave this
guy because it's amazing if you guys
watched my videos for a while you know I
use this in Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre
together and I do that because if I use
the paint pot by itself my eyeshadow
will still crease I have very very oily
eyelids so it's still creased with that
no matter how little or much that I put
on which if you put too much on and
always it's going to crease more but
once I put this underneath and then put
the paint pot on top just to even out
the skin then it was perfect my eye
shadow never creases this stuff you need
it in your life
oily eyelids or just a problem with your
eyeshadow creasing it's beautiful I also
have a tea our glass of mineral veil
primer a lot of this stuff has dog hair
on it so yeah that's just my life
but this stuff is amazing I did buy the
full size after I tried the sample out
and I loved it
one of my favorite primers as well
highly recommend that you can get these
little sample guys or like smaller sizes
of a primer to on support comedy the
last thing I have is this Olay Henriksen
ultimate lift firming serum this is a
dual action firming and sculpting I use
this as I daytime serum and I really
really enjoyed it I'm currently using
one from Mac that I absolutely adore so
I think I'm just gonna go back back and
forth between this one and the map one I
will definitely be repurchasing this
though because I love wave in my skin
feel and I kept my skin super clear as
well so amazing it is amazing so that is
it for all the products I used up I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
