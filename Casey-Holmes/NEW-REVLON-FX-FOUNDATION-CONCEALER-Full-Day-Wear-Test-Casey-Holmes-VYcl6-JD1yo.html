today I'm going to be trying out a new
Atropa store and a new concealer so I'm
so excited to try actually have like a
full desk of new drugstore makeup so I'm
going to try most of it like in a
different video like I have some new
Sydney item from Maybelline maybe I'll
do like a full face of Maybelline and
show you guys these items have some new
Lizzy's which I'm going to try wanted to
use out in this video as well I don't
know which one I'm going to go with
today is going to be all about the
Revlon youth FX fill and blur foundation
they did get two shades so I have the
shades and medium beige and true beige I
thought I was gonna be one self-tan when
I filled in this video so I'm thinking
I'm going to go more with the medium
beige but this is what it looks like
it's really a thin packaging this is a
squeezy - you do get a fluid ounce which
is nice so this would be really nice to
travel with since it is so thin yeah
we're gonna be using this today as well
as the Revlon used FX the fill and blur
concealer so we're going to touch both
these out see how well they work I don't
remember how much they work but I'll put
it in here somewhere so this is the
foundation price this is the concealer
price all of mine of ulta.com in the
back it says fill and Blair Foundation
SPF 20 dramatically transformed the
appearance of lines and wrinkles and
that's pretty much it we're just gonna
roll with it and do half of my face with
a brush half of my face with a sponge
just to see which one we like better I'm
going to prime first I'm going to use my
Smashbox primer water and then the soap
&amp;amp; Glory one heck of a blot primer as
well because I do love this one this is
more of a drugstore primer this is by
far my favorite drugstore primer that I
have found and I always use primer water
so I want to give it a fair shot for the
foundation also I grab the same intro if
you're not subscribed be sure to
subscribe and let me know down below in
the comments of what video you would
like to see next or if there's any other
new drugstore products that you've had
your eye on let me know in the comments
and it will definitely check them out
okay so like I said we're going to go in
with this line this is the 240 medium
beige a sick foundation from what I can
tell like that is thick and I'm just
going to use this Tarte brush and we're
going to take it on one side of my face
with a brush this is super thick like
look at this
and this has pre great coverage and it's
actually really good match the little
pinky for me but it's not bad and take a
little bit more in here it does feel
kind of sick there is a little bit of
redness peeking through right here and
when I get like the sponge will help
with that I think looks pretty good and
has a more radiant finish like a nice
glowy finish will say I did use that
full drop on only one half of my face so
just keep that in mind I do have a
boyish right here and of course my
organization right here is peeking
through that is one side with a brush
one side and no foundation but now I'm
going to use my L'Oreal sponge which you
guys know I love actually purchased
another one last night so I have three
of them tough it out mmm I feel like
there's more coverage on the brush side
okay I feel like a little bit longer to
blend out just a little bit less
coverage if you've been watching me for
a while you know I'm not like a brush
person normally but lately I've been
coming a brush girl with the estructura
foundations on Hawaii I feel like
everything just blends really well with
the covergirl vitalist foundation I love
this it cosmetics heavenly love brush
and then I'll like go over get with my
sponge tutorial one and then with this
one I mean this Tarte brush works out
really well and it's also enough you can
see it right here but it's kind of
breaking up on my nose so let's try to
cover that up so the sponge kind of
helped with that so I wouldn't say it's
like necessarily super full coverage
it's just more medium I don't know that
I have to say I do still kind of like
the covergirl vitalist foundation more
just because it has more coverage and I
just like the way it looks on my skin a
little bit better I do feel like this
looks really nice it's very radiant I'm
not obsessed you know just not just yet
let's go ahead and try to concealer it's
the Revlon each big still and wear
concealer so it's basically the same
line and it says it has optical
diffusers
and it says you can see results
instantly immediately corrects the
appearance of dark circles lines and
wrinkles which is what we all want so
that it looks like right there and this
is me - very interesting - so it is a
clicky pin now this is very yellow in
foundations like super pink so hopefully
it's nice this reminds me of the instant
age rewind by Maybelline instant age
rewind is the risk of you know had a
bigger applicator there we go so yellow
this is in the shade light hopefully
this will kind of cover up some that
redness and brighten this up a bit I
always put a good bit of concealer on
just cuz I roll
I feel like this blends really well but
it's not full coverage I can still see
some darkness right in here unless you
guys can really tell it did help with my
lid just to even it out a bit but I
can't say I'm in love with it I also
really love the Maybelline fit me
concealer it is a really great concealer
and I was recommended that over this one
just has a little bit more coverage I
have a hard time loving Revlon
foundations I don't know what it is but
it's hard for me to find one that I just
messed with
I feel like this isn't as full as I want
because in person I still see some
redness right here it could just be life
because they're so bright typically I'm
going to set it I'm going to use this
cover FX powder it's just a little
powder like this and I'm just going use
a regular brush I'm not going to bake or
anything going to tap it in there move
set the whole face because the whole
face is pretty sticky and it's starting
on as you can see right here it's
starting to when I sweat my eyes you can
see it settling into my wrinkles can
look it's like creasing in my lid you
see that that's definitely the concealer
it's definitely not a good way to start
especially since I haven't finished our
makeup yet i'ma go ahead finish up the
rest of my make
and then I will be fast to give you guys
the final update okay guys so I'm back
this is what the foundation looks like
after I have the rest of my face makeup
on I'm not obsessed with it I don't
think it it's just not what I like I
feel like it doesn't really slide on my
skin I feel like when I place makeup on
top of it everything just kind of was
hard to blend and I think because it was
so sticky even though I said it with a
powder I'm still having a hard time like
blending bronzer really well my contour
as well the highlight looks really good
the highlight I'm wearing actually is
the Maybelline master chrome and this is
nice like my nose I feel like is showing
quite a bit of texture it's still
breaking up right here in the center and
of course here on my cheeks I'm not too
thrilled at how the foundation look I'm
still going to rights out the day freeze
eyes let you see how it works and it is
150 right now hope you guys I've dated
throughout the day and I will see you
guys in my next chicken okay so I
quickly wanted to show you guys what
this foundation looks like in natural
lighting and not um you know with all
the big heavy lights that I have now
this is what it looks like it also
doesn't look that bad ice and I can
natural lighting I feel like it looks
much more smoother on my skin than when
I thought so so far actually a natural
light I prefer it more but that's the
fun part of these videos is you get to
kind of see like when you like it
because sometimes things look better in
studio lights and then when you get out
and natural light you're like whoa Phil
is kind of breaking up right here on my
nose if you guys can see but other than
that it's working so right now I'm
actually headed to the gym we're going
to see how it holds up it's a very
interesting day it's like sprinkling and
it's kind of humid it's not that cold
it's not that hot
better than between 63 degrees right now
so we'll see how it lasts all right so I
figured I would give you guys an update
really quickly on the foundation is 412
now and we just go back to the gym a too
long ago and I've had protein shake and
molds acts like the foundations actually
loading up very well I was sweating
profusely there you go
and somehow the foundation stayed on
like I was a little nervous it was going
to have like some streaks on my forehead
or something especially after I bought
in my face and for sure thought it would
start breaking up but it hasn't it is
not yet which is very surprising and
nice and still glowing to highlight
Salon lip products still on in my
opinion it lasted through my Stairmaster
workout and that's pretty intense so
doing well so far
do you like the foundation does it look
like I have like doesn't it's a heavy
it's like a heavy feeling Foundation
does it look heavy like if you look
cakey so I feel like I look better in
natural light than it does in the studio
light so we'll see how it wears
throughout the rest of the day okay guys
so I'm back and I'm here to do my final
check-in and let you guys know what I
think about the foundation so it is
10:28 now and I've had us all for a
little while it's been through just a
little bit you know I went worked out
and did some things around the house
just a mud packing and all that and this
is what's looking like I have not
powdered since I first applied my makeup
so I feel like it could look worse
oily wise on my skin because I haven't
blotted or anything like that it is
breaking up along my forehead here also
here on my nose and on my chin which I
don't really like at all I know I'm
gonna break up on my nose I don't
remember rubbing my nose all I don't
normally rub my face somehow that
happened and I do like it but I will say
it's not as long wearing as the
covergirl one that I was loving when did
just break up a little too much for me I
think it is a good foundation though
especially a natural lighting it did
look really good but personally it just
did not last that well my skin I mean
I'm not going to get rid of it I'll
still use it but I definitely do prefer
some different drugstore foundations
over this one bit quickly I'm going to
add just a touch of powder to show you
guys what it looks like when you modify
it again I would recommend a blotting
sheet but those are my purse she's
downstairs failing my bronzers kind of
faded away but have a little bit right
in here that highlights day to put again
that is the Maybelline master chrome
this is the gold one very nice so yeah
looks like when you powder so you could
blight and powder and make everything
look a little bit better but again the
problem I had is just the size that is
breaking up all over the place and then
also for the concealer I'm not the
biggest fan of it I just don't like the
color first off the color light is very
yellow like super super yellow it's more
like a medium coverage concealer and it
really did sink into my lines if I did
not set it like you need to set it
immediately make sure you set it to
really well I would even recommend
baking what Balan just because you
really want that powder to sink in there
and make sure it doesn't crease so I
think that's all I have for you guys let
me know if you've tried any of these
down below in the comments I would love
to hear how great to give this video a
thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe
before you leave and I will see you guys
