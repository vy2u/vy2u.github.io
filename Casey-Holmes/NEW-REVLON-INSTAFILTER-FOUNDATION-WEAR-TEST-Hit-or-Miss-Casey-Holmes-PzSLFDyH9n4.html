to be doing a wear test on a new
drugstore foundation and it is the
Revlon Photoready insta filter
foundation and everybody is really going
off of the Instagram theme with having
really a perfect skin in real life but
that's okay because I love when
foundations claim to be full coverage
give you a flawless finish because
that's what I look for in a foundation
anyways I want to look good on an off
camera you know I'm saying I figured I
would go ahead and just do like a wear
test with this and not a first
impressions I did film a first
impressions I just didn't complete it
because we went out that night and then
I went to bed and I didn't finish it I
figured why not do a wear test I know
you guys like those as well so that's
what we're gonna be doing today so if
you're interested in seeing my thoughts
on this foundation and then definitely
keep watching and don't forget to
subscribe before you leave so let's just
go ahead and get started so I've just
been using my favorite primers with this
we have the Smashbox primer water and
also D Natasha Genoa magic primer first
time I tried it was with this primer and
I haven't changed it since like you guys
know I love the Canon Austin mattifying
primer but since I've been loving that
it's motion to know no one so much with
it I've just been sticking with it and
that's how I'm gonna demonstrate it for
you today so I'm gonna go ahead and just
put my hair back and apply the primer
water first and then this one in my
t-zone and we're putting this to the
test today because I have to travel
today and travel is always a huge test
for me with like foundations and stuff
because we really get to see if it lasts
well on my oily skin normally when I'm
traveling I don't have time to blow like
I'm not blotting my face you know I'm
not saying there's Airport line like
blotting away or in the car driving just
really expect my foundations to last and
not make me super oily and to not break
up on me so that's what we're testing
today like when I first tried this when
we were going out it lasted really well
on our night out like it was very very
nice if you're wondering my hands are
lighter than my chest because for some
reason my self tanner just doesn't last
long
on my hands I think it's just because I
wash my hands so much so I want to say
when I first tried out this foundation I
looked online and it had two reviews and
two and a half stars and I was like oh
no that is not good it is $17.99 a piece
which is super expensive I think they
could definitely lower that price down I
mean this is supposed to be a drugstore
brand but they are probably the highest
priced drugstore brand that I have come
across at least
Sene Maybelline got a little bit pricey
with their Judy but I think that's just
because they collide with her but for
the most part they stay on the more
affordable side I've long has definitely
been raising their prices don't know why
but they're definitely more expensive
now than they used to be but right now
on Ulta they're having a buy one get one
50% off and in this foundation you have
three six nine twelve different shades
so you don't have too many to choose
from but there are twelve shades it says
that the Revlon Photoready ends to
filter foundation is a flawless finish
foundation with a built in blender to
make you look as good in person as you
do online the sponge applicator makes it
easy to blend foundation the innovative
formula works with your skin type to
even smooth skin tone full range of high
definition shades fresh face natural
finish medium buildable coverage high
definition filter technology captures
and transforms any light to blur and
soften flaws leaving the perfect app
filter look and its SPF 20 all-day wear
I personally like to apply this with a
brush I feel like the blender is just
like so it's so pointless like there's
no sense and even applying your
foundation with it what's the sponge did
to me is it gave me more light coverage
and it was super streaky like it could
not get it even base with it it just
wasn't my favorite also when you have
this you need to keep the top of this
foundation if you shake this without the
top it is going to get absolutely
everywhere because it just comes out the
little hole right here and it'll just
get all over your clothes I've already
done that if you follow me on snapchat
I had like foundation all over and I was
like cool so make sure you keep this top
otherwise shaking it is just gonna suck
because it's gonna get absolutely
everywhere you do need to shake this
foundation to mix it all up and the way
you dispense it is just twisting this
when the top is off and it comes out the
low hole onto this find the actual
packaging I do like this packaging I
feel like we could have just gone with a
pump though you know what I mean I think
this foundation just works better with a
brush I have two different shades we
have 3:30 in natural tan 240 medium
beige and I just went from one spectrum
to another's I'm going to be going more
for the medium beige to 40 but I might
mix in a little bit of 330 I'm just
gonna be using this Smashbox brush which
is the full coverage foundation brush so
I'm gonna go ahead and shake this up
again do not shake this up without the
top it'll be a it'll be a mess yeah
it is really messy on the sponge as you
can see but I'm just gonna twist them
out you can see it come out there I'm
just gonna put some on the back of my
hand actually you just gonna go with
2:44 now I feel like this will be okay
for me my PA could shave 3:30 was even
too dark for me when I was super self
tan so I had to mix the two to get like
my perfect color instead of buying a
shade that's in between these I'm just
gonna stick with having these two mix in
them because this one also oxidize on my
skin just keep that in mind
I feel like this foundation does oxidize
quite a bit I would go maybe like a
shade below what your natural shade is
and just see how that works for you but
I'm gonna go ahead and take this fun or
this sponge I'm gonna take this brush
and do half my face so you guys can see
what it looks like this is a very very
lightweight formula and I feel like it
blends out very well and even throughout
the day it is just so it's just so
lightweight I will say I feel like you
have to use quite a bit of product to
get full coverage you definitely want to
press it in where you need extra
coverage so for me that's in this area
where I have rosacea so I just press it
in there it does set very quickly and it
goes to like a powdery matte finish it
looks really pretty on the skin even up
close it just looks really really nice
it doesn't look heavy even though I did
have to use quite a bit of product it
doesn't look super cakey the only thing
with using a ton of product is that it
just sucks because this is a seventeen
dollar foundation from the drugstore so
it's like I feel like you have to go in
with quite a bit on your brush so that
way you can really work with it and
blend it out so it's not streaky I feel
like the applicator on this foundation
just soaks up all of this product
because it is such a thin consistency it
just what took it all away so that's why
I really recommend a brush to blend it
out because otherwise you're gonna be
sitting there forever trying to get
foundation on your face I mean it's
already kind of a process with the brush
it's a really hard product to recommend
because it's so expensive it's not even
a fluid ounce it's kind of hard to blend
out but it looks nice on the skin this
is what it looks like on the skin it dry
very quickly you can build it up to full
coverage you can also have medium
right if you wanted to so I did use
quite a bit of product to get this
coverage but this is what it looks like
and it does set down to like a powdery
finish like give it a little bit to dry
and it will set down to like this
powdery matte finish concealers and
everything like that lays on top of it
really beautifully powders look really
great on top of it as well so what I'm
gonna do is go ahead and finish up my
face and then I'll come back and show
you guys my completed makeup look and
then take you throughout my busy day
that I have today okay so I'm back I
finished with my makeup and what I used
was the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder to set it all down and
then I used the new Victoria Beckham
Estee Lauder bronzer is 0-2 is this new
NYX which I just showed in my Ulta haul
that you guys have already seen should
have seen it before this one the NYX is
three steps to sculpt I use this to
contour and use the yellow tone - like
carve out my contour and then to
highlight I used this on Nastasia glow
kit and i used mainly starbursts but i
did add a little bit of marshmallow in
there as well for lip color i did use
the smashbox always-on liquid lip and
just orderly and i just really like this
color this is what the makeup looks like
in the foundation i think it looks
really good I mean even up close my
pores are not accentuated at all I just
think it looks really good the one thing
I will say is I am a little dry on my
forehead right now I'm not too sure why
but it looks a little bit like it's
clinging to certain dry patches that I
have on my forehead so what I would
recommend is if you don't have oily skin
if you have dry skin I would stay away
from this one I think it would really
accentuate your dry skin but if you have
like combo skin with some dry patches I
would really make sure to exfoliate and
like moisturize those areas and just
make sure that it's nice and smooth for
the foundation otherwise it looks really
great like from here down it's like
flawless and it just looks really really
good again it is so lightweight this is
what the color looks like after it kind
of set on my skin I will say it went to
more of like a pinky tone which I don't
really like but I think with concealer
and everything else put on you can't
really tell too much so anyways that's
our first update and I'm gonna take you
guys throughout my day right now it is
2:14 so it's a little bit later but I do
have a long day ahead so I figured I'll
take you guys along with me I'll show
you it natural lighting and everything
like that and we'll just see how it
wears so yeah I will see you guys in my
next update so I just made it to my
hotel how pretty is this Oh finally a
hotel with a selfie mirror and then we
have this beautiful chandelier the bed
I'm just here for one night but I love
it this I'm currently uploading right
now it is 1018 and I was going to let me
show you it's 19 I was gonna show you
guys an update on the foundation when I
was on my way to the airport but since
it gets dark so late I ran out of time
it just ate a turkey sandwich so my lip
color got on my chin which is really
strange for Smashbox liquid lips so you
normally don't transfer like that so I'm
a little confused lies down here it's
like completely off though I'm gonna
show you guys just a little bit closer
for the best lighting in the world but
it's actually not doing too bad I
actually like it I haven't powdered
again I'm sure if I put more powder on
it would look even better just kind of
let it do its thing
oh this is messing me up right here yeah
right now still going strong I think it
doesn't look like super oily or
anything's really nothing likes too bad
I'm you know how long has it been it's
10 19 it's been quite a few hours but
I'm gonna wait for a couple more hours
and fix this makeup and then I'll be
back to finish off this whole wear test
and let you know what my thoughts are
hey guys so I'm here for my last update
for the night I did just take my lip sex
in the cities on I'm in New York it's
only appropriate actually the last
update I'm gonna do because I've got to
go to bed I have to be up in like a few
hours I don't know why I'm still up so
it is 156 right now but definitely
started to get a little cakey here in
this area look a little heavy but it's
not terrible let me see if
like lots of this in the tissue and this
is how it looked the last time I tried
it as well so you get some product that
comes off oh yeah it kind of starts to
separate I feel like it's not terrible
but again it's one of those things that
you're gonna have to decide if you want
to purchase because it is so expensive I
like it I don't think it's I mean how
long has it been it's been like 12 hours
now 10:10 it's like 10 hours it didn't
do bad at all it did great on the
airplane I normally get super oily in my
t-zone after a flight and I didn't get
that oily after my flight today I didn't
even belong after my flight but I have
heard like I posted my drugstore haul
just a few minutes ago and I had some
people saying that they absolutely hated
the foundation and I will say if you
like if you have dry skin I would just
not even touch it with a ten-foot pole
because I feel like it will clean - all
your dry patches patches I feel like
it'll cling to all your dry patches and
you would just absolute it would I
recommend it I mean there's a difference
between liking it and recommending it I
feel like I like it but I don't know if
I should recommend it because it is so
expensive you have to use a lot of
product you don't even get it fluid out
so I'm gonna say you could pass on it I
mean there's more cons and pros but if
you want to try it out I recommend
trying it out wet and wild like what
five or six dollars this was almost 18
and the wet mud one last just as well as
this one did it looks a little bit
better on the skin so G if you want to
try it or not it's not the worst thing
that's ever happened to the drugstore
it's actually not a bad foundation I'm
gonna continue to use it and they did
purchase them it's not a must-have in my
opinion so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'm thinking about filming I don't
know if I'm gonna do it yet because all
I have here is the vlog camera and I'm
literally going home tomorrow but
actually I think I'll film it later in
the week but I haven't knew who to be
foundation I am I've been testing out
for you guys so I was like oh y'all do
my test tomorrow because I have a lot of
meetings to go to I think I'm just gonna
do a wear test when I'm back at home
because I feel like I'll just forget
tomorrow I'm gonna be like halfway
asleep the entire day stay tuned for
that one I also have the LA girl or
like colors things Mele colors new
foundation but all the colors that I got
look a little busted so I don't know the
charades are gonna match me but we all
seem so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you found it somewhat
helpful I know I kind of went back and
forth I don't know I just feel like at
the end of the day I really have to
think about the pros and cons and weigh
them out and to me there was just more
cons than pros so anyways I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video which will be on
Sunday bye guys
triple a credits alright hang up the
phone and let your heartbreak only</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
