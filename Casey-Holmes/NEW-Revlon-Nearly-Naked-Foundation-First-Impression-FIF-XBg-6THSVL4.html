a first impression on the Revlon nearly
naked foundation and I've had a ton of
requests for this especially when it
first came out but I kind of wanted to
just let everybody do their reviews and
first impressions on it before you know
I did mine there's so many reviews out
about the foundation but I'm still
interested in trying it so I thought I'd
do that today I know it's gonna do the
Physicians Formula BB cream but I wanted
to try this instead so it's the Revlon
nearly naked foundation I got mine in
medium beige and if it's too dark I did
get shell beige just to kind of mix with
it it has SPF 20 ok so what I'm going to
do is take a medium beige I'm going to
apply it with my Beauty Blender and
we're just gonna see how well it applies
I'm gonna shake it up I don't like that
there's not a pump that kind of sucks
but it'll be okay okay so that's them on
the back of my hand and I'm just gonna
put some on my Beauty Blender dab it on
my skin
so far I think it has like a nice
coverage it's just kind of evening out
my skin tone and this foundation is also
$10 if you grab that line for $10 then I
got them BOGO when I got on the other
one
okay so after putting it along I like it
I think it has a nice finish I mean it's
not nothing out of the ordinary I feel
like I still really love the covergirl
outlast so far I think it's a little bit
better at covering just kind of looks
like you evened out my skin tone and it
doesn't look that bad so far I'm liking
it I think it looks really good as
always I do set my foundation so because
I have really oily skin and I'm not
gonna not set my foundations I said that
before so I will put powder on okay now
I put powder on I've got a bronzer blush
everything like that and I'm really
excited to see how it goes throughout
the day I think it looks really good so
far and I like it
whenever you bronze up the skin and
everything it just kind of brings the
whole face together so I have everything
on other than my eye makeup which I'll
probably do at work because I'm kind of
late right now so the time is 8:37 and
yes I should be back home around 6:00
6:30 probably at 6:30 I get off at 6:00
so I'll be home around then and I will
update you guys on the foundation
hey guys so I'm back and it is now seven
oh one or two now and I think it's
lasted really well now you can kind of
see at this point I am a little bit
shiny in my t-zone and it's just a
little a little too shiny for me but
this foundation has lasted really well
throughout the day anyways so I'm really
loving it so far it hasn't like gotten
splotchy on my skin or anything like
that only thing I've been doing is
blotting my face 12 o'clock was the
first time I did my little update and
went and checked on my foundation and I
said foundation looks great and I don't
have to powder so I didn't powder
anything like that I just went out
throughout the day at 1:30 I powdered
and it said still look great it got a
little bit oily in my t-zone so I just
powdered up and I was good to go if
you're wondering what powder I use to
blot my face I use the Maybelline Dream
matte powder and then the last update
idea was at 5:20 I said I bought at
t-zone and did not apply powder and here
we are two almost two hours later and
it's about time for me to powder up
because it's a little too oily but so
far the foundation lasted really great
throughout the day I honestly didn't
expect a great result out of this
foundation now I would say if you're
super oily like me you know you do want
to keep a powder in your purse just make
sure you can blot and just powder out
just to kind of keep the freshness of
the foundation if you have dry skin I
think this will be really nice with the
foundation on you when I first put it on
I kind of was like I know I said it
wasn't anything special I didn't feel
like but as I wore it throughout the day
I feel like it just sunk into my skin
and really set and my bronzer and blush
a stayed on pretty well throughout this
day so that's really great also yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know if you've tried this foundation
down below in the comments and if so let
me know what kind of skin you have as
well and how it works on you and thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoy and I will see you guys in my next
video bye
long reach Thank You aunt Minnie Detroit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
