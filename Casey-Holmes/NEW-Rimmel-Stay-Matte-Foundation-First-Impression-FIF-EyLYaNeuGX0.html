a first impression on this Rimmel stay
matte foundation I've been really
interested in trying this ever since I
got it but I wanted to do a first
impression and I know I did like a poll
my last video on if you wanted a first
impression on the BB cream from went
wild or the Too Faced mascara but I
decide to go ahead and do it on this
foundation because I was ready to open
it up and I figured maybe a lot of you
were interested to see how this worked I
did already primed my face with the
Rimmel stay matte primer do you have it
on now
it did mattify my skin really nicely
we're just going to see if it can hold
up throughout the day with the
foundation so I'm using the color stand
as most vino I do have rosacea actually
have a breakout right here too
this is a lightweight shine control
liquid mousse foundation it says
feather-light liquid mousse blends
flawlessly for natural-looking all-day
shine control silky smooth formula at
least perfectly leaves a perfectly matte
baby soft finish lightweight texture
won't feel heavy or greasy so to apply
this today I'm going to be using this
the four mineral powder okay so this is
what the foundation looks like you can
see that it is a pretty moosie
foundation it's not moving it's not
runny we're going to do one side and see
the difference between the two keep in
mind is darker than my actual face but
it's going to hopefully match my body
very well
okay so the color is a little off but
this is what it looks like on this side
it did cover fairly nicely and it is
really lightweight I don't know if I
want to do another at the patient of it
because it looks pretty nice I mean
there's a little bit of redness peeking
through but not too much the only thing
I will say I don't like so far is that
it is sinking into my pores and making
them look very large so that that can be
a complete nono for me I'm going to go
ahead and do the other side you can see
I have all this redness and I break out
everything we're going to see that
covers it up yeah the colors just off so
we'll - pink for me so that is the
application of it it does apply fairly
easily it it kind of feels like you're
not blending anything into your skin so
it is pretty lightweight I didn't use
too much there's quite a bit still on
the back of my hand and it did leave a
pretty nice full coverage finish again
it is sinking into my pores I absolutely
hate foundations at senior time pores um
this primer did kind of minimize the
pores at first but then putting this
foundation on top it just like brought
them back to life which completely sucks
so I it just really bothers me that my
pores are very visible right now um but
I'm going to go ahead and do the rest of
my makeup and do my hair and then I'm
going to come back and let you guys know
what I think okay so this is what the
foundation looks like after I've set my
makeup my bronzer and concealer and
stuff on and I do like the finish of it
I think from far away it does look
really nice but like I said I want to
get up close my pores are just so big
and I can't I can't take it like while I
was putting on like my concealer and
stuff I was thinking man I want to take
this off so bad because the one thing
that will really turn me off about the
foundation is if it makes my pores look
big because that's just not anything
anybody wants and I haven't
the foundation lately that makes my
pores look really big so I'm not used to
it you know distracting me lately but
now with this foundation I'm just like
oh this is the reason why I don't try
mousse foundations because I tried the
Revlon Colorstay whipped foundation
didn't like that and now this one like
it has really great covered I have to
say it does keep you matte it does feel
really lightweight so that's really
awesome and I am going to update you
guys later in the day on how it looks
after a few hours and if it still keeps
me matte so I'm still going to go
through with the video is 241 now and
yeah I'll be back in just a little bit
to give you guys an update so it is now
8 to 34 and it's been a few hours since
I put this foundation on I think I did
in about two right but this foundation
is going strong I've just noticed that I
had some shyness right here in this area
this is always where I get shiny first
and then I'll get signee on my chin and
my forehead but the shininess is not
anything that I'm like oh my gosh it's
horrible it's not mad at all I don't
have a problem with it it's just like a
little bit of shine that I would much
rather go ahead and blow off my face
just so it doesn't like paddle up with
the foundation and I mean I do like it -
the color being off I was looking at
some footage because I went ahead and
reddit 'add the first part of this video
and it doesn't look like the colors off
but in person this is foundation is a
lot more pink than my self tanner so
it's definitely a little off but you
know I went through throughout the day
and I did go to the gym and stuff with
this foundation on and it's held up very
very well it's still fairly matte and
you can see that my blush my bronzer and
my highlighter are still on I think it's
a really big deal if a jokester
foundation hold up through like working
out going out and just like not being
able to block I have not blotted or
powdered at all since I put on this
foundation so so far I'm really liking
these two together I think they're
really nice I'm honestly not going
anywhere else out in the day so I'm
going to end the video here I feel like
if you don't have larger pores you would
really like this because it won't sink
into your pores make them look humongous
but I have larger pores so whenever
foundations do see
into them it's very annoying but I mean
from distance like I said earlier it
does look really great just up close
it's like oh hi pores there you are I
can't really say if I would continue to
use this it just depends I might have to
try it with my benefit Porefessional and
see if that helps but sometimes you know
primers don't necessarily help when the
foundation just wants to sink right in
there and just not say on the surface
but I have to say I do like this primer
it is a thicker consistency it's like a
cream kind of thing and it's a little
bit tacky as well which is pretty much
the whole stay matte part of it because
there's just a white cream and you rub
it in and it's just like a really kind
of thicker tacky moisturizer but once
it's in it's clear and it makes your
skin nice and matte so I would recommend
this I would actually recommend both of
these do you guys saw I barely used
anything on each part of my face and it
still had a ton left over and it is a
very very lightweight foundation like it
did not bother me at all throughout the
day so I will leave a more information
about these down below like the color
range the price if I can find all that
stuff I will leave it in the description
box as well if you've tried these
products please let me know what you
think of them in the comments below if
you have larger pores and you've found a
way to make this foundation work for you
then totally let me know in the comments
