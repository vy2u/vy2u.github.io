today I'm going to be trying a new brand
that just launched at Sephora not too
long ago and I'm so excited to test them
out because they have some of the cutest
packaging that I have seen in a really
long time now they do have a price tag
to go along with that packaging but very
very pretty I have high hopes for this
I'm going in with like an open positive
mind I'm so excited to try these out
brand is called pretty vulgar cosmetics
I just put cosmetics at the end but it's
called pretty vulgar and I have a bunch
of different things they don't have too
many options on this site right now I
mean they did just launch but they do
have a little bit of everything so if
you want to try out a couple different
things just see if you like it then you
can do that but I have one two three
four five six seven eight nine can live
in twelve thirteen things to try for you
today very excited as you can see I mean
the packaging is just adorable so I
can't wait to see how the products works
we're just going to start with what I
have in my hand which is the eye shadow
I'm going to go ahead and put on my
primer if this is a Smashbox lid primer
in light so using my viewfinder as a
mirror right now this is a pretty vulgar
Nightingale eyeshadow palette it says
have all eyes on you with Nightingale
our twelve shades palette with colors
meticulously chosen to create a deep
sultry look formulated for long-wear our
highly saturated blendable matte and
pearl key hewed eyeshadows are perfect
for a night out this is what the
packaging looks like it's so pretty you
guys I love it like how do you want to
get rid of this but I like after you
open it this is these box it just looks
like a little book so gorgeous and it
says hashtag free the bird and then you
open it up and it looks like this so
this is the one that I got of course the
neutrals because I wanted to make sure
that I use this palette because it ain't
cheap I'm going to take the shade
nocturnal this is a nice matte cream I'm
just going to set my primer on my eyes
just so we have a nice smooth base to
work with then I'm going to go in with
the shade hide-and-seek right here which
is more of a cool toned transition shade
and I'm going to fluff this into the
crease we're just going to do something
fairly easy today just to kind of test
out a little bit of these eye shadows
little seems pretty seems like that's
lending pretty well so you can
definitely build this color up to a
little bit deeper but I really like it
okay so that shade went on really nicely
I'm going to go in with dark side right
here with that same brush and do the
same thing but dull a little bit below
that first shade we used don't want to
go above the first shade I'm going to
blend this out from inner to outer
corner so this is definitely more like a
cool toned pallet it has some really
pretty shades in here okay I'm going on
with a smaller blending brush I'm going
to take this shade flip out now I'm
going to go right on it second shade
that we just put on so we're working on
having a nice like gradient effect here
but I am leaving the center of the lid a
little bit more open and then they do
have a really pretty black in here so
I'm going to take a smaller blending
brush this is the Mac 239 and this is
called all-nighter I'm just going to do
this right on top that Brown just a
little bit right here the outer corner a
little bit in the crease and right in
here so much for a simple look today
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to take this Mac 242 and I'm going to go
in with clutch clutch looks so pretty at
this color right here I'm just going to
put this in the center of my lid this is
know what glitter glue or anything is
Justin eyeshadow by itself looks really
pretty
that is the eyeshadow look right there I
think these are really pretty definitely
more of like a smoky palette okay so now
I'm going to use one of the liners this
is the pretty vulgar on point liquid
eyeliner pen how pretty isn't it so much
try this out into the shade 26 she's
just a nice black oh this is cute look
at that sounds like a old school seem so
fancy and it's a salt tip really excited
about that and it's not too long
see 2 min very nice actually really like
this felt tip because it's a great size
and it does have some flexibility to it
but it's not too flexible where you're
going to get a liner all over the place
and then so black so black it looks so
so good really impressed with this
look I say that and now I'm coming off
one thing I will say is I'm noticing
that if it gets some eyeliner on it it
doesn't want to work as well what is
going on I'm just doing so freaking good
now's like not want to go on my own okay
so now this is being like a big pain in
my ass not good like I'm trying to get
some of my hands to kind of get it going
and it works a little bit but it's not
working as well as I wish it was yeah
this is not working for me now we've got
our liner on I don't know if the eye
shadow affected the salt tip and like
having the product actually come out on
my eyes but definitely had to finish it
off with a different liner because it
was not wanting to come out of associate
pen okay so now that I saw on I'm going
to use the bird's nest' blurring Beauty
mousse and it says multitask with our
amazing bird's nests of blurring Beauty
mousse that works as a all-in-one
moisturizer moisturizer primer and
lightweight foundation transcending from
a light covers the skin smoothing
foundation to a featherweight second
skin application if use of diamond
powder to enhance skin luminosity and
decreased visibility of fine lines and
wrinkles this pore minimizing anti aging
movement is it easy to put your best
face forward all day long that's true 24
might be a little light but it'll be
okay again
this is the packaging that looks like
ooh this is not what I expected so this
is it right there
so again this would be an all-in-one
product a primer moisturizer and
lightweight foundation okay so I'm going
to try it with a Beauty Blender first
and then I'll go in with a brush if I'm
not liking it pump it out onto the back
of my hand so does have a pump on it
will look super dark I don't know if
that's gonna work for me oh that's
way too dark Wow on line that's what it
looks like it looks like just a nice tan
color and it's the second to darkest
shade it's very warm just a little FYI
but the color right below it is pretty
light but I'm guessing in person it's
not going to be that light I don't have
this two colors I mean look you have
between this one and this one I for sure
thought was in we can go look at this
online it looks like it would match me
but definitely not so just be full
warrant and they only
one two three four five six shades okay
so if that might be on a style mat
foundation on right now and it looks a
little dark but a post it matches my
body so weird maybe it's the glow on my
chest that's making me look lighter this
was in the shade 0-5 but now I'm going
to go in with the pretty folder under
cover concealer and I got the shade six
- which I'm thinking the numbers on the
packaging are not on the side because I
think I ordered different shades so
let's hope this is good ooh
so just comes in a little - but like
this probably the simplest packaging
I've seen yet I like the dosa applicator
so we're just going to apply this as a
good color apply this underneath our
eyes it's that kind of color that's not
too dark or too light and the Dhokla
AppleCare actually holds quite a bit of
product on it which is really nice I'm
going to use my blender to blend this
out this concealer will also kind of
lighten up the face feel like this is a
medium coverage concealer where is my
washer not accentuating pores or texture
and it's really blending out very
quickly kind of wiping this a lot I like
the color too for having a tan and it's
just a really nice natural looking
finish doesn't look to take care
anything and I took quite a bit of
concealer on so I did not see any
powders on their website so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to set to my
space and I'm going to apply my lashes
as well and then we'll come back and
have some brow products blushes bronzers
highlighters all of that okay so now in
fact I got my lashes on I'm going to go
ahead and dust away the baking that I
did I just used the Maybelline master
fix setting powder you should adjust
that away go give it some nice smooth
finish I also got lash glue right here
and I tried to fix it and I made it
worse so don't mind that I'm going to
take this pretty vulgar eyebrow gel in
the shade 38 and we're going to put this
on a brow I really need to bronze
I'm going to bronze my chest really
quickly because this is throwing me off
I'm going to use my ELF brush to apply
this
what the top looks like it's also good
there we go right there and then that is
the shade looks like a good shape again
this is in the shape 38 it was really
nice it's like not as thick as most
eyebrow containers like it's a really
thin little thing right here and I just
feel it's really nice I had a lot of
product in it
oh it's creamy so I'm going to go in my
brush you can see how creamy it is like
I didn't mean to dig into it it happen I
really like this brow product and I
really like the color of it so you
didn't work with next thing we're going
to do is we are going to contour I'm
going to use that pretty vulgar bronze
be if called son of a be sick word says
on the back of study and I'm just going
to contour my face with this and I'm
going to use this torch brush right here
just to contour the same a little bit
goes a long way fYI like a really nice
color
whew likes that blending out really well
I tore a little bit of my forehead
blends so well then for blush I have the
make them blush in the shade sweet
revenge coming in the same kind of
package contour is so nice it's kind
like that same packaging it's so pretty
and then is the shade oh my gosh I love
that color oh that so it's just a really
pretty slush make a little peachy slush
cool so that's really nice and then I'm
going to take the shimmering Swan
glimmer of BS this is the highlighter I
think the names are so funny that's why
I guess it's called pretty vulgar though
I like the names I feel like it just
goes along with the theme and this
highlighter looks so pretty again this
is glimmer of BS aka Bowl shoes we're
just going to highlight the face
does look like when you go to blend it
out that it kind of blends it away so
just keep that in mind
I always blend my highlighters but this
one looks like it's just kind of
blending away yeah I don't think I'm
filling the highlighter after I just
blended it out mmm I'm just going to go
in with my spotlight Pro palette and
apply the lightest shade and to talk to
my cheeks so I'm going to use their
crayon liner in the shade confidential
wow that is so black and it's so pretty
hopefully that doesn't run on their eyes
or on my eyes but now I'm going to do is
I'm going to go in with flip-out and a
pencil brush and just smudge this to
blend that's underneath that lower lash
line crazy black another thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to use the feathers
mascara and this is in the Raven this is
so pretty I showed this on my snapchat
I'm not able to put on my top lashes
just because I did go with falsies and
look at how beautiful this is this is
like an art piece okay
so stunning any comments below all the
pins comment letting you know way think
about this from because I'm going to
wear it by itself one day I'm thinking
this is going to be very volumizing
somebody's is poisonous pout this is a
plumping lip gloss in the shade secret
weapon I don't normally use plumping lip
gloss this is gorgeous like my goals
having floral on the top of your lip
gloss so I'm going to put this on and
then we're going to highlight our brow
but I want to see if it's like hurt so
now I'm a big baby when it comes to
plumping things so this is on really
pretty color the Too Faced lip
injections are freaking ridiculously
painful so hopefully this is not like
that so let's see if it hurts I feel it
I feel it working but it feels like a
cooling sensation not like a stinging
one okay so the lip gloss is definitely
not painful it's just more like a really
cooling sensation I kind of feel like I
have really cold air blowing on my lips
you know it's nothing too crazy I will
go through every
really quickly the eyeshadow I did
really like um it's definitely more of a
smokey eye palette but it does have some
really pretty shades in here but when I
say it's probably going to be my
all-time favorite I'm going to go with
the no just because it is more cool
toned they palette is really pretty this
eye liner I did really like on one eye
but then when I tried to go to the other
to apply it it just wasn't as pigmented
and starting to get hard to work with
the Sultans and everything is really
nice but I don't know I don't know if
you can get eyeshadow on it and then it
just kind of ruins it or what's going on
but I'm going to try it again in my
opinion liquid liner should go over
eyeshadow really easily and should not
be bothered by the eyeshadow because
that's what it's there for you not to go
over stuff like that so I'm not
impressed with this I'm going to try it
out one more time the next thing is the
concealer I did really like the
concealer I'm going to continue to use
it I like the color for when I'm
self-tan this is in the shade tiptoe
over the line or they just like this it
is a medium coverage concealer but it
does look really beautiful on the skin
doesn't accentuate any texture any poor
going into the eyebrow products I love
this I'm going to continue to use it I
love the shade this is the shade vantage
point is the bronzer which is in the
shade son of a beef I really like this I
love the color it blended out so well
like that nice ashy tone I mean I have a
little bit of warmth to it but it
definitely is more actually if you're
like for me this is the perfect color to
contour with it's just gorgeous yeah and
this is instead of a B I love it and
love the formula I think it's great same
goes for the blush the blush is in the
shade sweet revenge I love this just for
a little wash of color on the cheeks
nothing too crazy and then we have the
highlighter which is in a glimmer of BS
I did not really like this color is
pretty but it blends away when you're
just trying to blend your highlight
together this just isn't my favorite and
then the last thing is the plumping lip
gloss again this is in the shade a
poisonous pouch I love that it's not a
painful lip gloss it just feels really
cooling on the lips and I like the way
that it makes my lips look what I say
it's plumping or no I wouldn't say it's
plumping it at all but it is really
cooling if you like the fact that this
is something I could wear everyday and
it's not going to hurt my lips you know
so I hope you guys enjoyed this thank
you so much for watching and I will see
you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
