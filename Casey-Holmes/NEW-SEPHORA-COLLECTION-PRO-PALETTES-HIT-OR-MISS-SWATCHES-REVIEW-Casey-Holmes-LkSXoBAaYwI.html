to be sharing it with you my review on
the new Sephora Pro palette I do have
all three and I have tested them out and
tested all the one out because I haven't
really dabbled into the other one but
we'll get into at the moment actually
showed you guys on snapchat that I got
these palettes and I had a lot of
requests for a review so I'm here to
give you a review and some swatches and
i'ma let you know my thoughts so if
you're interested definitely keep
watching also before you leave don't
forget to hit the subscribe button and
let me know down below in the comments
what you would like to see next also let
me know if you've tried these out what
are your thoughts
do you love them view Hatem arguing
between delicious go ahead and get
started okay so like I said I got all
three palettes about the warm palette I
got the editorial palette which is like
the crazy colors one and I also got the
cool palette so let's start with my
favorite symbolism figure guess what it
is
the warm palette now I did use this warm
palette when I was in LA and I love
these palettes retail for $68 and there
are 28 shades in the palette you got be
the for website there's a hundred
reviews and they're almost 5 stars which
i think is crazy now I don't know it
gives these 5 stars but let me tell you
my favorite is definitely the warm when
it comes to the shimmers and the maps I
will say all of the maps and all of
these palettes are beautiful I love
working with them I think they've
learned so well that right there makes
me give it like four and a half stars
but when I look at these palettes I
really gravitate towards the shimmer
shades now when I have used it before I
have used this shade which is very
pigmented as you can see I've also used
this one on my lid I've used these
without glitter blue and they are very
pigmented and they stay all day but then
you go on to dry initiate right here and
you go to put it on your eyes and it's
just it's just not there it's very sheer
you're going to see the difference I
swatch the exact same so you can see
right there the pigmentation is just not
the same and the swatches you'll see
where there's like blank spaces on my
arm and that's where the swatches just
did not work out they're yours are too
crumbly to dry
and they're just not wanting to get on
the brush or your finger like I just
showed you guys trying to get this on my
finger it's a freaking hot mess I did
try to use this one all over my lid I
even tried to put glitter glue on top
and it just didn't work so there's a
couple of does in these pallets but for
the most part it isn't all-around really
great pallets I know a lot of people are
comparing this one to be Natasha denote
a sunset one and I need idiom or shade
for your money
but I feel like the Natasha dunno one is
still not so important I don't know I
just really loved her I think she's
gorgeous but I will say I like the
yellow in this one a little bit more
I'll know if you guys can tell on camera
but this one is like more of a bright
yellow this is more of a mustard yellow
I definitely prefer this one I think
it's just a little bit more warm and a
little bit more wearable than this
bright yellow it's just a tad bit darker
the thing I noticed though about Natasha
Jonah's Palace is that is very
consistent her shimmer shades are
beautiful her matches are beautiful you
guys know I'm obsessed they will say if
you want to save some money this is a
great alternative to the Natasha
genotype hallux because it has a lot
more shades and the mats are beautiful
there's just a couple duds in here but I
think you know we can go over that right
there I mean if there's like two or
three shades in here that aren't working
you're still going to get more shades in
this palette that do work than you do
the Natasha nother one but don't think
I'm not going to Tasha banana because I
think the shadows are amazing but not
all of us women spend over $100 on an
eyeshadow palette this is a beautiful
palette as you can see in the swatches
they swatch amazing the max just are
something else
they blend stuff so well it will say
these palettes the Sephora Pro palette
our Head v they're heavier than my note
options another one when I made the
order for these palettes the box was so
heavy I was like what the hell is going
on here I don't know why the palettes
are so heavy but they definitely are so
I wouldn't say they're necessarily
travel friendly but they do have a
really big mirror so I love that you can
just set it up when you're doing your
makeup like in a hotel room or something
or on your vanity I think that's really
nice the next one is one I'm also very
excited to play with I just need to
figure out what kind of look I want to
do it
but I love this palette a lot I think it
is stunning this is the editorial
palette if I can go over again and
repurchase these I would just purchase
these two palettes because I think
they're amazing so again this is the
editorial palette the same kind of
packaging also I don't know what
happened to the warm palette sleeve but
they do come with these clear plastic
covers that have a names on them but
they're not attached like being etosha
Janata won they're just free which is
why I have no idea when one one is so is
probably like you know anyways this is
the electric palette I I don't know in
that one I love the colors in this
palette I think it's so fun I think it
is so bold these neon shades
play no game I thought the Queen's of
the neon shades were over the K but I
don't know these I mean they come off as
pigmented as they look and I just I
can't get over how gorgeous they are I
love this color I feel like I haven't
seen a color like this in a palette that
is this pigmented and this intense in a
very long time same with this blue but I
love these orange shades right here this
red tone this hot pink is whoa intense
bammel things I'm not thrilled with this
front row I think this front row could
have been better especially this shade
it's just so dry choppy and it's just
not good you see how that like blends
out but like this one right here
stunning this one study so we'll see
you're going to have some duds in there
but for the most part they are really
pretty and then this orange to you guys
this copper color is everything if
you're going to get for these three rows
right here I would say go for it it's
cream shade right here is really nice
and pigmented which I love you can see
how light that is
but just these other shades I'm just not
I'm not impressed with I just feel like
these shades could be a little bit
better than not necessarily my favorite
and come off pretty light on my eyes so
I don't necessarily like putting them on
my eyes especially if you can't really
tell the color but like I said I am a
more in love with and pretty much these
two rows I think these two rows are
makes the palette worth buying and then
the last one is one that I tried working
with I will be the first to tell you I'm
not the biggest fan of cool
I shadow or anything like that I can do
cool toned blushes but I don't gravitate
towards them I just I'm not the biggest
and really cold tones are hits and
misses for a lot of people you're either
really love them or you hate them you
know what I mean is what the pout looks
like I have tried to work with this a
few times and I just can't get a look
that I really love because they kind of
look beat up too but they are again a
couple dozen here I feel like if you do
like more muted cold tones you would
like this because it's very subtle it's
nothing too intense these are more of
like basic shadows in my opinion I do
think they're pretty it's like these
gorgeous blue Gray's right here you have
these really pretty like muted pinks and
then you have some shimmer shades in
here this one has to be the biggest dud
in this palette very crumbly I mean you
won't get anything on your finger no
matter how hard you dig in this color
you get nothing you get nothing so that
has to be the most disappointing one
because this is actually it looks like a
gorgeous like champagne sparkly shade
but it's not it's definitely not so
that's a little fat and this one is just
really not that great either it's very
sheer one of the things you're really
going to have to build up but I mean the
masks are just incredible I don't I
don't know what they put in these matte
shades but they are absolutely stunning
again I still really love the matte
shades but like I said if I could go
back and do it over I would pass on this
palette I really just got it to do it as
a review for you guys but again I really
feel like shadows are personal
preference like I don't want to hear and
tell you like don't buy it you know it's
a cool toned palette don't buy it
because that's just me personally I just
don't like cool tones if you like cool
tones you really might like this I would
suggest going in store feeling and
watching it seeing what colors aren't
going to work for you and seeing if
that's going to be a final note for you
because sometimes if there's a couple
shades in here that you're obsessed with
and they don't work the way the rest of
them work is kind of like make-or-break
for the palate you know what I'm saying
because $68 is still part of in a month
so again these pellets are horrible the
masks are really nice from what I've
experienced and using them on my eyes
but it just depends on what you want and
what shadows you're looking forward to
the most and that they don't perform as
well I think that should be like a make
or break for you personally disappointed
in this one again it's the same ordeal
they did have a sleeve in here but I
lost it as well but yeah that is pretty
much my review on these I think they are
great 68 is pretty expensive for a
pallet you have to do the math for 28
shadows it's really not that bad at all
if you count each individual one even
though there are a few shades in here
that just didn't work for me I still
feel like there's a lot better than a
lot of high-end shadows that I have
tried a lot of them so I still recommend
checking them out I don't know are they
going to hopefully they have these two
swords they should they should have
these in stores I recommend going up
touching them feeling them looking at
them I mean they're pretty stunning like
I said with these shimmer shades I did
not use a glitter glue I didn't use mac
fix+
I just put it directly on my lid and
they look gorgeous the ones that have
the nice kind of Sheen like the glittery
sheen works beautifully if they have
like the chunky glitter in them they
tend to not work that well okay so that
is it for this video let me know down in
the comments if you're going to purchase
these pallets or not I try to give
things the benefit of the doubt unless
they're like really really bad and then
I'm like you shouldn't buy it at all
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you all in my next video bye Oh
we barely started but every time people
