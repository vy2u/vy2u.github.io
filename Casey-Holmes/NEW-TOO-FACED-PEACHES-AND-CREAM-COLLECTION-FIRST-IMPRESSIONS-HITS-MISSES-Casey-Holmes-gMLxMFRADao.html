today we are going to be doing a first
impressions on the new two-faced peaches
and cream collection this thing is huge
I was kind of hoping this is like a real
a mini-fridge like not gonna lie cuz how
cute is this it is so adorable
but it's not but that's okay that's okay
we just have to recycle this is super
cute it's exclusive to Sephora they have
like this little like resting this on my
boob they have this little shopping list
that says peaches and cream shopping
list has the products in there I asked
you guys on Twitter if you wanted a
first impressions or review and a lot of
you said a first impressions but to
update you on if I like them or not so
that is what I'm gonna do for you guys
today I tend to know if I like something
or not pretty quickly so we will see if
you want to see me review these products
and try them out for the first time on
camera then definitely keep watching
don't forget to give it a thumbs up if
you like it and also subscribe before
you leave and let's just go ahead and
get started you just open it up and it's
like a vault of all the peaches and
cream peaches and cream have a ton of
things in here to go through we're just
gonna close this and look at it so the
first thing I took out is this just
peachy Maps eyeshadow palette this is
what we're gonna work with first today
again all of these launched on 8 31 2017
so they are already live it says these
are all new shades in the palette and it
smells like peaches so we will try out
the eyeshadow first will say what did
they come out with that was peaches they
came out with like lippies or something
and I despised the peach smell so I'm
really hoping that doesn't happen to me
today I don't know what it was I just I
couldn't take that artificial peach
smell any longer I had to like quit
using it but I'm excited to try this out
I'm hoping that like the foundation
doesn't smell like peach same with a
primer and stuff like that just because
don't really like the smell I'm not the
biggest fan not know why this palette is
so pretty you can see it has that ombre
from peach to white and I just don't
know I love the peachy things from
Georgia the Peach State so obviously
then inside you have a really big mirror
then you have all your matte shades
right here that are really really
beautiful these are very basic shades
not like basic but I mean these kind of
shades you probably have in multiple
different palettes but they put them all
into one palette so you create a full
look I like that they have pretty much
everything you need transition shades
deeper shades fun colors not too crazy
though this is like one of those
everyday kind of palettes where knees
peach butter which is this one right
here I'm gonna use this just to set the
lid and all that primer seems to be
really nice and pigmented oh it looks
really nice I can smell a hint of
peaches but it's not bad at all actually
I'm using you guys this one so that's
that color it does smelly peaches but
it's a very faint smell and I don't I
mean I still feel like it's like an
artificial smell I mean obviously
because it's in makeup but it's not as
strong as those lip products or this is
like way better I can handle this scent
okay so now I'm going to take a shade
peach tea right here and throw this into
my crease
like everything's blending really well
nothing's choppy everything's really
nice and smooth gonna take a different
blending brush I'm gonna go on with
peach punch this one right here looks
really really pretty and vibrant and I'm
going to throw this into the crease wow
that's super pretty very very vibrant so
put that a little bit below the
transition shade I really like this
color it's one of those shades that's
vibrant but you don't have to constantly
dip in and it seems to be blending
really well
now I'm gonna go in with peach sangria
which is this one right here
and I'm gonna put this in the outer V
that same brush I'm gonna take it a
little bit into the center of the lid as
well but not going far just kind of
pumping it right here not rubbing it I'm
blending it right there okay so I'm
actually gonna use peach sangria which
is what we're just using the outer V all
over the lid the other shade I was gonna
use in the inner part looks to be a
little too dark so I'm gonna use that in
the outer V put that all over the lid
just any area you haven't put it yet
then I'm going to use another blending
brush that's clean and use the shade
just ripe right here this is the one I
was going to use in the inner part of
the eye it just looks a little too dark
so I'm going to use this in the outer V
watch it not even make a difference yeah
I was a little bit definition in there
so I'm just gonna stop there I think it
is pretty this is what it looks like I
feel like it's just a really blown out
purple peach look which isn't bad I like
it a lot
the colors were easy to work with think
if you're really a big fan of peachy
warm colors or even some purples you
would really like this palette because
it's not hard to work with at all I feel
like it all blends really well if you
already have something like this in your
collection it's not necessary
in my opinion whoa I thought they just
gave three shades of the foundation but
there's more underneath I think this is
the first one I was like oh because I
thought they picked like one shape from
each to give that's why I couldn't pull
the other one out so I'll finish off my
eyes here in a little bit but I really
want to move on to face now I'm self tan
the other day so we're gonna see what
color matches perfectly but first I'm
gonna go in with the primed and peachy
cooling matte skin perfecting primer
says it's a 16 hour long wear 12 hours
shine control I've got a lot to live up
to there just comes like this it looks
the same as the foundation just a little
bit smaller and a little bit different
on the front but you know has a pump see
what it looks like
oh it's peach color oh it is cooling the
moment it hit my finger it felt cooling
this smells like oranges to me Oh know
why but give it me vodka orange vibes
okay so that is mattifying
it feels good now I'm going to use this
peach perfect comfort mat foundation oil
free 14-hour wear oil controlling and
photo-friendly this is an exclusive
comfort mat formula so the shades I'm
looking at are warm beige and sand I
think I'm gonna be more sand just
I am pretty tan right now I'm gonna try
it with a brush on one side and then a
sponge on the other side because that's
how I like to try out different
foundations oh yeah that might be like
the perfect shade so there's sand like
the perfect match for myself tan it's a
peach smell for sure
feels really nice - it feels like it
just blends so effortless they'll like
it blends so effortless oh my god it
feels like it blends so effortlessly and
honestly with a brush it covered pretty
well that color is pretty pretty dang
spot-on for this soft hand well I want
to see if I can put it up a little bit
more in this area I'm taking just a
little bit I'm gonna kind of press it in
I like it I think it looks good feels
good on the skin has a little glow to it
though so I wonder how this is gonna
last because it does have a little hint
of a glow so I'm gonna take a sponge
which is the l'oreal one that i love and
i'm going to put it on the rest of my
face
I like a brush better for sure
feel like the brush covers more this
gives more of a medium coverage where
this one gets more full so I'm gonna do
cuz you see the difference there
see all this redness is still here this
eye looks way better so on the package
here it says first of its kind and
moulting cream to powder formula comes
in toasted peach I'm gonna go ahead and
tell you because I want to take this off
and it took the label with it so toasted
peach it's a pretty color there just
swatch of it right there I'm just gonna
use a brush contour out my cheeks okay
that's what that looks like I mean it's
pretty
but it is a nice color is it I guess
they only have this one shade which is
kind of kind of sucks I can't say I
would use it all the time but I do think
it's pretty color is really nice it's
like that ashy tone and it blended
really easily as well uh I don't think I
want to use this blush because this is
very vibrant I'm not about this super
vibrant life um oh let's just swatch it
and see
yeah I this is like a hot pink I would
have expected more of a peach color
blush but what do I know
okay so I'm gonna use this little duo
fiber brush from Smashbox and lightly go
in here like scrape off the excess and
I'm just going to put it on my cheeks
I do not like wearing cream blushes it's
just never been a good thing for me
especially when I get oily throughout
the day well this color looks good it's
not as intense if you go in with a light
hand it's really pretty but again I
don't see myself using this this is in
the shade so peachy that's what it looks
like it does look a little bit more
peachy on the skin but I still think
it's like more of a pink okay and then
we have a highlighter that's called
happy face looks like that looks like
it's gonna be more of a golden highlight
that's what it looks like I'm gonna use
this smashbox precise highlighting brush
it's one of my favorite brushes right
now for highlight pretty again I
normally don't use a cream highlight
it's pretty if you like cream products
you'd probably like this it's not as
intense as I like but it is pretty just
adds a nice little glow to the skin so
here's my face with all the cream
products on the highlight is really
pretty the blush worked out really great
as well so did the bronzer I think it's
all gonna be personal preference I don't
think any of these items were like
complete or anything it really just
depends on what kind of makeup you go
for but I do like it I think it looks
really pretty um I actually do like the
highlight I think that highlight was
really gorgeous I love the packaging of
this I think it is so beautiful it is
the mattifying loose setting powder it's
infused again with the peach and sweet
fig cream it looks like it has a little
bit of a tint to it you get a lot of
product in here okay so they do have the
lid they had the lid on the Too Faced
Born This Way one as well so I'll
probably be chopping this off like I did
the last one which I'm gonna go ahead
and do that now so this is what it looks
like by the way that's just personal
preference I don't like these lids I
don't find them to be helpful just for
me I know people like them for traveling
but I also like it when packages come a
like this but if they include a little
puff on top that also helps keep that
powder on the
side but I'm I really don't care if it
gets super messy cuz it's a loose powder
it's gonna get messy anyway testing
there's just one shade of this and we're
gonna go ahead and set the face this is
also in the PR package they said this is
Jared's favorite it's the peach blur
translucent smoothing a finishing powder
I don't know why there's two but this
one has like a peachy tint to it so I'm
gonna hook that up on Sephora since it
is real quick just to see it's an
innovative blurring and finishing powder
for a flawless looking complexion this
translucent peach colored powder
contains again Tamizh this translucent
peach colored powder contains optical
correcting spheres to help smooth the
appearance of lines wrinkle and other
skin perfections
imperfections not perfection says it
blurs imperfections visibly brighten
skin smells like peaches and cream
peaches and cream so I guess we'll just
we'll just do a nice little bake and set
the face with this so I'm gonna use my
favorite toothpaste mr. right brush I
find it's only right
set everything wow that highlights
showing through
I'm liking I just got powder in my mouth
and it has it taste to it not a bad
taste but it tastes good this is setting
very well this looks really beautiful I
didn't put on concealer why didn't you
guys tell me oh my god alright we got a
crisis we've got a crisis here people I
just set my face so good I didn't bake
like what the heck is wrong with me god
I didn't even highlight my nose my
forehead jeez okay I apologize for that
you guys we're gonna be very highlighted
today
oh okay so I'm gonna set my under eye
with this powder hopefully have it all
melt together with everything else okay
so this is what we're looking like I
feel like that powder that I just used
this mattifying loose powder actually
looks really beautiful on the skin it
looks very like smoothing and everything
so I'm wondering why he came out with
this but we'll put a little on you know
we'll just we'll see well I actually
will use this at the end that's what
we'll do I also came out with a new
bronzer this is the sweetie pie radiant
and matte bronzer I have seen pictures
of this online it says you can highlight
bronze and skulls right yeah it says you
can define highlight and sculpt with
this this is what it looks like it has a
shimmer to it interested to see how this
looks on the skin so that's the color
it's pretty light but we'll use this
soho brush we'll mix it all together and
put this on the cheeks oh I don't like
that I don't like that I can see like a
hint of shine coming through oh I don't
know no no no it does have like a peachy
tone to it but I don't I don't like that
at all there's just something about
mixing that bronzer with the peach it's
kind of going on more as a blush I'm
just not feeling that for a bronzer and
sculpting I just don't think that's the
right color for me so this one's gonna
have to be a pass just right off the bat
I don't really like the way that looked
so I'm gonna go ahead and finish up my
face and then we'll come back I'll give
you another little update and we will
put on some
lipsticks from them not just cracked and
then also put a little bit of this on as
like a finishing powder so yeah I will
be right back in just a second
so I put on my brows I use my benefit
products the precisely my brow and goof
proof then I used this essence volume
stylist eight hour mascara eye 18 hour
it's 18 hour mascara and then I also
used my flower Beauty shimmer inch drop
highlighting palette I'm just a topple
over the face that's why I'm so
highlighted use it underneath my brow
bone as well and then I did just use the
shade just ripe with a pencil brush
underneath my lower lash line to smoke
it out and that's all I did
so now we have a few more items to go
through we have three different
lipsticks so there's 20 different shades
of these lipsticks and they are supposed
to be a hydrating matte lip product we
will see we got some pretty shades here
we have Sunday a fun day these packet
this packaging is really cute as well oh
they have the color on the top I didn't
even know what is that everyone needs to
do this this is awesome so opening it up
whoo this is so pretty
here's the lip product has the peaches
on it and as well as the two-faced logo
on the top this one's in the shade a
Sunday Funday
I like this packaging a lot so there's
Sunday Funday probably what I'll wear
today then we also have the shade
drunk-dial which is a pretty purple
there's drunk-dial that's really pretty
we have a nude in the shade Dollface
which is very very pretty
there's the three shades this one is
pretty nude I would use that to like put
in the center of my lips to give like a
highlighted effect and make them look a
little bit plumper I'm gonna go in with
Sunday Funday I think it's really pretty
just put this on my lips ooh this is
pretty light lot lighter than I expected
it's a lot lighter on my lips and I
thought it would be so now like I said
we have two more products left oh
my baby have this setting spray normally
I'm not a setting spray kind of person
I've never seen a difference with
setting sprays so I normally don't
recommend them to you guys because if I
don't see a difference I don't see a
difference but I figured I would try
this out this is a two-faced piece
missed mattifying setting spray and it
says shake well hold away from face
spray directly on to skin how could you
like everything the details with
everything looks really really pretty I
give them that it's a really pretty
collection I will say I look very matte
right now and I'm very impressed with
the foundation and the powders so far
actually before I spray my face down and
lock it in I am gonna use this peach
blurred product where to see if this
makes any difference
okay I don't see a huge difference with
this maybe if I didn't use the loose
powder I would but I don't I don't
really I don't really like this I feel
like if anything it kind of made me look
shiny and weird I don't know I don't I
don't really like it now I'm gonna go
ahead and set my face with this
mattifying setting spray
okay so we've sprayed our face with that
and it's supposed to make us matte so
we'll just wait for that to dry down
it's the only thing like setting sprays
I just cannot stand spraying it on my
face and then seeing like little water
droplets it just drives me nuts I even
tried to like take a sponge and like dab
over it and it just so that is
everything that from the new Too Faced
peaches-and-cream collection I think it
is very cute I really like this
foundation so far it's really awesome I
do like this cooling matte primer I need
to try it out a little bit more primer
is one of those things that you need to
kind of try out with different
foundations and see how well it works
I didn't notice like pore filling or
anything like that I also really liked
this powder this peach perfect
mattifying loose setting powder I think
this is great love the packaging think
it's really pretty I love the 10th of
this as well I'm interested to see how
well this lasts throughout the day about
hit myself in the face and the other
product that I really love is the Just
Peachy mattes eyeshadow palette I think
this is great these are the ones that I
would personally buy I do like the
lipstick but it is a little too nude for
me now they do have more shades but out
of these three colors that I showed you
guys I personally wouldn't have bought
any of them I'm gonna be honest with you
but the formula does seem really nice
I'd say okay since I don't know about
the primary I'm gonna just put this down
but I do like it so far
if I had never tried out this collection
before the things that I would want to
buy are these three products I think
they're the best they impressed me the
most and they are the things that I will
continue to use with the primer I'm
still going to try out with different
things but these three are very nice I
will definitely keep you guys updated on
how the foundation wears and all of that
the things that I would not buy is the
Too Faced sweetie pie radiant matte
bronzer I just did not like the shade of
this I just don't think it's flattering
I just I think maybe if you took the
peachy tones out I would like it a
little bit more because I could really
see
a peach sheen on my face as well as this
peach blur smoothing finishing powder I
just add I don't know not a lot comes
off maybe that's the point of it but I
didn't really see a difference on my
skin I just it's just something that I
don't think you know that's not
something I would buy and then the
products that are definitely gonna be up
to you and what you like with makeup are
the matte lipsticks which these are
super nice I do like the formula again
with these cream to powder things it's
all about what you want for your makeup
I would use these again I think these
are really nice I like the shade of the
contour I think the highlight is so
pretty and I love that it also shows
through when you put a translucent
powder on top the fact that this shows
through just makes it a little bit
easier when you're getting ready if
you're trying to go in a rush put some
powder on top and you're fine because
it'll still show through and give you
that glow it also doesn't add any extra
powder on top you know what I mean so I
really do like both of these I will keep
these products but I will not keep the
blush I'll probably give this to a
friend but that is pretty much it you
guys I hope you enjoyed this video it
was a lot of fun to film let me know you
guys think down below in the comments
have you purchased anything from this
collection are you going to purchase
anything I am interested to hear again I
will keep you guys updated on this
foundation and how it wears as well as
the powder again thank you all so much

my next video bye chip
