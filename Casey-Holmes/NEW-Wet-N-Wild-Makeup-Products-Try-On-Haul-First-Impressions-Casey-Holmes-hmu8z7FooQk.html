video for you I went to Walgreens I hate
this chair I went to Walgreens earlier
to get dry shampoo I didn't get dry
shampoo but I got a lot of makeup I
actually have a whole nother bag here
full of new drugstore stuff that I know
I know this is ridiculous
I know it is but I do for you and I do
it for the reviews and I'm just so
excited about all this stuff that I had
to pick it all up and try it out for you
guys and wet n wild was one that I
noticed I wanted to try a bunch of
different things from because they had
so many interesting new things out for
the new year and I couldn't pass them up
and I figured I would just dedicate a
whole video to all the wet wild products
and do like a live demo first
impressions and just kind of share these
products with you guys so this one is
going to be all about wet and wild and
their new products and then sorry my
sweater here or not my sweater here but
my sweater like the stuff on it is
getting all over buffing let me know in
the comments if you kind of like the
grouping hauls reviews first impressions
demos in the comments below and don't
forget to like this video if you liked
it and yeah let me show you guys some of
the new stuff from Rio first thing is
something I've never seen before it is
the wet and wild brush up a brush
cleansing cloths I've never seen
anything like this basically what it is
is a cloth that you can spot clean your
brushes with and it's 25 pre-moistened
brush wipes it's fast drying easily
dissolves and removes oils and
contaminants so let's smell it first
whoo this one's kind of good I don't
know it on mine I don't know what it
reminds me of but it cut it so good
that's not like really bad so I'm
excited to try this out I'm just going
to go ahead and show you guys all the
products I get at first and then we'll
kind of do like a makeup tutorial first
impression stuff throughout the video so
with these I want to say I was watching
so many drugstore videos and like just
within the past couple days and nobody's
washed these that I saw and I was like
are those creams are those powders I
don't know because they look so perfect
in the pan and it just looks like a
cream to me doesn't it does anybody else
think it looks like a cream their creams
I don't want to try them if they're
powder
a hundred percent want to try them and I
just had to go to Walgreens myself and
figure it out and they are powders if
you are wondering what is the caramel
toffee one this has the yellow tone
powder and then the other bronzer which
is darker and then you have the dulce de
leche which has more of a hazy highlight
and then an a sheer contour shade so I
was super excited about these I can't
wait to try them out today I'm just like
so pumped and then they also had an
illuminating palette this is in catwalk
pink I am so excited about this because
first off it looks beautiful in the pan
but the stripes are so big that you
could just dip your head and brush in
there and use whatever color you want or
you could swirl them together and I
think that is amazing because usually
stripes like this are really small and
you can't just use one you know so I
appreciate that and I can't wait to test
out these colors especially this one
right here
when while also reformulated their
blushes already had the other two so I
didn't feel like it was necessary free
to buy them I don't have this one this
is in rose champagne and it's the color
icon blushes these are like a staple
they have been for years for almost
everybody they're just great and the
packaging is smaller which I appreciate
I did get three brushes from wild bees I
got actually at Walgreens and the first
one is a flat top brush
I can't guarantee if I'm going to use
these today because I have to wash them
and everything but I did get a flat top
brush I'm going to open things up and
just show you guys and then I also got a
small concealer brush and a large shadow
brush the lady said they had just put
these out and they were having a hard
time keeping them in stock and as she
was dying I was like taking each one one
by one now's like oh really I wonder why
that's why cuz people like me to take
like all of them and then the next thing
I'm super pumped about is the wet and
wild uh Velvet Matte lip colors this one
is in charred cherry which is more of a
mob and then this one is in a honey
Hickory what is it and then this one's
in hickory-smoked which is more of a
nude aren't those gorgeous like I I hope
these are great because they look
absolutely beautiful
this one is not going to be a first
impression I have tried it and I will go
ahead and just tell you I do love it
because I think it's so great it's so
lightweight and just feels really great
on the skin and then
webblock instant flawless complexion
highlighting a pin I got the color
posing nude okay and then I also got a
photo focus setting spray I'm kind of
iffy on this packaging but I want to try
it out and see how it works and I kind
of want to look at the ingredients as
well okay and then I got two new
eyeliners I got a thicker one this is a
graphic marker liner you can see the tip
is more dramatic and thick and then I
also got the felt tip eyeliner this
one's the fine one which is a little bit
pointy err and would be great for winged
eyeliner I got two more fives I'm pretty
sure I have this one but I got it just
in case this isn't the one that I have
but I'm pretty sure I've used this I'm
pretty sure this is the wet mop
mattifying powder it's in matte about
you it's just a translucent mattifying
powder I have one just like this it was
from the Fergie collection so if this is
the same one then I love it but I
figured I would pick it up just in case
it was different and that's what that
looks like and then I also got an
eyeshadow palette this is their studio
eyeshadow palette and coming in latte
and these are beautiful I'm hoping these
have the pigmentation like the old
school um six pan eyeshadows from wet
wall work they were amazing I remember I
used to have like three of two different
shades because I loved them and then
they discontinued them and I was just
heartbroken so hopefully these are good
so we're actually gonna try these out
first so after a lot of hard work I
finally got it open
oh and it comes with like a flat brush
and a blending brush where actually I'm
gonna try it out with that but this is
what they all look like I want to
quickly just swatch a couple okay I can
already tell you a couple of the pans or
falling out on if you can see right
there but they're already falling out no
see there press them back in there they
don't want to go back in there
don't try out this gold oh very nice
kind of bronze you shade okay and I'll
see the black ok these are looking
promising the first thing we do I am
going to use this brush because it just
came with it I'm going to take this
shade right here and I'm going to put
that in
to my crease this is a very fluffy brush
which I enjoy like that looks really
good to come with a palette and I'm just
going to blend that like I said in my
crease you can see the difference right
there it's not too intense but you can
build it up and this blending brush is
really soft and you just want to use a
really light hand with it it doesn't
distribute a ton of product but it's not
like absolutely terrible I wouldn't
throw it away Oh keep it in the palette
okay I don't hate it looks good I'm like
I in this color this is my kind of color
this bronze shade right here that it's
watched I'm going to take the flat
shader brush on here I'm just gonna put
that on my lid if you're not a huge fan
of the flat shader brush that's okay I
do find out to pack it on a little more
but I mean it's not terrible
it might honestly even just be the brush
for the reason why I have to pack it on
so much because it is such a dense brush
and it doesn't really pick up that much
product so that's probably another
reason why now I'm going to take the
darker Brown in the palette which is
right next to it and just deepen it up a
little bit dark brown
I like it I don't hate it I'm going to
clean this up don't worry what happens
when I don't put tape on I just get
crazy okay so all in all I really do
like this little palette I think they
blend very well I think the flat brush
in here could be a little bit better it
kind of takes away from the color you
can see on my lid you can't really see
the bronze shade very well but the
darker Brown went on really well and so
did the crease color with this little
brush but if you're in a pinch and you
need a brush I think this will be fine
and I really do like these shadows in
here also have a cool tone one with more
purples and blues and I don't know what
that one's called but I knew I would use
this one more so I would definitely
check this one out okay so we're going
to try out these two liners I want to
try out the sick one first it's in
jetliner black and again this one is the
graphic marker eyeliner you see how this
one applies um on my eyes chubby so it's
a really chubby stick super super thick
Wow that's one loose what that was like
look Oh as a marker this is not
eyeliners a marker so I'm going to apply
this and see how it applies the only
thing I could cover off of that is I
wish this kind of like went on like a
marker you know like the top to be on
but it's not a deal breaker
okay so that is that one right there
only thing is I know I messed up a
little bit more with it because it
doesn't glide across the eye as easily
just because it is such a thick one but
this eyeliner is so black and nice like
I I don't mind it at all I would have to
clamp the outer liner just to make it
look more sharp and crisp but I think
with more practice I would be able to do
a winged liner and like a heartbeat
because you can just take it place it
get the little wing and then scoop it up
and you'll be fine
so I like this I think this one is a win
so far so let's try out this other one
this is again the fine tip one so
hopefully it has like the same formula
because this stuff is frickin intense
and this one is in black noir and this
one does have a smaller packaging this
is definitely more travel friendly and
let's see you
I like that felt tip right there oh yeah
just as black I'm excited I'm really
good okay let's do it
I love this one the main reason why I
love this one
more than the thick kind of marker one
is because the felt tip gives a little
bit more so it's easier to work with I
do worry if the felt tip is going to
kind of dull out a little bit over time
because I noticed it started to kind of
like shape a little bit differently at
the tip when I was working with it but I
I love this one this one's definitely my
favorite and so if you do wings liner or
you want something that's really easy to
glide across your eye I would pick up
the smaller one if you want to get more
wild and practice your winged liner and
make it really easy I would do this okay
so now I've got a foundation on which I
know it's too light this is a new
foundation and I'm trying to find my
shades oh that's okay because we can use
bronzer to warm up the skin but I wanted
to show you guys the new concealer that
wet mob has and it's the highlighting
and concealing pin again I am in posing
nude I really do like this stuff I think
it's great I think it's totally worth
the money
I love the twist up I think it's great
for travel so I'm going to twist it up a
little bit and I'm going to put this
underneath my eyes like I normally would
it is a little messy but it's really not
terrible and then I'm just going to
blend out with my same foundation brush
and it's just really smooth and it looks
really great on the skin like I I really
really am enjoying this concealer and it
hasn't broke me out and it looks
beautiful on date night so I just like
look at it it looks so pretty I just
can't say enough good things about it
okay so now we're going to play with
these bad boys we're going to set our
concealer I'm going to use the wet and
wild caramel toffee one first and we're
gonna see how this works I'm really
excited I'm hoping this is like as good
as I think it's going to be I don't know
if I use the contour shade I might use
the other one for the contour shade just
because it's lighter and it looks a
little bit ash shihr' but I wanted to
use yellow powder in this so bad the
banana and then this contour product
this contour power is more or
let's look at this one real quick and
see if this one's more ashy or orange
because in the pan it looks definitely a
lot more ash shihr' this one's more ashy
and then this is like a light beige
color so I might use this one the
contour and then the yellow to highlight
so let's go back into this one and take
a brush I'm just going to take my
regular brush and set my concealer so
really fine powder from what I can tell
and it mattifies the skin which I like
because I usually put this in the center
obviously to set all the concealer and
just mattify the face so yeah I like
that powder I have no bad things today
but it doesn't look cakey whatsoever
just set everything and the skin so
let's move on to the other palate which
is the dulce de leche and use the
contour one to contour my face
I like it I really I like this more ashy
tone or my skin that is really nice and
it blends out very well to fine it
blends out really well it's a soft
powder looks really good just has a
little bit of Fallout and that's for
both palate um the yellow shade did have
a little bit of Fallout but I mean it's
it's okay it's just like a really
powdery formula but it looks really good
on the skin it doesn't look cakey
whatsoever and that contour shade is
what I love I love this more ashy tone
right here I'm so sorry my foundation
isn't matching my neck but you know it
is alright
I'm excited about this blush so you open
it up and it comes with like a mini
brush but I don't ever use those so I'm
going to take my blush brush oh this
looks so pretty
apply this to my cheeks oh yeah that's
gonna be my new favorite brush or blush
nut brush it does have some shimmer to
it and it's like giving a really pretty
glow but the best part about these is
they blend so well okay now for
highlighter we're going to use this one
again this one is in catwalk pink it'd
be really cool if they came out with
like a more golden one I know they have
some golds in here but like the ones
without pink because I'm not a big pink
highlighter fan I just don't like a lot
of pink highlighters so again that's why
I like the fact that this one has some
thicker stripes throughout okay so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take the
more gold one like it's like a rose gold
and apply that to my face
see that the other one okay these are
pretty I like them they're yeah these
are really pretty okay yep I like them I
like them but you can see right here all
that fall out that's coming out of the
pallet which it is a more affordable
product and honestly I really could care
less but what matters is what's on the
inside and this is a great highlighter
like it is beautiful so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use one of
these Velvet Matte lip pencils and let's
just go ahead and swatch these and if
you guys didn't know what love is
cruelty free and vegan and all of that
stuff which I think it's great so this
one is in hickory-smoked feels really
smooth looks a little sheer but we'll
see when we put it all in there nib see
it's like a good everyday keeping your
first kind of lip color and this one oh
that's pretty
this was in charge cherry so to me I
think they look a little bit different
than their caps um they're a little bit
more bright and I didn't expect that I
expected them to be a little bit darker
but let's go ahead and apply this one
this is more of the nude color I do like
it it's really creamy it is a little
more sheer than I expected it to be but
if you pair it with a lip liner I think
it'll be fine I don't remember if they
have darker colors of these but it feels
really comfortable on the lips the only
thing I will say that it is cling to
your dry patches because I have some dry
patches on my lips right now but if you
exfoliate your lips and moisturize them
you should be fine
I think if you're looking for a cheaper
alternative for a matte lip color these
would be really nice and just like great
for everyday and then I'm going to go
ahead and set my face with this photo
focus setting spray let's spray a couple
before I just spray down nowhere so it
does have a fine mist I'm like so scared
I never use these mmm feels really good
it doesn't have a bad smell at all
and it feels like it's just like dry my
face like my face doesn't feel more oily
which sometimes when I use things like
this I feel like my face is wet
and then after it dries but I like it
and I feel like it gives like a kind of
a dewy glow I feel like I just got a
dewy glow out that I might be wrong if
like I did this one I'm pretty sure I've
tried before and I really like it it's
just a translucent powder that mattifies
you and they had one in the Fergie
collection I really loved it and think
this is the same exact thing but I'm
going to go ahead and try this brush up
brush cleansing cloth so I'm going to
use an eye shadow brush
what's light which one should we use
this is my Mac 217 I'm just going to
figure out where you guys hi brush it on
here so you can see it's taking off the
color I feel like it took it off some of
these brushes are staying from obviously
like the dark colors but it says until
it stops putting off color on the cloth
is when it's clean it's a clean the
brush it's going to have to dry but it
clean the brush that's what gin and it's
not like soaking wet but you can tell
it's gonna have to dry before you use it
so I'm pretty impressed by that I don't
think this is something I would use
every day and just because it's just you
know one of those things I feel like
it's easier just to spray a brush
cleaner on your brush and wipe it on
paper towel but if you're needing
something like right then in there and
just want to quickly clean it I think
this would be great this is awesome this
is really cool okay guys so that is a
holiday product I got from like wow this
is probably such a long video but I want
to try all of them out on camera for you
guys I really hope you enjoyed it I I
love everything honestly I don't really
have anything that I don't like like
everything I tried today I really do
enjoy and I think it just it was great
like killing it went wild you're killing
it I'm so excited I'm so excited so
