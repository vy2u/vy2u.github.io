no mirror makeup challenge and I'm very
nervous about it but I'm excited because
I've been videos for a long time I did
just self tan so if my skin looks a
little crazy that's probably why miss my
side marry you guys see all the time
we're going to toss it on my bed so it's
all the way over there I thought so
don't break it just then and the only
other mayor I have is like right beside
me but I don't look in that so I'll be
looking straight ahead you'll see go get
the hair out of the way and if you're
wondering I'll put my nail polish down
below cuz I just got today and I can't
what it's called I'm going to show you
guys me um closing the viewfinder so can
you see the viewfinder and I'm just
going to flip it over first I'm gonna
take my foundation this is the makeup
forever matte velvet plus and all of my
brushes are so dirty and I've got to
clean them like tonight so excuse that
I'm gonna be using this crown brush
guess it's the buffer brush I don't know
but I am in number 40 in this so this
already feels kind of weird I feel like
face stuff is gonna be fine
I hope this brush blends this out like I
like it my birthday's coming up you guys
yeah hey it's November 25th
I'm so excited I'll be 21 if you're
wondering I know I have a bunch of
people with their birthdays this month
that like our subscribers and stuff and
that follow me on Facebook it's been
super fun happy birthday to everybody
with the birthday of this month
I'm excited okay I'm not looking at the
mirror but I'm reaching for my primer
okay so now that that's on I'm going to
do a concealer this is my amazing
cosmetics amazing concealer this is a
legit heavy duty concealer so if I don't
blend this out properly I'm gonna look
like a crazy person
okay and then I'm taking this Sigma P 88
that I mentioned in my favourites videos
I'm obsessed with oh crap oh god I don't
know how this is gonna work out you guys
cuz this concealer it's one that you
have to look in the mirror you know what
I'm saying
that's why I chose it though I'm trying
to the triangular motion but I don't
think that's working out too well my
lashes but you know I decided this one
cuz I knew I could go back in with this
and buff it out this is the Sigma F 86
this is great for under eyes too
especially if you like put concealer on
like this or something and you want to
blend it out like I'm gonna do now just
like kind of just blend it with this
brush it's so easy and it's pointed so
it gets right underneath your eye
I plan on filling another video after
this so I hope I don't do like too
terrible I'd hate to have to redo all my
makeup okay now I'm taking my makeup
forever loose matte powder or super
matte loose powder I'm going to use the
same brush I just use and I'm going to
dip this in and I'm just going to Pat it
and set underneath my eyes
then I go in with a bigger brush and I'm
just going to set face makeup - I love
this for that so apply it apply it
voyage so now I'm going in oh I missed a
spot self-tanning I'm going in with my Z
palette that says I have a mirror but
going in with my hula benefit bronzer
and my Sigma tapered face for my contour
brush lightly and really really loving
it so just find your hollows and apply
I mean it is everyday you know I don't
see how it's so hard on mirror but it is
I feel like I'm getting in the right
spot though hopefully it's just not too
much taking some more going on my
temples
I feel like I want to try and do more
like contour but I think it's just gonna
be too much I think we'll be okay with
that so then going in with my Mac
palette no mirror I'm gonna take spring
Sheen just going to apply that on my
cheeks
OOP fell put myself in my eye
and the brush is that I'm using if
you're wondering my mr. buddy set so
like my eye brushes and stuff and this
brush and my pot of Russia and the mr.
bunny set saw leave a link down below so
now it's on the eyes I'm going to take
Mac soft ochre that I always take and
apply for primer my favorite primer by
far I tried every decay I tried a ton oh
gosh I just don't like over my face and
this will definitely be my favorite so I
recommend it if you're in the market for
a new primer they were just gonna do
like a brown smokey eye because I'm
wearing this Jean shirt I just feel like
Brown you know what I mean oh this is an
acid-washed shirt by the way
hope I'm not showing too much cleavage
taking then naked palette I'm not
looking at the mirror folded it back I'm
gonna be taking naked first put this in
my crease that wasn't too hard
say that now oh crap I don't feel too
good
going in with virgin as my highlight
how that felt I don't know that felt
right or wrong my angle brush i'm going
in with i'm gonna mix smog and dark
horse going to deepen the outer the oh I
don't know underneath a little bit
okay how we looking
all right gonna take my fluffy brush and
just blend maybe I'll put a little bit
of creep in our corner a little bit and
I'm just going to just a little bit uh
now to be off about my scare crap just a
little bit folks it's not too much
Aunt Polly looks ready okay so I'm just
going to blend you know now I'm gonna
have to reach back and get a mascara
great
I forgot eyeliner - oh god I'm dreading
eyeliner dreading dreading dreading um
top I can usually fill the cover I'll
message this is it haha
and then eyeliners that's the one I want
isn't it so sad I can feel my eyeliners
and stuff and I know where they are
I'm gonna take pencil brush going in
with the same Dark Horse and smog I'm
going to put this underneath my lower
lashes
Oh Lord now I'm going in with my Kat Von
D liner well I'm out my eyes see that
put my finger does it help anything
you
this this is not feeling good I know
what it get did you it feels close to
lashline but I could be completely wrong
you know I'm done I'm done with Luke
aligner cuz I'm nervous
taking the L'Oreal hip liner hate
pulling on my eye but I don't have a
mirror to see anything so don't pull my
eye for eyeliner and so long okay
taking covergirl LashBlast volume it's
like over here
okay fine lashes
Oh that does not feel good I just messed
up oh okay so this is it don't make fun
of me
all right now I'm gonna go get my mirror
oh no way I'm gonna look in the big
mirror oh it doesn't look bad it looks
good from far away I am semi impressed
actually the eye shadow is not bad the
face it's really not that bad
probably just look Sheila here cuz I
have redness going through but it's okay
mascara balm liner not as bad I thought
it would be oh I'm awfully surprised
like when my liner I didn't go all the
way into my inner corner or anything but
it's still not that bad it's not that
bad
