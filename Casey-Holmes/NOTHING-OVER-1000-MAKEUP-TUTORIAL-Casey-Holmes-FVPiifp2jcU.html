today we're doing something a little bit
more bold a little bit more fun
something really great for summer and I
really hope you enjoy watching this I
really like the way that this look
turned out this is a video using only
products that are ten dollars or under
you can get these at your drug stores
like Walmart you can give in the Ulta
drugstore section you get at CVS
Walgreens anything like that there's
nothing that's not drugstore like not at
the drugstore so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video I love creating it it
was so much fun
it's something a little bit different
there were a lot of really great
products in this video honestly there
actually wasn't any misses that I can
think about like I really liked
everything that I use you want to see
how I created this look with all
products $10 or under then let's go
ahead and get started this is the
Maybelline master precise eyeshadow
primer and we're going to use this just
to go ahead and prime Hadi primer is so
important I would say this is like the
best but it works then the first thing
I'm going to take is this la girl I love
mesmerising palette and urban eyes this
is an all matte palette which is great
I'm going to use this cream shade right
here to go ahead and set that primer and
give us some nice even canvas so just
buff it from your lash line to your brow
inner to outer corner just to set it all
okay so and then the next color I'm
going to take is this one right here in
the palette I'm just going to fluff this
into my crease and a little bit above it
I'm being very light headed going in
with this because if you're a little
heavy-handed it can be a little dark so
I'm just being very light with it I love
this palette because it's super
affordable all matte you can't read it
so this is our transition shade I'm just
doing some circular motions back and
forth motions okay so now I have the
L'Oreal single shadows these are I
believe $5.99 SP the first shade I'm
going to use is number 214 just look
like this who I'm gonna know how to
describe that color don't know if this
in my crease just look below that
transition shade
actually pretty I find that you do have
to build these up if you're using like a
blending brush but not bad I'm going to
take a little bit on my lid as well
because it really doesn't matter I feel
like they're just a thicker formula some
examples I can you feel it just like a
creamy thick formula which you're
probably like what the hell but feel it
I'm going to go back in with a first
shade we used and blend out those edges
and while k blending out the edges of
this type of shadow like the l'oreal one
is not easy so you just kinda have to
build up your crease color a little bit
just to make it look like it's fading
because it doesn't necessarily want to
blend really well
give me going into some seafoam greens
today watch it's not even easy for me
okay the next color is telling the star
the show this is a shade 213 sent right
below this one yeah this is right below
that
so from 213 this was real cute this is
so pretty
you see that color let's just take a
moment so I'm going to use a flat shader
brush about staying my finger and we're
going to pack it on to the lid and up
into the crease
that color that color that freaking
color then I'm going to go back into the
first shade we use and mix it a little
bit with the other Shea we use in the
crease some kind of doing a mixture here
and I'm just going to blend that the
edges of it I really love that lid color
it's like it's an intense color but it's
not not too intense and then we're going
to use this product which I just tried
when I try to do a different look and
it's not going up my hand like this
stuff is super pigmented and actually
really nice this is the Maybelline Color
tattoo I Chrome and gilded row and I
need to get some more of this stuff like
I need other colors because it is so
beautiful like why have I not been on
this trend so you've been out for
forever and I've just avoided them so
now I'm going to put this in the center
of the eye going to do like a halo look
to add some dimension in there so pretty
taking it up to the crease and to answer
the on surprise I got Rose kind of color
normally I'm not a pinky kind of girl
now I'm just really amp it up right in
the center there and tap on the edges
take off this tape looks so pretty that
color combo is just giving it to me okay
so now I'm going to add some winged
liner you're going to use the Lottie
London wing woman you guys this was
coming
my favorite line ever how do I was
shaking it you want to shake it so I
thought these were like 14 15 dollars
they're actually only $11.99 so we're
just going to dollar 90 over you guys
I'm sorry but I promise you these lashes
are worth it
they are amazing and gorgeous you meet
them but these are going to be the last
things we apply because we're going to
move on to the face to help this look
come together a little bit more but I
wanted to mention that because I'm
pretty sure you can get them more like
cheaper at Walmart so I highly recommend
going to Walmart first and then if you
can't find them they are they are on
uLTA Beauty website for $11.99 then
pretty sure I got those for like $10 or
less at Walmart you guys logged about it
so next step we're going to go ahead and
prime I'm using the Maybelline master
prime face the studio primer this is the
blur and smooth then I'm going to try a
new foundation today I was going to use
the Maybelline a better skin that you
know I love but I figure out a try I
would try this out it's the main wear
unit dream liquid mousse airbrush finish
I have sandy beige and natural beige so
I think I'm going to go with they want
to go with natural beige it's just a
little bit darker but it looks like a
baked atone so I'm just going to open
this bad boy up you could use the
L'Oreal fund if you wanted to see all
right yeah I'm glad I went with this
shade look at that coverage honestly
Maybelline's doing so well with
foundations I feel like giving me like
so many good ones to enjoy it feels
pretty lightweight on the skin as well I
mean your girls used to light really
full coverage foundations I'll be like
always so lightweight but I mean
Pharrell this is still pretty
lightweight and it's not like streaky or
anything like that
and it's adding a nice glow to the skin
it kinda reminds me of the covergirl
vitalist foundation right now I'm going
to quickly go so I'm going to go so I'm
going to go wet this I'm just going to
go do it on busy you guys I just found
does this I'm going to show you that
like flashing you I just realized my
shirt has like this color on it which is
literally like the same color is this
how cool I'm actually didn't even know
it I just wet my L'Oreal sponge and now
we're going to a comb seal now I want to
try this new concealer that I got from
old side but it looks hella light so I'm
not sure if it's gonna work that had
real really rogova roots really good
reviews so we're going to see this is
under $10 so it's a full coverage a
liquid concealer supposedly it's
waterproof also I ordered so many makeup
items that claim they're waterproof and
I'm going to do a tutorial and they're
going to go dunk our face and water get
in the shower see it's really waterproof
so that's coming soon very excited about
it is kind of expensive but very excited
about it so that's the color we're just
going to roll with it I'm going to do
with this like I do the heart-shaped
tape and the Maybelline fit me so I'm
just going to take this one here a
sticker a big thick not bad not stinging
my eyes or anything then I'm going to
take the Maybelline fit me in the shade
sand lights and by the way I love is
that this is a light cool I just like to
make only one for the rest of my face so
it's not too too light so I always kind
of mix it in you see the two different
colors so I do a more full coverage
concealer on my nose because that's my
problem area I'll normally start to
break up there so I always do like a
super full coverage one that's going to
last here so just going to take my
L'Oreal sponge that you guys know I'm
obsessed with and we're just going to
blend everything else
that's so full coverage is ridiculous
the darker shade in that that and the
fit me is so nice and it's so portable I
mean I'm a torch shape take on a girl
you know I love my tart shaped a but I
love when I find cheaper alternatives to
thumbs up this combo right here stunning
absolutely stunning okay now we're going
to go ahead and set our face I'm going
to use the cokie translucent powder this
is exactly ten dollars just a little
surprised about because you don't get
that much product but it is really great
setting powder so I'm just going to go
ahead and this is my eye so that is the
face set now we're going to move on to
brows and I'm so happy that this brow
pomade is under $10 you know I love it
it's the makeup forever no it's the
makeup revolution brow pomade in the
shade blonde see I use a crap out of it
now I'm going to use this essence make
me brow which is like a little brow
fiber saying kind of like the benefit
brow with it gimme brow kind of like
that just adds little fibers and like
highlights to your brow and it's a
little bit more natural but I just don't
like this route can we just look at this
face this time of day from now on okay
we're going about so now I'm going to
use the alladhi London tan time bronzer
this was in the shade light/medium and
it is pretty dark so just keep that in
mind when you're ordering this and this
is a like red chunk that's a pretty
accurate color right there and this is
more of a red tones bronzer I'm going to
use my Sonia Kashuk brush you need to go
down a little bit there we go yeah she's
just going to lightly dust this where I
want to bronze because this is a very
pick up I'm barely touching my face but
this is a super pigmented bronzer like
we with I'm barely touch my face
take our foundation brush go around
forehead take the MUA
stippling brush and just put in some
more work and we'll be good since the
eyes are pretty dramatic I'm going to go
with a more neutral blush this is the LA
girl just blushing blush in just today
so use this blush by la girl just a
really nice neutral blush liminal and
then for highlight we're going to be
using the LA girls strobe light
shrilling powder this one's in the shade
50 watt of a hair somewhere or windows 7
music okay so this is what it looks like
it's pretty nice every time I do this
David says it looks like I have a milk
mustache and it's so true and then I'm
going to take that same la girl
powder and I'm actually going to
highlight my browbone with it because as
you guys probably know I love to match
my brow bone highlight with my cheek
highlight I feel like it just sinks
together so going on in here okay now
the next step that I'm going to do is
I'm going to go ahead and apply these
lashes and then I'll be back just like
our only product that's a dollar 90
cents over if you go to alter the golden
Walmart much better much better I'm
going to go ahead and fly these these
are the aisle or foaming flashes and
they're in the shade luxe and these are
awesome because they are reusable and I
assume by that they are great they
really do hold up so nicely and these
look like really expensive lashes like I
talked about you so much because I
absolutely love them so I'm going to
quickly apply these and then I will be
okay guys you're back now it's time to
finish up this look I'm going to go
ahead and apply this a.m. to p.m. liner
from a Lodi London on my waterline so
I'm just going to take this
literally the blackest liner ever okay
and then I'm going to be taking this
shade 213 from L'Oreal the one that's
like all over the lids still in the show
and I'm going to put this right down
here please smudge it and then also in
the inner corner I'm really just
focusing this with inner an outer
portion then what we're going to do is
take a smaller brush and I'm going to
use that Maybelline a color tattoo here
in my life there's like lash glue
showing and don't mind that because I go
touch it up so I'm going to take this
I'm going to take the brush get some
product off the wand put this right in
here thank you okay I'm not feeling this
on the middle of lash line so I'm just
going to take my pencil brush again and
go over that then I'm going to take the
strobing powder from la girl and I'm
just going to put that right on top of
that inner corner product then I'm going
to use my L'Oreal lash paradise mascara
and put it on top of those lashes that
is a compromiser for the bottom lash
line
oh it's Maybelline at lip liner in
number 20 nude
so I'm going to use this ellipse entity
Matt lit from jcat beauty in the shade
champagne buzz and then on top I'm going
to use this NYX lip gloss in the shade
natural okay guys so that is the
completed makeup look definitely a
little bit more like colorful and bold
but I really like the way that it turned
out I think all the products are really
great I mean for under ten dollars
I'm sure you found something in here
that you want to try I mean I think
everything worked really really well I'm
very impressed with how this turned out
