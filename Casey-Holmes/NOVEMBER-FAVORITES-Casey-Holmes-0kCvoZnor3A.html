with you my November favorites and I'm
sorry that this is late but if you've
been keeping up with me on my vlog
channel you know I've been a little
crazy this month so I wanted to take
some time to sit down and film this
favorites video for you guys because I
did have a few products I wanted to
share with you and just some things I've
been really loving w do like this video
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to my channel
and if you guys don't know I am doing
vlog cember so I vlog every day until
Christmas I know a ton of people are
doing it this year and I have not missed
a day so so if you want to see the vlogs
that I'm doing I will leave my channel
down below you can kind of see my dogs
and just go along with me for the month
so yeah let's just go ahead and get
started with this video okay the first
things I want to talk about I don't know
if I've talked about these in the
favorites video I'm guessing I probably
have but with the drier months like
actually here and drying my lips out
these have been a lifesaver it's the
glam glow lip treatments so you have the
glam glow scrub so this is the
exfoliating scrub it is amazing
it smells like Doublemint gum and then
you also have the treatment which is
amazing as well this just smelled like
Doublemint gum and it tastes really good
too like you accidentally taste a little
bit tastes really good but I love these
because this does exfoliate all the dead
skin off my list and this keeps my lips
so moisturized
I'll hide at night and then the next
morning my lips are so moisturize so I
love these I definitely recommend them
ok the next thing is kind of different
but I got this in a gift bag at
beautycon when I was leaving and my
first thought and I was like oh it's
called the Brazilian bum bum cream which
I know you're probably like girl what no
it is amazing look at this it smells
like summer to me oh it just smells so
good it smells like tanning lotion a
little bit to me I don't know what it is
but I love it and I love this because it
really moisturizes my skin but it's
great for daytime because it sinks into
the skin very very quickly which I look
for and a moisturizer I need something
to really sink into my skin I'll go for
more heavy moisturizer at night but
today I need something that will just
like absorb and not leave a residue and
this is perfect I love it I'm gonna have
to look up where I can purchase this
after I use it all up because I love
everything about it I even love the
packaging I just think is the cutest
little packaging ever okay so my next
kind of random thing is I want to talk
about scent bird I've seen this all over
YouTube and I'm like fascinated by the
company and I think this subscription
service is literally worth your money
it's just amazing what they do I mean I
don't I'm surprised somebody hasn't come
up with this before they have this
subscription is 1495 a month you get to
pick a perfume and it comes in this huge
bottle this is how many ounces 0.27
fluid ounces y'all this is huge like
this is huge I was showing Davis on the
phone before I started filming this
video and I was like this is amazing and
I'll film about the bad ones but anyways
so basically what it is it's like you're
trying out perfumes before you buy them
which i think is a great idea and
knowing me look at all these perfumes I
will probably never go through all of
these four themes like let's be real I
love this concept I love perfume samples
and I think this is so cute and I love
the packaging of these because you just
twist it up and it has a really nice
spray I know that sounds really weird
but you know how some sprays kind of
come out in clumps and you're like what
the hell and you pay like 70 bucks for
it this does not look watch so good
I just wanted to shout them out because
I think it's a really great brand a
really great concept and you're
basically saving a lot of money
they also have 350 different scents to
choose from which is more than any
department store that I have ever met in
so I think it's awesome you can search
by like your mood and all of that other
kind of stuff but yes 4905 a month to
try out perfumes I just think that's
amazing so definitely check out scent
bird okay moving on I also want to
mention this Clinique dramatically
different moisturizing gel actually have
to face moisturizers I want to share
with you guys but this would really kind
of like knock my socks off I tried this
once before and I was kinda like oh but
then I tried to get and I'm like in love
with this this is so good the other
moisturize I'm going to show you it kind
of gets shiny on my face throughout the
day I don't really mind that honestly
I'll just like dab it away but this did
not get oily on me at all I was matte
throughout the
all day my skin was like really calm and
it was super moisturized it felt so
refreshing on my skin this is a damn
good product so Clank dramatically
different moisturizing gel is great if
you have oily skin and you want
something to really sink in and really
quickly I'm almost actually done with
this one this is the first a beauty skin
rescue the oil-free mattifying gel this
does make you a little bit matte but
like I said when I don't have makeup on
and I go throughout the day
I won't look a little bit oily in my
t-zone but this is great before your
makeup because your makeup application
and everything just goes on really
smooth last skin care product I want to
talk about is this tarte maracuja neck
treatment I think I've talked about this
before if this is the second one that I
purchased and I I forget how much I love
it until I use it again and it just
makes your neck and decollete feel so
smooth I feel like it kind of blurs
imperfections in a way like it looks so
good I highly recommend it especially if
you're like me and you're getting older
that's all of us let's be real but I'm
24 I'm really trying to take care of my
skin and my neck and everything and
we're getting some lines but that's okay
it's life what are you gonna do this is
really awesome at keeping you
moisturized so I highly highly recommend
it for your neck and decollete all right
let's get on to the fun stuff which is
makeup first thing I'm going to talk
about is my newest favorite foundation
that I'm not kidding has just swept me
off my feet it's like we got married
overnight like it's insane it is this
Marc Jacobs foundation I got this when I
was in LA which is like a little over a
week ago I had went shopping and I got
this and I honestly did not have high
expectations for it I knew I wanted a
new foundation because I've been using
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
for a while I still love it don't get me
wrong I love that foundation I might
want to try something new and I saw this
one and I read that it was oil free full
coverage and I was like you know I've
never heard anybody talk about it why
not
but it's the Marc Jacobs remarkable full
coverage foundation I'm in the shade
honey medium I have it on right now
the only con about this is the packaging
I don't understand this concept of
pulling this out and having the
on here like I would much rather have a
pump and it gets a little messy as you
can see but I love it so much that I
will get past the packaging I don't even
care I do not care about the packaging
because I love this product it makes my
skin look so flawless it is so full
coverage you need the tiniest amount and
I'm just I'm floored by it
actually when I wore this that night
that I went out no selfed and I had wore
it all night didn't take it off the next
morning the next day for vlogmas I still
hadn't washed my face you guys all know
this but vlogmas day I think it's 6:00
when I went to the smoothie shop I
hadn't washed my face but my face still
looked good and I was like done I'm done
I love it okay the next thing I wanna
shout out is this Sigma Aurora powder
it's the Korra is the core DeRosa and
this is my Sigma I haven't really dipped
into a lot of Sigma makeup products I
mean they come up with a lot of great
stuff whenever Sigma does come up with
makeup products it kills usually like
it's usually legit stuff it's amazing it
blends really well I used to talk about
other Sigma blushes that came out like I
think last year or the year before
because they were amazing like they're
great products so this is a new favorite
as you can tell I like these kind of
colors I have it on my cheeks right now
it just gives a gorgeous warm coral
shade to your cheeks and I'm telling you
it is so and it is just it's the perfect
powder and this also blends really well
just like the other Sigma blushes that
they had and I love it this is a huge
pan and I just I can't say enough good
things about I used it in my last sultry
holiday makeup tutorial that I just
uploaded so definitely check it out if
you want to see it in action okay the
next thing I want to talk about I don't
know if you could still find this but I
have been using it all month and just
been obsessed with it so I would
probably Google search it if I can find
it I will link it down below I mean you
might find out on eBay I'm not an avid
eBay buyer but you might be able to find
it on there but this is the bare
minerals ready color boost and this is
the bronzer in the beach is waiting this
bronzer you guys gives me life
I feel like I've been to the beach and
I'm actually I have not i bronzed my
whole body with this because I needed a
self-tan but it's like doing it so I
dragged my foundation now and just
bronze my face and I feel like I'm tan
and just I love it so this is what it
looks like you can see by the size of it
I mean I've used this like crazy I use
this all throughout the week I was
working with regal I just absolutely
adore this it's so beautiful it blends
so well it just gives you the perfect
bronze glow this bronzer is the
definition of bronze glow I don't want
to go too deep into it about how much I
love it because I do really love it I'm
gonna expand this like you can't find
this anywhere but they need to relaunch
this next year if they can because I'm
telling you this is the best day ever
okay the next thing that you can get is
this NARS Steven client blush palette I
really like it this is a smaller one I
think you can get this on NARS calm I
know they have the bigger one on Sephora
I'm actually I'm actually like lusting
for that one I'm gonna ask for Christmas
but this is the one that I have and I
really love it my favorite shade is this
one right here and then this one's also
my next favorite and then this one I
don't really play with this one too much
I just it's not my cup of tea but the
other three are really really nice NARS
blush is blend very well they're very
pigmented so once you clearly shout out
by Urban Decay Naked skin I used to not
love this underneath my eyes and now I'm
obsessed with it and just cannot stop
using it I'm gonna need a new one soon I
can just feel it in my bones but I'm in
the shade a medium light and I just
think this is perfect it just blends so
well it doesn't ever look cakey I have
not used my Mac Pro Longwear concealer
all month long all month long so that's
saying something because I love that
concealer and I haven't touched
everything any naked skin definitely
give it a go especially with this Marc
Jacobs foundation it's like a match made
in heaven
and since we were just talking about
those two I just want to quickly mention
this brush it's my favorite foundation
brush it's the makeup geek face buffer
brush it is so good I have not touched
my Beauty Blender or anything at all
like I've tried it in one of my other
videos I think it was the date night
video and that was filmed a while back
and I was disappointed with how the
Beauty Blender applied my makeup I don't
know I think I'm just so used to this
brush and the Beauty Blender works with
different found
it's really well but I just love this
one I just love this one so much for the
Marc Jacobs Foundation and the two-faced
one just buffs everything into the skin
so beautifully and then once I'm done
with foundation and I applied concealer
I will also blend my concealer with this
so it's like a two in one product I
actually have this lip product on now
it's kind of worn off it's the gloss I'm
wearing
it's the Dior gloss in 219 the best
thing about this product is I feel like
out of all the things I've ever
purchased from Dior which is very small
very small product three items this is
the best damn thing I've ever purchased
from them so that's a swatch of it right
there it's a very opaque very glossy but
it has like this cooling sensation so
when you put it on your lips it's like
it feels wet and it's so moisturizing
and I I just love it I love this by
itself I love it over lip products I'm
actually wearing over Urban Decay's 1993
lip liner and then this buxom lip
foundation and bare which I love this
color it's so good the great product to
use if you're feeling like your lips are
really dry or you just want that plump
glossy look and you want to feel really
good this is it and it's not sticky it's
it's perfect it is perfection I
absolutely love it and then what you
guys have all been waiting for
music favorites I don't know if I have a
lot of music favorites but we're gonna
go with it I dunno I've been loving
damaging Justin Beiber last month I feel
like I have been so behind him if I
haven't mentioned Justin Bieber yet then
here it is I have been loving his song
love yourself hello miss she likes
everyone
and I never like to admit that I was
wrong and I've been so caught up in my
job didn't see what's going on oh oh oh
I just absolutely love that song it's so
chill and easy to listen to I mean it's
really really good another thing I've
been loving is Selena Gomez's hands to
myself you keep my hands in hostile I'll
try and keep my hands to myself
they're out here you and also her song
of me and the rhythm I've been loving
that - it's so good
this is called might be by Luke nasty I
just love the beat of this song like
when I'm working out yes okay also I
cannot talk about favorites at all
talking about Bryson tiller sorry not

listening to him constantly this month
