today i am bringing you my November
favorites and I didn't do an October
favorites I'm so sorry the reason I
didn't do it is because time just got
away from me and like before I know it
was mid-november I was like I'll just
wait till November favorites and they'll
share everything with you guys I don't
have a lot of makeup products anyways I
have some skincare I have like a range
of things hope you guys had an amazing
Thanksgiving break
happy Monday and don't forget to
subscribe if you have now subscribed
already I will leave a link down below
in the description box it'll be the
first one that you see make sure you
subscribe because I will be announcing a
huge giveaway on Sunday there will be 16
winners so and let's go ahead and get
started with my hits and my missus
starting off with hits the first thing I
want to talk about is this step in glory
the righteous body butter so the glory
has been sending out PR to me for a
while now and I just got back into it I
used to love this body butter and use it
all the time and then I just wanted to
try new things got away from it didn't
go back to it until recently I've been
using this for the past couple months
and I am so in love with it and once
your skin is so well you can see I'm
using it that's a lot gone I mean which
dries your skin so well it has an
amazing oh it's just the best scent ever
I mean it smells so good but it's not
like overpowering and it doesn't linger
too much throughout the day I mean you
can still smell it throughout the day
and you could smell on your hands and
stuff or wherever you put it but it's
not going to overpower your perfume or
anything like that which is why I really
love that because I can use different
perfumes with it and it still smells
great and it doesn't smell like I got a
crazy mix going on you know what I'm
saying next skincare product I want to
talk about is this right here I think
it's called in role as Leo Laszlo in
role ozlowe I don't know but it's the
cleansing oil for sensitive skin I think
what did I mention this I mentioned this
I think enough Sephora hits and misses
and I wasn't sure about it but now I
realize I absolutely love it I think it
is awesome it takes off all your makeup
you do not break out from it it is just
so good it takes off heavy makeup it
takes off light makeup I can't tell you
if it takes off waterproof mascara
because I don't wear waterproof mascara
but this takes off intense liquid
lipsticks and
thing like that just in a breeze it just
melts it all off and I love that and
it's not heavy whatsoever the pump kind
of sucks because it's not consistent
when you pump it out
but once you get the product on your
hands and you rub it and you put all
over your face it's just awesome and a
little bit does go a long way so I would
definitely check this out if you have
sensitive skin and you notice that your
makeup removers are breaking you out
this would be the way to go so you guys
know I love to be self tan and when it
comes to winter time it's my favorite
time to get self tan bronzed like I'm
just Chan year-round even though I'm not
tan right now because I've been slacking
but I'm gonna do it tonight because I
really want to be self tan for tomorrow
my favorite favorite self tanner is
loving tan is the deluxe bronzing mousse
in ultra dark they also have a self
tanner with a 2-hour developed time and
it is in dark that one's really great as
well I like to put this on at night so I
can wear the eight-hour one and this is
the best you get such a gorgeous bronze
color and I've had people tell me you
look like I came back from the beach and
I'm like oh I wish but that is not the
Beach girl it's this so it looks really
natural I mean people compliment me on
my tan all the time especially when it
gets into the colder months and this is
all I use I love it has a dark color
guard you're gonna see where you put it
I also have a coupon code for a free
gift I think it's a free mint with this
you do get something for free if you use
my code which will be down below if you
want to use it I would totally show you
guys my self tan routine and all that
but I feel like it's just kind of boring
I don't know I'm gonna have like spice
it up or anything maybe I couldn't
include it in the nighttime routine or
something next thing is this little guy
this is like a brand new favorite within
this past week Matt candy yum-yum shade
since and just got all these in the mail
I like them but there are two that I
kept and I'm giving a bunch away in my
giveaway this one's definitely my
favorite has like a candy scent to it
hits candy yum yum oh my gosh you guys
it smells so good this is more of like a
summer scent but I would wear this
year-round just because it smells so
delicious and like oh I just love it
this is a pretty strong scent you only
need like a couple sprays I know some
people go Cheech I have never been one
to do that like I never spray it a lot
of perfume sometimes I'm like how do you
do that how did you just spray
No and it smells good on you and not
overpowering but when I do it I smell
like a walking perfume I don't really
love super sweet scents but I love this
sweet scent there's just something about
it that just smells so good one more
kind of skin thing oh I did a whole
video on the MRI
Carrie Mac collaboration and this is
gorgeous I said it in that video I have
it on my chest right now this is
honestly one of the most beautiful body
glow products that I've ever seen
because the shimmer is just so finely
milled it has that perfect shade to just
kind of bronze up the skin a little bit
give you a golden glow and it looks
amazing year-round I love how fine the
shimmer is it doesn't look like you have
a ton of shimmer just all over your body
just looks glowy and sexy and I think
this is amazing for your chest your
shoulders your legs anything I'm
obsessed with this there's one thing
that you need to get if you love to be
glowy is this product right here because
it is awesome moving on to makeup
products I want to mention to this
primer real quick I don't think I've
mentioned this to guys yet don't think
so but this is a Natasha de Nona prime
and magic primer the anti shine flawless
face Bay is so good this reminds me of
that Nivea skin craze that was going on
for a while where it gets kind of tacky
I didn't personally like the Nivea skin
because I used the sensitive one but it
still irritated my skin pretty bad so I
like this a lot it gives that tacky
feeling to the face so then when you put
your foundation on it just sticks and
lasts all day it does give you a smooth
base to work with even though it is kind
of tacky when it's drying think it's
awesome my foundation lasts forever with
this and it's perfect and the packaging
is so cute too I really like her
products lately she's been killing it
for me next thing I would mention is a
new foundation I've been really loving
you guys know I love a Smashbox to do
skip but I stepped outside the box this
month and tried a new foundation
actually I tried a couple but this one
is my favorite this is the Fiona Styles
matte finish foundation and I bought
this from Ulta and you guys this is so
good if you have texture large pores
oily skin anything like that you are
going to love this product it a number
you're right now cuz I'm not tan enough
which is why I need a self tan because
when I stopped and with this this color
o 5 matches perfectly though I am
hello not tan enough right now to wear
that I've been wearing it so much
especially when I'm taking pictures
because it really smooths out my skin
makes it look airbrushed a medium to
full coverage just more full coverage on
me when I use a Beauty Blender which is
my favorite way to apply it does have a
pump I forget how much it is but it is
worth every penny next up I want to talk
about a few lip products the first two
are drugstore and this one is the
l'oreal infallible paints and this is in
the shade spicy blush I have not seen
this anywhere but I was on Ulta online
and I saw this and I was like what is
that I have it on my lips right now
mixed with a glossy I'm really loving
too but I really like this color a lot
this is just a nice pigmented gloss and
it looks beautiful on the lips look at
that color it is stunning
I love the applicator the applicator is
really nice it just kind of cups your
lip if that makes any sense just gets
into all the curves and everything it's
beautiful and I love the packaging of
this I think it's so cute and it was
really affordable so that's awesome then
for a matte lip color I posted a picture
of me wearing this and I really like
this color this is oh this is the J cat
beauty soft matte lip cooler and I just
really love this color a lot kind of
does take it a little bit longer to dry
but this is my kind of color right there
so beautiful and it lasts for a really
long time and it doesn't dry your lips
out so it is matte but it's not like a
liquid lipstick where it's going to suck
the life out of your lips wear lip gloss
my favorite is actually this side from
the riot carrot collection this is
called Little Miss Monroe and I love the
gold tone of this and I just think it's
beautiful I have it on top of that
L'Oreal lip color right now it has the
perfect amount of warmth and shimmer and
it's just absolutely stunning so that's
it right there this is not the one I had
on in my review video when I had on in
my review video is the dream lover which
is the lightest one but this one is
going to be so great for summer honestly
year-round because I'm wearing it now
and I love it
but for summer and like bronze looks
it's going to be stunning then I have to
shout out my favorite false lashes I've
purchased I think 15 of them this month
because there was a deal going off so
this is the eye
or Lux mink effect lashes and they're
reusable I've used mine multiple times
these are the lashes that I'm wearing
right now they're so full and fluffy
they remind me of velour lashes but
literally half of the price actually a
little more than half of the price so I
love it so much they are beautiful if
you love dramatic full lashes these are
amazing and you're going to love them if
you've tried eyelure and didn't like the
band because it was too stiff this band
is not stiff whatsoever it is so easy to
work with and I highly recommend this
line I'm gonna purchase some more before
I upload this video to make sure I have
enough for backup okay and then last
thing I wanna mention is this brush and
I mentioned this one too so this is the
highlighter brush I've been going to a
lot lately but it says it's for
contouring it's called the pro it's the
pro contour number 79 I like this for
highlighter all I do is I dip it into my
highlighter like that put it on my face
and it puts on the perfect amount of
product so that's what it looks like
it's beautiful I love it has that
tapered in it's just awesome and then
another brush I've been loving is this
Ecotools sheer finished kabuki I've been
loving this to dust the bake away blend
everything out and so soft and pretty
and I like the handle a lot as well so
you can get this at any drugstore it's
awesome last thing I want to mention you
guys know I love these extensions but I
just went shorter and I love the fact
that I have these extensions to go
longer I use the shade honey spice ombre
and I love it I'm going to show you in
like a get ready with me how I style my
extensions and my shorter hair it's
actually pretty easy I've been loving
these extensions again you guys have
seen them a lot on my Instagram and my
blog because I just love wearing them in
pictures it gives an outfit a different
vibe makes me have a different vibe and
I just love them and they look like my
hairy hombre goes perfectly with my
ombre and the blonde matches my blonde
just amazingly I do have a coupon for
foxy luxe as well if you want some cash
off you can ask for it for christmas
worked with foxy locks for over a year
I've used them for over a year I would
never recommend something I did not like
them so these are my favorite extensions
ever I've had a lot of people try to
convert me to different hair extensions
but nothing compares to the foxy locks
they are my favorite so now guys let's
on to the missus and the first one this
is like an in-between a hit in a Miss I
just oh I don't like it but I don't
despise it you know what I'm saying it
could work for somebody this is the
laura mercier silk cream oil-free photo
edition foundation I've tried the
original silk cream foundation didn't
like it and then I saw this one and I
was like ooh that looks different let's
try it out
I showed this on snapchat as well it has
amazing amazing coverage and I applied
it with a brush that was my favorite way
to apply it just because it really
blended into the skin and I didn't have
to use a lot of product and by the way
I'm in the shade sand beige when I'm
self tan but this like it looked so good
for probably the first three or four
hours but then literally you guys at
probably about hours six or seven it
just looked so cakey and I started
getting really oily and it just didn't
look that good so I like this more for
short amount of times not necessarily
long amount of times but when I wear
foundations and when I have our makeup
and I do a full glam look I'm gonna need
that thing to look good all day long cuz
I'm gonna take it off in just three
hours you know what I mean
so this is kind of like a for me what
was that something that I wouldn't
necessarily recommend if you have oily
skin a lot of texture because it will
emphasize it after a few hours I know so
many people love this primer I know
everybody loves this but it just doesn't
work for my oily skin it does make your
skin super smooth and just great for
applying foundation
it doesn't necessarily do anything for
your pores or anything like that and I
did not feel the tightening effect that
everybody else is feeling that I watched
I didn't feel that at all I just felt
that it was really nice and smooth my
god I could not imagine using this in
the summertime because I would be a oily
damn mess oily mess on a cold day I wore
this didn't like it on about an 80
degree weather day I wore this did not
like it I just tried it and it doesn't
work my oils just start to seep through
I start to get even more glowy than I
want to be I just need something that's
going to be more on the mattifying side
which this doesn't claim to be
mattifying I totally get that but I'm
just going to put that out there if you
do have oily skin you want to try this
out I would get a sample first before
buying the full thing because it is
expensive but
give you abnormal to dry skin you would
really like this because it is a
beautiful primer but I paid a lot of
money for this thing and it just it
wasn't like a WoW product for me so
that's why it's a Miss now because it's
a shitty product just because just
didn't work for my skin right guys you
know what time is you don't like my
music favorites as always thank you so
much for watching and I will see you in
my next video
but if you love my music favorites we're
about to get down honestly I have not
discovered a lot of new music I'm just
gonna be honest with you but I'm going
to show you some of my favorites because
there are some that I want to share with
you so if you don't follow my Spotify k
CH L 91 I really love trust nobody by
cashmere cat oh my god this has a Selena
Gomez in it it's just so good
you know just nobody me I like it cuz
it's kind of upbeat but kind of toned
down another thing I've been really
loving is black beetles I think
everybody's and loving the song probably
everybody's over it by now but I can
help young living like an OPP secure I
just love the beat of it and I think
it's so fun to dance to so black beetles
by race sure murder wherever the hell
it's called
got it oh another one is love on the
brain by Rihanna did image in this
desolate Karam ever
feeling
