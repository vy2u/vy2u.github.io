today I'm gonna be filming my November
favorites for you guys I have makeup
hair fashion there's a lot of stuff
going on here we've got a lot of stuff
to cover so hope you guys are excited
for this video I did miss October's
because I was super busy in October I
was barely even home we had her ceremony
for our wedding it was just a lot so I'm
here I'm ready to tell you guys my
favorites so if you're not already
subscribed to my channel be sure to
subscribe and hit that notification
button if you want notifications on when
I upload you don't have to but it's a
really big help and to let you know when
I have a new video out so anyways if you
guys can see my hits and misses for the
month of November then let's just go
ahead and get started feeling the dogs
are out of work it's a mother's instinct
Mother's Day girls okay so the first
thing I'm gonna start off with is hair
products I have a new curling wand that
I have just been loving I got this when
Sephora was having their vib sale so I
was really excited because I had this in
my cart and I was like damn that's
expensive but I wanted to hold off till
I could get like a little discount on it
so this is the wrap party wand by Drybar
this does have adjustable heat settings
which I like if you've been watching me
for a while you know I've been using my
new me 32 millimeter one for the longest
time pretty much like since I started my
channel I just love that curling wand it
always happened I love the ways that it
gave me but I just found that it wasn't
getting as hot anymore so I wanted to
invest in a really nice wand so this is
the one that I chose it kinda has a
tapered one it's still pretty big here
at the end but it gets to more like that
thirty two millimeter effect right here
maybe even a little bit bigger but I
love this because it doesn't give tight
curls actually just curled my hair
before this video and let me tell you
this curls at my hair so quickly it
takes in like 12 minutes to do my entire
head I know that's a really specific
number but I timed it and it's like 12
minutes to do my hair I keep my setting
on about 4:30 I don't go all the way up
to 450 because I don't feel like I need
it I do have a lot of hair but my hair
is pretty fine so I don't want to put
too much heat on it the thing I will do
before I put this curling one on
I will spray the way haircare memory
miss is like heat protectant / like
memory mist I don't know I basically use
this for a heat protectant with this
curling wand my hair lasts for days like
I don't have to curl my hair again for
days and I love the effect that it gives
like later on like they'll just fall a
little bit more and give you more of
that Bed Head look which is what I
prefer I don't really like super tight
curls I like mine to be a little bit
messy kind of like this I always brush
through my hair with a brush after I'm
done curling it to kind of loosen
everything up tell it to chill out and I
also late leave my ends out I leave like
at least 2 to 3 inches as you can see
and it just kind of keeps the length but
adds texture at the same time curls last
a long time curls my hair really quickly
gets pretty hot I like this one a lot so
so far so good
another hair product that I love and I
think I'm gonna go back on Sephora and
buy this in the perfume and I'm
definitely gonna get the bigger size of
this because I bought this sample size I
didn't know if I was gonna love the
scent because some people can really
mess up rose you know what I'm saying
like rose scented things I'm a huge
floral person and I love rose scents
this is so good this is the Elizabeth
and James Nirvana rose dry shampoo now
I've had the white version and the black
version like in dry shampoo form and I
knew I loved like the formula because it
lasts on my hair for such a long time
and it really refreshes the hair gives
it a really great scent so if I'm on
like third day hair fourth day hair I
will just spray this all over and be
like Oh freshly clean hair and nobody
will ever know I don't necessarily use
it for the dry shampoo aspect I don't
feel like it soaks up as much oil as my
batiste dry shampoo does but this gives
my hair such a great scent it gives such
great texture as well also you guys soak
in this hair color while you can
cuz it's changing up she's changing up
this week I am gonna miss this hair
color for a little bit but I just need I
need a little change you know what I
mean I need something something to keep
me going with this hair so if you guys
don't know I did a start my own boutique
back in October of this year so
a couple months ago and I quickly want
to say thank you guys so much for all
your support with that booty it is a lot
of work and it is something that it is
constantly you got to keep up with it
and you got to keep up with like the
things behind the scenes that you know
the customers don't see and I really
appreciate it it has been so
overwhelming and crazy and it's been so
much fun
this is a business that I started from
the bottom with nothing and I just built
it myself no investors anything like
that it's just me spending my own
hard-earned money on all these things
and you guys are seriously just amazing
and you've made this boutique grow so
much so far I'm already having to hire
more people to help us out because I
have a few people that have helped me
since the beginning but now I'm like
okay we gotta hire more and hire more
and when you start hiring more people
it's usually a good sign and I'm just
super grateful so thank you guys so much
this dress I'm wearing it doesn't look
like a dress but it's a dress is from my
boutique this was my favorite one we
have this in red and green hopefully
this will be in stock when you guys see
this video because things have been
selling out like crazy lately but if you
want to restock let me know because I
think it's just like the cutest little
swing dress and honestly my clothing
from the boutique obviously because I
get to shop for it it has been my
favorite I don't wear anything else
really other than the boutique clothing
unless it's like my designer stuff I
just loved them so much and if you guys
haven't checked out my boutique I will
leave it down below so I just wanted to
quickly thank you guys so much for
making it so crazy and such an awesome
experience so far and I can't wait to
see where time takes us I know I should
probably get back to the favorites but I
want to quickly say I know a lot of
you're requesting um vlogmas every year
that i do vlogmas i never complete it
and let me tell you i am so busy right
now that i can vlog but i feel like it's
just gonna be so boring and for me if
i'm gonna do vlogmas as well as the
boutique and my main channel something
is gonna have to give so i might not do
vlogs every single day for vlogmas but i
will try my best to do as many as
possible and if i do pretty much
everyday vlogs for vlogmas then the
channels gonna suffer you know what I'm
saying so I just feel like my hands are
in all these different pots and I'm
trying to you know make sure I get
everything done but if there's like a
space in between anything you know why
but definitely subscribe to my vlog
channel and I'll leave it down below if
you're interested in vlogs and lifestyle
stuff that's where I post all my
lifestyle videos and the home decor
hauls things like that go over there
this is like a strictly beauty Channel
and we did just that great for Christmas
follow me oh snap you've seen a lot of
it before I get onto beauty favorites
even though this is not like a lifestyle
channel another favorite of mine my
birthday was actually on Saturday
November 25th if you guys don't know me
very well I'm a huge a burn fan my blood
is orange and blue and we beat Bama on
Saturday I know some of y'all family
fans are like but we beat Bama and I am
so excited and Davis and I are going to
the championship game this Saturday so
so so pumped
okay so the first make up product I want
to talk about that I love so much I've
loved it consistently and I just think
it's one of the best foundation says
come out is the hood of beauty a faux
filter foundation I just mentioned this
in my last video as well this is just so
nice I need full coverage I have a lot
of rosacea right here especially because
it's getting very cold outside my
rosacea is getting even more red and
more irritated because of the cold and
the wind and it's just a hot mess on
this date usually I'm not wearing makeup
but if I am wearing makeup
I do wear this foundation and I love it
I feel like it lasts so well does
accentuate pores doesn't accentuate
texture and it's so full coverage
honestly all you really need is a pump
and my favorite way to apply it is with
a Beauty Blender so I feel like it's
just the easiest way to distribute it it
gets up all the excess products so you
don't get cake face or anything like
that and I'm just really enjoying this I
highly recommend it right now I'm
wearing a fur eat no I'm not wearing
this one I'm wearing latte 300 n like I
said I'm self-tanning right now so it
doesn't really match but once my self
tan develops it'll match a lot better I
love the plastic case it's perfect for
traveling it doesn't crack or get glass
everywhere or anything like that I know
some people don't like it but I
personally love the plastic packaging
and yeah this has been a top favorite I
have been trying out this jouer
essential high coverage cream foundation
I cannot get
my shade and this though you guys I
haven't got a bunch of different samples
from when I checked out with this
product that they had like a little pot
get free samples things I clicked it I
got a bunch of free samples so I'm still
on the hunt for trying to find my
perfect shade but dang the shades I have
are yellow item say I'm talking yellow
so I'm gonna have to return the shades
that I have but let me know your colors
down below are you kind of like the same
tone as me
do you wear 300 in the latte ooh another
good one another good shade match for me
is Barcelona medium for by NARS if
you're kind of my same shade range let
me know which one you like best and then
another one I want to shout out is this
Revlon insta filter foundation I did a
full video on this and it will wear
tests I was traveling that day so you
guys can check that out down below but I
really liked this foundation it doesn't
last too well shoot get to like the
eight to ten hour mark it starts to look
a little bit cakey right in this area at
least on me but it is a very lightweight
foundation it has good coverage you do
have to use a lot of product it is
expensive so it's kind of like a
catch-22 I mean it's kind of up to you
if you watch that video you know what I
mean um if you want to buy this or not
because there's pros and there's cons
and they're both coming like right here
but so far I've been liking it I did
purchase it and I have been using it and
I think it's a really good foundation
okay next up I want to talk about blush
kits blush kits are my thing these two
are very similar again I mentioned these
in my last video but they're just so
good if you want to save some cash I
would go with this two for one so this
is the ISA for winter blush palette it
does have a mirror I have these two
mixed on my cheeks right now they're
just the perfect everyday colors I have
dipped my brush into the shimmer shades
with the mattes when I mix them together
but I don't find that it's too shimmery
or anything like that doesn't accentuate
your texture or pores and I like it a
lot these two books together are my kind
of shades I would totally use this one
but this one I don't really like pink
shades like this great palette has a lot
of pigment and blends out really well
and then I love this anasazi of blush
kit this is so good this is kinda like
the same thing as this a for winter
flush palette but I love this packaging
I think it is so pretty very stud
it's a little bit bigger than the so for
one it's pretty thick but again you do
have a mirror and then you have four
shades right here again I don't use that
Shea but I love these tones right here I
just think they're super pretty and I
love this palette they are super
pigmented going with a light hand you'll
be very pleased if you purchase this
palette okay so I don't know if I'd
mentioned this to you guys but I really
love this contour palette and I use it
every now and then like every time I go
into my contour drawer like for high-end
stuff I reach for this palette because I
think it's great so this is the pur
cosmetics contour Diaries it has like a
marble effect right here with rose gold
accents and then you open it up and you
have a mirror and then you have three
contour shades three highlight shades I
love this banana shade to set underneath
my eyes or clean up my contour and then
this one is my favorite to contour
underneath my cheeks with it is in the
shade secret and then passion right here
is a little bit more warm which is great
for me to just bronze up the skin but I
really like this palette I won't lie I
don't use this one this one or this one
but these three right here are really
great they blend out really well it's
great for traveling also use them as
eyeshadow I just think they're nice and
it's really cute packaging as well for
drugstore this is no surprise because
I've talked about this I feel like all
month in my videos this is the NYX three
steps to sculpt face sculpting a palette
not a huge fan of the highlighter it's
just not my favorite it's not very
pigmented in my opinion but I love this
contour shade and I love this highlight
shade this is just a really good yellow
powder just like a banana powder it's a
really really smooth it blends out very
well like it's just it's so nice
same for the contour going with a very
light hand with it because it is very
pigmented but it's a great drugstore
option and I love the packaging of this
I mean it's so simple but that's what I
love about it like I love seeing the
colors on the top that's just what I go
for also real quick for bronzer I have
been loving this number seven caramel
bronzer this is not
super-new well I believe in the makeup
world but to me it is new I've just been
using it more this month and I love it I
love this shade I do have it on my face
right now to bronze up the scan kind of
looks like I just came back from a beach
vacation which I definitely did not been
stuck here in 30-degree weather but this
is really pretty and I love it another
face product but I like have to mention
this one because it's so good ah
Nastasia glow kit this is the highlight
I'm wearing right now something about
this has me dressed taken back and I
love it too so much this is a sugar glow
kit it is so beautiful marshmallow and
starburst on my thing I can't I can't
tell you guys enough how much I love
this palette it's just so good
everything blends really well it's not
super glittery like some of the previous
ones that they've had and they just look
great on my skin so I'm very pleased
with this I just love highlighting what
it makes me feel really glowy and really
into like intense highlighting right now
and this has been my go-to okay so I
think now I'm gonna move on to mrs.
because I have a ton sadly sadly the
first thing I'm going to talk about is
this Urban Decay all nighter waterproof
concealer I'm just not obsessed with
this I love the Tarte shape tape more I
love the packaging a little bit more
just because the one holds a little bit
more product this is good for people who
like a little bit of concealer but I'm
more of like a full coverage lots of
product kind of girl so I have to dip
into this quite a few times to get the
kind of product that I want just feel
like it's way too drying for my under
eyes I just feel like it really
accentuates this texture I have right in
here and right now my under eyes are
pretty dry because of this weather and
this is just not working for me next up
is this product this is the makeup
revolution ultra pro glow - I was really
excited about this because it looks very
pretty but there's just not enough
payoff it's not the best palette ever
it's like a thick consistency it just it
doesn't work on my skin it's kind of
crumbly and it Assizes texture it looks
pretty but it's just it could be better
say that it could be better so have to
pass on this is not my favorite at all
so I had to say the most disappointing
thing this month for me has been
eyeshadow palettes I have purchased so
many dang eyeshadow palettes and I've
just been so disappointing just one
actually I did purchase this one and
I've only used it once so I can't tell
you I absolutely love it you have to
have it because I still need to play
with it but it was really good which is
the anasazi a prism palette I did keep
the packaging because I did a haul for
it after I used it I'm not gonna lie I
was nervous to buy this after the
subculture thing that happened but this
is good
this is a really good palette it will
probably be included in next month's
favorites but I haven't used it enough
to put in this one these palettes okay
so two of them I was really excited
about and I thought were gonna be BA so
the first one is the color pop golden
state of mind palette so I just thought
that this is gonna be metallic like
super super metallic very soft they
swatch okay but they're not what I
thought they would be like looking at
this palette you expect it to be kind of
like a pressed glitter in a way or maybe
even like a pressed pigment but the
payoff that you get from it is just it's
just not good I know that looks like a
good swatch but I'm telling you it's
just some of them are dry like that one
is pretty dry and chalky and I just was
so not impressed like look at this one
you see how it's like chalking and weird
I'm just super disappointed in it which
I'm really excited for the brand to be
at Sephora I think it's amazing for an
affordable brand to be in Sephora but
this is not I was just expecting more
from this it's a really great price but
I'm returning it because I'm not happy
with it and it's just not what I
expected this is my first Miss of the
month which is the Golden State of Mind
palette as well as this freakin turlet
the one brand that I love so much
the natasha de Nonna holiday eyeshadow
palette 5 in number 2 airy so in my last
video I shared this with you guys showed
you a few swatches it is just so not
impressive at all this last one right
here is a complete dud clueless
if you could see completely up close you
it's so sheer which is I feel like not
like Natasha to do Nona eyeshadows this
blue is a Natasha to known eyeshadow
like this is absolutely stunning but you
definitely need fix+ to make it as
beautiful as it is the matte shade is
perfection I love it but not worth the
entire 5 pan palette this one is good
it's just not mind-blowing it's
something very average it kind of feels
a little bit dry and chalky and then
this one right here is okay it's not the
best but it's just I don't know other
than the matte shade there's something
about these shimmer shades I'm just so
not impressed with it and I'm really
disappointed because I love this brand I
was really looking forward to playing
with this palette it's just not the same
as like the sunset palette or my green
Brown palette I just don't recommend
purchasing me okay so now we're gonna
move on to music favorites and then we
will be done for this video I know it's
super long I can tell by my timer over
here we've been here for a while okay so
my first favorite of the month has been
pills and automobiles by Chris Brown
just such a good song I love it so much
and I love seeing like the dance videos
on Instagram - that song the one I love
is no-limit by G easy this one it just
puts me in a mood it's good my favorite
part of the song is cardi B she just
cracks I don't know her personality
cracks me up I literally listen to her
part that I'm done it's so funny also
loving thick by Botti Genesis also this
song by Kelsea Ballerini called I hate
love songs it's so good
also I don't know the words this one but
grave by Thomas read
I'm gonna take it
long is so good it gives me chills I
just I love it to so much that is it for
my hits and misses for the month of
November I hope you guys enjoyed it it
was so much fun to film you guys I hope
you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed
