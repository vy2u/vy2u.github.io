my next haul that I got a front pote
look and I asked you guys in a past
video if you're interested in seeing
like swatches and everything of the
things that I got you guys said yes and
if you don't know what hautelook is it's
basically like a flash sale site of
different brands that go on there and
they are on sale like they'll have Urban
Decay laura laura geller nyx they have
just a bunch of different ones so it's a
really great site I'm on there like
every day I have the app on my phone and
I really really love it so when NYX came
on there I kind of went a little crazy
and got some things that I really wanted
and kind of passed up the previous way
to call it sales so I figured I would
show you today because it actually just
came in yesterday so the first set I'm
going to show you and by the way if
you're wondering I spent probably about
$50 and all and all this stuff and most
of these things came in sets and I'll
tell you which sets was was what so the
first one is a lipliner set and this is
the one that I got I mainly wanted it
for this color but because these two I'm
not really gonna use much so you have
this one I've already tried to film this
video once too so I already have
swatches on my hand but this one is
citrus and it is this one right here
it's kind of like an orange color and I
don't really like it at all so I don't
think I'll really be wearing that very
much and the next one is puny Pete PEO
and wise though or puny I don't know but
it's just a little pink liner or lip
liner and that is it right there so if
you love like hot pink lips that would
definitely be the lip liner for you and
then this one I'm actually wearing today
I'm wearing it with my Revlon lip butter
in sure plum and this is the color jewel
and this is my favorite one and that's
what it looks like right there so that
one's jewel I'll tell you right now
they're not waterproof but um they do
stay very very well so next I got a set
of eyeliners and the first one that I
got was grey and I mainly got his
eyeliner set because I want to
experiment more with my liners so
there's the grey one right there as you
could tell all these are really really
pigmented and then it also came with a
lime green one
sure I'm gonna wear this time yet but it
came in it so that's that next it came
with a really pretty brown which this
one is called bronze and that's bronze
right there and then the last one it
came with was a of course a black liner
and by the way these are all retractable
liners the lip liners and eyeliners
they're all retractable so that's really
great and that's a swatch with the black
one so those are all the lip liners and
eyeliners that I got now I got six
blushes that came in sets of three I
don't remember which ones came with
which but I'll just show you all the
blushes so the first one is this one I
already have
and it's been pinched and I love this
color it's so pretty especially for like
the spring and summer
it's gorgeous like I said I already have
it but it's definitely a really
beautiful shade so that's that one so
the next one is peach and this is also a
really pretty kind of pink color I feel
like this is a really great dupe for
pink swoon and it's definitely a lot
more pigmented so that one is peach
right there it's a really really pretty
color I just it reminds me so much
Pink's mode it's insane and then this
one is called summer peach which i think
is gonna be really great for
spring/summer as well I love this color
is so pretty and beautiful and it has a
little bit more glitter to it it's also
really similar to pinch but there's more
glitter in the summer peach or in the
summer peach one so that summer peach
right there and then pinches on top of
it so those are those two the next three
I kind of like more bold blushes and
this one is cinnamon I'm not sure how
I'm gonna wear this one yet but it's
kind of like a bright orange it's really
pretty it's an all matte one and I
really like it but I don't know how I'm
gonna use it yet so that one is cinnamon
so this one I was actually gonna buy
individually a while back but when I saw
it on HauteLook
like yes I want it and this is Desert
Rose and I think this is just the most
beautiful blush color I think it's
perfect for fall it's definitely more of
a darker pink but it is so pretty
so that one right there is desert rose I
love that one it was so so nice and then
this one is called Coco I really like
this one too
it's definitely darker great for a fall
and it's just beautiful it's kind of
like a contour shade so I wouldn't wear
a contour in this cuz it'd be just too
crazy but it's really nice and I know a
way I want to use it as so the last
thing I got was this NYX but naked eye
spy I've been wanting this for a very
long time I've seen so many girls rain
bad so I really love this palette mainly
because it didn't have like lip colors
in it I hate palettes with lip colors
they drive me insane cuz I never use
them and they're just a waste of my time
but this is the butt naked eyes palette
this is such a poor just boots
gorgeous gorgeous palette you have a
huge mirror and those are all the
shadows right there I think these are
gorgeous oh my gosh I cannot wait to use
these then you just pull it down and you
have four blushes a bronzer and two
highlights so of course you know I'm
loving the blushes so that's in the
bottom I cannot wait to try these out
but I cannot get over these shadows
every time I saw somebody talk about
this palette I was like I needed that
palette in my life but I didn't want to
buy it like without it being on hoola
because it's a lot cheaper on HauteLook
than it is just buying it in stores so I
love this palette I can't wait to use it
it's so pretty
