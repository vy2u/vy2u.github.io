looks completely weirded out it's
because I did all of my makeup my face
makeup my lips everything like that
because this video for FIF Friday is
going to be a first impression on the
NYX curved liner if you don't know this
is what it looks like and retails for
$14.99 at Ulta and I do believe on NYX
Cosmetics calm and stuff like that
that's how much it retails for so it's a
pretty expensive eyeliner and I wanted
to try it out because it's just such a
weird shape supposedly it's supposed to
be easier for you if you're like a
beginner beginner or something because
you can just rest your finger on the top
and just kind of do your eyes so we're
going to see today how it works it was
like I said $14.99 and of course there's
other drugstore options that are a lot
cheaper so we're going to see today this
is even worth it purchase did a while
back and I was gonna do a video on it a
while back but I haven't gotten around
to it till now so yeah finally doing it
okay so like I said you're supposed to
basically rest your finger here on the
top and let's see how it goes
pretty black
not super hard to deal with but it feels
really awkward like I feel really
awkward right now
that was harder to work with let's see
and I'm pretty good online or - if you
don't know how you ever use line up for
years I've never seen anything like this
I'm gonna wing mine now
winging out it's pretty easy though but
like that is getting on my nerves I need
a q-tip okay so that's the first eye it
was kind of awkward I go lie it's just
kind of awkward to work with you know
having your finger wrists like this but
it did okay I mean it's a pretty black
liner and something like that completely
sucks so let's do the other eye
and that's that I so like I said I mean
it was pretty easy but let me tell you
there's nothing like super whoo about
this product like nothing that is really
different from any other eyeliner other
than the fact that it has this crazy
little shape there's nothing really
different about it okay so I know it's a
different shape and all but I feel like
you could use this Maybelline master
precise which is deeper than the next
one and they pretty much have the same
exact felt tip I mean literally almost
the same length and everything other
than the Maybelline ones a little bit
longer but they're basically the same
thing and if you want to see this one's
the Maybelline one and then this one is
the next one so I mean they still have
the same color payoff they're the exact
same thing pretty much just different
handles let me know if you have this if
you think it's a lot easier than using a
different liner but I kind of feel like
I don't know I feel like these kind of
liners are really easy because you're
kind of holding it like a pencil and
you're kind of just drawing I don't know
I feel like they're a lot easier and I
mean they're cheaper because this is a
$15 liner I'm gonna do my mascara and I
will be right back
okay so I'm back and I added mascara and
half lashes and if you're wondering I'm
just gonna go ahead and really quickly
show you the master I use this is the
only one I used today it is the
covergirl lash perfection mascara love
this stuff and then for the half lashes
I've been really obsessed with half
lashes I don't know what's going on but
I'm loving the Andrea 301 black accent
lashes these are the bomb and I'm just
obsessed with them I don't know what's
going on with me like I like full lashes
too but I think these just look so much
more natural and better anyways that's
not what this video is on so like I said
I feel like you could totally get
different alternatives for this for a
cheaper price I showed you the
Maybelline for size one which is
basically the same exact thing it just
doesn't have this crazy handle I feel
like this is just the same old eyeliner
just they jacked out the price because
of the shape of it so I don't know I
don't feel like it's really worth all
that
that I personally I'm gonna get ahead of
myself I personally have heard that
these dry out really quickly so I'm
going to continue to use this throughout
the month and it better out dry up on me
because $15 cannot go down the drain I
mean that's a lot of money for a liner
unless you're getting like a high-end
one you know what I'm saying because
then you expect to pay that kind of
money for it like I said I definitely
recommend the Maybelline master precise
pretty much the same felt-tip everything
like that super flexible just like the
next one and it's cheaper can I just say
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
don't forget to like it if you did and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
