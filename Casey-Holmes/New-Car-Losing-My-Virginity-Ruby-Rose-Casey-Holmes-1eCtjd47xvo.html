a Q&amp;amp;A and I've done a lot of makeup
tutorials and reviews and things like
that the past week we could half two
weeks so I figured I would just pop on
here and do a QA I also have to fill in
the favorites video but I want to put
this one up first because I haven't done
a Q&amp;amp;A number a long time and in my stem
and I find them lots of fun so I asked
you guys on Instagram to ask me
questions and we're going to see what
you guys said so my powder up real quick
because I'm a little oily because this
foundation is not working with me I'm
trying out this new um where is it I'm
trying out this new dermablend smooth
liquid camo foundation and this is not
wearing well on my own skin so cuz of
this like thirty months ago and I have
nine hundred comments so cool thank you
guys thank you guys for participating
it's so late at night because it's been
dyno
so we're just gonna load as many
comments as we can and go through them
okay so this is a really personal
question but I think it's a good
question to ask just because it's like a
very curious question and it's really
not something I'm embarrassed about
actually I'm not embarrassed at all that
girl named angelic asked when did you
lose your virginity and I actually lost
it when I was 18 to my first serious
boyfriend which was my ex-fiance to me
that's like a really sentimental thing
so he was my first
and I think this way we were together
for so long honestly Charlotte mlz asked
what Pierre what piercings do you think
are cute / would you get if you had the
guts throughout my life I had my ears
pierced I had two holes in each ear I've
had my cartilage Pierce had my eyebrow
pierced belly button pierced I used to
always want my lip pierced but I never
did I think it just depends if you want
to get a piercing and you think it looks
cute then you go ahead and rock it I
used to love nose piercings on other
girls I never wanted it for myself but I
loved it on other girls because I
thought it was so cute and whenever
people would have like this part of
their ear pierced
I thought that was really cute Islam she
wore she fit I have
idea what your username is but she said
how do you like your Jeep so far I love
you well I love you too and I'm obsessed
with it I have been driving it non-stop
if you guys don't know I did get a new
Jeep and I am so so in love with it I
mean I at first had buyer's remorse
within like the first day of driving it
and then getting my lift and my wheels
and tires and all the stuff I got done
to it I was like no I am so happy that I
did this I'm obsessed with my Jeep and I
will never take it back
miss brain minest do you think Ruby Rose
is hot I do
I don't watch orange is the new black
but obviously she completely blew up
over the Internet she took over you know
how some people make those vines that
are like um like showing how hot people
are I don't know if that makes any sense
but like it's all their sexiest poses
and I like looking at the camera all
sexual yeah she's hot she is really hot
Abbi Benjamin asked what is your number
one tip with boys my number one tip is
to have self-respect
always always always have self-respect
and don't be afraid to say no to any
loser out there that wants you to do
something that you don't want to do have
self-respect that goes for everything
don't let him talk to you in a way
that's like downing you don't let him
pressure you to do anything just have
self-respect and as long as you have
self-respect you will find someone who
respects you and it will be a great
relationship so self-respect kai 28s do
you enjoy living on your own without a
man what are some tips for being happy
while single - something that is
something that has been on my mind
lately as most of you know I've been
single for probably a year now and first
off I love living by myself and without
a man I absolutely I absolutely love it
it's so good now sometimes I wish you
know I had boyfriend go out to eat with
maybe go see a movie with but I would
much rather be along on it then just
have somebody around for that reason and
tips on being happy while single hanging
out with your girlfriends just keep
yourself busy I mean even if you're not
busy just kind of like do things that
make you happy if you like one for
joyrides go for a joyride if you like to
shop a little bit go ahead and shop
nobody's stopping you
ha ha ki makeup ass what country stars
bed would you like your cowboy boots
under ha ha ha you know who I've been
really loving lately as Easton Corbin I
have just been obsessed with him lately
so I'm gonna go with him because I feel
like a lot of you knew I was going to
say kit more but I want to change my
mind
I want to moving on the Easton Corbin
he's hotty toddy
Kelly golden asked what do you think is
the most flattering hairstyle for big
foreheads
I definitely think more of like a side
apart it doesn't have to be necessarily
side swept bangs I don't even think
minor mine are not even bangs anymore
it's just parted to the side I like to
do that just because it covers up some
of the forehead and yeah I just think a
hair style is part of to the side it
looks really nice
nothing like a comb-over but just a
little bit of hair over to the side
looks really nice studio asked after
your breakup with your ex do you still
desire to fall in love again and do you
want any baby Casey's running around by
the way I absolutely adore you well
thank you so much I adore you too that
makes me so happy
um and I do have the desire to fall in
love I feel like it's just so hard
nowadays there's just a level of respect
that I need and that I want and that I
will get that I'm not I just I'm not
settling I guess I just I feel like it's
just so hard to find guys that are kind
of on my level with my mindset but that
live around me it's just so difficult
I'm having a very hard time dating I am
NOT gonna say I would never fall in love
again that would be stupid of me to say
because it's just like that Jana Kramer
song that I showed you guys in my last
favorites video it's called love and it
says I still believe in you I mean you
guys listen to the whole song is
absolutely amazing is the perfect song
and it describes how I feel so I do see
myself falling in love again and any
baby Casey's running around
um well definitely honestly it'd have to
be probably after my thirties I don't
know I don't know I don't know that's
just not something in my book right now
especially since I even have a boyfriend
so no baby Casey's more important asks
any guys in the near future loving
you're my favorite well I love you too
a lot of guy questions in this one I
feel like I have a lot of them lately um
but like I said I'm not even dating
anybody and I don't I don't think
there's gonna be any in the near future
just because uh I've been single for a
year now I can't believe I've been
single for a year the stuff I have done
within a year like the accomplishments
that I have done within the year is just
absolutely mind-blowing probably not new
to your future unless somebody just
comes down the blue which that would be
nice but I highly doubt that
Lauren nicolò 6:06 that Laura Nicole oh
six asks do you have any insecurities
and how do you deal with them I do I
this is actually something I'm
struggling with lately it's hard it's
one of my biggest insecurities is weight
and if I feel like I'm gaining a lot of
weight I start freaking out I don't know
what it is
I actually went Monday and got a
personal trainer and I'm starting
actually tomorrow starting my diet and
everything tomorrow and it's not like
I'm overweight I'm my body fat is 25%
which is not the best but it's normal
for how old I am and my height and
everything but I just need to feel
confident in my body and I just don't
feel there I'm not there yet you know
what I mean my weight is always
something that I struggle with and my
appearance is always something that I
struggle with
so since mine is weight I did go and get
a personal trainer and hopefully within
the next 12 weeks I won't be someone
secure about it any Joycelyn asked how
do you deal with boys who only want sex
that's real easy girl I don't if we you
you know what I'm saying
uh-uh no thank you you can always all do
this Mary you can always always always
tell which guys just want one thing and
which guys one another and honey if they
get mad at you for it
you let them go because there are
millions of guys out there and yes a lot
of them will probably do the same thing
that the last one just did but have that
self-respect say no and tell them to
move on because I guarantee you if
they're just coming to you for that
that's all they're ever going to want
from you
highly doubt though in a relationship
highly highly doubt it
Oh Nats Newman ornate Newman 24s I
honestly don't watch you too but I only
like your channel thank you that makes
me feel good
who ad Malik I'm sorry Jose he's wrong
as dominions are 101 Dalmatians do you
know how hard that is because those are
both some of my top favorite movies ever
but if we had to go on something that
makes me laugh all the time
minions by far I'm like such a minion
freak it makes me laugh no matter what I
don't care how stupid the joke is and
the fact that I can't understand what
they're talking about
I love minions Bron stole asked
house-buying advice so the first piece
of advice is to save as much money as
you can before you buy a house you know
save money for things you're gonna need
I mean the stuff you need when you buy a
house is crazy luckily with my house I
had appliances included and then I had a
watch tower dryer from my old apartment
but if I did not have appliances it
would have been a hell of a price tag
but still say about money because like
not too long ago my stove went out I had
to go get another one so save up money
save up as much as you can put a nice
downpayment down and also when you find
that house when I went house hunting
it would only win one day and I found
this house and I was like this is the
one I want I'm done I don't want to look
anymore this is the house I want let's
get it and if you know that's the house
you want go with your gut feeling and
get that house girl you know you don't
have to everybody keep saying oh well
you need to look at different houses you
need to look at this as this well yeah I
mean there's more houses out there that
you can look at but if you find one
you're obsessed with go for it just go
for it don't care what anyone says
that's what I did and I now have my
dream house and I'm obsessed with it and
it's everything I've wanted so follow
your heart with whatever house you want
and save up a lot of money someone asked
why have you been upset lately
and if you have been following me on
Twitter you would have known
a couple days ago I really had a hard
night I mean I just broke down and I was
supposed to do something really
important and fly out for a really
important thing and I wasn't able to do
this or certain circumstances and I felt
so bad but you know and just your
emotions take over and you physically
cannot do something like you can't move
you can't you just you're just not there
you're not in your body you're not
you're not who you are I was there and I
completely broke down I called my mom
like at 3:00 in the morning hysterically
crying first off my dogs had gotten in a
really big fight Lily just attacked
Daisy for no reason I mean no reason I
even picked Daisy up and Lily was trying
to attack her in my arms which was the
scariest thing I've ever been through in
my life and I I was I've never screamed
so that before and had that kind of dog
fight happened in front of me it was so
scary so that happened and then just
doing things from the beginning you know
I've been feeling really self-conscious
lately I there was like there's
sometimes there's just an empty part of
me that there's just a part of me
sometimes within my days that I get
really really sad and I it's one of
those things that I don't necessarily
what it is but I'm I'm sad at certain
times of the day so I don't know if it's
because I haven't gotten over how some
people have treated me I don't know if
it's because of my old relationship and
just how it might be affecting my future
and what dating and just my future with
anything and my self-confidence no I
feel I just think there's a lot going on
inside of me that I need to kind of work
out and talk talk to somebody but I
can't pinpoint why exactly I was
completely and totally upset the dog
fight was a lot of it but there's a lot
behind all of that that I
I can't pinpoint it I'm just I've been
sad a lot more lately than I usually am
I am not a crier I never cry
I hysterically cry for probably 20 or 30
minutes I don't
I was just had to just had to release
how to release it for my body get all
the cried and tears out and it's just
something I'm working on it's something
that's really really personal if I can
figure it out one day I will probably
let you know but for now it's I can't
pinpoint I can't pinpoint what's making
me so sad so yeah something I need to
work on but that's kind of the gist of
it but is the best advice you have for
girls in their 20s PS you're such an
amazing beautiful woman well thank you
so much my best advice is to do what you
want to do whenever you want to do it
you are young you can do anything you
put your mind to I mean like the 20s and
30s are your prime eventually in your
20s you're really growing into your own
skin and just you know you're finding
who you are you're meeting new people so
enjoy it live your life don't let
anybody stop you from doing anything and
I mean anything if you want to eat that
chocolate cake you eat that chocolate
cake you want to go to the beach
tomorrow you go to the beach tomorrow
you can do it
Kinzie Rae 1995's what is your favorite
Instagram account at the moment my
favorite Instagram account is actually
has a bad one in it so excuse my
language but it's Jerry it is so
funny they post hee hee hoo I think it's
a he I guess it's a he that runs that he
posted funniest pictures I've ever seen
in my life ok I just had to take a minor
break because I had to charge my camera
battery because both of them died on me
there's one question that is being
repeatedly asked like non-stop I keep
seeing it every time I scroll and all I
have to say is if you have to keep
asking the question it's probably what
you think it is so I'm going to say oh
my god somebody asked if you can lock
someone in a room and leave them for
torture who would it be and how would
you want them tortured I can't answer
that that's so bad
scusi Dale asked if you could change one
thing about your personality what would
it be she said I have a short fuse and I
curse too much if I could change one
thing about my personality it would
probably be cursing too much I mean I
wouldn't want to not cuss at all but
it's like a sailor just keeps coming up
coming him I just missed the comment but
someone would ask if I had ever been to
Mexico and I've never been to Mexico but
I really really don't eat that lipstick
I really really want to go so bad I want
to go so bad to Mexico I've never been
so I think it'd be so much fun then last
question of the night is from two league
crews and she said how do you deal with
fake friends the thing that I do and
that I'm really really good at is just
kicking them out of my life
I just don't have the patience for that
kind of stuff and I don't have the
patience for any of it I'm just really
really honest you have to really like
irritate the out of me and really
piss me off over the course of our
friendship I'm not going to be your
friend anymore if I don't like it I
don't want to associate with it I hope
