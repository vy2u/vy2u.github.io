impression on this covergirl bombshell
mascara this is a two-in-one
kind of mascara and basically it's
supposed to give you super volume eyes
lashes which is what I always want
because I have super long lashes as it
is so I look for things that are mainly
going to make my lashes look huge and
voluminous so this does it's all about
the volume so I'm excited to try it out
I can't remove it right here basically I
got the color very black and it says
that the first side right here is to
volumize it says LaVon for unbelievably
big volume second one says intensifies
Salem with one coat for an intense dark
all-day finished I'm excited to try and
sound let you guys know what I think as
I said before in videos with I with
first impressions on my scarab I'm the
kind of person who can definitely tell
right away if they're going to love a
mascara or not so if I don't like it I
don't like it and if I like it I like it
and I've been looking for a nice
drugstore alternative to my yl baby doll
mascara just to use like more on a
day-to-day basis because I absolutely
love my wife sell one it's just super
expensive and sometimes you know you
just need an alternative so I hope this
will give me really big lashes because
from what it looks like it's supposed to
give you huge lashes it doesn't say
anything about lengthening is just
basically all about volume at least
that's what I'm thinking looking at it
the first thing I can tell you is I do
not like the packaging I just don't
think it's necessary to have such a
large - but that's my kind of personal
preference people can be different but
literally like I wouldn't be able to fit
this in my Muji door because it's just
way too big so I'm going to unpackage
this and show you guys what its gonna do
okay so I'm going to take the mascara
out of the packaging and we're just
gonna get started okay so this is the
first side well the one's kind of weird
I don't know if you guys can see that
put the bristles pretty much disappear
at the end but they are pretty large on
this side so that's kind of an odd brush
I don't know how they expect that to
work so that'll be really really
interesting and I've also not curled my
lashes or anything like that okay so
this is just one
application by the way I'm not going to
go in for a second one so far it looks
like this really lengthens I don't think
it creates a ton of on you but it does
look nice I like it so far it's not
clumping it's kind of hard to get right
here in the inner part of my eye because
I want to get those lashes as well but
for the most part it does look pretty
nice okay so that's the first
application with the number one side and
then going on to the second one I don't
really want the mascara to dry just like
a regular kind of wand like the bristle
one nothing too crazy so we're just
going to apply that right over top see
if it gives us some pneumatic lashes
that smells weird they're really curled
up I don't know if you guys can tell but
the first one really did curl the lashes
nicely I'm going to apply another
application of the number two just to
see if it'll add more volume to me this
is not as dramatic as I was expecting it
to be but I mean it does look nice okay
with the second application of the
second side I do really like it this is
a nice kind of everyday mascara I like
more dramatic lashes like all the time
so that is it with a two-step I do
really like it I think it looks nice
they're not really clumpy or anything
like that so this is both of them one
without mascara and one with one on like
I told you guys I do have pretty long
lashes as it is I look for volume mainly
and this does give me a lot of volume
but it's not like super super dramatic
okay so I've got the mascara on both
eyes and also my bottom lashes and I do
like it like I stated earlier I don't
think it's like super oh my gosh
bombshell lashes for me I would go to
this mascara on an everyday basis if I
wanted more dramatic lashes I would
definitely
for my wife's l1 but I have to say I do
like the number one side for my bottom
lashes this is the one with the kind of
rubber bristles that are a little bit
shorter and I like it because it really
separated my bottom lashes and kind of
make them look a little bit feathery and
they just look really nice I have to say
I have to give the packaging of one
because it's just so ridiculous I think
what does it Maybelline or something
have a double sided mascara and it's
like ten times smaller than this so I
can't stand it I feel like I don't know
it's just too big a mascara I would give
it about a seven it's not something that
I would repurchase like I could go get
the covergirl LashBlast volume the one
that's in the orange too and be
satisfied with that instead of going
back and forth with this side and then
the other side it's just a little
tedious and I mean you could basically
get one mascara to do this to your
lashes please for me so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up if you love first impressions
and I also want your opinion do you guys
for next Friday's first impression

better than sex mascara or the wet and
wild for Aggie BB bomb or BB cream
