close
hi guys so today's video it's going to
be on this New Year's Eve
hair and makeup look I have had this
makeup look before in the video it was
actually in my haul video that I did not
too long ago and I had so many requests
to do a tutorial on it and I definitely
wanted to do one because this is one of
my favorite looks that I've done I love
the glitter
I love the smokiness I love the lashes I
love the glam the glam is where it's at
now the glitter that I did use is this
makeup forever hollow damn powder in
number 303 I got this last year around
this time when they had them out I don't
think they have them out anymore I wish
they would bring it out because I really
wanted the other shade but you know I
love this I know around this time last
year sinful colors also had some
glitters out you can pretty much find
glitters anywhere get some from over the
K two-faced NYX has some glitters you
know and they have all different kinds
of colors as well this one's kind of
like let me see let me see what this
looks like hold on this glitter is like
a green green silver glitter I don't
know it's really pretty but this is
actually a pretty easy look to recreate
we're just using I think three shadows
and then the glitter on top the main
thing if you're going to use glitter
this year that I highly suggest is this
Too Faced shadow insurance glitter glue
this is specifically for putting glitter
on your eyeballs to make sure that it
lasts all day it doesn't get everywhere
because when I use this primer and also
the NARS one which I'll show you how to
use this in the video but when I use
these two my eye shadow and glitter stay
on for so long and my glitter does not
fall out under here on my face so I love
it you need this in your life no matter
what glitter you are using and then this
hair is kind of like my go-to hairstyle
you can watch it if you want but I just
decided to include it in this video
because I love the messiness of it I'm
running on 3rd day hair so I definitely
wanted to you know curl it so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you do like
it please go ahead and give it a thumbs
up and subscribe to my channel for more
videos and I'll see you all in my next
one bye
oh and real quick I do want to ask if
you have any other New Year's Eve
requests like makeup tutorials leave
them down below I am wanting to do an
all-black smokey eye
if you want to see like different colors
then just leave it in the comments any
requests if you have pictures you want
to send send it to my Twitter Facebook
tag me on Instagram of all that
information where you can contact me in
the description box and yeah I'm really
leaving this time bye so the first thing
I'm done is primed my face with my usual
primers and then we're going to go in
with this NARS eye primer and prime the
lids this is perfect for oily eyelids
because your eyeshadows will literally
not crease at all
I'm taking my Mac Paint Pot in soft
ochre and I'm going to use this just to
even out the lids and create a nice
canvas for the shadows that we will be
putting on for today's look we'll be
using the lorac Pro palette I'm going to
take the color taupe with this Sigma
e-40 brush and I'm just going to blend
this all over the crease and on the lid
I'm not being precise with it at all I'm
just buffing it out all over making sure
there's no harsh lines and this is going
to be our transition stage so just be as
messy as you want
speaking of messy I'm taking this deep
purple shade with this pencil brush I'm
going to create my outer V you can see
here I'm just kind of creating of course
a v-shape on the outer half of my eye
and I'm bring this in also on the lid a
little bit and then I'm going to go in
with the color sable and the Sigma e45
which is a tapered blending brush and
I'm just going to blend this all out
full warning you I get very messy with
this that's just I am if you've been
watching my videos for a while but I do
go in and clean up afterwards and it'll
look normal I promise you but since i
don't have foundation on it's a lot
easier for me to go ahead and just buff
these eyeshadows and blend them out and
just be messy with it and then go in and
clean it up and then do my foundation
that's just what i like you can do
whatever you prefer but i'm taking this
all over and just blending it out I
absolutely love the deep purple it's
super harsh but it's not as harsh as
black so I just I don't know I really
love it and this tapered blending brush
makes it so easy to blend this out and
take it into the crease I don't really
go into the inner corner of my eye I'm
kind of keeping that somewhat bare but
I'm just making sure I buff this all
over and get everything blended out I'm
going in with a sigma e25 and I'm just
going to blend out any other lines that
are on my lid because I kind of had some
choppy lines in the inner part of my eye
so this really helped blend those out
and make it look nice and smooth taking
this Mac Pro Neill palette I actually
hit pan on the color that I'm showing
you today I'm really excited about it
and this is what I'm using to clean up
my shadows you can use concealer you can
put tape on beforehand you can use a
makeup wipe but I just like concealer it
helps me use up some concealer so it's
just what I prefer and I'm taking it
with this Sigma brush and just carving
out that outer line and making it nice
and sharp and it's really easy to work
with as well you just kind of carve it
out and blend it in with your finger
this makes such a difference
it is literally insane cleaning up that
eyeshadow just looks so good taking that
efore tee again I'm just going to blend
I'm a blending freak I have to make sure
everything is blended I mentioned it
before if it's not blended to how I
prefer then I will keep blending until
it is even if it means I have to sit
here for an hour and blend I will do
that
now for the fun part we're going to go
in with glitter of course I'm going to
take the two-faced glitter glue first
and I'm going to put this on the back of
my hand like I'm showing you here and
I'm going to take the Sigma F 70 brush
and apply this primer on top of my
shadow to me this is never ruined my
eyeshadow I just kind of tap it on my
lid and sometimes I'll blend it in with
my finger but as you can see it's not
like smudging the eyeshadow or anything
it's kind of laying on top so I really
like it it is kind of sticky so I try to
work quickly with it just so it stays
nice and tacky when I put the glitter on
and it also do put this kind of going
towards the outer half where I did the
darker shades because we're going to
want that glitter to fade out so now I'm
taking the glitter with the same brush
and since that brush still has the
glitter glue primer on it that glitter
is going to really adhere to it and pile
on the lid so beautifully I mean there's
never been a time that I haven't been
disappointed after using this because it
makes such a difference so as you can
see I'm patting on the glitter and I'm
focusing it mainly in the inner part of
my eye but then kind of tapping out a
little bit on the outer half to kind of
fade it out so it doesn't look like
there's a harsh line between the glitter
and then you know the darker outer half
I just put a little bit more of that
glitter glue on the brush went into the
glitter and pressed it back on my eye so
here I'm showing you I'm taking kind of
any excess and putting it towards the
outer half just to kind of blend it out
make it look nice and seamless now
taking a 25 again by far my favorite
brush if I could recommend one blending
brush it would definitely be this one
and I'm just going to blend out that
glitter and again make sure there's no
harsh lines and that everything is kind
of seamless
moving on to foundation I'm using the
Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation in
3wn Thani I've said this a million times
but I'm going to say it again the
foundation looks very light but actually
it matched my self-tanner really well in
person so I think it's the lighting I'm
going to have to adjust but I'm going to
take my mac pro longwear concealer in NC
30 and NC 25 per usual and put this
underneath my eyes and blend it out with
this Beauty Blender or beauty sponge and
the reason why I said Beauty sponge
you'll see that in my video Friday so
just stay tuned for it taking this NARS
translucent crystal powder in my Sigma F
86 I am going to set my under eye area
this does cause a white cast underneath
my eyes which I don't like it's a great
powder but I hate that white cast effect
that it gives because once I zoom in on
the eyes you can really see it and it
bothers the crap out of me now I'm using
mine ours powder in mountain and just
setting the rest of my face makeup and
now we're going to contour with the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer with my
NARS eita brush I'm just going to call
it eita and I'm contouring on the sides
of my forehead underneath my cheekbones
I'm calling Tory my jaw line my nose
everything and you can make this as
dramatic as you want I love a dramatic
contour especially with this brush since
it is so easy to do
for blush I'm using this one from NARS
called deucer and my Sigma f40 blush is
literally amazing it goes to so many
different looks and I think it is just
so beautiful I'm obsessed with it
picking my Becca highlighter in
moonstone in my Sigma f 35 I'm just
going to highlight this is by far my
favorite highlighter lately now I did go
ahead and fill in my brows with these
products I will list them all down below
it kind of takes a little time so I just
went ahead and skip that step for this
video and now I'm going to take cream
for the lot from the lorac Pro palette
and I'm just going to highlight my brow
focusing most of the product on the arch
of my brow and then dragging any excess
on the other parts of my brow so I start
in the center and then work my way out
now I'm going in with my liners I'm
using the Loreal linear intense carbon
black liner and the Kat Von D liner I'm
taking the L'Oreal one first I'm making
sure that I don't make this line too
thick on top I want to make sure that
that glitter is not covered up too much
so I'm just doing a thin line and then
you can go ahead and go thick and
dramatic with your wing because this is
a pretty dramatic look
now I'm going to line my bottom in upper
waterline with the NARS eyeliner in Via
Veneto and then going back in with that
deep purple shade I'm going to smoke out
my lower lash line I'm going to first
apply it with the brush on both sides
and then after I've applied it I'm going
to wipe off the brush and blend out that
shadow just so I don't apply too much
and it doesn't get too messy on me
next I'm going to curl my lashes and
apply mascara I'm using the Maybelline
rocket mascara you can use any drugstore
mascara for this because we are going to
be using a false lashes and don't forget
to apply it to your bottom lashes
because I think bottom lashes are very
very important and don't worry I did go
in and clean up the other lashes right
here because it got a little messy I'm
taking the ardell demi wispies these are
my favorite lashes right now I just
can't get enough of them and then this
is what the eyes look like when they are
all done now we're going to move on to
lips I'm taking my favorite lip combo
right now which is the Revlon Colorstay
lip liner in nude I think this color is
beautiful and literally goes with
everything then taking my favorite nude
which is the wet and wild Fergie daily
lipstick it's not too nude but you know
it's nude enough to not take over the
eyes and then I'm going in with Mac's
lip glass and Flor abundance and you are
done with your makeup moving on to hair
I'm taking this Tresemme heat protectant
it literally smells so good I can't get
enough of it but I sprayed that in my
hair and brushed it out and now I'm
going to curl my hair with the new me 25
millimeter one and I'm doing alternating
curls I did these curls in my Christmas
party getting ready video but I just did
one away from my face and now this one
is going towards my face and I do that
all over my head until I'm completely
done and I also want to let you guys
know that nume megastar flat iron is
back in stock it's my favorite flat iron
and a lot of you have asked me to let
you know when it was back so I will
leave that discount below I do have a
hundred and twenty dollar off coupon you
can check out if you guys are interested
so after you're done curling all of your
hair I'm just going to flip it over
toss it just kind of play with it I love
messy hair I've set it so many times and
now I'm taking this teasing brush and
kind of combing through it a little bit
just to soften up the curls because I
don't want them too curly and then we're
going to take it and tease a little bit
as well I'm not doing any crazy teasing
I'm just taking the brush and back
combing it a little bit just so it has a
little bit more volume and then you are
done with the whole look I hope
