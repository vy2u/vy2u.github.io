a two-part video it's gonna be a New
Year's Eve makeup tutorial and a New
Year's Eve hair tutorial which I am
completed now so yes I decided to split
this up into two parts so we'll be
showing you the makeup today and I will
be doing the hair tomorrow so you will
see this same exact outfit tomorrow but
the makeup just took a little bit longer
and I really just wanted to show you
guys what I did so that's why I decided
to split it up but I really liked the
way it turned out I'm using a new makeup
forever I think it's like the hollow
damn glitter thing I don't know I'm
obsessed with it this is probably what
I'll be wearing on New Year's Eve
because I love it so much if you're
wondering where my top is from it's from
Charlotte Russe and it's pretty badass
and I'm obsessed with it too so yeah if
your instancing how I do my makeup then
just stay tuned and if you're interested
in seeing how I did my hair then just
keep an eye out for tomorrow's video and
you will see it I hope you guys enjoy
this don't forget to like the video and
subscribe and I will see you guys next
time bye okay so I'm going to be doing a
voiceover with no music I'm sorry I just
couldn't get it to work so I'm gonna
start off reason then they'd get palette
today taking the color verb with a flat
shader brush I'm just gonna apply this
all over my lid just gonna create a nice
shimmery base for the loose pigment
we're gonna apply later and it's just
really pretty and I also applied my Mac
Paint Pot for my primer before applying
this shadow now going in with T's which
is an amazing transition color for this
palette sort of a purpley kind of color
I'm just going to blend this into my
crease
next I'm taking the scotch tape I'm
gonna put it on the back of my hand a
couple times just to get some of the
glue off so we're not pulling the skin
around our eye and I'm just going to
follow my lower lash line up to my brow
because I do want a more harsh line on
for this look so I'm just going to do
that on both sides then I'm going on
with busted which is one of my favorite
favorite favorite favorite colors I love
it I'm just going to put this in the
outer V and I'm also blending it into my
crease
going in with a blending
I'm just going to blend that color out
just so it's not super super harsh we
want it to look nice and sort of soft
next going on with foxy which is just a
really great kind of matte cream
highlight color you definitely want a
matte highlight color with this because
we are gonna have so much shimmer going
on
you want some matte in here so this is
the perfect highlight color for this and
for the star of the show this Disney
makeup for ever holiday on powder in 303
I'm taking my brush and spraying it with
a mac fix+
and applying it to my lid just spraying
the brush with the mac fix+ it's going
to help the glitter I hear a lot better
- your lid other than having a plain old
dry brush it's gonna be a lot harder to
apply it then I just take the blending
brush and I just blend out the line and
kind of Pat Diggler on as well so I'm
just doing that on both sides then I'm
going in and just kind of touching up
the busted color and my crease because
some of it kind of was taken away when I
kept blending and then I'm also going to
take that same busted color and I'm
going to apply this underneath my lower
lash line then going back in I'm going
to take black out with that same brush
and I'm just going to apply this kind of
like in a winged motion this just adds a
little bit more depth to the look and I
really like the way it turned out so I
thought it was really really nice going
in with my L'Oreal hip liner I just
lined my waterline with this then taking
the Maybelline master precise eyeliner
this is perfect for this look I just
fell in love with this liner when I used
it today it was awesome it's super thin
and it gets right to the lash line I
didn't want a super thick line I just
wanted something kind of subtle but I
still did do a wing at the end but this
was perfect it was not too much and
didn't apply too much product or
anything so I definitely definitely
recommend this eyeliner if you're doing
a look like this it's just amazing now
time to curl your lashes and apply your
mascaras the ones I used I used in my my
scare routine so if you want to see that
I will link it down below and now I'm
just applying my Rimmel lip liner this
is in natural I love this I mentioned
this whole lip combo I'm about to show
you in my
November favorites so now I'm just
applying Mac scrim to nude perfect nude
I absolutely love it you definitely want
a nude lip with this look because you
got a lot going on with the mouth so
then I'm taking next sugarpie lip gloss
and I'm just going to apply this it's
just the perfect pink kind of nude lip
gloss and it's just it works you know
what I mean I had our on hand taking the
mary lou lou manizer from the balm i
love this this is a great highlight I'm
just going to take a little bit on my
finger because a little bit does go a
long way with this stuff and I'm just
gonna highlight my Cupid's bow and I'm
also gonna put some in the center of my
bottom lip just to make my lips look a
little bit more full and powder and a
little shimmery so I hope you guys
enjoyed this look if you end up trying
it out please send me pictures and I
hope you guys have a great day and I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
