on this look it is just a kind of no
makeup makeup look I've had some
requests for this so I figured I would
do it and my no makeup makeup is still
kind of work bronze in the face just
kind of like that natural sunkissed glow
and then just really really simple eyes
and a nice kind of pink lip nothing too
much I just did a light wash of color
just to kind of liven up the lips slow
it warned
personally I don't like I mean I'll go
out without makeup but I like to have a
little something on just to kind of look
alive so I'm gonna show you some five of
my favorite and I want to introduce you
to a new baby of mine baby she's been
sleeping this whole time and I just woke
her up to get in this video so this is
Daisy she's our new addition to the
family and I just love her she's a lab
golden retriever oh my god her hand my
lip gloss she's a lab golden mix and
she's a sweetest little puppy aren't you
she's four months and we just got her
Friday so I'm really excited
hey some new straw for the primer today
I'm using this Smashbox photo-finish
light this is for people with more combo
to oily skin and I've been liking this
lately so I'm just gonna go ahead and
prime my face with that then I'm using
my Clinique stay matte foundation I
really like this one it just depends on
what you like for your skin you can use
the Garnier BB creme that I love or you
can use foundation I just like to even
out my skin tone this one's not
completely full coverage you can still
see a little bit of redness and stuff
for my cheeks peeking through so that's
why I really like it and it kind of
looks a little bit more natural and I'm
gonna take the Beauty Blender and I'm
just gonna Pat this all over my face to
get rid of any brushstrokes that have
been left over taking the Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer I'm gonna
Pat this underneath my eye and then
blend it out with my Sigma F 86 kabuki I
absolutely love it and this concealer is
really really nice because it's nice and
light and it's not heavy like the pro
longwear so it's great for everyday use
and it looks a lot more natural then I'm
gonna take my makeup forever super matte
loose powder and I set my under eye
concealer and my face makeup with this
so it's really light but it's still
gonna keep me matte all day and set all
of my makeup and then I'm using this
NARS Laguna bronzer with this Real
Techniques blush brush and I'm going to
bronze up my face just applying it on my
cheeks into the tops of my forehead just
to give me a sunkissed kind of look and
I've been really loving these Real
Techniques brushes by the way I think
they're so amazing especially the expert
face brush now I'm going in with Milani
Luminoso this blush is perfect for more
of a natural look because it really just
adds some warmth to your skin and it
gives you a really pretty glow at the
same time so I highly recommend it now
I'm taking my my Paint Pot in soft ochre
I really like this I'm just gonna prime
my eyes with it and it also helps even
out the skin tone of my eyelids and then
taking Mac's
soft Brown I'm gonna apply this into my
crease and just kind of put it all over
the lid I forgot to do a brow bone color
as well but you know keeping it natural
but I love this color for the crease
because it just adds some depth in there
I'm going back to my brow bar to go from
lightening lightening and I'm gonna fill
in my brows with
I really like it because it's just a
really nice powder and it stays all day
but it doesn't look like you filled in
your eyebrows so I like filling them in
nowadays because it just really shapes
my face it makes it look a lot better
and also I have a coupon code for this
down below if you're interested you can
get it for 70% off now I'm taking the
wax and I'm just going to set those
brows in place I'm taking this Milan or
no the Sigma eyeliner in boost I don't
know if they have these out yet they
send them to me not too long ago I think
they're gonna be a new product coming
out but I just tight lined with that
just to make my lashes look fuller and
of course I'm curling them and applying
my favorite mascara at the moment this
falsies big eyes from Maybelline I
really really really like this mascara I
highly recommend it to taking the Rimmel
scandaleyes eyeliner in nude I'm gonna
apply this to my waterline just to
brighten up my eyes and make me look a
little bit more awake and I really like
this eyeliner because it looks super
natural and not you know too harsh like
a white eyeliner would in your waterline
now I'm taking the Maybelline Color
whisper and petal rebel and a clear
gloss and I'm just using this to apply a
little bit of color to my lips but not
too much because it's nice and sheer and
then topping it off with a clear gloss
as well and then that's pretty much it
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
you did don't forget to like it and
subscribe and I will see you guys in my
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
