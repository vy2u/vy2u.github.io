November favorites and I don't have a
lot of products I've kind of been used
in the same products as I did last month
but I slap a few new things I want to
show you guys so I'm going to go ahead
and get started first is my favorite lip
combo I've been using this so much this
month the first thing i've been using is
this remote lasting finish lip liner
this is a natural i love this lip liner
so much that's it right there it's just
so pretty and it's not too dark or too
light and then for lipstick I've been
using this new lipstick from Mac this is
crimson nude and I love this i bought
this this month it's my all-time
favorite nude lipstick it is a cream
machine so it's not going to like
completely you know dry out your lips or
anything like that and that is it right
there right by the Rimmel liner and it
definitely is just a really nice true
nude and then for the lip gloss I've
been using this NYX lip gloss in sugar
pie and this is perfect it's just the
probably the best nude lips class I've
ever owned and that is it right there so
I just really been loving these three
lip products together I mean they're
perfect next favorite is sort of just a
rediscovered favorite and it's this
instant age rewind concealer from
Maybelline and this is in light pale I
used to have the one in honey when I
tanned and everything like that but as
you guys know I don't tan and tanning
beds anymore i'm strictly self-tanner
and i've been using those like crazy I
finally picked it up this month in a
lighter shade and I forgot how much I
loved it until I applied it this month
and I was like oh my gosh i love it
again so i really recommend it it just
definitely brightens up your eyes it
makes you look a lot more awake and i
don't have super bad under eye circles
but if i'm really tired they'll come so
this is great just covering them up and
making me look more alive next favorite
is this covergirl clump crusher mascara
I love this I've been so impressed with
covergirl mascaras I swear but a lot of
you even asked me to the first
impressions on this but I've already
been using it so I can't really do a
first impression video on it but it does
have a curved wand and I real
like it it's a rubberized one also the
curved one on this mess care really
helps just like open up your eyes make
your lashes go up and out and it really
separates them and creates volume so I
like this mascara it's really great so I
definitely recommend this next pick up
product is this Maybelline line stiletto
liner I was watching a makeup bialys
video on liners and I saw this one and I
just had to pick it up it has sort of a
sponge tip which is definitely different
I've never really seen anything like
this before but it's perfect I can
create a really thin line and I could
create a really dramatic thick line as
well and a super pigmented that's it
right there it's just perfect so I
definitely recommend this liner if
you're in the drugstore and you're just
looking for a new one next is these new
wet and wild palettes i got mine from
walgreens i think they were like 499 or
something like that like five bucks
apiece the first one is sparkled til
morning which is an alzheimer palette
and i used these in my last tutorial so
if you're interested i will link it down
below these are just beautiful colors
and i love them and then the other one
is a rerelease palette this used to be
the I Heart mat or something like that
but now it's called drinking a glass of
shine and it's the same exact one that
was the I Heart Matt they just have a
different name for it now so really
really really love these two I think
both of these pallets go so well
together they have great pigmentation
and I just really love them so i
definitely recommend them next product
is this mac fix+ i've been using this
like crazy this month i just like to
spray my brushes and put them on my
eyeshadows just to make my lash or my
eyeshadow a lot more pigmented and
vibrant and I just I don't know I love
the effective at a lot morning for some
reason I feel like it lasts a lot longer
when I spray my brushes and do that and
if you have some shadows that aren't as
tight as you wish they were I would
definitely spray your brush beforehand
and then put it in the eye shadow and
see if that helps so I definitely
recommend something like this if you're
interested next is this skin the Navy
eye makeup setting spray and i have been
using this a lot to it does keep my
makeup on for a hell of a long time and
I know a lot of people recommend this I
know everybody almost in the YouTube
world has talked about this product I
like it more
the Urban Decay ones like the deceased
look and everything I know they're made
by them but I just like this original
version a lot better i also have anyone
to so if i'm out and about and my makeup
looks a little bit to cake face i will
just spray it if there's too much powder
and it really just helps it make it look
more natural and a lot better i don't
know i think they're having a cyber sale
because today is cyber monday if you
don't know it's like black friday but
for the internet awesome best idea ever
but um they might be having a cyber
monday sale so i will put their link
down below if you're interested i
definitely recommend something like this
in your makeup routine lasts makeup
related item is this brush from sigma
this is a tapered face f25 brush i have
been using this so much to contour it's
just perfect blend super easily just
applies it to the perfect place since it
is tapered and i just really love this
brush I think it's perfect for
contouring seriously awesome again I
don't know if Sigma is having a cyber
monday sale but i'll leave the link down
below if you're interested and if i'll
find out and put it in the description
box that they are and then the last
thing i want to mention is this cream
hair bleach i have been dying my
eyebrows i don't know if you guys have
noticed but um this is what i use i
watched nicole which is in Guerrero I
watched her video a couple months ago I
think and she used this for her eyebrows
nose really interested because I had
super super dark eyebrow I wanted to
lighten them so I went got this and I
followed her video step by step and did
mine but I was watching hers and I left
went on for five minutes as well and it
was just enough time and it was perfect
it just really lightened them and I feel
like liar i browse go so much better
with blonde hair like not like super
light where you can't see them but if
you have really dark eyebrows it's good
to just lighten them just a light brown
I think it looks really pretty so I love
this I definitely recommend it to i'll
put her video down below that i followed
so you could check it out as well so
that is it for my November favorites i
hope you guys enjoyed it if you filmed
yours and leave it as a video response

you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
