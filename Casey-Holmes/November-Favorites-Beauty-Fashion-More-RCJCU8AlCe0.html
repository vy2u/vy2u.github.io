monthly favorites I have makeup skin
clothes just a wide variety of things
that I've just been loving so I'm gonna
go ahead and get started and show you
guys what I love
first thing I wanna talk about is
contouring it's not a cream bronzer but
it is a foundation this is a Maybelline
fit me foundation in toffee caramel just
a few shades darker than my skin tone
and I really love this to contour with
mainly because first off it's in the
stick form it's affordable and it
actually blends out amazingly today I
apply it with this Sigma small contour
fo5 I just applied it after I did my
foundation and then I blended it out
with my foundation brush and I don't
have to add a powder contour on top but
if I wanted to be you know a little bit
more dramatic I will but this is an
awesome product to work with you don't
even have to have a brush you could just
kind of like apply it like this but I
like using a brush just so it's not too
harsh
another thing about this foundation that
I love is that it does last all day it
doesn't get splotchy or anything like
that so my bronzers stays looking really
good all day long so I love that I also
want to quickly mention I've been using
a highlighter this month which I don't
really use highlighters all the time but
I've just been really enjoying it this
month mainly because I have this Sigma
tapered highlighter f-35 it just makes
it so easy to apply the highlighter but
I've been using my mary-lou manizer from
the balm I love this one I've said it a
few times I love this more than the Mac
commit or my skin finish and soft and
gentle sometimes I feel like it looks a
little chunky I don't know I just like
this one a lot better I think it's so
pretty it's just a gorgeous champagne
shade and when it hits the light it's
just stunning I actually ordered another
one from Bobbi Brown's holiday
collection which I'm really excited to
try out since I have been using it more
and mainly because of this brush I
really love it putting on two liners
I've been using two different liquid
liners once on the upper lash line and
then one two winged outs so the one I've
been using to line the upper lash line
is this L'Oreal Lemire intense carbon
black liner this is in the color carbon
black I believe it's a very black liner
it's easy to work with but it's hard to
do a wing just because the felt tip is
pretty large and thick it doesn't give
me that flicked out wing that I would
like but this is an awesome liner it
lasts so long but after I do that and I
want to go in with a winged liner
I use this Kat Von D
tattoo liner in trooper has a really
awesome brush tip and it just flicks out
your winged liner and it really is easy
to work with but I got this at a hundred
point perk from Sephora a while back and
I've just been using it to do the outer
part of my liner and I really enjoy it
so this is an awesome liner I don't know
if I purchased it because I have you
know so many different liners to use but
this has been really easy to work with
and I do recommend it and my wing lasts
all day long so that's a plus last liner
I want to mention the NARS
larger-than-life eyeliner in Via Veneto
I love this it lasts so long in my
waterline even when I'm going to take
off my makeup I literally cannot get
this stuff on my waterline it's so good
I just I don't know I really enjoy it
and it is a retractable liner which is a
bonus and it's creamy very very
pigmented and it's just awesome so
that's a little swatch of it this is a
very expensive liner but I think it's
totally worth it I haven't been reaching
for anything else
for the past what like a month and a
half since I purchased this so I love
that I want to mention a blush this is
going to be from Sigma's new collection
that they're launching this number 9th
and they don't tell me I have to mention
these items I just really have been
enjoying them and from the new
collection that they are launching I'm
going to show you a couple things that
are my absolute favorite
so the first one is this terrine a
powder blush and I love this I have it
on today I don't know if you can tell
it's a gorgeous like kind of dusty like
a dusty pink I don't know it is just so
pretty so pigmented so creamy I mean
everything in this collection including
the shadows is just creamy and pigmented
and I'm obsessed I don't often talk
about Sigma palace or collections
because I don't know I don't find myself
really using them all the time but this
new collection that they're launching
I've just been using everything so much
so I have to mention it another thing I
want to mention is this lip gloss that
again will be launching the summer night
it's a lip gloss in the color hint
it's just what was more of a muggy nude
and I really like it
I wasn't sure about the brush tip on the
end but I ended up really enjoying it so
it's a very
my tail like I said I'm wearing it today
and I just think it's so so pretty I've
been really into the mall being nude
you're like darker nudes just because I
think they're really flattering I
actually got this lipstick from a
subscriber when I did my Sigma Meetup so
thank you very much I'm also gonna show
another product that she gave me but
this is the Mac and flavor finery came
out in their holiday collection I do
believe they still have it this is a
very very nude color it's like a really
light pinky nude but I love this because
I'll pair it with like this lip gloss
and it just creates the most prettiest
nude it's not too nude or anything like
that and I've just been really loving
this even with other lip glosses and
just to finish up the lips I'll mention
this you guys have probably seen this a
thousand times my videos the Revlon
Colorstay lipliner in nude I love this
lip liner it has taken over my Stila lip
liner that I used to use all the time
just because I love the color I just I
love everything about it it stays all
day easy to work with it's not super
hard so you happen to tug at your lips
we don't even do with this lip liner if
I'm going to use the flavor for finery
lipstick I'll line my lips and you even
fill them in a little bit just so it's
not super nude then I'll put this on top
and you know top it with a lip gloss and
that's just been my go-to lips for the
month so next up is a foundation I'd be
using constantly I haven't used anything
else just this one and I plan on doing a
review it's probably up before this one
if not it'll be up after this one I'm
getting it up soon though because I want
to inform you guys on some tips and
brushes I like to use and things like
that but it's the Kat Von D locket
tattoo foundation I can see that there's
no more foundation here like it's
scraping off so I am not surprised that
this is gonna be out soon I love the
packaging the pump is fantastic and I
just think this is so awesome now this
month I did find out at the end of the
month that I do have a little bit of
rosacea so if you do have rosacea this
does cover it very well you've seen my
videos without with me not having makeup
on I have a lot of redness going on
right here and it's getting better like
if I just take care of my skin it kind
of goes down and then the girl gave me
some like little samples to try to you
know reduce the redness for
two hours but this does cover it very
very very well like you would never
guessed I have a lot of redness
underneath this foundation and like I
said I'll do a full review if it's up
I'll link it down below if it's not up
it'll be the next video but thanks I
have a three pallets I want to show you
guys first off is one you have seen
again a lot this month is the Smashbox
masterclass 2 palette this again was one
of the gifts that you subscriber gave to
me at Sigma so thank you so much
um I believe her name was Kelsey as well
so thank you so much but I adore this
palette I was actually talking to one of
the girls at Sigma and she had gotten
the Too Faced palette and she said that
the pigmentation was just not there she
didn't like it if she was going to
return it and pick this one up and then
right before I used this she let me know
that she liked this one a lot better and
I agree the pigmentation is just amazing
on these shadows like I use all these
shades I've been really into purples
lately as well I love the gold I love
the champagne the matte highlight this
one down here is a great transition
color this one's great at deepening the
crease love Java I love all of them I
just have been really enjoying it if
you're gonna get a palette for the
holidays I think this is the way to go
next up is the Tarte blush palette one
blush in particular I've been using a
lot in this palette is this middle shade
right here I can't remember the name I
wish they had the names on the back of
this this is the most beautiful kind of
coral shade and I use this all the time
this blush palette is an amazing value
and if you can still find it on Sephora
I definitely recommend you picking it up
because it's just so good it'll make a
great gift for the holidays and the last
makeup item is again from the Sigma
collection that's coming out it is this
palette right here is called warm
neutrals and I have been using this
literally every day since they sent it
out if you're a neutral girl like me and
half the other girls that I know this is
the palette for you I think they're all
amazing the pigmentation is insane if
you think these are not pigmented you
are crazy because they are just stunning
they blend like a dream and this has
just been one of my favorite favorite
favorite palettes like I can't
stop using it since I got it
moving on to brushes I just have four I
want to mention really quickly tell you
the Sigma ones first this one is the
Sigma large powder at 20 this is a great
dupe for the map one I used to use all
the time which is the Mac 134 I mean
they're like identical it's insane I
used both of these for bronzers and the
Sigma one has just been really awesome
and I've also been using this blending a
36 actually mentioned this one to a
subscriber at my Sigma meetup because
it's just a small blending brush and
it's perfect for the crease and just
blending out really dark shades you guys
have seen a lot is the Sigma tapered
blending e45 like it says it's a tapered
blending brush I love this for the outer
V it's just really easy to work with and
it blends at the same time which is
awesome last brunch I wanna mention is
this NARS eat up a brush Ida I don't
know ITA and this is an amazing contour
brush I did a whole video on this brush
which I will link down below but it's
very very good it's the only thing I've
been using the contour my face lately
and it's just oh it is so so good if you
want to check out more about it and I
will link that video down below but this
has definitely been a favorite for the
month
really quickly I'm going to show you
guys my favorite candles the first one
is harvest coffee and I think this was
just like a false scent but I had one of
these and I just fell in love with it so
I went and I bought more they had him on
sell for like $10 so I was figuring they
weren't gonna have them anymore but
they're great I have one here I had
burnt one up already and I got this one
as well so I don't know how these
coffees been one of my favorite scents
for me when I go in the bath and
Bodyworks it is kind of hard to find
candles that I like because sometimes
they're just way too strong for the
apartment and I get a headache and a
couple of the fall sticks like leaves
and flannel they're just so strong they
smell really good but you know I can't
do the super strong smells and just I
can't do that but this one has been so
good this is sparkling icicles I don't
know what what icicles will smell like
but to me this smells clean and it
smells like soap I don't know it smells
really clean if you like clean sense you
will love this candle
okay now for these skin I've been loving
these simple cleansing oil balancing
wipes and I decided to try these out and
give my Neutrogena ones you know kind of
a break I really like these I think
they're are nice and moist and they
really take off my makeup very well they
don't irritate my skin so I every
purchased these probably about four
times another thing from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works this is another product that I
have in my shower and it's almost out
but I wanted to show you a new one
because once I purchased the one that I
have I fell in love with it and I went
out and purchased three more because it
smells really good so cashmere glow stay
in vitamin e shower gel this just smells
it smells so so good it's a blend of
golden peach exotic berries and glowing
lily petals indulge with shimmering
vanilla cashmere Musk
it smells very good and I didn't think I
would like the peaches smell but I I
really do enjoy it I probably does best
on the skin for quite a while at least
on me I feel like it does which is why I
bought three of them next I want to talk
about my glam glow super mud clearing
treatment masque I've had this mask for
a few months now I got this at the same
time that I got my Clarisonic and for
some reason I just did not show it
enough love but this month I've
definitely been using it a lot I'm
almost done with it and I've really been
enjoying it I think it does help
minimize the look of your pores and it
really does take out all the nastiness
in your skin I think it is worth the
money I will be purchasing another one
because I just think it makes my skin
look really nice and if I'm having a bad
break out or something I'll put this on
at night and then the next morning it
just looks so good and I just don't know
I really do enjoy this it's a very
expensive product but it does work very
very well next I want to mention this
little guy is the L'Oreal you code
texture Perfector I don't know if you
guys can see but this is halfway gone
and I love this this has made me
addicted to trying a different serums I
actually ordered an Olli Hendrickson
gift set from Sephora the other day
because I want to try different serums
and that one had like a bunch of
different things I wanted to try out so
if you have a favorite serum leave it
down below
I definitely think
helps with the texture of my skin don't
expect it after like the first day you
need to use it for about a week and
you'll definitely see a difference and I
think this is also helped on my redness
as well so I love this thing it is
expensive at the drugstore but it's a
great product I use it day and night
underneath my moisturizer like it says
and it's just good stuff so this next
product I would talk about is from lush
and I have been loving these lush
products for the past couple of months I
forgot to mention them on my last
favorite so I had to make sure I
mentioned it this time so this is the
fake Buffy I got the big size and this
is so awesome
I struggle so bad with dry legs and like
dry skin because I suck at putting
lotion on after a gala the shower just
because sometimes I'm like I don't want
to do that I don't have time for that I
would hurry up and be done and get
dressed and get my makeup on so this is
awesome because it really moisturizes
your legs and you honestly don't need
lotion it's a really harsh exfoliator so
if you don't like that I wouldn't
recommend it but it's awesome and I want
to try different ones I know they said
there was another one above this one
that people really liked for
moisturizing their legs and I want to
try that so I'm gonna order that next
but this has been so good I have one in
my shower now and I've already used up
another one and it's good I actually
plan on putting this in a couple
people's Christmas gifts so love this so
good and then this is like my favorite
thing from lush I swear to you I'm not
sure the exact name I will put it down
below but it's a massage bar and it's
the strawberry one now I have tried a
few massage bars from lush and they
smell rank I don't like the way they
smell but this one just smells so good
it smells like lunch the lush that I go
to at Lenox Mall it's which is an
Atlanta um it is open like it's in a
Macy's and it's just very open and not
in a closed room I went to lush at the
Mall of America and I could not breathe
in there like I couldn't be in there for
another minute what I like to do is get
out of the shower and put this on my leg
for even more moisture and it leaves my
skin silky smooth I'll put it all over I
would even like this
time just because it kind of gives you
that glow I don't know it's so pretty
and I just love how well it moisturizes
my skin Sabina Liberata a dark tanner
it's the 2 to 3-week tan I love this
with my mitt I've been using it non-stop
this month this is actually your new one
I did finish another one I went through
two bottles already and this is the
newest one so I've been really enjoying
it I think it's a great self tanner -
the leaking problem I had at one point
but so far with this one I haven't
noticed any leaking problems it just
looks very natural to me
so now I'm going to quickly mention to
you my fashion favorites so first is
just a jacket I want to quickly show you
guys it's from H&amp;amp;M and H&amp;amp;M has been
taken all on money lately just because
they have such cute stuff and I recently
been wearing a crop sweater that I
bought from them and they wanted in more
colors but it can't find it online this
is a jacket in Georgia it has been
freezing like a southerners are not used
to this cold weather but this is just
what it looks like it has like a lining
of faux fur on the inside it has the
faux fur around the hood as well and
this has just been awesome at keeping me
warm I do have it in the green and I
plan on getting it in the black as well
but it is just so warm I think it is
about $70 this cold weather you know you
definitely need a jacket like this it's
going to keep you warm and my body at
tough always stays super warm and then
my legs are freezing because half the
time I'm wearing like jeans or leggings
so I adore this if you're looking for a
good jacket I definitely recommend hmmm
now I'm just going to show you a couple
pairs of booties these are the ones that
have been making their appearance all
the time I wear these so much actually
got these almost whole look they're just
plain black booties but they're amazing
they're from the brand Levin Alexander
le uve in Alexander and they're just
awesome I literally get almost all my
booties off of hook look because they
just have great sales plus they have
Nordstrom Rack on there now which is
great but it's so deadly I will leave
that link down below so love these
they're so cute plain black booties I
should adore them and then this next
pair is from Nordstrom they're from
Jessica Simpson and I love these as well
they just look like this their little
brown booties with studs on the back and
like some suede material I love these I
paired them with like forest green pants
and a cream top which I posted on my
Instagram will probably insert a picture
in here somewhere but it looks so cute
and they're so comfortable I'm obsessed
with booties this season like even more
than I am like longer boots just cuz I
think they're so cute
okay so now say for my favorites video
if you stayed til the end then thank you
so much for watching I know
and very long one if you want to know
when I'm wearing rings hair nail polish
all the other kind of stuff I will leave
it in the description box below and
