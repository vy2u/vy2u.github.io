sharing with you my favorites for the
month of October I know this is a little
early just a couple days oh that's okay
but I wanted to go ahead and get this
video up and filmed because I have some
different videos that I want to film
next week for you guys so I wanted to go
ahead just show you some things I've
been loving I don't have actually a lot
of products this month as though so you
know I've been doing like a more fresh
face fresh face book and I did tutorials
so if you want to see it I will link it
down below but I've been doing that so
much um but now that I'm home for a
little while I will be doing much more
experimenting and playing with different
things so yeah I figured I'll show you
guys what my favorites were for this
month and I will also show you my music
favorites so hopefully this is a quick
one probably won't be the first thing I
wanna talk about are these earrings I
have worn these earrings out I got these
at forever 21 and I just love them I
just love how sparkly they are if they
were like 5 80 or something or less I've
been wearing them out you've probably
seen them as so many times in my videos
and it's just cuz I love them so another
favorite is this Elizabeth and James
Nevada Nirvana nirvana dry shampoo and I
really like this is the white version I
also have the black one and I love it
I've also been loving the rollerball of
the white perfume I do like mixing them
together because excuse me but I think I
like the white more I don't know why but
it just smells a little bit more
feminine to me I feel like I was but I
sprayed the black one all over my hair
to whenever I have one downstairs and
one up here but I just spray it all over
and it just gives it a nice fresh scent
like it smells really good so if you're
running on like fourth or fifth day hair
and you're like oh my god my hair is
just not smelling this cuz it was just
spray this all over and I promise you
you will love it and it does last a
really long time I'll spray mine and
then put it up in a ponytail and at the
gym I get when it whips in my face
sometimes I can smell and I'm like yes
it's working so love this I don't
necessarily use dry shampoos so I don't
know how it works as dry shampoo you
know sticking up oil I just use it to
make my hair smell good and it works and
I love it another random favorite are
these cheez-its grooves oh my god
um I tried these at my boyfriend's
parents house not long ago well it was
about two months ago and I fell in love
and I just love these and these are the
white chair window and if I said that
sharp sharp white cheddar these are not
in my diet plan but I'm about to start
so anything is in my diet plan right now
unless people want me to be a crazy
lunatic woman I can eat whatever I want
at this time of month okay so let's talk
about a couple skincare products um I've
been loving these nude whites actually
got these in my gift bag from beautycon
and they're really really great at
taking makeup off I don't use these on
my face all the time unless I really
just been lazy because I don't like
using wipes on my face but this takes
off makeup like all them back in my hand
my lipstick it takes it off really well
so it's the Proactiv makeup cleansing
wipes it has 45 towelettes and I love
the packaging of these because you open
them up but then there's an additional
seal right here so they don't dry out
and they stay nice and wet for a while I
love them I've been using them a time
and I still have a good bit left I'm
pretty sure talents come with like 20 or
something so 45 is a lot and yeah I
really like these highly recommend them
if you're having a hard time getting
your makeup off with the makeup wipes
you're using those are really great I
use like one and I'm done
okay the next game care product I
actually featured in my fresh-faced
video again and this is the skin Iceland
hydro cool firming gels and I love these
they come in a pack of eight and you
open this packet and then they come in
little individual packets and if you
look in that video you could see how I
use them and take them off but they're
really great they're really really
refreshing and they make me feel so much
more awake I just love that cooling
sensation underneath my eyes and these
have just been awesome if I'm feeling
like super tired if I feel like my eyes
are kind of puffy I'll put these on and
I feel so much better and then the last
few care product is this first a beauty
skin rescue oil-free mattifying gel this
is awesome awesome awesome awesome what
I love the most about this is it's a
hydrating gel so gels sink into the skin
very very quickly but this does not dry
out your skin I dunno some gels that
kind of dry out your skin or even some
low
that will dry it out and that's not good
you want to keep it nice and hydrated so
I think this is great for oily skin
because it sinks into the skin
immediately but still keeps your skin
nice and hydrated so I love this so much
if you looking for a new moisturizer I
definitely recommend this one and has it
made me break out and the first day
beauty is a really trusted brand so I
know a lot of people love this brand and
this is great I like all the stuff from
this red line because if you have oily
skin check out the stuff on with the red
packaging because that will help you the
most and it's for oily skin so yeah I
used to talk about their peel-off mask I
still love that I just haven't been able
to find another one so I've been liking
this one a lot also typically shout out
my extensions they have been saving my
life this month I use foxy laughs
extensions and I have them in this
little thing these are my faves I just
got some highlights throughout the end
of my hair know if you guys can see so
I'm gonna have to probably put some in
some of my extension like a couple wefts
but there's a lot of you know I don't
wash my hair every single day so I need
extensions like this just like a couple
left's to put in my hair and to really
give it a lot of volume because
sometimes my hair will be so flat and I
will have any volume or whatsoever so
these are lifesavers I'll also use all
of them are you calling my phone but I
also use all of them for like dramatic
looks like if I'm going out or probably
when is it Saturday Saturday for
Halloween yes I changed my outfit by the
way so you guys should follow me on
Instagram to see what I'm gonna be for
Halloween because I changed it and I'm
really excited to wear it I love these
definitely check them out I do have a
coupon for them I think it's not I don't
think it's a coupon code but you could
get a free gift with your purchase
oh thank the Lord for extensions because
Lord and nose and my hair needs them on
about 4th day hair just needs them ok
last thing is well laughing that's not
makeup related is this Chloe perfume and
this is the rose de Chloe I think or
Chloe de Rosas I don't know I got this
in my Sephora haul which you guys will
see Sunday if you haven't noticed I'm
uploading I started my uploads on Sunday
Tuesday Thursdays and I'm trying my best
to keep that schedule
so I have been doing good this week and
I'm gonna try to keep it up for you guys
but this was featured in my Sephora haul
which you guys will see but I love this
if you like the smell of roses you'll
absolutely adore this it just smells
fresh like roses and it's perfect I mean
I just I love that smell of roses it's
just smells so clean to me and fresh and
it's perfect the only thing I don't like
is that in this bottle is $70 which I
feel like spicy but then again if you're
gonna buy a higher-end perfume it's
gonna be expensive but it does last on
my skin a really long time which makes
it like okay you know so I can use a
little bit of this stuff and it'll go a
long way so Chloe de Rose roses day
Chloe I believe this one is it's really
awesome and like I said you guys will
see it Sunday and my haul pretty little
thing okay so the next thing is this NYX
CC cream this is the color correcting CC
cream it's the green one this says it
contains antioxidants and skin
conditioning ingredients i 100% agree
with that this feels so good on my skin
I've been using this to prime lately I
get used it today I'm gonna also use it
on days that I'm gonna go run errands
and I really really like it it does
neutralize some of my redness but it
makes my skin feel so soft and smooth
and makes my foundation application just
glide on and I haven't found like a CC
primer type of thing at the drugstore
that I like a lot and this is like my
new favorite I really really enjoy this
and to me I feel like it's really
comparable to a high-end primer so
definitely check this out they have
multiple different ones okay the next
one is actually a lip color that I'm
wearing right now but I love the line of
lipsticks I've just been switching out
different colors and it's the ultimatte
lip creams the one I'm wearing right now
is in striking and I love it it's a
matte lip cream but it's not drying
whatsoever it doesn't sink into any of
your lines and it lasts all day long I
did a full video swatching every single
color from Ulta so I will leave that
down below I'll go find it for you guys
like I said I've just been loving them
just trying them out again and just
playing with them just with different
colors and this one's really pretty I
like striking striking is what my
favorite thing you will also see in my
Sephora haul I've just been playing
the stuff and I adore it this is the
girl on lingerie the PO powder
foundation is what it's called this
one's in the shade
Oh for medium beige and I love this so
you do get a little puff in here and
then that's oh hello and then that's the
powder right there I just really like it
it's a very fine powder and it makes you
look
poreless I'm telling you it's so
beautiful I know it's a powder
foundation sorry I just blind to do I
know it's a powder foundation but I use
it to like set in my face makeup and it
just looks so freakin good like it looks
so smooth this is like a newfound powder
that I'm obsessed with and it just makes
my skin look amazing so definitely check
this out it is super pricey but holy cow
I love it it's just it's so good it's so
good and with that I've also been using
this bareMinerals seamless shaping and
finish brush I love this I've been
starting to use I have this kit right
here it says bear brush bar and it was a
kit that benefits it or not benefit who
sent me this bareMinerals sent me a
while ago and I just had them chilling
and I finally broke them all out this
month and this one is by far one of my
favorites and yeah it's just the perfect
shape I use it for powder bronzer
anything to blend up blush it's so soft
and I just I love this brush show show
so the seamless shaping and finish brush
definitely one my favorites try it out
because you can use for multiple
different things for your face next
favorite is da benefit what's up okay I
lost the cap on the end already
but I love this it's the highlight I'm
wearing right now on the bridge of my
nose and right here what that highlight
is it is just a champagne cream
highlight but what I love the most about
this is that it is the cream usually I'm
not big on creams but this is like a
cream to powder type of thing it looks
so borscht on the skin you don't have to
set it with powder and if you have only
skin it does stay in place which i think
is so important because some creams you
know they just start melting and looking
a little crazy this stays in place i
absolutely
love it and the brush I have been
applying it with is this morphe emma
five-to-four brush and i just sit there
and i blend it in just to top of my
cheekbones and then down my nose and
it's just perfect so benefit what's up
awesome
a little goes a long way with this stuff
as you can tell I went a little crazy
today I love it and it's travel friendly
you can also blend it out with this
little guy but I just find it easier to
use a brush turn the last favorite or no
second last favorite I want to talk
about is this NYX bronze NYX is this NYX
bronze blush I'm wearing this today I
don't know if you could really see it
cuz I blended it out a lot but I love
this color it's exactly what it says
it's a bronze blush and it just looks
beautiful has like a golden peachy sheen
to it and it's stunning oh I love this
color these blushes are amazing I know
some people really help others for using
NYX products like in my last drugstore
video people were like going ham because
there's a lot of NYX products but that's
because the quality of their stuff is
just amazing and I loved it and I
thought it's hard to stay away from it
but these blushes blend out really
really really nicely
these are the high definition blushes
and I love them I've been loving some
other colors too but they're put away so
I don't feel like getting them but this
one's one of my current favorite and
it's awesome okay so the last makeup
related favorite are these individual
lashes which I never thought I would
include in a favorites video but I like
these four times that I'm doing a
lighter makeup as well but I just want
some more lashes on some people say that
individual lashes are so easy they just
pop them on and run out the door
it takes me a hot minute ooh somebody's
on and I put on strip lashes a ton I
could put on strip lash like that but
individual lashes I'm like I'm going to
link that let me switch you in oh this
it takes me forever but once I get these
on I'll just use a couple on the outer
parts of my eyes they look so good I
think these are new from house of lashes
I can't remember the name but I'll try
to find them for you to link them down
below as you can see they're really
really wispy and I like that they're not
just like a couple lashes in an end of
individual lash because that would take
me a lot longer
these are thicker and they have
a lot more volume two minutes to them
which I love so if you're a fan of
individual lashes I think it would
really like these because you can get a
serious dramatic clash with these
because they're really really good
alright we are officially done with
makeup favorites and the camera is dying
but hopefully doesn't die because you've
got some good lighting right now and you
can see the fall trees look out TV they
are Oh I mean can I stay like this
forever that golden color I'm so
obsessed it gives me such a good little
backdrop and we're gonna go to music
favorites and I kind of don't remember
what I've been loving this month because
I've just been going with different
things oh I've been loving practice by
Drake this is an old song but I I really
like I've been getting into it this
month
I can tell then money's catchy
oh my god also have been loving Jumpman
by Drake I love it this song it's old
but I still love it it's jay-z's I want
to love you I don't know why I've been
loving this
okay so my camera just died on me when I
was singing that last song but those are
pretty much to all my favorites for this
month I hope you guys enjoyed it I know
it wasn't like too many things but this
month I will be experimenting with a lot
