my October favorites and I'm so sorry
it's late I did try to film this once so
don't mind the swatches we'll get to
those in a minute
I'm so sorry that this is late I've just
been so stinkin busy I've been trying to
film different videos for you guys
bigger videos I'm going out of town in a
couple weeks to Puerto Rico for my
birthday I'm going to Actives this
weekend for the ginger armor game and
I'm trying to get this house I found my
perfect house so now it's all about
getting paperwork together and my mind
is just like no I don't even know where
to start with my life I'm thankful and
blessed and I'm busy I really am but
that's those are my excuses for not
having a video in a week and you guys
know I normally don't do that and
usually my favorites videos are like
ahead of time so I loved only these
videos and I wanted to still Finland for
you guys even if it is almost halfway
through the month sorry but I hope you
guys don't mind it's a little bit late I
just I had to film it for you because I
had so much stuff I needed to talk about
that if I talked about next month you'd
be here for an hour
oh I have a little bit of everything I
have some random stuff I have some
fashion items and things like that so
we're just gonna go ahead and get
started with the random items because
yeah I just love starting the videos off
like that the first random favorite of
the month is this tea the Tonto Tonto I
don't know ice it green tea and I just I
love this stuff I'm an iced green tea
kind of person and iced coffee I don't
really like hot drinks because no I just
never really liked hot drinks I don't
like drinking them they're just they
make me hot and I don't like being hot
so yeah this is where my favorite green
tea I don't have any sweetener to it I
believe if this isn't the same one that
they use it star bucks they use I think
the same brand and it's just amazing a
super easy to make
next a favorite I want to talk to you
guys about is this bath and Bodyworks
body wash it's called mad about you and
in so oh it smells so good you guys
actually went to back the Body Works
yesterday and got some fall candles cuz
I hadn't gone shopping for fall candles
and forever and I went picked up six
more of these cute emoji hmm I know
I've got six more it was by three
three free so that's kind of like my
excuse but this is such an amazing smell
and last on your skin for so long and I
just love it it says this passionate
scent is a thrilling blend of
blackcurrant bright peony and pink
Jasmine kiss with white patchouli and
vanilla musk I've noticed I'm a really
big fan of penises right now so yeah
this is just Bob you meet in your life
really quickly I have to shout out my
favorite cell terror if you've been
watching me since last year I've been
using this non-stop and ever since I
discovered it I cannot find a cell tower
that tops it this one is just like my
golden child and this debate on Liberata
2 to 3-week tan and dark I mentioned
that before I don't agree with a 2 to
3-week claim but this self-tanner is
amazing it's not too red it doesn't have
too much of a green undertone it's the
perfect natural bronze tan eye I just
love it you guys I can't stop using it
and especially now that we're getting in
the colder months this has just been
used non-stop okay so the next thing I
want to talk about is hair I just really
quickly want to mention my nume lustrum
set I I love this since I'm only
traveling so much this month this is the
set that we'll be taking with me and
just because it's so compact and all you
got to do is just undo it like that and
it rolls out and it's perfect you could
even like hang it up like this on a
doorknob probably not a doorknob but a
hook or something and it would be good
to go I mean I just love this thing I
currently have it right here with the
bigger barrel because I've been using
the bigger barrel on my hair recently I
believe it's the 32 millimeter and I've
also been using the 25 millimeter on my
hair as well I just love it i've been
using new me since i started my youtube
channel and i know a ton of companies
and a company that i work with has these
six in one curling set but to be
completely honest i always go back to my
nume sets and my name meet curling irons
and my megastar from them it's just what
I know and what I love and I just I
don't know so if I had to recommend any
set to you it would definitely need the
nume lustrum set and i do have a coupon
code if you guys are interested they
give me one in my last video so if you
want to check that out I will leaving it
down below but no pressure I'm just
saying this one definitely
my favorite set and I highly recommend
it speaking of hair products I've been
loving this alterna caviar daily
densifying song it says it saves up to
1,300 strains a month I don't know how
you gonna figure that out but anyways
it's free of parabens sulfates polenta
lights and since that color and I love
this stuff you guys this stuff is just
amazing I don't know it just makes my
hair feel super thick and full and it
feels like my hair is not falling out
every five seconds so I guess they're
kind of true about this saves up to
13-under strands I don't know how they
figure that out but I love this I put it
into my hair care routine and I've just
been really enjoying it in the texture
and the fullness it's been giving my
hair I don't even really straighten my
hair much anymore I'll just blow dry and
it's nice and full and I'll leave it
like that since my hair kind of dries
actually straight anyways so yeah I've
been loving this I love the alternate
caviar brand my favorite by far for my
hair I just I love it next thing I want
to mention to you guys is my perfume and
this is Gucci Guilty this is so amazing
I I know I'm like everybody else on
YouTube but I cannot describe the scent
what I can tell you is that it's just
very sexy and feminine and just like
mature and I love it like it's so
amazing so if you have not smelled Gucci
Guilty yet you need to go take your nose
to Ulta wherever and smell it it took me
a while to get this perfume because I
couldn't decide if I wanted it or not
and then I was finally able to get it
and I'm so happy I did next up is
fashion favorites and first up I want to
mention these boots from forever 21 I
just got these these past month and I
love them and there's just really edgy
and fun or just these nice basic combat
boots with a really thick chunky heel
and they're just edgy I love them this
is like my style in the fall in winter
time but I believe these aren't that
expensive so if I can find them I will
definitely link them down below for you
guys and then another thing I want to
talk about a lot of you notice the
clutches I have back here and I love my
Tory Burch clutches I just I love my joy
wears clutches
I don't purchase like big full purses
anymore because ever since I purchased
my Louboutin speedy back in January
February maybe December last year I
don't know I purchased it a while back
there's no other person I want that was
like my dream purse that I had to have
and my mindset was focused on that purse
and now that I have it I want nothing
else but clutches and going out persons
are definitely a different story I'm
always trying to find the perfect one
and finding new ones and I love I got
two new ones from Tory Burch this past
month that I've just been loving and I
wanted to just share with you first one
is this one it's like a canteen bag oh
no that's what they called it on the
side I believe but I got these off of
Saks Fifth Avenue calm
I will try link them frame below but I
just love this this is so beautiful it's
so big it's like as big as my face it
fits a lot of stuff I love clutches and
stuff that fit a lot in it and I just
love this I think it's so cute and fun
and it's simple it just had the little t
embossed in it and I just love it it's
just my favorite and then the other one
I have I don't remember what this is
called but it's really pretty I like
this one for more casual outfits or
dressy outfits it's just a really great
you know smaller purse so this is what
it looks like it has like little tassels
right here you have a little front
pocket right here which I love for my
cell phone when I'm going out and a back
pocket and then the inside is really
nice and big and you can see all my
goodies in there I got a tampon and some
powder you know that's just what
everybody wants to see the cool thing
about this one though is like you can
hold it like this or you can just pull
the strap through and wear it as a
crossbody this way which is why I'll be
using for the Auburn game coming up this
weekend so I love this it's super
gorgeous and the leather is really
really nice so that's all of my fashion
favorites for the month and now we are I
have water on my face
Estee Lauder is really good I spilled
water on my chin like four times already
today and nothing's came off so I love
you FDLR Delaware you're my soul mate
moving on I want to talk to you guys
about some makeup products I've been
loving and most of it is
lip products like I went lip product
crazy and November not November October
and I just have a lot to show you but
first I'm going to show you all the
other stuff that I have for him so the
first part I want to talk about is the
honest sobs yet to mana palette this is
such a gorgeous palette I knew I was
gonna love it the moment I got my hands
on it
of course sangria Bengal chocolate and
gilded are my favorites I just love them
I knew they were gonna be my favorites
the moment I got this palette I actually
had Bengal chokolate and fresh which is
this the cream shade on my eyes today
and new are is so gorgeous as well it's
just a nice black but it's very creamy
and intense all of these colors are
really velvety and beautiful and a blend
amazingly next I want to talk about my
brow products I've been loving for the
past today in lipstick Oh me
how did that happen I want to talk about
my brow products I have been loving the
past few months like this is just my
brow my brow baby
we're just meant to be together I'm
probably not gonna purchase another brow
product until I finish this one up this
is the Mac fluidline brow gel cream and
deep dark brunette like just look at
that dip that's intense for a brow gel
I mean I'm just saying that's a lot this
is the perfect brow product it's so easy
to use so easy to blend I just love this
product so easy to work with and it
looks really great on the brows I have
on my brows today I have it on my brows
every single picture you see on
Instagram every single video you've seen
for the past couple months this is just
a my brow product and I highly recommend
it they do have two more shades I
believe they have one for redheads and
blondes so I will link that down below
so you guys can check it out if you're
looking for a new brow product that
stuff is hands-down the best I have I've
tried in a really really long time I
really quickly want to mention that this
gel liner it has absolutely no writing
on it but this is a BH Cosmetics gel
eyeliner I was using my L'Oreal one and
it's pretty nice
but this one just it doesn't dry out on
me and it lasts for a really long time
it dries matte and I'm not sure how much
it cost or I'm pretty sure it's not that
much since it is from BH Cosmetics
but if you're looking for a new a gel
eyeliner
commend this one it doesn't like bleed
anywhere or anything like that and I've
been using it for the past month and a
half and it hasn't dried out on me
either so BH Cosmetics gel liner in
black is perfect and I kind of like the
sleek packaging with nothing on it it's
really sexy it's sexy Oh
moving on to a new bronzer I'm loving
this is--these smashbox bronzed
light-skinned bronzer and Sun Tan matte
this is just beautiful it's not too
orange and it's not too red it's just
right there in the middle I have it on
today to just bronze and warm up the
skin I didn't use it to contour because
I feel like it's a little too warm but I
did use it just to warm up the face like
all the temples cheekbones and then
right at the neck and it's beautiful
this stuff is very very pigmented you
don't need a lot of it at all just take
your time with it but it is absolutely
stunning and this product blends like a
dream it's just one of my favorite
bronzers that I've come across I was
using Mac's give me Sun for a while and
then I discovered this one at Sephora
whatever I did that haul and I've just
been loving it so I highly recommend
that favorite blush of the month has
definitely been this Mac Pro Longwear an
eternal Sun oh my gosh I've been using
this in sane like every look I've been
doing no matter if it's colorful if it's
neutral this blush has been on my cheeks
and it's an eternal Sun like I said and
this is just a like pinky Bobbi Brown
kind of color that's it right there it
is so beautiful and with a contour and a
highlight oh my gosh it is so stunning
you could even use this without any
bronzer or anything like that just
because add some warmth to the skin it
does have shimmer in it I believe yeah
it has shimmer in it but you cannot tell
on your face it's really really fine I
can't remember if I got this at a CCO or
not I will try to find it online for you
guys and if I do I'll link it down below
and then I really quickly want to
mention two eyeshadows from Sigma this
is in the color reveal and then this
one's in the color gossip I did a whole
makeup tutorial using these two shades
and another orange from Mac but these
are my favorite very very creamy
this is them right there those too I
don't know what happened with Sigma and
their eyeshadows and like makeup because
they had like a bunch of individual
shadows on there a while back and now
it's like you can't find these colors at
all so if you have Sigma palettes I
would definitely look in your palettes
and see if you have these shades because
these two together are beautiful even if
you don't have these shades just use a
nice purple and an orange and I'll link
my oil down below so you can check out
what I did but I love them these are
just so stinking beautiful and they sue
my eyeshadows are legit like they're
very creamy and very very pigmented and
just so easy to blend okay saving the
most for last which is lip products let
me just let me just show you away Oh
many lip products I have I used to not
be a lip product junkie but now it's
like what the hell fall fall business to
me I'm blaming fall the first one I want
to talk about is the Maybelline and
matte lines that came out in October and
destiny I can't remember how is so late
on getting these but this was in the
color divine line and this is so
beautiful it's a deep wine it's
beautiful its net it's not drying and I
love this I would I would pick this up
over any Mac dark shade to be quite
honest with you this is just so stinking
stunning and it's creamy that's it right
there on my hand that's how it got there
rubbed off on my thumb hmm that's it
right there so beautiful you guys I also
recommend a touch of spice which I don't
have touch of spice right now it's
actually my purse but it's a nice darker
nude and it's oh it's so beautiful
another one I want to talk about is this
Kat Von D everlasting a liquid lipstick
and Lolita now this product is insane
it is like paint for your lips this is
it right there when I filmed this video
mmm I did a swatch a bit and you can see
how map it is at first its creamy and
you think it's not going to dry matte
but once you let it dry it is there
stay it's a nice kind of purply brown
and it just looks so stunning and makes
your lips look freakin huge and it just
I don't know I love the darker mommy
tones of her fall they're really in
Thank You Kylie Jenner for bringing in
the darker nude lips as well we all know
she did it but I'm loving them I think
it is just absolutely beautiful and this
is something that is worth the money Kat
Von D knows her ish when it comes to
makeup because all the products I tried
from her are amazing so the next lip
product is this lorac Pro matte lip
pencil and pink taupe this is like my
everyday lip color it's so pretty
exactly what it says a pink taupe shade
right there nice in that I love these
Laura Pro matte lip pencils I have quite
a few of them I have rose brown this one
another darker shade of ma be shamed the
nude I just I love these again these
ones aren't very drying at all I do like
to use a lip liner with them because if
I don't I feel like it looks a little
messy so I'll add a lip liner like this
one from Lancome this is another
favorite this is in the shade new tan
I will line my lips with this color
which is just a nice Mavi nude again you
can see it's very very similar to pink
taupe so I'll line my lips with that
then fill it in with the Muraki color
and it just gives me that darker pinky
nude and I love it it's just beautiful
this has been one of my go-to nude lip
combos I have a couple other ones in
here but this these two together are
beautiful do not underestimate this
Lancome lip liner in nude tan because it
is so creamy you can use this as like a
lipstick it is this just it's the best
lip liner ever and if you guys don't
know my best friend Serena actually
works at a Lancome I will leave this
store that she's act down below that's
how I found this lip color I was in
there because she works there now so I
don't really have a lot of Lancome
products so I was just like testing out
all the products and talking to her and
I saw this one and I tested it out and I
was like shut up this is me this is me
I've been talking about for way too long
cool let's move on last thing is this
Mac lip liner in morning coffee I've
never heard anyone talk about this but
it is so beautiful
kind of reminds me of a lighter version
of Lolita same kind of purple undertone
very nice Bobby Brown lipliner and it's
really really creamy this is the pro
long wear lip pencil so you could even
use this as a like lipstick and it's
gonna last for a really long time so Mac
Pro Longwear lipliner and a morning
coffee has been another one of my
favorites I think that is it for this
video that's gonna wrap it up for me I
hope you guys enjoyed this long video
