today we are going to be doing this
makeup look right here you guys know I
love orange orange makeup this is one of
my favorites I love orange eyeshadows
orange blushes anything like that orange
bronzers just kidding sometimes but I
absolutely adore orange eyeshadows are
just one of my favorite things to wear
on my eyes I love it with brown eyes
chorus orange looks beautiful and the
other eye color as well on my brown eyes
I love the way it makes them pop and
like bringing out the lighter reflex in
my eyes I just love it so I'm going to
be showing you guys this tutorial I did
film it a while ago but I wasn't happy
with the way that it turned out so I
refilmed it today because I've had so
many requests on these Instagram photos
and I mean you guys are wanting it so
bad so I decided to sit down and film it
for you now for lip color I went with
more of a pinky nude a darker pink nude
but you could always use whatever new
you want you to use a light nude I have
personally worn a chocolate lip with
this orange eyeshadow and I loved it
course that's a little bit more ballsy
but I love that look with the chocolate
lips in the orange eyeshadow so if you
guys want to see how I got this
completed makeup look then let's just go
ahead and get started
okay so getting started I'm just going
to apply a base this is from a drugstore
I should have palette and I'm just
taking the cream and the white shade to
put all over the lid to make sure we
have a nice light even base to work with
next up we're going in with this advise
art palette we're going to take the
lightest orange in the palette with a
fluffy blending brush we're going to put
this all into the crease you don't have
to be very precise with this it can be
kind of messy just make sure you blend
it out really well this whole look is
about building colors and blending like
crazy there's no sharp cut crease or
anything like that
that's what makes this look pretty easy
to achieve so again just blending this
into the crease and then we're going to
go in with the darker orange in just a
second going in with this shade I'm
taking a smaller blending brush and
focusing this into the crease and a
little bit on the lid as well I love
this orange it is so pretty I just love
it
I feel like I look super messy when I'm
first applying all this eyeshadow and I
think I was just like kind of being
careless but it ended up working out it
ended up working out so I made sure I
blended a lot in this video I also take
it pretty far into the inner part of the
eye kind of towards where the beginning
of the brow is but then I'm going back
in with my first brush and blending out
that dark orange as well now the first
orange was our transition shade so you
don't want to go above that but you can
get pretty close to it
next up we're going in and mixing these
two shades I'm taking more of the first
shade that I dipped my brush in and
applying this to the lid now this color
combo right here are these colors that I
just use are pretty patchy you can see
on my eye it honestly took me forever to
build this up I'm not going to keep you
here for the 20 minutes it took me to
build it up but it did take me a while
to build these colors up I had to go in
pack them on blend out the crease pack
them on again it was just kind of a
difficult situation so keep that in mind
if you want to purchase this palette
that you are going to have to work with
those two shades so again I just apply
the lid color blend out the crease and I
take the first orange that I use I think
one more time but for the rest of this I
just blend out with the same brush and I
don't add more product so just use that
mine then I went back in with my first
brush no additional product and just
blend it out the edges as well just
smooth everything out and made it look
nice and blended taking this Lancome
liquid liner I like it but I don't like
it it does not hold a lot of product on
the felt tip so I don't recommend it
only reason why I'm using it is because
I can't find my makeup forever one
taking the Smashbox primer water this is
that weird I'm going to spray my face
with that and then go in with the pore
minimizer and put this all over my skin
to create a nice smooth base my texture
has been pretty intense lately so just
try and take it now smooth it out so
next I'm going in with these to do skin
foundation you guys know I love this it
just works in all form of a light which
is amazing that's what it was formulated
to do it's formulated to look the exact
same and no matter what kind of lighting
you are in you can go from daylight to
florescent like anything like that and I
love the fact that it's buildable it's
just such a beautiful foundation I've
been using it so much lately and then
I'm also going to use a concealer this
is a 24-hour concealer the foundation is
15 which is awesome
these lasts all day long on my skin and
I always get compliments when I wear
this combo so I just love using it
because it's really lightweight but it
looks so flawless then I'm going in with
my flower beauty powder and lo1 and I'm
just going to set everything and let it
bake
went ahead and do my brows off-camera
and then I'm going to go in and dust
away the baking that we just did and
then it's time for bronzer this is the
Catrice Sun globe at bronzer now when I
noticed in this video while applying
this makeup is this bronzer can be
patchy in a minute like it can be I
don't know sometimes it's nice and even
but sometimes it's patchy and I have to
go in and I have to really blend out
that bronzer to make sure it doesn't
look too crazy so I had to choose
between this one and the Neutrogena one
I would go with the Neutrogena one but
yeah I figured I would just let you guys
know that taking the Catrice prime and
fine contour palette going to take the
contour shade and contour my face of
this I love it has a nice actually
undertone to it and I think it is
absolutely beautiful and it's easy to
blend out you see this stippling brush a
lot in this video because I put my
stippling brush to work blends out
everything
going in with a blush this is the Ulta
velvet blush in princess and this is a
gorgeous neutral color it's great kind
of like a warm pink shade and I just
love it it doesn't take away from the
eye look but it also contributes a
little bit more warmth to the look so
that's why I love it I think it's
beautiful
moving on to highlighter I'm going to
take the makeup geek kathleenlights
collab and going to take the more goal
to show you the palette I'm gonna
highlight my face with this I cannot
find my highlighting brush anywhere you
guys I feel like I'm gonna have to
repurchase it for mom Stasi as my
favorite so I use this big old brush to
apply highlighter so sorry to highlight
kind of everywhere and then I'm going to
highlight my brow and inner corner with
that same palette the eyes aren't
palette doesn't really have a matte
cream or anything like that to highlight
with so I'm just going to use the
highlight that I use on my face I like
to do that anyway so that the highlights
are kind of in sync together I think it
looks really nice taking this makeup
geek eyeliner I'm going to line my
waterline and I think this adds a lot to
the look it is just such a beautiful
burgundy plum color I love it I think
it's stunning then we're going to go in
with these two orange shades right here
just mixing them together with a pencil
brush and I'm going to buff this
underneath that lower lash line to add
some orange underneath there and really
warm it up
after that I'm just gonna apply mascara
to the bottom lashes I think it's really
important to even out the lashes on top
with the lashes on bottom by the way I'm
wrangling the lashes I don't remember
what style they are but I really love
Lena lashes she has great styles I'll
leave her link down below but I'm taking
this Palladio lipstick in a raw silk and
I thought was a little too dark so it
went in with a two-faced liquid lip just
to lighten it up I'll leave the colors
down below for you guys and when it
dried it just looked absolutely stunning
and then that is the completed look it
is so easy so pretty I love this for
fall and I hope you guys love it as well
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
leave in the comments which you thought
the look and I will see you all in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
