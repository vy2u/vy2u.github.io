be on this blue eye look that I did I
post a picture on Instagram and asked
you guys if you wanted tutorial on it
and you guys said yes so I did one for
you guys I really like it it's
definitely different than the neutral
colors again like I do but I really like
this one I actually like blues better
than purples I don't know I feel like
blues are really nice they do like
purple though but I really like the way
this turned out so I hope you guys
enjoyed it the only thing I don't show
on this video is what I have on my face
before I put my concealer on which is
the hydroxy tone BB cream this is in tan
talked about in my August favorites I'll
link that down below so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you
all next time
bye okay so the first thing I'm doing is
taking my dermablend concealer this
isn't stable and I'm just gonna apply
this to my cheeks where I have some
extra redness I want to cover I love
this concealer I think it's really
really fabulous I'm also using a crown
brush sort of buffer brush by the way
then I'm going to take my Mac Paint Pot
in soft ochre and I'm gonna go ahead and
prime my eyes then I'm taking this
amazing cosmetics amazing concealer and
light golden and I love this stuff oh my
gosh it's amazing and I'm just going to
apply this underneath my eyes and don't
forget to Pat in your concealer just so
you can get more coverage other than
rubbing your concealer all underneath
your eye padding is just so much better
then I'm taking that same brush I'm just
going to blend out any lines and also
Pat that concealer underneath my eyes
then I'm taking my makeup forever HD
powder love this stuff and I'm going to
use it elf blush brush and I'm going to
set my under eye concealer on both sides
as well then I'm taking my Holy Grail
powder this is the cover top 10 powder
from Physicians Formula and I'm just
going to put this all over my face to
set all of my makeup now I'm taking the
barely beige color tattoo it's a newer
one that came out for the Fall
collection and I'm placing this all over
my lid just as a nice sort of champagne
base then I'm taking my NYX jumbo eye
pencil and milk going to apply this in
the inner parts of my eye and around my
tear duct just to brighten my eye and
I'm taking a lip brush that's all I have
at the moment so use whatever you want
your fingers are brushed anything it
doesn't really matter and just pull in
that out now I'm taking the NYX glitter
mania pigment in blue with a concealer
brush like this I'm also gonna be
spraying it with a mac fix+ spray just
to help the glitter pigment adhere
better to the brush and also go on the
lid a lot better as well I have to say I
didn't have as much fun at all as I
expected to have so I'm going to create
my wing and I'm really just gonna pack
on this color until it's a really nice
blue I just thought oh this is really
pretty it might be too glittery for some
people but honestly it's really not that
much it looks so beautiful
so again just pile that color on from
about halfway on your lid out to the
outer corner
then I'm taking this nice roll on
shimmer I do believe it's in seafoam and
I'm going to apply it in the middle as
well this will sort of give it a
transition color and sort of give it
that ombre effect and I love these two
together they just look so pretty and
I'm going to take that same concealer
brush I'm just going to blend these two
together then I'm taking this blending
brush and I'm taking naked from the
first Naked palette and I'm applying
this in my crease just to have a
transition color then I'm going in with
the new mix glam liners this one's in
Azure I do believe and I'm just going to
accentuate the outer wing and go all of
it into my crease as well and once you
put the pigment on top of this it's
gonna look a little bit darker so I
really liked that for the outer part of
my eye so again I'm just putting that
pigment on the outer part then I'm
taking the BH Cosmetics this is the blue
from the 121st edition color palette and
I'm just going to deepen up that outer
corner a little bit more as well then
I'm taking just a regular fluffy brush
and blending everything together to make
them look seamless
also going back in with naked and the
crease as well then I'm taking virgin
and this is going to be my inner corner
highlight and also my brow highlight
then I just took an angled liner brush
sprayed it with the mac's fix+ as well
and I'm pressing the NYX blue pigment
underneath my eyes and I absolutely love
it it looks so so so pretty
then I'm taking this L'Oreal hip liner
and I'm just walk lining my waterline
and I'm also going to be tight lining
which is just lining the upper waterline
then I'm taking this my seen liquid
liner and I'm just going to line the
natural shape of my eye
and we're gonna curl our lashes and
we're going in with my favorite mascara
which is the covergirl LashBlast volume
you apply this to your top lashes then
I'm taking cover girl lash perfection
oops a flash perfection and putting on
my bottom lashes so now I'm taking Mac
my skin finish and give me Sun I'm using
this as a bronzer putting it on my
cheekbones right underneath my jawline
and also on the tops of my forehead then
I'm taking this revlon soft nude
lipstick one of my favorite nudes ever
and I'm just going to apply that and
then on top for lip gloss I'm using NYX
mega shine lip gloss and sugar pie and
I'm also going to apply this on top and
it just looks really pretty
I wanted to eyes to be the main focus so
that's why I went with a really nude lip
and that's pretty much it I hope you
