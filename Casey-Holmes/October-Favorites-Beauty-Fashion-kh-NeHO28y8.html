my favorites video and I know this is
going up pretty early but I really
wanted to kind of film it get it out of
the way since I know what I've been
loving this month and i just want to
show you guys because i have a few other
videos i want to start filming so i feel
like i'm gonna get busy and kind of
forget about it and I love doing monthly
favorites so I didn't want to like not
do one but yeah we're just going to go
ahead and get started and have a lot of
lip products this month because as you
can tell from like my past few videos
I've just been loving them really
quickly I wanna let you guys know that
it will have all these products as long
as I can find them on website I'll have
them linked on my luvocracy.com triste
but you can buy the stuff that you see
instead of like seeing it clicking on it
and it leads you to another world so I
really do like luvocracy.com buy it if
you are interested in it okay so the
first thing I want to talk to you guys
about is blush and the first blush I'm
using a lot this month is Melba Melba is
like a gorgeous color and I really feel
like it goes with everything you can't
go wrong with this color if you've never
bought a blush it back before I feel
like this will be a great blush to buy
because it just it goes with so much
like literally it's just one of those
colors as beautiful no matter what and
another one is from the recollection or
the Rihanna whatever this one's called
bad girl gone good this is like the main
thing I was really excited to get and
then I wanted from the collection and
this color is stunning it is so
pigmented and the color is very
different from anything I have in my
collection it's like a peachy bronze I
don't know it is so pretty though I love
this blush like I said it's very very
pigmented it's a satin blush and I'm
super happy I was able to pick that up
because I know dealing with that
collection when it came out it was such
a pain this week really quickly want to
shout out my two favorite bronzers for
the month I've been using my Bobby Brown
bronzer in golden light I have been
using it so much
good I can't find this on so forth
website only find it in store so I don't
know if they have it as a different name
on the Sephora website I don't know but
I get mine in store and then another one
I've been contouring with and using to
use as my nose contour as well its of
course the benefit hoola I bring this
out every few months and you guys always
see it in my favorites video because
it's just I don't know like I forget
about it and then I go back to it and
I'm just like yeah I don't know I really
love it for my nose contour for the
month I had to mention this brush is the
mac 163 brush and this is really nice
I've been really really enjoying it to
contour my nose it's really easy to work
with I was taking this brush from Mac
the 2 12 which is a really thin flat
brush I was using that to line my nose
and then blend it out but it just was so
tedious and this is so fluffy like I put
it on my nose blending out just a little
bit and good to go so I love this is
kind of similar to that NARS brush but
it's really really dense i actually
ordered the NARS brush like forever ago
but I didn't know it was on back order
cuz I don't think they're selling it
online anymore but mine's been on
backorder for like ever now so but when
it comes in I will compare the two and
see which one I like better is this brow
gel it's the honest hacia Beverly Hills
brow gel and brunette and I love this
it's so good it holds your brows down
amazingly and I really like the color if
I feel like I went a little too dark
with the brow Wiz then I just put this
over top and it really lightens up the
brow it makes it look a lot more natural
so I like this a lot it's a really great
brow gel for powder I have been loving
my Mac prep and prime translate what is
it transparent finishing powder and this
is very nice i I don't know i don't know
if i could say if I like it more than
the make up for ever one yet but I've
been using it a lot and a lot more than
the Norris powder that I bought and it
just creates a nice smooth finish to the
skin and it just looks really gorgeous
and never powdery so I do like this
product a lot and then for I shout out
we have this makeup geek eyeshadow and
creme brulee this is like freaking
phenomenal I love this eyeshadow you
guys I use it all the time now I
never touch soft brown by mask anymore
like this one is my go-to it's cheaper
than the mac ones and it's a lot more
pigmented they blend out beautifully I
just oh I love love love this color this
stunning you guys I'm not even joking
moving on to the biggest part of this
favorites video it is lip products and I
really quickly want to talk to you about
nudes these two I mentioned before if I
just want to give them a quick shout out
this is a Fergie daily lipstick from
wet'n'wild and it's just a nude I have
it on today it's so pretty it doesn't
look too nude it's just a nice nude
shade so love that oh and also I want to
mention the next butterball some creme
brulee I talked about this one a lot but
I actually didn't notice the smell until
this month it smells like skittles and
it smells delicious so I love this it's
a really appreciate and I do have both
of those on my lips today another 1 i've
been using a lot this month is urban
decay's lipstick in native I have native
and naked to my natives just just been
my go-to it's such a pretty color and I
didn't think I would like this because
of how pink it is but this paired with
the NYX lip gloss I just really enjoy it
it's a great kind of nude pink lip and
the packaging of these is just so cute i
love these urban decay lipsticks now
moving on to the darker side of things
you guys not gonna mention this I can't
manage it pattu from Mac of course I
love rebel I have a few videos featuring
um this one so I will link those down
below but rebels just a gorgeous kind of
berry color I think people are a lot
more intimidated by this I know when I
first started wearing this dark lipstick
I thought this was like the darkest
lipstick ever and now that I have all
these other dark lipsticks I'm like it
that is not even dark at all so this is
dark but it's very wearable yeah at
least I think so i think it's very
wearable now this one is my favorite i
think this is so gorge for fall and
winter in it literally i feel like i
don't know makes you feel like a big sin
when you wear it's just so sexy i love
it and it's called diva and this is a a
matte finish but for a matte finishes is
very creamy at least that's what I think
but it goes on very well
um and it's just so great I love a shade
a lot now if you don't want to splurge
on like any of the MAC lipsticks that
are really dark you can try out this one
it is the Jordana lipstick and this is
called eggplant I love this lipstick too
is absolutely stunning um this one's
actually a really good dupe for like
dark side by Matt but that's eggplant
right there it's gorgeous it's creamy it
lasts all day and I mean don't knock
these Jordana lipsticks even though the
packaging is ugly this one is so good I
want to try out different ones I'm gonna
have to see if they have any other dark
lipsticks but i like it it's really nice
and it says that it's matt it is matt
but again like diva it is pretty creamy
then for liners I pret to mention this
um this is the NARS larger-than-life
eyeliner let me tell you guys I love
this eyeliner but I'm such a dumbass
because I thought it was a pencil liner
so I kept trying to wind it up and it's
a retractable liner so just check out my
ugly ugly liner right here so if you get
this liner it is retractable don't be a
DA like me and trying to sharpen it
because now I'm scared to poke my eye
with this thing but it's a great eye
liner it lasts all day and it doesn't
smudge on me which is what I love so I
really have been enjoying this eyeliner
a lot so good back to lips we have this
night month lip liner from Mac and this
is a beautiful deep deep purple shade
that's it right there right there where
is it right there so there it is it's so
pretty highly recommended it's like oh
so beautiful and then I've also been
living this NYX liner in deep purple
this one's great to pair with rebel
because they look so similar um let's
see so this one's the NYX lip liner and
then right below it right here is rebel
so they just go so well together love i
love darker lipsticks and like i said
all things some videos below i think i
wanted to show you guys shoes I know
shoes really isn't something I always
clewd in a video but i have been loving
these shoes so first off we're going to
start out with these i got in self
hautelook so they're not on there
anymore I do apologize but they're just
like wedged little ankle booties I guess
well not ankle booties are a little bit
higher but they're just little wedge
booties they literally go with
everything I love them they're paying a
good on though like seriously text me
forever to get them on and off but once
they're on they're so cute I showed
these on my blog a few times and I just
I'm wearing a lot right back
really excuse that noise they're
annoying okay so next I want to show you
guys these these are wedge sneakers i
also got these awful hautelook and i
wasn't sure how would like wedge
sneakers I didn't try them out till this
year but oh my gosh I think these are so
cute and I just love the wedge they're
not too tall and it looked really cute
right I don't know I really liked him a
lot last pair just like a pair of
sneakers but these are from forever 21 I
love these two like edged out an outfit
and kind of make it a little bit less
girly kind of more just I don't know
very edgy and a lot of my stuff is black
a lot of you've noticed in the
background a lot of my shoes are black
and that's because they go with
everything and I wear them the most but
these are what they look like they're so
cute they have little studs in the back
as well and I just enjoy these like
they're so freaking cute they have a
zipper on the sides and those are just
the shoes that i have been loving so
that is it for this video also for fif I
will be updating you guys in another
