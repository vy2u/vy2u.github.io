my favorites video and I know this is
going up pretty early but I really
wanted to kind of film it get it out of
the way since I know what I've been
loving this month and I just want to
show you guys because I have a few other
videos I want to start filming so I feel
like I'm gonna get busy and kind of
forget about it and I love doing monthly
favorites so I didn't want to like not
do one but yeah we're just gonna go
ahead and get started and have a lot of
lip products this month because as you
can tell from like my past few videos
I've just been loving them really
quickly I wanna let you guys know that
it will have all these products as long
as I can find them on website I'll have
them linked on my Levante page so you
can check them out and what's really
cool about that site is instead of like
it's kind of like Pinterest but you can
buy the stuff that you see instead of
like seeing it clicking on it and it
leads you to another world
so I really do like LaVon Christy I
found out about it through YouTube as
well and I think it's really cool so if
you're interested I will have most of
these products linked democracy so you
can just go there do a drive linked and
buy it if you are interested in it okay
so the first thing I want to talk to you
guys about is blush and the first pledge
I've been using a lot this month is
Melba Melba is like a gorgeous color and
I really feel like it goes with
everything you can't go wrong with this
color if you've never bought a blush it
back before I feel like this will be a
great blush to buy because it just it
goes with so much like literally it's
just one of those colors as beautiful no
matter what and another one is from the
RiRi collection or the Rihanna whatever
this one's called bad girls on good this
is like the main thing I was really
excited to get and then I wanted from
the collection and this color is
stunning it is so pigmented and the
color is very different from anything I
have in my collection it's like a peachy
bronze I don't know it is so pretty
though I love this blush like I said
it's a very very pigmented it's a satin
blush and I'm super happy I was able to
pick that up because I know dealing with
that collection when it came out it was
such a pain this way to really quickly
want to shout out my two favorite
bronzers for the month I've been using
my Bobbi Brown bronzer in golden light
I've been using it so much
I can't find this on so forth website
only find it in store so I don't know if
they have it as a different name on the
Sephora website I don't know but I get
mine in store and then another one I've
been contouring with and using to use as
my nose contour as well it's of course
the benefit hoola I bring this out every
few months and you guys always see it in
my favorites video because it's just I
don't know like I forget about it and
then I go back to it and I'm just like
yeah I don't know I really loved it for
my nose contour for the month I had to
mention this brush it's the Mac 163
brush and this is really nice I've been
really really enjoying it to contour my
nose it's really easy to work with I was
taking this brush from Mac the to12 was
just a really thin flat brush I was
using that to line my nose and then
blend it out but it just was so tedious
and this is so fluffy like I put it on
my nose blending out just a little bit
and I'm good to go so I love this it's
kind of similar to that NARS brush but
it's really really dense I actually
ordered the norms brush like forever ago
but I didn't know it was on back order
because I don't think they're selling it
online anymore
but mine's been on backorder for like
ever now so but when it comes in I will
compare the two and see which one I like
better is this brow gel it's the on
estancia of Beverly Hills brow gel and
brunette and I love this it's so good it
holds your brows down amazingly and I
really like the color if I feel like I
went a little too dark with the brow Wiz
then I just put this over top and it
really lightens up the brow it makes it
look a lot more natural so I like this a
lot it's a really great brow gel for
powder I have been loving my Mac prep
and prime trans wait what is it
transparent finishing powder and this is
very nice I I don't know I don't know if
I can say if I like it more than the
makeup for everyone yet but I've been
using it a lot and a lot more than the
NORs powder that I bought and it just
creates a nice smooth finish to the skin
and it just looks really gorgeous and
never powdery so I do like this product
a lot and then for I shout out we have
this makeup geek eyeshadow in creme
brulee this is like freaking phenomenal
I love this eyeshadow you guys I use it
all the time now I
never touch soft brown by mask anymore
like this one is my go-to it's cheaper
than the Mac ones and it's a lot more
pigmented they blend out beautifully I
just oh I love love love this color this
stunning you guys I'm not even joking
moving on to the biggest part of this
favorites video it is lip products and I
really quickly want to talk to you about
nudes these two I mentioned before but I
just want to give them a quick shout out
this is a Fergie daily lipstick from Wet
n Wild and it's just a nude I have it on
today it's so pretty it doesn't look too
nude it's just a nice nude shade so love
that oh and also I'm gonna mention the
NYX butter balls and creme brulee I
talked about this one a lot but I
actually didn't notice the smell until
this month
it smells like skittles and it smells
delicious so I love this it's a really
pretty shade and I do have both of those
on my lips today another one I've been
using a lot this month is Urban Decay's
lipstick in native I have native and
naked to my negatives just to just been
my go-to it's such a pretty color and I
didn't think I would like this because
of how pink it is but this paired with
the NYX lip gloss
I just really enjoy it it's a great kind
of nude pink lip and the packaging of
these is just so cute I love these Urban
Decay lipsticks now moving on to that
darker side of things you guys not gonna
mention this I can't love it too from
Mac of course I love rebel I have a few
videos featuring this one so I will link
those down below but rebels just a
gorgeous kind of berry color I think
people are a lot more intimidated by
this I know when I first started wearing
this dark lipstick I thought this was
like the darkest lipstick ever and now
that I have all these other dark
lipsticks I'm like that is not even dark
at all so this is dark but it's very
wearable yeah at least I think so I
think it's very wearable now this one is
my favorite I think this is so Gorge for
fall and winter in it literally I feel
like I don't know it makes you feel like
a big sin when you wear it's just so
sexy I love it and this is called diva
and this is a a matte finish but for a
matte finishes is very creamy and
that's what I think but it goes on very
well and it's just so pretty I love a
shade a lot now if you don't want to
splurge on like any of the MAC lipsticks
that are really dark you can try out
this one it is the Jordana lipstick and
this is called eggplant I love this
lipstick too is absolutely stunning um
this one's actually a really good dupe
for like darkside by Matt but that's
eggplant right there it's gorgeous
it's creamy it lasts all day and I mean
don't knock these Jordana lipsticks even
though the packaging is ugly this one is
so good I want to try out different ones
I'm gonna have to see if they have any
other dark lipsticks but I like it it's
really nice and it says that it's matte
it is matte but again like diva it is
pretty creamy then for liners I've heard
you mention this um this is the NARS
larger-than-life eyeliner let me tell
you guys I love this eyeliner but I'm
such a dumbass because I thought it was
a pencil liner so I kept trying to wind
it up and it's a retractable liner so
just check out my ugly ugly liner right
here so if you get this liner it is
retractable don't be a DA like me and
trying to sharpen it because now I'm
scared to poke my eye with this thing
but it's a great eye liner it lasts all
day and it doesn't smudge on me which is
what I love so I really have been
enjoying this eyeliner a lot so good
back to lips we have this a night mouth
lip liner from Mac and this is a
beautiful deep deep purple shade that's
it right there right there where's it at
right there so there it is it's so
pretty
highly recommended it's like oh so
beautiful and then I've also been loving
this NYX liner in deep purple this one's
great to pair with rebel because they
look so similar um let's see so this
one's the NYX lip liner and then right
below it right here is rebel so they
just go so well together love I love
darker lipsticks and like I said I'll
link some videos below I think I wanted
to show you guys shoes I know shoes
really
something I always include in a video
but I have been loving these shoes so
first off we're going to start out with
these I got in self hautelook so they're
not on there anymore I do apologize but
they're just like wedged little ankle
booties I guess well not ankle booties
they're a little bit higher but they're
just little wedge booties they literally
go with everything I love them they're a
pain to get on though like seriously it
takes me forever to get them on and off
but once they're on they're so cute
I showed these on my blog a few times
and I just I'm wearing a lot right
really excuse annoys they're annoying
okay so next I want to show you guys
these these are wedge sneakers I also
got these on the boat look and I wasn't
sure how would like white sneakers I
didn't try them out till this year but
oh my gosh I think these are so cute and
I just love the wedge they're not too
tall and it looked really cute right I
don't know I really liked him a lot the
last pair just like a pair of sneakers
but these are from forever 21
I love these two like edge out an outfit
and kind of make it a little bit less
girly kind of more just Elmo very edgy
and a lot of my stuff is black a lot of
you've noticed in the background a lot
of my shoes are black and that's because
they go with everything and I wear them
the most but these are what they look
like they're so cute they have little
studs in the back as well and I just
enjoy these like they're so freakin cute
they have a zipper on the sides and
those are just the shoes that I have
been loving so that is it for this video
also for FIF I will be updating you guys
in another video I know I said I wasn't
include them with my favorites video but
I've decided for this month I am going
to make a separate video on it since I
am doing this so early so yeah I hope
