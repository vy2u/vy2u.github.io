hey guys so today's video was a little
bit different but highly important and
it is going to be my traveling tips
essentials and I'm also going to show
you guys some hacks in here that you
have to try because I guarantee you you
probably have these around your house
and you're going to want to do them so
what we're going to try and avoid is
this suitcase right here because nobody
likes this suitcase but let's be real
yeah it ends up happening at some point
for us so I'm going to share with you
guys how I pack make things a little bit
easier and I am also partnering with u
by Kotex for this video because if you
are a woman more than likely once a
month
mother nature comes knocking at your
door and half the time I mean if you're
traveling a lot it's usually when you're
traveling it really sucks and if you're
not prepared then you're in some serious
hot water and we do not want any
accidents or anything like that we're
going to save the undies and I'm going
to tell you guys about this which is
obviously one of my essentials because
it's a must-have like you have to have
this so yeah if you guys want to see my
hacks tips tricks essentials all of that
then just keep watching okay so these
are the essentials that I tend to leave
but they are the most important so I'm
here to remind you first is a Colgate
toothpaste actually any toothpaste that
you prefer this is just the one that I
use all the time also a brush cleanser I
always forget this but it's good to have
because you gotta clean your brushes at
some point now this is a must-have for
all my women out there and that is
feminine products and I love these by
UAI Kotex these are the u by Kotex
security ultra thin pads and these
feature a 3d capture pore which has a
one-of-a-kind center that locks away
wetness it helps stops leaks which we
all do not want to happen especially if
we're wearing white shorts and it has a
new expression dry cover that means it
has crazy fast absorption and it's
amazing you can also get a free sample
at u by Kotex com so if you're
interested I will leave it down below so
you could try them out and see how
amazing they are
and then you also can't forget makeup
remover in dry shampoo I'm telling you
every time I get off a plane I'm usually
going to a supermarket to get these
things and then also a travel perfume is
a must-have I don't like to bring full
bottles so I always buy these little
ones and then last will not last but not
least but the most important thing is
chargers don't forget your chargers and
the one thing I always always forget
PJ's
don't forget the PJs girls I'm telling
you don't forget them I always forget
these I don't know why moving onto some
hacks for traveling this first one is a
q-tip holder so all you gotta do is take
whatever kind of pill bottle you have it
can be empty whatever you've used up and
you just want to make sure you kind of
clean it out first and then we're gonna
take some washi tape and we're just
going to cover it in washi tape and make
it look nice and pretty so I did go over
a couple times so I had probably like
two wrap arounds of this on each section
and I did do three sections to cover
this whole bottle and then I did also
cover the lid of this bottle and I
absolutely love the way that this looks
I think it's so cute I mean you can use
this for bobby pins q-tips anything you
want it's just gonna look extra cute you
know what I mean so I have to love this
especially for q-tips because if you
have them in a baggie sometimes they can
kind of get all roughed up and look
gross but this way they stay compact and
all put together and I just I love this
hack I think it's so cute
okay so this next hack is a simple one
but I really really love it and all
you're gonna do is take one of these
like binder clips I don't know if that's
what you call them I think that's what
they're called I don't know it's been a
while since I've been in school so we're
just going to take one and we're gonna
put this over the blade of our razor and
this is just going to help protect the
blade and also protect your hands just
in case you're like digging for it or
something you're not going to get cut by
it so I love this really cute then if
you're using these travel sized bottles
and you get a nervous that your eye
makeup remover or your shampoo or
conditioner is going to leak you could
take a piece of plastic shopping bag
just rip it off so rip to my target bag
and then you just want to tie the top on
it with it on and I promise you I was
squeezing this bottle like crazy and
none of the water came out so this is a
really good hack if you're super
paranoid and think it's going to leak
this will help it from getting all over
your clothes
then for makeup I'm going to take a
couple cotton rounds and I'm going to
put these into the compacts just to make
sure that they don't crack and shatter
so the cotton pads really help create a
nice barrier for them and really make it
nice and cushioned so right here I was
actually banging them together really
hard and nothing happened
not a single crack nothing else for
curling iron so you're just going to
take this oven mitt and I got this from
Target I think it was like four bucks
I've had this though and I'm just gonna
put my curling iron in the little sleeve
and then folded up like a taco and wrap
the cord around it and this is really
great because first off it keeps it nice
and protected if it is a little hot and
then you can also use this side right
here to lay your curling iron on in like
your hotel room or whatever just make
sure it doesn't burn anything the last
one is we're going to use one of these
clips again and we're going to use it to
hold our headphones in place and make
sure our cord doesn't get tangled up so
you want to let one of the little parts
down and just wrap the cord around it
and then you're going to bring them
together and then take the end of the
headphones and put them through the two
little holes and you're good to go and I
promise you they stay like this for so
long
I love it because once you put the end
of the headphones through it like locks
it in place so I love this so much
because my Beats headphones get so
tangled up
now on to some of my packing tips some
of these are well known but I still
really recommend them so the first one
is rolling your clothes instead of
folding them you would be so surprised
at how much room you would have if you
just rolled all of your clothes it
doesn't wrinkle them or anything like
that it just creates so much more space
and I feel like it makes your suitcase
look so much more presentable and pretty
I don't know but you can do this with
anything you can do it with shorts pants
tops dresses absolutely anything your
heart desires and actually want to wear
now for bras what I like to do is kind
of cut them over each other so like put
one cup on top of another and put the
straps underneath and I like this
technique for if you're doing multiple
bra so you never know how many bronzer
could need on the trip but if you are
doing multiple ones you can do this and
it saves up some room or you can also do
it with fading suits so then this little
pouch actually take with me as like a
carry-on so I keep my must-haves if my
luggage were to get lost I still have
these and of course if I were to start
my monthly mother nature horribleness I
have some feminine products with me at
all times I usually pack extra as well
just in case because you never know and
then all you gotta do is put everything
in your suitcase and then you are all
set for your trip so I hope some of
these tips and hacks helped you guys if
it did please give it a thumbs up and
let me know in the comments what are
some hacks that you have because I love
finding new hacks I think they're so fun
so thank you guys again so much for
watching and I will see you all in my
next video bye
