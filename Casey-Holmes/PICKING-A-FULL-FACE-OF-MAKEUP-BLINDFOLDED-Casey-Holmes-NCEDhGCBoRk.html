with picking out all the products that
I'm going to use for my blindfolded
makeup challenge and before I start I
want to say I've organized all of this
I've had it organized like this for a
while now and I feel like I'm gonna nail
it but we will see everything is labeled
pretty easy to you know get to and it's
been like this for a while so I have my
flying fold and I'm just gonna pick out
a full face and I have to do my complete
face so that only thing that might be
hard as I did just self tan before this
and it's a little bit more red so I'm
trying out a new one and now you have
your duck yeah help mommy yeah we're
just gonna go and get started I have my
buggy right here that I use for like
everything it's so busted but it works
so well you know he'll time that yeah do
you see uh yeah you might want to touch
just that right there oh my lord the
only thing I'm super nervous about is um
this my what is this my yeah I told you
I would start touching things and then I
would blank I'm nervous about the
eyeliners and mascaras but we're just
gonna cuz there's so many okay this is
definitely benefit so I hope I don't get
a colored liner this smells like a lip
liner okay I'm looking for a specific
liner lip liquid liner looking for that
makeup for everyone because did I drop
something maybe dad make it in my buggy
maybe nope that was almost improper
okay Jose I'm looking for a makeup for
everyone because it has a certain shape
now you got three things in your buggy
three is that you're only supposed to
have two at this point so you need to
take something out okay this is mascara
I got to keep that I don't know what
okay now I need to find this freak you
make up forever little liner so I can
move on
now we're getting to the nitty-gritty
where you guys know your colors and I
don't know what goes I just know
packaging okay these are the same thing
so bronzers and they go into flushes so
there should be blush palettes that
doesn't feel like a question ah see I
haven't even gotten used to clutter
these yet so maybe good for whatever I
do
he's definitely drugstore highlighters
so let's get it on and pop it over this
one
let me able to close this drawer I think
I'm snooping through it is n weird that
I'm feeling a little dizzy because I
have my eyes closed too and I guess cuz
I'm moving around so much okay hold on
trust me I've let you down
what did you hear that hole is that
probably next door okay false lashes I
have some over here I know I have style
I'm gonna try what is it I don't know
that was armpit maybe I'll pick one
thing for eyes to these two for I should
say are new so I'll pick something from
primer foundation concealer Daisy are
you helping me
hey hey Oliver wait you're gonna try
this last thing you just put in yeah all
right you better primer foundation
concealer did it all righty
back to the that was your yeah should
have gone one drug one drawer down to be
in high-end blushes but you did pick
when you went through your new drawer
makeup you went and got this blush
palette I kind of want to get into the
trend of like scarves like putting
scarfs in your hair like as a hairpiece
but can I can I pull this off that's uh
no we're gonna insert with eyes I'm just
gonna kind of look through I knew oh
crap this isn't the one that I thought
it was I thought this was the one with
the highlighters oh well but still a
good brand oops
so we'll probably like it
I was hoping I'd get a nude okay anyways
we're gonna get started because I'll be
here forever if I go through talking
about what I pick gonna take these
Smashbox photo-finish lip primer and
we're gonna prime first I have this
product in my hand like every day so we
actually have the Chloe Morello ciate
pretty fun and fearless palette I think
this is like one of her newest ones with
them play with it too too much to be
honest with you so I'm excited to try
this out today especially with this
chrome paint I'm interested to see how
I'm gonna make that work and the first
shade I'm going to use is my tribe which
is right here and I'm gonna put this all
over my lid to set that primer okay so
I'm just gonna okay now I'm gonna do is
take this morphe brush and the shade
unconditional which is right here and
put this into my crease I actually want
Davis to do a video of me again this
week rating my hauls all the clothes
that I bought so y'all stay tuned for
that because I'm really excited about it
and then I also want to do a morning
routine I know no one does morning
routines are like night routines anymore
but I feel like you guys are the same as
me and like loved those old school
videos just so you guys can see what I
do you know and we use that same brush
and going with on a fire which is right
above it or right beside it a little bit
deeper this in the outer V and I'm not
gonna go above that first shade that we
use so we are going a little bit on the
actual lid with this but this is the
Tarte chrome paint shadow pots and they
had a bunch of different shades of these
I got a lot of these when I was in New
York meeting with them that's the color
right there it's really really pretty
and pigmented I'm gonna do is take flirt
this one right here so I'm gonna put
this in the outer wow it's painted this
in the outer V and go a little bit into
the crease so really blending it in here
I like this purple a lot it's so pretty
it's like not too intense also if you
guys don't follow me on Twitter or
Instagram you definitely should I'm
on Instagram stories quite a bit now
instead of snapchat stories because I
didn't like the snapchat update and I
still don't
I'm on Instagram stories more now but I
was looking for a drink and I got your
suggestions off of Twitter like from
Starbucks and I ended up going with the
stub strawberry refresher
but with lemonade come here honey
do you like your refresher okay.i
refresher need you get you got to come
over here into the mic can hear you
I got the cool lime refresher from
Starbucks
hey guys Davis here today welcome to my
version of KC's makeup it's funny
because I'm talking but you're in the
screen mmm-hmm
there it is this is my new palette Oh
what I like to do here is really brush
it on you know don't get a on the tape
because we need that for later do we
will take it off though
I mean Kay so you're gonna start a pas
de do a podcast yes but Davis got a cool
line refresher with lemonade and I'm
getting the strawberry acai e refresher
acai the girl that Rosie I think so I
think heads too big for this Rosie the
Riveter she's a bass
badass okay so I'm gonna take the Tarte
chrome paint and try to get this on my
brush it's just so crumbly you know like
I just need this to depressed really bad
maybe I could present myself can put
this all over make this one like kind of
the star of the show I love these colors
together like the purple and this so
pretty
I should have carved out my lid it's
okay it's okay oh also davis and i just
got finished watching lost in space we
started it yesterday and we're already
done with it and it's pretty good at
first i was like not feeling it because
the story line was kind of just like all
over the place and I wanted to know
certain things before they got lost in
space and it's one of those things where
they go back and forth like with the
past and the present but it was actually
pretty dang good semi frustrating
because of one character and I just
wanted her to let go away but it was
good if you guys have seen it let us
know and also let me know in the
comments what your favorite Netflix show
is right now like what are you Benjamin
this isn't on Netflix that I'm still
binging a Riverdale like I love it
wasn't a big fan of the musical I'll be
honest but I am still a fan of the show
whoo I can use my primer water that I
pull to make this just a bit more
intense I'm gonna try that and just see
how it works so glad that voice overs
aren't as big as I used to be like it
used to be the thing to have the
shortest videos ever voiceovers and now
people love it when you talk through
videos which I've always loved that I
just never did it that much because
people would always say like how much
shorter videos and you know people would
recommend shorter videos from YouTube in
general because the audience retention
which is like how long people actually
watch your videos for but now it's like
people encourage you to do longer videos
and all of that which I'm all for like
that primer water did intensify that oh
I didn't get a liquid liner dang it I
got distracted because I was on eyeliner
for so long that I didn't but I got a
green eyeliner that like literally
almost matches us believe it or not
how prettier those together and don't
mind I just literally like self-tanner
we have to redo it I know maybe I'll
just line it and be done yeah I'm going
to curl my lashes apply mascara which I
did pick the benefit roller lash this is
not hard to miss like this handle I'm
gonna drop these lashes glue them to my
eyes and they'll be back and we'll move
on to the face okay guys so I have my
lashes on now we're gonna move on to
foundation actually primer so I'm going
to use my primer water of course I know
what this feels like and douse my face
in it I really like this - it's just a
lavender facial mist you can use this
pretty much any time it just smells
really good not gonna spray it now cuz I
didn't pick it out but I really really
like this and then also just really
quickly I tried out this Clinique fit
workout makeup and this is like a full
coverage moisturizer this is intense but
I'll talk about that with you guys in a
little bit I'm also going to take the
tatcha primer that I picked out - this
is another obvious one that I knew what
it was by feeling it so I'm just gonna
put this all over I do really like this
primer next up we'll do a foundation I
have the hood of beauty in 310 I don't
know if this shade will be perfect for
me but I do love this foundation this is
her faux filter high coverage foundation
just gonna put this on the back of a
pallet so I don't have to put on my hand
it's a little bit more yellow usually my
self tan comes out a little bit more
yellow once it's dried and everything
but this other self tanner
I've been trying is more red especially
when it first goes on so it's just not
gonna match today monthly favorites for
this month is gonna be so good but I
think I'm gonna upload it next week
because I want to put some other videos
in between I just did one not too long
ago and since I've been out of town I
wasn't able to post this week so I want
to post other or I should say last week
I just want to post some other content
before I put up another favorites video
because they're just
a little too close together for my
liking even though they like my favorite
videos I could do literally a full
month's worth of favorites and hits it
like hits and misses but I can't do that
okay so we are blended out looks so good
I love this foundation so nice oh I did
get the Tarte shaped tape as well as the
flower beady concealer I love both of
these and they're pretty obvious but the
way they feel so this is the light
illusion a full coverage concealer in
light medium from flower actually I
meant to put Tarte right there uh-huh
I usually do Tarte like here what shade
is this light neutral loose is too light
but you know so I put Tarte in the
darkest parts of my eyes and then I put
another concealer like this flower
beetle over I'll also use the flower
Beauty one on its own oh this is dark
light medium yeah I think I use I think
I use the shade light to really
highlight the face Davis and I have a
military ball this month I have no idea
what I'm gonna wear
having a looked and I really should
start looking like right now
but maybe I'll do like a get ready with
me for that would you guys enjoy that
because I am excited I love getting like
super dressed up
I just took away my outer-v right oh I'm
kind of like in the bandana now then I
got makeup on I was just in Georgia this
past week and it was such a tease
because they got such great weather and
like I was in short sleeves and like I
had first landed with a North Face cuz
it was cold where I was and I landed
with a North Face got two rosy days and
literally you guys I was sweaty so for
powder I do have the new Marc Jacobs
invisible finish line perfecting coconut
setting powder this is new from them I
literally just opened it up yesterday I
think it was um it has like a little net
in here and it has like a little tint to
it too which I love I'm going to apply
this with my sponge underneath my eyes
and all over my face so I just opened
this yesterday and put it back in my
drawer so I'm
not sure how I feel about it just yet
but so far it looks pretty good yeah it
looks pretty nice I like this neck so
convenient for traveling but I need my
sponge to get some product okay I'm also
going to take my little Smashbox brush
and dip into this net and I'm going to
get right underneath that lower lash
line just to really pull in this out and
in the inner corner
I forgot this rude cosmetics primer
spray matte finish say we'll try it over
makeup too just to see you know because
it says it has a matte finish I didn't
get a bronzer one of my favorite things
in makeup so we'll just use this palette
this is the profusion Pro contour I need
to go to Target and see if I can find
this brand there because I love the
books that I have I'm going to show you
guys a while ago that has like the
brushes highlighters and contour shades
so I haven't really used this one much
but I'm gonna take this color right here
and try to bronze it's probably gonna be
way too dark but we're just gonna we're
just gonna tap a little bit and very
lightly bronze the skin Who am I bronzer
is like my favorite part of makeup okay
this is working though and I'm going to
get up another thing I want to do is
actually take this yellow shade right
here and really brighten up this
under-eye so I'm gonna use this a four
brush and that's super light yellow and
see if I can brighten up my eyes with
woo Wow
give it oh no but it kind of looks like
cakey definitely brightened but I don't
know if I love that texture of it I'm
also gonna take this Mac brush and
contour with this shade right here's a
little bit more ashy and we're just
going to sculpt out these cheeks
okay I'm gonna take that yellow one and
my sponge and I'm actually gonna carve
out my contour just so it's nice and
sharp we're gonna like kind of bake
there for a little bit just so looks
nice intense Wow oh no I did get a
bronzer I got the Anasazi one I thought
this was a blush so I'm gonna add this
because I have to use everything I have
to use everything in the bin so I'm
gonna use just a little bit of this on
my cheeks to give a little bit more of a
bronze glow just take Sonia Kashuk brush
this bronzer much better kinda looks
like a nice blush for me right now
we have two blushes we have the essence
blush play sculpting blush palette I
really do like this palette it's nice
and then I also pick a new Kevin a Kwan
neo blush these look really pretty I
just got them in over the weekend this
one's in sunset only thing is that these
do have a little bit of a shimmer but
wow really use this brush with this
blush because this blush looks intense
this brush will pick up a light amount
so actually it's a Smashbox buildable
cheek brush just gonna swirl it in there
a lot of powder buff it on the cheeks
there okay and I'm gonna take just a
teeny bit of this one I'm gonna mix
these two together school this is an
Ecotools brush I know my I'm sorry this
is an Elizabeth Scott brush I got it in
a kit from TJ Maxx and actually okay
these are blending out oh all right all
righty who's gonna say decent but seeing
all righty okay now I'm gonna take the
thin T Beauty kilowatt highlighters in
muscle a baby I don't really use these
much because I feel like they emphasize
my texture a little too much they are
pretty this is what it looks like I
can't believe I didn't realize that this
was it like
I guess cuz I haven't really used it so
much I'm gonna use my honest hacia brush
I'm just gonna mix the two actually no I
used to do this one down my cheek a
little bit more because it's not as
shimmery so I'm gonna take this down
just a bit so it gives like a subtle
glow then I'm gonna take the other one
and build it up okay that looks pretty
but I also have the anasazi a glow kit
that I chose I really should not have
picked two things is the glow kit in
that glow and I'm just gonna take I
think I guess a little bit of bubbly and
just we don't need any more than
highlight and we're gonna move on to
brows so the two brow products that I
picked out where they benefit precisely
my brow in number three and then you
could treat climatic and medium wow I
picked two good colors right cuz three
is blonde isn't it oh no three is kind
of darker too let's close so actually
what I'm gonna do is use the crease one
on the outer half of my eyebrow because
I know it works there but I can't
remember how dark the benefit one is so
we'll just do that one in a moment
all right so we're just gonna keep them
as is because they are pretty dark I'm
gonna go in with this arch brow
volumizing fiber gel from hourglass in
the shade blonde which should lighten
these up a bit this one just act like
little highlights which I also enjoy
back in the Chloe ciate palette the
first thing I'm gonna take that eyeliner
that I pick so I'm just gonna put this
on my waterline okay now I'm gonna take
my Sigma e 15 and go in with ooh
going with daydream and push that ripe
against that lower lash line and before
I go in with a darker shade to blend
that out I'm gonna take my pencil brush
I'm gonna take a really light shade I
think I'm gonna go in with dainty so I'm
gonna put dainty in the palette in my
inner corner
and then I'm gonna take it underneath my
brow as well okay and I'm gonna take
someone benefit roller lash and coat the
top lashes to get some of that powder
off and then I'm gonna take the other
lash product that I chose which is the
volume power essence instant volume
boost mascara so I'm gonna take this one
and put it on my lower lashes and now
I'm gonna go on to lips so I did pick
this bite Beauty lip crayon in zero
three six she looks like it's quite a
bit of love good color and then the lip
color that I chose is a Smashbox liquid
lip in babe alert which I do love this
shade but just not for this look so
we're just gonna put it on oh it's a
little dry I think mine's old yeah much
hafsat after this video so what I'm
gonna do is just put this on first then
I'm gonna take a little bit of the
flower Beauty concealer in light medium
on the back of my hand and I'm gonna use
my finger to cut that all over the
center and then spread it out to lighten
it up a bit
last thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try
out this rude cosmetics makeup primer
spray it says long-lasting and hydrating
I believe it's just used before and
spreads all over
that's pretty even that's nice
so this is my final look with all
products that I picked out blindfolded I
really like it like you guys know I know
my products so well so I figured out do
pretty good at this challenge like
picking out some of my favorite products
um it was cool to dip into some other
products as well like in the Tarte
chrome paint shadow pots this is really
really pretty as well as clothes palette
with ciate this is so so nice I think
I'm gonna like this Kevyn Aucoin blush
but we will definitely see there's
everything for this video I really hope
