today we're trying something different
we're trying something I have been dying
to get my hands on and it finally came
in the mail and it is the pore vacuum
blackhead sucker upper I know you guys
have seen this everywhere I have seen
this everywhere and I've been so curious
to see if it works because I get really
bad blackheads like right in here on my
nose and it's just looking for something
easy you know I don't always have time
to go do the facial sometimes I don't
want to spend money on facial even
though I know they're worth it another
worth it but sometimes you just want to
cure some of those blackheads at home
and sometimes poor strips just aren't
enough so I figured I would test this
out if you want to see me try out this
amazing little hopefully amazing pore
vacuum then keep watching and don't
forget to subscribe before you leave and
hit that like button and let's just go
ahead and get started so I pulled out
some things just to see like what kind
of battery took in all that and
everything is in Japanese I believe this
big come from Japan so I'm going to take
it this is Japanese I don't know what
any of this is saying no English
directions doctor some of Amazon I
believe it was around 20 something
dollars I'll put the price right here
what was so expensive was the shipping
so it turned out to be like 50 some odd
dollars and yeah it was pretty intense
only thing that human English was a
thank you card saying thank you for
purchasing it does take a double-a
battery I went ahead open that up and
put one in there I have not turned it on
or anything don't know what it sounds
like
how strong it is we're just going to try
it out so this is what the packaging
looks like so we're just going to hop on
into this we're going to see if this
works if it's good and I have nothing on
my face no moisturizer nothing so we can
really suck all those pores and get it
out just going to open it by the way
this is waterproof I just see that
online because I went back on Amazon to
see if there is any directions like in
the description of the product and there
was no directions so I guess it's kind
of like it's self-explanatory
girlfriends just suck your pores out I
don't necessarily know how you would
clean it but maybe I can look something
up on Google and see like how to clean a
pore vacuum so this is what it looks
like it's pretty lightweight I mean the
only thing that's weighting it down is
the battery and we're about to turn it
on
as loud okay so I want you guys to we're
going to get up close here and you can
kind of see like right in here so I get
really bad pores it's just so gross
oh my god
just actually doing anything okay
there's one so there's like a little bit
coming out there's like three I would
say see if you guys can see that I don't
think you'll be able to there's like
three little specks in there
I mean it's working for some of them but
what a half-filled uh okay so I'm gonna
leave it at that it digging some of my I
don't know what you call it bad kids I
don't I don't know
these are blackheads it doesn't look
like it but I dig it some stuff out of
my nose I think you have to apply more
pressure like when you're vacuuming it
like you have to press it up against the
skin really hard and pull to really get
results you kinda have to go over the
same area a few times in my opinion I
would just go get a facial and get them
to remove all your blackheads because
they're really going to get in deep and
it does kind of hurt but I mean it does
get all the blackheads out this is nice
I mean it's convenient but I can't see
myself using this all the time kind of
feel like I could just took that $50 and
went got a really nice deep pore
cleansing facial but this is what it got
out you guys can see it like right there
but it's not like a miracle worker in my
opinion so I would say save your money I
didn't really like it I feel like I just
wasted fifty dollars I know my skin's
burning because obviously I was just
vacuuming the crap out of my pores let
me know you guys thought in the comments
if you've tried this out and have any
tips definitely let me know I thought is
gonna be like my new love I really had
high hopes for it so that kind of sucks
but I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you all in my next one
waking up feeling good breaking up
making oh man oh I'm thinking about
moving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
