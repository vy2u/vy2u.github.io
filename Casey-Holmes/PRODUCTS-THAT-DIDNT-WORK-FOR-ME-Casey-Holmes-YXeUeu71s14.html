be sharing with you products that do not
work for me these are just disappointing
products that I have tried either they
just didn't work for my skin I didn't
like the texture the formula anything
like that so I'm going to be sharing
that with you today I hope you guys
enjoy it don't forget to and subscribe
before you leave and if you want to see
all the products that just didn't work
then let's just go ahead and get started
let's just ignore my nails they're
getting done very soon I didn't have
time before I started pre-filming to get
them done so real quick before we get
started obviously I'm going to say
disclaimer that I feel like everyone
said in this video or these types of
videos and that is something that's the
one for me that doesn't mean it's not
going to work for you there's no need to
get upset if I like something that you
are like obsessed with because a lot of
things just don't work out for us people
things I love might be things that you
hate as well let's not get stressed
about it it's just makeup it'll be okay
the next ten minutes will fly by in
Orland and you'll be like didn't affect
my life at all right this is the first
thing I want to talk about is this
Korres black pine 3d sculpting a firming
and lifting eye cream now I did love the
way this made my under eyes feel but it
burned the absolute teetotal crap out of
my eyes it burned so bad and I tried to
like really make sure I didn't get too
close to my eyes and everything and it
just it it's an eye cream so you got to
get it somewhat close to your eyes but
for some reason I just couldn't make
this work for me it just stunned so bad
and I got so tired of using it next up
is this a makeup revolution a triple
baked bronzer and this one's in the
shade a hot summer of love the main
reason why I don't like this is because
it is so shimmery I am NOT using this as
a bronzer I thought I put this all over
my face you will question me forever
this looks more like a highlighter like
right there that's the true color it's
just too dark for me to use and I'm not
using this as a bronzer that's more of a
highlight if I maybe I could use the
other two shades as a highlighter so
that's the liar to put together which is
nice it's still too deep of a tone for
me to highlight with next up we have
these Jordana sweet cream and matte lip
colors I did not do a video on these I
did a full video on the wet wild liquid
lips like forever ago when they first
came out
absolutely love those but I didn't like
the formula of these very much I like
the wet laws once better these are too
dry they're too thin and they don't wear
all my lips really well they do kind of
have that same like if you tried to
color cosmetics liquid lips the very
first time they came out this is what
they feel like and it smells just like
it too it's like that sweet cream like a
sweet icing on top of a cupcake and I
don't know I just don't like that super
drying feeling for a liquid lips anymore
like my liquid lip has to be comfortable
which is why I've kind of switched out
different liquid lips that I use like I
use the smashbox ones i use the wet-bulb
ones there's just a bunch of different
other options that are not super drying
like these so these are not my favorite
I don't really like them I did buy the
full collection when they first came out
so my loss yes if you do like more of a
drying formula then you might like this
I mean it's a good cheaper alternative
to higher-end one so this is a models
own bronzer I love a lot of models on
products they need to have some great
things that this is in light tan oh one
and they say - gizelle why I don't
really like this it is just way too
orange for me and the formula is really
nice so it's very creamy very very soft
but I like a warm bronzer but this is
just too much you put this on your face
it is going to make you look super super
orange for this to be light tan it kind
of throws me off too because I would not
expect this to be a light tan I'm not a
fan of the color but I do like the
formula so hopefully they come out with
more shades this product is one that
surprised me so much because I love the
other powder from this brand from the
brand flower beauty but I was like I'm
going to try to translucent one because
I love the colored powder and this is
the flower Beauty miracle matte
translucent finishing powder and I think
whatever I used to talk about the powder
that I got from them that has a tint to
it a lot of people thought I was talking
about this one which is a matte powder
because I'm more oily and people kind of
think oh okay she definitely went with a
matte one which I didn't I went with the
ones with the shade I would always use
the shade lo1 but I got this because I
was like this let's see what people are
talking about and they're saying they
don't like it and I tried it out oh my
god
if you want flashback here you go but
when you go to wipe away the powder it
just sticks and you can see where you
applied the powder you can see it in
daylight you can see it in photos this
will flash back really bad as well it
was one of those products that I tried
that once you put it on your face it's
not going to blend out you know what I'm
saying it's a really finely milled
powder but it's just it's a little too
much if you think about it because you
can't work with it you can't blend it
out and you can't put it all over your
face so I was a little disappointed by
this but if you're looking for a great
powder from this brand the tinted ones
lo1 so good to set your under-eye width
next up I have these two primers that I
don't like for the same exact reason we
have the models own a face base a face
primer and then we also have the bronze
pore minimizer jia line I just don't
like these because they have that like
silicone feel they make me more oily
than I should be my makeup kind of
slides around with these products and
they're just not my favorite so that's a
really simple one I feel like with oily
skin it's really really hard to find
like pore minimizing products or even
sometimes mattifying primers that aren't
too silicone II sometimes I find that
that's great when you first apply it and
it mattifies the skin or blurs the
appearance of pores but as you go
throughout the day and your oils start
to mix in with that it just starts to
become a mess and break up and it just
doesn't work I find that these two do
that to me I'm not a big fan of them at
all I think if you have more normal to
dry skin you would like these but if
you're oily I would say these are a path
we now have the Too Faced natural love
palette I've used is just a couple times
and I wasn't impressed with the shades
in here I don't know what it is but
every time I get a new toothpaste
palette I'm just not not inspired I
don't know what look I want to do
because they're all so neutral and the
same and I just I don't know something
about them I'm just not excited about
this was definitely one of those
palettes that I got those like I'm not
really feeling it there's a ton of
shimmer barely any matte shades I found
that I didn't enjoy putting them on I
mean if you love these kind of shades
and you don't have them in your
collection you might like it but I just
feel like the formulas not out state
ending I feel like there's drugstore
eyeshadow that is comparable to this you
could save some cash I love the brand
toothpaste I'll have a bunch of stuff
from them but their eyeshadow palettes
just haven't been wowing me lately and
this is one of those palettes that I
like knew I wasn't going to use very
often I want to give you an example of
this shade at fairytail right here it is
not very pigmented it's mostly just
glitter specks in there and I just don't
like that I mean it's the shades like
this I look forward to to have like a
really good base to it with that shimmer
on top so I can apply it all over my lid
but this shade that I would be most
excited about is basically like a sheer
shadow with glitter in it you know it's
nothing really very special next up I
have this tan luck okay tan Lex I saw
these people on HSN and I was like oh my
God look at this self-tanner these girls
look absolutely amazing and use it in my
life I love self-tanning been doing it
for very long time as you guys know and
this was I thought easy to work with but
I was so streaky and the color just
wasn't there you got to work to get the
color with this product with loving tan
you know you can just go ahead and apply
it sleep on it wake up the morning and
you're nice and tan this one you need to
use a few nights in a row to have a
really deep tan but I find that it's not
consistent it's not very even and it
gives me more of like an orange tone and
like a natural kind of olive tan they
say when you apply this it's normal to
turn red but when I put it on my body
does is like oh you are turning like
beet red like my skin was just so
incredibly red so I don't know why it
does that I mean it's supposed to
supposedly I mean my hands looked awful
my arms and it's one of those things
where it doesn't have a color guard or
anything so you don't know where you're
applying it you're just supposed to
apply this with your lotion and then mix
it all over your body but I always got
streaky always always always and I just
feel like having a color garden so much
easier because that way you can see
where you're putting it okay in the last
product I want to talk about is just
this mask which I think I mentioned this
past month in my hips and mrs. video but
if you didn't watch that I did mention
this mask and I don't really like it I
know it's a more pricey item I do really
love this texture spray it is absolutely
amazing if you want some texture you
don't want something the way
down your hair make your hair feel dirty
this is so good but this product right
here I was relying on this because I was
like oh I could take like a hair mask
with me while I'm traveling I was like
okay I've got a hair mask I'm good I can
wash my hair will be great and it'll be
smooth all that but I put this in my
hair for a soft seat spray it's go like
geez I can show you guys it's just such
a aggressive spin spray that's what it
looks like I even tried spraying it to
my hands and applying it to my hair it
smell really good I tried many different
ways of using it but it just wasn't a
fan I put hair maps from my ear down
because if I put it up towards my roof I
will get super oily and I don't it's
like just defeats the purpose of me
washing my hair so I always keep it away
from my roots I keep it down here so I
would spray all into the bottom ends of
my hair I sprayed into my hands massage
my hair I did exactly what it said leave
it on to three minutes
rinsed out with cold water and it just
made my hair feel plant-like it was so
dry not the way a mask should make your
hair feel so I was a little disappointed
in this I have to say I'm not saying the
brand is that at all obviously I like
other products from them as well as all
the brands I mentioned in this video
this one was just a dud and I would say
save your money on it and buy a
different hair mask okay guys and so
that is it for this video let me know
down below in the comments what some of
your favorite products are if you have
tried an these let me know if you like
them or not as well it's how do you use
them also interested if you have any
alternatives to these products I want to
hear them down below in the comments
thank you guys so much for watching I
will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
