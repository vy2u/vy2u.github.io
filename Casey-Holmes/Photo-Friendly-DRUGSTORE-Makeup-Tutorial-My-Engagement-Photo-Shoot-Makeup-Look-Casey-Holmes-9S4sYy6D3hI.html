going to be doing this makeup look for
you this is a drugstore photo friendly
makeup look that I'm actually going to
be using tomorrow for my engagement
photos this is what I'm going to wear
just because it's a nice glam look but
it's simple and not too overpowering for
photos when I know I'm going to be
taking professional photos and things
like that
I like to go a little bit more neutral
on the eyes and really light here in
inner corner just because I want to make
sure I'm doing a smoky look like this
where I have a winged liner in a smoky
lash line I still want my eyes to look a
little bit more open so having this
lighter inner corner right here and not
dragging my black liner all the way into
the inner corner here really does help
open up the eye so that way when you
take your photos your eyes that look
clothes off and too dramatic you know
what I'm saying so this is the list that
I love and it's beautiful I love the
face makeup it lasts for such a long
time and I makeup does as well
everything that I showed you in this
video I truly love and I think it's a
great product and I highly recommend it
everything is drugstore - my eyeshadow
primer I know you're probably lush
thought it was drugstore I know I just
don't have an eyeshadow primer that
drugstore you guys know I love drugstore
has been doing nothing but drugstore
videos and you know I love it but I have
not found a primer that I'm obsessed
with yet that's great for my oily eyelid
that's one thing that's not in here and
then I ran out of my eye lower lashes
but you can find like Walmart Target
Kohl's have the faux mink lashes are the
best and will give you this effect that
these lashes gave me the integers Lily
lashes that I had laying around that
I've used like four times they're really
pretty but they're not drugstore those
are the only two things that are not
drugstore everything else is and
everything else I really love also I
want to remind you guys this weekend I'm
having my Chicago me up on April 22nd
I'll have all the info down below in the
description Buffy you are in the Chicago
area I would love to meet you and then
the next weekend the 29th I will also
have a meet-up in LA which I have not
announced here on YouTube it's going to
be in LA and it's a really fun one we're
going to be doing like an adoption
center typing at Smashbox Studios we're
going to be partnering with a rescue
group they're going to be bringing in
some pets that we can adopt and I'm so
I'm so excited you're in the LA area if
you're in Chicago
we check the description box down below
to see where my meetups are what time
they are and I hope you guys can come
out I would love to meet every single
one of you so yeah I think that's a lot
to say don't forget to subscribe and
like it if you enjoyed this video so if
you want to see how I got this the
photo-friendly
drugstore makeup look then let's just go
ahead and get started all right so you
guys know drugstore number one tape I
like to use scotch tape I also have the
shadow shields which I do like those as
well the tape is just easy and then it's
just so easy to get that perfect line
and get it right where I want it so like
I said in the beginning this is not a
drugstore primer it's actually by NARS
but honestly I haven't found one from
the drugstore that works for me because
I do have oily eyelid and I'm just going
to do a talk for your tutorial so I hope
you guys do mine so the first palette
for eyeshadow I'm going to use is this
make up a revolution ultra eye contour
and I'm just going to take this shade
right here it's just a nice yellow
vanilla tone and I'm going to put this
all over my lid just to set that primer
and give us a nice space for the rest of
the shadows okay now going in with a
fluffy crease brush and I'm going to
take this shade right here at the end
and I'm going to throw this into my
crease when it comes to me taking photos
I don't like to do a super dramatic look
like something really smoky just because
I feel like it really closes off my eye
and I don't like that so I like to focus
lighter colors here on the inner corner
and there's smoke cleared out just a
little bit on the outer half and then
false lashes and I've done of course
it's up to you with whatever you want to
do but this is the look that I'm going
for for my engagement photos and I'm
taking tomorrow which I'm sure you guys
have heard me talk about a million times
because I'm pre-filming a lot of videos
yeah for my professional photos I'm
getting done tomorrow I want something
that's not too smoky and it doesn't take
away from you know my outfit and
everything like that I also have the
flower Beauty shimmer and shade
eyeshadow palette this one in the shade
golden neutral or gold a natural I'm
sorry and then take this color right
here so I'm going to blend this right
below that first shade we just put on to
add a little extra warmth in there could
of all ages went in with this color
first
I forgot to hit this pallet right beside
me I'm going to take this really cool
brush some more feet in one six five and
I'm going to go in with this deep shade
right here this brush is really great
for control so if you want to do a cut
crease or if you have a specific place
that you want to put darker colors this
is the brush to use because what it is
is it's pretty stiff but you have
complete control over where you can put
that eyes shadow and its really nice and
thin so you can pick it up in your
crease if you wanted to and I just like
to do it like so which is really nice
it's not like a fluffy brush where it's
just going to blend it everywhere it's
just going to go exactly where you want
to put it so I take it a little bit into
the crease this is a really dark color
and we went in with this shade right
here in this flower Beauty palette so
take the same shade and brush that we
just use and blend this out and I
obviously like to stick to neutral when
I do photo shoots or I call them photo
shoots but I'm getting professional
pictures taking I do like to stick to
neutral eye shadows because I don't
necessarily know like I don't even know
right now what outfit I'm going to wear
tomorrow so I just like to wear
something that I know will go with
pretty much anything
this look is really really easy as well
like that's pretty much all we're going
to do on the outer corner because it's
pretty smoky as it is okay so next up
I'm going to use this NYX glitter glue
supposed to be a dupe for the Too Faced
one I actually have not tried this so
we're going to see how it works today Oh
cute just in a little holographic tube
looks exactly the same as the Too Faced
one and then I'm just going to pack this
on the inner corners of my eye okay snow
so far it's not as sticky as a
toothpaste one you might be able to get
away with taking a little bit more time
while applying this and then I'm going
to go in with the first shade right here
this is you really nice light shade I'm
just going to tap this
and then we will blend out those edges
and the reason why I like to put
something like a glitter glue down first
is just to really make sure this
eyeshadow pops and looks really nice on
the eyes you don't have to but I find it
just intensifies the eyeshadow and
really makes it stick so it's up to you
you don't have to it's just what I
prefer I do this even with high-end
products especially if the eyeshadow is
really shimmery or something this just
holds that shimmer on the lid and then
we are going to take that brush that we
have been going back and forth with and
just blend out the edges very very
lightly if you're a bridesmaid or
something and you just want something
simple to do that's going to look great
in photos this is the way to go
flower beauty eye shadow palette is
legit okay so now I'm going to do is I'm
going to add liquid liner and I am going
to do a wing so I love the way winged
liner makes my eyes look so that is what
I'm going to do today I'm going to use
this essence superfine eyeliner pin and
it's waterproof so if your eyes start
watering it's not going to go everywhere
does have a pretty long felt tip I
always use my forehead because it's so
big show your coats products it is a
pretty long spell tip but I find it easy
to work with
it does dry down that which I really
like for photos and everything I like a
nice matte liner because it makes it
look a little bit more clean a lot of
the times to whatever I want to do my
makeup for a shoot is I will just do
liner lashes and just a nice bold lip
just so my eyes still stay nice and open
but if I do want something a little bit
more sexy a little bit more dramatic
this is what I go for so I might use
different products like Natasha is
Ã¡notÃ¡ palette but in this video I just
want to show you that you can achieve
the same exact look with drugstore
makeup so since our lashes are not
drugstore I'm just going to keep going
we're going to go ahead and move on to
space and then what I do brows and stuff
we'll just go ahead and do the lashes as
well so I'm going to prime and what I'm
going to use is this one heck of a blot
primer by step and Glory a lot of you if
you follow me for a while you know I
love this and they also love the
foundation that super Glory has with
this I just think it's amazing I
actually don't have any more of the
foundation I need to get more but I
really love this primer and it really
does help mattify the skin and also
still in your pores so I'm going to take
some of that on my fingers and I'm just
going to put this in my t-zone which is
the area that I get oily where I have
pores and the most texture really don't
put any product on the outer parts of my
face unless I have extra product just to
spread around you like to focus
something like this on my problem areas
none of that primer is set in are going
to go in with our foundation I'm going
to using the wet and wild photo focus
foundation so great foundation looks
amazing on the skin and it wears really
well throughout the day as well love
this and it's made for flash photography
as well if you're looking for something
high-end one thing I would say is
definitely stay away from a sailor don't
wear I've talked about my bad experience
before I love that foundation oh my gosh
when you take a picture at night with it
you look like a crazy person so this
one's the shade desert beige and I'm
also going to put a little bit of golden
beige on as well so this foundation is
medium to full coverage on me it is
really nice and full coverage and I love
it I really like using a sponge with it
as well it just blends out really easy
it does kind of smell like play-doh but
I
that it makes me reminisce on different
things so I don't mind it and this is a
$5.99 foundation so you can't really
beat that beautiful finish doesn't
accentuate poor texture and it covers
really well so if you looking for a new
foundation and you have not checked this
out I highly recommend you do now I'm
going to go in with this Maybelline fit
me concealer in the shade 20 sand I
really like this concealer I use this
for like day to day makeup I know I
don't mention it a lot on my channel but
it is a really great product really
liked it a lot so I'm going to highlight
with it and conceal under my eyes I am
going to blend it pretty far down on my
cheek just to give that highlighted
effect again this concealer is just
awesome kind of reminds me of the Urban
Decay Naked skin just sits on the face
beautifully it's not a full coverage
concealer it's definitely more medium to
full depending on how you build it up
but it is stunning so that looks like
and now we're going to do is set it with
the LA girl Pro HD powder this is in the
shade banana yellow and we're just going
to bake our face with it I think baking
your face is so important I know some
people don't like it and it kind of just
depends on your skin type
I'm very oily and I love it I just find
baking really makes me look a little bit
extra flawless and just really locks
everything into place so that throughout
the day it doesn't move alright so while
that's baking I'm going to go ahead and
put on my lashes I'm just wearing really
lashes I've been wearing these a lot
lately and I'm also going to do my brows
and to do my brows I am using the makeup
revolution brow pomade and blonde which
just showed a lot of times so I'm just
going to go ahead and do those two
off-camera and then I'll be back to
finish up this was for you guys so we've
got our lashes and brows on and now I'm
going to go ahead and just the baked
away and also I know I just put my
lashes on so they probably have some
lash glue showing so I will fix that
after it completely dries so I'm going
to also dust this baking on the rest of
my face just to set absolutely
everything I don't like to bake my whole
entire face I mean I kind of do but I do
like the dust the powder like up towards
my hairline so I could get this little
area that I did not bake and that way
you'll set the foundation and put that
powder to work here's what the base is
looking like so far love it oh then I
get some mascara appearance now we're
going to move on to bronzer I think you
guys know what I'm going to say Oh
Neutrogena Healthy Skin blends bronzer
and 30 Sunkist is one of my all-time
favorite bronzers ever it is just so
beautiful so I'm going to take it on
this large brush right here this is the
mr. right brush from toothpaste and I'm
just going to pack this on tap it off
and then we're just going to bronze the
skin this bronzer just blends so well
and looks so seamless in photos and
video feel like it has them one of the
best colors in the drugstore just for
bronzing all over the skin looks like a
nice tan and it doesn't look too orange
and intense again and we're just
bronzing the skin looks so pretty today
what we're going to do is contour I'm
going to use the sculpt powder out of
these sculpt and glow models own palette
sorry my hair's like everywhere
especially it's clean today so
somebody's in this color right here I
just find that it is so beautiful to
contour with this just gives a really
nice shadow underneath that cheekbone
and this is very easy to blend out as
well so if you feel like you went a
little too heavy you can just blend it
out and you'll be good that's all I do
and then I'm going to go back in with
this mu a stippling brush by the way
this stippling brush is from the
drugstore so if you're interested I got
- easy s yes first about water use it I
definitely go to CVS now I'm going on a
blush I want to go on with something a
little bit deeper than what I normally
go with just because I wanted to show in
photos but I am going to use a lighter
hand with this it is the Palladio herbal
matte blush and this is in the shade
toasted apricot apricot apricot
I love Palladio blushes just because
they're so beautiful on the skin they're
really easy to blend as well and have a
lot of pigmentation with that being said
I'm just going to tap it in a couple
times tap off the excess and just
lightly smile and put it on my cheeks it
just adds a little bit of a rosy tint
you can see the difference there and
then for my photo shoot I'm going to use
my spotlight palette but for today I am
going to use the wet and wild boozy
brunch for this video since it is all
drugstore I'm just going to highlight
with this I'm going to highlight
underneath my brow I'm gonna use that
same shade that we used all over the lid
and just put this right underneath that
brow and then I'm also going to put a
little bit of that shade in the inner
corner to brighten this up as well makes
huge huge difference now I'm going to
use the NYX gel pencil liner this is a
black one and I'm going to use this to
line my upper waterline which I'm not
going to show you guys because I find it
so gross when I look back on footage of
me doing this so all you want to do is
line this upper waterline right here
that way it's just nice and deep and
black at the lash line it really makes
your lashes look a little bit more full
and it really like pulls the makeup lips
together so I love doing this I always
do it even if I'm not wearing false
lashes I'll still do it just so my
lashes look a little bit more full and
intense and then I'm going to take this
and I'm going to put this on my
waterline but I'm not going to go all
the way to the inner corner I'm just
going to keep it out here I just put it
more on the outer half into about midway
on my eye just so that this area stays a
little bit more nice and open it looks a
bit more awake in photos and then it is
time to do the lower lashes so I am
going to use the flower Beauty palette
again and going with that really deep
Brown that we use just going to press
this up against that lower lashes the
lower lashes and again take it a little
over halfway just so it blends nicely
I'm going to use this shade right here
and a pencil brush we're just going to
lightly blend these edges just so it
looks nice and smoky and then I'm taking
this color all the way in here so this
is still more of a smoky look for photos
but it doesn't completely close off your
eyes in my opinion so that's what that
looks like and then now I'm going to put
mascara on my lower lashes this would be
wet wild lash renegade mascara eyes are
done now we're just going to go ahead
and move on to lips I'm going to use
this wet and wild gel lip liner this is
in the shade where to comment
then I'm going to use this jcat beauty
the list Finity matte lip in the shade
cash money
it's a really great lip product
especially if you're filming out are not
selling especially if you're shooting
outside and you don't want your hair to
get caught in your lip product this is a
really great product to have then that
is the finished makeup look you can
obviously go with a different lip color
if you wanted to but I really love the
way this looks and for me it's like a
comfort zone for filming and photography
anything like that because I know it's
going to look good so I really like the
way this turned out all the drugstore
products look beautiful to me this looks
like a high-end makeup locus and this
does last really well throughout the day
so that is different makeup look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching let me know
down below what you thought in the
comments and if you're excited to try
anything that I showed you in this video
