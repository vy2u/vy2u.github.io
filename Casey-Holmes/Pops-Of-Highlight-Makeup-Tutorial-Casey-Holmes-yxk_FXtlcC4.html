with me and I'm just showing you guys
this makeup look I wanted to play with
this Alice Through the Looking Glass
palette from Urban Decay because this is
a first urban decay palette that I'm
like oh my god this is beautiful I think
the packaging is really bulky but I just
pulled this out which I think it's
really handy I love you can just pull
out the palette I didn't use the brush
but I just I don't know I wanted to play
with this so bad I also used some
different products in here and I also
use this amazing Beauty Blender dupe
which is awesome so if you guys don't
see how I got this makeup look then
let's just get started with the video
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
is take this vanilla shade and I'm going
to apply this all over the lid using a
flat shader brush just so we have a nice
base for the rest of our eye shadows
moving I'm going to take this color
right here which is a great transition
shade it is a matte shade and I'm just
going to blend this into my crease and
I'm going to just build this up it is a
pretty pigmented color but I did go a
little bit deeper with it not too deep
but I wanted the crease to be pre
defined and then fluffed it up towards
the brow
you
next up I'm going to take this darker
shade right here and I'm going to put
this into the crease as well but I'm
using a pencil brush just to give it a
more defined look because I did want a
pretty defined crease for this kind of
like a cut crease kind of not you know
that kind of thing so I just wanted to
deepen it up a little bit and this color
is perfect because it's just a few
shades darker than the one we put on to
blend up towards the brow
next I'm taking this blending brush
which is a clean one and I'm just going
to blend that out a little bit just so
it's not too harsh and doesn't have any
jagged edges then I'm going to take this
color right here this is kind of a red
pink color it's really pretty it is a
shimmer shade I'm going to use a dense
flat shader brush to put this all over I
did find that I had to pack this color
on but once it was on it was a really
really pretty color
next I'm going to take this shade right
here and I'm going to put this in the
center of the lid just to highlight this
area I decided to highlight certain
areas of the face in this look so I
highlighted right in the center of the
eye the inner corner of the brows in the
middle of the lips and also my face but
I really wanted like little pops of
highlights to stand out and kind of make
the look pop so I'm just gonna again dab
this all over in the center and then I'm
going to blend the edges of that as well
this is kind of one of those things
where you have to go in and out in and
out with the different colors that you
have but once you get at how you want it
and just blend it out it will look great
you can go a little bit deeper not so
deep it's just up to you then I'm gonna
take this shade right here in this NYX
palette it's kind of like a red brown
color and I decided to use that to
deepen the crease up a little bit more
because I wanted a nice kind of rich
brown so that's what I'm doing here the
same technique I did with the second
shade that we used in this look
now I'm just taking that red pink shade
and I'm going to kind of carve out the
edge of that Brown that we just put on
and also kind of clean up any edges from
where the white may have gotten all over
then I'm going to line my eyes I'm using
the Make Up For Ever liquid liner and
I'm gonna do a winged eyeliner with this
this is by far my favorite eyeliner to
use because it's so black and it dries
matte and I feel like that looks like a
really nice clean look and I did kind of
make my eyes a little jagged after I was
done with my lashes these are the velour
fluff and whispies but um you know I
couldn't see the lashes were just so big
then I'm taking these Smashbox primer
water you benefit Porefessional and the
smashbox one heck of a blot primer and
then i'm using the smashbox to do skin
finish foundation actually just
mentioned this in my may favorites and
i'm applying it all over with this
beauty blender that I got from Ulta I
really like it I do find that it soaks
up quite a bit of product but it is
really nice for underneath the eyes and
for like a really really heavy coverage
foundation I wouldn't use it again with
this foundation just because it does
soak up so much and the Beauty Blender
doesn't really do that as much as this
one but it is really great for heavy
coverage foundations concealer anything
like that even probably cream contouring
it would be great for but I love it it's
really bouncy fluffy and I purchased it
was two for six I believe in one little
packet which is awesome so I use my
Urban Decay and it gets skin concealer
cuz I can't get away from it and I'm
also setting with the Laura Mercier
translucent powder I am baking my face
this is my favorite thing to do right
now I just find that it really helps my
oily skin stay matte throughout the days
especially if it's really hot and humid
then I'm using the Anasazi dip brow in
soft Brown here I have been using a
different browser greatly but I will
mention that in my next favorites video
so you guys can see it and I'll also
include it in the tutorial when I film
one I just have a had a chance you guys
know I've been on vacation okay so I've
just haven't had time to film but you
will see it really soon and then I'm
going to wipe away all that translucent
powder and you're left with a nice matte
highlighted finish
I'm right here I'm just cleaning up the
brows a concealer and then I'm going to
set with the Anastacio brow gel in
brunette I love this because it just
makes your brows look so much more
natural I love it
after that we're gonna bronze with this
Urban Decay bronzer and bronze and I
love this it's a very deep bronzer it's
gorgeous it's nice and warm and it just
makes you look like you came back from
the beach it's stunning and I'm using a
benefit brush to apply that you can also
use a Real Techniques blush brush it's
kind of like the same idea same shape
everything like that so if you didn't
want to splurge on this you could
definitely check that out then I'm using
a real techniques contour brush and I'm
going to use that same bronzer and I'm
just going to lightly put this
underneath my cheekbone just to kind of
carve that out and make it my face look
nice and summer taking this lorac blush
in Technicolor I love this color so much
I'm just going to apply this to my
cheeks these are very pigmented but a
little goes a long way and these blend
out really well so if you do apply too
much they do blend out very very easily
they're one of my favorite blushes right
now then I'm taking this makeup
revolution highlighter palette actually
got this off line on Ulta taking that
middle shade I'm gonna highlight my face
with it I have to admit it's not one of
my favorites I like they're single
highlighters more they're much more
intense and kind of in-your-face but if
you want more of a subtle glow this is
really nice and it does give you that
great highlighted effect then I'm gonna
take a shimmery vanilla color and
highlight underneath the brow this
really makes that brow pop makes it look
nice and lifted and going with the
highlight on the lid it just looks so
good especially when you put it in the
inner corner like I'm doing now I love
this look so much I just love the pops
of highlight
and I'm really packing this on because I
want it to be kind of like the focus of
this look and then I'm going in with
this Makeup Forever aqua liner this is a
brown liner but it kind of turns into a
red Brown on my waterline I really like
it makes my brown eyes pop and I think
it looks really good with the reddish
pink eyeshadow that we have going on all
over the lid then I'm going to take that
same color I was just talking about and
apply this underneath my lower lash line
I'm just pressing it right up against
that lower waterline and lash line and
just blending out with this pencil brush
next up I'm taking the better than sex
of waterproof mascara one of my
favorites it's so good and I'm just
gonna put this on my lower lashes then
I'm taking this lip liner I believe it's
from Milani it's in 0-6 I'm just going
to line in my lips with this product is
a great neutral lip liner going in with
this Afra charm'd liquid lipstick I love
this it's the Mannie and Oprah collab I
love this color I mentioned in my last
favorites video as well I just can't
seem to get enough of it and it goes
with this looked perfectly I was so
happy with this lip color and the eye
combo is just oh my fave I keep saying
that but I just think it's so pretty and
then when I actually did I took that
same vanilla shade and put it in the
center of my lips and then that was it
so I hope you guys enjoyed it thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see
you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
