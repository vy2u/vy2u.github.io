one that needs to be done because I have
a lot of stuff it's products I've used
up and I just keep it in this Mac bag
right here it's pretty large and it's
been full it's been kind of full for a
while now but I wanted to wait till I
finish more makeup products but I was
just like you know what I need to just
film this and throw this stuff away but
next product I used up will definitely
have a lot more makeup in it cuz I'm
almost done with so much stuff so let's
get started shall we
I'm not going to make this video like 20
minutes either personally for my videos
I just like it when I show you say yes I
like it no I don't like it blah blah
blah and then I'm done with it first off
we have the purity from philosophy one
fish one step facial cleanser I love
this stuff I did repurchase another one
it's worked really well for my skin and
I just I think it's really really good
this is actually something I used up
last night this is a Garnier skin or
nude dark spot treatment mask now I
didn't really like this it may when skin
look nice and glowy and it just worked
really well I felt like it did hydrate
my skin so I definitely want to get two
more of these that was a really cool
mask to try and it was really refreshing
as well Oh what do you know I swear
every price I've used that video has one
of these in it because I love it and I
go through it like crazy
it's the macadamia do prepare masks I
would definitely purchase it again
obviously because it's always in these
videos because it's just really good and
I have to have it in my hair care
routine I have a self tanner we have the
saint jump a bronzing mousse this is a
self tan dark I really do like this I'm
actually using a different one it looks
a little bit more natural in my opinion
I would repurchase it I have repurchased
it before and I have been using it but
I'm using a different one that I'll show
you guys here in a minute so I do love
it to me it's just not as natural as the
one I'm using now but it gives you a
nice dark color next we have the Herbal
Essence hydrolysis recondition and
conditioner I do like this stuff I
thought it was great it made my hair
feel really soft and smelt really good
if you watched my hair care
which I will have link down below I did
mention this and I just I really do like
it how do they Shampoo as well I think I
like this I can't remember I have this
toned body wash I absolutely love these
I think they last so long on the skin
I can literally use it and then smell
myself later and I will smell like this
stuff it's really good this was a
different scent for me it's cocoa butter
mango splash but I did enjoy it but we
have not one not two not three but four
batiste dry shampoos can you tell I like
this stuff but I just adore it I go
through these all the time I'm on a new
one now I'm gonna have to go buy some
more backups just in case but I love
this stuff so good for my girls with
dark hair so so good so I'm another tone
of body wash this is my favorite one
it's the white clay and pink Jasmine
smells so good
love it love it love it I threw some and
makeup wipes in here these are the
Neutrogena makeup remover wipes
I do enjoy these I mentioned them in my
skincare routine or so one where I
showed you guys how I take off my makeup
I'll have it linked down below as well
I'm currently using some different ones
and trying them out but these were
really nice and I've gone through like
millions of these I have the lush big
sea salt shampoo adore it this is also
mentioned in my hair care routine I
swear you guys after I filmed those like
haircare and skincare videos I ran out
of everything so I didn't purchase
everything that I ran out of and this
was one of them as well I love the Big C
style shampoo it's really good and gets
all of the dirt and stuff out of my hair
all the dry shampoo that I use because
obviously I use a lot I have a camera
below dry spray adore this stuff I
repurchased another one recently and
I've been falling back in love with it
it protects your hair from the heat from
the blow-dryer it makes your hair nice
and shiny love it swear by this thing
you've got to go try it and it also
smells really really good I have my take
a deep breath from philosophy
moisturizer I love this stuff it's great
for oily skin it's a gel cream
moisturizer so it really sinks into the
skin nice and quickly and it's oil free
and it just works really well so use
that up and I did repurchase another one
okay next I do have the lush tea tree
water toner this is a smaller size I
love this I use as my toner everyday and
every night I do every purchase it I
repurchase the big size of it currently
using it it's great stuff like I said
I'll leave my skincare video down below
I have the Maybelline Dream matte powder
this has a little bit left around the
ridge in spec but I love this stuff I
have repurchased another one I've
actually purchased probably three of
these and I can't stand it when powder
gets around the edges because I can
never get it on my brush so I decided
just the toss this one but I use the
color stand a medium oh one and it's
good stuff especially if you have oily
skin it's great to touch up throughout
the day I did use up this attend a
miracle leave-in product I did like this
I like the camera one better so I won't
be repurchasing this but it was nice
while I used to I used it mainly in the
summer time and I did really enjoy it
but ever since I found the Kimber one
that's like the only spray I've been
using and I really love it so use that
also used my Bobbi Brown hydrating eye
cream I do repurchase this it is so good
you guys I used to be really
self-conscious about the super fine
lines they had underneath my eyes and I
read somewhere else I think it was
online I was reading reviews about this
and the girl said that she was she had
like little fine lines to and she was
young and the girl at Sephora told her
it was probably because it was like
dehydrated underneath there and she
bought this and it really helped like
hydrate her underneath her eyes and kind
of like reduced the look of those so I
got it and it's done the same thing for
me it is very expensive but it does work
very well and I swear by it which is
baha'i about another one also use this
up this is like the first thing I think
I put in this bag is the seventh a
little control moisturizer this is a
nice moisturizer from the drugstore if
your you have oily skin and you're
looking for one this is really nice I
enjoyed it of course I used it up
actually did repurchase this um but I've
been using my philosophy once cuz I just
like them a little bit but
but this is a good one if you're looking
for one that's convenient at the
drugstore I used up I have one of these
bottles in here I should have to the
preference lush cherry based violet this
is the color that I use from L'Oreal
mention it my haircare video as well
check that out below we have four more
things I told you have a lot of stuff in
this one I used up the twelve benefits
instant healthy hair treatment this is
good stuff especially if you're a
blondie when I was lon I swore by this I
put in my hair all the time and it's
really great there's a lot of different
things it's kind of like the ten benefit
what is it it's kind of like the is the
ten but with twelve things so it's good
stuff I would ask your stylist where you
can get it or you can probably find it
on Amazon but it is really good if you
have like super dry damaged hair I did
use up the Vita Liberata self care this
is currently the one I'm using - a
little incident my favorites video from
like a month or two back it did kind of
leak on me so that was the first time it
happened like that but it does kind of
leak here at the top but it's a great
self tanner like it looks really natural
and it blends into the skin beautifully
especially with a mitt so I love it I
highly recommend that this is the one
I've been using constantly and I just I
love it
so be deliberative this is a two to
three week tan and dark don't agree with
a two to three week claim but it's still
really good last two or makeup products
have eye makeup for ever super matte
loose powder adore this stuff I know
it's back in stock you guys a lot of you
let me know and you know I ordered one
for me and I might have ordered one for
you you know I loved it I loved it for
like over a year now and I also used up
my Mac prep and prime skin refine zone
and I did we purchased this because I
love it so much it's great at keeping
you matte and it also helps with pores
as well and I use it every single day I
love it so that is it for the parts I
used up I hope you guys enjoyed this
