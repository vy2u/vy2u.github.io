products I've used up and my bag has
gotten a little full so I figured I
would go ahead and show you guys I'm
just going to start from the top and
also if you're wondering I did curl my
hair with my nume 25 millimeter one but
coupon codes for the two for $100 coupon
is still activated below I'll leave all
the discount codes below as well they're
still going on so if you're interested
you can check that out now I'm going to
be filming a let's talk getting ready
with new products I've purchased so keep
an eye out for that I'll try to have it
up tomorrow
if not I'll probably be Tuesdays so just
let you know but the first thing I have
in here is this clear health hair scalp
and therapy shampoo and I use this stuff
a lot actually did a blog post on my
hair care routine when I do so if you're
interested in that I'll leave my blog
down below but I did use up these
shampoo and I love this stuff I kind of
want to try different shampoos and
conditioners out so let me know your
favorite ones down below but I like this
stuff a lot it's been really great to my
hair next I have this satin care Olay
shave gel for sensitive skin and I
didn't really like this I didn't think
it was really anything special I think
this skintimate one for sensitive skins
a lot better the one that's lotion eyes
sensitive skin lotion is one that was
really good but this one kind of dry my
skin out so I didn't really like it
next I have this toned body wash I love
this stuff it's in the white clay and
pink Jasmine this is a really great body
wash because I feel like it lingers on
your skin for a while and it smells
really good yeah it smells very very
good and I recommend this one it's from
the drugstore and it just is amazing I
like the fact that throughout the day I
can smell my skin and it still smells
like this stuff I also have two
Neutrogena makeup remover wipes in here
I finally used up this Aveeno positively
radiant skin brightening daily scrub I
love this for exfoliating my skin
don't use it everyday just for when I
want to exfoliate and it's really nice
on my skin it's not too harsh or
anything it doesn't make it super super
red but yeah I finally use this up and I
did purchase another one and it's in my
shower now and I like this I think it
smells really good I have this healthy
sexy hair soy try wheat leave-in
conditioner I finally used this up this
is the 16.9 fluid out so it's a big
bottle and I really like this stuff now
I'm actually using other products for my
hair at the moment that I'm really
liking I tend to switch out styling
products pretty often so I am using
something else but if I do want to go
back to this I definitely will
repurchase it because it left my hair
really nice and soft and it does smell
really good I have a couple candles in
here I'll just go ahead and show you
guys me and Colton are really into
candles with our new apartment
everything we just love having them
burning all the time so the first one is
the Caribbean escape this one smells
good it says diving tents land of
tropical melon raspberry nectar and
lemon mellowed by creamy coconut milk
and raw sugar cane I don't know what any
of that probably smells like but this
smells really really really good this is
what I Colton's favourites it's called
Rio gloves was like one of their newer
ones and I love these newer candle if I
tried to purchase some more the other
day but they didn't have them out
anymore but it's called a tantalizing
blend of tropical mango papaya and guava
as a vibrant Rio's Carnival Samba till
sunrise I don't know but it's not really
good and then this one's one of my
favorites
it's called poolside it literally
smelled like the pool like if you're
just laying out you smell this it said
lemon orange and tropical blossoms get
into a splash of coconut and a fragrance
that reveals the cool side of being
poolside I have a salon care 20 regular
lift volume from whenever I die my
and same with the color I have the
Loreal preference mega browns in
chocolate and it has the basis of red
and violet a lot of you asked me if my
hair was turning red and stuff like that
actually did just diet again with a red
hair dye but it didn't turn out as red
as I wanted it to so it's kind of the
same color as it was but with the basis
of red and violet in this color that I
always use when it starts fading that's
when the red really comes out next I
have the body shop this is the
exfoliator the coconut cream body scrub
this was a great exfoliator it smells
really really good
but recently I've been using a different
foliar that I mentioned in my favorites
video for the month I would repurchase
this but if not anytime soon because I'm
really in love with the one I'm using
because it has like oil and stuff it's
just amazing on the skin but if you're
looking for a good scrub for
self-tanning or anything like that you
do recommend this little guy is all
palette upright next I have this
Hawaiian Tropic silk hydration SPF 30 I
love this stuff I use SPF 30 running
outside tanning or anything
I mentioned my favorite ones in my
current favorites for the month of June
but this one's really great for the face
and I like this still hydration of mine
because I feel like it is very very
moisturizing and it doesn't dry your
skin on or anything so I definitely
recommend checking out that line through
for a new sunscreen and then surprise
surprise I have a macadamia deep affair
mask I have one of these in my last
video and I love it of course memory
purchased it I gotta have it
it's amazing and it's great for super
dry hair you can leave it in overnight
you believe in for the shit when you're
in the shower for like 10 minutes and it
just leaves your hair super super soft
and that stuff it's like $30 so it lasts
me for about three to four months so
it's definitely worth the money and then
I'm a couple makeup products in here
yeah I rarely have
products the first one is my makeup
forever of matte buff applies this is
actually in number 40 and I was really
happy I use this up because I have been
using it first toe long enough like I'm
never going to get through this but
number 40 was my most common shade and I
really love this foundation you guys
know I have three more on my door that I
just have to mix and match to get my
right color but yeah I use one of those
up and then the last thing is this
covergirl lash perfection mascara I love
this mascara currently I wouldn't go and
repurchase in now just because I have a
bunch I'm trying to play with and use up
but this is great I would repurchase it
after I use the rest of mine up because
it's a great separating mascara and it
works with pretty much any other mascara
if you want to kind of combine two or
anything I've also had this inner
products I've used up video before as
well so definitely recommend checking
this one out so those are all the
products I've used up I hope you guys

have purchased so thank you guys so much
