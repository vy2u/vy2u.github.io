products I've used up and my bag has
gotten a little full so i figured i
would go ahead and show you guys i'm
just going to start from the top and
also if you're wondering um I did curl
my hair with my new me 25 millimeter
wand the coupon codes for the two for
one hundred dollars coupon is still
activated below I'll leave all the
discount posts below as well they're
still going on so if you're interested
you can check that out now I'm going to
be filming a um let's talk in ready with
new products i purchased so keep an eye
out for that i'll try to have it up
tomorrow if not i'll probably be tuesday
so just let you know but the first thing
I have in here is this clear Heller hair
scalp and therapy shampoo and I use this
stuff a lot actually did a blog post on
my hair care routine when I do so if
you're interested in that i'll leave my
blog down below but i did use up the
shampoo and i love the stuff i kind of
want to try different shampoos and
conditioners out so let me know your
favorite ones down below but i like this
stuff a lot it's been really great to my
hair next I have this satin care olay
shave gel for sensitive skin and I
didn't really like this I didn't think
it was really anything special I think
this skintimate one for sensitive skins
a lot better the one that's lotion eyes
sensitive skin lotion is one that was
really good but this one kind of dry my
skin out so I didn't really like it next
I have this toned body wash I love this
stuff it's in the white clay and pink
Jasmine this is a really great body wash
because i feel like it lingers on your
skin for a while and it smells really
good yeah it smells very very good and i
recommend this one it's from the
drugstore and it just is amazing I like
the fact that for all the day I can
smell my skin and it still smells like
this stuff I also
have to neutrogena makeup remover wipes
in here I finally used up this aveeno
positively radiant skin brightening
daily scrub I love this for exfoliating
my skin I don't use it every day just
for when I want to exfoliate and its
really nice on my skin it's not too
harsh or anything does it make it super
super red but yeah finally use this up
and I did purchase another one and it's
my showered now and I like this I think
it smells really good I have this
healthy sexy hair soy try wheat leave-in
conditioner I finally use this up this
is the 16.9 fluid out so it's a big
bottle and I really like this stuff now
i'm actually using other products for my
hair at the moment that i'm really
liking I tend to switch out styling
products pretty often so i am using
something else but if i do want to go
back to this i definitely will
repurchase it because it left my hair
really nice and soft and it does smell
really good i have a couple candles in
here i'll just go ahead and show you
guys me and colton are really into
candles with our new apartment
everything we just love having them
burning all the time so the first one is
the caribbean escape this one smells
good it says diving tins land of
tropical melon raspberry nectar a lemon
mellowed by creamy coconut milk and raw
sugar cane I don't know what any of that
probably felt like but this smells
really really really good this is what I
Colton's favorites it's called Rio
gloves was like one of their newer ones
and i love these newer candles i tried
to purchase the more the other day but
they didn't have a out anymore but it's
called a tantalizing blend of tropical
mango papaya and guava as a vibrant rios
carnival selma till sunrise I don't know
but it's not really good and then this
was one of my favorites it's called
poolside it literally smelled like the
pool like if you're just laying out you
smell this it says lemon orange and
tropical blossoms get into a splash of
coconut in a fragrance that reveals the
cool side of being poolside I
have a salon care 20 regular lift volume
from whenever I dye my hair and same
with the color I have a l'oreal
preference mega Browns in chocolate and
it has the basis of red and violet a lot
of you asked me if my hair I was turning
red and stuff like that I actually did
just diet again with a red hair dye but
it didn't turn out as red as I wanted it
to so it's kind of the same color as it
was but with the basis of red and violet
in this color that I always use when it
starts fading that's when the red really
comes out next I have the body shop this
is the exfoliator the coconut cream by
scrub this was a great exfoliator it
smells really really good but recently
i've been using a different foliar that
i mentioned in my favorites video for
the month I would repurchase this but
not anytime soon because I'm really in
love with the one I'm using because it
has like oil and stuff it's just amazing
on the skin but if you're looking for a
good scrub for self tanning or anything
like that do recommend this little guy
should have a purchase all palate up
right next I had this Hawaiian Tropic
silk hydration SPF 30 I love this stuff
I use SPF 30 running outside tanning or
anything I mentioned my favorite ones in
my current favorites for the month of
june but this one's really great for the
face and i like the silk hydration line
because i feel like it is very very
moisturizing and it doesn't dry skin on
or anything so i definitely recommend
checking out that line for a new
sunscreen and then surprise surprise I
have a macadamia deep repair masque I
have one of these in my last video and I
love it of course memory purchased it I
gotta have it it's amazing and it's
great for super dry hair you can leave
it in overnight you believe in fridge
when you're in the shower for like 10
minutes and it just leaves your hair
super super soft and that stuff it's
like thirty dollars that last me for
about three to four months so it's
definitely worth the money and then i
had a couple makeup products in here
yeah i rarely
makeup products the first one is my
makeup forever Matt Buffett Plus this is
actually in number 40 and I was really
happy i use this up because i have been
using it for so long off like I'm never
going to get through this but number 40
was my most common shade and I really
love this foundation you guys know I
have three more my joy that I just have
to mix and match to get my right color
but yeah I use one of those up and then
the last thing is this covergirl lash
perfection mascara I love this mascara
currently I wouldn't go and reports in
now just because I have a bunch of
trying to play with and use up but this
is great I would repurchase it after I
use the rest of mine up because it's a
great separating mascara and it worship
pretty much any other mascara if you
want to kind of combine two or anything
I've also had this inner products I've
used up video before as well so
definitely recommend checking this one
out so those are all the products I've
used up I hope you guys enjoyed this
video don't forget about the videos i'm
posting hopefully tomorrow with the new
beauty products i have purchased so
