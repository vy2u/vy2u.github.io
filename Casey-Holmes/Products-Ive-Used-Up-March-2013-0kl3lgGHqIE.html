products I'm used up my camera is dying
I know a lot of you who like the last
products I've used that video I did so I
figured I would save up some more stuff
and show you guys what I've got so the
first thing is a batiste dry shampoo I
love this stuff I've talked about a lot
and I go through dry shampoo like crazy
next I have the venus pro skin moisture
rich little razor refills and i love
these I think they're great
I use these last time the only thing is
these are pretty expensive like $15 to
get a refill I like them but I recommend
buying them at Walmart so you can get
more you get like an extra razor I think
you get four is 3b next is this soap &amp;amp;
Glory righteous butter so it's a body
butter and it's from step and Glory and
it smells so good you can get this at
Sephora I definitely got to pick another
one up because it is amazing it like did
so many great things for my dry skin and
I really highly recommend it it's one of
the best body butters I've ever tried I
do have another body butter in the air
this is from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works the Paris
amor this is also a great one I don't
think it's as hydrating as the soap &amp;amp;
Glory one but it's still really good and
it's only $15 at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works next
I have this simple sensitive skin
experts facial wash I love this I talked
about this in my skincare routine this
really helped my redness and it just
made my skin super super clear so highly
recommend that then I have to face order
makeup remover wipes we have the simples
this is skin experts little face wipes
and we often have Neutrogena so
Neutrogena is my favorite I felt like
the simple ones kind of broke me out so
I have I'm gonna be repurchasing these
but I've ever purchasing the Neutrogena
ones
it's like crazy next I have my son guys
self tanner and dark I talk about this a
lot a link down below and a coupon code
if you guys are interested but I love
this I think it's great and it leaves
very very dark next I have the st. Ives
moisturizing body wash I think I should
this one in my last one - but it's
paraben free really amazing smells super
good and you get a lot for your money so
I think this is like 3 or 4 bucks I
can't remember but it's a really nice
body wash and I do recommend it next I
have the Listerine cool mint mouthwash
pretty simple and going with the teeth
stuff I have two 3d white what is this
toothpaste once the glamorous white and
other one is the business right now I'm
using Colgate optic white I wanna see if
it doesn't eat better than those two I
also have the l'oreal colour riche nail
lingerie i did not like these at all
they're like the little nail stickers at
L'Oreal has and they're kind of the
faded glare one i know they don't have
any on here now i didn't like them at
all they lasted literally one day on me
because they started peeling off my nail
the kiss brand has really great nail
stickers but these i wouldn't purchase
again and they were pretty expensive i
also have the secret invisible solid ph
part of fresh deodorant I personally
like the gel deodorants better but this
was nice and smelled good I mean it's
nothing that vo Harlan right I also have
the macadamia and deep repair mask
obsessiveness I have to repurchase it
because I feel like something is missing
from my hair care routine it really made
my hair super soft and it was so
manageable and I absolutely loved it so
I'm definitely gonna have to pick this
back up because it is amazing I have
another batiste dry shampoo but I go
through them like crazy I have some more
things first one is the Rimmel match
perfection concealer this is great I
actually really like it I tried to use
all of it up you could kind of see
through the bottle a little bit but it
started getting a little clumpy I think
it was just getting old so I had to toss
this but it's a great concealer if you
looking for one from the drugstore and
last but not least
my baby this is a villa juicy perfume
this was the really big bottle and it is
all gone really sad about it but this
was the best perfume I've ever used I'm
definitely gonna purchase it because
it's amazing it lasts all day and
literally I always get compliments every
time I used to wear this so love this
thing and I like I said I'd definitely
recommend that so those are all the
products I've used that past couple
months if you still continue to like
