all about products I've used up I've got
them in this poor bag and if you watched
my previous price I've used up videos
you know that I don't like to drag this
video on for like 1,200 minutes because
I don't like long products I've used up
videos I think it's just kind of boring
I like it when they get to the point
stay what they like and move it along
and I will go ahead and say I did dye my
hair if you follow me on my social media
sites Facebook Twitter Instagram you
already know this and I absolutely love
it I know a lot of you love the dark but
I am digging this ombre explained all
about my hair in a video I filmed
yesterday which was a haul so that will
be up soon
I thought I was gonna put it up earlier
but turns out I have some other videos I
need to put up first so that will be up
either this week or next week so just
stay tuned for that I explain where I
got it done and everything thank you
guys for all the sweet comments that
you've left if you have left one I know
a lot of people love the fully dark
brown hair but it's fun to change up
your hair color spring will be here
before you know hopefully and I mean I
absolutely love it I feel like it makes
me look so much more like alive and
summery and just warms me up so let's
get started with these okay so the first
things I'm going to talk about are these
bath and Bodyworks shower gels these are
the cashmere glow scent and I got this
during the winter months and I don't
know if this is like a permanent color
color no I don't know this is a
permanent scent but it really should be
because it's awesome I would use this
year-round
oh it just smells so good next are these
simple sensitive skin experts oil
balancing cleansing wipes I did really
like these I kind of feel like it made
my skin a little bit more red though I
actually don't use makeup remover wipes
to remove makeup anymore I use a cleanse
off oil which I've talked about before
in my December favorites video so I'll
leave that down below if you want
check it out I plan on doing like an
updated nighttime routine just so you
guys can see me use my products in
action but no longer use these for my
face anymore probably will only be with
purchasing these to take off makeup on
my hand or something okay it is not a
products I've used up video without a
macadamia deeper pear mask
I literally have these and almost I
think every single products I've used up
video you know I love it it's amazing
especially going ombre I put this on my
hair right half dry wet ombre and my
hair was feeling so smooth and alive
again okay now I have a purity one-step
facial cleanser adore this purchase
about three of them takes off all your
makeup really nicely and it's just one
of my favorites it doesn't dry out your
skin so I highly recommend this one okay
I've got three lush products and I'm
going to keep these little guys so I can
get a free mask I want a free mask cuz
you need five clean lush spots with this
logo and you get a mask for free so I'm
gonna go ahead and tell you guys the two
things I won't repurchase from lush and
that is the ocean salt face and body
scrub and the rub rub rub now let me go
ahead and say I am like one of those
people that everybody can rave about
something and then when I try it I don't
like it that happens all the time to me
I don't know what it is people love this
ocean salt stuff and I just don't see
what the hype is about I just I love my
back and body works one more it's like
the eucalyptus scrub because it takes
off my dead skin but yet still mixing
skin super super smooth so I don't know
I just didn't see what the high post
about this I I mean I used it up because
it was expensive but I'm not gonna
repurchase it and the same goes for the
red rub rub I just liked this one a lot
more than the ocean salt because it
didn't really excite my skin very well
and I didn't really like it for
self-tanner because I rely on stuff to
really take off my self-tanner and like
exfoliate the skin and if it doesn't do
that then we have issues so send me a
long time to use this up but it finally
did to an item I love and would
repurchase is the big sea salt shampoo I
love this stuff it gave me a ton of
volume and it really was awesome and
taking
all that gunk out of your hair and just
starting your hair off with a fresh
clean slate I mean this left nothing
behind so highly recommend this stuff it
was awesome to use okay speaking of hair
I do have a batiste dry shampoo this is
like always in my videos as well love
this will always always always always
always repurchase it new body butters I
have the Clinique a deep comfort oh
buckle in the deep comfort body butter
and also the soap &amp;amp; Glory righteous body
butter this one smells amazing
this one is fragrance free the how to
choose between one repurchase it would
definitely be the Clinique because I
love that it's fragrance free so I could
put on my perfume and not feel like it's
all clashing together if you have too
many scents going on it can just be way
too much so I love this one since it is
fragrance free doesn't irritate my skin
at all this one doesn't irritate my skin
but it is a pretty strong scent I mean
this smells absolutely divine but let's
just be real if I had to choose one it
read the Clinic body butters but I did
use up my glam glow super mud clearing
treatment masque love this idea
repurchase another one and it's one of
my favorite masks ever especially if I
am breaking out or something highly
recommend this I also used up this Bobbi
Brown hydrating eye cream this is
amazing I used to have really bad
dehydration lines underneath my eyes and
now I don't anymore because I use this
stuff and I'm telling you this this is
amazing if you're having a hard time
with your concealer caking underneath
your eyes or if you do have those
dehydration lines you need this in your
life because it will really moisturize
underneath there and I use a lot of
concealer a lot of you know that because
I just is one of my favorite parts of
makeup and my concealer never looks
cakey makeup starts from the skin up you
have to take care of your skin if you
want your makeup to look really nice but
to the point this stuff is amazing and I
will continue to repurchase this last
the skin care product is this out Genest
firming and lifting cream I've actually
tried a few moisturizers from this brand
and I'm obsessed I love it when I get
these samples because it's probably the
best moisturizer I've ever tried in my
life I went on Sephora and looked at
their prices and they are very very very
very pricey but I mean it's good stuff
after I used up all my moisturizers I
will definitely be
purchasing one of these because this is
a second sample I've tried from them and
I've been head over heels sing and then
we move on to make up I have the Vita
Liberata phenomenal two to three week
tan and dark don't agree with a two to
three week claim but I love the
self-tanner it's the only one I've been
using for months now and I highly highly
highly recommend it it's just so easy to
work with use it with a mitt and you're
good to go I lied I have one more
skincare item this is the L'Oreal youth
code texture Perfector my favorite
daytime serum ever I use my Estee Lauder
advanced night repair as my nighttime
serum obsessed with that but this one I
used for a daytime I've used it for
quite a few months did repurchase
another one and I'm almost out of that
one as well I just think this stuff is
amazing and I will definitely continue
to repurchase it until I find something
better moving on some makeup I do have
these Ardell natural multi pack these
were the demi whispies feel like the
demi whispies are the most well known
lashes from ardell just because they're
amazing
easy to work with lightweight and I
really do love them I also used up this
Mac prep and prime skin or a fine zone
I've used up two of these I actually
repurchased a Smashbox photo matte
primer just because I wanted to try
something different but these are really
awesome I purchased three of them use
them all up and I do really like them to
keep you very matte so if you have oily
skin i would definitely recommend these
because they are phenomenal
I use these as a primer and they work
perfectly for my skin for another primer
and have this NARS Pro prime smudge
proof eyeshadow base if you're having a
hard time finding primers that keep your
eyeshadow on and you have really oily
eyelids this is what I recommend will
keep your eyeshadow on all day I'm not
even kidding you have to try this out I
know it's expensive it's definitely
worth it next I have this liner it's
from Maybelline and steel I'm stiletto I
did really enjoy this eyeliner the felt
tip is quite large so sometimes it gets
a little difficult to get a really
flicked out winged eyeliner but this was
really awesome I can't say I would
repurchase it because I've tried so many
different ones and I currently have a
new favorite drugstore liner at the
moment but this was really really nice
and I do recommend it if you're just
looking for a new one to try out I also
have my
Asya brow is in brunette my brow
products like what I use tend to change
a lot just because I like to try
different things but the one thing that
stays the same is this brow is I cannot
be without it I just am in love with it
I think it's amazing ok now for just two
mascaras this is it for the price I've
used up this is the Maybelline the
rocket mascara I love this stuff it's
probably one of my favorite drugstore
mascaras it's really great I've given
you a lot of volume and it doesn't clump
up really bad and it lasts all day long
so this is definitely one of my favorite
drugstore ones and then for high end I
love my wife's L baby doll this is by
far one of my favorite mascaras I've
ever tried I do have a full review and
demo on this mascara and I will link
that down below if you want to check it
out but to me I think it's definitely
worth the money okay so that is it for
my products I've used up I hope you guys

thumbs up if you want me to continue to
do these types of videos as the months
go on and don't forget to subscribe to
my channel and leave some comments down
below of some makeup videos you guys

many ideas that it can't process on

one of my new favorite drugstore
foundations so yeah other than that let
