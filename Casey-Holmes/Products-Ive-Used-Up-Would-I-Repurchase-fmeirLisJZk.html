on products I've used up and I have used
up quite a bit of stuff in the past like
what less than a half two months I did
one not too long ago and I've just
accumulated quite a bit so I figured I
would go ahead and show you guys what I
got so let's just start out with the
thing that has been in every products
I've used up video this is the macadamia
deep repair mask I love this stuff I
will forever repurchase it as long as I
feel like it's doing something for my
hair I love this stuff I think it's
amazing I talk about every products I've
used that video so definitely recommend
that next up I have this bumble and
bumble bee bee Sunday shampoo basically
this is the clarifying shampoo but I did
like this for clarifying
I have other products that I like to use
to clarify like I just purchased the big
shampoo from lush which is the sea salt
shampoo I love that stuff so I think
I'll just continue to repurchase that
but this was nice while I used it I also
have this bow mutton bumble bee be
gentle shampoo I think this was supposed
to moisturize your hair yeah it says
it's um a mild luxurious cleanser and
moisture for softness and shine a must
for dry a must for damage or dryness due
to hair color or perms I didn't notice
that this made my hair any softer or
anything like that so um I won't be
repurchasing this I'm using another one
now that I feel like makes my hair
pretty soft so I'll probably mention
that to you guys really soon but this
one I I'm probably not going to
repurchase it okay next up we have two
my favorite self tanner this is the Vita
Liberata self tanner in dark I love this
self tanner it's by far my favorite I
haven't purchased a different one since
I started using this and I still have
one in my bathroom now that's just
currently what I use and what I love if
you guys want to see like a self-tanning
video like me applying the self tanner
what I do before I apply self tanner
then let me know in the comments below
because I've been thinking about it but
I want to do it unless I really want to
see it next up we have the philosophy
take a deep breath moisturizer I did
repurchase this I do like
as my daytime moisturizer it's oil free
and it's just a great gel moisturizer to
really sink into your skin nicely oh
okay oh I have another Vito liver on a
self-tanner in here I also have the
batiste dry shampoo in a deep its the
hint of color for a dark and deep brown
hair I love the stuff I've I go through
these like water it's not even funny I
also have another one of these cashmere
glows this is from Bath and Body Works I
love this scent it smells so good I have
another one in my shower now I stocked
up because I thought they were a
seasonal thing and then I found out they
weren't so I'm really happy about that
but I like these I don't think they make
your skin super moisturizer or anything
like that I just love the smell of this
next up we have Gloria youth code
texture Perfector I love this stuff wait
and bought a new one I'm on my third one
now and I'm actually almost done with
that one as well so I love this I will
probably repurchase it but I really want
to try something else like a different
serum for the morning time so if you
guys recommend one that I can try out
for the morning time let me know I think
I want to try one from Lancome or
something but if you know one from the
drugstore that's really good for oily
skin too then totally let me know this
is an awesome product and if I can't
find anything I like I will definitely
be going back to this one next up this
is the third to last skin care item so
this is a full of promise from
philosophy it's a moisturizer and it is
a dual action restoring cream for volume
and lift I do like this I had somebody
tell me that was mainly for like older
women but I loved it I think it made my
skin feel really plump and luxurious and
it was really thick cream so it was
great for nighttime I love it I'll
probably repurchase this later down the
line but right now I'm using the out
Genest
cream that I showed in my high-end
makeup haul a while back and I've been
absolutely loving it but this was a
really really good moisturizer okay I
have this a Bobbi Brown instant
long-wear makeup remover I did really
enjoy this
now I'm using a Clinique one I'm just
kind of trying different ones out and so
far I do like this one better I think
the Clinique one and the Bobbi Brown one
are basically the same price but I feel
like this one just takes off the eye
makeup a little bit better like the
mascara so yeah I'll probably repurchase
next or like I said if you guys have one
for the drugstore let me know last up
for skincare this is one of my favorite
items this is the boscia makeup breakup
cool cleansing oil I love this stuff
I adore it I will continue to use it I
no longer use makeup remover wipes as
the most of you know and this one is
just it's just so good it takes off all
your makeup it doesn't dry out your skin
and before we get into some beauty
products I want to mention the Beauty
Blender solid I love this for washing my
brushes this is amazing
I used this one completely up and I do
have another one I think this is better
I used to use the Dawn dish detergent
and I did like that but this one just
makes everything so easy just take your
little brush and scroll around in there
rinse off and you're good to go
it's made washing my brushes so much
faster and I love it I just think it's a
great product
okay lashes I used up I've been loving
false lashes first I have these kids
lashes and number one I'll do like a
little picture over here or something to
show you guys what these look like but
the only place that I can find this
little package set of five is from
Walmart and they're about ten dollars so
not too bad and then I also got the demi
whispies and black these are from ardell
they're like one of the most well known
lashes from ardell because they're
amazing okay on to makeup I have the
benefits Porefessional I was using this
so much for like the longest time and I
really do like it but I've just been
playing with different primers and
seeing you know what works best for my
skin but definitely for pore minimizing
this is an awesome primer and I
definitely recommend it and it took me
forever to get through this thing so I
do love that a lot I also have this NARS
eyeliner it's the larger than life
longer eyeliner in Via Veneto is it
Veneto or in Veneto
I think it's many though I don't know
but I like this eyeliner it's the best
for staying on your waterline if you
have watery eyes or if you're a liner
literally does not stay on your
waterline like it smudges down here
like that I would definitely recommend
this because it stays all day long and
it never smudges on me so this is worth
the money I promise you it is so so so
good next I have this uh Nastasia brow
is in brunette and I was using this for
a really long time right now I use the
Tarte brow mousse in taupe which I like
a lot better and I feel like these were
starting to pull out some of my brow
hairs
I don't know has anybody else had an
issue with that like I literally feel
like my brows are getting thinner when I
was using this I don't know let me know
if you've had that kind of thought in
your mind I just I kind of feel like
that so ever since I laid off this
though my brows look gotten thicker and
yeah I don't know if hope you were
purchasing these but I do really like
them on how to say that I think it makes
your brows look so amazing but I just
don't know if I'll be repurchasing this
and then I have a Mac Pro Longwear this
is in NC 20 of this concealer you can
see right there it's all gone but I love
this concealer is so good I now use in
w20 because I feel like it really
brightens underneath my eyes a lot
better than the NC so I like the MW a
lot better now that's the one that I'm
currently using Mac Pro Longwear is by
far the best under eye concealer ever
like nothing compares to it I have been
trying to find different things to use
so you can see something different my
videos but literally this is just the
way to go and then I have two of the YSL
baby doll mascara this one is the sample
that I had forever so of course they use
it up you know of course they are the
full size right here that has been used
up I've used up I think maybe two of
these they do last me quite a long time
but I don't think I'm gonna repurchase
it and I know some you know like what
your loving that mascara for literally
years not years that you know lots of
days and I do I love this mascara but
literally ever since I tried the Too
Faced better than sex mascara it's like
heaven has taken over and it's cheaper
than the YSL one I don't know if it's by
much but I can't really remember but I
know it's cheaper than the YSL one and
it makes my lashes look so thick like I
have false lashes on so I probably won't
be repurchasing this for a while until
I'm like tired of my two-faced mascara
because I bet you all go back to this
okay guys so that's it for all the
products I've used up I hope you guys
enjoyed it this video I personally love
doing these kinds of videos because I
like seeing what I use up because
sometimes I just forget since like
months passed by and I love doing a
little reviews on them so if you want me
to continue to do these then give it a
thumbs up and I will see you guys in my
next video okay I'm gonna try and
introduce you guys to Lily I got her
from the pound Monday it is now Friday

a collie mixed with something but she's
adorable and I love her and yeah if you
