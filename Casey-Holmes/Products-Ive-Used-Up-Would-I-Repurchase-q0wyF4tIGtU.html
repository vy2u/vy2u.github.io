all about products I boost up and my bag
has gone a little bit full so I figured
I would show you guys today what I have
for you if you're wondering this makeup
look I did just film it it will be up
within the next couple of days so just
keep an eye out for it but I really
wanted to go ahead and get this video
filmed it up for you guys because I feel
like I haven't done a products I've used
up video in a minute and this top is
also from a stops if you're wondering if
I can find it I will link it down below
in the description box for you guys so
you can check it out for yourself so
let's just go ahead and get started the
first thing I've got is this tone body
wash I've talked about this before this
is the white clay and pink goo jasmine
body wash and I love this so much
definitely one of my favorite body
washes ever I did repurchase it and with
these videos I kind of like to speed
through things if I especially if I've
already talked about them then I'll just
kind of move it along next up we have
the body business the bags of Body Works
cashmere glow shower gel says this
luxurious scent is a warm blend of
golden peach exotic berries and glowing
lily petals indulged in shimmering
vanilla and cashmere musk honestly
combining lily and Peach like in the
same sentence kind of makes me if I was
just reading it and I didn't actually
purchased it and smell it I would think
it was gross but this smells absolutely
delicious and it's straight-up smells
like peaches next up we have this carrot
therapy keratin infuse moisture shampoo
sulfate free
I loved this a lot I washed my hair
about twice a week so I can use this
whenever I wash my hair because it's not
good to use a lot of keratin on your
hair but I really enjoyed it this one it
was really awesome I got a size salon
and I really enjoyed it made my hair
nice and soft which is different for me
because I feel like a lot of sulfate
free shampoos do not make my hair soft
and kind of lather up in the shower but
this one did and I loved it and the same
thing goes for this caviar anti-aging
replenishing moisture shampoo this is
again free no sulfates parabens sodium
chloride peple oscillates and gluten and
this one again I loved this down these
this one you can get a support this is
on the pricey side but I definitely
recommend
if you're looking for a really nice
sulfate-free shampoo oh I was trying to
smell it have another was like squeezy
tops you see right there it smells
really good too
I like this one a lot I would definitely
repurchase it to buy go through
different shampoos so quickly like I
always try different ones but I would
definitely go if I can pick that one up
and then I have another purity face wash
in here I love this stuff I use it all
the time I love it I have no bad things
to say about it I think this is like my
fourth or fifth month not good bye I
also have this bozo makeup breakup cool
cleansing oil
amazing amazing amazing stuff I do not
use makeup wipes to remove my makeup I
use cleansing oils or I will use what
I'm currently using which is a cleansing
balm and you guys will see that in my
updated routine at videos this one was
so great though I think I went through
about 2 or 3 of these and I love it it's
so good a little does go a long way and
it takes off all of your makeup all
right speaking of taking off all your
makeup this is the Clinique take off the
day makeup remover I love this stuff
this takes off all of my eye makeup and
I'm just obsessed with it I did switch
to a drugstore one after I ran out of
this one and I did not love it at all I
used the one from Maybelline I think
it's like Kleenex press or something
like that but that would stung my eyes
and it didn't take off all of the eye
makeup so I went back to this one and I
loved it I will probably be sticking to
this one for a while I also have this
Carol's Daughter brown sugar scrub it's
a brown shirt its foliage sweet almond
moisturizes and vitamin E nourishes so
if you guys have tried the bath and
Bodyworks eucalyptus scrub this is
basically the same thing but with a
different scent it's very very
moisturizing and it's awesome at
exfoliating your skin it's perfect for
when you're about to shave your legs
just go ahead and put this on and then
go ahead and shave your legs because it
makes them super super soft and I love
this the only thing I don't like about
it is the scent it is a very very very
sweet scent it reminds me of brownies
actually I used to eat the Weight
Watchers brownies a lot back in the day
and I was like craving chocolate and it
reminds me of those so if you smelt
those brownies that is what this smells
like it took me a while to figure it out
but it smells just like those brownies
but I mean I like it I got this also
like a while back and I just ended up
finally using it but I'm definitely
gonna stick with my bath and Bodyworks
eucalyptus Grove because
I like the smell so much better okay
next I have these two beauty blender
cleanser solids I love this for cleaning
my brushes I think this is the best
brush cleanser ever I do not like the
liquid form of the V blender cleanser
but I do like the solid form I feel like
it's so much easier you just take your
brush and swirl it around in the product
and then you just rinse it underneath
your sink and you're good to go
it really does deep clean the brush and
get all of that makeup out and sometimes
it is hard to get like all these
foundation and concealer out but this
does the job
I look next up we have two of these are
toy secret instant bronzing tendance
price I do have any full self-tanning
video which I will link it down below
for you guys but I love this this is not
a self tanner this is a temporary
bronzer and I love this if my neck is
looking a little bit lighter than the
rest of my body or something I will just
touch it up with this spray a little bit
on and I'm good to go it leaves a
gorgeous natural looking tan it doesn't
look too orange or to red it is
absolutely perfect if you need a
temporary bronzer I definitely recommend
this one because they are amazing and
these are 15 bucks apiece
but the Troy seeker always has like
little sales or whatever when you get
three for 30 years something like that
speaking out victory cigarette I might
as well include this this is a
Victoria's Secret self-tanning it tinted
spray this is a self tanner I do like
this I like the lotion one better but
this one is really nice I did like it a
lot I used to really quickly though I
didn't know how to go through it as fast
but but for right now I won't be
repurchasing this but this is an awesome
self tanner if you are looking for an
affordable one because I feel like it's
really hard to find affordable nice self
tanners and this one is one of them I
love the color that it gives as always I
always have a macadamia deep repair mask
in my products I've used up videos just
because this stuff is amazing and I love
it so much
I'm never without this little guy it
saves my hair love it and the same comes
for the batiste dry shampoo for deep
dark hair what is it for a dark and deep
brown hair has a hint of color it's
perfect you can see them two color right
here huh it's so good my hair was so
greasy today and I put this in and it's
like looks like it was freshly washed
Thank You batiste
stuff you have this boreal youth code
texture Perfector you can see right here
I am out on the sides I love to this I
went through about two or three of these
as well and you can get this from the
drugstore now this is one of the more
pricey items in the drugstore I believe
it's about twenty four dollars or so so
it is pretty pretty pricey I'm currently
using a different day time serum that
I'm really loving because after I used
this one up I wanted to try something
new so I picked up another one which
like I said you guys will see in an
upcoming routine video and I've really
been loving that one and I think they're
about the same price so I might stick
with the one that I'm using now because
this one is $24 and it's nice but I
think I found another one that I'm in
love with so I will repurchase it though
like if I can't find another serum this
would definitely be the one I would go
back to because it is really awesome it
makes your skin very very smooth and
then I have the philosophy to take a
deep breath moisturizer love this stuff
I use it every day it's great for the
skin it's a gel cream moisturizer so
it's going to really sink it to the skin
quickly and not leave a greasy film on
the top of your skin which we all know
we hate so I love this I do have to say
I went to Ulta to pick up another one
and I did not know that they had one in
a squeezy tube so I picked up the
squeezy tube instead of the jar I love
this I would just purchase the squeezy
tube again like I have now next up we
have this at Bobby Brown hydrating eye
cream this stuff is bomb-diggity I've
talked about it before but I love it so
much I currently use the extra repair
eye cream and it is like heaven so
moisturizing it feels amazing on the
skin and it makes your concealer go on
beautifully I just love it
currently use the extra repair one for
day and night I think I'm going to
purchase another one of these regular
hydrating eye creams for the morning
time just so it's a little bit lighter
but I really love the Bobbi Brown eye
creams I think they're they're really
moisturizing and if you have like little
dehydration lines or little fine lines I
would definitely recommend picking up
one of these because it's really gonna
hydrate that skin next up we have the sa
Lauder advanced Night Repair Serum swear
by this stuff you guys I still use it
this stuff is very very
but I love it so much nothing has made
my skin feel so good and so smooth I
feel like this really helps my skin so
much just with the way it looks it
doesn't look super dull or anything like
that so I love this stuff it's amazing I
just I can't be without it this is all
like skin care and body hair I had like
one megabyte own salary this is the glam
glow super mud clearing treatment I love
this stuff if you need to clear up your
skin because it's breaking out like
crazy this is the thing to go to this
always clears on my skin so quickly
because sometimes my skin will just have
a spark where it's pissed off and it
just wants to break out like crazy and
now put this on for like two nights in a
row I'd say and it's all cleared up
looks amazing I mean I will not be
without this stuff this is my favorite
one I do have the hydrating one and I do
like that one but this is the one that I
go through the most so if I could
recommend one it would definitely be the
clearing treatment especially if you
have acne prone oily skin that's the
body care product this is Eve I'm gonna
say it's so wrong
locked on bug tank locked on ultra rich
body cream I love this stuff you guys I
don't know if you could see like how
moisturize my skin looks I'm currently
using the lotion by them not the body
butter because I go through these so
quickly I was using them day and night
and these aren't cheap so I'm gonna for
not comment I got the lotion for
everyday but these body creams are so
amazing if even the lotion is amazing as
well if you have super dry skin and if
it's just looking really dull this brand
I swear to you will bring it back to
life I have never tried a body lotion or
a body cream that has ever made my skin
looks so hydrated and feel hydrated at
the same time I absolutely love it I
can't say enough good things about this
brand and about the products that I've
tried from them okay last up we have
these velour lashes I've gone through
actually pull out three of these these
will last you about 20 times at least
for me they last me 20 times cuz after
about that much I kind of lose them or I
end up pulling out the lashes by
accident so about 20 times they last me
and
this is just one of the boxes I have
this one was either the girl you crazy
or the DA me UPS I'm currently wearing a
girl you crazy right now I just love
these lashes you guys they're so awesome
for the price you pay I mean it's a
great deal especially since you can
reuse them so much and I do have a
coupon code for you guys if you're
interested for 15% off and I'll leave
that below for you because if you're
gonna purchase a set of lashes
I definitely think velour is the way to
go the last thing I have this is Anasazi
up brow Wiz and brunettes I do love this
a lot I did purchase a couple more of
these just to have but right now I am
currently using these Sigma brow pencils
that they just came out with I've been
really loving them and I'm kind of
laying off of the brow is is just
because sometimes I feel like they pull
out my brow hairs I know some people
think that's crazy but they pull out one
sometimes so sometimes I like to take a
break from these and just go to
something different so right now I'm
using the Sigma ones and I love them
that's what I used to fill in my brows
today but these are really really nice
they look very natural and spoolie on
the end is pretty much the best bully of
life okay guys so that is it for this
price I've used that video I hope you
guys enjoyed it if you would like me to
continue to do these videos and then
just give it a thumbs up I will have
more makeup products for you guys in the
next one because I'm about to be out of
a lot of things right now thank you so
