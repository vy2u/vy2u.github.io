products I've used up I've kind of been
saving this for I think a month or two
maybe a little bit longer it's
definitely filled up so I wanted to go
ahead and show you guys and kind of get
rid of it and then just start saving up
other stuff let's get started the first
thing is this leanest pro skin shavers
or razors shaving razors I love these
usually I use mins razors because they
get closer and there you don't really
cut you as bad but if I do use a woman's
razor which I have in using this one
lately I have been loving it these are
the only women's razors i use i will not
use the other little disposable kind
because I cut myself so bad with those
things but this one I really love but
you have to like I have to switch out my
little razor top thing pretty often but
once the moisture strip starts going
away this is a lot easier for me to like
accidentally cut my leg like I come I
like today really really bad so I have
to get some new ones but otherwise I
really like this and I think it's a nice
little razor um anyways let's move on to
some dry shampoo so this is the dry
shampoo you can get this at walgreens
and I really liked it i like to announce
blonde i haven't used it since I dyed my
hair darker mainly because it's like a
really white dry shampoo so I don't want
to continue to use white in my hair to
make my roots look grey with dark hair
but if you have lighter hair then you
would really really like this cuz I
think it's the bomb and if you're
wondering what I use dry shampoo wise
for my dark hair then just check out my
December favorites I'll link it in the
bottom bar below next is this bio Tara
ultra moisture reconstructive
conditioner I got this whenever I dyed
my hair darker and I applied this after
I washed out all the hair dye or
whatever in the shower and I love this I
use the whole packet I know it's a lot
of product but I use the whole thing on
my hair and I love it made my hair super
super super soft so and this is only a
dollar salaries and its really really
great so definitely check that out at
two
of makeup remover wipes these are my two
favorite brands for makeup remover wipes
I'm not broken me out and they have not
like my my eyes hurt or anything so we
have the Neutrogena makeup remover
cleansing towelettes I love these guys
i've been using these a lot lately and
then we have the Leumi finland sensitive
touch these are awesome as well
especially if you have a really
sensitive skin or whatever these are the
ones you definitely want to try so and I
have like an allure best of beauty award
so that's awesome next is this mac brush
cleanser this is Bob I going I have some
in my little spray bottle back there
first spot cleaning but the whole thing
is gone I like this for spot cleaning
and I also liked it for when I'm washing
my brushes if I use them with powder
like my face brush like my powder brush
or my blush brush now I don't use my
foundation brush or my beauty blender
with this because it doesn't get the
liquid out as well it's like my dawn
dish detergent does so this is
definitely a product that you would want
to use on brushes that have been used by
powder not necessarily liquid stuff
because it doesn't really deep clean it
out that well so but I do like this
product of why I'm going to pick it up
again because i love it for spot
cleaning and it really really saves me
some time with cleaning my brushes to
have it to spot clean next is this soap
&amp;amp; Glory cleome sample of a creamy
moisture shower gel I really liked this
product I think it's great um it was
really moisturizing smells amazing just
like any soap &amp;amp; Glory product does and i
use this all up and i use it up real
quick to this wella professionals and
wrench enrich and they said a wrench 45
troll more hair moisturizing treatment I
got this in a glossybox a while back and
I couldn't tell a difference so so I
think about that next is this Nivea
touch of harmony cream oil body wash
with shea butter and vanilla blossom
scent this wasn't like anything special
it was cheap I think I think that's why
I bought it but it's really nothing that
special but that's what looks like I've
tried better I should say that now we
have a salon care 20 regular lift
volumizer this is what I used with my
hair dye so that's all gone and then i
have my this is my favorite brand at the
drugstore for like shampoo it's the
clear scalp &amp;amp; hair therapy for damage
and color repair holy cannoli i love
these two products there's another set
like the shea one don't get the shea
butter 1 don't even get it these are the
best i love them just the regular damage
therapy ones i mean they're awesome i
love this line so definitely check out
the clear line they're really really
good at like them and they're pretty
cheap too um then we have a CVS regular
instant polish remover I love these
kinds because they have the sponge in
them so i could just dip my finger in
and swirl it around and all paul show me
off before i know it so i love this i
gotta pick up another one this is just
the CVS brand nothing too crazy no we've
got more hair dye then we just have a
couple tubes of Herod I this is what I
use for my hair now the l'oreal
preference permanent hair color mega
browns chocolate level forward so you
can get these at Sally's and I really
like it so these are the colors I used
for my hair and that was the volumizer
too i used two bottles of color and a
whole volumizer for my hair now we have
the hydroxatone instant effect 92nd
wrinkle reducer i use this bad boy up
really quick i love this stuff i rave
about it so much i used to my past
videos and i ran out and i love it I'm
definitely trying other things for
underneath my eyes because you don't
want to use the same thing over and over
again but if I have to go back to it I
definitely
because it's awesome at like making you
look like you have no fine lines
underneath your eyes it's amazing then I
have a covergirl lash perfection mascara
because it's amazing and I use these
babies up all the time also i have the
maybelline dream matte powder in sand
medium a one this is all gone it's
totally dunzo so that's what it looks
like this is a great powder i love it i
do repurchase another one it's great for
if you have oily skin and you just kind
of want to blot your skin throughout the
day it's awesome I definitely recommend
it so go check this baby out and then
last but not least make up for ever
super matte loose powder and I used it
up so much I took the little sifter out
and I started using the whole bottle or
the whole jar so yeah this baby is
totally gone I loved it it was best
transparent powder ever which is why I
have another one on its way I'm using
other powers I'm just not really happy
with so I'm so happy and I'm ready for
it to be here it's definitely my
favorite loose transparent powder ever
literally makes you look flawless so
that was all of my trash I hope you
enjoyed this products I've used up video
if you did make sure you like it so I
can continue to save other products I've
used up and show you guys later on maybe
throughout the year and yeah so thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
