and hair look for prom and I absolutely
love the way that this came out the
makeup is something I feel like that can
go with a bunch of different dresses
it's pretty neutral so I think a lot of
people could wear this and I think this
day about the hair the hair is just fun
it's flirty and it just looks really
young and girly I did more just curls
and then I did like these little braids
kind of like peekaboo braids is what
I've been calling them so like little
peekaboo braids and I did one over here
and over here and then for the makeup
all the shades I'm using is from the
Smashbox masterclass 2 palette if you
guys want another prom makeup and hair
tutorial let me know because I want to
do an updo as well so like something
really easy that you can do at home
nothing like too crazy so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I do want to
quickly say please disregard my rosacea
in the beginning of this video because I
haven't put my cream on today I actually
have to go get the prescription so it's
super super red today when I do not have
that cream on my face literally like the
rosacea is ten times worse so just
excuse that and also we got to talk
about the hands my self-tanner it looks
like I have mittens on in a way but I
was cleaning bathtubs and I think that
the cleaner took off the self-tanner on
the bottom of my hands so that's why
there's like a distinct line so I hope
you guys enjoyed this don't forget to
give it a thumbs up if you would like
another prom makeup and hair look with
an updo and I will see you guys in my
next video
first off you want to start off with a
nice clean moisturized face and then
moving on and taking my NARS eyeshadow
primer and I'm going to be applying this
to my eyelids this really helps keep any
eyeshadow on all day long and it does
not crease on me and then I'll be taking
this Mac Paint Pot in soft ochre and I
like to use this to even out my lids I
do have a little bit of discoloration so
this just evens everything out and this
will also help the eyeshadow to adhere
to the lid so I'm going to put this
scotch tape on the back of my hand just
to get a little bit of the glue off and
then we want to be placing this
underneath my lower lashes angling up to
the end of my brow and I just decided to
do this because I was working with some
darker colors today I didn't really want
to use concealer so first off I'm taking
the color sable with a sigma e40 and I'm
going to be applying this on my lid and
my crease and a little bit above my
crease as well
next up I'll be taking the color
champagne with my Sigma e55 brush and
I'm just going to be applying this all
over my lid
and then to blend out those lines I will
be using the Sigma e-40 again with no
additional product on it
moving on to this color in the palette
is called mocha and I'm going to take a
Mac 217 this is a similar brush to these
Sigma e25 and I'm just going to be
applying this mocha shade in the outer V
and also into the crease as well
taking my e-40 again I'm going to just
eat blending this work out
next I'll be taking the color black out
with a smudger brush and I'm going to be
applying this on the outer V I'm so
sorry this is super blurry I do not know
what happened with my camera but it gets
better once I get to the part where I
start blending it out but I'm just going
to apply this in the outer V like I said
and a little bit into the crease I do
not want to go above the crease of this
I'm gonna go back in with that 217 that
we use and just blend this out
it's all about blending now I'm going
back in with that champagne color and
we're just going to touch up the lid and
then again go back in with the e-40 and
blend it out
then I'm just going back in with that to
17 and just touching up the darker
shadow as well and then we can go ahead
and take off the tape and you are left
with a really nice crisp line moving on
to primer I'm using the Too Faced primed
and poreless pure this is the oil-free
one and this is really nice if you have
oily skin and then for a foundation I'll
be using my Estee Lauder Double Wear
because I love this to cover up my
redness and to apply it I'm using the
Sigma f80 brush
this is a matte concealer palette and
it's in the color medium I'm gonna be
taking that middle shade and applying
this to my nose with my Mac stippling
brush because my nose does not hold
foundation very well so I like to apply
a little bit of that to kind of help
keep the color on there and now I'm
taking the Mac Pro Longwear concealer in
nw20 v and I'm just going to apply this
underneath my eyes and then blend it out
with D Sigma F 86 and as you'll see when
I'm blending this out I also dragged a
little bit onto my chin and my forehead
to highlight
now it's really important to set your
concealer so I'm using my makeup forever
super matte loose powder you can use
whatever translucent powder that you
have and you just make want to make sure
you set that concealer so it doesn't
crease or move throughout the night and
then to set my face makeup I will be
using the Maybelline Dream matte powder
which is one of my favorites I'm sad
that they discontinued this because it's
literally the best drugstore powder ever
made so I'm kind of disappointed about
that moving on to contour I'm using my
benefit hoola bronzer and my NARS eita
brush and I will put my contour video
down below so you can check that out and
I talked a little bit more in depth
about what I'm doing but I figured I
would just go ahead and speed right
through this process because this is a
pretty long video
for blush I'm using one of my favorite
blushes this is the Sigma blush in
mellow and it is so beautiful it's just
a gorgeous neutral blush goes with
pretty much any look and I love it so
I'll be applying it with my blush brush
from Sigma and then I'll go in and blend
it out with the duo fiber
to highlight I'm taking this Becca
highlighter in moonstone and I'm just
going to be applying this to the tops of
my cheekbones above my brows down the
center of my nose and also on my Cupid's
bow
taking this Milani brow wax I'm just
going to apply this over my brows so
that they stay in place all night and
then on top of that I'll be using my
Tarte Amazonian clay brow mousse in
taupe and I really love this stuff it
stays all day and it doesn't go anywhere
so it's perfect if you want your brows
to last all night long
after that I'm just going to set my
brows in place with this anastacio
tinted brow gel in brunette and I find
that this also helps my brows look a
little bit more natural
moving on to liquid liner I forgot to
show a clip of this but I'm just using
the Loreal super slim eyeliner in black
I show this in almost all of my recent
tutorials I absolutely love this and I
am going to be doing a winged eyeliner
just because I think it's really
flattering with this look
and then to clean up the edges and make
it look a little bit more sharp I'm
going to take some concealer and just
swipe it right at the edge of that
eyeliner and blend it in with my finger
aligning my upper and lower waterline
with this NARS eyeliner in Via Veneto
this is just a nice black eyeliner I'm
curling my lashes and I'm going to apply
these velour lashes and girl you crazy
and this makes the look I absolutely
love these lashes so going back in with
that mocha shade I'm going to take a
pencil brush and apply this underneath
my lower lashes just to really smoke out
and complete this look then take an e25
from sigma and further going to blend
this out
now I'm going to be taking the color
vanilla from the pallet and I'm going to
be highlighting with this if I could go
back I would get a different highlight
something that's a little bit more
pigmented and that shows a lot more but
this color works if you have the pallet
after that I'm just going back in with
my liner and touching up then I'm taking
my Clinique bottom lash mascara and I'm
just going to apply this all over my
bottom lashes and this is great as well
I find that it's kind of waterproof like
it does not come off and then I'm taking
my Becca highlighter again and I'm going
to be highlighting the inner tear-duct
of my eye just to brighten that inner
corner now for your mouth I definitely
recommend whitening your teeth so if
you're going to prom and you want
something to whiten your teeth
I'll leave my favorite products down
below because I do have coupon codes for
them and what I'm gonna do is line my
lips with my Jordana lipliner and this
is in the color tawny
and then for today's lipstick I wanted
to go with a nude but nothing too nude
because I don't want to completely wash
out the lips so this is wet and wild
Fergie daily it's a really gorgeous
darker nude it's a little bit darker
than it looks on camera then taking this
NARS lip gloss it's my new favorite
gloss it is so pretty I can't pronounce
the name so I'll leave it down below but
it looks gorgeous with this look I
absolutely love the lip color and then
that is it for the makeup pretty simple
and really easy to do so now we're gonna
go ahead and move on to hair now for
this hairstyle I am using my Bellamy
hair extensions and I just purchased
these not too long ago and I've been
waiting to use them I need to go get
mine cut but I really wanted to use them
in this tutorial today so we're only
using three clips today I'm using the
two clip first so I just sectioned the
bottom half of my hair and clipped those
in then you just want to section above
that clip and put in a three clip weft
and then above this you want to section
it off again and put in a four clip weft
and this just gives me a lot of volume
and I love the extensions I would have
used all of them if I had them cut right
but for now I'm just going to go ahead
and use these three wefts and it gives
me the desired volume that I want taking
this new me at twenty five millimeter
one as always I always have coupon codes
for new me so I'll have those listed
down below and this parts really simple
you're just going to take a section
that's about an inch thick and just wrap
it around the wand all of the curls are
going to be away from your face and
that's pretty much all you're doing for
this part super simple so that's why I
kind of skipped over this part
so again just away from your face make
sure your barrel is behind your hair and
then hold it for a few seconds and let
it go now after you're done curling one
side I recommend spraying it with a hair
spray I love this Loreal Elnett
hairspray because you can put it in your
hair and it's not crunchy and you can
still brush through it if you need to
brush through it or run your fingers
through your hair
so it's by far my favorite one and that
is all of the hair curled now keep in
mind you can totally leave your hair
like this it's stunning I mean you can
never go wrong with classic curls for
prom but I figured we could spice it up
a little bit for this video so I'm
taking this little section right here in
the front and I'm going to clip this
back and I'm going to take the section
right behind it and we're going to be
braiding this down this is how big of a
section I have and really easy I'm just
going to start braiding it I only add in
hair one time and then I just braid it
all the way down to the bottom so you
can see here this is where I'm adding
the hair and this is the only time that
I added the hair in this braid and then
I just braid it on down
after you've got it braided we're going
to take that little piece and just flip
it over that braid and it kind of makes
it hang really pretty and I'm just going
to pin this braid towards the back of my
head and you want to make sure you hide
the bobby pins while doing this so make
sure your hair in the back can go over
those bobby pins just to hide everything
and now we're gonna be adding just some
peekaboo braids so I'm just taking
random strands of hair now you can do
this all over your head you could have a
ton of different braids but I just added
three in the front I would probably add
two more in the back if you had someone
with you that could do it for you and I
would recommend using these black
elastics if you have dark hair and of
course if you have blond hair I would
use the clear elastics so you can see
I'm just picking random sections and
doing little small braids and I don't
ride them all the way down I leave about
three inches of the hair curled and then
I tie it up
and then this is what you should be left
with I think it's super cute just to
have little braids like that poke
through
and on this side we're going to be
taking section about this big and I'm
doing it behind my bangs because I
didn't want to put my bangs back for
this video and I'm just going to be
braiding this I didn't add any extra
hair to this braid I just went ahead and
braided it all the way down
after you've got that done you're just
gonna want to again pin this to towards
the back of your head and also
camouflage the bobby pins with your hair
and also I'm pulling it out just to give
it a little bit more of a relaxed feel
and again we're just going to be adding
little braids throughout the hair so I'm
gonna go ahead and show you guys me
doing that
and then after you've done your small
braids you are pretty much done I would
just recommend setting it in place with
some hairspray and you are good to go
it's just a fun way to kind of amp up
the regular curled hair that everybody
does so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video please give it a thumbs up if you
did like it and I will see you guys in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
