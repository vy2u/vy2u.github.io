hi guys so today's video is going to be
another problem and makeup tutorial I'm
really excited about this one because I
feel like a ton of people can wear this
but their dresses and a ton of people
can do this makeup look because it's
pretty simple to do and I absolutely
love that we're using basic neutral
shadows just a cream shade a medium
brown and a darker Brown and I am using
the ones from the lorac Pro palette feel
free to use any shadow that you have in
your collection that could be around
these shades because you will still get
the same effect if you use the technique
that I show you in the video and I just
used some liner on my bottom lash line
and then a more pink lip I love that eye
shadow I just think they look super
seamless and beautiful so I hope you
guys enjoyed this prom look if you want
to see my last prom makeup tutorial I
want to leave it down below for you guys
to check out I will have a complete
drugstore prom makeup look coming to you
very very soon I'm still kind of picking
out a couple different things but I will
have free guys and I will be doing an
updo and also probably another hair
tutorial just for prom it's just really
fun to get glammed up so I hope you all
enjoyed this video if you do like it
don't forget to give it a thumbs up and
share it on your Pinterest Facebook
anything like that to help out any other
girls that maybe are looking for another
prom look and yeah thank you guys so
much for watching and I will see you all
in my next video bye okay so first off
we're obviously gonna prime our eyes I'm
using my regular primers I'll have them
linked down below I definitely recommend
priming your eyes with whatever you
prefer it's just gonna help your
eyeshadow stay on all night and not
crease
going in with some scotch tape I'm just
going to be putting this on the edge of
my eye so I can get a nice sharp line I
quickly do want to say that I have been
suffering from a dry scalp so please be
nice to me I can't seem to help my dry
scalp so if you have any suggestions
please let me know down below but right
now I'm going to go ahead and take taupe
from the lorac Pro palette with the
Sigma e-40 and I'm going to be blending
this into my crease and also dragging it
a little bit on the lid and a little bit
above the crease as well
now I'm going to be taking cream from
the palette and I'm just going to be
applying this all over my lid because I
really want a nice light lid for this
look
now I'm gonna take that same blending
brush and just blend that white
eyeshadow that got a little bit above
the crease I'm not dragging this on the
lid or anything I'm just making sure the
brush stays above the crease so I can
blend out those lines
now I'm going to be taking sable from
the Lark co-pilots is definitely my
favorite brown color in the palette with
a Mac 217 you could also use a sigma e25
I'm focusing this in the outer V of my
eye I don't really want to bring this on
to the lid too far I do want to blend it
on there but I don't want to drag a ton
of color on my lid but I am going to be
dragging this color a little bit in to
the crease not too much though just
whatever is left over on your brush go
ahead and drag that into your crease but
like I said you mainly want to focus
this on the outer V and just really
deepening that part up
going back in with cream I'm just going
to be touching up my lid
and then of course going in and blending
out any of the cream shade that got into
the crease now I'm going to go ahead and
take off the tape you guys can see my
rosacea is crazy today I just got a new
prescription because my other one was
making my rosacea pretty bad so
hopefully we can get a winner with this
new one but first off I'm going to go
ahead and apply my foundations since I
already have my primer on I'm using the
Estee Lauder and Lancome mixed because I
needed a darker shade but it still was a
little bit too light but at the end it
all looks fine I would not recommend the
Estee Lauder if you are going to be
taking pictures I'm just using it for
this video because I really need my
redness covered up but any a foundation
that does not have SPF that would be
your go-to for prom and any special
events just because you won't have a
white cast in photos now I'm taking this
NARS concealer is the radiant creamy
concealer in the color medium custard
and I'm just gonna be concealing
underneath my eyes then also dragging it
on my chin upper lip and a little bit on
my nose and I will be blending that out
with my Sigma F 86 brush
now I'm gonna be taking my foundation
brush and just blending out any edges
that I feel like need to be blended out
I'm just gonna set my under eyes with
the makeup forever super matte loose
powder and then for my face makeup I'll
be taking the L'Oreal True Match powder
I just love these two together I think
they give a nice flawless finish and
then for contouring I will be using my
benefit bronzer in hoola and my NARS
eita brush and like I said in my last
video I will leave a detailed contouring
and highlighting video for you guys down
below it does take a little bit of time
to do this
now I'm going in with Max Melba and I'm
just going to be applying this to my
cheeks it is a nice matte to blush and
this blush pretty much goes with
everything as well so it's great for
this look then I'm just going to go
ahead and blend out with my duo fiber
brush taking this Becca highlighter in
opal I'm going to be highlighting the
tops of my cheekbones I love this
highlighter especially with this look
and then I'm gonna contour my nose I
meant to do this when I was contouring
but I forgot so I went ahead and did
this now taking my Tarte brow mousse in
taupe I will be filling in my brows per
usual
then I'm gonna set them in place with
his Anastacio brow gel in brunette
going in with that cream shade again I
am going to be putting this in the inner
corner and also dragging it up towards
the lid as well and then of course I
blend a lot so I am blending my shadow
once again because I just am obsessive
and have to blend my shadow all the time
taking the Kat Von D liner I'm just
going to go ahead and line my eyes and
then I'm going to line my upper
waterline with this NARS
larger-than-life eyeliner in via veneto
then curling our lashes in applying
mascara I just applied the L'Oreal
telescopic to my lashes I'm going to be
applying false lashes today and they are
the velour doll me up lashes I think
these are so pretty and flirty so I
think they're great for prom after
applying lashes I'm going to go in with
that sable color again and just touch up
the outer V and really deepen up the
look I want it to be nice and light on
the lid and then darker in the outer V
and a little bit in the crease
then going in with a clean blending
brush I'm just going to blend out the
work that I just did going back in with
cream I'm going to be highlighting
underneath my brow bone and then taking
that same eyeliner I'm going to be
lining my waterline I'm gonna take it
bout to the center of my waterline and
then I'm also going to put this
underneath my lower lash line and I'm
just gonna stop in the middle of my eye
and then taking a pencil brush I will
just be blending this out I noticed that
this black eyeliner when I use it on my
lower lash line it looks blue so if you
want to go with a blue eyeliner totally
do it and then I'm going back in with
cream and just putting more into the
tear duct and also blending it kinda
into that liner that we just put on
taking a Jordana lip liner in tawny I
will be lining my lips today I think
it's very important to line your lips
for a dramatic look so you can have a
nice outline and your lips don't kind of
get washed away in your makeup then
taking this Milani lipstick and nude
cream it's more of a pink color so I'm
just going to be applying that today you
can honestly use any lip color with this
look that you wanted and then with the
maybelline color elixir and petal plush
I will be applying this to my lips and
then you are done so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you in my next one
