showing you how to get this makeup look
it actually only took me 13 minutes and
40 seconds sets out 40 seconds seconds
14 minutes and 47 seconds to get this
full look and I was still finding
products while I was filming this
because I was like crap where do I put
it I couldn't find some things this is a
really quick and easy look to do
everything is drugstore the brushes the
makeup everything used is drugstore I
really wanted to do like a drugstore
makeup and drugstore brushes video
especially with something like this to
show you how you can use different
brushes for multi different purposes for
instance just because something says
contour brush it doesn't mean that you
have to use it for contour you can use
it for highlighter you can use it to set
your under eyes do whatever you want
with the brushes that you have I'm also
thinking about doing a drugstore and
makeup favorites and brushes included if
you guys want to see the drugstore
favorites with makeup and brushes give
this video a thumbs up and leave a
comment down below letting me know also
tell me some of your favorite drugstore
products I've been having such a hard
time with like drugstore foundations
I've tried a few and they're just so bad
and I end up always going back to the
L'Oreal Lumi cushion so if you want to
see how to get this makeup look in under
15 minutes then let's just go ahead and
get started
okay so we're going to go ahead and
start our timer and I'm going to use the
Nivea men post shave balm this isn't
going to help control your oil but your
makeup does set really nicely on this
and lasts for a long period of time and
I'm going to use the L'Oreal Lumi
cushion and I'm going to press this into
the skin using the sponge that it comes
with this foundation is a little too
light for me and I couldn't find a
darker one in store so let me know down
below if you have a hard time finding a
darker foundation with this line because
I didn't really see one but that Nivea
shave balm going back to that I just
wanted to show you guys that because it
is a great alternative because I haven't
found a drugstore primer that I really
love
now I'm freaking out because I can't
find my concealer and I found it if this
is the wet and wild illuminating
concealer I use this shade posing nude
and I'm just gonna do what I normally do
with my concealer and put it underneath
my eyes and down the center of my face
just to brighten this look up and
highlight these areas I'm also using a
real technique brush just to pull in
this out you'll see this brush quite a
few times in this video because I just
love it it's a great multi-purpose brush
then what I'm going to do is take a real
techniques brush this is just a little
bit smaller one and I'm going to put out
and I'm going to blend out the concealer
on my lids and then I'm taking this Ulta
pressed powder again with that brush I
did wipe off any excess concealer before
I did this and I'm just using that
powder to set my face and some people
might not like to go in with the same
brush they used for liquid products but
honestly when you're in a rush it
doesn't even matter then I'm going in
with my glam bronze bronzer and I'm
going to use this to bronze my forehead
I am using an MUA brush this I actually
got from CVS and it's a great duo fiber
brush I highly recommend it
I can barely tell the difference between
my Sigma so don't at least one in this
one because honestly it has the best
quality ever I love this brush so I'm
just gonna go ahead and bronze my face
with this and then I'll go back in with
a real techniques contour brush and I'm
going to contour my cheekbones and also
a little bit under my bottom lip
and I couldn't find a way to keep my
phone like going without going black so
I had to keep checking every couple
times so I was like good seven minutes
we're okay
now I'm using this wet and wild blush
and we're going to put this on my cheeks
with that same brush this is actually a
really great blush brush it like sits
right on the cheekbone and then I'm
going to take a stippling brush that
same one we just use and blend this out
watch HD booth now for highlighter I'm
going to use this new one from Wet n
Wild and I do really like it this was
the lightest shade that they had I kind
of wish they had a one more lighter
shade because I didn't get the darker
one but it is a really nice highlighter
for spring and summer time and it's very
very pigmented going back on that
bronzer I'm going to take this lab brush
I believe I got this from Walmart but I
definitely got it from a drugstore and
I'm just going to take that bronzer
again and use this into my crease you
can use any products any way you want
you can use blush on your eyes bronzer
on your eyes highlighter you know
whatever you have
going in with this essence gel liner I
couldn't find a black one so I just used
this blue one to tightline which means
I'm lined my upper waterline and then I
had to check time again and I was pretty
pumped about the fact that it was only
10 minutes and 30 seconds using this
L'Oreal miss mango rock mascara I lovely
miss manga line I liked the original one
and this one I'm going to go ahead and
coat my lashes and it gave me so much
volume I only apply mascara to my top
lashes when I'm doing such a natural
look because I find that my bottom
lashes are so long that sometimes it
overpowers the whole thing then I'm
taking this Ulta brow tint and deep I
definitely need a lighter shade of this
but you can just see how awesome this is
at filling in your brows this is a great
dupe for the benefit give me brow I mean
it is absolutely amazing you have to try
it out I know for me I don't like to
like focus on my brows every single day
so that's kind of like the perfect
product for me and then I'm going to
take that highlighter and go underneath
my brows and in the inner corners of my
eyes just to add a little extra pop
finally for lips I'm going to go ahead
and take this makeup revolution gloss
and I'm going to leave everything down
below but this is a great gloss just to
put on it's kind of like your lip color
but better it's a really nice gloss it's
not sticky or anything like that and you
don't have to use a lip liner with it
and then to finish off everything I'm
taking this drew barrymore this is
actually from Walmart from her flower
collection and I'm using the banana
powder from Ulta again and just setting
my whole face and then you are done with
this look so I hope you guys enjoyed
