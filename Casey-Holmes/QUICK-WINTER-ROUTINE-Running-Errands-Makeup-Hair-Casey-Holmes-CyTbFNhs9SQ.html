share with you like my weekend running
errands look it's a pretty quick and
easy thing to do it's like one of my
go-to looks if I want to look put
together this is what I go for
and for my hair like I like it smooth I
don't want it to be chi or anything like
that I just want something glamorous but
in a nonchalant way you know what I
usually focus when I'm running errands I
focus more on my hair because I do like
to have curls in my hair on days when I
don't really have a lot of makeup that's
just like one of my favorite things to
do and then of course I did a lighter
makeup look using some different
products that you guys haven't seen at
least one of them two maybe two products
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video don't forget to go ahead and give
it a thumbs up if you liked it thank you
so much for all the thumbs ups lately I
really appreciate it you want to see how
I completed myself from like literally
shower to now then let's just go ahead
and get started okay so the first thing
I'm gonna do is go ahead and hop in the
shower and if you guys want to know what
shampoos and conditioners I use I will
leave them down below if you want to
check them out so after I get out of the
shower I'm going to towel dry my hair
just a little bit and I'm going to then
brush it out with a detangler brush and
I like to start from the bottom of my
hair and work my way up and I make funny
faces whenever I do this because I'm so
tender-headed that I just I hate
brushing my hair I'm gonna take the
revery milk it's an anti frizz leave-in
nourishing treatment and this is great
because I know when I let my hair air
dry and I like go to bed or something it
gets so frizzy and just all over the
place so this really helps keep all my
flyaways and frizz tamed and then I'm
using the bumble and bumble don't blow
it and I love a bumble and bumble it's
one of my favorite brands and I don't
have a lot of texture to my hair and as
I as you can see it's pretty straight
even when it dries it dries straight but
this adds a little bit more texture and
one of the things that is trending at
Sephora is a model off-duty hair which
is so easy to recreate and I'm gonna
show you guys how to do it today I'm
going to use this one it is the GHD
curve the classic
I earn it's a one inch and I'm not gonna
use the clamp today I'm just gonna wrap
my hair around the barrel and I'm gonna
use big and small sections nothing
really precise or anything like that but
I'm also going to leave the ends
straight so you can see I'm leaving like
one or two inches out and quick tip this
is gonna make your hair look a little
bit longer so if you don't like the way
your hair looks shorter after you curl
it leaving some hair out will make it
look a little bit longer and you don't
have to leave your hair on the curling
wand too long at all because you just
want these really gorgeous loose
effortless waves okay so I'm gonna let
my hair sit and then I'm gonna move on
to foundation I'm using this buxom
weightless foundation I believe it gives
me a nice coverage when I put concealer
on and it's really light and something
easy for everyday or just running
errands and then I'm using the naked
skin by urban decay concealer and I'm
going to put this underneath my eyes
this will also help cover up some of the
redness and I'm just going to put that
in the center of my face and under my
brows and excuse me and then I'm gonna
set my concealer with these Smashbox
palette the yellow powder and then
bronze it with this palette as well this
is a really simple makeup look so it's
like really easy
I'm gonna use my Clinique brow gel and
then my benefit roller lash and the
Urban Decay lip gloss in lier which is
one of my absolute favorites it is so
pretty for everyday and just by itself
and then after that I'm just gonna go
ahead and brush out these curls to
loosen them up a little bit and keep in
mind that the curls will fall as well
throughout the day and then I'm gonna go
ahead and put in this verb ghost oil I
put about two to three drops in my hand
and rub it together and put it in my
hair where I feel like it needs a little
more shine and to be a little more
smooth and as you guys try out this
hairstyle let me know it's super easy to
recreate and you can hashtag it at
trending at Sephora and I would love to
see it I'll go check out some of your
hairstyles because like I said this is
go easy and pretty right okay guys so
that is it I hope you enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you all in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
