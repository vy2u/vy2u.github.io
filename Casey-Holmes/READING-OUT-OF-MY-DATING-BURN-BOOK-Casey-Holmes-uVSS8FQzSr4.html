video in this well fog stress because I
just filmed a talk through video for
this makeup look I tried out some
different products and it should be up
before this one
they also want to film a QA for you guys
because I'm gonna be kind of busy these
next couple weeks because someone's
coming into town and I kind of want to
spend a lot of time with them so yeah
I'm just like pre filming some videos
for you guys so you have some things to
watch but I asked you guys on on
Instagram for some questions and thank
you so much for all of the questions Wow
I mean there's there's a lot of
questions I told you guys you know ask
whatever I'm always like off limits you
know I don't care do what you want to do
and I'm just going to go through I have
not looked at these and just to find
some I'm loading them or right now oh by
the way if you're wondering I am wearing
my foxy locks extensions which I
mentioned in that video but I'm obsessed
with them because I cut them to my
linked and I feel like this length is
like my length like I don't need to go
longer than this I really love them so
if you want to check out the extensions
I'm wearing I'll leave all the
information down below as well as like
jewelry and what I'm wearing um this
wild fox dress I'll leave it all down
below
Alexis Rae asked the first time we split
the night with a guy first true
boyfriend also where's the best place to
find jeans for a booty my packs and
jeans aren't holding any more the first
time I spent the night with a guy was oh
I was a little young I knew I was able
to drive so I was probably like 16 or 17
wait did I spend the night whenever I
know like when I first started spending
the night with guys like I wouldn't go
to sleep just because I was like so
nervous I don't know is anybody was
anybody else like that I think it was
like 17 never slept with them but I did
stay over 4 and night when I was younger
so yeah first real boyfriend I mentioned
this one in my last Q&amp;amp;A but it was my ex
from the best place to find jeans for a
booty I feel like forever 21 does have
quite a few genes for girls with booties
I've always said American Eagle has
genes for girls with a badonkadonk
I feel like American Eagle is made for
girls with butts I like a gene company
called I think it's called Joe's jeez I
can't remember I will put it right here
I'm obsessed with these jeans they are
pricey but they are amazing and I I love
them I stopped up last time I was there
and I don't have to go for like honestly
like a few years because they're under
warranty and also other stuff I even got
a pair of white jeans that are like
distressed but they have this special
coating on them that if you spill
something it just goes right off like
they don't stain which is like a dream
for white jeans so they have really nice
jeans too for if you have a butt because
they fit really nicely around the legs
and everything so like I said I'll leave
the name up here and it will also leave
it down below cuz I love them I go to
the one and I go to the store in Phipps
Plaza if you live in ATL I love it's
Plaza it's kind of intimidating because
everybody's like so serious and that
mall because it's like super high-end
and everybody's like all you know
serious but I really love that mall and
that's where I found mine Adria Deanna
asked have you kissed on first date yes
I I'm the type of person that will kiss
on a first date just because I feel like
that's like okay yes conversation stuff
is obviously where the spark is you know
you have to see if you have things in
common with them but a kiss means a lot
like if you can't kiss I'm gonna date
you you know same things I always kiss
on the first day if I'm feeling it if
I'm not feeling it the date with like
super rough I will not kiss you but I
will kiss on a first date because I
think it's really important you got to
test the waters right briefly Belle
asked how many days you work out how
long and how long did it actually take
to see a difference as most of you know
I have been like on a workout binge I
mean such a huge binge
I honestly work at about six days a week
and I go to my trainer four days out of
the week and I work out with him I go in
there from 12:00 until wait what time
doing weather yeah twelve
so about 12:40 I work out with him but I
don't leave until like 1:30 - because
I'll do my cardio and then I'll do my ab
workouts which I do do a ton of ab stuff
and then I will also do like 20 minutes
of cardio or whatever he has me doing
for the day and then when I'm there by
myself on those other two days I just
strictly do cardio and abs I would say
three weeks to see a difference and
that's with diet exercise and just
working my ass off because I've really
worked my butt off but I'm I'm at the
point in this whole workout thing where
I'm addicted and I don't want to stop
going that's why I go six days a week
I'll go seven days a week just because
I'm like I want to walk I want to burn
off all of this vodka that I just drank
over the weekend you know I'm saying
Samantha do Belle asked how do you stay
confident even when a guy you really
thought you liked it turns out to be an
F boy you seem so positive and sure of
yourself all the time you inspire me so
much love you wish we could be FS well
Thank You Samantha I love you too quick
story I don't know if I ever told you
guys this story but there was this one
guy that I was so obsessed with liked
him so much it was the first guy after
my breakup that I was just like yes this
guy is so amazing and he did so much for
me I think I have talked about him
because I remember saying that line but
anyways he was so amazing and I talked
to him for months
and he cut me off and he literally just
cut me off because I wanted a
relationship after talking to him for
all of these months and he didn't want
that and I was so I was really taken
back and kind of like heartbroken by
which is really weird because I mean we
weren't even technically dating but I
feel like I'm a Sagittarius so I just I
put my heart into everything and when I
like somebody I like them a lot and I
because it takes a lot for me to like
somebody you have to really fit the
criteria for me to like you be like
really did kind of break my heart I'm
not gonna lie and one of the biggest
things that I can say is just know that
that's not the last guy out there I had
to really sit down and kind of let those
feelings out so I kind of cried a little
bit and I never cry so I got a good cry
out and then I was like you know what
I'm just gonna go back and do my same
thing that I've been doing and I promise
you there's so much better guys out
there and this guy he was an F boy he
completely is like I think he's he's
okay as a friend but he would never date
him ever ever ever ever after all that
so just know there's more guys out there
I am talking to someone that I'm like
just so smitten by right now that I
never this person if it all works out I
will tell you guys the story of how we
met because it just it it wasn't in the
put it wasn't in the plan for either of
us that we weren't expecting to be each
other but I'm so smitten by him the
whole moral of that and the whole reason
why I just say that is because when you
least expect it somebody will come into
your life and just sweep you off your
feet
and you won't even realize it and don't
worry about the guys that take you
through hell because I had a good couple
of those as last year that just like
really tore me down
just stay confident within yourself keep
doing what you're doing and don't expect
anything because I've always said it
when you least expect it something will
happen and somebody will just walk into
your life
jen taylor s where do you see yourself
in five years
total IV 29 almost because november I'm
turning 24 so I almost be 29 I'll be 28
29 and I see myself hopefully hopefully
engaged I'm not gonna lie hopefully I'll
be engaged by then and if not married
and hopefully my business is perking
perking know hopefully whatever business
I'm in is just peeking up and doing
really well I only see myself succeeding
in life so hopefully my business is
doing really really well
because I don't know exactly what I'll
be doing but I know something hopefully
with social media and marketing and
something like that because I love it I
love being in front of the camera too so
I mean even like a talk show could you
imagine me with a talk show that'd be so
fun I definitely would be married I
don't think I would want kids yet
because I don't know I don't know if I
want kids yet but hopefully hopefully
somebody will want to marry me but I'm
22 anything oh God haha Gina key I'm
sorry if I said that wrong she said what
is your most Awkward hookup story we've
all got one girl no shame okay just hook
up mean sexual or making out I'm gonna
do making out because I've never really
had like a sexual one enough alike so um
making out what's the most awkward
makeout I've had somebody I feel like
they're in front of you I feel like the
most awkward kissing experiences that
you can have are the ones where you're
in the moment and you just you don't
want to do it you know what I'm saying
like and it's just or they're like
they're like really really bad and it's
like they're so
this is so bad that I'm talk about this
online they're so bad that they think
they're like so good and it's just
something that you you you don't want to
be mean people that just I think just
the most awkward hookups are the ones
that think that they they do so well and
it's just it's not bad it's really bad
cf8 one asks do you care if a guy makes
less money than you absolutely not
absolutely not
I don't money does not make a
relationship and money does not create a
lifetime of happiness and I don't care I
think I'm more worried about guys being
intimidated by me and like that's the
success I've had this not supposed to
sound like really cocky or anything it's
not supposed unlike that but for my age
I feel like I'm doing very well with a
house and my cars and things like that
and living on my own for a while now I
feel like it's really hard to find a guy
that's not intimidated by that I feel
like it found one that's not intimidated
but some of the guys I've dated in the
past are really intimidated by it or
they expect you to pay for everything
so I mean I'm not all about the pain for
everything thing I've already done that
and don't want to do that again don't
get me wrong I don't like a guy paying
for every single little thing but I mean
if I've got to pay for everything
no because I'm the type of person where
I'm your girlfriend I will want homeside
moving the camera I'm the type of
girlfriend what I will surprise my
boyfriend presents like randomly I'll go
buy him a t-shirt if I'm not shopping in
something reminds me of him I'll buy it
for him and I'll get to him just as a
gift just because I was thinking about
him in that time that's the kind of
girlfriend I am I don't expect a guy to
I don't expect again to make more than
me at all I just I just don't mind to be
intimidated by me you know to me and I
don't want them to expect to have to buy
me gifts just because I buy them
something cuz I'm thinking about them
kaylynn and asked is it hard for you to
make girlfriends I get along better with
guys rather than girls but I find myself
lonely at times where I wish I could
just call up a girl just real friend to
go you pedis with by the way I've been a
new in a new city for about a year what
is your in tank I'll make a new girl
friends I will just tell you about this
today um
I have a couple good girlfriends
actually I have a lot of good
girlfriends but a lot of them I don't
hang out with because they either have a
boyfriend or you know we're just not
like that you know what I mean but I
have a hell of a lot of guy friends and
that I don't know it is something about
guys there's just is so easy to get
along with them I do not make out with
every single one of them and I do not
sleep with them so don't get it twisted
they are all my friends and they're all
friend-zoned okay they are all
friendzone but I love them and I think
with girls though like I'm the type of
person where I'll go out and I will talk
to girls non-stop because I want to make
more girlfriends I think girlfriends are
a lot of fun and I really I really enjoy
girlfriends but some of these girls are
just so caddie that it's like you can't
be friends with them I think just be
outgoing and talk to a girl if you see
her and that's what I like to do I
usually introduce myself
and I'm not gonna lie but one of my best
guy friends Justin told me that some of
these girls that I meet out when we go
out in public don't like give me this
look or they'll talk about me and then I
keep talking to them and hanging out
with him throughout the night at the end
of the night they're like hey I like
that Casey girl she's nice and like yeah
if you weren't so rude you would have
known that off the very beginning just
going to meeting a girl with an open
mind and because I think a lot of girls
just once they have their little clique
they kind of like to stay there um but
just create conversation and see if you
have anything in common and usually it
can stem from there and it to be quite
honest to do a few drinks helps the lobe
is o CN also asked please read from your
diary oh please let me go get it by the
way this is the burn book for F boys and
Rose knows it's coming because she just
grunted but this is the burn book for F
boys and I have you actually wrote this
in a while but I need to get back into
it because I remember all these
experiences anyways let me go get it
hold on okay so this is it and I have
written so much in here like I would
love to make this a book because my
experience is I feel like are hilarious
so just what I've written so far let's
just pick a page
shall we oh no these are these such good
bugs okay
okay I'm gonna read a little bit okay so
I'm reading from this page my camera
just shut off so no workshop at so don't
judge me okay let's read one night train
and I went out and she couldn't stay
long we both drank a little I drink more
since I wasn't planning on leaving and I
honestly had no one to hang out with
since she left I ended up just going to
blank I'm not saying the name and
getting a water and some pretzels to try
and help sober me up okay let's be real
I just wanted to say because blank was
working everything was going really well
between us and mine is the bike I can't
get my way oh I can't give away all this
I ever write a book on this stuff you
all know my blanks but right now you
need to know that they've like uh-huh
as I sat down at his bar trying to sober
up blank and I would just have a random
like and I would just have random
conversations at first like normal and
then one tall dark semi handsome guy
came up to me and started to create a
conversation what's a pretty girl like
you doing up here at the bar by herself
classic one-liner not my type but I was
by myself and I wanted to have a
conversation not to mention I wanted to
show blank that he wasn't the only one
who could get attention around here he
needed to see that other people were
interested in me
and I can make God in an instant so I
played along okay so I'm gonna leave
that that let me know if you guys are
interested in hearing more things from
here it's just it's just it's just one
of those things that would be such a
great book and I'm working I need to get
back to riding in this because I really
miss it there's so much that's happening
so let me know what you think in the
comments tarah boo I'm sorry to answer
one from her but I'm gonna answer this
one and she said do you think it's weird
to make the first move as a girl have
you ever been only got have you ever
been the first to ask a guy out on a
date I've never been the first to asked
a guy out on a date but I was the first
one to kiss a boy
it goes along with my story with how I
met this person I'm talking to now but
um we were like sitting there and I was
so attracted to him but I couldn't tell
if he liked me or not
and I was like man
like this guy so much I don't know what
to do and we were just sitting there
talking and I just like enjoyed his
company so much and I just leaned in and
I kissed him I was thinking to myself
before I went in kissed him I was like
well if you just like me he's gonna tell
me and he's just we're gonna know within
this kiss and I kissed him and he was
like I have been waiting to do that all
night knows like II yeah don't be scared
to like take the first plunge with
things I mean I would probably ask
somebody on a date if they weren't
asking me yet I mean if they say no they
say no you know what I mean so if you
definitely learn from this last time to
take chances because if you don't take
chances you'll never know what the
outcome is so you do a girl you ask that
guy on the date or you kiss them you do
whatever you want to do right off the
bat I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching don't
forget to let me know if you would like
to see this baby more in videos Meiri
from it it's some of it's a long
embarrassing I'm of course going to use
blanks because the only time I would
ever expose the blanks was if I made it
into a book and then I would put all my
business out there
