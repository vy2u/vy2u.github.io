sharing it with you my room tour and I'm
so excited it's my favorite room in the
house and like I mentioned to you guys
before I'm just not quite ready for a
house tour yet so I like to do so I like
to do tours of each room I just did a
beauty room tour last month so if you
haven't checked it out I will link it
down below but I also wanted to let you
guys know that I am gonna sell a couple
things in my closet unvented bended is
one of my favorite apps because they
filter their items by brands so if I
want to like look up Free People stuff I
can just click free people and it has
all of the listings and all of the codes
are either just gently used or still
have the tags on them I know I'm not the
only one that finds clothes with tags on
them in their closet like you know it's
just a bad habit some of us have and
sometimes we just forget about them so
my kind of role is if I've had it in
there for two months and I still haven't
used it it's time to sell it or get rid
of it finding the best way to kind of do
your spring cleaning and also make some
money is just put a couple things on an
app and of course the more you post the
more money you're gonna make so all you
let go night-night
you tired so if you want to see the
items that I put on vintage I will leave
it to any description box below I hope
you guys enjoyed this video find
different things to decorate with maybe
get some different ideas let's just jump
on into the video just jump jump jump
and of use like doing
okay so this is what the room looks like
outside the door the best part about
this room in my opinion is the ceiling
because it is up what do you call this
like a vaulted ceiling is that what you
call it I might be wrong I like this
kind of ceiling because it makes the
room feel a lot bigger start from over
here and then all the way around I am
filming this at night I meant to do it
earlier but I didn't have time I also
love the big windows there's three big
windows right here together and I really
love it cuz it brings so much light into
the room unless it's nighttime I don't
ever need what you call it lights okay
so I get a lot of questions about that
painting right there I got it off of
hautelook so I get most of my paintings
from and then my bedding is from Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond some of the little pillows
back there are from Pier one
I have Olaf my bed frame is also you
can't really see it but I really do like
it it has like three little sections
where you could put your phone up here
at night which I really really love I
also got this headboard from HauteLook I
got these little guys from Big Lots I
got them like last year or so so I just
have two of them and I really like them
because this is where I like I store my
underwear and sports bras and things
like that have my charger and this is a
gift that I received from my friends
they know I love life-sized bears and
they got me this one for a birthday and
I was really excited about it then right
here I just have some Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
sprays that I really love I love the
eucalyptus cement scent really keeps me
calm at night and then I have the pillow
spray which I mean I don't think it
really works but you know it smells good
so this is a person that takes up my bed
all the time so I got both of my
curtains from Lowe's and it also got
these little mirrors that I have on the
sides from Lowe's as well I think they
were only about 90 a piece which I feel
like is not bad for these decorative
mirrors and then I got my little rods
right here from Bed Bath and Beyond they
were a little pricey but I really like
the way that they look so if you go to
the left from this you
then have my closet so this is an
overview the closet so I keep my shorts
in here my casual tops I have more stuff
back here and then I have my bags down
there like beach bags and things like
that I have a little step stool and then
over here I keep dresses rompers and
more dressier tops and then I have more
of those Big Lots things that have
workout clothes and this one and then
swim suits and cover-ups in this one so
this is a pretty nice size the closet
I'm really happy I have an additional
one in my bathroom because I wouldn't be
able to fit my jeans but I really really
like this and I like the setup of it too
so after you leave the closet I have my
TV right here that I got mounted and
then this dresser I also got from Ikea
this is where I keep bras bra let's sum
I think down here we have sleep clothes
and then here we have sweatshirts and
things like that in this this probably
doesn't look like a huge mirror but it
is ginormous and it is from Ikea and it
was only a hundred bucks which is
actually a really good deal for how
insanely large this mirror is and then I
needed something to fill up this wall so
I've had these frames from Marshalls for
forever I need to put actual pictures in
it but I haven't gotten around printed
in any off so I just kept what was
originally in it and then we have dog
bed right down there which is not very
attractive and then moving on to one of
my favorite parts of the house which
really just sold me is the bathroom so
it does have double sinks right here and
I have my lush back bones and I get a
lot of questions about this when I post
it on Twitter and stuff or if you see it
in videos I get all of my little glass
jars like that from Marshalls or TJ Maxx
it's kind of like one of those
hit-or-miss things and I just have like
my usual stuff over here and then I keep
like toothpaste things I use often in
these little drawers and this short is
full of like random stuff that's just
unorganized and the only organized part
of the sink is down here which is where
I keep
products and products that have been
sent to me that I just haven't been able
to use I usually give stuff like this
away pretty often and then if you turn
around this way we have this ginormous
tub
I never fill this tub up just because
it's huge and it's just it's too much
sometimes so but I really really love it
it's huge I wish it had like jets in it
and I really like this bathtub it's such
an upgrade from the apartment one
because the apartment one girl mm and
then there's just a little window right
here which I really like this brings in
a lot of light into the bathroom as well
and then we just have a standard walk-in
shower which is really nice I like the
fact that the shower and the bathtub
are both separate and then if you open
this door right here you have the
bathroom
oh that's all in there I actually had
that in my apartment and I put it in
here and I really loved it because that
way I can like hide tampons and stuff
and it's not like out for everybody to
see so yeah I really like this I think
this is so convenient too for when I
have guests over and if they're in my
room I could just close this instead of
closing the whole bathroom door right
and then once you walk out of there you
then have the other closet so this is
where I keep my towels robes and then
right like right now I just have some
vests in here but as it gets hotter I'm
going to like take all of this out and
put it in the other room where all my
other jackets are but I just keep these
here for now because with this Georgia
weather you have no idea what you're
gonna get then over here we have all of
my blue jeans up top and then below we
have all my black pants then more
patterned pants and skirts and then we
do have laundry yes I know I need to get
my life together with laundry I am
trying ever since I've moved I've been
completely completely thrown off because
I keep unpacking and finding more and
more clothes and I'm like oh my gosh
this is never-ending so I have extra bed
sheets here this could be organized
better but you know what we're gonna do
and there's more towels and then there's
hand towels down here so yeah I really
like this this is
this was a great addition and these
laundry bins I get a lot of questions
the ones that say laundry on them I got
it from like an outlet like a home decor
outlet so that's where I got those I
wish I would have gotten one more
because I really like them too I think
they're really really cute and I think
there were only about eight bucks
wherever I got them okay nice so that is
it for this video thank you so much for
