today we are doing a first impression on
something different that I've never seen
before so I'm so excited to try this out
I saw it on Sephora and I was just
really intrigued by it and I wanted to
try it out on camera for you guys so
this is the blend smart automated makeup
brush system and I got the starter set
whenever you order this make sure you
get this starter set and not just the
brush because the first time order the
brush head and then I was like oh what
the heck and I realized I had to buy the
starter set first so make sure you buy
this it is $69 and it has four and
almost a half stars on Sephora comp and
it has 26 reviews so this is what it
says it says natural-looking results
with confidence
flawless blending with less makeup is
the key to natural looking skin our
blend smart rotating brush it creates a
beautifully blended finish for your most
flawless application ever says it blends
evenly no lines or streaks better
coverage requires less makeup gentle
rotating motion ideal for even sensitive
skin Esmee ergonomic handle contoured
for comfort and control interchangeable
brush head change out the brush heads
not the handle now that's smart so it
says on the back so there's what I just
read right there this box is really nice
let's just open this up so just opens
well I am alright so it comes with a
battery the brush head and the handle so
I'm just going to put this all together
real quick touch this off then there
just on this
what do you think of that so I do
actually like the handle I feel like I'm
back in school again like riding on
something I think this is going to be
super comfortable it's not like very
heavy the weight from this handle
definitely comes from that bigger
battery another question is where would
you get the battery when it dies I don't
know if they have these kind of
batteries at Walmart because this is an
interesting looking battery I don't know
I don't know I would have to look on the
site and see because I don't know where
you get this kind of battery it's not
like a regular double-a or triple-a
battery this says to when you're
cleaning it and stuff the handle does
not need to get wet or damp under any
circumstances you just want to remove
the brush head from the handle by
pulling on the base just below the brush
hair do not pull on the brush hair do
not invent some water lay your brush
head on its side to dry never let the
brush head dry upright we're just gonna
go with these directions and see what
they say
so this says for liquid makeup use one
finger to apply 1 dot to each part of
your face and she has a dot on every
little point so we're just gonna follow
her lead we're gonna do what she's doing
I'm gonna be using the Clinique beyond
perfecting a foundation concealer I have
a full first impression video on that
and when the dot where she got her stuff
so 1 2 3 4 5 it's kind of one for best
results do not apply in circular motion
let the brush do the work for you turn
on the brush of the brush head starts to
rotate start blending your makeup by
holding the ergonomic handle and gliding
it slowly across your face side to side
and up and down Y applying light
pressure until your makeup is blended as
always so just go left right up down
touch up with a very small amount of
makeup and blend it and repeat as
necessary less makeup feels better on
your face and looks more natural okay
I'm so fascinated by this okay so we're
just gonna
I really just like moving my stinking I
see that okay here so we're just gonna
do half the face first it's so weird how
it's just like pulling the skin like
it's not hurting or anything but I'm
very lightly putting it to my skin as
well okay Cherokee's get in a way look
okay and people to here real test is the
nose you guys know Boop ask arrows I'll
get in my eyeball it's blending really
well though like this seems very uh
gimmicky but it's working I feel like if
you had a foundation that needed to be
blended in really quick this wouldn't
work whoa that's so weird
whoa whoa hey art I feel like you got to
be careful around your eyes because it
kind of does tug at the skin and
sometimes then just kind of like what
goes down so you have to be a little bit
careful and make sure you have a good
grip on it okay I don't think the
forehead is gonna be fully covered it
blended on the nose like super well the
bristles are really soft honestly let me
turn it off for a second
I personally thought that this was going
to not help with my rosacea like I
thought the redness was going to peak
through with the foundation because
sometimes when you keep blending with a
brush
I find that my foundation kind of
separates and my redness starts peeking
through
but that is not happening with this one
and I'm really surprised just really
blending it into the skin so I'm gonna
keep going I think I'm gonna have to add
just a little bit more to my forehead
and on the sides and I face over here I
love this foundation by the way if you
guys want to see that in-depth review I
will leave it down below
my heritage I would definitely recommend
like one of those bands that holds back
all your baby hairs that would probably
help that's kind of crazy to me that it
blended everything in and it looks
really good it doesn't look cakey or
anything like that it just is all
blended into my skin I feel like this
does take a little bit more time
obviously because you're just kind of
going back and forth I don't think it's
necessarily a time-saver because you
can't just go in circular motions since
it's doing that with the rotating head I
went no too close to your eye just
because it does kind of cool that the
eye a little bit so it's not harsh or
anything but it does kind of rotate and
sometimes it might fling up into your
eye and that would suck to get this
brush hit and your eyeball so I would
just keep it more like right here and
just really pay attention just so you
don't you know lose control of it but it
is really comfortable it's not super
heavy I think it looks really nice and
it can also just stand up by itself like
that which i think is really cool I
think it's really nice that they did
that because this is such a big brush if
you have a brush holder this is going to
take up a lot of room so the fact that
it could just stand like right next to
everything is awesome I think something
that would be really beneficial is if
they had a cap that you could put over
top of the little brush head just so if
you did stand it up no dust or debris
will get into it so that would be
awesome if it could just spit like right
over this little part I'm going to
finish dressed my makeup and then I'll
be back to end this video so my final
thoughts are I definitely think this
works I think it is such a cool product
I think we've all been just like waiting
for something like this to come out
something kind of like gimmicky at first
but then you try it out and it's like oh
hey it works I definitely think it's
sort the money and I definitely think
that it is practical now saying that you
don't have to go out and buy it there's
other brushes that would obviously you
know blend your foundation in really
nice but if you have like a really
difficult time finding brushes that
blend in your foundation really well and
don't separate your foundation I would
definitely try this one out I think it's
awesome
I think it is a little bit high
maintenance you know obviously you can't
get it wet or anything like that and you
have to change out the battery blah blah
blah but I think it's going to be a
while before that battery dies down and
it's so nice that this just like pops
off and you can just
clean it and I love the fact that this
is a duo fiber brush because it's dense
but it's not too dense it has a lot of
bristles and it really is forgiving but
I wouldn't think that eye duo fiber
brush would blend as well as this one
has but this one is just perfect and I
like that it's not a super long haired
brush the bristles are really nicely
packed and nothing has shed on me so I
really like it I think it's definitely
worth it I'm gonna keep it and keep
using it because I just think it's
interesting and I did buy that other
brush head but I'm probably going to
keep that just so in the next like 6
months I can pop this one off and put a
new one on let me know in the comments
if you've tried it what you thought when
you first saw this because I thought it
was a gimmick I will leave a link for
this down below where you could check it
out once a for calm and make sure again
you get the starter set I'll be sure to
leave the link for the starter set down

brush head thank you guys so much for
