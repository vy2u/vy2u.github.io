my running light routine this is the
most real running light routine that
I've ever done and it's really quick
really simple I just show you like my
go-to kind of outfit that I like to use
and of course this ponytail I didn't
even touch it because I'm kind of
feeling the messy ponytail vibe
especially with this outfit it's given
me spice girls 90s trend that's what's
good at me so I really like it I think
it's cute I think it's fun and it's
something really easy to do if you're
trying to run out the door but you need
to look somewhat presentable I think
this is perfect
and the makeup that I used is my go-to
actually have like a little section on
my desk now
but when I'm running a few minutes late
because it happens to the best of us and
I always like to be prepared so I have
it like standing on this brush stand
that I have and I'm actually using a new
face product in this that I've never
shown you guys but I love it because
it's amazing so if you are interested in
seeing how I get up get dressed and
frantically get my life together in like
probably 15 minutes then let's get
started
okay so after I get up all frantic and
crazy feeling I'm just gonna go ahead
and brush my teeth brushing your teeth
is the most important part of your day
so make sure you do it no matter if
you're running late or not I am gonna
skip a shower but I'm just gonna go
ahead and go into the Beauty room and
get started and just you know put a
light makeup on to get my face together
and like I said these are the products
that I know I like to use if I'm running
late because it's just really easy to
apply them and get them all taken care
of so I'm gonna go ahead and take a
makeup remover wipe and just take this
to my face and then we're gonna go ahead
in with this Smashbox camera ready BB
water I'm in the shade light/medium
right here and I'm not that self tan and
I love this so much now this is
different because it does have five and
one things that it does it Prime's it
perfects it protects it hydrates and
best part if you have oily skin it is
oil and alcohol-free and it does have
SPF 30 so it has that sun protection in
there again it has the primer and I like
to put this all over I even use it as a
concealer underneath my eyes because
honestly when you're running late you
don't have time to put all this
concealer on and it has a shared of
medium coverage and it is buildable so I
love this for days like today where it
still looks like my skin but it just
looks a little bit more perfect and if
you guys are interested you can win this
product by visiting a Smashbox BB water
calm I'll have a link down below in the
description box if you want to check it
out
and then I'm gonna take my ELF HD powder
and set it in place just to make sure it
lasts all day and then I'm gonna go in
with this elf bronzer and just bronze up
the skin just adds a tiny bit of color
and I'm good to go after that I'm going
to take this NYX gel crayon pencil and
we're gonna just line the upper lash
line with it and then apply mascara
using my favorite drugstore mascara
which is the voluminous miss manga from
L'Oreal after that we're gonna quickly
do some brows and I'm gonna take this
NYX brow gel
what's it called where is it say okay
mix mascara and I'm going to just kind
of fluff up the brows and add a little
bit of color to them it just makes a
really big difference in my opinion and
moving on to lips I'm gonna use a long
wearing lip product and this is from NYX
- it's the liquid smile in tea and
cookies I think I'll leave it down below
but I like it cuz it dries matte and
it's a really pretty pink so just kind
of brightens up the face and then that's
it for the face it's super super easy
I'm more of a base person so that's why
I love these Smashbox BB water and then
for an outfit I just do something really
casual I'm obsessed with boyfriend jeans
and like crop tops like this so it's not
too cropped it just shows a little bit
of your waist and then you have the
boyfriend jeans which I think are
durable and I love them and then
literally that is a you guys so I hope
you enjoyed this video I know it was
really quick but I figured I would show
you my favorite makeup and my favorite
outfit to wear when I am running late so
let me know in the comments what your
must-haves are when you're running late
and don't forget to subscribe and I will
see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
