another first impression Friday and it
is on something that you guys have asked
me to review for a really long time now
so I'm really excited that I found it in
stores I got to pick it up is the Real
Techniques miracle complexion sponge a
lot of people have been loving this I
have seen this in a few different
favorites videos so I kind of have high
hopes for it already I'm hoping it will
live up to all the hype that it's
getting right now you can get this at
Ulta I believe it was like six dollars
people are saying it's a really great do
before the Beauty Blender so I'm ready
to cut this thing open and see how it
works I did not find this for the
longest time because my Ulta didn't have
it but then all of a sudden my also got
like all these new Real Techniques
things like they have a bunch of
different brushes and just a lot of fun
stuff basically says great looks start
with a flawless base redefine your skin
with our miracle complexion sponge it's
a versatile design even evenly blends
makeup for a smooth enhance to finish
basically it's gonna do what the Beauty
Blender does just apply a foundation
beautifully and flawlessly so yeah I'm
gonna open it up and first off feel how
it is oh I want to tell you guys to I
actually picked up this Beauty Blender
from my Beauty Blender dupe from forever
21 let me know if you guys want to see a
video do you see the shape of this like
it looks like it's going to be nice and
I've been kind of trying to feel it
through here and so far it looks really
nice so if you guys want to review on
this let me know if you want like a
first impression I'll do either one for
you it doesn't matter to me whatever you
want to see so let's just open this up
and it's just like a little tiny sponge
one side is flat and then you have like
a rounder side I don't know if that
crease is supposed to be there mmm I
don't know
but it feels kind of hard right now so
I'm going to go put this underneath the
water and I will be right back okay so I
did put the sponge underneath the water
and it got a lot bigger it's super soft
and I'm excited to try this out now I'm
going to use the flat side for my
foundation and the pointy side for
underneath the eyes
so I'm going to take my foundation I
already have it out on my pallet and I
just dip the sponge in there get some
product on it I'm gonna start laying
this into the skin gotta move all this
hair what you thinking baby
what do you saw me doing okay honey you
got foundation on your nose oh my gosh
ah first off I like how this flat side
also gets underneath the eye really
really easily I feel like I feel like
it's covering more than the
Beautyblender covers this is doing a
great job so far like I'm really really
liking it all these people are coming
out with all these like Beauty Blender
dukes they're making it where you won't
even have to buy the Beauty Blender
anymore like spend $20 on the sponge
because I know that was the biggest
complaint whenever the Beauty Blender
was getting really hyped up was it was
so expensive and I mean it is it's
expensive for sponge I really like the
flat side I didn't think I was gonna let
like the flat side very much but I
really do like it
and it's easy if you've got your brows
done because you can just take that flat
side and go right around your brows
sorry that the lighting is off like it's
like a lot brighter over here and then
over here I'm sorry about that the Sun
is like a beaming in the room so it
makes like all of the color look off
okay first impression is I love it I
think it looks so good it feels really
awesome on the skin like I'm really
enjoying it and it makes the foundation
just look full as I just I love it I
love it I love it so far okay now we're
going to do concealer also if you guys
want to Touro on this eye look let me
know I just got the lorac Pro to go
palette in the mail because it's on sale
for $30 right now so go check that out
too if you're interested it was 40 I
think and I'm really liking the
eyeshadows and everything in the palette
taking the other side and blending this
out
you know really nice I love it it looks
so nice I don't know why my chests
always look so light on camera like look
at my arm compared to my face we're good
but like comparing to my chest it just
does not look right I know what the deal
is okay so I absolutely love this sponge
I'm going to go ahead and do the rest of
my face makeup and I will be back to
give you guys a full conclusion on this
little sponge okay so my final
conclusion is I absolutely love this you
could tell as I was you know applying it
that I really do love it honestly you
guys I think there's no sense in even
purchasing a Beauty Blender anymore if
like I have been an avid Beauty Blender
lover for a year or so even a bit longer
kind of for awhile and honestly I used
to love that thing and I would even try
dupes and be like this is ridiculous it
looks it does nothing but the last dupe
that I did I love that I will link that
down below if you want to check it out
this one has to take the cake mainly
because it's so accessible you can get
this at Ulta in stores online I love the
shape of it it's very different you have
the flat end and you also have the end
right here you can use either or side
for your foundation whatever you wanted
to do he has a really cool new unique
shape it feels just like the Beauty
Blender super super soft so definitely
go check this out you guys
save yourself fifteen twenty twenty-five
dollars and go get this for six bucks at
Ulta promise you you will not regret it
you guys know that I always give you
guys my honest reviews if something
sucks I'm gonna let you know I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I'm super happy
that this was a positive review you'll
definitely be seeing this more in videos
so thank you guys so much for watching
if you enjoyed it this first impression
then go ahead and give it a thumbs up
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
