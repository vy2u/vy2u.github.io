a another first impression videos that
we're starting on if I have Friday's
today which is first impression Fridays
if you don't know there will be a new
first impression video of every Friday
but the first one today we are going to
do the Revlon Colorstay smoky shadow
stick now I've seen these everywhere and
I've been so curious about them because
it says crease free smudge free all that
stuff and I got the one in atomic I
don't know why CVS puts these little
like addresses on it but this is the one
I got and basically it's just the end
with the gold and like the darker green
color so there wasn't a lot of
information on the package itself like
on this little guy and other than saying
it's smudge and crease free so I went to
the Revlon website and it says the
expertly coordinated shave slim
perfectly for smokey eye that last is
wears up for 12 hours and it does
increase fade or smudge all day so
that's basically all it says on the side
there's not too much information it's
just the little bullet points right
there so we will see I did get mine at
CBS for 879 so I actually like the
packaging I think it's really nice this
is what it looks like it's just really
nice and sleek and I just like it I
think it's really cute and a great
travellin this is definitely like ideal
for you I'm going to swatch these colors
real quick
pretty pretty pigmented I don't know if
you're able to see this but right here
this is one swatch to three or more and
I'll do the other side for you so maybe
you liked it when I do this with the
lipstick last time so I figured I'd do
it again
oh that was pigmented oh yeah the
greenside is pretty awesome so this is
right here one swatch two swatches three
swatches or more so I'm actually pretty
impressed by how pigmented it is I only
have face makeup on I did not put a
primer on my eyes or anything because if
this is crease and smudge free then I
shouldn't need a primer okay so now to a
close-up I'm going to put this gold
color all over my lid so I'm just going
put this on my lid
it's kind of like splotchy if you can
see so I'm going to try to Pat this in
really nice color though but it is kind
of splotchy
you
so first impression of the gold part
actually like the color I think it's
really pretty but like I said it's a
little splotchy but for the most part
it's okay for not having a primer now we
are going to go in with this green side
and I'm just going to concentrate this
more on the outer V and a little bit in
my crease so
so I'm just going to kind of outline
where I want it this green is so
pigmented I love it these colors are
gorge to gether
I'm just going to blend that out
by the way these do blend so easily like
ridiculously easily I like that about it
you
okay so for the rest my eyes all I did
was applied my Maybelline line stiletto
liner my L'Oreal hip liner on my
waterline and then the covergirl clump
crusher mascara and then I added my
favorite lip combo which if you don't
know what it is check out my November
favorites I am really really loving this
eye shadow I think it's so pretty I
really hope it stays all day cuz the
gold and green together they just look
so nice
not like too much you could always build
it up to be more um you know smoky and
dramatic but I'm kind of going out
during the day so I want to be looking
too crazy but again this is what the
packaging looks like love this and I do
still have to swatch it so on from what
I did earlier so I'm just going to rub
them and see if they budge so the Greens
kind of smudging a little bit and then
the gold is staying put all that no one
nowhere but the green kind of smudges as
you can see I have so much stuff to do
today we'll see how it lasts let's cross
our fingers it's good because I really
hope it does well because I really love
this product so far and it is now 1218
so I'm going to go do things and I'll be
back in a few hours let you guys know
what's going on hey guys so it is now
for 24 throughout this day I've been
pretty surprised on how well the
eyeshadow has stayed on usually I will
not go out the door without primer for
my eyeshadow because otherwise it will
crease like crazy if I don't have a
primer on so I was very nervous to go
out and try this baby out but I am super
impressed by it there is a little wear
on the lids which I'll show you here in
a minute but it's nothing crazy or
anything like that for it to last 12
hours I think it will last a very long
time I think a good eight hours it will
last but 12 hours I think you would see
some wear throughout the day because
that's a long time to have some makeup
on girl but I think for a good eight
hours this will stay on perfectly for
you I can only imagine how well this
will stay on if you had a primer on or
if you set it with some type of eye
shadow because this could be an awesome
base for eyeshadows because if it stays
on this well without a primer
I mean I can only imagine how great it
would be so I'm really quickly going to
show you my lid so this one is the one
where you could see the wear on the lid
like my skin sort of peeking through
this lid on the other hand still looks
okay it's not as bad as the other one I
also want to mention really quickly how
awesome this blends like with your
fingers with a brush it blends so well
so I definitely recommend it if you have
this product let me know what you think
of it in the comments below and if you
are excited about first impression
Friday's like I am then just like this
video letting me know and yes I hope you
guys enjoyed this and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
