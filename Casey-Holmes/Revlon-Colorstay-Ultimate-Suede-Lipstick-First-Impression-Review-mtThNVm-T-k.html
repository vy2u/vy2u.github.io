doing a first impressions video on this
Revlon Colorstay ultimate suede lipstick
I just have one the one that I have a
zero eight five what is it trend setter
but there are twenty colors at my CV is
they had a big old stand all the names
on it and stuff and if you don't know
this is what it looks like very kind of
sleek packaging but it really reminds me
of the wet and wild kind of packaging
this was ten dollars which I feel like
is ridiculous for a drugstore lipstick
because I mean I could go spend an extra
five dollars and get a Mac one that's
like better quality you know what I mean
so ten dollars it's kind of like really
so I haven't even opened this yet but
I'm going to go ahead and open it oh so
it kind of clicks up and clicks down but
this is the color it's really pretty
kind of matches my nails without the
glitter and I'll swatch it for you
this first swatch is why I just do one
swipe the second one right here is to
the last one or you pretty much get the
most color is three swipes or more I'm
going to apply this to my lips I don't
know if I choose a lip liner or not
those thickens this is the first
impression video I should in nah I'm
gonna use one
looks pretty on
you
so to me putting it on it was really
smooth it still has a smooth the texture
to it
and it has that glossy kind of finish I
think I probably would rather use a lip
liner with this too but without it it's
fine it's nothing crazy um but it's a
different texture for a lipstick like it
definitely felt like I have a gloss on
but I don't but it's I mean to me it
looks it looks fine it's pretty
pigmented and I think it looks good
anyone not I feel very patriotic red
lips blue balls I'm just gonna let it
sit for a few hours um I don't really
have anything bad to say about it right
now because applying it it looks fine
and it's creamy it just feels like a
nice lipstick I don't really get the
suede part of it but to me it's just
like a lipstick with a gloss over let me
show you you can see how it just has
that shine to it
so to me it doesn't look bad I mean I
don't have a problem with it it has it
it does have a different texture
definitely but it's nothing that like is
grossing me out or anything like that I
don't know how this is lasting power I
never it doesn't say amaze Colorstay so
it should be good because colors say
products you know were supposed to stay
on so since it's a colors day we'll see
it's 1259 and I'm going to go do some
things edit some videos probably eat
drink
hi guys okay so it's now 3:40 so right
when I put it on and like turn off the
camera or whatever I went downstairs it
was making me somebody in it literally
like dry mat and it was sticky it was
the weirdest feeling I don't know why
but like it's completely matte now and
it's not shiny at all and it stained my
hands like right after I turn off the
camera
wiped it off and it stained my hands
I'll show you though
no transfer a little bit gun on my coat
cam but not a lot at all if you want to
see I'll show you it's probably
disgusting to show you this bunker but
see how there's not a lot of transfer on
there and that was right after I filmed
the video so but I want to say I don't
think I go and purchase this again feel
like I could get the same thing with
this wet and wild lipstick and red
velvet because they're pretty much the
same thing um and this is 299 and this
is $10 I don't know if they're really
worth it because the feeling that I got
with that felt like a really sticky lip
gloss to me and like even now my lips
stick together I think that's just the
colors a formula of this to really make
sure it lasts a long time it's going to
be a little bit sticky just like with
the Mac what does it look glasses those
are so sticky and I actually hate those
um but they're so sticky but they last a
long time so maybe that's the trick to
this I don't know
mine's less of a long time the color
hasn't faded the only thing that has
changed is that it went matte and then
had like a sticky feeling to it which I
guess that's the whole part of keeping
it on
you
it wipes off certain parts it doesn't
wipe off the whole thing and it's hard
enough it's a really weird lipstick and
it did stay my lips but it's definitely
one of those lipsticks you have to try
for yourself at first its glossy then it
gets mad then it gets sticky so it's all
about trying if you think you're going
to like that um then I would try it out
it definitely makes it last a while
I'm through eating and drinking and I
guess kissing it lasts a pretty long
time so it's definitely one of those you
just have to try out and see if you like
it so if you have tried it let me know
down below what you think about it and
if you want more first impressions
videos then just like this video and I
will see you guys in my next one
mmm ahh bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
