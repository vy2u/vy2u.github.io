another first impression video for first
impressions Friday I haven't made a
video in like a week I have been so busy
with the holidays and everything going
on I was supposed to have a video up
Monday but it just didn't work out and
then I've got a new laptop I got a
MacBook Pro if you don't follow me on
Twitter and Facebook you wouldn't know
but I did get a new laptop so I'm still
experimenting with how to use it because
I've never had a MacBook I've always
been a Windows person anyway so what the
video is gonna be on is this Revlon
Photoready BB cream it's a skin
Perfector with SPF 30 I got mine in
light media so I did take pictures of
the display and it says the new Revlon
Photoready baby cream skin perfection
without the layers hydrates like a
moisturizer smooths like a primer covers
like a foundation blurs flaws like a
concealer and protects with SPF 30
sunscreen they only have three colors
you have light light medium and medium
probably medium when I'm tan tan but I'm
not sure I've never tried to be cream
this the first time I've tried one and
if you're wondering at CVS it was 10 79
and this is also one fluid ounce and
that's what the packaging looks like
just nice little sleek packaging so I'm
just going to apply this amount with my
fingers see how this works out
now I know BB creams are not sustainable
coverage huh I dunno so that's what the
first application looks like it actually
kind of looked again we get too close
from here
it didn't even out my skin tone it looks
like it looks really good I probably
should have got a medium because you can
see it kind of doesn't match my neck
that's actually really nice coverage
when I was putting on on the I was
looking in the viewfinder didn't look
like a lot I'm gonna apply one more time
just a little bit more to see if it
covers any better by building it up
so again just sometimes it's hard
fitting stuff all up the offender it
looks so different and when you found
her in the mirror but also before I even
applied this I didn't apply my
moisturizer from it's gotta fill now I
don't know if you're supposed to apply
BB creams and like to applications but I
just did so we'll see how that works out
fine
my oily skin also if you did not have
very oily skin that's another kind of
reason why I'm sort of stayed away from
BB Creams but it is the winter time so
it should be good and see yeah it looks
really good I mean if you're just going
for like a really light coverage for the
day I think this would be really nice
it's kind of shiny I'm gonna set it with
a powder you guys know that even when I
dig foundation first impressions I will
set with a powder because that's just
what I do I would never not said
foundation BB creams I can say are also
a foundation but honestly it looks good
like I didn't expect it to look that
good it really did just kind of even out
my skin tone and make it look a lot
better so I like it so far and I'm just
going to set it with my Physicians
Formula covert ops 2 and powder matte it
up a little bit so I like this though
like if you just want to even out your
skin tone or not apply a bunch of stuff
then this is the way to go this is what
it looks like so far it's pretty early
in the morning in a 704 and I'm just
going to wear this throughout the day I
do work today so I'm sadly not gonna be
able to do like an in-between update I
work a complete nine-hour day today but
I will be taking notes and writing down
the time and when I think of it
throughout the day so I will be able to
tell you that at the end of the video
when I kind of do my conclusion and what
I think about it and stuff but first
impression I'm really really liking it
you can kind of see it just even it out
I do have redness but it's not that bad
alright it feels really really good on
the skin I'm gonna go ahead and finish
my face and get ready for work and I
will see you guys in a few hours
hey guys so I'm back and it is now 549
I'm really liking it so far like I told
you guys earlier I wasn't able to bring
a camera but I did take some notes down
on my iPhone so I will go ahead and read
those off to you nail at 10:30 I said my
skin looked fine it was a little shiny
in my t-zone so I bought in my face with
a tissue and I did not reapply powder
and it was still the same coverage as
when I
applied it and it didn't look cakey it
has that looked cakey at all throughout
this day like it just looks like your
skin but better like just even and it
just looks amazing Matt 12:40 I said my
face looked a little too shiny again so
I did let my face and I did apply powder
the powder that I applied is the
Maybelline Dream matte powder if you
have that pattern you know that it is
just not full coverage it basically is
something to keep you matte that's
pretty much all it's for it applies no
coverage for me at all and then I also
at 3 o'clock I'm said I'm still matte
and it looks good not oxidizing or
anything like that and I still hadn't
touched up with powder and I'm still
running on that face now and like I said
I really really liked it and I'm not
that shiny at all as you can tell on my
nose it has kind of wore off but that's
just because it's so big and always in
the way and I'm always touching it and
all this other kind of stuff so whatever
but usually honestly whenever I put face
products on the first place it will
start to where is my nose just because I
touch it all the time but I love this
product I actually loved it so much that
I went out today and bought the darker
shade the medium shade so light medium
medium I bought both of them just
because you know sometimes I just don't
want to wear a foundation I just want to
apply something on my face and be done
and I think this is a great product for
that only thing I have to say about the
product that sucks is the color
selection s only con I feel like
otherwise I love this product it has not
looked cakey at all today
it just looks gorgeous looks like your
skin just even and better if you have
this pipe let me know what you think of
it in the comments below as always and
please like this video if you liked it

weekend only think of them or I'll film
