a first impressions video on this Rimmel
clean finished matte foundation it
claims to make you look 100% poreless
and it controls your oil it's
lightweight a clean matte finish up to
12 hours my sister Murtala just tested
hypoallergenic no acne genic fragrance
free so this is what it looks like I
found it at Walmart for about three
dollars and some change that's basically
why I wanted to try it because it's said
matte on it and it was super super cheap
so I figured you guys would like that so
um I don't know if this is exactly my
color it's in classic beige number 250
but you open it up it's a really thick
foundation you can tell and it has like
a little spatula on it so you can easily
get the product only things that I have
on my face or my oil control moisturizer
by Cetaphil which I really really love I
mean using this for a few months now and
it's one of my favorite moisturizers has
I've ever used and then this high drops
of tone instant effect 90 second Rico
reducer which I'm obsessed with I love
this stuff so I'm gonna go ahead and
just try this baby on and I'm going to
just scoop some out and put my top up
just in K now my hair's gonna my nervous
today so you have to excuse it now I
hope if anything I hope is it's too
light for me alright and I'm gonna apply
mine with a real techniques brush I'm
gonna just apply with this little one
it's the expert face brush so I just
scooped some out on my hand and I'm just
going to apply this all over
so this is what looks like I really like
it so far it's not really covering up
that much redness on my cheeks I kind of
had to build it up a little bit to even
cover that but it covered up for the
most part for a four dollar foundation I
mean it's not bad at all um the finish
is nice and I'm just going to put the
rest of my makeup on like under-eye
concealer and I'm not gonna put any
dermablend concealer on my cheeks cuz I
want to see how my cheeks last the feel
of it I could definitely feel on my skin
and it's kind of sticky but I'll just
let it dry for a little bit and see how
it works and I'll come back on after I
finished the rest of my makeup so I'll
be right back so finishing up my makeup
all I did was applied the Maybelline
instant age rewind underneath my eyes
because I really like this stuff and I
finally got it in a lighter color so I
decided to use that today and then just
to set everything I used my makeup
forever super matte loose powder and I
had to set it because I have such oily
skin I just can't go without powder I'm
sorry I so far I'm really liking it I
think it looks really nice um I don't
think it's completely poreless but I
think it gives you a nice flawless
finish so far I do like the coverage of
it now I didn't apply anything to my
cheek so I usually let a little bit peek
through anyways but so far this is okay
in my book I have some things I have to
do today go out and do some stuff and
we'll see how it lasts throughout the
errands and stuff that I have to do
today but like I said I will be back in
a few hours and it is let me see I'll
just tell you guys your time the time is
131 so I'll be back in a few hours to
let you guys know bye hey guys so I just
got back from shopping and it is now 851
at night so if had this foundation on
for a few hours and it kind of did get
blotchy like you can see where my
redness started peeking through really
bad and the color just started fading
away so it did kind of get blocked she
bent honestly I didn't see anything you
know wearing off until probably about an
hour
go so I didn't put powder on my face
throughout the day and I did put
concealer on my cheeks I feel like if I
would have done those two things
probably woulda lasts a little bit
longer but I don't agree with 100%
poreless thing I do have pretty large
pores and it doesn't really like
minimize them or anything like that I
definitely agree with it keeping you mat
for a long period of time not 12 hours
but it does keep you mat for quite a few
hours especially I bet if you just blot
your face with powder and stuff it'll
really last
it is lightweight I do agree with that
when I first put it on I know I was like
oh I don't know if I like it but I do
like I didn't really feel it on my skin
and all I felt super lightweight and it
was like oh no it was just really really
nice and I'll step transferwise I was
trying on clothes and every time I put
them over my head I didn't see any
transfer on those clothes or my clothes
at all so that's definitely an A+ I
really like this foundation I'm going to
continue to use it because I really like
it it doesn't beat my makeup forever
though it doesn't beat it this is a
great alternative if you don't want to
buy the Revlon Colorstay or if you just
don't want to buy a high-end foundation
this one's great if you have oily skin
as well I definitely definitely
recommend it it's three dollars in like
40 something cents so you can't go wrong
with it I mean it's so so so cheap the
Revlon Colorstay definitely has more
lasting power and definitely is more
full coverage for this one you sort of
have to build up the coverage or add a
concealer on top so but I mean what can
you expect this is three bucks I mean
it's amazing I really like it so like if
I'm gonna continue to use it I'll let
you guys know more in the future what I
think about this product so if you have
this foundation or you've tried it as
well then leave a comment down below let
me know what you thought of it because
I'm sure a lot of other people would
love to hear everybody else's opinions
on it and stuff so I give this an A+
though I think it's really good for such
a cheap foundation check it out if you
are interested and also I had a
subscriber thank you by the way to
whoever you are I know I commented back
to you but they mentioned that I should
do FIF which is the first impression
Fridays which I thought was such a cool
idea and like would be such a fun series
on my channel so if you're interested in
seeing that the
just like this video I thought it was
super cute and also leave a comment down
below on some things that you would like
to see a first impression on so you can
do high end drop store jokes or probably
be the easiest for me to do like every
Friday maybe every once in a while I'll
do a high-end purchase but definitely
let me know what you would like to see
down below don't forget I will put my
blog channel down below and actually
filmed a vlog today whoa it's nothing
too crazy but you know it's my first one
so thank you guys so much for watching
and I will see you next time
mwah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
