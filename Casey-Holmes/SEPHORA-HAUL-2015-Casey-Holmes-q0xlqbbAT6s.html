Sephora haul for you I have not shopped
at Sephora in a hot minute and I wanted
to stock up on some things and try some
things out so I figured I would splurge
and just try some new things out like I
said I have not gone to support and
forever so I'm really excited and really
pumped to show you guys these products I
have so many new products coming for you
guys I just filmed a makeup tutorial on
this look using some new products and
hopefully you guys love it and you'll
see it soon so I'm sorry I'm in the same
outfit you'll be seeing the makeup
tutorial next but I didn't want to
change from this top I love this top
it's from topshop by the way if you're
wondering this box is kind of heavy so
we're just gonna we're just gonna wing
it first things are really boring but
every time I make an order at before I
always get some more Beauty blenders so
I just picked up two more of these
I love Beauty Blender so much I've been
using them a ton lady a ton lately with
my Too Faced Born This Way absolute
perfection foundation which is what I'm
wearing right now I just love the combo
of this and the Beauty Blender it just
gives a really flawless finish and then
a repurchase that I haven't been able to
tell you guys about because I forgot
when I threw it away this is an all time
favorite shampoo of mine right now is
the BB hairdresser's invisible oil
sulfate free shampoo I love this the
moment that I went darker like the last
time I got my hair done she used this on
me and I'm telling you it was like a
life-changing for my hair my hair felt
so smooth I could brush through it
easily like we didn't even need
conditioner so I love this I highly
highly highly recommend it it has six
feather light oils to soften thicken
detain or no tame do you for his
detangle and protect and I'm like
honestly I don't recommend a lot of
high-end shampoos this one is totally
worth the money so that's what it looks
like you can get at salons you could get
it at Sephora but you can't get at Ulta
because I tried to go get it from them
and they didn't have bumble so only
those places oh I got some samples too
because I'm traveling a lot these next
couple weeks so I got like a mini Dolce
Dolce
this one right here so they had a mini
one for a point perk and I took
advantage of that they also had this
origins ginseng refreshing eye cream if
I'm not mistaken thank you but if I'm
not mistaken I've heard a lot of great
things about this but I don't know let
me know if you have tried this never
tried it before but I'm all about a
travel size eye cream so I want to try
it out and I'm not really familiar with
origins so yeah let me know in the
comments what you think about that brand
and I love this brand I've tried them a
bunch of times but I've never tried
these products this is the Murad
perfectly ages ageless can I not talk
today the mere act perfectly ageless
skin renewing set and it has just a few
things in it and I'm this was a like 500
point perk I think it's very rare that I
splurge on my points but I figured why
not okay next up this is very
interesting to me and I can't wait to
try it out and let you guys know what I
think as most of you know I have very
very very disgustingly oily skin like
the kind of oils that you're just like I
could wipe it off and give it to
somebody with dry skin and they would
probably have normal skin that was a
little gross but I mean let's be real so
this is the mulatto Rossi by Beauty
Blender and it says a better way to blot
to washable oil blotting sponges and
this just seemed really interesting to
me I've never heard of such a thing I
know there's like blotting papers but
I've never heard of a blotting sponge so
leave it up to Beauty Blender to test it
out so it comes with a liquid Beauty
blender cleanser I haven't used the
other like the liquid of beauty blender
cleanser but I personally feel like the
solid is much better and gets everything
a lot cleaner so that's just my opinion
but it comes with this little case and
you open it up and it has a mirror that
you can peel this off which I'm not
gonna do yet and then like I said it has
two of the little sponges in here and
they're really thin I don't want to use
it now because I want to wash it before
I use it so you can wash it and then let
it dry in the musings as a blotting
sponge so I'm going to be using this
when I'm traveling I'm gonna go ahead
and watch this before I leave and I will
be using them and letting you guys know
what I think okay so I got two things
from Laura Mercier the first one is a
face illuminator I was so excited about
this because I saw it online and I was
like that is so freaking beautiful it
looks it looks magical it really does
this is in the shade and discretion and
OH
first I love Laura Mercier's packaging I
know it's like bulky but I just love it
so this is what it looks like doesn't it
look magical I mean seriously
doesn't it look amazing that's it's
watched oh my gosh it is beautiful it's
living the perfect summer highlight I
know we're still kind of in summer I
think it's gonna be beautiful as long as
I say self-tan it's so pretty I cannot
wait to try then the last thing I got
from Laura Mercier is this baked blush
bronze in ritual and I just want to try
this out I don't necessarily know
everybody's as blush and when he says
bronzer um it's just one of those things
that I don't know how I'm gonna use it
yet because it's a lot darker than what
I expected
so same packaging but this is what that
looks like I might use it as a blush
more than anything I I think it's very
very beautiful though at the it's just
starting it might just be more of an
orange II blush or I might be able to
use it as a bronzer it's kind of one of
those things that I'm going to have to
try out okay so I finally finally
finally got the Tarte tartlet palette
I've heard so many great things about
this palette and I've always just been
kind of like do I really need another
palette well the answer is no but I just
couldn't help myself
so it comes with this little daytime
playtime sheets things and then this is
what the pad looks like is such a
beautiful palette and then you open it
up oh there's the thing and these are
the shades I just think it's so
beautiful I'm not normally a purple
person but these Purple's aren't like
in-your-face purple they're very muted
and very great for even just everyday
looks so yeah I think this palette is
really gonna make a brown eyes pop and I
want to play with it so if you want to
see a video with this palette let me
know in the comments and I will do that
for you so I got two different
foundations the first one is this
shochet oh I don't know if I said that
right I'm sorry if I didn't the makeup
dual balancing foundation
color selection is the worst I hate it
the color selection of this and the next
foundation I'm going to show you guys
they don't have a lot of colors and
they're a little bit difficult to to
figure out but this had a lot of great
reviews for people with oily skin and I
just wanted to test it out like I said I
don't know about this color the color
selection just wasn't there though so
that's what it looks like is it just a
poor out foundation for how much I spit
on this it is lord have mercy I feel
like if you're high-end you should have
a pump for how much you spend on some of
this stuff but it's in the shade natural
deep ochre 0-60 and it says it's a
minimum coverage semi matte and it's for
a normal to combination skin Oh
a long-lasting look of a foundation that
responds to skin specific needs
increases moisture and dry areas
minimizes trying for a soft matte look
and promotes optimal medium balance I
don't know it sounds good who knows
we'll be going into fall and winter here
soon so I'll have to try something that
you guys know what you think this
foundation I've actually wanted to try
for months and months now I just
couldn't decide on a color and I figured
why not try this color who knows if
it'll be the right match this is a
g-body it clocked matches to me oh I
don't know it's a fluid foundation with
SPF 20 in it and yeah it just seemed
interesting to me and I just wanted to
try it out so some of the colors it just
kind of depends on your skin tone and
how it reacts to your skin because
sometimes it could be a little red
sometimes it can be a little like orange
it really just depends the packaging is
really cute on this you just open this
up and then pump out I think this is the
kind of packaging that you need if
you're gonna spend money on a foundation
okay moving on to some other stuff I dig
it two more of these Kat Von D's liquid
lipsticks I have bone it bow and arrow
on right now with my urban decay 1993
lip liner I just love Kat Von D's liquid
lipsticks I have a ton over here that
are purchased I really love them they're
amazing and the first one I got is
double dare this is more of like a rosy
dark new no a great everyday a matte lip
color so again it's kind of like more of
a rose
nude shade and oh so pretty so that's it
right there and again like I said it
drives Matt you just give it a few
minutes and it'll be as Matt as my lips
right now but I love this color she did
come out with a bunch of different
colors I showed some in my last
favorites video if you haven't checked
it out on like it down below and this
one isn't damned I don't know if this
one's new but this is gorgeous for the
fall and winter time because it's so
dark it's like a black cherry color it's
very very deep and dark but oh my gosh
look at how pretty that is it looks
black but I love it
I'm all about some dark lip color so you
can see right there it does have a like
cherry tint to it it's just very very
very dark but hey I mean come on now
everybody loves a dark lip I feel like
as the years go on people are more and
more accepting of dark lipstick anybody
know just me I feel like they are okay
and then I also oh I also got this
sample of the Elizabeth and James
Nirvana for her the black one I haven't
tried this yet hopefully it's good
because I've heard a lot of things about
that as well but then I got this Estee
Lauder blush this isn't the color since
HR since Jewish this isn't the color
sensuous sensual or child this is in the
color sensuous rose it's a Staten blush
I like this packaging I like a sailor's
packaging I don't know about you I love
it comes with a little brush that will
be tossed out but this is the shade
right here isn't that beautiful just a
beautiful everyday color oh it's a
little lighter than I expected Oh
hopefully it shows up on my cheeks
that's a lot lighter than I expected
oh I don't know it might be actually no
it could probably work let me stop
talking crap and let me wear it on my
face for a couple times and let you know
but I mean it's a really pretty everyday
color oh I also got this this is really
random and different but it intrigued me
it's called it's called the Sephora brow
thicker supposedly you're supposed to
make your brows look thicker and who
doesn't want that so I got this for oh
it's like a powder and just
interesting I'm gonna have to go look up
like little reviews on this because I
think they were good I'm pretty sure I
looked up reviews and they were good
usually I don't buy something they have
bad reviews but we'll see I don't know I
figured this would be great for days and
I don't once fill in my brows or if I
fill in my brows and there's a little
area that needs to be a little more
intense I would use this so yeah I'll
let you guys know it's a powder though I
didn't expect it to be a powder expected
between a Jill this is Yvonne she a
healthy glow powder long-lasting
radiance totally weightless in the shade
three amber crisps or I don't know here
you go just will just show you because
we all know I can't say the names of
anything Gigi my sheet or NARS and it's
just a little package like this and you
open it up and you have this beautiful
like bronze e glowy bronzer
I love Giovanni's bronzers they are more
of a terracotta feel as you can see they
look more orange but I personally like
that sometimes so that's it right there
it does give you a really healthy glow
you can kind of see it shine at the
light I don't know if you can see it but
it has like a little sheen to it it's
very beautiful and I can't wait to wear
it so this is something I haven't gotten
ever because I have always been like why
would anybody want that it's the urban
decay and make it illuminated powder in
the shade luminous I will not use this
on my face because it is pretty much
glitter that's what this is and the
packaging is just humongous on this but
it's really pretty it's just huge so you
open it up oh it has a brush that's why
it's so huge right there open it up and
this is what it looks like you can see
how much glitter isn't that like it is
so intense the only reason why I got
this is to use it for my body all right
that's the only reason why I got it
because look at how glittery it is
unless you're super into a glittery
chunky highlight you could use this on
your face but I'm not into a really
chunky highlight I think it's just too
much okay I have two more products to
show you guys and this one is new this
is the Becca shadow and light to brow
contour mousse in cocoa cocoa was a
lighter shade I couldn't
sigh between this one's in the darkest
shade because the darkest shade looked
pretty freakin dark and now that I have
this one I'm like dang I probably should
have gone with the darker shade this is
a packaging
kind of looks like I'm Stas Diaz dipbrow
you can see right here you have the brow
shade and then you have the highlight
umm I don't know if I'm gonna like this
color on my brows I think I might I
think if I just build it up well no no
it's looking like a little gray toned
umm I'm not yeah I'm gonna have to
exchange that for the darker shade but
they are very mu C very creamy and
that's the highlight shade so if you are
more of a blonde or if you have really
light brown hair I would totally
recommend this color but if you have a
darker hair like me I would definitely
recommend the color up from this cuz she
does only have two shades and don't be
intimidated by it online because I know
I was but this one looked a lot darker
online to me so and then the last thing
I got I am probably most excited about
this it is the Anasazi of Beverly Hills
the shadow contour world traveler eyes
shadow palette I really like Anasazi as
eyeshadow palettes I purchased a couple
from her in the past it's been a while
since I purchased another one because I
feel like there's just always new
palettes coming out and I just can't
keep up so this is what it looks like I
actually like this packaging I like that
it's matte and it doesn't look like it's
gonna get super dirty but what really
matters is what's on the inside and I
love these colors I love them I think
this is gonna be so pretty for fall I
love this kind of like green gold right
here of course you know this is like my
favorite shade and I love that it has a
black and it has pretty much everything
you'll need and I'm really excited to
play with this so again if you want a
