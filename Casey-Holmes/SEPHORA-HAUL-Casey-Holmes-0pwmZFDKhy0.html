one of my favorite videos to prepare for
and to film for you guys and that is a
Sephora haul but I'm sure you knew that
by the title I'm really excited to share
these goodies with you guys I've had
these actually sitting up on my jewelry
chest for a really long time
like a couple weeks now and I'm finally
just getting around to doing this so I
have actually a lot of repurchases in
here and I also have scented products as
well I didn't go too crazy because some
of the new products I wanted to try I
was in hearing like that green of her
views like that really can't bless so if
you tried the new like Urban Decay
blushes let me know II think of them
down below okay so the first thing and
that I purchased that was repurchase is
this bumble and bumble bee bee
thickening a dry sponge spray I love
this because it's a great kind of
texturising volumizing mist and all you
do is you just shake it up a little bit
and yes spray it all over here which I
haven't got anything in my hair this is
just blow dried hair you know I don't
like doing it but this goes so good it
has so much texture to your hair and a
lot of volume so after I'm done curling
my hair I usually like to top it off
with this and for me I feel like it does
keep the curls locked in for a really
long time and yeah I just really really
love it so baby thickening a dry fun dry
and she was right this stuff right here
it's good but this next repurchase is
actually something that I can't live
without
I tried weaning myself outfit and I went
right back to it because I just think
it's amazing it's the Clarins one-step
gentle exfoliating cleanser you've
probably heard me talk about this before
but oh hello white boxes just never show
up for camera very well so this is an
exfoliator with an orange extract this
is for all skin types I have very very
oily skin and I really love this I've
actually been using this so some of its
gone as you can see but this stuff is so
amazing I had to go like a week and a
half without an exfoliator because I
have very sensitive skin I can't use the
ones from the drugstore because every
single one that I've tried has broke me
out currently breaking out because I
decided try
I'll turn on my face which was not a
smart idea my skin's mad at me so
anyways I can't really try like
drugstore ones just because my skin is
so used to high-end skincare and their
ingredients I just I used the same
products all the time right now and I've
been using them for the past like six
months or so I love this it's good stuff
I literally felt such a difference
because I could feel like the dead skin
on my face within that week and I was
like oh my gosh this is so gross but the
moment I went in with this I'm telling
you you could just feel all that dead
skin or just come right off her face and
your face is so smooth I love it okay so
this is something that I was wearing and
now I can't find it because it's like a
my purse somewhere I checked my purse
but it's not my purse but the last place
I were putting it was in my purse so I
have no idea where it is
but I do love this and the color it's
the Too Faced melted Chihuahua liquefied
at long red lipstick I love these liquid
lipsticks I have quite a few of them
they're my favorite and then love this
color it's just that pinky mauve nude
and it's beautiful so hopefully I can
find it because I'm not purchasing
another one okay oh this is something I
found at the little checkout line and
I'm obsessed with this because I love
her big translucent powders Laura
Mercier deluxe mini translucent loose
setting powder in a mini puff literally
the cutest thing ever and I love
translucent powders even on the go as
long as they have a pup I still have
mine Giovanni one that I'm so obsessed
with like it's it's beautiful it keeps
you so mad it's just the best powder
ever I'm thinking of buying another one
because right now mine's in my Jeep and
it doesn't come out of my car like it
stays in my Jeep or in my purse and I
needed buy another one to keep up here
to like set my makeup I don't think I
really need to buy another one I don't
want to spend the money on it but I need
another one to like keep up here because
that powder is so good but anyways so
this is just the mini version of her
loose transparent powder and I believe
this puff all this pop doesn't fit in
knocks that sucks
I wish the puff would fit in there but
it doesn't look like it's gonna fit in
there you guys you must you want a
little tough but it fits in the
container so it doesn't get like overly
dirty with things in the world I mean it
barely fits in there so I'm just going
to use a brush for this but yeah this is
what it looks like it looks exactly like
the mama one but just ten times smaller
this is another repurchase for my super
dry skin if you watched me for a while
I've mentioned this so many times it's
the lock seat on ultra rich body cream
rich in shea butter and this stuff is so
good I'm telling you it's just like the
best thing ever invented the best body
butter oh I always do that I always sit
there and like poke this and I'm and I
literally look to a sign I see this
little flap and I'm like oh it just
smells clean so it doesn't interfere
with your perfume or anything if you
want to wear perfume with this it
doesn't interfere with any of that and a
little bit goes a long way and it is
such a thick cream like it's so so thick
you see that like nothing nothing coming
out it's a really thick body cream but
I'm telling you if you have super dry
skin like the only areas I have dry skin
is on my body that's because I really
suck at lotioning my skin after
showering I'm sorry what I do I suck I
sometimes I'm just like a Russian don't
feel like doing it but when I need to go
in and moisturize I will use this and it
like transforms my skin my skin will be
so dry and dehydrated and then I'll put
this on and it's like a whole nother
ballgame like it just makes my skin glow
I love it
the next thing I repurchase is this
Tarte tie performance maracuja neck
cream and I really love this for my neck
Mill as you get older you can really
tell your aging about your neck and your
chest if you don't
good care of it even just naturally
you're gonna age on your decollete and
everything so it's good just to go ahead
and take care of it and moisturize and
kind of prevent it even though a second
boy stur eyes and weave argues that
what's this though this is what it looks
like it's just a little jar like this
it's really cute this again is a really
thick and heavy cream and for me I feel
like it really kind of blurs out the
lines and blurs any imperfections I have
on my neck in my chest I forget where I
was at because on camera just cut me off
because it's rude so anyways I really
really do love us though it's a nice
thick moisturizing cream that I think
will be great in the long run and yeah
I've purchased a second one so I'm this
like it must be real good I saw this and
I was like I missed you I got a heavy
back in my life and as these smashbox
pore minimizing primer i just used to
love this stuff me arriving it first
came out i used the whole entire tube up
so i wanted to get back into it because
i missed it at that large pores and I
hate that I hate having pores because
pores are just annoying and I mean if
you even use the wrong foundation your
pores will just look so bad like even
worse if you have large pores you know
I'm saying I feel like I could really
tell the difference between using this
and not using it and I think that this
along with my favorite primer water buy
them of the moment I think this too will
be like a really good combo so I'm
excited about that and then the last
repurchase is actually this NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the shade medium one
custard I always use this for right on
the bridge of my nose if you watch my
videos I love it for my nose I feel like
it lasts a really long time I don't like
it underneath my eyes though just for
some reason I just I I can't like it I
feel like it looks a little thick kind
of where it is but I just love it for I
knows I've been using it constantly and
wait are these different on others same
size that was like wait this looks
smaller for some reason but you can see
and that this is my old tube and I'm
like scraping the sides of it I swatch
these in store and I was obsessed with
them and let me first tell you I love
the like radiant packaging of this like
Hello that is the color combo they
decided to go
is beautiful so this is the color liar
and I got two nudes obviously because I
wanted to try them out before I
purchased any other ones but I love the
packaging of these new Urban Decay
lipsticks or lip glosses I'm sorry I was
really hesitant when I was walking up to
these because i swatched the naked skin
lip glosses and I was like no those are
so sheer why didn't even have multiple
colors of that because you can't even
see it on the lips I was pleasantly
surprised by these so yeah again this
one is liar let's just do one stroke
okay maybe two
so that's liar isn't it so pretty it's
just a darker Mavi pink nude it's just
it's so beautiful I love this so much
and it's so pigmented and the other one
I got which is one of my favorites as
well it's called kinky kinky it's
definitely a lighter version of this and
a little bit more pink but it's very
pretty actually might put it on right
now because I put on creme de nude and
then a darker gloss over it but I just
cannot stand crimson nude anymore y'all
I used to be so obsessed that lipstick
and now I can't I can't rock with it
anymore it's too light but this one
again is kinky so that's kinky you can
see it's just like a lighter more pink
version of wire but I really like it and
these don't really smell like anything
right in my opinion they're really
smooth mmm they're like super smooth I
could like rub my lips all day with that
so awesome um oh I also got this because
I plan on a traveling the more within
the next like week or two so I got this
because if you watched my blowy skin for
weight glowing glowing skin if you
watched my glowy makeup for oily skin
video I used the argon illuminizer which
is like her liquid won by josie maran
and i saw this one in store and i was
like that is so perfect for traveling
it's basically like the same exact thing
but in the stick form so let me show you
so you can see right there it's that
gorgeous Luminizer that's just so
stunning and I just I love it so that's
it right there I just love the fact that
they
mystic form because the other one the
the liquid one sometimes in that bottle
it squeezes out too much and you do not
need a lot of that product at all okay
so the last two things I have to show
you guys our bronzers because I can't
seem to go and just Sephora and not get
a bronzer every single time I don't know
what it is the Stila all-day bronzer for
face and body this is in the shade
medium I really like this shade because
it has a more of an ashy tone to it this
is what the packaging looks like it's
okay I mean it's nothing crazy good you
know I'm saying but it has a huge huge
mirror as you can see it's like the size
of my face and yeah this is again more
of an ashy bronzer which I really like I
could use this for so many different
things these that the contour I could
also use it to bronze but that's what it
looks like I would use it more as a
contour shade and then I went bronzing
yeah and this seems really really smooth
and easy to blend I'm really excited to
try that out and then the last thing the
last thing I got is this Too Faced cocoa
contour chiseled to perfection face
contouring and highlighting kit and I'm
really excited about this I think this
is going to be such a great palette this
is what it looks like it has a nice
little mirror in here don't look at my
3030 this then you have light cocoa
medium cocoa dark cocoa and pop of light
and then there's a bomb little brush
right here which I'm excited to use
because it's a really nice angled little
kabuki which would be great so I'm
really kind of buff in some product
right here okay so here are all the
shapes watch again my cocoa medium cocoa
dark cocoa and then pop of light and
yeah
medium is definitely gonna be more of a
contour shade for me dark would be more
of a bronzer with like a stippling brush
okay guys so that is it for this video I
really hope you enjoyed it if you did

forget to subscribe and also speaking of
