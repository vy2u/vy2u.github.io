video first off I want to say I'm sorry
I've been gone for so long I haven't
posted a video in a week
I think it's been and I'm so sorry if
you've been following me on Twitter and
Instagram you know I was out of town in
LA for six days which is I think the
longest I've been out of town for like
in a while
other than my birthday so really long
time it's been a lot of time in LA I had
a lot of fun I went to some meetings and
I got to kind of explore LA so it was
super fun and I got some time to do some
shopping and as you can tell by the bag
I brought the back home with me and it
kind of got beat up along the way but I
wanted to show you it and I wanted to
put it in the thumbnail so it was like
survived but I have not been to Sephora
since the beginning of January I think
if you've been watching my videos for
the past couple months I've been using a
lot of drugstore products and I just
ever I haven't been to Sephora so I
decided it was finally time so the first
thing I got was this Smashbox photo
finish primer water and I was really
skeptical about this because I think I
saw this back in January when took when
I went to a Sephora um and I just I
don't know if it's silicone alcohol and
oil free and I'm always skeptical of
things like this I've used makeup
setting sprays and everything and for me
they've just never done anything for me
and I don't necessarily like them but I
have heard nothing of a great things
about this primer so I was like alright
I'll give it a try I've put it off for
long enough so hopefully I enjoy it and
yes this is oil free and alcohol free I
figured it'll be great for my sensitive
skin and that's what it looks like it
just looks like water water in a bottle
you know it probably just poured Dasani
in this bottle and sold it for 40 bucks
anyway don't mind my eye makeup today
I've used a different liner to smudge
out because I've been smudging out my
liner on the top instead of doing winged
liner and I used a different liner today
and um it wasn't easy to work with let
me just say that okay so the next thing
I got was this Giorgio summer's day I
feel like I have to say a fancier
or else amazing they're like butcher me
the next thing I got was this giorgio
money lip maestro and tits velvet color
and this isn't a number 202 and I
originally got the lipstick of this I
picked it up and I was going to buy that
but then I saw this and I think it's
like along the lines of a liquid
lipstick pretty sure the same exact
color as the lipstick I was gonna
purchase but I was like hey this is a
lot easier to use and I personally like
the more liquid lipsticks and I do
regular ones so this is a shade right
here very pretty more of a darker nude
with like a pink undertone to it oh it's
so pretty a perfect everyday color it's
very very pigmented and it does last a
really long time on the lips and I also
love the doe foot applicator it makes it
really easy just to get right on your
Cupid's bow and just really blend all
this out thing I purchased was this
Smashbox blush and heartbreak I think
this is a permanent item um okay okay
just this is a blush it just pops up
like this
oh wait does it yes so this is what the
blush looks like just a really nice
neutral peachy pink color very very
pretty it's more peach than pink
definitely and that's my kind of color
so that's it right there
really pretty shade it blends really
well and it's just very very very smooth
you can see it just blends so well into
the skin so love that very pretty this
product I was in Sephora and I was like
oh my god this is what I need cuz I saw
this on Instagram and I was like oh my
god I need that in my life I went to go
and pick it up and it look like it was
all out but I found the last one and I
was like that's how you know it's meant
to be this is a NARS dual intensity
blush in jubilation no but this has two
highlighters and you have a gold shade
in a peach shade so that is what it
looks like oh my gosh they are so oh
they're so pretty and these are just
ideal for traveling this one's the peach
you want this one's the goal one goal
one does remind me a little bit of heat
wave it's just
a little more goal actually now it's a
lot more gold than heatwave but they are
absolutely beautiful with a tan oh these
are gonna be so beautiful now this is a
product I have not seen anyone talk
about it I am in love with it I started
using it I was out of town and I was
like oh my god and love this so this is
by Becca and it's the low light
highlight palette and they had I think
two or three different shades and this
is a packaging very sleek and pretty
because you have like this really nice
mirror and then here are the shades this
reminds me of opals so much I wonder if
this is opal it doesn't say on the
packaging but if I swear this has to be
opal like it is oh so pretty so that's
the highlight shade right there if you
can see it oh it's so pretty that's
gotta be opal and then this contour
shade is super nice very very very very
very pigmented and it does have more of
an ashy undertone so I like this one to
contour as well this product you do want
to kind of be careful and not like a dip
your brush in there you just want to tap
it in there tap off the excess and
that's enough for your face so just be
careful that it's a very pigmented but
this stuff is awesome I love this what
is it low light highlight palette
amazing I'll leave the color name that I
used in the description box below
everything is about face in this haul -
that there's not a foundation in here I
also got the Marc Jacob this I also got
the Marc Jacobs insta Marc light filter
and contour palette again I've seen this
everywhere the first thing I notice
about this house that I love is the
packaging I'm not I have never owned
anything from our Jacobs like face
product wise so it's so slim you could
pop this in your purse and it would just
be fine and you push the little button
in it and it just opens up like this you
have a huge mirror and then you have the
highlight shade in the contour shade the
main reason why I really like this one
is because I do have the Kat Von D shade
and light palette absolutely adore it I
have been using the yellow highlight
powder all the time and I know I'm about
to hit pan soon so I figured why not
pick this one up and use this one as
well it is a very
nice powder it's very very finely milled
and it just blends out really seamlessly
and then the contour shade again is very
nice as well it is more of that actually
toned but I I love it and this one isn't
as dark as the Becca one but it's
perfect just to create a little bit of
shadow underneath your cheekbones so I'm
very excited to use this I haven't used
it on my face yet but I'm excited to
test it out there's so much stuff in
here next I got two more Kat Von D
everlasting liquid lipsticks I
absolutely adore Lolita when Lolita was
back in stock
I have lost my first one so I made sure
I picked up two and I have the darkest
shade from her as well but I want to get
some more for summer and this one is the
one that I meant no this was the one I
meant to get this ones in Berlin and
it's just a really pretty coral pink
shade and I just I think it's gonna be
so pretty with it tan and I just love
these they dry matte and it's just it's
so pretty like look it's already drying
Mac right now so love this I'm really
excited wear this color and then this
nice color I didn't mean to get so I'm
gonna pop my little stuff in just before
a suit and exchange this for a different
color
I'm not into hot pinks like this I just
I don't like them on me I don't think
they flatter me really well but if
you're wondering this is backstage Bambi
and it's a very electric hot pink I also
got this which I'm really excited about
it's the makeup forever step one skin
equalizer
it's the mattifying primer so far I'm
loving it I'm still kind of testing it
out to see how I really like it but I
mean so far so good I do like it I've
only used it about three times but I
really feel like I need to use it for a
little bit longer to give you guys a
really good rundown on it and kind of
use it with different products and if
you're wondering it has a really cool
tip too
I feel like nobody ever shows this part
of the primers but it has a really cool
tip and it's basically kind of like a
gel consistency what this reminds me of
is the Becca matte primer just the way
it drives in the texture of it but it's
not as drying as the Becca primer it's a
little bit more forgiving so you're not
gonna have like white flakes all over
your face and it's not going to be too
dry
this is something I've had so many
questions about usually if I use mascara
and I'm not wearing false lashes I'll
use my - face - better than sex just
because I really love it but a lot of
you asked me about this one which is the
benefit roller lash mascara has a lot of
different claims basically you don't
need to use your lash curler anymore
which I've got to use my lash curler so
I'm excited to test this out for you
guys and see how it works and I really
do like the packaging I think it's
really cute and this is kind of
rubberized as well as the first time
opening it and then that's the wand
I love ones like this it reminds me of a
thicker L'Oreal telescopic with a curved
- but I love ones like this so hopefully
you'll get some good news out of it this
is something that I have had in my cart
online for forever and I kind of go back
and forth with it and I couldn't decide
if I want to splurge or not but I
decided to go ahead and get it when I
was in the store because I was like I'm
on semi vacation so it's totally okay
I'll just regret when I get home but I
won't regret it now is Yvonne she
Universal nude powder and this is a
matte translucent loose powder and I
love the packaging of this I mean man it
is so pretty
basically you just twist it and then pop
it off as most of you know I love the
Laura Mercier translucent powder it's
one of my favorites I used it for so
long but I just I'd like to try new
powders and kind of see what's going on
and what's new so yeah I got this one
and I can't wait to test it out if I can
get this dang thing off
I get off fancy with it too they have
like little G's because it kind of
smells I feel like maybe I'm crazy well
damn that's mad
that's what I'm talking about oh this
might be a new favorite powder shut up
that's amazing I barely used any of that
a barely any was on the puffs whoa let's
hope I am join us tomorrow keep you guys
updated but so far I'm loving it we're
coming into the time of the year where
oily skin girls need powders
I need my powder so I'll definitely let
you know if it's worth the money hold
off on buying it and I'll let you know
and then oh I'm so excited about this to
make up for ever Pro sculpting duo in
number two everyone says that the
highlighting this is a dupe for Mac's
whisper of guilt and I was like hey why
not the packaging of this I don't know
what it is it's really simple and basic
but I'm just obsessed with it I don't
know did that give you anxiety when I
saw something around but I just I love
the packaging of this I love the snap
closure I just think it's so pretty and
this is what it looks like it has more
of the gold highlighter and then this
bronze right here which is more of like
a terracotta orange bronzer but I
personally like it I know some people
said they weren't gonna use it but I
will definitely use this as like a blush
or something because I don't know I just
I think that's a blush it would be
pretty you could even mix it with
different blushes to make it work so you
don't just like leave that part of the
palette hanging but that's what that
looks like it's so similar to a heatwave
a by Estee Lauder to me it's just a
little let me see I get any wave pull
done
I have everything still I have all my
makeup down here because I'm one about
Austin this week oh my sister cuz we're
gonna see kit more in concert so I saw
up with so much stuff packed up because
I'm like I don't want to pack it yet
oh yeah it's really really really
similar to heatwave so this one right
here is the one from the palette and
this is heat wave heat waves just a
little bit more a little bit more gold
and this one's a little bit obviously it
looks more peachy it doesn't look like
it in the pan where's that in the pan it
doesn't look like it's really peachy but
on my skin it's coming off a little
peach so but very very similar I mean if
you couldn't get heat waves definitely
check it out oh and I I hey what you
called it renewed my vib rouge they give
you this little ass lipstick like can I
get a fifty dollar off coupon or
something I mean I'm not hating on the
lipstick it's cute but can I get a fifty
dollar off coupon I mean come on and
then the last thing I got is different
from me but I'm super excited about is
the Saint Tropez self tan dark brown
things bright I've used the mousse of
this before and I did like the mousse
it's just sometimes it looked a little
too green on my skin so I don't know I
don't know what possessed me to get this
actually I think it's just because I'm
obsessed right now with spray bronzers
and I wanted to try this one out and
believe this one is the self-tanner
though it's not just a bro yeah this is
actually a self-tanner not like just a
bronzing spray so I'm excited to use
this especially for my hands my hands
are always the worst as you can see I
don't have any self tan on my body right
now I just have a little bit of Sun from
when I was in California so I'm not like
as fair as I really am um but anyways
excited to try this we'll definitely
I'll definitely let you guys know how I
love it and yeah we'll see how it goes
okay guys so if that is it for this haul
