a Sephora haul I I'm so excited I don't
want to do another Sephora haul for a
while you guys know there almost died
you guys know there's a ton of new stuff
out and I wanted to repurchase a couple
things and in the process I explore it
and found some other stuff
and by the way I am wearing a top I'm
wearing two tank because or like a
spaghetti strap because is blazing in
this room right now and my makeup I did
not even expect to go full glam with my
makeup but let me just quickly say you
guys need to go snatch this NARS palette
the name of this is narcissus l'amour
toujours L'Amour I don't know it's the
eyeshadow palette and I had no idea I
was gonna like this as much as I do like
this is a beautiful palette I'm like
dipping into the blue-green and just
loving it and I put the black on first
and I was like okay well I guess I'm
doing a smoky look now because I can't
take this back so I just did this smokey
eye if you guys wanna see this let me
know I really like the way that it
turned out and the eyeshadows are such
great quality like the black in here
blends so well I just oh so good
definitely go pick that up I'm gonna
show you guys all the stuff that I got
from Sephora if you're wondering this
necklace is from Lulu's and these
earrings are forever 21 but yeah let's
get started first I'm gonna talk about
caviar so the reason why I'm basically
mentioning caviar is because I did
purchase this but caviar also sent me a
care package with this in here well not
in here but they sent me one in a PR
packet and I was like damn they must
have known that ordered one because I
had ordered one and I just sent this one
so this is the caviar anti-aging miracle
multiplying volume mist so they sent
this over caviar as one of my favorite
favorite brands for my hair so thank you
so much to them for sending this to me I
also purchased this and they sent me one
in here and I was like oh wait do this
to me
you know what no but this is why I used
on my hair today I really like it it's
the caviar perfect texture finishing
spray I love this it adds a lot of
texture to your hair and that's what I
have in my curls right now but they also
sent over the working hair the working
hairspray ultra dry control I've never
used this so I'm excited to try it out
also sent over a shampoo and conditioner
this is the body building volume shampoo
and conditioner so I can't wait to try
this out I do have a lot of hair but I
have fine hair so sometimes it's hard to
get a lot of volume as you guys can see
it's like pretty flat up top but down
here it's like the luminous it's just
it's just hard to get volume this one's
also a thick and full volume mousse and
then the last thing they sent over which
I'm sad to try you guys know I love my
macadamia deep repair mask I have been
using that for years I don't think I've
ever talked about another mask but they
stamp the replenishing moisture mask so
I can't wait to try it okay so now we're
going to get onto the good stuff and
this I'm so excited about but let me
tell you this is expensive I got one of
these at the checkout line um and I
think it was like twelve dollars was a
sample size and I fell in love after the
first use like I knew I loved it and I
had to buy another one because this is
my new favorite exfoliator it literally
feels it does smell very spa-like but it
feels like a spa on your face - it is
absolutely amazing and it's the Kate
Somerville exfoli Kate intense
exfoliating treatments for all skin
types
and let me tell you this stuff is
amazing guys it's amazing I said amazing
I'm being a little too excited I really
recommend it if you just don't feel like
your exfoliator is really doing the job
and really getting that dead skin off
please check this out go get the sample
size and just test it out because I know
this is expensive it's definitely
something that you have to invest in
this two fluid ounce I believe was I
don't know it was expensive but I
promise you it changes your skin's life
like it feels so good your skin feels
super soft it feels refreshed and I just
I love it this is like my number one
exfoliator right now I think this
is absolutely amazing out of any
exfoliator I have tried nothing compares
to this okay this is something really
cool really different and I saw this
online and I was like sorry this annoy
me got this online and I was like oh my
god what you're reaching out to lowly
girls and I like it that's why I like
bullsháá bullsháá is on my favorite
brands and this is a bozhe white
charcoal mattifying makeup setting spray
so basically it says preservative free
artificial fragrance and color free
gluten free bubble 4 and basically it's
a fine mist that minimizes pores gently
mattifies insects makeup while keeping
skin hydrated pores are strengthened and
tightened with a concentrated treatment
of artichoke leaf extract and a black
tea skin is left shine free hydrate and
makeup is locked in place you can use
this before your makeup and after your
makeup this is a hell of a size like it
is huge I've only tried it once and you
can really feel it drying on your skin I
know your pores aren't like minimizing
right thin but it feels like your pores
are tightening and it just looks really
good and it does set to a matte finish
so so far I like it I don't know a final
review yet but I will keep you guys
updated because I think this is really
cool eating a bozhe I did get the
charcoal pour pudding it says it will
minimize the appearance of pores while
balancing skin for ideal results which
is what I need
clarifies pores by removing dirt oil and
impurities and moisturizes and balances
the skin by increasing hydration and it
boosts the benefits by reducing excess
oil without depriving the skin of key
moisture the skin is left a deeply
cleansed and balanced hello I'm oily my
skin needs to be balanced because if
it's not balanced my skin will be super
oily and it just becomes a hot mess this
is a really cool looking product and I
really can't wait to try this out okay I
don't want to take the top off but
that's what it looks like it's black and
white and it just looks really awesome
and then I had to purchase my glam glow
clearing treatment this is my bestie I
love it if I just feel like my skin is
not happy and it's just breaking out it
just looks a hot mess
I will exfoliate with the exfoliate and
then I will use this and I feel like it
just makes my skin look so good and it
clears on my skin I've purchased so many
of these and I swear by I don't like the
black one and I just did a disappointing
products on another gland blow mess so
if you want to see what that is I'll
link that video down below but this one
is by far my favorite and I will always
spend my money on this because I think
it's the bomb oh I got this BB repair
blow dry cream can see how that works
out so next is the tarte maracuja rain
forest blow it's an instant matte
waterproof body Perfector and I've never
tried this before but it's infused with
maracuja oil and it's supposed to be
rich in vitamin C and essential fatty
acid and streak-free blah blah blah so
I'm going to see how this works I want
this for events coming up and going to a
couple formals and I have to show my
legs and cocktail dress here in a few
weeks or in a week or so not long but I
wanted to try something like this out to
kind of even out the skin and make it
look really airbrushed and glowy and
just really pretty you know when the
light hits your legs you want your
life's look shiny or your skin like I
went a little crazy with the
highlighting today but because I want to
look glowy so I'm hoping that this works
for me
and yeah I can't wait to try it out let
me know if you guys have tried this
because I've never tried it
I think it's been around for a while we
have one skin care product left and then
we have makeup so this is the tatcha
Indigo soothing silk body butter people
have been going crazy
for this brand it this word is expensive
to like I what did I want to try from
them there was something that was online
I wanted to try but they completely sold
out so I haven't been able to try it I
don't know what it was this is like
really nice packaging Wow okay so how
much do you get in here you go six point
seven fluid ounces which i think is a
great deal
oh it's it oh it's blue mmm smells good
it kind of smells fall-like so this will
definitely be something I probably apply
before bed I usually like to apply my
body butters before bed so I will
totally keep you guys updated on if I
like this or not because I think with
this brand you really have to stay
updated because it is expensive okay and
then the next thing from this touch of
rain this is the last skin care product
but this is a pure one stamp stamp Oh
what my
is it pure one-step camellia cleansing
oil I believe it says date camellia but
it's a beautiful blend of that oil rice
bran oil
I don't know basically it just says it
melts away even waterproof cosmetics
leaving skin freshman pure I want to try
something like this just because again
my rosacea I've been using the clinic
cleansing balm for ever because I love
that stuff I think it's amazing and I've
also used the bozhe one oh and it's so
good so I can't wait to try this one out
and see how well it works hopefully it's
just balm in a bottle okay so I don't
have a ton of makeup stuff but these
stuff that I do have I'm excited to
share with you guys and the first one I
want to show you is this I actually have
it on my cheeks right now which is what
I want to share it with you
it's the Kat Von D shade light blush and
this one is in the Hansel and Gretel duo
and I really like the idea of this
because I feel like you have three
blushes in one so basically what it is
is a two-part side you obviously have a
lighter shading of darker shade she has
multiple shades to that you can choose
from but the idea behind it is to use
this darker shade on the outer parts of
the cheek and then the lighter shade on
the inner part of the cheek around your
apple area before I read the directions
on this I mixed them together and I
really like the way that they look too
so today for this look I just used this
shade but earlier today I mix them both
together for a different look that I had
on I know two looks in one day it's
excessive I mix them both together and
they looked really good so you basically
have three blushes in one I don't think
they're that expensive and the packaging
is great you can see the colors so Kat
Von D always killed I also want to
mention that this blends out very very
well this is another product that I have
tried and I like it I actually have it
on my collarbones and the balls my
shoulder and I also have my Charlotte
Tilbury
if you ever say her name I also have
these Charlotte Tilbury highlight on top
as well but this is the NARS Luminator
and hot sand and I have been wanting to
get this I thought this was limited
edition but I'm guessing it's not this
is what it looks like I really like it
on like bronze to skin this is beautiful
this looks gorgeous on the face as well
it's just a peachy champagne kind of
highlight but it's definitely more on
the peachy
side and I love it it is so pretty you
guys I'm I'm obsessed to this already
okay another thing I'm actually wearing
right now are these velour lashes in a
fluff and wispy and you guys I love
these I need to buy more like I already
know I need to buy more and I just got
this in today but I'm wearing them right
now and these are my favorite style of
lashes right now just because they are
so literally fluffy and wispy like they
are amazing I can't find these in stores
I can only find them online the fluff in
line they have the regular line in
stores but I want this one
I like the fluff in line a lot better
but I'm so excited to have these back in
my life I'm going to try and keep the
round for as much as possible because
you can reuse these lashes multiple
times moving on to things I haven't
tried but I'm really excited to so this
is different for me I don't normally go
for green tinted things to neutralize my
face I usually just go with a full
coverage foundation and I'm set
just good sometimes I really don't feel
like piling on the product I know my
face is Paulo right now but I mean like
most the time I don't feel like putting
on up after I put on primer I don't want
to put on extra stuff before I profound
ation but this is the YSL color
corrector in green and this had great
reviews online and I was like you know
what it has really great views I'm
giving a shot I don't know if I should
do first impression or not I haven't
played with it at all I don't even want
to open it like twist it open until or
however you uses but if you guys want
like a first impression on this or a
review let me know because why still
isn't a cheap brand I will be more than
happy to let you guys know what I think
of it I feel like it's worth it um and
if it's something I would put into my
daily routine because I usually like I
said don't go for something like this
but since it has such great reviews I
just felt like I couldn't pass it up I
have no idea that this was going to be
so light and I was looking forward to
this foundation so this is definitely
going back is see Kevin tequan sensual
skin fluid foundation and it doesn't say
anything on the back of it it just says
foundation I'm pretty sure this is
supposed to be like really good for oily
skin from the reviews that I saw online
this color is not
I mean whatsoever like just not at all
so we have to take it back but it has
cool packaging you just open it and then
you have a little drop or you drop it
all whatever cool packaging but I'm
really surprised at how bad I was off on
the color because online it didn't look
that light so I got the shade s fo5 so
if you're around my shade don't get this
one okay last two things again this is
another foundation I can't decide if I
want to do a first impression or a
review and demo on it but it is the Dior
skin forever hope perfection makeup C
everlasting wear pore refining makeup
supposedly this is supposed to be really
really great for oily skin it's like the
newest foundation from them it says it's
a fluid non greasy texture perfectly
blends with this game for an immediate
matte finish with no mask effect okay
throughout the day it provides optimal
comfort and flawless wear day after day
the skins texture appears are fine and
surface and its surface beautifully
enhanced so I mean that sounds pretty
damn good to me and I got the shade o
3/5 desert beige I don't know if this is
going to be too light for me I haven't
even tried it yet I don't know I'm gonna
have to see I think I'm going to go to
uh Sephora store next week and if this
is too light I'll just exchange and then
the last thing I got this because it
reminded me so much of these cash box
insta matte and this is the bite Beauty
matte cream weight is the matte lip
crayon and what it says is nothing it
says absolutely nothing on it but from
what I read online you could put this
over any lipstick I haven't gloss on now
so it's really not there's no point in
me doing it now but you're supposed to
be able to put this on any lipstick and
make it matte which is kind of what wow
it's white it's a little weird the
Smashbox insta matte is clear this one's
white you have to read up on that
because from what I read it's supposed
to be like you put a lipstick down put
this on top and it mattifies it blends
not really well but
I would expect that to alter the color
of the lipstick I don't I'll try it out
let you guys know what I think of it if
you guys are try to let me know how you
use it I'm all about hearing it this
video was probably super long but I hope
you guys enjoyed it if there's any
