today I'm going to be doing a Sephora
haul for you we got a big bag the other
day and I did not expect to get a big
bag because I went in to get stuff for
throwback Throwdown which I think by now
you would have seen the first throwback
throwdown right has the old products I
used to love yeah I went in there for a
couple things and I came out with this
big bag but enjoyed it and we designed
the first I want to remind you that my
pallets are for sale my highlight
pallets the pearl and gold I'm wearing
pearl right now these are for sale
online I'll put a link down below where
you can get them and again there's one
in Pearl and one in gold immediately the
video where I was telling you more about
these pallets I will leave that video
down below as well but I hope you guys
are liking them make sure you tag me in
your photos and before we get started
don't forget to subscribe so you don't
miss out on any of my videos and yeah
let's get started with this support haul
so the first thing is I got I'm just
going to do right through because as you
watch like any of my Sephora haul to the
past who knows how long you know I get
these every single time I go in store
but I needed some more via Liberata
self-tanning this and then I also got
this which I did a throwback throw down
on so I will leave that video down below
in my view before this one but I did get
the cap on D lock-it tattooed foundation
I'm wearing it right now if you want to
know what I think of it check out that
video but I want to test this out for
you guys again to see if I still love it
after all these years
next up I got my favorite lashes I'm
wearing them right now I'm still glad
that they carry these in store because I
love the velour fluff in line so like
these are the fluff and whispies they
have like fluff in dawnia and all the
other kind of stuff they're so
lightweight really easy to wear the band
is nice and flexible they're so
comfortable they're pricey but you can
reuse them so many times it's got four
of those because it's been a while since
I purchased some of these because they
are really expensive I've been using
some I lower lashes from Ulta there are
a lot cheaper than this but I saw them
and honestly just couldn't resist and I
needed more lashes so I got that and
speaking of more lashes I decided to try
out some tuna Beauty falsies and I think
I've tried a pair of hers once and the
band is kind of thick but I'm going to
try them again and see what I think so I
got said number eight which are really
with speed and fun and then I also got
number nine which are dramatic
Makenna lash that I like I'm a dramatic
girl and love dramatic lashes and
I also got number 11s which these look
like iconic goddess lashes on bang house
the black should know maybe they're
House of lashes House of lashes and
goddesses what they're immune and then I
also got a new perfume which I don't
know how I feel about yet in store I was
like oh not so good but now I'm like I
don't know how I feel the replica flower
market you guys I love floral scents and
I mean this is a floral scent cuz it's
called flower market by Suharto about it
yet I do like it I like that it smells
like flowers it honestly does oh my god
it does smell really good I just don't
know when I would wear it oh my gosh it
smells like flowers but like I said I
don't know when I would wear it so I'm
going to see if I'm going to actually
use it it's not I'm going to take it
back next up I got a new cleanser this
is from Sunday Riley it's the ceramic
flipped clay cleanser and it is purifies
the complexion visibly minimizes the
appearance of pores and removes excess
oils and impurities so I'm very excited
trying to set this for normal to oily
skin and I have high hopes because
Sunday Ronnie is really good brand 7
told you guys I'm highly considering IPL
for my rosacea because it's supposed to
help with youth redness and then there's
like another thing I don't know if it's
called micro needling or something this
must help with texture so really looking
into getting those because at least the
IPL for my redness because I really
wanted to tone down I'm going to keep
you guys updated as I try it out I also
got a data Liberata luxury tan body blur
and it's an instant HD skin finish
24-hour wear dis is basically like that
body makeup stuff so it blurs out any
imperfections give you it gives you a
nice glowy tan and it just looks good so
I want to try it out and have it tested
out Vita Liberata in a while so
hopefully this is good then I got this
this is the Anthony and grown hair
treatment for all skin types
now I saw this in the men's section but
when I was reading this I read the back
and it said developed for men borrowed
by women and I was like okay sold so
because I was on the fence about getting
it and then I read that and I was like
all right I got you I got you oh and
instead a portion of the proceeds from
the sale of this product is donated to
prostate cancer research
that is awesome basically it works to
remove dead skin
bacterium free trapped hair and Haswell
herb and lavender to soothe and calm the
skin even though I've been getting laser
I'm going down at once but I have seen a
difference even though I have been
getting laser I still get some ingrown
hairs so I figured I could use this and
then whatever I don't use I'll just give
this to Davis and Casey has an ingrown
hair I mean let you guys know I think of
this if you even follow me for a while
you know ingrown hairs in my bikini area
and stuff have been my trouble so I got
laser and I got this and then should be
good from that one and I got this
travel-size purity because I'm gonna be
traveling a little bit more and just
doing something be sure to get trouble
sides of that I also saw this is the
cinema secrets Pro cosmetics ultra
Lucent it says ultra loose setting
powder and it's in translucent so I've
never tried this before I don't even
know if the reviews are good but I want
to test it out because I know cinema
secrets is a good brand
hopefully we found a new powder that I
like recently I mean using that flower
beauty powder bags also been using this
one constantly and then see Cody airspun
loose face powder and has been really
loving it get the unscented time but
this is really good it's what I've been
using I repurchase this because it's
amazing it's the AL dentist firming and
lifting neck cream this makes my chest
in my neck so moisturized and I can tell
a difference when I don't use this
product like outfit lotion and step on
my neck and chest but nothing makes it
glow and look so moisturized and smooth
like this product I went through a whole
tube of this and I was like okay I need
to go get another one
I'm in love with it it's so good I
didn't see it on display at Sephora but
then I asked a girl about it and she got
this in the back I guess and I was like
thank you next up I wanted to try this
out I know this is more for like normal
to dry stand but I see so many people
use it and I just want to test it out
and see how good it is
it's the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
invisible foundation stick and this will
cover foundation sticks got to say why
for15 cuz yeah I want to see I've seen
so many who will use it and I just never
tested it out because I've been scared
too okay I'm gonna sit close to me mmm
even if it doesn't I'm not going to be
to disappoint I might go where tests on
it I want to test it out you know it's
been on my mind the Kat Von D lock-it
brightening powder and this is supposed
to be for your under-eye
it's a less wait no cake instant
under-eye brightening and it smooths the
under-eye area so I got the shade petal
and it's just in this little jar right
here so it is kind of pin tint it's like
a peachy tints and I'm a size 10 count
and see if it works really well for the
under eye areas I got two new things
from fresh and because I listen been
really dry lately I got the fresh sugar
cream lip treatment in buff that's what
that looks like and it's just a cream
carotids and it does have some shimmer
in it it's really nice I figured I could
use this for the days that I don't want
to wear like a lipstick or something I
would just wear this
so looks like that really pretty color
and really moisturizing also I hadn't
really tried a lot of fresh products so
I figured I would test these out and
like noticing a sugar a honey lip
treatment this has SPF 15 so I figures
you know is it last till summer it'll be
good for summer but that's the tube
looks like and then you owe or you twist
it all right and that's the color why is
it really so so dark
Obama dark so that's it right there just
a couple more things literally just two
more things I have the YSL baby doll
mascara again for my throwback throwdown
somebody tweeted me this and I was like
oh my god I totally forgot I used to be
obsessed with that mascara like I used
to love this and I guess this is so
pricey like I never reproach 6 I was
like oh I mean it's really great but
like do I really want to work out that
money right now and I decided to finally
just get it try it out again and see as
I loved as much as I used to so I'm
actually really excited about this
because I totally forgot about it last
thing I got into skincare items
cocktails luminous deep hydration a
firming eye serum I will be the first to
say that I haven't found a lot of tops
of products that work well for me I know
a lot of people love the brand for me I
just haven't found something that I'm
obsessed with for the price you know
what you mean I'm hoping this is good I
was looking for something that's a
little bit more moisturizing for my
under eye and I figured I would test
this out I'll show you what the product
looks like really quick it's just a
little sleazy too that is what it looks
like how pretty is the packaging but we
all know it's not about packaging for me
it has to work you know it has to work
do it okay guys so that is it for my
Sephora haul let me know again down
below if you think I should do another
Sephora haul with
other big package that's coming anything
