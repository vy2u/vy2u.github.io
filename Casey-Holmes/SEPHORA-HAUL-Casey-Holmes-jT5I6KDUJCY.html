a Sephora haul I went to Sephora
yesterday yesterday yes I went to him
yesterday and I exchanged some things
and got some more products so so forum
does it t everytime so I'm just gonna
show you guys what I got some things are
repurchases and some things are not so
let's just get started the first thing
obviously I had to repurchase the my
Vita Liberata self-tuning it's by far my
favorite myths that I have tried I just
love them I also love these self tanner
buy them and dark but recently I've been
using a different self tanner which if
you saw my November favorites you would
have seen I think of some of my
favorites um you want to see what I've
been using lately but I still love these
mitts best I just think they applied
self-tanner so amazingly and they're not
rough on your skin which I love this is
also repurchase this is the Clarins
one-step a gentle exfoliating cleanser
with orange extract this is for all skin
types
I was just really missing this I have
the philosophy one I forget what it's
called I'll put the name of it somewhere
in here but I loved this one it lasts me
forever and I honestly just missed the
scent the scent of the philosophy one is
just not that great and I just really
missed this one so I decided to
repurchase it it's a great exfoliator
for sensitive skin and it really gets
all of that dead dry stuff and a haul a
while back like it was a haul forever
oh I purchased a Dior serum that I
thought was for pores but it ended up
being the wrong one so I finally
returned it and exchanged it it wasn't
open or anything like that but I finally
exchanged it for this one this is the
Dior dream skin correction immediate so
this says that the skin of your dreams
instantly and over time it says the
first skincare baidu are capable of
instantly restoring a very beautiful
even in radiant skin while combating
wrinkles loss of firmament loss of
firmness spots and redness over time
there was also something about pores on
here too
this is a fine silky texture with a
luminous amazingly matte finish so I'm
really excited to try this
I had a subscriber recommend this to me
because of my pores and my redness so
I'm really excited to
that I finally got the right one because
I had a long one for literally months
and it was still wrapped up and
everything I just hadn't at the time
because Sephora is not that close to me
and I just had tons of time to stop and
go out there and I was like you know
what we need to go ahead and get this
done next up I got a bite Beauty lip
gloss and Coco this just looks so pretty
to me I love rambutan which is the one
that looks like this I love this lip
gloss I think their lip glosses are
great so Coco is just a little bit
darker it is basically like a cocoa
color like hot chocolate it's very very
pretty and these smell and taste pretty
good I like it a lot so that's Coco this
is so pretty I love
I didn't even swatch it in store I just
saw it in the tube and I was like yes
you mean for another lip product I did
get this Too Faced this la creme colored
register lip cream and sweet maple I do
like this color I think it's really
pretty I just think I'm gonna have to
put a lip liner underneath it and put
this one on top but that's what it looks
like right there I like the color I've
been loving these darker shades lately I
just think they're so beautiful so I
figured I would go ahead and pick this
one up because I think only have only
have like one color by them and it's a
really nude shade so I'm going to try
that one out so before I went to Sephora
actually posted a picture and asked you
guys what you would recommend and a ton
of you told me to try out these smashbox
step-by-step a contour stick trio and it
has a contour of bronze and a highlight
shade so this is what looks like I
actually purchased their little contour
palette a month and a half ago I have
been loving this palette I mean it is my
favorite contour palette right now I've
been used to get non-stop but I figured
since you guys recommended it I would go
ahead and try out these contour sticks
especially since they are new so let's
see
you know what you're just too patient
it's like come on get out of the
packaging okay so this is a bronze color
ooh that's really really creamy these
are super super creamy this is the
contour shade these wouldn't even be
really nice to just do a cream contour
first and then set with the contour
palette these are like insanely freakin
creamy and pigmented I'm really
impressed by this so I'm excited to try
these out I will definitely let you know
how I like them I've been loving one by
NYX recently if you haven't seen the
next one in stores this new NYX wonder
stick and I've been loving this the
color I got was deep and it's just so
nice I'll be doing it drugstore
favorites really soon for you guys I
showed this in my last video but I also
got the Laura Mercier smooth finished
flawless fluid I did a first impression
on her
silk cream foundation if you wanna see
that only get down below but I wanted to
try this one out because it said it had
a natural matte finish so this is what
the packaging looks like it's really
sleek and you just squeeze it out it
says it magically blurs imperfections
for a smooth seamless complexion light
weight and color true and offers visible
coverage with a natural matte finish we
will see we will see so next up I did
get the hourglass immaculate foundation
I used to use this so much back in the
day and then I think mine just expired
and I never repurchase them and I got
the shade of warm beige it looks like
it's gonna be pretty nice but it's a
liquid to powder finish it's mattifying
an oil-free definitely for the girls
with oily skin if you have any sort of
dry skin you do not want to try this out
because it is very intense and it's
gonna make sure you stay completely
matte so it will clean the dry patches
if you have any but for someone like me
who's always a greasy mess oh this is
really exciting I saw this when I was
just experimenting with some hourglass
products and I was like oh my gosh this
is the hourglass mechanical gel liner
and when I first saw this I was like
mechanical gel I was like why like gel
liner and mechanical is really easy so
oh why not it's a really thin one as you
can see but I want you to see how
pigmented this is that's barely touching
my skin at all and when I was leaving
the store
actually going to wipe off all the
makeup on my hand and this sucker did
not want to come off so I hope this is a
good product I would definitely keep you
guys updated lately I've been loving
that Revlon one I can't remember when I
called the hall but I had a Revlon
eyeliner in it and I've been loving that
so we'll see if that can top it
I also got two Beauty blender cleanser
solids if you're wondering the
japonesque solid cleanser that I got
from Ulta and that one haul it is
nothing compared to this this is still
my favorite and I was like oh my god I
need brush cleansers like right now so I
went ahead and got two of them and then
I also bought another Beauty Blender
because I needed another one I just have
three more things to show you the first
one is this Josie Maran Argan creamy
concealer crayon I got mine in a medium
one i swatched this and it was just so
creamy and it just seems like a really
amazing I could use it underneath the
eyes or something like that but I just
really I really liked it and I like the
color I think it's really nice so we
will see how I like that but it's so
creamy it kind of concerns because my
crease a little bit too much even if I
said with powder but never know till you
try so I figured why not and then I got
a new bronzer this is this one was a
splurge
it's the Guerlain terracotta bronzing
powder I don't think I own or have owned
anything from Guerlain I tried to have a
foundation from them but I actually
returned that when I went on this trip
but this isn't a shade oh five and I
didn't mention that really pretty
packaging so luxurious and gorgeous and
then this is the bronzer on the inside I
just think this is so stinkin beautiful
that's the color right there it is
really warm has more that terracotta
color to it but I just think to warm up
the skin this is gonna be so pretty and
I'll try the contour with it I'll see
how it looks but usually I'm contour
with really warm bronzers um but you
know it I was worth to try why not right
so yeah this is number five it's really
smooth and just that color so pretty and
then the last thing that I got I believe
new this is a Smashbox a photo filter
creamy powder foundation I kind of
laughed myself I was like photo filter
this is where our world is coming to
selfies and photo filter products but
this is a really nice packaging you just
press this and open it up and then you
have your product right there I got the
shade number seven and it's a creamy
powder foundation it's not lying when it
says it's very very creamy it's a very
smooth and pretty product so I know my
hands we're not even going to talk about
it they've been so dry with this weather
and self tanner is just like no I'm not
having that life but this is what that
powder looks like if you can see it
right there I think it'll be nice I'll
just have to apply it on my face I don't
plan on using it alone just because I
don't really use powder foundations like
that but I like to set my makeup with
stuff like this or just bronze my skin
so yeah I like the packaging on this
though it's like really sleek and pretty
it just I like a lot and it comes with a
sponge and a mirror take all this off
see look
you have to like rub hard for this to
come off which I will be right in a
little bit but that isn't it okay guys
so that is all that I got from Sephora I
hope you enjoyed this haul I love doing
hauls for you guys I think they're fun
and I just love playing with new
products so let me know what you've been
loving is down below in the comments
whatever if it's high-end drugstore like
I said I'll be doing the drugstore
favorites soon I want to incorporate a
makeup tutorial in here somewhere
because I feel like I was doing a lot of
makeup tutorials at one point and now I
feel like I'm doing a lot of non makeup
tutorials so I kind of want to balance
it out so I hope you guys will see that
very soon though and yeah I hope you
enjoyed this video thank you guys so
much for watching and don't forget to
like the video and subscribe and I will
see you all in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
